0,Leofwine_draca,Average B-movie is a fun watch but highly overrated,5,23 December 2016,"SNAKES ON A PLANE is something different: a cheesy B-movie hyped beyond belief and championed as one of the best so-bad-it's-good films of all time. Now, I've seen plenty of B-movies, some involving snakes, many involving other types of bugs and creatures, and I have to say that this is a fairly typical example of the genre. It's not particularly bad, it's not particularly great, but it has pace and drive that compensates for the dumb script and the focus on inanity throughout. Sure it's a big, bloated, clichéd mess of a B-movie but it's worth a look for fans of the genre who don't expect too much from it.Probably the most enjoyable part of the film for me was the boarding section, in which we witness all of the clichéd passengers who'll be on the plane. It's as if the cameraman has a clipboard and is ticking off each cliché as they arrive: stuffy British businessman (check), mother and baby (check), kids (check), pretty blonde with cute dog (check), black rapper with hulking dumb bodyguards (check), kick-ass cop (check), resourceful stewardess (check), gay steward (check), blonde bimbo and boyfriend (check). The list is endless and, obviously, most of the fun here derives from working out who's going to bite it – or get bitten, in this case.If you've seen one B-movie like this, you've seen them all. This would have been forgotten instantly as a back-shelf straight-to-DVD title were it not for Samuel L. Jackson, who is admittedly good as the tough cop. Sure, he's sleepwalking through the role, but he's having a ball. Sadly none of the other actors or actresses here can match the big man, especially not Nathan Phillips (so good in WOLF CREEK) and the almost unrecognisable Julianna Margulies, who seems to have had a ton of plastic surgery since her E.R. days. The special effects are pretty awful, with the CGI looking like CGI throughout, but the action scenes are quite competently staged. The film also scores points for the re-shoot which saw an extra handful of adult scenes added in to boost the rating, these include swearing, nudity, and some nice bloody effects that keep things moving along. It's dumb, cheesy and annoyingly aimed at the teenage market again, like THE MARINE, but SNAKES ON PLANE is okay. I won't be coming back to it, but I had a good time the once.",Snakes on a Plane
1,SnoopyStyle,It gives exactly what it promises,7,27 June 2014,Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) witnesses the murder of a prosecutor by the gangster Eddie Kim in the Hawaiian jungle. The gang is after him but FBI agent Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) rescues him. They go on the red eye to LA for Sean to testify against Eddie Kim. Claire Miller (Julianna Margulies) and Tiffany (Sunny Mabrey) are the flight attendants. They and the rest of the passengers have to battle countless deadly snakes that are unleashed by the gangsters.The title says it all and the movie delivers exactly that. It's fun. It's stupid. It's not high minded. I got what I expected and what I wanted. SLJ does this in his sleep. The lead guy could be better but that's a small complaint. The snakes do actually scare. B-movies don't get a lot better than this.,Snakes on a Plane
2,Hitchcoc,From Pulp Fiction to This,2,11 January 2017,"I guess I can understand that there are simply things that people enjoy and gravitate toward. We eat hamburgers piled with three kinds of cheese, onion rings, bacon, and grease flowing out the sides. This is personal choice. But it ain't good for us. If it were 1955, we could understand someone making a movie for a couple thousand bucks with virtually no plot and a bunch of inept actors. When the result was held to the fire we'd say, ""What did you expect?"" What we have here is a movie that is just plain stupid. The events leading to the snakes escaping and killing people on the plane are ludicrous. So why would there be a positive review. For the aforementioned reasons and the fact that the TV ads showed all that was in the movie---nothing worth watching. I saw Samuel Jackson yelling and that was the movie. Please don't bother with this. I already sacrificed two hours. I did it for you.",Snakes on a Plane
3,claudio_carvalho,"Silly, But Very Entertaining",7,22 April 2007,"While practicing motocross in Hawaii, Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) witnesses the brutal murder of an important American prosecutor by the powerful mobster Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson). He is protected and persuaded by the FBI agent Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) to testify against Eddie in Los Angeles. They embark in the red-eye Flight 121 of Pacific Air, occupying the entire first-class. However, Eddie dispatches hundred of different species of snakes airborne with a time operated device in the luggage to release the snakes in the flight with the intent of crashing the plane. Neville and the passengers have to struggle with the snakes to survive.""Snakes on a Plane"" is silly movie and full of clichés, but also very funny, full of action. This is the type of movie that you must shut down your brain and enjoy the dark catastrophe on board of a plane, with the snakes attacking and many passengers dying, others surviving. Samuel L. Jackson is cool in the role of the heroic FBI agent assigned to protect an important eye-witness. The purpose of this film is to entertain the audiences and it is well succeeded. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Serpentes a Bordo"" (""Snakes on Board"")",Snakes on a Plane
4,kosmasp,SoaP - would it help?,7,19 August 2020,"Do not watch the PG13 version of this. Just the fact that the infamous line ""I've had it with these mother.... snakes on this mother... plane"" is shortened (you can only use one F word apparently) is reason enough to leave that out and never even touch it.Now I thought this would have gone more crazy to tell you the truth ... but as it is, it still is crazy. Really nice cast though (Taylor Kitsch with quite the memorable role, though I have to admit I did not spot R.Kelly or Paris Hilton, who apparently cameo here, according to imdb) overall. And yes with a title like that you could be excused for hoping there'd be more mayhem. But even as it is now, it works. There are many things left unsaid and feel off a bit. But this is a strange movie and as Samuell L. Jackson says, this is not to be taken seriously (why would you? Though I wonder if the same applies to the Snakes on a train movie) and just be enjoyed for the carnage it creates. It does have the acting and comedic power to do so ... don't take it too seriously, just sit back ... it is ridiculous after all",Snakes on a Plane
5,classicsoncall,"""Wow, that's gonna leave a mark!""",7,1 December 2014,"During it's initial release, I had all I could do to convince a friend of mine to come see the picture with me. He had all the predictable arguments - it'll be stupid, he didn't like snakes, the idea was just too absurd, etc. I managed to prevail against his better judgment, and if I hadn't, the picture would never have become a topic of conversation even to this day. It just goes to show that sometimes you have to persevere.I knew that eventually I'd come around to watching this extravaganza again and so it shows up last night on one of the cable channels. What a blast! I can see why Samuel L. Jackson made a pitch to be in this flick because, well let's face it, who else can say they were in a picture as audacious as this one. Having been a bit of a reptile collector in my youth, I didn't have too much trouble picking out various snakes by name. Among the rubberized and CGI generated crawlers, I managed to make out a king snake, a corn snake, some cobras (including a spitting cobra), a rattler, a bunch of green snakes, and one of my all time favorites, a gaboon viper. Not all are recommended for micro-waving.So one might think the picture has no redeeming social value, but I have to say, I'd never have known that ophidiophobia is the fear of snakes if not for this film. If I had to bet, there's probably a name too for the fear of watching a movie with snakes in it. In any event, I think twice is enough for me, unless of course someone decides there's a sequel in here somewhere. If so, I'd offer up a few possibilities - like 'Sidewinders on Southwest', 'Boas on a Boeing', or perhaps even my favorite - 'Pythons on Pan Am'. For some reason though, I don't think it's gonna fly.",Snakes on a Plane
6,gavin6942,The Best Movie Ever (For How Not to Make a Movie),10,21 August 2006,"""Snakes on a Plane"" was a movie I knew about roughly a year before the release and I took in the fake songs, the fake trailers, enjoyed the sound clips and absolutely loved the title (It's ""snakes on a plane"", which you either get or you don't). When it finally came out this past weekend, I was almost sure I wouldn't go, because everyone -- even the fans -- knew the film would be stupid. But opening day rolls around and I'm consumed by the hype. I went the following Monday.Does this film deserve a 10? Absolutely not. I shouldn't give it one and neither should anyone else. Because this is not a ""great"" movie, it deserves no Oscars and won't go down as some piece of art. If anything, it might sweep the Razzies (Golden Raspberry Awards) with how incredibly awful the film is. But that's the brilliance of this film: you expect it to be bad, you go see it and it's bad and you walk away feeling torn apart -- even though you received exactly what you wanted.You could show this film to students on how not to make movies. Had I been at a test screening, I could have pointed out dozens of things that were sloppy and some that were just stupid. By now, many people are aware that the movie makers gave in to Internet hype and added the line ""I've had it with these ... snakes on this ... plane."" And I'm glad they did, because this line is by far the best line in the movie and a strong selling point. Other lines like ""going down faster than a Thai hooker"" didn't pack the punch the scriptwriter expected. The funny part is the big line was really poorly patched in: he utters it in a moment that is fairly calm and actually has no snakes whatsoever in the vicinity. His sudden agitation is completely unwarranted.The one other line that stands out is ""Do as I say, and you'll live!"" (because it was repeated three times). Some have hailed this as a great catch phrase, but it's more or less just a mangled and less powerful version of ""come with me if you want to live"". I know I prefer the latter.The deaths? Awful. The dead bodies and the snakes bites were very well done (good work, makeup) but the actual snakes attacks were cheesy and the bad CGI certainly didn't help. People get attacked in the most uncreative ways and the shock value is quite low. There are two victims you hope to see die in the movie -- only one does. (You'll understand when you see it.) By far the most annoying thing is ""snake vision"" or ""snake cam""... because apparently all snakes look at things the same way: through some sort of neon green mist. And the nude scene? About one of the least hot nude scenes in a film you'll find anywhere.The actors? You'll see a lot of ""that guy"" actors. Besides Samuel L. Jackson, you'll see Kenan from ""Kenana and Kel"", the Alicia Silverstone lookalike from ""Clueless"" (the TV version), the sports anchor from ""Anchorman"" and that one lady from that cop or lawyer show... yeah, I have no idea who half of them are and I'll probably never see them again. And the characters? Stereotypes of rappers, video game addicts, flight attendants and socialites. No depth to be found in any character.The best part: the soundtrack.... but you have to wait to the closing credits to hear the theme song and see the matching video.There's so much more wrong with this film, but I can't even think of what to add at this point... so for now accept my opinion that this film is the worst of the worst.",Snakes on a Plane
7,lee_eisenberg,"hopefully, we understand that the whole thing is total camp",10,18 March 2007,"OK, so we all know that the title explains the whole plot, and that Samuel L. Jackson makes a famously unsavory comment to describe his displeasure with the title characters. So, I should just be able to discuss certain other aspects. When the snakes attack people, they bite just about every body part (which is especially bad news for people who dare to have sex). Also, the snakes emerge from every opening in the cabin (including the toilet). If you remember the survival rules learned from ""Scream"", they also apply in ""Snakes on a Plane"".I remember a few months before this movie came out, Jon Stewart mentioned it as a joke on ""The Daily Show"" a few times: he showed a picture of Dick Cheney, Karl Rove and Bob Novak, and called them ""snakes on a Plame"" (in reference to the Valerie Plame case). Then, around the time that the movie came out, not only did he have Samuel L. Jackson on as a guest, but Samantha Bee interviewed a man and asked ""Could there be mother***king snakes on a mother***king plane?"" Anyway, it's the sort of absurd movie that's just a total pleasure to watch. It might make you want to go to Hawaii, study ophiology, or other things. But no matter what happens, you'll know what to do should you come across female-parent-copulating serpents on a female-parent-copulating airliner. Also starring Julianna Margulies and Nathan Phillips",Snakes on a Plane
8,jboothmillard,Snakes on a Plane,5,18 January 2009,"Apparently this film was hyped by the internet, possibly because of both the concept and the lead actor, but either way, it was a film I looked forward to trying from director David R. Ellis (Final Destination 2, Cellular). Basically, while in Hawaii, Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) witnesses powerful mobster Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson) murdering of an important American prosecutor. He is found quite quickly, but under protection by FBI agent Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) he escorts him to the Red Eye plane to Los Angeles, where Sean will testify against Kim. However, the FBI didn't think about Kim arranging for hundreds of species of poisonous snakes, sprayed with pheromones to make them more aggressive, being released (by a timer) and slithering their way around to bring the plane down. Neville is now on the case to kill and block the path of these dangerous serpents, and get the plane and all surviving passengers safely to Los Angeles. In the end, after saying his iconic ""I have had it with these mother f***ing snakes on this mother f***ing plane"", with all passengers strapped in, the windows are shot through, with all snakes being sucked by cabin pressure, the plane lands, and all bitten people have antidotes provided by a snake expert, oh, and Kim can be prosecuted for sure. Also starring Julianna Margulies as Claire Miller, Road Trip and Peep Show actress Rachel Blanchard as Mercedes, Bobby Cannavale as Hank Harris, Flex Alexander as Three G's, Kenan & Kel's Kenan Thompson as Troy, Terry Chen as Chen Leong and Sunny Mabrey as Tiffany. I will admit I can see reasons the critics give the film two out of five stars, and it pretty cheesy at times, just get past the first twenty minutes and ignore the final five or so, and just pay attention to the rest. The gimmicky title says it all, snakes all over the plane slithering under chairs, biting women's breasts, men's dicks, a kid and a black man's ass, it is similar to the feel of a B-movie, but Jackson and the CGI reptiles save this film from being a complete failure, it is a fun film. Worth watching!",Snakes on a Plane
9,Woodyanders,A great deal of wildly tongue-in-cheek fun,9,18 December 2008,"Easygoing surfer Sean Jones (a likable portrayal by Nathan Phillips) witnesses a mob hit and agrees to testify in court against the gangster who committed said hit. The mob tries to bump off Sean prior to the trial by unleashing a plethora of lethal poisonous snakes on board the plane Sean's on. It's to up super smooth FBI agent Neville Flynn (splendidly played with cool self-assurance by Samuel L. Jackson) to protect Sean and all the other passengers on board the plane. Director David R. Ellis and screenwriters John Heffernan and Sebastian Gutierrez fortunately don't take the gloriously ludicrous premise with total seriousness; instead they treat the story with a deliciously knowing sense of self-parodic humor that keeps things appropriately swift, funny, and exciting throughout. The snake attack sequences are every bit as brutal and gruesome as they ought to be; nasty highlights include an amorous young couple being killed while doing just what you think and one poor guy getting bitten right where it hurts most (ouch!). Moreover, Ellis adeptly develops a tremendous amount of gripping suspense and maintains a furiously brisk pace throughout. The passengers are an engagingly colorful bunch: Julianna Phlllips as the plucky Claire Miller, Sunny Mabrey as the perky Tiffany, Bruce James as the affable Ken, and Lin Shayne as the brave Grace are the flight attendants, plus there's high strung rap star Three G's (an amusingly neurotic Flex Alexander) and his bodyguards Troy (lovable lug Kenan Thompson) and Big Leroy (burly Keith Dallas), two little boys, cheery rich bimbo Mercedes (lovely blonde sprite Rachel Blanchard), a newlywed couple, and arrogant British snob Paul (a perfectly hateful'n'haughty Gerald Plunkett). Adding to the already infectiously crazed merriment is the highly lively and inspired mix of elements from the action, horror, comedy, and disaster genres. Granted, the animated CGI snakes are pretty hokey, but that only adds to the considerable wacky charm. Okay, we're not talking Oscar-worthy cinematic masterpiece here, but this much-hyped flick certainly delivers the promised hugely enjoyable over-the-top goods with a heady blast of sheer galvanizing go-for-it joy and energy that's impossible to either dislike or resist. A real rip-roaring pip.",Snakes on a Plane
10,Tweekums,Much better than I expected,7,16 March 2010,"When I saw this was going to be on television I had to watch it as all I'd heard about it suggested it could be so bad it is good, as it turned out it was quite enjoyable. Yes the plot was pretty simple; the title sums up the film. The plot about a witness being transported from Hawaii to LA on a passenger plane is clearly there as an excuse for somebody to release a crate full of deadly snakes onto the plane. I was expecting a second rate horror movie but found it to be closer to a disaster movie, it had all the classic elements; we are introduced to a cast of varied characters, something bad happens and several die and the survives rally together to try to survive.The hero of the story is FBI agent Neville Flynn played by Samuel L. Jackson, he is tasked with taking Sean Jones who witnessed a gang murder to Los Angeles. Obviously the easiest way for the gangster to stop the witness is to release hundreds of poisonous snakes onto his plane hoping that they will cause it to crash. When the snakes get released they bite many passengers, frequently in places which will make the viewer squirm a bit. The survivors must hold off the serpents till they can get to Los Angeles which might be difficult as the pilots have been bitten and the only person claiming flying experience has only played flight simulator games.On the plus side there were some nice scares and not all the characters I predicted would die did; in fact one ended up an unlikely saviour. Samuel L. Jackson was the obvious star who clearly knew it was a silly film but played it fairly straight raised this from a straight to DVD film to something better, the rest of the cast were pretty good though in their standard disaster movie roles. On the down side some of the people died in fairly gratuitous ways; did a woman trying to get into the mile high club really need to be bitten on her bare breast likewise I'm not sure the man going to the lavatory needed to be bitten on his penis. I'm not sure I'd recommend buying this unless you are a fan of cheesy disaster movies or are a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson, however it is worth watching if it is on television.",Snakes on a Plane
11,BA_Harrison,S-s-s-s-s-s-urprisingly fun!,7,10 June 2007,"Snakes on a Plane is the ultimate in high-concept movie-makingthe title says it all: there are snakes... lots of them... and they're on a plane.An intentionally cheesy film (and with a title like that, could it really be anything else?), director David R. Ellis's scaly summer blockbuster doesn't quite live up to the hype, but still manages to be a fun popcorn flick for those who don't want to have to think too much (or at all). Which means it's perfect fodder for the target audienceundemanding teenagers.Samuel L. Jackson plays Neville Flynn, an F.B.I. agent escorting a murder witness, Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) on a red-eye flight to Los Angeles, where he will testify against the evil Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson), head of a powerful criminal organisation. In an attempt to silence the witness before he can testify, Kim has arranged for a container of deadly snakes to be placed in the cargo hold, which is programmed to open once the plane is in mid-flight.In the tradition of disaster movies of the 70s, viewers are first introduced to a raft of one-dimensional characters (including a pair of young honeymooners, a Paris Hilton style socialite, a kick-boxer, a grumpy businessman, a rap star, a brave and beautiful stewardess, and a young mother with her child), any of whom might cark it before the closing credits. And then the snakes attack!The slithering stowaways (a mixture of real snakes and some dodgy looking CGI stand-ins) appear from every nook and cranny, sinking their fangs into passengers right, left and centre. Flynn, not one to be scared of a couple of hundred highly aggressive reptiles, helps survivors to safety and then proceeds to kick major snake ass (if, indeed, snakes actually have asses).Of course, in a film with a premise as daft as this, logic takes a back seat (actually, I don't think logic ever boarded in the first place), so viewers are advised to just sit back and enjoy the ride. I checked-in my brain before take off, and as a result, found Snakes on a Plane a pretty entertaining way to pass the time.",Snakes on a Plane
12,paul_haakonsen,An entertaining movie in its own right...,6,14 August 2017,"Right, well you know exactly what you are getting yourself into when you sit down to watch ""Snakes on a Plane"", no more no less.Actually ""Snakes on a Plane"" is a movie that I assume just about anyone who watch movies is familiar with, either by having watched it already or at the very least by its pseudo-cult status.The storyline in ""Snakes on a Plane"" is quite simplistic and demands nothing from the audience. So you essentially just lean back and enjoy the rampaging snakes and cheesy one-liners thrown at you on the screen. The story, shortly summarized, is about a commercial airliner that becomes under siege by a vast number of enraged poisonous and venomous snakes.Despite the cheesiness of the movie, then it is actually rather enjoying and entertaining. And it is the type of movie that you can watch over and over again. The story is fast paced and very simple to follow.There are some interesting acting performers on the cast list for ""Snakes on a Plane"", which includes Samuel L. Jackson, Julianna Margulies, Lin Shaye and Kenan Thompson.I have seen ""Snakes on a Plane"" about four or five times now since it was initially released back in 2006, and I still find it enjoyable to watch for what it is. Don't expect a grand masterpiece in cinematic history here, just take it for what it is; a campy movie with, as the title says, snakes on a plane!""Snakes on a Plane"" is also the movie that has one of the most memorable and used of Samuel L. Jackson lines it in. Given the profanity, then I will not mention it here, but I am sure that you already know which line I am hinting at here.",Snakes on a Plane
13,Quinoa1984,"like any other line of product, you get what you pay for, more or less",7,23 August 2006,"Snakes on a Plane has been written and written about online, with the ""buzz"" forming around not just the idea of such a B-movie conceit of the title explaining the whole crux of the horror and suspense of the picture, but Samuel L. Jackson's part in it. Maybe, however, such hype almost can come back to bite, no pun intended, on the audience at large. Maybe that's why I didn't find Snakes on a Plane tremendously successful, because as with any product that's more of that, unpretentiously so, than art, I just went in without expecting too much. David R. Ellis, the director, does after some build-up in the first half hour that's a little too typical (after all, a lot of these passengers aren't the plane shouldn't really be considered characters so much as snake bait with very predictable caricatures), finally make good on the promise of the title. These scenes in the main chunk of the picture, where we get both live and CGI snakes, of many shapes and sizes (I had a good laugh when the 22-foot long Python did his/her work), is very entertaining to the extent it serves. This is basically the best part to turn off your mind in B-movie fashion and just let the expected/un-expected bits do their work.But then there is, as mentioned, a little of a drawback to such a movie that is set-up for the camp crowd like a bubble-gum pop-star would be set-up for MTV. Too many months now, for example, I've known of the much anticipated use of the mother-f-er line in the film by Jackson, and when it does finally come up in the movie it's almost anti-climactic (and, in all honesty, the only time I've found the actor's usage of that certain big-gun curse word is in Pulp Fiction). His work in the movie is very dependable with the rest of the ensemble, as almost every convention or cliché with characters &/or scenes of this type are filled in by mostly professionals; one or two do get annoying (Keenan Thompson anyone?) So, at the end of Snakes on a Plane, hearing a hip-hop theme song put to it over the end credits, after seeing multiple counts of (creative) deaths and other mayhem, plus a level of logic that's barely countered by a snake expert character, I had my fun. It's not a great B-movie, but it should make the rounds of becoming 'cult' level even as it's already meant to be so by the filmmakers- almost blatantly so.",Snakes on a Plane

Jackson and Phillips take off; in flight, stewardesses Julianna Margulies (as Claire) and Sunny Mabrey (Tiffany) get hot for them. Some stereotypical-type passengers are along for the ride. They are all surprised, on the plane, by hundreds of stowaway snakes. The snakes are poisonous, ""hyper-aggressive"", and extremely nippy - and, they demonstrate an early preference for human sex organs. Yikes! ""Snakes on a Plane"" is imaginatively titled, at least. Unfortunately, it's not as successful as something like Ron Underwood's ""Tremors"". And, there is no performance like Shelley Winters' in ""The Poseidon Adventure"". The rampaging snakes simply aren't very interesting. Some of them are cute. There is excitement, and a little humor. The music, especially the opening and closing songs, is cool.This would be a great movie to see in flight, on a plane (as I am tired of seeing movies about cute bees).**** Snakes on a Plane (2006) David R.

15,Coventry,Awesome fun  on a Plane!,8,13 September 2006,"Despite the totally ridiculous title - which pretty much summarizes the entire movie  and the shameless presentation of literally every single cliché and stereotype in the horror movie business, ""Snakes on a Plane"" actually is a pretty unique film. Why? Because it finally is a summer blockbuster that completely lives up to its (internet) hype and exactly delivers what you expect from it! Plenty of fast action, a handful of scary jump-moments, beautiful empty-headed girls all around and an undeniably cool Hollywood star who constantly fires off catchy one-liners. That's what it looks like from all the trailers and internet marketing campaigns and that's also what you get. It's a good old homage to monstrous B-movies, similar to ""Tremors"" and maybe even ""Eight Legged Freaks"", only this film entirely owes its success to the wildly enthusiast internet fans that already worshiped the idea long before they even began shooting the actual movie. The script of ""Snakes on a Plane"" isn't all laughs and stupidity, mind you. There's a reason why the poor passengers of this red-eye flight are attacked by a seemly endless amount of aggressive snakes and several sequences contain suspense as well as visual flair. The different species of snakes are fascinating to behold and even the computer-engineered ones come across as convincing and not at all over the top... Except for one snake in particular, but at least that critter supplies the movie with an adorably grotesque cheese moment. Some of the snake-attacks and killings are remarkably gruesome and the acting performances are overall satisfying. David R. Ellis' directing is solid and he frequently proves that ""Snakes on a Plane"" is more than just a rapidly created fan boy horror movie. It's a cool and immensely entertaining throwback to good old B-movie times. Highly recommended.",Snakes on a Plane

Everyone from B/Z movie fans to worshipper's of Samuel L Jackson were anticipating its release based purely on its title, oh and the odd flash of Sammy Jackson proclaiming it's just a film about ""Snakes On A Mutha Fecking Plane"" obviously whetted the appetite .But is it any good? Well I viewed it for the first time last night, I actively avoid any film for a good while that relies on a marketing campaign such as the one that drove this film on, so now was the time to view it long after the dust has settled. I was pleasantly surprised by what I found. As someone who flies by aeroplane every month I identified straight away with the heavy white knuckle factor and the perfect array of annoying characters on board this particular flight. It helped me that I'm a lover of B movies and sci-fi schlock from way back when, and I too can claim to be one of the worshippers of Shouty Sammy Jackson, but chiefly I found myself laughing pretty much non stop from the moment the snakes arrived to the credit roll that was accompanied by a suitably cheese on toast song.If you are viewing this for the first time then surely you know what you are in for, it has faults for sure, I mean it was rewritten several times to pander to fan-boy requirements, and as good as Snakeovision is here, the CGI snakes lose their impact by the final third.

That's right someone somewhere thought it'd be a great idea to include sex , violence and bad language which means it was granted an 18 certificate . I imagine that plenty of 11 year olds had fallen in love with this movie simply down to the title and felt gut-wrenching disappointment when they realised they were unable to see it in the cinema Even worse because it can be classed as an adult movie anyone over 18 will have developed critical attitudes where they notice some ridiculous plot holes . For example the mafia want to bump off an FBI informant who's due to testify to a grand jury . The mafia hit upon a bright idea to smuggle hundreds of deadly snakes concealed in a box onto a plane and have the snakes escape when a detonator destroys the box . Is there anyone who didn't pick up on this stupid and contrived idea ? Why not just stick a bomb to the detonator thereby ensuring the witness is killed for certain . There's other niggling problems such as no matter how posionous a snake's venom is you'd not die instantly as seen here . On top of that many of the snakes are totally unconvincing and look like what they are - CGI FX Maybe I'm being too harsh since this is a film that shouldn't be taken too seriously . In many ways it feels like a follow on from the AIRPORT franchise of the 1970s and you do keep expecting George Kennedy to make an appearance at some point . But when all is said and done this is a film that's too dumb for reasoning adults and the producers have only themselves to blame for its disappointing box office returns",Snakes on a Plane
20,Scarecrow-88,Snakes on a Plane,7,17 January 2009,"A surfer stumbles upon a murder at the hands of notorious gangster Eddie Kim and must be protected by FBI agent Samuel L Jackson on board a flight equipped with an army of deadly poisonous snakes, planted there to kill him so that he couldn't testify. Somehow Jackson and the flight attendants must find the means to keep those on board safe and kill the snakes that are threatening their lives, not to mention another unfortunate dilemma facing them..both pilots are bitten by snakes and someone else will have to land the plane! A disaster movie with CGI snakes that attack a bunch of folks on board a plane with Sammy L working his usual cool/charisma. You are most certainly confident that he'll find a way to save as many as possible.The snakes bite into a breast nipple, eyeball, penis, throats, buttock, faces, leaving some nasty after-effects such as sores and mouth-foaming. A dog and man are victims of a massive python which wraps around and chokes them before the feeding occurs(..the dog's fate isn't elaborated, although the film shows the python swallowing the male victim's head!) Fun supporting cast add color to the proceedings. Like in a lot of disaster films, we are introduced to the supporting characters before the perilous situation takes place with the release of the snakes which are ultimately antagonized by the pheromones of leis flowers. Featuring characters that mimic cultural archetypes such as Rachel Blanchard as a Paris Hilton wannabe with a dog, IPOD, and Valley Girl looks(..her name is Mercedes)and rap star Three G's(Flex Alexander)who is a cocky germaphobe with attitude. Lin Shaye has a wonderful role as flight attendant on her last tour, Grace(..one knows her fate when she mentions how she plans to retire after this one last flight). Julianna Margulies is flight attendant Claire, who plans to become a lawyer after this last flight, and is called upon to help Sammy L's agent Neville Flynn, when the going gets rough. Kenan Thompson lends his usual funny expressions to the character of Troy, Three G's entourage and high school chum who looks out for him and is asked to land the plane based solely on his video-game expertise! The computer generated snakes aren't always that convincing, although that's part of the movie's charm. Fast-paced thrill-ride that aims to please. The absurd premise just draws you in and it's up to the filmmakers to sell such an idea as passengers joining together to find a way out of such a difficult situation through a variety of ways..you must take a leap of faith when you see Sammy L killing snakes with a taser gun!",Snakes on a Plane
21,preppy-3,Really mixed feelings on this one,7,26 August 2006,"Samuel L. Jackson is flying a witness to a brutal killing from Hawaii to Los Angeles to testify. The person guilty for it doesn't want him to live so he packs the plane full of deadly snakes to kill him...and hundreds of innocent passengers.The plot is stupid from the word 'go'--like HOW did he get all those snakes on board in cases without security noticing? All the clichés are in place too with all the stock characters--there's the horny young couple; the obnoxious white old guy; the innocent ditzy rich girl (with a little dog named Ashley Kate no less!); the two kids who have never been on a plane; the honeymooning couple etc etc. All that's missing is Helen Reddy as a signing nun! These characters are introduced in all seriousness too---not in a remotely funny way.Then, after the snakes attack, ever single disaster in an ""Airport"" movie you've ever seen is thrown in. Again--in all seriousness. Maybe that's supposed to be the joke but I wasn't laughing. The audience I had was dead silent too. The only parts that worked were the VERY vicious and gory snake attacks---they're graphic and bloody and pretty disturbing. Some very sympathetic characters are killed also.The acting--well how good could it be? Everybody keeps a straight face and says their lines--that's about it. I've heard that this works if you have an audience rearing to go and yell back things at the screen...like ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"". BUT (like ""Rocky"") it doesn't work that well as a straight movie without the audience. It plays like an R rated ""Airport"" movie with gore thrown in. I didn't hate it--but I wasn't thrilled. I give it a 7 for Jackson (he's NEVER bad) and the attacks.",Snakes on a Plane

23,poolandrews,Superbly entertaining tongue-in-cheek thriller.,7,18 January 2009,"Snakes on a Plane starts in Honolulu in Hawaii where Sean Jones (Nathan Philips) sees Los Angeles prosecutor Daniel Hayes (Scott Nicholson) brutally murdered by vicious mobster Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson), as a witness Sean has to be killed & silenced by Kim. FBI agent Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) gets to Sean before Kim though & persuades him to testify against the mobster at a trial in the US. Flynn is assigned to escort Sean to Los Angeles via flight 121, a passenger flight from Honolulu to Los Angeles. They board the flight & take-off, all seems to be going well when 450 poisonous snakes smuggled aboard are released in the luggage hold & begin to slither their way all over the plane. With added pheromones sprayed everywhere that makes the snakes go crazy they attack everyone in sight. Trapped thousands of feet in the air on a plane full of killer snakes the remaining passengers have a hard time staying alive...Directed by David R. Ellis this somewhat infamous film seems to divide opinion, on the one side you have those who think it's ridiculous & silly & those like me who think that Snakes on a Plane is just so gloriously entertaining in all it's silliness. It's fairly well documented that the concept for Snakes on a Plane came from a late night booze session between Hollywood writers who challenged each other to see who could come up with the worst pitch for a film, out of humble beginnings it is said Snakes on a Plane was born as New Line Cinema actually then decided to make the thing. God bless 'em. Snakes on a Plane is definitely a B-Movie with A-Movie production values, this feels like the sort of thing that would turn up on the Sci-Fi Channel with a few has-been TV stars & awful CGI effects but the added Hollywood polish turns this into a really enjoyable way to pass an hour & three quarters of anyones time. The script & film as a whole certainly doesn't take itself too seriously & has it's tongue-in-cheek for the majority of the running time, from snakes biting a woman's naked breast to one biting a guy's penis while he has a pee to the often quoted line by Samuel L. Jackson towards the end. Some of it can get a little silly for it's own good especially at the end when the comedy relief fat black guy helps land the jet after saying he can because he plays lots of Playstation flight simulators! The pace is good, the character's are alright & while you won't care about any of them they are likable enough & I rather liked it overall, sure it won't change your life, it has no deep underlying message about social or moral values & it's not going to make you think but it is undeniably entertaining & surely that's why we all watch films, to be entertained & it's as simple & straight forward as that.A sort of mixture of those transportation disaster films of the 70's & a creature feature Snakes on a Plane actually has some quite suspenseful scenes & director Ellis manages to create a fair amount of tension during the attack scenes & the ensuing panic. There are lots of nice little visual gags too like the the 'snake' preset button on a microwave, a funny airline safety demonstration & along with the oxygen masks dropping down so do the snakes from the same compartments. There's a bit of gore & exploitation here that was filmed during re-shoots after New Line Cinema decided to upgrade the PG-13 to an R, there's a sex scene with some nudity, various bites, some blood splatter, a guy is trampled by a panicking woman who sticks her high heel into his head, a snake explodes in a microwave & someone is beaten with a baseball bat. The CGI computer effects are actually quite impressive & maybe slightly better than the film deserves but I ain't complaining. Keep watching the end credits as there's a funny specially shot music video which samples Samuel L. Jackson's infamous line of dialogue & features a lot of the main cast.With a supposed budget of about $33,000,000 & largely shot in Vancouver in Canada & has good production values throughout. The cast was probably chosen for their looks rather then their acting ability although it's all played in a knowingly fun way, Samuel L. Jackson is always watchable & there's a few good lookers here as well.Snakes on a Plane is a tremendously entertaining tongue-in-cheek horror thriller that I for one enjoyed immensely, so shoot me. Look, Snakes on a Plane is fun & entertains & that's all I really want from a film to be honest. I would sooner watch Snakes on a Plane than any of the recently announced BAFTA nominated films. If you really want to see a a rubbish film than watch the 'mockbuster' rip-off Snakes on a Train (2006) which really is painful to sit through.",Snakes on a Plane
24,dbborroughs,Bad special effects and a way too knowing attitude ruin what should have been a fun flight to disaster,4,24 August 2006,"Spoilers AheadBad.why'd have to be bad?Since Indiana Jones wouldn't take the job they got Samuel L Jackson to do it. And he does it quite well in possibly the only real performance in the entire movie.Okay you know the story: Jackson is taking a witness to a murder from Hawaii to Los Angeles, however the king pin doesn't want the witness to arrive alive so he fills the plane with snakes which come out half way into the flight, the idea being that the plane goes down and no one is the wiser.Pre-sold, ultra-hyped and thought to be a shoe in as a so ""bad its good"" classic this movie had many people, myself included dying to see it.Yea, well I've seen it and I really wish I hadn't. Clearly made by a committee, this movie is a mess, some of it intentional. The idea was to make throw back to the schlocky 1970's horror movies that played in the drive ins. The problem is that while they got a great deal of it right, at least on paper, they messed up in execution. The story is classic exploitation. That they got right. However they messed up in the way things happen. The snake attacks for example happen in a check list sort of way. Bite naked breast? Check. Bite guy urinating? Check? Giant Snake tries to swallow man? Check. Its all done as if down a list, and since the list takes priority (since that's what people want to see) the rest of the movie becomes a confused mess as the filmmakers try to get the survivors to the next snake attack opportunity. None of it is logical, its just what ever seemed like a good idea at the time to link the ""wow"" moments. Actually I think the best way to describe it all as a series of punchlines with no set up.The performances are, outside of Jackson either merely adequate or way too knowing. The problem with the movie is this sense of knowing. The films in the 70's were played straight and that's where the charm was. Here the actors and the director let you know that they know you know this is ridiculous and the result is film that borders dangerously on parody. With movies like this you have to either go one way or the other not both. The best way is to go straight and let the audience sort it out.The special effects aren't, what's worse in order to be charming the film intentionally goes for the rubber snakes. It also goes for heavily CGI snakes none of which look even remotely in the film with the actors. Its clear a good portion of the snakes are in that cartoon never-land that is poor special effects. (when will people learn the reason old special effects tended to work was that we knew on some level these things were there, in some form, with the actors, not completely added later)This movie is hugely disappointing. It's just a bad movie with some clever bits.Wait for cable.",Snakes on a Plane

29,view_and_review,Don't judge a book by its cover,5,10 January 2007,"The critics ripped this movie to shreds before even the first screening. This fell under the classic ""judging a book by its cover"" cliché just by its title and synopsis. So, needless to say, I was somewhat biased before watching the movie. Well, one thing I found out: it wasn't half as bad as most of the critics said it was. It wasn't by any means a great movie, but it was bearable. I was put off by the concept, the weak plot, and some of the predictability, but there was just enough action and suspense to keep me watching. And I must admit, I was waiting for a classic Samuel L. Jackson profanity laden tirade. Nobody is better at giving loud profanity rich speeches than Samuel L.I'm not a big fan of blood and gore, and a few times this movie went the shock and awe and make you cringe route with the way people were being killed, both by the snakes and by other means. ***SPOILER*** I mean who gets killed by being stepped on in the ear by a woman with stilettos on?? ***END SPOILER*** This was an average movie, or even slightly above average... heck, I may even watch it again.",Snakes on a Plane

The opening sequence setting up the purpose of both the snakes and the plane was well handled (if not particularly original), and the rest of the movie was engaging.It must be admitted that the basic premise is daft, but if you're not overly critical (and it says here in my resume that I'm not overly critical), then the movie represents a good time. In fact, it's a bit of a hoot.And there are times in an action movie when a moment can successfully be played so outrageously that you burst out laughing, and it doesn't mar the underling drama (the balloon rescue at the end of Waterworld comes to mind). Snakes on a Plane is loaded with these.So go in without your expectations running too high, be prepared (as usual) to tune out the customary unnecessary profanity (unless you are one of those MFs who actually enjoys every MF in a MF movie to MFing curse all the MFing time), and you'll have fun.",Snakes on a Plane
31,ferguson-6,The First Thing I Told You,2,21 August 2006,"Greetings again from the darkness. What a disappointment the film is. Was I expecting ""Raging Bull"" or ""Citizen Kane""? Of course not. But I was expecting some humorous lines and wild, camp creature scenes straight out of the 60's horror fests. Instead I got a lame CGI snake-cam that wasn't funny or scary and barely passes as any form of entertainment.The hodgepodge of scenes are so poorly edited and assembled, that one gets the feeling the film was finalized to meet the release date rather than to create a film. The great Samuel L. Jackson does what he can to play his part straight and over the top. For this to actually work, he needed some better lines. Many that probably looked sharp on paper fall flatter than the ridiculous snake attack scenes.Director David R. Ellis is a long time Hollywood stuntman and has given us two miserable films in the last few years ... ""Final Destination 2"" and ""Cellular"". ""Snakes"" becomes the hat trick in what we can only hope will be a short directorial career.The rest of the cast is mostly made up of who-the-hell-cares types. The exceptions are Julianna Marguiles, Kenan Thompson, David Koechner, Bobby Cannavale and Todd Louiso. All of these have too few lines and too little screen time.Snake bites to all body parts, a ridiculous-but-not-funny story line, lousy action and bad CGI make for a bad, not funny film. Jackson's best line is an add-on through a re-shoot and it looks miserably out of place in the moment. A few other obvious re-shoots are included, but nothing that saves the film.

Jackson is assigned to transport a murder witness to the U.S. Unfortunately the plane is infested by poisonous snakes courtesy of the murderer. Credit must be given to slick advertizing for admitting just how bad this film really is since the screenplay is clearly a bigger disaster than that of the plot problem. Director David R. Ellis has fun with the variety of methods for which a snake can strike and where. These creatures should have been present when he made the dreadful Homeward Bound 2. To a large degree this film is well made but horribly wrong on many levels particularly its yearning for cult movie status, which is doesn't deserve. Jackson's job is to have several outbursts containing colourful four letter vocabulary. Julianna Margulies plays a flight attendant on her last night of work and she ends up trying to calm down panic stricken passengers. The rest of the characters are victims who are bitten by snakes in one method or another and we are expected to laugh at its lunacy. In comparison, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is every bit as numbing yet it creates humour by taking pot shots at something healthy, such as vegetables.

More than anything, this one gets plenty of fun out of the sheer cheesiness and fun of its premise, which is given such a ridiculous turn that it becomes highly entertaining how it goes through its paces. The concept of the film, letting venomous snakes loose inside a crowded commercial jet, is a pretty goofy and silly premise and this one certainly plays that to its advantage here in giving the snakes quite free-reign crawling through the plan as there are some big scenes here. The opening scenes of them escaping the cargo hold and slithering among the feet of the oblivious passengers who are going about their business is highly chilling, as are the early attacks here on the couple in the bathroom or the guy on the toiler which come off so well here for utilizing such a concept. That means the main section of the film is reserved for the grand attacks on the passengers and there's just tons of fun to come from this kind of high-energy action with the snakes swarming down on the people from the emergency systems, leaping into the aisles to strike and generally just attacking the panicked crowd of fleeing passengers through the plane snapping and striking them all over the place, generating quite a fine highlight sequence here with the snake mayhem being quite impressive with all kind of nasty snake bites, including both a woman's and guy's private areas getting it, a snake burying itself in an eyeball, mangled up corpses, gruesome snake bites on just about every body-part, some blood-inducing series, a snake gobbling some guy's head and a high heel stuck in one's neck. That this is done in conjunction with the growing list of disasters that creep up due to their antics that not only potentially doom the flight while still struggling with the snakes breaking through their barricades provides for some fun times. These here make this one quite fun and able to hold off the one real flaw to the film. Despite the fine central premise here, the way this one goes about attempting to explain why the creatures behave this way is insanely stupid and highly illogical, taking far too many circumstances and contrivances in order to cause it to carry out the way it does so afterwhile, the explanations just become laughable. This cheesiness might be too much for some to take here, as the central concept is quite goofy and silly enough to really be somewhat detrimental in the end. As well as some dodgy CGI, these here are what lower this one overall.Rated R: Graphic Language, Violence, Nudity and a mild sex scene.",Snakes on a Plane

35,The_Void,Samuel L. Jackson and CGI snakes on a cliché-ridden plane,6,23 January 2007,"Well, you can't go into a film called 'Snakes on a Plane' expecting anything other than a fast paced fun romp, and while the film isn't quite as exciting as I'd have liked it to be, it has to be said that it pretty much delivers on it's promise. The film harks back to the B-movie features that were so popular back in the eighties, and that is respectable; although modern influences and a need to make the film appeal to a younger audience ensure that Snakes on a Plane isn't as effective as it could have been. Obviously, a film with a plot line as thin as this one needs a whole lot of filling out; and this is done through the passengers on the plane, which are all clichéd and paper thin...but hey, we're here for the snakes. The film begins with a murder being committed by a vicious gangster named Eddie Kim. The murder has a witness, and of course the police plan to protect him so that he can testify. Copper Neville Flynn boards a plane going to LAX with this witness and everything seems to be going well until it turns out that Kim has hatched a plan to bring the plane down. No, it's not a bomb - he's filled the plane with poisonous snakes! The only 'name' actor in the film is Samuel L. Jackson, and as you would expect; he's the centre of attention at all times. Jackson is a definite asset to the film, and it has to be said that if he wasn't on board; Snakes on a Plane wouldn't have been nearly as much fun. The snakes are mostly, if not all CGI, and for me this really ruined the effect as the way they move in this film doesn't really seem threatening because it's so overdone, and the film doesn't even implement them very well as aside from one scene that sees a man constricted by a giant snake, the snakes mostly just bite. I'm guessing that the snakes in this film don't reflect those in real life, as while I'm not an expert on snakes, I highly doubt that this sort of situation is even possible, pheromones or not. Of course, you have to suspend your disbelief while watching a film like this...but in my opinion, the film doesn't give the audience quite enough distraction from analysing the actual situation. However, I suppose it's a good thing that a film as silly as this was able to be made as it gives me hope that more silly and over the top ideas will be given cinematic treatment, and eventually we might be blessed with a good one. Undemanding film fans will certainly enjoy this; but it's merely OK if you ask me.",Snakes on a Plane
36,zetes,A disappointment coming after Cellular,4,6 July 2008,"I finally got around to seeing this film, which everyone was talking about months before its release, but which everyone avoided like the plague when it actually opened. Really, the title is all you have to know about the movie. Take that, and the fact that it stars Samuel L. Jackson, and you can basically imagine an amusing scenario in your head. Unfortunately, a feature length movie has to last a certain amount of time (although, I should point out, one doesn't have to last 107 minutes, which is how long this one does). The concept grows old pretty quick, especially when the titular villains are created with poor CGI 90% of the time. Jackson seems pretty lifeless, which is surprising considering how happy he seemed while promoting it. While I can't say I was too shocked this was so poor, I was holding out some hope. David R. Ellis' previous film, Cellular, was ingenious in how it spun such a fun movie out of such a stupid gimmick. I was hoping he could do the same for Snakes on a Plane.",Snakes on a Plane
37,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Snakes on a Plane,9,23 August 2006,"For the record, I hate snakes, and have this phobia of snakes. I can even freeze in my tracks at a bloody picture. And it goes without saying that the Snake House is never a place I'll visit in any zoo. What's my fear about? I don't know, just that I attach this sense of evilness and danger to these slimy (yes I know they're not) slithery creatures that should be condemned to the depths of hell.Anyway I digress. What compelled me to watch this picture, besides the fact that I'm a sucker for punishment, is Samuel L Jackson. He's THE man! With Sam, you'll always know he'll lift that scene or two, oozing street charisma and attitude like none other. This is a cheesy movie done in a cheesy way but with A list production values, tons of special effects, animal trainers, and yes, plenty of snakes of all shapes and sizes. From pythons to the cobras to the rattlers, I tell you these creatures will chill you at your seats. Thank goodness this ain't on no IMAX or 3D effect, otherwise I suspect many will be reeling their heads backwards, and backwards some more.The plot's none too cerebral to begin with, so don't bother but accept, go on board, and enjoy the fright, I mean flight. It isn't going all out to scare you, though watching characterless caricatures suffer and die under the most sickening conditions involving all conceivable snake-accessible orifices and sexual appendages, provides some sort of sick pleasure. The usual clichés of thrillers/horrors are milked here as well, like the well used one that those who have sex are usually the first to go.And there are plenty of victims from where that came from, given the movie's set on a red eye flight in a Boeing jet, offering a variety of passengers like the rap star and his posse, kids travelling alone for the first time, dumb blondes, the Asian Kung Fu master, and even the cabin crew, who are put in a better light as compared to another set-on-a-plane movie Flightplan.If there should be a gripe, then it's the length of the action sequences, most of which are just too short, or unexplained, especially those involving Jackson. I mean, the audience should see how he goes around killing those SOBs, but as mentioned, we don't get to see much. I suspect some scenes will probably end up in an extended DVD version, deleted scenes, or perhaps make their way into video games, fighting his way through with makeshift weapons.That aside, and if you're OK with the censored bit in this NC-16 movie where a couple joins the mile high club (too bad it's forcibly shortened), Snakes on a Plane is a movie to catch on the big screen for the fun factor, and no, you'll definitely not get to watch this on any inflight entertainment system anytime soon.The Cobra Starship music video for the movie plays through the end credits. Not too bad a song, think it's becoming a ear worm for me.",Snakes on a Plane
38,Smells_Like_Cheese,I can't believe it! This movie was so entertaining!,8,2 January 2007,"I remember laughing at my mom because she and my sister came home and told me about the trailer of ""Snakes on a Plane"", I was like ""Who the heck would name a movie 'Snakes on a Plane'?"". But they did! I was laughing even more to see Samuel L. Jackson in this movie, I thought for a minute that he had lost his mind, being such an amazing actor, was his career that desperate? The trailer just made this movie look sillier and sillier, I just couldn't believe a movie like this was being made, but my mom and I rented it today for fun and we actually had a blast watching it! After witnessing a mafia murder, the man has to travel to LA from Honalulu with an FBI agent. However, the mafia leader decides to destroy the witness on the plane before he and the other passengers land by planting hundreds of poisoness snakes in the flowers on the plane! When the snakes break free, they have a party going on! They are attacking all the passengers in the coolest deaths ever! And now the FBI agent along with the other passengers must try to land this snake pit before all the passengers die of snake poison.Snakes on a Plane is sheer entertainment and nothing more, as unrealistic as the situations are, you have to admit that it was just a blast watching this film! The deaths were just so awesome, I think my favorite was the man going to the bathroom and well... you have just got to see it! I would highly recommend Snakes on a Plane for fun! It was an awesome entertaining movie with cool effects and chilling scares, you won't be disappointed! 8/10",Snakes on a Plane
39,OllieSuave-007,"Cheesy, but somewhat of a thrill.",6,7 April 2014,"This is a cheesy action thriller where an FBI agent finds himself and hundreds of civilians on a plane full of deadly snakes, released by the mob to kill a witness being flown from Honolulu to Los Angeles.As with many movies set on an airplane, there is little room for fillers and plenty for non-stop action and thrills, and that's what you'll find in this flick. The plot is simple and quick-paced, followed by some chilling action as the many snakes of all sorts make their way out of their cages, slithering to every nook and corner in the plane and making their way to the unsuspecting passengers, sending them in a frenzy and creating total chaos. There are also plenty of graphic scenes as well, especially in the parts where the passengers trample over each other as they escape the snakes.It can be a fun movie, but it is overshadowed by the cheesy acting and CGI effects. The obvious and direct title of the movie gave me the impression that this was going to be one campy flick. Some of the acting and effects are so bad you could laugh at times.

40,sddavis63,It's Sort Of A Serpentine Version of Airport,3,26 December 2013,"Let's state the obvious right off the top - this movie really isn't meant to be taken seriously. No movie entitled ""Snakes On A Plane"" is meant to be taken seriously. And, really, not for a moment do you take this seriously. It reminded me a little bit of ""Airport"" - lots of characters, all with their own story lines. Basically, though, it revolves around Sean (Nathan Phillips) and FBI agent Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson.) Yes - part of the strangeness of this film is that a character named Neville Flynn really doesn't fir Samuel L. Jackson. Sean witnesses a murder in Hawaii, and then Flynn is escorting him to Los Angeles so he can testify against the mob boss responsible. The mob boss, of course, manages to get these extremely venomous snakes on to the plane to wreak havoc, and presumably to take out Sean before the trial.It's unbelievable. Truly unbelievable. Right from the start. How did the mob boss track Sean down so quickly. It really didn't look as if anyone got a good look at him. His first encounter with Flynn - well, exciting. But also kind of unbelievable. And the action on the plane? For a while it's exciting, but frankly after a while the point is made - the plane is full of poisonous snakes that are going after everyone on board. So you more or less see the same things happening over and over again - although the nipple bite and the penis bite in the lavatories are enough to call forth a chuckle.Of course, in the midst of it all, the pilot and co-pilot both go down, and landing this huge jumbo jet falls into the lap of a young man with 2000 hours of flying experience - on a video game flight simulator. Uh. Yeah. Whatever.Everything about this - including most of the performances - is a bit over the top to say the least. There are times when it's exciting - for a while - but because it has such a limited story (really, how much can you do with snakes on a plane) and because most of the dilemmas being faced were dealt with more than 40 years ago with ""Airport"" it really can't sustain that excitement, and I actually started to find it a bit dull after the first hour or so (and maybe even before that.)

41,thesar-2,Motherfucking!,5,29 December 2013,"I honestly think the movie, Snakes on a Plane, was literally based around the line: ""Enough is enough! I have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!"" by Sam Jackson. They thought, probably in a pot-induced night, of Sam saying that and wrote the script around it.Either way, it worked. The marketing, the advertising, the repeat, um, businessthe line and the movie worked. Okay, to be honest, the line worked more than the movie.I always appreciate a movie, specifically a B-movie, that never takes itself too seriously and knows/shows exactly what it is. In this case, and of course: Sharknado, the title says it all. But, despite the premise and obvious B-movie fare here, the movie does tend to take itself just a tiny bit seriously and the pacing and length is way off.What starts off as a stereotypical action no-brainer, albeit fun film, the movie wastes a tremendous amount of screen-time on the no-name passengers on the plane. So much so, one gets enormously impatient for said snakes to invade the title plane. I was.But, the goods pay off and when the carnage starts, it's unapologetic in its B-Movie mindset.A witness to a murder from a very bad, bad man lands civilian Sean on a plane with Neville, a FBI agent. In order for him not to testify, and boy this is NO SPOILER: snakes are on the plane to bring it down. Deadly, aggressive and penis-chomping ones.Going into this movie to hate on it is like a Duck Dynasty fan getting offended after watching Brokeback Mountain. You gotta know what you're getting into and if you like Sam Jackson, even a tiny, tiny bit, you're gonna love him here. I did.* * * Final thoughts: I haven't seen this since it debuted in 2006. While I did like it, but not love it, I thought it did exactly what it set out to and so, I admired it for that. Not that I was ever planning to see it again, I did have to revisit it once I saw countless Sam Jackson memes this Christmas (2013) season that playfully and hilariously used his line after 7 years. I just had to see this again and even though I had the same reaction now as I did back in the mid-2000s, I wasn't displeased I did take this flight once more.",Snakes on a Plane

Jackson, is ordered by his boss back in L.A to get Sean back safely to the states to be a witness against Kim in his upcoming murder extortion and racketeering trial. Commandeering a flight to L.A the FBI has Sean put on board with the agency's usual air-tight security. What Agent Flynn and the FBI doesn't realize is how desperate and determined Kim is to knock off the agency's star witness against him. Even if Kim has to take down the plane and its entire crew and passengers in order to do it!Slithering terror at 30,000 feet above the vast Pacific Ocean as a brood of some 500 poisonous vipers cobras and rattlers are let loose on some 200 unsuspecting passengers and crew-members of flight 121 from Honolulu to L.A. This ghastly and dastardly act was accomplished by that murderous sleaze-ball Kim with the help of illegal black-market poisonous snake smuggler Kraitler, Darron Moore. Kim's gang got the deadly serpents on the plane in wooden crates who, by the snakes being old blooded, weren't picked up by the heat sensors at the airport terminal. The snakes, hopped up with pheromones, breaking out of the baggage compartment section of the plane go on a deadly rampage attacking anyone or anything that moves even the pet dogs and cats of the terrified passengers. In what turns out to be a race against time Agent Flynn and one of rock stars Three G's, Flex Alexander, bodyguards Troy, Kenan Thompson, attempt to land the plane at L.A Airport. That's before everyone on it ends up either dead from snake bites or is sucked out of the fuselage with one of the planes windows blown out. Back on the ground everything is being done to get the scores of different antidotes for the two dozen or so species of poisonous snakes, and snake bites, who attacked the plane passengers to save them from going into convulsions an dying.Could well have been called Airport 06' ""Snakes on a Plane"" is one of the better disasters movies coming out of Hollywood in the last few years just because it didn't at all, in spite of the seriousness of the story, take itself seriously. Samuel L. Jackson did his usual kick and bad ass act as Agent Flynn a man with both nerves and balls of steel. Flynn seemed to be immune to the snakes and their fangs as if he was wearing protective clothing not getting sung once despite him slugging it out with the vipers for almost an hour on the plane. A good half of the people on board weren't as lucky as Agent Flynn getting stung and in one case crushed to death as well as swallowed whole by a 25 foot non-poisonous constrictor.Some of the most terrifying scenes in the movie happened in the plane's restrooms with a horny couple getting attacked and killed by the snakes who caught them in the most intimate of circumstances and positions. there's also the poor man who was about to relive himself who has a viper attack him and grab him by his private parts as he slowly, due to the snake bite, lost consciousness and died.***SPOILER ALERT*** One the most touching and courageous scenes in the movie has to do with senior, or head, stewardess Grace, Lin Shayn, who passed up an early retirement offer in order to take flight 121 back home to L.A. By doing that Grace unknowingly ended up becoming one of the hero's, together with Agent Flynn, on board by saving an infant from getting stung to death by a hoard of deadly vipers but at the cost of her own life.",Snakes on a Plane

44,Robert_duder,I saw it for exactly what they meant for it to be...BRAVO!!,9,4 February 2007,"I waited a long time to see Snakes On A Plane. There was so much press about it and how it was going to be this corny, ""so bad that it's good"" film and Samuel L. Jackson was pumped about it and it was going to be the cult favorite of the year and on and on and then in the Theaters it bombed and bombed hard. Where were the cult fans then?? So I finally sat down with it and I realized where all the hype went. They were wrong!! This wasn't corny, or so bad it was good...this was just a downright awesome, kick ass action/horror movie and I loved it!! That's not to see some of the special effects and the idea being it weren't cheesy but they gave it a story, an interesting story, a premise, a hero and lots and lots of random victims all being bitten in terrifying ways thousands of feet in the air. Best of all is smooth as silk and tough as a crocodile's skin Samuel L. Jackson locking horns with the slithering beasts. This guy is just good in everything and taking on Snakes is no different.Jackson plays F.B.I. escort Neville Flynn who must take a witness to L.A. to testify against a notorious mob boss who they are finally ready to take down. This role for Jackson is less acting and just more kicking some snake ass, looking jacked up enough to shoot some things and land a plane and throw out historical one liners. Jackson definitely ups the class and ante on this film and makes it on of his own classics. Julianna Margulies is the romantic interest for Jackson...Sandra Bullock to his Keanu (Speed)...she is the calm, organized and determined flight attendant who tries to keep everyone safe. Her performance comes across to me as very ""movie of the week"" which is perhaps where most of her acting talent comes from but she never really impresses and her and Jackson don't interact enough to establish a romance. Her character could have been a nobody and it wouldn't have effected the movie one way or another. Nathan Phillips is the witness who inadvertently saw the mobster torture and kill a man and is now subject to torture on a plane full of snakes. Phillips is good and him and Jackson have good chemistry opposite each other but like the other roles Phillips isn't given a lot of screen time. Also joining the supporting cast is lovely Rachel Blanchard as a ""Paris Hilton"" type débutante, Flex Alexander as an infamous rap singer, and his buddies/body guards Kenan Thompson, and Keith Dallas. All of these actors and characters do well at being victims or scream queens/Kings, but when all is said and done this film is about two things and it doesn't try to be about any other two things...Snakes...on a place, and Samuel L. Jackson.Truly this is a Jackson vehicle but the thing is that it's good. It's entertaining, funny, sexy at times, horrifying, slithery, violent, bloody and just an all around great monster flick that puts you at the edge of your seat for an all around kick butt good time. Snakes On A Plane truly is worth seeing for anyone who loves a good thriller/monster movie and despite being shallow and not exactly an Academy Award Winning film...it doesn't try to be and it hits the mark for exactly what it wants to be. Director David Ellis has had some bad movies, and has had some good movies but he's just finding the right niche I think and he scored with this one. Perhaps we will be in for a series of bad sequels?? I'd be up for it. 9/10",Snakes on a Plane
45,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Not a classic, but not a film that's likely to be forgot either",4,31 December 2006,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A young surfer is the unfortunate witness of a vicious murder at the hands of a triad mobster. As well as meaning he's likely to be hunted down and killed next, it also means FBI agent Flynn (Samuel L Jackson) wants him to testify for the prosecution in an upcoming trial against the man. That means flying from Hawaii to Los Angeles. But the mobster has come up with an ingenious way to throw a spanner in the works on that- he's smuggled a few hundred killer snakes on board the plane. But Flynn refuses to sit back and be defeated and rallies the other passengers to unite together to come out of the situation alive.David R Ellis's action adventure film is something of a revolution in film-making standards, in that movie fans went online and helped to write the script with their own ideas and plot devices. And they seem to have gone for a film that throws a knowing wink to all the clichés of the genre: a preposterous story/plot developments, stereotypical characters (the middle aged guy who's always complaining, feuding kids, obnoxious characters including the sexed up lovers who need to get a room and the VIP guest with a huge entourage), iffy dialogue and less than Oscar worthy performances, but all done with a knowing flair and with it's tongue firmly in it's cheek. In other words, a film that requires no brain power at all. It's just never as much fun as it sounds, and could have been trimmed by about quarter of an hour so the idea didn't wear itself out. But it's unpretentious and unashamedly trashy, with a typically strong lead performance from Jackson and some (fairly) cool (but cheap looking) snake effects, so you might just get by. **",Snakes on a Plane
46,bowmanblue,The greatest film ever made,7,11 February 2019,"Okay, so 'Snakes on a Plane' may not - sadly - be recognised as 'the greatest film ever made' - I may have slightly exaggerated that one. However, it is a shining example of a film that tells you everything you need to know about it from four words alone. You probably don't even need to watch any form of trailer to know whether you're going to enjoy it or not. Therefore, if the prospect of a plane filled with poisonous snakes slithering after a load of hapless passengers then you really shouldn't even consider sitting down to watch it.However, if - like me - you sometimes feel like putting your brain 'on hold' for an hour and a half and want to watch something completely silly and completely implausible then you should definitely give it a go. If you need to know anything about 'the plot' then it centres around Samuel L Jackson playing an FBI agent (or basically playing Samuel L Jackson - he doesn't really put much extra effort into his performance, but - who cares - we all love him for what he does!) who has to transport a vital witness (via plane, of course) across America in order to get him to testify against some gangster or other. However, said bad-man decides the best way to stop this witness from ever fingering him in court would be to 'take down' the whole plane with a whole crate of poisonous snakes who will bite every last passenger.Now, if you're wondering how a film with such a simple premise can stretch itself out into over an hour and a half long, it can. Believe it or not, it does have a little more (and only a little!) depth than you may think. Yes, many of the snakes are CGI and yes, most of the victims' characters are hardly 'well-developed' during the story and it even succumbs to some typical horror cliches such as 'have sex and die,' but there's just something so damn enjoyable about this film that you can pretty much forgive every last minor gripe about it.As I said, Samuel L Jackson doesn't have to reach far to play this FBI agent - he's basically playing a cross between himself and the same character he plays in almost every other film he's in. But - most importantly - he seems to be having fun. And that's what shines through - not just with him, but in the whole film. It never tries to be anything other than a daft popcorn movie and it succeed completely. It's Jackson's baby through and through, as you probably won't remember a single other person on the flight once the credits have rolled. There is a woman from UK TV's 'Peep Show' and David Koechner is always worth a watch, but, apart from them, it's hardly an 'ensemble' cast.As I said, the title tells you everything you should need to know about the film. If you choose to watch it and you find you don't enjoy it, I'd be very surprised. It's worth it alone from Jackson's delivery of the now famous line, 'I have had it with those xxxxx snakes on this xxxx plane!' Classic.",Snakes on a Plane
47,MLDinTN,a guilty pleasure,9,27 August 2007,"This tongue in cheek movie turned out to be awesome. It was clearly played for laughs. It made it even better to have two well known actors in lead roles. Sam Jackson really made the film entertaining. It is one of the most entertaining films of 2006. Sure the snakes look really fake and the idea of someone being able to smuggle hundreds of deadly snakes on a plane as well as turn them vicious enough to attack humans left and right is ridiculous, but that is the point. It is supposed to sound completely absurd. There are 2 scenes that take place in the airplane restrooms that were 2 of the funniest scenes of all time. And instead of lucking out and having a passenger who is an ex F16 pilot to land the plane, we have an avid Playstation player.FINAL VERDICT: One of the most entertaining films to come out in a while.

50,CuriosityKilledShawn,More Zzzzz than Sssss,4,22 August 2006,"I was quite looking forward to this film as I enjoyed David R. Ellis' previous film Cellular and the poster and idea for Snakes on a Plane is just pure high-concept trash. I could have been great, but I was surprisingly bored through-out. I do like popcorn movies, but the popcorn has to taste good and this bucket just has far too much venom in it for me.After Final Destination 2 and Cellular, David R. Ellis seems to be New Line Cinema's king of B-movies. Since the departure of Ronny Yu from this project, he seemed like the most logical choice. And while he does use some innovative ideas (such as the pretty cool 'snake vision') the film is too darkly shot and edited like a blur. I don't find death to be funny and expected a stronger 'man vs nature' subtext to it. What we get is a man being bitten on the penis and stoners bitten while joining the Mile High Club. And the sudden, stinging attacks never seem to frighten. The first few kills are crass and exploitative and it spoils the mood for the rest of the film.I know I am being ridiculous criticising a no-brainer film such as this in such a way but even low-grade B-movies like Anaconda and it's sequel managed to be more scary and exciting than this. The characters are set-up in the typical horror film way and it's obvious which ones are going to die one by one. And while their deaths appear to violent, you never REALLY see anything shocking. A film with such an eccentric title really should have gone to crazy, far-fetched extremities and delivered loads of gore. But it never truly seems like it does. The majority of the film seems taped together from various different writers ideas and some scenes definitely feel tacked on after principal photography.Films set on panic-stricken planes are abundant (Exec Dec, Passenger 57, United 93, Con Air, Die Hard 2) and scenes of crash landings and decompression are nothing new to audiences. The presence of Snakes doesn't make it much different.Plus, Trevor Rabin's score is total crap. Plain and simple. Uninspired, generic rubbish completely without theme, melody, excitement our even coherence in it's endless bombasticness. I had great hopes for him when he did such brilliant work (actually co-composing) on Con Air and Armageddon, but he's fast proving to be talentless.Samuel L. Jackson is brilliant as always and the under-rated Julianna Margulies is quite bloody gorgeous, more so than more popular Hollywood actresses. Lin Shaye (a popular New Line actress, since her husband runs the studio) has more to do than usual in the role of a heroic stewardess and those of you who like her more comedic roles will find this a welcome change.

From the very beginning this movie had a problem with one-dimensional acting, acting that seemed to be unnatural and artificial. There were many distinctions between real and special effect snakes. There was little character development to care for the main characters, the snake expert was under-utilized. The lets put all the elements of action, horror, and worst case scenarios together made the movie too heavy for its own good. Actual aircraft pilot and crew procedure was thrown out the window.

The key word in that sentence is 'relatively' though because while the plot of the film makes sense, it is always far-fetched and silly, plus the movie is littered with stock stereotype characters. Samuel L. Jackson gives it his all in the lead role though as an FBI agent escorting an important witness in a mob murder trial; he does well uttering numerous quotable lines about the reptiles on board while spoofing Bond and Bourne to a degree with his constant asking of others to trust him and calmness under pressure. The film additionally features many memorable death scenes as the snakes crawl in and out of every single place, from handbags, to air sickness bags to toilet bowls; in fact, several of the snake attacks are scary and funny in equal measures. Clocking it at over 100 minutes, the movie nevertheless runs a little long given the slimness of the premise and the final scene is not a high note to end on. For the most part though, this is an unexpectedly amusing affair. Jackson might have agreed to be in the film based on its title, but the film deserves to be known for more than just that.",Snakes on a Plane

Considered a film in which has become somewhat of a cult classic for its effects and overall fun entertainment, the film does a great job at being entertainining with its effects and overall simple yet watchable plot. Snakes on a Plane was a box office flop, in which is why it did not have any sequel (easily could have turned into a franchise had the film been successful), although the film did generate some buzz years after its release (mainly die to the effect and its title).A lot of criticism for the film is that it is cheesy and unrealistic yet it is understood in what its intended to be. Samuel L Jackson plays his role well as he has been portraying this type of characters for his entire career, as well as some interesting characters involved in the cast.

56,johnnyboyz,"People went through the whole of the 1990's hating those van Damme/Seagal action films; and now, suddenly they love films like this.",5,24 February 2007,"Although engulfed in a huge wave of hype when first coming out and starring the now cult figure of Samuel L. Jackson in the lead 'hero' role, 'Snakes on a Plane' did nothing for me in terms of suspense, frights or jaw dropping action and personally, was a bit of a disappointment.It would be too easy to label the film as one you'd 'love to hate' but I certainly can't see why so many people do love it. This film is pretty much 'Eight Legged Freaks' (2002) meets a Steven Seagal film of some sort; probably more akin to 'Under Siege 2: Dark Territory' (1995) than any other. Neither of these two films got such an enormous wave of praise yet both are very similar in terms of brainlessness and both are guilty of having action serving as a substitute for much of a plot. Oddly enough, both films are probably better than Snakes on a Plane.What's bad about Snakes on a Plane and what puts it close to B movie material is its acting and all round colloquial approach to itself. The acting is pretty bad all throughout, the characters and their supposed back stories are introduced in a messy manner and the representation of both English people as typically posh people who have to take business class over all the other standard class scum and that of black people who are womanising, full of money and ego but not much sense was truly ridiculous. What was also rather surprising was its representation of the pilots. Pilots and captains of aeroplanes are highly decorated and educated people; but in this film  they seem more concerned with the pretty stewardess' removing their shirts rather than the fact they've just been bitten by a snake. This was as bad as it was unbelievable and completely zoned me out of the film; something that shouldn't happen  I should be made to feel I'm there: scare me, entertain me  do something. But no, not in Snakes on a Plane and this piece of representation made me laugh for the opposite reasons the makers wanted me to laugh for.When the snakes finally get to cause some grief, the film goes another gear down. The snakes look too fake and although pose a threat (merely due to the fact they're snakes and they're loose on a plane) they aren't particularly frightening as their intelligence and unrealistically aggressive manner extinguish everything they should be. The snakes act as the whole excuse for the film in the first place so most scenes are going to revolve around them in some way. Unfortunately these ways are done badly. The film slips into a stupor of 'whenever there's a break in proceedings, let's have another snake attack to wake the audience up!' Even when a scene involving the lead role going into the bowels of the plane to turn back on the electronics occurs; you don't feel anything as you know he's going to succeed in his mission and it just acts as a sorry excuse to include an action scene (which was subsequently rubbish).Towards the end, the film becomes a bit of a farce with tiny, little things going the passengers way. The fact there's an axe in the cockpit, the fact the hero had a knife in his belt the whole time (which he refused to use until this point) which is impossible for commercial flights these days given the world's security situation (It doesn't matter if you're in the FBI) and the fact the plane is eventually landed without too much build up and without too much trouble all serve as good examples.Maybe its because I saw it on a smaller screen than in the cinema but I feel I still would've picked up on these things and these things alone make Snakes on a Plane a BAD film; contrary to what the masses actually think. Just because it's Samuel L. Jackson and just because it's snakes  on an aeroplane; doesn't mean it's a good, great or even a cult film.",Snakes on a Plane

A movie with this kinda title shudnt b taken seriously. Don't expect acting, suspense or clever plotting frm these kinda action packed, adventure flicks. Much of the story takes place inside a plane where passengers try to survive an awful lot of dangerous/poisonous angry snakes in the plane. Initially the movie was meant to b pg13 but the makers, aft online fans' reaction turned it into an r rated one with good amount of killings n mayhem.

60,insomniac_rod,What could you expect from a title like this?,5,4 February 2008,"Ah, well, what could you expect from a movie that is named ""Snakes On A Plane""?. The premise is EXACTLY what you think so don't come up and say that you didn't expect it.Sure, the movie has a dumb, ridiculous plot but still it manages to deliver for B-movie fans who can take on Hollywood's ""unique"" point of view. Sure, it has the elements of a B-movie but sometimes it gets tedious because it tries to be a ""big budget smash hit"". That's just my opinion.Samuel L. Jackson saves the day with his badass performance but his infamous line that has to do with the ""F"" word repeated twice kills all seriousness.Expect plenty of good and cheap gore and plenty of snakes getting smashed, shot and more.Give it a chance ONLY if it airs on cable and you are a fan of the B-genre. Otherwise, you will want to vomit over and over again.",Snakes on a Plane
61,Anonymous_Maxine,"Wait a minute, you can bring a dog on a plane???",6,5 April 2008,"Snakes on a Plane is a movie of an increasingly rare breed. It includes a warning within the title, meaning that if you see a title like ""Snakes on a Plane"" and can't deduce that it's going to be preposterous in the extreme, then you deserve to feel ripped off. Now, like other laughable predecessors such as Anaconda, Battlefield Earth, and Gigli, it is more famous for being a bad movie than anything else. But unlike those movies, this is a GOOD bad movie, like Commando or Kickboxer. It's pretty clear that the movie was made in the over- the-top Grindhouse style and that it's meant to bring on laughs as much as action excitement. The special effects are a sufficient joke in themselves. The plot, as well, is meaningless. There is something at the beginning about a super-villain named Eddie Kim, who is on trial for the murder of a pesky prosecutor, whose murder was witnessed by Sean Jones, an all-American surfer kid in Hawaii. Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) heads up the FBI team assigned to escort him back to Los Angeles for Kim's trial. Sadly, what they fail to realize is that Kim is of the supervillain variety that is able to mobilize hundreds of illegal poisonous snakes from all over the world and get them placed onto a passenger airliner.What I love is that Agent Flynn takes over the first class cabin of an airliner bound for Los Angeles with such short notice that the stewardesses don't even know it's coming until they have to send the first class passengers to coach on their way onto the plane, but not with such short notice that Kim can't order the entire plane loaded up with exotic venomous snakes. Now THAT'S power! But of course, it goes without saying that logic doesn't apply well to this movie. At one point, the co-captain of the plane worries that with the snakes crawling around in the air ducts, they might short circuit the whole plane and it will plummet helplessly from the sky. Are modern passenger jets really so poorly designed that some pests loose upstairs can doom an entire plane full of passengers? It's also up for debate whether or not you can email pictures from a cell phone while at cruising speed. I happen to know that your standard cell phone is above reception only a few seconds after take-off. You'd be surprised how unconcerned cell phone companies are with considering elevation in their cell phone coverage. Maybe someone had a satellite phone. Lots of people carry those aroundThere is, however, one thing that is certainly interesting to me. I live in China and I have a dog, and in about a year and a half I'll be moving back to California. My assumption is that it will probably be nearly impossible to bring my dog back home with me, and that the best I can hope for is months of quarantine and a staggering cost. I only wish it was so easy that I could just bring her on the plane with me!(spoilers) Many reviewers defend the movie by saying that Kim, the bad guy, doesn't matter, it's the snakes that are the villain. Obviously, that's exactly right, but if the snakes are the villain, why have Kim at all? He's introduced as this brutal gangster, and then at the end, once the snakes are taken care of, he disappears from the movie as Flynn and Jones go surfing. Maybe Flynn forgot he still had a super high-profile trial to attend to. Or maybe, like us, he realizes that the trial doesn't matter, and that after even a sparse 85 minutes or so of this movie, most of the audience is ready to go home. The movie is not a total loss, of course. There is definitely an audience, and definitely some situations in which many people who initially hated it could still enjoy it. Invite a bunch of your buddies over one night and have a few beers and watch this movie, and if you don't have a good time, you need to loosen up a little. There are hilarious special effects, a nice amount of bronzed blonde nudity, and someone gets bitten in every groan-inducing place you can think of. Like it or not, it's a rousing, stupid good time!",Snakes on a Plane
62,jzappa,I'm thoroughly annoyed,6,9 September 2006,"First off, I'm the one that was telling all of my friends that Snakes On a Plane actually looked good, even when they were snobbishly spouting that it looked awful and that they would never see that. Once it came out, I was busy seeing Scoop, and was shocked to find that every one of my friends had seen Snakes On a Plane and urging me to see it. On IMDb, at the time, it had a rating of 8.4. The only problem is, I don't like it when a movie decides to be a thriller that pokes fun at other thrillers instead of just being a thriller. The former is what Snakes On A Plane is. It's a good movie, because for audiences that do like that, it delivers sensationally. I saw it anyway because what I thought looked good about it was its premise. A plane full of poisonous snakes: Great suspense. No escape from these slithering, naturally scary things that will bite you to fill you with venom or swallow you whole. And yet, for instance, no suspense is ever made of reducing the plane's temperature, as snakes cannot move when they're cold, and causing the passengers to freeze as well. But it never occurs to anyone, not even a snake expert who comes along later, to try hindering the snakes this way.I was entertained at the bare minimum amount of entertained I can be with a movie. I know it's a certain kind of film that you just have to take for what it is, which can be great, but I just don't understand why you would take such a good concept and then butcher it by purposely filling it with aggravating clichés, which include the characters and the mechanics of the plot. Honestly, the only characters I liked were the cat, the dogs, the snakes, and the rapper's two bodyguards. I thought the two bodyguards were hilarious. On the other hand, the hand with every other character on it, I thought Jackson gave a highly amiable performance as a dull character, I thought the murder witness he protects was completely flat and boring---both the character and the actor---to the point where I kept forgetting that he existed, the flight attendants, the outlandishly snooty Englishman, the valley girl, the perverted pilot, the cop on land that works on the case even when his family waits for him to come home, ad infinitum, are all vital signs of a self-destructive movie.Take all of these characters, massacre them, and replace them with new and interesting characters in a movie that takes advantage of its authentically scary plot line, bazooka the script and re-tool the plot and make it good and gripping. Snakes On a Plane in its present condition is Airplane! 3.",Snakes on a Plane
63,Vartiainen,"Cheesy fun, light on story",5,23 January 2016,"A film that garnered as much recognition as it did solely because of its great title. That title is the epitome of a cheesy B-movie. And because those films are often so much fun in a ""so bad, it's good"" kind of way, this film gathered a large audience. The original movie was supposed to be much darker in tone, but they changed it to meet the demand. A good decision, because I don't think the original vision would have resulted in anything better.Snakes on a Plane is a lot of fun, that has to be admitted. Samuel L. Jackson is constantly hamming it up as a FBI agent entrusted with the protection of an eye witness against a dangerous gangster boss. A boss so deranged and out of his mind that he thinks it a genius plan to assassinate this witness by having hundreds of snakes released during a trans-Pacific flight. I have no idea how the original plan was for this to be anything but an honest B-movie.But yes, the film has problems. The acting is not very good, aside from Jackson, who's so hammy that while he's bad, he's at least entertaining. The snakes are done largely with CGI, and they haven't aged all that well. The plot is hold together by the thinnest of margins. And quite honestly the first third of the film is actually somewhat boring.Though, to the film's credit, it is a lot of fun once the snakes get going. I also like the way it keeps messing with our expectations when it comes to character stereotypes. The science dude is not overly nerdy or socially awkward. The rebel is actually a very gentle soul, while still very physically capable. Things like that. You've seen such inversions before, but they do add to the film's value.If you're going to see this film, see it with a bunch of friends that like to laugh. Watched alone it's merely somewhat entertaining. With like-minded friends, it's hilarious.",Snakes on a Plane
64,GOWBTW,Now that's an adrenaline rush there!,10,28 August 2006,"When they say this movie will leave you on the edge of your seat, they weren't kidding! ""Snakes on a Plane"" is intense, hard-core, non-stop, action thriller that will leave your skin crawling for hours. Having a plane laced with very lethal vipers is crazy, especially when a Asian mobster will do anything to stay out of prison. There you got this no-nonsense FBI Agent(Samuel L. Jackson) who protects the witness from him and his thugs. Now on a plane, there's pleasure for some and panic for others. The pleasure is for the couple who go into the washroom not only to get high, but to enjoy the euphoria as well when it was cut short by some snakes; he got the neck, while she took it to the you know what! Then there's another guy who gets a another longer snake, the painful way! Well every pitches in to survive the horror on the flight, most of them sacrificed their lives for the sake of others. And the performer's bodyguards did their jobs well. I was able to identify a few breeds of those poisonous snakes, I glad this country didn't have them. A very fun movie to be exact, and Samuel L. Jackson seems to get lucky with one of the stewardess. Way to go! Only the strong must watch this movie. DANGER! ""Snakes on a Plane""! HAHAHAHA!!!",Snakes on a Plane
65,dfranzen70,Worthy of most of the hype,7,27 August 2006,"There's been a bucketload of hype over this movie, and for my money it's mostly deserved. Of course, a few years from now it's not likely the movie will be thought of as anything more than a cult classic, if that, but for the moment we're in the midst of a phenomenon.Some have said that the best part of this movie is its title. But no! The best thing is Samuel L. Jackson, for if it weren't for his lending gravitas to the situation, this would be an entirely forgettable movie. Jackson, as he's done in just about every one of the zillion movies in which he's appeared, raises the level of the movie a notch or two every time he opens his mouth.Quick backstory: Jackson, playing FBI Agent Flynn, is transporting Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips), a witness to a murder, from Hawaii to Los Angeles. The thug against whom Jones will testify, it seems, has a reputation for doing nasty things to those who would testify against him, but somehow Flynn convinces Jones to take the trip east, and on the plane they go.Before the plane takes off, we meet, in typical disaster-movie fashion, the crew and some of the other passengers, including a flight-phobic man and his wife, a a Paris Hilton-like young woman (and her teeny-tiny dog), two young boys travelling alone, an obnoxious Rich White Man, and a rap mogul and his bodyguards. Oh, and the lecherous copilot (David Koechner) and the standard this-is-my-last-time-out flight attendant, played by Juliana Margulies.The snakes show up a good half hour into the movie. Which is understandable, since it's kind of important to establish characters. Who would turn out to behave above and beyond the call of civic duty? Who would cower? Whose death, indeed, would we openly root for? But then the snakes do arrive on screen, and all hell breaks loose. People get bitten on the EYE. The eye, folks, the eye! Ow! And on the butt, and the groin, and the leg, and.. well, you get the idea. Hardly a body part is left unnibbled, really, and that's part of the entertainment.All kinds of snakes are on the plane, too, including one 22-foot behemoth. Flynn radios to LA so that maybe antivenom could be waiting for them when they finally land. Only, see, because there are so many different snakes, each with a different kind of venom, that's a tall order. Ah, but worry not, there's some deus ex machina at work, so that potential plothole is quickly sealed.Some of the movie reminded me of The Poseidon Adventure, only the plane's never upside down. Rather, people are herded into the upper-deck first class (previously inhabited only by Jones, the witness), merely because it's the only place the snakes haven't yet reached.Jackson adds a lot to the movie. Verily, he IS the movie; his charisma completely carries the film. It's true that the man hardly ever turns down scripts, which means sometimes he's in some utterly awful movies, but he still manages to come out of them all with his reputation as being the baddest mutha in Hollywood intact. Even when he's tender, he's a badass. That's Samuel L. Jackson. He's just what this movie needed.The film does earn some demerits, though. For one thing, I think it could have been campier; sometimes it felt like it was going for a straightfaced plane-in-peril vibe, and other times it was a parody of such films. Other than that, though, I thought it was wildly entertaining, even nail biting. Harrowing moment: When the door to the cockpit opens and all you see are raindrop missiles coming at the plane - and the pilots are incapacitated.",Snakes on a Plane

SOaP uses just about every cliché figure and situation from airplane movies,FBI and cop shows and presents them as straight - faced as possible,obviously a successful formula as it took $34million at the Box Office. Mr S.L. Jackson solemnly takes his presumably not - inconsiderable paycheck and earns it for not laughing out loud until the cameras had stopped rolling.Only Miss J.Margullies matches him in the ""Big Star"" being a good sport"" stakes. The rest of the cast are no more than competent,if you're not over - critical. The plot - which was old even before it became a staple of 1970s TV movies - concerns Mr Jackson seeing a witness safely to L.A. to help convict a mobster . The rest you can work out yourself merely by reading the title. It runs out of steam quite early on,but you'll probably see it through because it seems just like old times.",Snakes on a Plane
67,kevin_robbins,This is a movie that is terrible and is okay with that,2,28 September 2021,"Snakes on a Plane (2006) is a movie I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a whiteness against a drug cartel being flown to testify in a key case. When the cartel discovers the plane the whiteness is on, they fill the bottom of the plane with snakes and let them loose. This movie is directed by David R. Ellis (Sphere) and stars Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), Julianna Margulies (Ghost Ship), Kenan Thompson (Saturday Night Live), Lin Shaye (Insidious) and Sunny Mabrey (xXx: State of the Union). The storyline and movie is very cheesy and cliche outside of a few good bite locations; I mean, everyone can appreciate a good boob and eye bite. The movie relies heavily on CGI that look terrible in a Sharknado kind of way. There are a few funny lines here and there and my favorite part of the movie is when they land the plane at the end. Overall this is a movie that is terrible and is okay with that...so I'll score it as so, lol. I'd give this a 2/10 and recommend skipping it.",Snakes on a Plane
68,dee.reid,Snakes... On... A... Plane?!?,10,19 August 2006,"Man, and Indiana Jones would have a heart attack if he ever took this flight!""Snakes on a Plane"" is a masterpiece of pre-Internet hype and exploitation of some of our most basic fears of being trapped on a plane with hundreds of poisonous snakes. This just makes it even better. First off, this is pure ""B""-grade fun, already destined for instant cult status. A campy, volatile blend of ""Speed,"" ""Die Hard,"" ""Terror at 10,000 Feet"" and gallows humor, ""Snakes on a Plane"" is the very definition of the cult flick. With a snappy script by co-writers John Heffernan and Sean Gutierrez, the film begins with a murder: a crusading attorney is beaten to death with a baseball bat by a vengeful drug dealer. Poor sap surfer-dude Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) witnesses the act but before he can sign up for the F.B.I.'s Witness Protection Program, assassins show up at his apartment to dispatch him. F.B.I. Agent Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) rescues him at the last moment and blows the bad guys away. Sean gets the duty of having to testify at the murder trial for the prosecution, but it requires a red-eye from Hawaii to Los Angeles. However, in an absurd ploy that brings back memories of something you might see on ""Mission: Impossible,"" the bad guys manage to sneak a time-release device onto the flight that is loaded with hundreds of venomous CGI slippery slither-ers. Faster than you can scream ""Holy sh!t,"" the nasties are slithering their way out of oxygen masks, vents, consoles, toilet bowls (watch out!) and other mechanical openings and attacking the passengers in increasingly shocking fashions, leaving only Agent Flynn to lead Sean, the crew (including Julianna Margulies), and frightened extras (Rachel Blanchard and Kenan Thompson to name a few) to fight the snakes. Director David R. Ellis keeps a tense pace, and is keen to offer only flashy glimpses of the most gruesome carnage (something he didn't see fit to do in his earlier ""Final Destination 2""). Few of this film's players, especially the 50+ snakebite victims and hundreds of CGI, real-life and animatronic snakes, survive unscathed. For all it's worth, this is one ride horror film fanatics will want to take.10/10",Snakes on a Plane

70,Chris_Docker,"Bite me, squeeze me, baby!",6,4 September 2006,"Halfway between Men in Black and Final Destination, the fright-humour of Snakes on a Plane makes little attempt at a realistic storyline but does deliver as party spirit, night-out entertainment. FBI man, Samuel L. Jackson is the all-action, wise-cracking FBI agent conducting a vital witness by plane to Los Angeles. The bad guys have filled the plane's hold with snakes and timed things so the snakes get to the passengers mid-flight. The first half is straight humour, and the rest, tongue-in-cheek terror of the so-bad-it's-good variety. Pneumatic babes and male-bonding jokes, but with soft-touch additions of puppy dogs and babies, make Snakes on a Plane one for the lads but one the girlfriends will enjoy too.The opening scenes of curvaceous chicks, Hawaii beaches and a fast bike ride (as well as self-conscious product placement) are interrupted by a grisly gang execution to show it's not too lightweight; once airborne, we have useful flight information such as how to disable a fire alarm and have mile-high sex, or make a flamethrower from household ingredients. It runs almost like an X-rated edition of Blue Peter, including an ending that shows you the Best Way to Get Snakes off a Plane and a new take on How to Land a Jumbo Jet.The snakes look delightfully home-made, come in many different varieties, and are even occasionally scary. Samuel L. Jackson carries the film but is aided and abetted by a reasonable supporting cast. The gags include pre-release parodies sent in by fans - before the end you may even find yourself thinking, ""Wouldn't it be funny if . . . ,"" and then find they've included what you had in mind. The final music video (over the first part of the credits) sends everyone out in a feelgood orgy of (relatively) bad taste.If you have low expectations of this film, you may find them fulfilled more enjoyably than you imagined. It drags slightly in the middle (how many variations of being bitten by a snake are there, for goodness sake . . . ) but picks up again for a raucous conclusion.

Anyways this is a more than decent B-grade monster flick, which is all it ever tries to be.Jackson is supercool as an FBI agent with his hands full, when a jet cargo of poisonous snakes is deliberately released on passengers by a mob boss trying to kill a witness being flown from Honolulu to Los Angeles to testify.I liked the set up to this movie, with all the passengers and crew boarding, some familiar faces there and its fun figuring out who's going to bite it first and how.

Ellis): Horror-like adventure in the sky fails to be more than a couple of scares and un-necessary nudity and gross death-like scenes. Samuel L. Jackson couldn't even really help much with this cliché-ridden movie. There's the sex-filled young couple doing an un-necessary sex(aka. Death) scene that you normally see in ""Friday the 13th""-type horror movies, the brave cool people, the nerds and the scaredy-cats. It's almost like having a high school horror comedy in the sky. The snakes are frightening, of course, when they jump out at you, which they do often  but are otherwise computer-generated colorful fake-looking serpents. It starts becoming fun near the end when the pilot becomes a PSP simulator expert when the other pilots get killed, but it's too late to make it worthwhile. So that's about it. A cheap horror, disaster movie in the sky with snakes and an FBI agent protecting an important witness to a mobster who supposedly planted the snakes on the plane with pheramones to make them crazy and put the plane down to insure the death of the witness. A lot to go thru and a lot of money spent for the death of one man. A definitely silly premise when you figure a bullet in the head from a sniper would have been much cheaper and less filled with possible problems then what they came up with. So basically, back to the movie, there are cardboard characters, a silly story and much to miss with this highly advertised summer fare.",Snakes on a Plane

Rachel Blanchard, Kenan Thompson, David Koechner, Sunny Mabrey, Lin Shaye and Elsa Pataky have memorable roles in the film. Of course, Samuel L.

76,fertilecelluloid,Runs out of hiss real quick,3,30 January 2008,"""Snakes on a Plane"" is barely amusing. It teeters on the edge of tolerable and forgettable. Samuel Jackson, an FBI man, needs to escort a witness (Nathan Phillips) from Honolulu to LA to testify against a notorious Hawaiian bad guy. Somehow, the bad guy's goons manage to smuggle a bunch of snakes onto Jackson's flight. At a specific time, the snakes are set loose. Their first victims are a horny couple getting ready to screw in the plane's bathroom. In a display of great showmanship, a snake attaches itself to the woman's massive mammaries, then sets its beady digital eyes on her boyfriend. The rest of the movie features similar incidents. A man's pecker is assaulted while he urinates. A kid is bitten. A fatty gets her ass and face attacked. Samuel Jackson steps into the hero role after the plane's pilots are dispatched by snakes. There is no suspense and little fun, despite what I've described. The predictability factor is sky high. The problem here is lack of substance beyond the gimmick. A plane is an enclosed space. There's really nowhere to go. And because the writers were content to create one- dimensional characters, the whole affair runs out of hiss very quickly. The all-digital snakes are a problem, too, because we never feel any sense of revulsion at their presence. Real snakes, by design, are a little scary. These are not.",Snakes on a Plane
77,TOMNEL,"Silly, corny, extremely entertaining and funny action flick.",8,20 August 2006,"Stars: Samuel L. Jackson, Julianna Margolis, Rachel Blanchard, Nathan Phillips, Kenan Thompson, Bruce James and David Koechner.There are so many action films made like this, very few actually work like this one. The setup to this movie is a throw away one. Sean (Blanchard), a surfer witnesses a murder by a notorious gangster, and cop Nelville (Jackson) is the cop watching him before he testifies. They get in a plane and take up all of first class. The notorious gangster wants to make sure he doesn't talk so they release deadly snakes from around the world on the plane. Violence ensues. For a film like this (a B-movie), it does many things very well. It has humor, almost making this a comedy. It seems like all the humor would be corny and lame, but it actually is funny, a lot of the time when the passengers are being attacked by snakes. As for violence, this film has some disturbing stuff. Dead bodies and lots of gore. The dialog is pretty good as is the direction. My problem is that this film does get corny at times, but it has enough to sustain it from being a stinker, and enough to revive it to a good movie. Finally onto the acting. Samuel L. Jackson is always good, even though the role could really go to any action star. Julianna Margolis was entertaining. Many people play supporting roles that people recognize but forget their names, including Kenan Thompson in a large role as a bodyguard and David Koechner (from Achorman, 40 Year Old Virgin, Talladega Nights). I highly recommend this popcorn munching comedy thriller! My rating: ***/****. 101 mins. rated R for Language, Strong Violence and Gore, Sexuality and Nudity.",Snakes on a Plane
78,aharmas,Great film,10,19 August 2006,"Here is a movie that doesn't stop to catch its breath. It delivers from every possible angle, with some nifty special effects, effective acting, and some cool surprises.It's a tribute to the disaster films of the 70's that we love so much, and there is not a super human in sight but some very scared passengers. The script is clever, funny and full of surprises and one-liners. Everything is the film works like a well-oiled machine. Just sit, hold your breath, and enjoy the ride.Jackson and a very capable cast will give you two hours of amazing fun.Go see it!",Snakes on a Plane
79,Jonny_Numb,"For a bad movie, you could do a lot worse",6,26 August 2006,"Two rows in front of me, a trio of vocal teenagers were talking before ""Snakes on a Plane,"" reading the silent advertisements being projected on the screen verbatim, as if their delivery lent the words some kind of comic genius (it did not). I thought to myself: ""Great, I'm at a movie that's supposed to be so bad it's good, and already the idiots down front are doing their fifth-rate 'Beavis and Butt-head' routine."" I then came to the conclusion that I resented American youth of today tremendously--after all, they are to blame for the popularity of Emo bands, cellular phones, and movies like ""Snakes on a Plane,"" a wheel of cheese with the unprecedented, homegrown Internet hype machine covering its back.As the lights went down and the previews began, Beavis, Butt-head, and Daria all politely shut up...and, oddly enough, remained quiet for the duration of the film. On the other hand, my father and I, who had been relatively quiet prior to the film, let loose with laughter almost immediately. This ironic reversal seemed to come as a result of years of yukking it up alongside Mike (and Joel) and the 'bots on The Satellite of Love. While ""Snakes on a Plane"" takes itself fairly seriously (and its hybrid of action and horror works fairly well), we also should keep in mind that director David R. Ellis (a former second-unit director turned actual director) gave us ""Cellular,"" a thriller that wound up delivering more goofily implausible absurdities than chills.While innocently motorbiking (and showboating for the camera), Hunky Young Man (Nathan Phillips, ""Wolf Creek"") just happens upon a beaten stoolie hanging upside-down from a tree; fleeing to some nearby bushes, Hunky witnesses the Honolulu Yakuza bashing the poor sucker's brains out with a bat. Hunky flees, only to have the Yakuza make an attempt on his life. Enter Neville Flynn (cool-as-an-iced-cucumber Samuel L. Jackson), who guarantees the boy's safety if he agrees to testify against the gangster in Los Angeles. This will not stand with said gangster, who decides that the most efficient way to eliminate the witness is to unleash a box full of poisonous snakes on the red-eye flight transporting said witness.Director Ellis sticks to convention as if he's paying loving homage to its very existence: we get the simple setup (snakes + plane = hijinks!); the midsection, containing much rapidly-edited action (lots of people falling, being bitten, and getting run over by drink trolleys); and the climax, which takes a standard cliché of airplane-in-peril movies and runs with it. And why not? To his credit, Ellis's style may be in the action-thriller mold, but it bypasses the grue and sadism of your typical Michael Bay productioninstead, our desperate characters band together to take on a hopeless situation (kinda like ""The Oregon Trail""), and become better people in the end. In a sense, ""Snakes on a Plane"" is about the triumph of the human spirit as much as it is about snakeson a plane.The characters, like the structural conventions, are similarly bound by cliché. Among the potential snake-bite fodder: a horny young couple who violates 2 rules of horror cinema (1: don't attempt sex in an airplane bathroom; 2: don't dismantle the smoke alarm in said bathroom); an aging stewardess (Lin Shaye) who could have retired a month earlier; a rap artist and his entourage; resourceful, professional stewardess (Julianna Margulies, who often seems both amused and annoyed by the whole enterprise); Jackson's partner-for-ten-years (the utterance of such information is always a death wish); the standard-issue jerk who tosses a woman's Chihuahua to a hungry anaconda; and yes, there IS a baby on board. Even Flynn is a howling cliché who would be completely nondescript were it not for Jackson's tireless efforts. As for the snakes, they are seldom as frightening as one would think, and it's rather hard to take them seriously when they bite body parts most ripe for comic relief.With such a threadbare plot and characters straight out of a '50s B movie, ""Snakes on a Plane"" might have a limited box office run once the hype wears off, but will endurefor better or worseas a call-and-response cult classic in the vein of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show."" For the time being, however, it is a great movie for people who love bad movies.",Snakes on a Plane
80,rbverhoef,Mindless fun,6,12 March 2007,"The title 'Snakes on a Plane' is the kind of title that makes a story unnecessary. In fact, the film could have done without the first twenty minutes or so; we all know the real film starts once the main characters are all on that plane. Those characters include a lot of poisonous snakes and of course FBI Agent Samuel L. Jackson, who is taking a key witness from Hawaii to Los Angeles.Why is not important, the snakes are there, killing off every characters that is not introduced including the captain. Now we have both the snakes and the plane out of control. It is to Jackson to save the day. On the ground we follow another FBI Agent, tracking down snake experts and illegal snake holders to help Jackson the best way possible.'Snakes on a Plane' is a movie that delivers exactly what the title promises it does.

The idea of throwing snakes on a plane is intelligent, because there is no way to escape, but the plot wasn't interesting and I dare to say it was even boring. I mean, the film isn't even over yet and I'm already here to warn you how bad it is, so trust me, it brings nothing new or entertaining for us. At least we got a funny scene when the sexy lady and the muscle boy are getting laid in the bathroom, the snake comes to them and they shake the room desperately, making it looks like they're having a hardcore lol.

83,Kamurai25,"""A Plane of Terror""",7,18 October 2020,"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend, especially for a bad movie night.For such a horrible premise, this actually holds up pretty well. It's a bad movie, but it's still pretty entertaining. The snakes almost have the same behavior / pacing as a ""blob"", slowly seeping through the plane and over taking people bit by bit.Without a veteran actors like Samuel L. Jackson or Kenan Thompson to hold things together this could have easily fallen apart in a much worse way.The ""realism"" is certainly not a concern. While pheromones are a thing that can incite some behaviors, snakes aren't loyal to each other, especially different species. Once you accept the initial scenario, every ridiculous thing that happens is funny, and the tension is up just because you have no idea where the snakes are coming from at any time, and the knowledge that the entire setting could just fall out of the sky, even if enough people survive the snakes it could all end with a crash.There is likely a truly good version of this movie we could get, but for now, making fun of this one should be a good time.",Snakes on a Plane

It has its catchy title, it has its riveting trailer where Samuel L. Jackson does his famous line, but that's just all it seems to have. The hype around ""Snakes On A Plane"" was so overwhelming when it came out that actually seeing the movie seemed like overkill. The idea itself is sorta amusing, but 90 minutes of ""motherf@cking snakes on a motherf@cking plane""? It just gets old fast, and the bland characters (except for the villain, who's in it way too briefly) don't really help matters much either. ""Snakes"" is just a movie that completely ran out of ideas after it got its basic premise, it's a pedestrian B-movie at best and a really boring one at worst. The only thing that sorta saves it is Samuel L. Jackson, who can instantly make any movie so much better, even ones that barely deserve it. Overall though it's not really worth seeing.",Snakes on a Plane
85,Matt_Layden,The Best Picture Of The Decade....To Feature Snakes On Planes.,8,27 August 2006,"An FBI agent saves the life of a man who witnesses a murder. The murderer, Eddie Kim, knows the witness will testify against him and hatches a plan so brilliant it's dumb. He releases tons of poisonous snakes on the plane that was destined for L.A. Hence the title, Snakes On A Plane.What made Snakes On A Plane, or SoaP, so popular before it came out? Well, it could be a number of things, first the ridiculous title that kicks ass and sums up the entire plot of the film. Second, it's star who's known as a badass mofo, that would be none other then Samuel L. Jackson. How about the fact the the fans got to have their ideas put into the film. More violence, more nudity and more swearing from Sam Jackson was added because of the voice of the fans. If these elements were not part of the film, then SoaP would no doubt be a straight to video release like some other inane horror films, Boa Vs Python comes to mind. SoaP though, rises above those crappy B horror campy films, even though it is indeed one itself. Much like this years Slither, SoaP is a film that takes the horror genre and the comedy genre and mixes it with campy style that is destined to make it a cult classic. With a specific target audience and an attitude that says the film will be awful, but enjoy it for what it is, SoaP manages to be...actually good. SoaP will be one of those films that you can have drinking games to, whenever someone says ""snake"" take a shot.I'm not going to talk about plot holes in the film, cause it's SNAKES ON A PLANE. With a title like that you have to expect stupid things to happen, and stupid things indeed do happen. You must see the film with a group of friends in order to get the full enjoyment out of it. You'll be laughing at scenes where people throw dogs at snakes and where a harpoon Gun is used as a weapon, but you can forgive such things, cause well...it's SNAKES ON A PLANE. The stupidity mixes very well with the comedy, seeing a snake get sucked out of the side of the plane, with a guy still in it's mouth is something you either laugh at or roll your eyes at, and if you're rolling your eyes in the film, then you missed the point of it.Is this Sam Jackson at his best? Of course not, he's just here to have a fun time, he gets to shoot snakes, burn snakes, taser snakes, and beat them. I would have liked to have Jackson do more of his swearing though, I don't think it would have taken away from his ""Mo F'in snakes on this Mo F'in plane"" line, cause that's gold on it's own. He is indeed a badass and that's what one should expect. Everyone else does surprisingly well, the supporting cast help round out the film.I can't help but ask for more violence in this already violent film. Yes it was originally rated PG-13, but once adding new scenes, involving nudity and bad language, you would expect a bit more violence. There are a lot of fast paced snake attacks, involving eyes, throats and faces, but it could have been so much more. It was pretty random to see a heel from a woman's shoe being stuck in a man's ear.All in all, you can't expect all too much from the film. Afterall, it is called SNAKES ON A PLANE. It's not as ""badass"" as one would think, but it is a fun ride. It delivers what it promises, snakes on a plane, snakes on crack and a badass Sam Jackson. Soap is the best picture of the decade, to feature snakes on planes.",Snakes on a Plane

88,brando647,Modern B-Movie Fun,7,12 August 2008,"When a movie has a title so straight and to the point, you kind of know what to expect when you watch it. The title and premise is simple, but it's enough to make most people curious. Air travel is enough to make the average person nervous, but when you toss in a load of venomous snakes and no escape it tends to grab your attention. Samuel L. Jackson is FBI agent Neville Flynn, who has been assigned to bring a witness to Los Angeles from Honolulu to testify against a crime boss. This same crime boss has discovered which flight the witness is on and delivered a crate of venomous snakes to ensure he never makes it to the mainland.For such a simple premise, the movie takes a bit too long getting to the point. As the audience, we want one thing when watching this movie: snakes on a plane. So, why do we bother wasting so much time getting to know so many other passengers? This movie would've benefited from centering on a handful of central characters and developing them, rather than half the flight roster. What's worse is that most of the characters are just two-dimensional archetypes: the pampered rich girl (Rachel Blanchard), a rap superstar and his entourage (Flex Alexander, Kenan Thompson, and Keith Dallas), the ill-tempered arrogant lawyer, an amorous young couple interested in all the things that get you killed in a horror movie, and more. While there wasn't much to the characters, there were some decent performances from the cast. I've enjoyed Julianna Margulies in some of her other work and she worked well as the retiring flight attendant. Alexander and Thompson were probably some of my favorite performances in the film, providing the bulk of the comic relief (though David Koechner contributes quite a bit as the Rick, the co-pilot). Of course, no one compares to the almighty Sam Jackson, for whom it is impossible to NOT be bad-ass.Even though the movie had no real character development to speak of, I still thought the cast did great with what they were handed. So what about the stars of the film: the snakes themselves? The CGI could've used a bigger budget, that's for sure. The real snakes look great when they're actually on screen, but all of the CGI snakes are blatantly obvious (some looking like they belong in a Sci-Fi Channel original movie). It was distracting at times when I would become engaged in a scene and be ripped out of it by poor effects.Weak story. Lack of character development. Second-rate CGI. Plot holes. Who cares? The movie still delivers on what it promised: a fun thriller with a cool premise. It has the potential to become a cult favorite with it's campiness and, of course, Sam Jackson's signature line. It's good for some ""check-your-brain-at-the-door"" entertainment.",Snakes on a Plane

Well, the main point is that there are snakes on a plane. You should've probably known that, by now.The title gives what it says. There was this internet hype, going around. I was one of the fans. I have to say that this movie did not live up to the hype. This movie promises a B movie and it is a B movie, but I thought it would be better. The snakes kill people, of course, but how many ways can they kill? Most of the deaths are decent. Some are surprising.The plot is good and the acting from Samuel L. Jackson, Julianna Margulies, and Nathan Phillips give good performances. There are clichéd passengers in the flight, including a newly married couple, a British punk, kids traveling alone, and a mother with a baby. The people get into scary situations, like turning on the air conditioner and killing snakes.There are some animal kills, which some of you might don't like. You might feel sorry for some characters that died. I did. Like the director spends time developing them and they die in one second, which is bad, because you hope they survive. There are also non-snake deaths. And towards the end of the film, there's this big dramatic moment.The movie delivers what it promises.

90,sme_no_densetsu,Surprisingly not as bad as it sounds,7,25 September 2008,"Supposedly, Samuel L. Jackson signed on to this film solely because of the forthrightness of the title. This film is the very definition of high concept: There's a plane and there are snakes on it, 'nuff said.It's a good thing that Jackson was on board because this is the type of movie that needs a Samuel L. Jackson-type presence in order to lend it validity. While there are a few other recognizable names the film is mostly populated with forgettable actors in equally forgettable roles.The story is obviously pretty straightforward but, amazingly, the premise turns out to be not as asinine as it sounds. While there are several moments that will require considerable suspension of disbelief it doesn't cripple what is essentially a tongue-in-cheek story. Still, like most films of this type, there were at least a couple of moments that had me rolling my eyes and/or shaking my head.The presentation isn't bad though this is hardly a film with aspirations towards technical greatness. At least the production values are not as poor as you would expect for a film of this ilk, most of which are justifiably released straight-to-video. Unfortunately, it must be said that the special effects look pretty cheap. Nevertheless, I got a kick out of the snake-vision that was shown from time to time.This is not a great film; it's not even a good film; it's a bad film done right; it's a turn-off-your-brain-and-buckle-your-seatbelt type of film that hits its mark (more or less).

Absolutely. This film is one big roller coaster ride. It delivers on everything that it promises there are lots of nasty snakes and they are on a plane. The film is downright cheesy and not afraid to indulge in it's Campiness and the plot although borrowed from several other better films is at it's most entertaining here and that is what Soap is all about. Entertainment. And it's great entertainment. The film centers around a young man who witnesses a brutal murder committed by a crime lord. He escapes their clutches and is taken in by Samuel L. Jackson who stars as an FBI agent escorting him from Hawaii to LA where he can testify against him. There's only one big problem the bad guys have stashed a crap load of poisonous snakes aboard the airplane and have coated the Laius with fermions designed to drive them crazy and make them highly aggressive. And that there people is it pretty cut and dry. That's the plot. Don't expect any exciting plot revelations even though the films boasts some surprisingly confident character growth. What ensues is a hellish onslaught of snake attacks gory, scary and crazy as hell. As the film moves from one action set piece to another the film amps up the tension and violence becoming increasingly brutal but never realistic or unfunny. I must say its been a long time since I've seen a brilliantly fun flick like this. it brings me back to all those cheese fests of the 80's that I loved to watch. What makes Soap work is everything together the film is never played straight it's played for cheap thrills and spontaneous laughs. The audience I saw it with seemed to have a ball, the theater experience of their lives. And it wasn't even very packed.

Julianna Margulies from ""E.R."" is one of the stalwart stewardesses, and the rest of the cast is straight out of 1970's AIRPORT, a mixed bag of stereotypes just waiting to get bit. As SNAKES is an ""R""-rated enterprise, we get to see a bit of close-up nudity and snakes biting men and women on every imaginable part of their bodies. The CGI snakes are beautifully rendered, although the rubber models are just that: rubber models.

I finally saw this film and the reviews are true: this is a lot of fun, and nothing more than snakes on a plane.This is not a film that needs a lot of thought, to look for a lot of hidden meanings, the truth about snakes and criminals...it's as one dimensional as it gets - B movie fun.The theater I was in at 7:45PM was 3/4 of the way full and folks laughed and clapped and we all had a blast at ""the"" line. (Yes, that will be a classic for all time.) But I noticed that everyone in the theater filled up all the back rows first. People packed themselves in EVERY seat in the back rows. The top rows close to the screen were very empty - because, I think, we were all chickens. After all, these were snakes. And you saw a lot of them.And here's a school of thought: one of my fellow IMDb posters had already mentioned what this film needed was 'guest stars'. I like the film the way it was...but just the thought of adding 'guest stars' and blockbuster type directors and producers like Michael Bay or Jerry Bruckheimer should tell you why the film was the way it was.Sure, this film would have kicked the summer's blockbuster $$$$ route butt by putting in millions of dollars more, bring in someone like David Knoepp to supervise the screenplay, adding those plasticated Michael Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer action and casting folks like Roseanne Barr, Carmen Electra, Lindsay Lohan, Channing Tatum, Flava Flav, Nick Cannon, Carlos Mencia, Clive Owen, and a special appearance by Stephen Chow (for those who have seen the film just picture these folks in the appropriate parts - its not that hard to do...) and it would have brought in 50 million its first week and made it an 'A' film. But that is just TOO easy...too formula...too ""I've seen this type of thing before so many times, how many more times must they ram it down my throat to make a buck"". This goes the ""other"" way, the 'B' way. Intentionally, the ""B"" way. Not an ""A"" way you find out later was not up to the par you thought...you know that going in.Bad-butt authoritative actor Samuel L. Jackson, the unlikely choice for an ""action star"", was perfect in his role. An FBI agent assigned to escort an eye witness to a murdered vacationing Los Angeles DA by a ruthless cad, the cad finds a way to get rid of the eye witness by placing quite the arrangements of snakes on a plane on the red eye flight from Hawaii to Los Angeles. That's it in a nutshell. Snakes on a Plane. Scary snakes, or as explained in one of my favorite lines of the film ""snakes on crack"" - and the snakes ARE on crack which is why they are attacking everyone like crazy.Somewhat known, or unknown actors around him it kept the run of the film. You laughed, you screamed - but you had fun and was entertained. But this is what ""B"" films are for - you may be looking at future stars in the making in some cases. But most of all you were there to have a great time at the 'show'. Nothing more, nothing less.This film will remind you of what silly, mindless fun a 'B' horror film can be.",Snakes on a Plane
97,baumer,The most fun I've had the movies in ages!,10,24 April 2007,"I've always had this crazy theory that watching movies should be fun. Watching movies should be entertaining. Watching movies should an experience. Perhaps that's why I just don't like films such as Citizen Kane, Million Dollar Baby and Good Night and Good Luck. They may be well made but damn they are boring. Going into Snakes on a Plane, or SOAP, as the internet geeks like to refer to it, I knew exactly what I was getting into. I wasn't about to watch American Beauty or Crash. What I was about to watch was a film that looked like fun. It looked something that was made for the fans of such films and knowing that Samuel Jackson was going to spew some of his venomous diatribes (pun intended), I simply couldn't wait to see this. To say SOAP is entertaining is like saying it rains a lot in Vancouver. This is without a doubt the most fun I've had at the movies in years. The last time I felt this exhilarated watching a movie is maybe in Attack of the Clones when Yoda first ignites his lightsabre. This is fun, entertaining and made for the fans by people who actually care what we think. This is a dichotomy in theories comparing it to directors like Tarantino, who clearly make films for themselves. This is made for the fans.David Ellis (Final Destination 2) directs with a frenetic pace and uses the snakes in every way imaginable. The slithery killers do all the nastiest things possible to antagonize and ultimately kill as many passengers as possible. But not only do they kill, they slide up people's dresses, they come out of air ducts and go into people's eyes, they pop out of people's mouths and they are just nasty little thugs in the film. Think of all the evil gremlins in both films, and you have the snakes in here. They have personalities, just like Spike did, and they ultimately do enough mischievous things in here to ease some of the tension and turn it into humour. Snakes on a Plane never stops trying to entertain.Samuel Jackson plays Neville Flynn, who is in charge of bringing a witness from Hawaii to Los Angeles to testify against a crime boss. Together they board a plane that has hundreds of snakes loaded on board that have been sprayed with some kind of potion that turns them into bloodthirsty killers. Apparently snakes are supposed to be docile creatures unless provoked. This potion does plenty to provoke them, and like Nevile Flynn says in the film, ""Great, snakes on crack!"" There are all kinds of witty one liners like this one that culminates with Jackson sounding very Pulp Fiction like when he reaches his breaking point and yells, ""I've had it with these ***%^$#*** snakes on this **%$$#@@** plane!"" These lines and a few other scenes were added after the fact, when this film took a life of it's own on the internet. Samuel Jackson came back, recorded some additional lines for the film and the rest they say is history.I realize this film is a very hit and miss film. Many love it, many despise it. I don't really understand what there is to hate about it. It is fun and very entertaining. And what more can you ask for in a film? 10/10",Snakes on a Plane
98,sarastro7,"Holey rusted overrating, man!",4,2 September 2006,"The current rating of Snakes On A Plane - 7.8 (edit: thankfully it is now down to 6.1) - is completely out of touch with reality. The truth is that, even for what it is, namely a self-conscious, tongue-in-cheek, gratuitous B-movie, it's worth no more than a 5 out of 10 rating. The title is really the funniest thing about this movie. The story and the acting are neither inspired nor particularly funny, relying too much on cheap laughs of the kind we've seen ad nauseam before. There were many things to be disappointed about. That kick-boxer guy among the passengers, why does he never get into action? Why is there no showdown with the bad guys?? We just hear in the background that this Eddie Kim is under surveillance, and they casually mention ""picking him up"". Since we actually see a short early scene of Kim dishing out some kung fu moves, it seemed like a classic set-up for a martial arts showdown. Only it never materializes. WTF? Where's the proper ending of this movie? And I could go on about stupid things, plot holes and whatever, but frankly it's not worth the effort. This is the most typical form of Hollywood action mediocrity there is, and a perfect example of the culmination of an era where virtually no original, artistic or progressive movies are coming out of the major studios. They just flood the market with lowest common denominator drek that everyone can safely see, but that nobody particularly cares about.",Snakes on a Plane
99,mentalcritic,I must admit to being disappointed...,8,30 August 2006,"When I sat down in the theatre and waited for SOAP to roll, I expected the Earth to open up and swallow me. For I was led to believe, at least by the ridiculous amount of publicity on the Internet, that I was about to witness something unprecedented in Human history. I was about to witness a film that was so utterly bad that it was good, and had been made that way on purpose. What I got instead... well, let me put it this way. It was made the way it was on purpose, alright, but it was legitimately good. Not good in the same sense as RoboCop or The Godfather, mind you, but good in the sense that it kept me entertained for a hundred minutes, and the laughs were intentional. Now, I have some experience in films that are so bad they become good, as anyone who has read my user comments can attest. I even watched Double Dragon earlier the same day I went to see Snakes On A Plane. So yes, ladies and gentlemen, when I say they still have yet to make a Plan 9 type of film on purpose, I know from whence I speak.The premise in itself is a disaster waiting to happen. There's this plane, and it has snakes on it. And the snakes bite people. What makes this whole affair confounding is that the makers actually managed to make this a lot more interesting than it deserved to be. You can tell which scenes were filmed during principal photography and which were reshot in order to secure an American R rating. When Samuel Jackson makes his famous speech about how he's had enough of these blank snakes on this blank plane, it really does look like it was filmed six months after the rest of the scene. The weird thing is how, in spite of having so much footage added as a seeming afterthought, it all seems to come together anyway. Nobody is going to accuse SOAP of having high-minded motives like Glen Or Glenda? or Battlefield Earth did. It is a B-film, and not once during the lead up to its wide release did anyone involved pretend otherwise.So where did the bad film thing go wrong? First, they chose to give the leads some motivation. The story of how Nathan Phillips' character comes to be so hunted by the Chinese mafia that one of its bosses will risk an almost-certain death penalty to destroy him is one of the most tightly-shot action introductions, comparable to the likes of The Transporter for getting its point across. Nathan Phillips plays a regular guy who just wants to make it to the end alive, and Samuel Jackson plays a policeman who wants to make his ward survive even if it means shooting him. Byron Lawson plays the mostly-unseen villain of the piece so well that long before the introduction comes to an end, one hopes he is going to be skinned alive. That these three make one care enough about the characters to actually make the film interesting is one of SOAP's best achievements, and one that should not be underrated in this age of epic films with characters so thin that they would disappear if they turned sideways to the camera.A lot of the problem with how different the film is compared to expectations lies the film's nature. Samuel Jackson's agent apparently insisted that they change the title because Jackson allegedly could not work on a film with such a silly title. When Jackson heard about this, he insisted they change it back. And such is the confusion that seems to be at the heart of the matter. Jackson was apparently aware that they were making some kind of warped comedy. When you are doing a film that is apparently based upon a bet to see who can come up with the worst pitch for a film idea, the question is one of how you can possibly take the idea seriously. Yet take it seriously they did, and therein lies the problem. As a legitimate action film, SOAP is moderate entertainment. It would have been far more interesting as a comedy based on action-horror clichés. Or at least, it would have been more interesting as an exhibition of how much more warped the writers' sense of humour could get. I suspect the reportedly disappointing box office performance has a lot to do with how safe the actual film plays it.Does this make SOAP a total failure on the level of Resident Evil: Apocalypse? Thankfully, no. It is just sadly obvious that they started out aiming to make a middle of the road PG-13 film and changed their minds halfway through. Sure, it is a step in the right direction, far more so than starting with an R film and making it PG-13 halfway through the process, but changing one's mind halfway through always has mixed results. But the strange thing is that in spite of all the misguidance, Snakes On A Plane is in fact genuinely entertaining. Just not in the way that the hype and buzz on the Internet had led me to believe. So if you want to see a film that makes passing the better part of two hours seem like fun, you cannot go wrong here. Just please do not go in like I did, expecting the very fabric of the universe to invert on itself through the sheer power of the film's stupidity. Aside from a slight problem with explaining how the snakes got on the plane in the first place, the film is in fact rather clever.For those reasons, I am giving Snakes On A Plane an eight out of ten. It was made with no goal in mind other than entertainment, and for that reason alone it is worth seeing.",Snakes on a Plane
100,jaredmobarak,Snakes on crackSnakes on a Plane,2,6 January 2007,"OK, I know that the big deal with this film is that it should be seen in the theatres with a lot of kindred souls as a midnight attraction. When everyone is packed inside for a good time, maybe high/drunk, they can all hoop and holler and have an uproarious time with each other. Well, you see, this experience has nothing to do with the filmit has to do with the experience that night. I believe, whether or not I had seen it in the theatre and spent my hard earned $9.50 or not, I would come to the same conclusion that this was a horrible movie. For pure entertainment value it was not that bad for the beginning part and the initial onslaught of snakes. However, once the storyline went in the direction of saving those onboard from snake bites and a plane crash, the film turned away from its tongue-in-cheek-ness and tried to be serious. Here's a heads up to the filmmakers. If you choose to go the route of making an ""it's so bad it's good"" movie, stick to your guns and play up EVERYTHING for laughs. Don't copout midway and try to do something dramatic.Everyone knows the internet hype and the reshoots to add blood, sex, and language to the beef up a throw-away PG-13 flick to a throw-away R. Too bad the filmmakers didn't decide on making it R in the first place, because you can point out most instances of add-ins pretty easily. The famous Samuel L. Jackson line, (more famous before it even was added in the movie than afterwards), ""mofo snakes on my mofo plane"" is lit brighter and angled to reveal just his face. Luckily they had the same wardrobe to make the cut even resemble the previous and following shots. Also, I remember reading that there were real snakes used throughout the duration of filming with few CGI creations. Please show me a real snake though as almost every money-shot kill was so cartoonish you'd be looked at weird if you didn't laugh.I will give Sam Jackson some benefit of the doubt as he is the one person in this film that should be serious. He is the cool-head that will get them all through it and he should be in charge. I'll even buy Julianna Margulies for playing her character straight because she is the clichéd stewardess on her last flight and looking to keep as many of her wards alive. However, besides these two I would expect everyone else to ham it up. They should be having fun on screen and really play their parts for laughs against these two straight players. Unfortunately, most actually look like they think they are in a legitimate film. Rachel Blanchard, for example, is blatantly ripping off Paris Hilton, and doing so successfully at the start, but changes personalities at the midway mark into someone looking to survive and to help where needed. If she played the bimbo to the end, her character would have worked so much better. Props to Flex Alexander though, as he is the one person here who has some fun. The hyperchondriac rap superstar has so many ticks and eccentricities it is actually pretty funny. Even when he reaches his point for ""growth as a person"" he still keep the camp dial high with exaggerated facial expressions and speech. If only everyone else took a page from him I could have laughed some more and enjoyed my stay upon Pacific Air 121.Snakes on a Plane 3/10",Snakes on a Plane
101,Beta_Gallinger,"I decided to watch this with an open mind, but found that the title was not misleading",4,26 October 2010,"This movie got a lot of hype and was a box office hit back when it came into theatres four years ago. I guess that was around the time I first heard about the film and its ridiculous title. However, I never actually saw it until four years after its theatrical release and three years after I saw it sampled in the horrendous ""Epic Movie"". With a title like ""Snakes on a Plane"", it certainly doesn't sound like a very good movie, but a lot of people clearly like it. Knowing it had a following, I didn't just assume it was a terrible movie, and knew that watching it was very obviously going to be better than watching ""Epic Movie"". However, while it looked to me like it could be above average for a while, it didn't take long for it to drop to average and then at least slightly below! In Hawaii, a prosecutor is murdered by a gangster named Eddie Kim, and this killing is witnessed by a young man named Sean Jones, who finds that he has to run when the gangsters realize he saw the deed! He is rescued by an FBI agent named Neville Flynn, who tells Sean that he will have to do as he says if he wants to live! The witness is soon convinced to take a flight to Los Angeles and testify against Kim there. Sean and Neville both board an airplane with many other passengers, but nobody on board knows what horrible danger they're in for during the flight! Kim has gotten a time-release crate containing many different species of poisonous snakes into the cargo hold of the plane to try and make sure nobody makes it to Los Angeles alive to testify against him! A while after the flight begins, these snakes are released, so they are now free to slither around the plane and rapidly kill people, which is just what they do! At the beginning of this movie, it sure doesn't look like an action/thriller/horror movie, showing shots of Hawaii put to ""Lovely Day"", a song by Donavon Frankenreiter, but when this opening sequence is over, this immediately changes, showing the murder of the prosecutor. To me, the film looked at least slightly above average for just a little while, but this didn't last. First, there are some boring conversation scenes with dull characters, notably Claire Miller and Mercedes Harbont. The cast performances are mostly bland as well, apart from Samuel L. Jackson as Neville Flynn. Throughout the film, there are often parts I could tell are supposed to be funny, but these never made me laugh and VERY rarely made me smile. When the snakes are released and begin terrorizing the plane, I didn't find a lot of suspense, watching numerous people on board getting attacked by the snakes and the panic it causes. The story certainly tends to be predictable, and is also pretty stupid and absurd. Also, the CGI snakes are not exactly convincing. Even if all this cheesiness was intentional, I did not like it.Many fans of this movie might say that it is tongue-in-cheek and not meant to be taken seriously. That makes sense, since anyone who gives their movie a title like ""Snakes on a Plane"" shouldn't be aiming to make a serious film. Still, whether it's meant for suspense, laughs, or both, it fails if you ask me. Regardless of what the makers of this film intended it to be, one of the things it's obviously supposed to be is entertaining, and while many viewers can describe it as such, I most certainly cannot. Several years ago, I watched ""Mars Attacks!"" and thought it was really lame the first time, but then watched it again very shortly after that, realizing then that it was meant to be silly and campy, so it wasn't bad the second time. However, I somehow can't imagine a second viewing of this 2006 blockbuster changing my opinion significantly, even if it's a similar idea to the 1996 sci-fi comedy. I'm not going to insult the fan base ""Snakes on a Plane"" has managed to get, but don't expect me to become part of it.",Snakes on a Plane
102,vip_ebriega,'SoaP' opera.,5,5 July 2008,"My Take: With such a ridiculous premise, a few AIRPLANE-inspired mockery is called for. Thanks to the internet, SNAKES ON A PLANE, regardless of its reputations, has become more than just another B-movie with snakes... or is it? Considering the advertisements, the endless internet attractions and all the hype, SNAKES ON A PLANE (being advertised under the abbreviation SoaP) is a phenomenon. This is perhaps the only B-movie in history that is hyped this much high, right up there with other hyped blockbusters as the STAR WARS series. But in its heart, what made it so special? To me, this is ANACONDA all over again (although a little better of course!), only this time, the snakes are definitely on a plane. Despite a few occasionally edge-of-your-seat moments, a few deliciously campy spots and a decent lead in Samuel L. Jackson, SoaP is a film much too far from the promise of its hype.Before the movie ever came out, the studio must make sure they rank this one a hit, considering the fact that who would want to see a movie about, well, snakes on a plane. Even before the movie began, the film created an enormous sensation on the internet, greeted with eventual cult fans who threw in every single bit of storyline or character that they can possibly think of. Despite the already crowded story bits coming from its fans, the screenwriters felt they needed a screenplay to fit the film. Actually, they never faired better than the fanatics, as they throw in as much clichés than a 70's disaster epic. One screenwriters says ""Let's make that snake bite this."" While the other says ""Let's make that guy do that."" The story is something that the late producer Irwin Allen (aka ""Master of Disaster"") rise from his grave and cheer. If the silly premise of snakes on a plane enough, the film also embraces as much disaster movie clichés as possible. It's got it all, whether the plane is left unmanned, a hole in the plane which has the passengers dangling for dear life or even the chances that one of the passengers able to fly the plane whose sole flight experience... is playing his Playstation! Other than that, we also get a bunch of cookie-cutter cut-out characters, each with their own bit of ""personalities"". Samuel ""Action Jackson"" L. Jackson plays tough-mouthed cop Neville Flynn, who escorts a witness (Nathan Philips) so he can testify against a crime boss for murder. To stop them, the boss dispatches a plane load of deadly snakes. And this plane is filled with these sorry innocent passengers of course, complete with a Paris Hilton-esquire dog lover (Rachael Blanchard), two flight attendants (Juliana Margulies and Sunny Mabrey), a rap star (Flex Alexander), his brother (Kenan Thompson), a bunch of kids (of course) and a bad love-to-hate businessman (Gerard Plunkett).Other than a few exciting moments (the climax was well-executed) and for some of its camp value (among which is the memorable title), SNAKES ON A PLANE is a silly film that's does itself wrong when it was hyped to the heavens. While the film never took itself too seriously other than its tongue-in-cheek approach, SoaP an over-hyped film that apparently, has very little to boast for. Still, you could do better in this than see any of the two ANACONDA films.Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",Snakes on a Plane
103,jon.h.ochiai,The Title Alone,8,20 August 2006,"""Snakes on a Plane."" The beauty of the movie is that no one has to ask: Now what is the movie about? No doubt that ""Snakes on a Plane"" will win ""Best Movie"" at next year's MTV Movie Awards. The movie title and the fact that Samuel L. Jackson stars drew me to the theater. ""Snakes on a Plane"" has tough guy FBI Agent Samuel L. Jackson rattling off four letter words, Asian gang killers, quality gratuitous nudity, and of course snakes on a plane. Part of the mythology of this movie is that Jackson agreed to make the movie solely on the basis of the title. A wise choice. Director David R. Ellis's ""Snakes on a Plane"" is preposterous and ridiculous; however, it is fun to watch and everyone plays it straight. Camp is a given here. The screenplay by John Heffernan and Sebastian Gutierrez cleverly contexts the story and diverts our attention involving a witness protection transport all as an excuse for ""Snakes on a Plane"".In Hawaii Sean (Nathan Phillips), young extreme sports guy, witnesses the brutal murder of a Los Angeles DA by ruthless crime lord Eddie Kim (brooding Byron Lawson). Kim cognizant of the witness sends his men to kill Sean. Fortunately, FBI Agent Neville Flynn (super cool Samuel L. Jackson) gets to Sean first. He tells Sean, ""Do what I say and you live."" Clear enough instructions. Sean reluctantly agrees to testify against Kim. So Neville and his partner accompany Sean on-board an airline flight to Los Angeles. Evoking a little known FAA policy, they take over all of First Class. This is just one of the headaches for head flight attendant Claire (Julianna Margulies) on her last flight-- she is leaving to pursue a career as a lawyer. The flight leaves Honolulu along with a cargo of deadly snakes, poised to strike. Writers Heffernan and Gutierrez definitely earn creative points, because no movie has done anything close to this before. The next logical question is: Sequel? Heffernan and Gutierrez in fuse some flavor and atmosphere into their action movie. On board the flight, we have rapper Three G's (Flex Alexander) and his boys (Kenan Thompson and Keith Dallas), elitist Mercedes (Rachal Blanchard) and her annoying dog, kick boxer Chen (Terry Chen), and young flight attendant Tiffany (Sunny Mabrey). All havoc breaks loose as the snakes commence their assault. A memorable scene includes a vicious attack to a man urinating in the cabin lavatory. Yikes. Also a ""mile high"" tryst turns venomous. ""Snakes on a Plane"" also has an ear for pop culture. Where else do you get, ""Praise PlayStation 2."" Through it all, Samuel L. Jackson is the Man. As agent Flynn he is at his tough guy best, and unrestrained by last year's Jedi dialog he is his bad ass self. He is cool and charismatic. So is Julianna Margulies. As Claire she is strong, smart, and sexy. Jackson and Margulies are a great team. Nathan Phillips as Sean has good chemistry with Jackson. Their epilogue is very cool. As for the snakes, they are killer. The mayhem directed by Ellis is spectacularly bloody. ""Snakes on a Plane"" is over the top and completely entertaining. After all it does have a great title.",Snakes on a Plane

FBI agent Nelville Flynn is on the plane with him to protect him. Little does anybody know that snakes have been boarded on this flight and once they get out all hell breaks loose and it is up to Nelville and the passengers to save themselves and each other. Snakes On A Plane has been one of the most talked about movies of the summer. I remember months ago that movie message boards were crowded with postings about this movie and how awesome people thought it would be. The studio bought into this and made a lot more promotional material available to fans and even had a late screening the day before the film opened because many thought it would be the top grossing film of the summer. Many also thought it would be the next big cult classic, but with a small opening weekend gross the film seemed to disappoint at the box office and unless it picks up some more viewers it won't make all that much money. Because of all the hype and relatively good reviews I was looking forward to this film being a campy fun film like the drive in films you would see in the 60's and 70's. I was kind of disappointed. The film was entertaining, but there just wasn't an awful lot to this film other than people running around on a plane trying to get rid of these snakes. I realize however that this is what the trailers and everything would lead you to believe happens in the film, but it just wasn't as entertaining or even funny enough to make me really like this film. I figured the film would be in the category that it is so bad it is good with enough unintentional laughs to make this film really fun, but the film never really delivered that. It was entertaining enough at times, but at other times I felt maybe it went on a bit too long and the material was getting old. I must commend the filmmakers though for making this an R rated film because without the R rated material this film would have really stank if it was say PG-13. After hearing all the hype and reading the mostly good reviews I sat in the theatre hoping to see the next cult classic, but it just didn't happen. This film seems to still be popular with a limited audience, so it could still be a hit with some people, but it just didn't do a whole lot for me and I guess my expectations were a little too high. I'am however giving the film a slight recommendation on the level that it didn't bore me and that was a little bit of entertainment to be had, but overall this film was a disappointment.",Snakes on a Plane
105,krorie,Snake Eyes,3,10 January 2007,"What should have been an exciting action flick filled with dynamic entertaining special effects turns out to be a complete bore with cheesy computer graphics that make many a B movie look big budget in comparison. Even the humor, which is supposed to be tongue-in-cheek of the ""Lake Placid"" variety, falls flat. The snake going for the penis elicits only a chuckle rather than the intended cackle. Ditto for the snake crawling around the fat woman's boobs inside her dress. The only scene that actually turns out as funny as intended is the bathroom scene where the couple getting it on are attacked by the reptiles. When the middle-aged woman hearing the commotion comments on the guy's virility but then retracts her statement when the believed orgasm comes to a deadly halt is well timed and works.Even the marvelous actor Samuel L. Jackson comes up short delivering a performance that is copied from his Jules Winnfield character of ""Pulp Fiction"" fame. What is appropriate for one film is not necessarily appropriate for another. He does play his part for laughs but the script and direction let him down.Perhaps the worst part of the movie turns out to be the snakes themselves, the ones who are supposed to be the stars of the show.

Seriously ""sneaking"" a 6 metre Anaconda or python/ whatever through an airport and on to a passenger liner? Forget about the hundreds of other garden variety venomous serpents.) In all honesty, it probably needed to be funnier than it ended up being. What's always surprised me about this movie, is that it seems to be one those ""Guilty Pleasures"" an uncomfortably, large group of hardened, experienced film critics 'fess up to owning.

The horror is very much of the comic book variety and I actually found the film quite amusing. Jackson is nowhere near as over the top as I thought he would be. He's still very much on cruise control in the role though. The plot of the film is more Auston Powers than anything else and even though I really dislike snakes it didn't give me any nightmares. By far the best character is the miserable old git that gets bumped from 1st class.

I laughed while watching snakes, normally rather retiring, earthbound, slow-witted, torpid creatures, suddenly gifted with the ability to organize among the themselves, gang up on humans, and fly through the air to overpower their much larger, and supposedly smarter, prey. Given that humans are equipped with opposable thumbs, it's amazing how many of them can't fight off the completely unbelievable ""snakes on crack"" in this movie.There are scenes designed to please gore-hungry teens, including snakes biting, and swinging off of, every sensitive body part imaginable, including eyeballs and other parts I can't mention here.And it offers scenes that are genuinely scary, if only for moments.Samuel L. Jackson gives an amazing performance. He never gives in to the campiness of the movie, and plays it completely straight. The self control he exhibits here should earn him a special Academy Award.As you know if you've read the internet buzz around the movie, generated by its ridiculously hammy title, Jackson's most vaunted line in the movie is, ""I'm tired of these (expletive deleted) snakes on this (expletive deleted) plane."" I, with the rest of the audience, kept waiting and waiting for this line -- is he going to say it now? Now? When he finally does say it, he says it for all its worth. Jackson could be at the Alamo, for all the force and gravity he gives the line. It's amazing.I had fun at this movie, but I hoped for more. ""Snakes,"" given the internet buzz it aroused, is a cultural phenomenon, and I hoped for just a tad more creativity, risk taking, surprises, memorable moments I couldn't wait to describe to friends.And, other than Jackson's performance, there really weren't any bold flourishes here. It's just what you'd expect -- a cheesy knock-off of a disaster flick, with the usual diverse ""ship of fools"" characters we've been looking at since all-star cast movies like ""Dinner at Eight"" -- except that there are no stars here. In lieu of stars, you have a character based on Sean Combs, and another based on Paris Hilton.

Ellis, is the latest film purported to be the next cult film (some even say another ""Rocky Horror Picture Show""). And it very well may be. One thing I liked about this movie was its original concept - to have snakes on a plane! And it's great to see Samuel L. Jackson enjoying himself in the FBI Agent role (look out for the classic ""I've had enough . . . !"" line!).However, that said, there were many flaws, including the ""scary scenes"" which turned out to be unintentionally hilarious - because honestly, can you really see snakes on a plane as a realistic plot? I couldn't. But being funny isn't a bad thing either, and this can definitely be the next cult comedy horror.Also, the ending was somewhat muted. You have to see to understand - let's just say that landing a plane takes more than learning a video game.Regardless, go see the film (and stay for the end credits music video with a cameo by a Jedi Master!).

111,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Hmmm....,5,23 April 2008,"An idea that involves a group of snakes terrorizing a plane can only start as a joke. That was one of the supposed origins of this film - a group of producers decide to pitch ideas after a few drinks. So it began as a joke and it ends like one too. That's not wholly a bad thing, but it is not wholly a good thing either.The film demonstrates many examples of carelessness and Hollywood greed. Itwas initially made as a PG-13 thriller but due to massive internet popularity (mainly in the form of parodies) studio executives gave extra money and time to shoot additional scenes that would bring it up to an R rating. They figured the film was already essentially marketed and would rake in profits. Unfortunately, many of these additional scenes seem literally stitched right into the film. Samuel L. Jackson's famous line about ""these motherf***ing snakes"" is in a shot that is so obviously just inserted in that it is embarrassing. There are also many indicators that the film started as a serious (or an attempt at a serious) thriller, but due to the online parodies, it was turned into a comedy of sorts. The result is a movie that simply doesn't know what it wants to be. It is funny in parts, but it doesn't really work either way. The suspense is rather flimsy and given the slithering set of villains on a large aircraft (admittedly something new) that is a very big disappointment.Finally a newer than average thriller idea is born, but it is not taken to any new lengths or truly inventive scenarios of tension. In fact, the part of the film that takes place on the place is the only new thing, due to the snakes, but the whole setup and conclusion are hardly original. Look at it like an inferior remake of ""Midnight Run"" with snakes. Enjoyable in parts, but in the end it just ends up being a mediocre parody of itself. --- 5/10Rated R for violence and profanity.

Pre-release online fanbase rapidly increases hype, studio rides wave of hype for all it's worth, movie falls way short of most expectations... pretty similar to most any internet-savvy, young, nerdy male demographics dealing with the hype machine, only with Snakes on a Plane, this excitement mutated beyond anyone's expectations. No one was more surprised to see just how many American youths were beginning to salivate in anticipation of Samuel Jackson and his frightening battle with a legion of snakes above the skies then the studio themselves. Many net-heads touted Snakes as being the next great B-movie, gawking over the dizzying amount of photos depicting our hero strangling these slithery suckers. It turned out, at least for most that did not convince themselves already beforehand, that this movie rolled out to be quite mediocre. Entertaining? Perhaps, but not nearly enough in that bad=good manner everyone had seemingly been expecting. Which leads to Snakes other main problem: suffering from this split identity that uneasily shifts between a straightforward, even morally tinged action comedy, and the goofy, seldomly pleasurable kitsch it obviously tacked on after getting wind of what fans were expecting. Jackson plays the role he loves to play, still banking on that wide-eyed stare and loud, commanding demeanor that has guided him throughout the past with much greater characters. Evidentally, the genius who cast this plane full of snakes with Sam knew a good marketing combination when he saw one, understanding that content is something better analyzed in retrospect of your ticket admission.",Snakes on a Plane

At that time my dad liked to watch throwaway horror animal movies like snakes, dinosaurs, alligators, and lions. Most of them scared me back then. I didn't finish this movie, but I still remembered scenes that spooked me. So I decided to watch again.It's alright. I already expected a throwaway movie, so I won't go hard on the negatives. Most of the characters were exaggerated and hilarious. Dialogues were cringe and also hilarious, especially when David Koechner said them.I didn't realize that the cast was pretty stacked. Also, the movie was surprisingly entertaining. I guess watching a bunch of bad CGI snakes biting people was fun. The best was easily the long python squeezing and swallowing a dude, and I wished that scene would last longer.Overall, it's a fun throwaway movie with a ridiculous premise.

Okay, the only problem is, it's not trashy enough. The only really stupid thing about the project is the title. Everything else is basically your average throw-away Hollywood action movie with B-movie actors and one star who has a serious problem picking the right scripts. That said, ""Snakes On A Plane"" isn't that horrible, either. If you accept the fact that this is a no brainer - and knowing the title you probably will - you're in for 90 relatively entertaining minutes. Just not as unintentionally funny as you might have been lead to believe. In fact, the producers' conscious effort to promote this as a ""so bad, it's good""-movie prevents it from being just that and at the end of the day what you get is just ""Snakes On A Plane"".",Snakes on a Plane

118,Isaac5855,A Surprisingly Effective little Thriller....,7,29 August 2007,"SNAKES ON A PLANE is a campy, far-fetched, yet effective little thriller that will hold your attention. This is the story of an Asian gangster named Eddie Kim who decides to take out the only witness to his murder of a prominent LA district attorney. When Kim feels he has exhausted all other options, he decides to take care of the witness by filling the plane that is flying the witness back to LA to testify, with thousands of deadly poisonous snakes. Then the plane's air filtration system is filled with a gas that triggers the snakes' aggression so what we have, as the main character states, is ""snakes on crack."" If you can accept that this Kim character had no other options and was able to arrange this in a matter of days and that this many snakes don't bite every single person on the plane, then some suspense, scares, and even laughs can be had here. This film reminded me of POLTERGEIST, in that, as much as it tries to scare you, it never loses its sense of humor either. The screenplay is constructed with its tongue well tucked into its proverbial cheek as it not only creates suspense, scares, and produces some genuinely ""gross"" moments, there is a camp quality to the execution of the story that allows you to accept the lapses in logic. The performances range from sincere to overblown with Samuel L. Jackson utilizing his enormous screen appeal to the nth degree as the no-nonsense FBI agent escorting the witness who becomes our reluctant hero. Juliana Marguilies manages to keep a straight face as the head stewardess and SNL's Keenan Thompson provides comic relief as a passenger who steps up in time of crisis.

So many folks said it was a cheezey, rollicking, so-bad-it's-good kind of summer movie. What Americans used to call a wonderful 'Drive-In' movie. But for me, it was just bad. And I'm not complaining about the illogical plot, nor the implausible and goofy stunts and events. In those kind of movies, the ones you really enjoy, even though they may not be all that great in terms of film, or art--- they nonetheless have a quality to them that permits you to lose yourself in them to a degree. Or at least 'believe', in the sense that you could get caught up in it, as goofy as it is. 'Snakes' is just dull. Everyone was unlikeable. I kind of wanted the whole cast to die, the characters were so annoying (not the real human actors, I wish them all well, and better luck in their next acting, or waitressing, jobs). But the snakes and the deaths and the 'peril' in this movie were not in the least interesting. And that's this movie's greatest sin--- not stupidity, not that it's illogical--- but simply IT IS BORING. Yawn... Zzzzzz.....Stay away from this butt-number, and instead rent 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventures', or 'Big Trouble in Little China', or even one of the recent Star Wars offerings, if you're into Samuel L.

121,DonFishies,"An action-packed, fun-filled extravaganza",8,27 August 2006,"Maybe it was the concept of the film. Maybe it was one of my favourite actors, Samuel L. Jackson, starring in it. Maybe it was just the title itself, Snakes on a Plane. For whatever the reason was, I needed to see this film. Months of hype and countless articles surrounding the film came and went, as did an all too short teaser trailer. Finally the movie arrived, and did not do nearly as well as expected. But this supposed ""bomb"" turned out to be one of the best films of the summer, and in the kindest way possible, has already become and will only further cement itself as a cult classic.The film opens casually and calmly enough, with serene images of Hawaii over the fairly tranquil opening credits. After they conclude, Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) just happens to walk in on a brutal murder perpetrated by the infamous mobster Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson). He flees, and does not bother telling anyone. So just before an assassination attempt on his life, Sean is saved by FBI Agent Neville Flynn (Jackson). He takes him to FBI headquarters and convinces him to be a witness in a trial against Kim in Los Angeles. The only way to get to LA is by plane, and I am absolutely certain everyone can guess where the film goes from here.That is the basic summary of the plot, and the film stays straight-forward through the rest of the proceeding moments. Of course, the set-up feels a bit stretched, but it successfully made the film feel more proper in the real sense, than it would have had it just jumped right to the titular snakes. I was prepared for a totally ridiculous movie short on plot, but was in vein of being so bad it was good. But instead, the film is actually fairly good, with a decent plot and tons of campy cheese sprinkled all over it. Does that make it any worse? Of course not, it only makes the film more fun.But if you are prepared for the fun the film brings, you absolutely need to be in the right mindset. There is some pretty bleak black comedy here, and tons of outrageously obscene violence. In some instances, the film is absolutely terrifying at the exact same time it is genuinely hilarious. And once it picks up with this barrage of violence and comedy, it does not let up. These fun elements of the film just keep coming at the audience, and for those who can find the merits to enjoy it, you are in for a great time. While the characters may be serious, the film almost never takes itself seriously, which is a great thing.If there is anything I can see wrong with it at all, it is the fact that it does not feel like a totally R-rated film. I know the film was created for PG-13, but I think even before the entirety of the SoaP phenomenon hit, New Line should have touted it for the R. The violence is totally amped up, but the way the characters talk still feels a bit toned down. I expected it, but it kind of detracts from what the film could have been had New Line just gone with their gut and not waited for a whole fanbase to create and almost demand the retakes.Even though you would not think it in such a film, the acting is fairly well done. Jackson is at his bad-ass best with Flynn. Yeah, some of his lines are a bit wacky, but he delivers them with such finesse and seriousness that he shows why he is the resident Hollywood BMF (and yes, the ""line"" is one of the best parts in the entire film). But while Jackson holds his own, I cannot help but contend that while feeling a bit held back by the original rating, the plethora of supporting characters take away from him too.Collectively, they all get their own story lines and motivations, and have a whole lot more screen time than Jackson. And while the filmmakers have used a lot of archetypal and stereotypical characters. Of course, mentioning all of them kind of ruins the zest and fun of each individual character, but do note that they are all not entirely one-dimensional. And the ones that are, are still used far better than most films. I will says that Phillips, Julianna Margulies, Kenan Thompson, David Koechner, Bobby Cannavale and Todd Louiso are particular standouts in the very diverse supporting cast.And of course, there are the snakes. I have read that some are CGI and some are real, but will you be able to tell the difference? Only when they really start attacking individual characters. They are so well constructed and so realistic looking, that only up to the moments of individual attack do you have absolutely no idea what is real and what is not. They all look great on screen, and all of the attack effects, save for a few really cheesy shots, look great on screen. The snake-vision sequences are the only thing that I really did not like about them. They just do not seem to really work, and are way too cheesy for their own good.In the end, the fairly ridiculous film on paper, is actually not all that bad. It is much better than I expected it would be, and is definitely one of my favourite films of the summer. It is action-packed, fun, and does not take itself totally seriously (unlike a certain box office behemoth from last month). It already is a cult classic, but its staying power will only become greater in the years to come.8/10.",Snakes on a Plane

I decided to add it to my watchlist, but I never actually found the time to see it until recently. This is something I regret. I'm glad I finally seen the movie. I had to rent it. The name of the movie couldn't be any clearer. Basically, there are snakes on board along with people on a flight to LA (Los Angeles). There's a disaster waiting to be happened. The snakes have been deliberately put on board to kill a witness. Can the passengers survive? Can they make it? You need to see the movie to find out. I enjoyed the movie. I think it's worth at least seven stars which is a good rating. It's terrific watching it for the first time if you haven't already seen it. It's a dangerous and lengthy ride for the passengers on board. ""Snakes on a Plane"" is an action, adventure, crime and thriller movie. It's exciting! It thrills you all the way to the end. The movie quickly gets into action once the movie starts. I thought the start was breathtaking! I've never seen a start quite like that. I really enjoyed the first thirty minutes of the movie. It's like a build-up. I like the FBI agent called Neville Flynn. This is a guy who's in control. He's taking on a gang of sociopaths led by Eddie Kim. He's protecting a witness, and needs to take him on a plane to testify against Eddie. What they don't know is that a disaster is waiting to happen inside the plane. They have unwelcome visitors. The character was played by Samuel L. Jackson. I thought he was perfect for the role. He's probably the main character. Another character I really want to discuss about is Troy. He was played by Kenan Thompson who is famous for the Nickelodeon show called ""Kenan and Kel"". He played a big part in the movie right towards the end. I still liked that he had a part to play though it's only minor. ""Snakes on a Plane"" would've failed without Kenan Thompson and Samuel L. Jackson. They made the movie exciting to watch. I'm surprised Kenan is not involved in more movies - he's a funny actor. Anyway, there were many snakes. They were all deadly and venomous. The people on board have to work together in order to survive; they have to fight these snakes. ""Snakes on a Plane"" is totally worth it. I'm surprised it has over a 1,000 reviews.

But I think any more sensible member of the general public will tell you that SOAP is nothing more than a mildly competent action movie. It's not hysterically funny. It's not scary. It's occasionally exciting. And it sure ain't a ""10"" on the IMDb scale.Don't misunderstand me; I had fun watching the movie. I was even willing to be generous, until I saw the outrageously high rating on this site and all the strangely gushing reviews. Frankly, I'm a bit astonished. Why heap such praise on this particular film? If you love camp, over-the-top action movies, then why not worship a camp action film that's actually good? (""Wrath of Khan"" springs to mind - also ""Batman."") The truth is that parts of SOAP are pretty lame. Samuel L. Jackson is good, but his role is weirdly small. And, aside from his one power catchphrase, most of his dialog is banal and dull. The rest of the actors aren't even worth commenting on, since they're stuck with stock and boring ""funny"" characters.Speaking of dull, how many different ways can snakes really kill someone? They hiss...they lunge...they bite...over and over and over again. It's not particularly cinematic. And most of them are fake CGI anyway, so they're not even remotely frightening.Face it, the only reason to see this is because it's camp and bad. It's part of the whole culture of worshiping lame junk that's prevalent right now. It's hip to like terrible garage bands and lame movies because people are either too impatient, or too unsophisticated, to take the time to absorb entertainment that's actually artistic. So we watch and listen to junk, and imagine that we're superior to it, and that makes us feel good. Apparently. Is there anything wrong with liking junk?

There are bites to the neck, chest, eye, penis, breast and butt. People get crushed, impaled and stabbed. There is a sex scene with a tad bit of nudity, nothing brilliant.

125,Antagonisten,Surprisingly good,6,4 January 2007,"I didn't know what to think when i decided to watch ""Snakes on a Plane"". It's hard to know whether it will be a fun ride or a complete disaster (like so many other horror movies today).So, what's the verdict? Well, it's not a disaster, actually i kind of liked the movie. But it's not a fun ride either, the comedy factor is actually pretty much non-existent. Instead we have something closer to a hardcore horror movie. It's both brutal and gruesome at times and presented in a mostly humorless way. I was actually surprised at the level of gore and violence in the movie, i expected it to be more along the lines of a horror-comedy. I guess the comedy lies more in the choice of title, the rather over-descriptive title ""Snakes on a Plane"" which states more or less exactly what the movie is about in a very blunt way.The cast is pretty decent with the dependable Samuel L. Jackson headlining. The premise of the movie works pretty well and the horror scenes inside the aircraft are also pretty well made. The special effects are a mixed bowl, some of them are rather lame with the obvious ""too-smoth-for-reality""-movement that computer generated animals tend to have. The story itself feels more or less like an excuse to get the snakes on the plane, but i guess that works too.So is it scary? Well, not many horror movies are very scary in my opinion and this is more of a shock-type horror film than anything, and as such it works pretty well. What surprised me most is perhaps the unsettling feeling the movie has. Since we are early on introduced to the fact that this is going to be a gruesome movie, we learn to expect rather messy deaths. That, if nothing else, creates a feeling that anything (probably something very horrible) might happen at any time. Which is not a bad thing for a horror movie.In the end this movie is a surprisingly decent horror movie that lives off one decent idea. Sometimes i guess an idea is enough and this works rather well. I recommend it to those without a weak stomach or a snake-phobia that is too big. It has a very unrealistic ending as well, but that is something i'm willing to accept, after all it's just a movie. 6/10.",Snakes on a Plane

NO! this snake would have been killed stone dead by that shock.Call that mistake 4.The fact that the snakes manage to get from the sealed hold into any of the electrical systems (totally unlikely even if things were left open). The writers clearly didn't do much research into the planes layout (the electrical breaker bay under the cockpit that doesn't exist and isn't there, for 1 huge mistake making that number 5) they wouldn't get into the air conditioning or oxygen mask areas.Half the snakes attack with no provocation, even with the pheromone, snakes would not attack such a large target like a human.

Jackson thriller. Although it failed to create a fantastic film, it defiantly produced a fun and enjoyable film. Sam Jackson plays the type of character we all love to see him play, and delivers some wonderful lines. The supporting cast are also wonderful and really seem to fit into the action. The only probably I really had from this film, is the disappointing CGI snakes. The CGI plane was fantastic, but unfortunately the snakes did not look realistic at all. They defiantly needed more work on. The story won't win any awards for writing, but it is definitely a joy to sit through and watch Samuel L. Jackson work his magic.Oh, Lord  Grace (Lin Shaye)",Snakes on a Plane
131,ebeckstr-1,"Write a headline for your review. Ok, done",5,14 November 2021,"Well, I finally broke down and watch this movie after avoiding it for 15 years and seeing it referenced repeatedly in pop culture. The one thing snakes on a plane has going for it is its awareness of its own unadulterated absurdity. It is supposed to be funny and occasionally is. It is supposed to be over the top and it is never anything but. It's problems include David Koechner, who plays the same exact a-hole character in everything he's in, mediocre and sometimes verging on poor CG, and that it degrades women and gay men even more than your average sexist, homophobic movie from this century. It is also replete with sexually themed snake attacks, which some segments of viewers will find hilarious, but which I found obvious and crude. I suppose the two guys who wrote the script just couldn't resist.So, this is not a good movie. But on a certain level it is passibly entertaining if you can get into the spirit of things; plus, there's the surprising bonus that none of the black characters die, and none of them sacrifice their life for a bunch of white folk. An achievement, by the standards of this movie!",Snakes on a Plane
132,iohefy-2,A little disappointing.,6,16 March 2007,"I have wanted to see this movie since I saw the coming attractions a ways back at another preview. I rented the DVD and I must say that I was rather disappointed with the finished project. I enjoy the work of Samuel L. Jackson in most everything I have seen him in, but I don't know what he was thinking when he signed up for this movie. The story started out to be reasonable, but as we got the the airplane scenes it ran way with the snake idea. I would imagine that the screen writer was overcome with the snake idea as there were snakes coming from everywhere and the scenes were never ending. After a short while of watching these scenes I finally gave up and shut my DVD player off and although not seen knew that all aboard would land up safely in California after there snaky flight from Hawaii.",Snakes on a Plane

The CGI isn't very realistic, but it was good enough to make the hair stand up on my arm, and at one point, I jumped in my seat! And it's a heck of a lot bloodier than I thought it would be! Those snakes sure pick a lot of awful place on the body to bite! Yeesh! Samuel L. is awesome as always, and he delivers that 'famous' line just like he was born to do!

On the subject of which, the movie this most reminds me of is SPEED. There's the same breathless pace. But the earlier movie has much less gratuitous nastiness, maybe because there are fewer passengers on a bus than on a jet plane. So yeh, I enjoyed this movie in spite of its pathetic macho posturing, its tits/cock/ass obsessions and in particular its desperate homophobia (certainly makes you ponder whether the screenwriters have problems with themselves?).

136,theshadow908,Absolutely ridiculous...But the most fun I've ever had in a theater.,7,19 August 2006,"Snakes on a Plane tells the story of a young man who witnesses a murder committed by a feared Asian mob boss. FBI agent Neville Flynn comes to the rescue, and brings the young man on board a flight to L.A, so he can testify against the mobster. Unfortunately, the mobster has stuck dozens of poisonous snakes on the plane, and they are released once the plane is up in the air. Now they are attacking everything and anything they can on board, just in the hopes that one young man will be killed. Now it's up to Neville Flynn to save the flight.The concept of this movie is utterly ridiculous. In a day and age where toothpaste and hairspray aren't even allowed on the plane, we're expected to believe that the mafia can sneak foreign poisonous snakes on board? I don't think so folks. When I was asked if I wanted to go see this movie, I went just for something to do. I was certain I would be let down. I was dead wrong! This is so far the most fun I've had at a movie this year. Sure the story and the concept and obviously the title sound like a TBS Superstation original movie, but when you see it, you'll think differently. What I liked is it didn't try to be anything more than it is. It is a corny action film akin to the disaster movies of the 70's. That's all. I know it won't win any Oscars, but it sure did entertain me. The action scenes, the humour, the death scenes, all of them perfect. The best part of the movie, and of the night, was when Samuel L. Jackson screams ""I've had it with these mutha@#%&in' snakes on this mutha@#%&in' plane!"" The entire audience in the theater clapped and cheered.Of course, Sam Jackson is the only actor in this movie of any real credibility, and MAYBE Juliana Margulies, but otherwise, the acting isn't great. But who cares?! I'm not here to see great actors in a character driven movie. I'm here to see Sam Jackson lay his vengeance upon the asses of those mutha@#%&in' snakes on a plane! 7.5/10",Snakes on a Plane

How did they get there you ask? Well a mob informer is on the plane on his way to testify, and the bad guys know this is one way they can get to their man. On the plane though is one man not afraid of a battle, Neville Flynn (Jackson).Soon after take off the snakes are released by means of a timer, and due to pheromones released in their environment, they're very aggressive. Passengers start to drop like flies and the infrastructure of the plane also falls victim to the snakes. Will Flynn be able to protect his witness and save the plane and the bulk of it's passengers? If you'd heard any of the impact bloggers had on some scenes, you'd be prepared for some crazy scenarios, of which there are several. In fact the first few deaths almost made me turn off. There are some great scenes, and the movie never takes itself seriously, but unfortunately besides Jackson, no-one else really bought anything to the table (except of course the snakes). There was room for plenty more laughs and plenty more thrills.",Snakes on a Plane

Wanting Sean to testify against Eddie Kim, Flynn flies Sean to LA, though Kim puts a spanner in the works. Kim has the plane flying Flynn and Sean filled with hundreds of different, highly poisonous snakes.As a somewhat anomaly, Snakes on a Plane had huge, stressing huge here, cult status, and a catch line nobody has heard, even before its release. The sheer concept of Snakes on a Plane is blatantly moronic, filling a plane with snakes to kill one man, you wonder who green lit the project. Snakes on a Plane is no A grade horror/thriller, nor is it a B grade romp like Slither, no Snakes on a Plane is straight up, trashy C grade film making at its very best.Snakes on a Plane does every wrong thing in a film; terrible dialog, bad acting, dodgy special effect, loud soundtrack for scares, and an inconceivably dumb plot, but director David R. Ellis makes all this work; much like his effort on Final Destination 2. Yes he knows what he's making and doesn't say it's anything else. With no hint of any seriousness, Snakes on a Plane is just pure entertainment. It basically is it's so bad, actually terrible, it's good. The cringe factor at how stupid this is, harmoniously runs with the constant laughs of excitement. Elobarte deaths and overly, over the top violence, with a never ending run of people dropping like flies; it's just a barrel of fun.Loving every second in his role, Samuel L. Jackson shows he's having a ball, even behind his serious face. Julianna Margulies is also good as stewardess Claire.

143,Quicksand,The 'Citizen Kane' of Movies about Snakes on Planes,8,21 December 2006,"The movie studio got all giddy last year, when they mistook the extreme internet buzz about this movie, for people actually being interested in seeing the movie. They failed to realize-- too late-- that the buzz was for the title, not the actual thing. ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" is a great title, too. Let's try and keep some perspective.Despite this, as far as original concepts go, you could do worse. Negative comments on the IMDb range from the idiotic (""What a stupid title!"" ... duh), to the obvious (""This is a bad movie."" ... also, duh). What we had here was a title so bad it had to be good, assuming you got the joke. I mean, come ON... it's SNAKES on a PLANE. Wouldn't you pay eight bucks to see some snakes on a plane? You wouldn't? Then shut up. You all paid to see ""Terrorists on a High Rise,"" (Die Hard) and ""White People on a Boat,"" (Titanic) so let us have our fun. We're not hurting anyone.The plot is simple: gangster sets a timer on a crate of snakes, in the hold of a plane as it flies a witness from Hawaii to Los Angeles. Mayhem ensues.Really, at that point, the film becomes a showcase for the inherent coolness of Samuel L. Jackson. He takes charge, he shouts, he shoots at snakes. No one else involved with the film is really that special, though if you had to note anyone, it would be Julianna Margulies (they should have spent some of the FX budget on getting her face to move), Keenan Thompson (who can even make the word ""Hello"" funny), and That Guy, the nanny from Jerry Maguire, as a snake expert.The studio wanted a PG-13 movie, but internet buzz changed their mind. Trouble is, by this point, they'd already hired David Ellis, who is a former stuntman and directs just like one. Previous efforts were, in total, ""Final Destination 2"" and ""Cellular."" I think we can all agree, the death scenes of the former were cool, and that's all he's got going for him. Which is exactly what he brings to ""Snakes on a Plane."" There's little character development; there's no rhyme or reason for who dies, or when, and the entire movie is shot like a TV-movie of the week. Sure, it's fine if you want to make out in the back row of the theater, but the paltry box-office take should surprise no one, no more so than when it makes similarly bad numbers in DVD sales next month.Still, I laughed. There are few stars who are fascinating enough to demand the screen just for being themselves... who else could have pulled this off? Christopher Walken? That's probably the entire list. What we've got here is lightning in a bottle.Now that the movie has left theaters, there's really only one place for it... next to every other awful movie in your collection that you watch with 10 friends, and mock the entire way through. Yes, that's right, it's awful. I admit it.But in a good way.",Snakes on a Plane

The verdict is somewhere in between. With as many jumps, deaths and one-liners as there are snakes, it is absolute stupid fun, and it does what it says on the tin. It has snakes on a plane and of course Samuel L Jackson doing his snizzle. One of my favourite bits, which is obviously due to our current climate of the threat of terror, is when they are looking for weapons on board to fight the snakes and find they only have plastic sporks, its comedy and cultural commentary. Personally I am not scared of snakes, flying or confined spaces so the horror factor for me was less than someone afflicted with these phobias, but I suppose spiders on a gas bill wouldn't cut it. This is not intelligent film-making it is no brained entertainment. Its good and you know exactly what you are getting so you can't possibly be disappointed.

(5.4 as of writing this review). It is now a love it of hate film, with very few people ignoring the history of the film and just taking it for how it is. While it is far from a 10-star thriller, ""Snakes on a Plane"" is just as far from mediocre. It is a solid and fun action flick, with some very over the top and memorable moments of mayhem. Samuel L. is superb in the lead and the film never takes itself seriously which allows it to get away with anything. The CGI snakes don't look the best, but the action is relentless as soon as the snakes are unleashed and it is great fun right up until the final scene. Guilty pleasure, for sure.",Snakes on a Plane
146,ExpendableMan,Awesome,9,29 August 2006,"Snakes On A Plane is a masterpiece. There, I said it, it's a masterpiece. A true epic of cinema. The kind of film that is so good, there should be a copy stored right in the very centre of the national archives with a beam of golden light directed down upon it so that all who gaze upon it's glorious visage will instantly be seized by the most violent desire to view the film, then immediately after gouge their own eyes out, knowing that they shall never again glance upon an art piece as worthy as this.Citizen Kane? The Third Man? Casablanca? The Godfather? The classics have had their turn and now is the time to bow down, for this is a masterpiece that is measured not in terms of ingenious cinematography, careful and considerate plotting or towering acting triumphs. No, Snakes On A Plane is a wholly different kind of classic simply for one thing; it has provided the world with a wholly new drinking game.The rules are so simple you don't even have to watch the film to compete. Best played in groups of four and above, the combatants are seated in a circle and the game commences when one person says: ""I declare to my right/left a game of Snakes On A Plane. Go."" From this point, each person must come up with a 'rejected pitch' that takes its name from an animal on a vehicle (for example 'Badgers On a Golf Cart') and drink as they think of it. Anyone who comes up with a title that repeats a vehicle or animal type that has already been said is penalised and must take a suitably vile drink to cover up for it. The game continues until everyone is either out of ideas or hopelessly bladdered.And for providing us with such merriment, Snakes On A Plane outdoes Armageddon as the previous movie drinking game champion because you don't even need to have seen the movie to compete. It takes a certain level of genius to accomplish that and if you find yourself in any doubt, just try playing the game. Soon you'll be knocking back tequila's with your mates and laughing like idiots to ideas like ""Moths in a Cable Car,"" ""Camels On The Eurostar"" or ""Gorillas In The Mist.""",Snakes on a Plane

1. The jump-scares are surprisingly well-timed and effective.
2. The gore is quite visceral and gritty.Cons:
1. There are too many cuts and edits, particularly as a lot of the shots cut to make no sense as to why they're there.
2. A few of the side performances are either incredibly wooden or over-acted.
3. Somehow in the beginning, Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) tracks down Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) before the gangsters even though there was no way Neville Flynn should have known where Sean Jones lived, or that the gangsters were even after him.
4. The dialogue is laughably clunky and virulently annoying: ""Well that's good news; snakes on crack.""
5. The film is tonally all over the place. It can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy or a serious action film, so much so that you never really know when to laugh or not.
6. The humour is woeful and immature, with one 'comedic' scene involving a snake biting a mans' penis. It elicits a roll of the eyes rather than a chuckle or a laugh.
7. The snake-eye cam looks awful and adds nothing to the tension, as well as being inserted randomly.
8. The special effect snakes haven't aged well thus diluting the horror as it's difficult to take the snakes seriously.
9. There are too many characters so none of them are even remotely fleshed out, therefore making the supposed emotional moments fall flat.
10. The generic action movie score provides nothing of any value to the movie.",Snakes on a Plane

The only problem there is that Snakes on a Plane isn't good.Boredom. The opening first hour is so insanely slow I honestly didn't even think I was watching an action movie. Even now that it's over, I'm not sure ""action"" is the right genre. Sure, the snake attacks were pretty intense when they started, but nothing special. I was bored through the majority of the runtime.Blandness. The majority of the plot, minus the snakes, is exactly what you've seen a thousand times. Mob boss, endangered suspect, people screaming and running around, ""we have to work together"" scene, ending, and countless scenes of pointless dialogue between. Even the snake attacks themselves were predictable. Really, who doesn't know where a snake is going to bite a naked passenger in a ""hardcore"" movie like this? It's nothing new. Nothing special. Even the ""weird"" characters were copy/pasted from every horror-comedy ever made.The only thing I can really complement on is Samuel L. Jackson's acting, which is flawless, as always. Still, it's just boring seeing him play the same tired FBI agent role.Seriously, after seeing so many movies like this I just ask: what's the point? It seems like every movie out there has an ""original"" catch (such as snakes on a plane) but do everything else exactly the same as every other movie. What's the point? People always try to argue that something can be unoriginal and still good, but I disagree wholesale. There is no suspense or mystery, because you've seen the same plot so many times you know exactly what is going to happen, even if it has something as blunt as snakes on a plane. It doesn't captivate you. And that's the same sad story with Snakes on a Plane.

Yeah, we've had the good films like Pirates of the Caribbean 2, United 93, Inside Man, MI3, and Running Scared, but it still hasn't been that great. Enter 'Snakes on a Plane', which blows every other film out of the water in terms of pure entertainment value. It's one of the most entertaining films of all time, because of the way that it blends almost every genre of film there is. In 'Snakes', there is horror, action, mystery, suspense, adventure, comedy, drama, and romance. Find me another film from the last 20 years that's done ALL of those well at once. It also helps that the film stars one of the bigggest badasses of all time in Samuel L. Jackson.The plot is actually intriguing and realistic...Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips of Wolf Creek) witnesses a murder of a District Attorney, committed by the man he is prosecuting: notorious gangster Eddie Kim. Kim manages to track Sean down, and plans to have him killed. Meanwhile, FBI Agent Neville Flynn (Jackson) is assigned to protect Sean as he flies from Honolulu to Los Angeles to testify against Eddie Kim. After Sean and Neville's flight takes off, one of the worst nightmares of any flier becomes reality: a timer hits zero, releasing hundreds of poisonous snakes throughout the plane.What you'll probably feel throughout the film is similar to the feeling you get when watching people fight: that feeling that makes you yell 'OH MY GOD' and start going crazy. The film is so awesome, words cannot even come close to describing it. The ways the director David R. Ellis makes the snakes attack the people is just so ingenious and original (I'm talking about how and why he has the snakes attack). The action is simply phenomenal. You'll love it, and won't be able to resist yelling out in amazement. I remember going 'OH!!!' at least ten to twelve times. The level of enjoyment and entertainment is at a yet to be reached point, because no film is even close to it. There is your fair share of scary moments, especially those 'jump out of your seat' moments (I hate and love those). The snakes are simply terrifyingly real and scary. The way they move is so...crazy. Sam Jackson's position of CEO of Bad Asses incorporated is further elevated, and yes, the famous line is uttered, and they build up to it so well. Also, one thing that makes this film work so much is the fact that there is so much humor. Classic one liners and hilarious characters make this movie almost as funny as it is scary. The adventure factor is awesome. Though it takes place on a commercial airliner, you'll feel as if the passengers are trying to escape a jungle. Now, if you like deep action films with underlying meaning, skip this film. It's one of those films where you just forget about reality, sit back, and watch this awesome film. This film is an instant cult classic for a generation. I'm so glad this is my generation's cult classic, much like Clerks is for the kids of the late 70's and early 80's. I love 'Snakes on a Plane'. It's the most entertaining film of its time. I highly recommend it to people ages 16 and up.10/10 --spy",Snakes on a Plane

FBI agent Neville Flynn (Jackson) is escorting Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) on a flight from Hawaii to Los Angeles to testify against a murder of a prosecutor by a crime leader Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson). But Kim has other plans. He organizes to get a time-release crate full of venomous snakes smuggled inside the plane, and spraying leis with pheromones that would make the snakes hostile. And 30,000 feet in the air, Flynn must work together with the other passengers of the plane to survive.Surprisingly, the result is a dandy campy film. ""Snakes on a Plane"" works mainly because the plot is ridiculous but not in a too idiotic way that gets in the way of campy enjoyment. Obviously we're not talking about profound experiences as far as this film is concerned but what it's set to do, it does well: a self-referential cheesy movie that knows what it is and has fun mocking itself.It combines two elements of a horror story - monsters and isolation - as the movie sets up the terror by having a group of people trapped in an airplane with aggressive snakes around them. It's partly homage, partly horror and mostly fun. And it happily takes the clichés and stereotypes while retaining the offbeat styles and bizarre humor of movies of its kind.The cast plays over-the-top and rightly so. Jackson is the lone big name in this film and he's obviously enjoying hamming it up with the m****f****** snakes. The special effects are on the cheesy B-movie territory but not going into overkill.Overall, ""Snakes on a Plane"" is basically a fancy B-movie, the kind you aren't supposed to take seriously. It will work for some, it won't for others. But for those who appreciate dumb popcorn entertainment, here's one good flick.",Snakes on a Plane
155,illbebackreviews,One of the better thriller films I've seen in a while,7,20 October 2012,"I was quite surprised when I watched this film. There were a bunch of good actors, most notably Samuel Jackson who really does save the film. The plot was okay, but there could've been more explanation. One thing I would've liked was if they showed Eddie at the end, but its not that much.The biggest problem about this film is despite Eddie being the ""villain"" sort person, they barely showed him. Apart from that, this movie sure was a thrilling action ride. I personally went in watching this film without much hope, but I was proved quite wrong. This film is actually very funny, with one of Sam Jackson's most famous lines delivered at the end of this film. The visual effects were great, the acting was good and overall a great film",Snakes on a Plane
156,mirosuionitsaki2,"What's the Big Hype, Dude?",7,1 August 2007,"Snakes on a Plane was an full of action and excitement. Well, not much excitement. It seemed sort of predictable. But I did love one thing, Kenan Thompson was in this movie. The ending was probably the only time he actually got to be a big part of the movie and also the only time Samuel L. Jackson did something amusing in the movie or said. ""Praise the Playstation!"" Haha.I also liked how this movie differs from the regular plane crash movies, island movies, ship movies, whatever movies that people are in a life threatening situation and some guy with power starts telling everyone what to do. This movie didn't have the common pregnant woman you see in those movies where the situation gets worse because she goes into labor on the ship/plane/train. I also like how this didn't have the common ""whisper"" when someone is hurt or something, they talk so low that it shouldn't be part of the script. ""You're going to be alright."" Oh, I have forgotten. The man who was in behind this didn't really play a big role. It was just the snakes and one scene when the guy who caused it all gets shot.Might I add one more thing? I don't really understand what's the big hype about this movie. People are telling me that it's some culture or fad thing and I don't understand. I just watched it cause I like these types of movies. So, I recommend this movie to not everyone but maybe 18 and older?",Snakes on a Plane
157,tnrcooper,Thoroughly satisfying popcorn-movie entertainment,9,13 June 2010,"Really loved this film. I'm gonna keep it short because this isn't the most important movie and it's 2010 so it's even less important now. It had some hype and a lot of buzz about how its cheesiness was its primary virtue. It was self-consciously entertaining (there are snakes on the plane! I think there could be danger!) but that is not necessarily bad. Obviously not much plot here. A kid named Sean (Nathan Phillips) witnesses a mob hit and in order to prevent him from testifying against the mob boss, the mob try to bring down the plane he is on. Federal agent Neville Flynn (Sam Jackson) tries to prevent this from occurring. That's the plot. The characters are serviceable although almost unanimously stock. This is good popcorn entertainment. Neville does his job, snakes kill people in graphic, cheesy ways, stock characters behave by and large honorably. It's just good, popcorn-eating entertainment. That said, if one buys the premise that lots of snakes could be smuggled onto a plane, one will enjoy this film. It has its own internal logic.",Snakes on a Plane

159,general-melchett,Doesn't quite kick asp...,7,6 February 2007,"Snakes on a Plane isn't meant to be a masterpiece - if anything, it's meant to be the opposite. The special effects are all right but slightly cheesy, the script, plot and storyline wafer-thin and left unresolved, and the characters hard to give a damn about. But, let's be honest, the film's premise is in the title. And if you only came to the cinema to see some passengers go crazy up in the sky with some snakes, this is more than likely to please you. The action may not be Oscar-material, but it sure is fast-paced - for about half an hour, it never lets up. And let's be fair - none of the special effects were glaringly bad. Though the ending just feels like one huge gag - and none of it really makes sense, it was satisfactory. But what happened to the snakes? At nighttime, they were everywhere. Come morning, they were all gone. And this just left it too easy for the film to be resolved. The gags weren't hilarious - personally, I wasn't roaring at the much-hyped ""motherf***ing snakes"" line. It would have worked better had it been roared the previous night if Sam Jackson had been bitten. I would also like to know what happened to Eddie Kim (was that his name?) and the actual murder itself. But Snakes on a Plane doesn't care about that, and throws them straight out the window after they are mentioned. It provides us with some fun action and some classic quotes, and that is why it is worth a watch. The cover of the tape is so B-movie-like that I laughed when I first saw it (Region 2, that is). But this is what Snakes on a Plane is meant to be - cheesy B-movie fun. And on that scale, it delivers. 7/10",Snakes on a Plane
160,TheMovieMark,Not as cheesy as I was hoping for,5,1 September 2006,"The beautiful thing about Snakes on a Plane is that its title automatically and immediately removes all pretense. It intentionally screams, ""I'm a bad movie, so criticizing plot and acting is a waste of your time!"" Hey, I love the philosophy. If your movie is ridiculous then swing for the fences and embrace the cheesiness that your title will not allow you to avoid.But here's my problem. For the average movie the following statement would be at least somewhat of a compliment (or less of an insult), but in regard to Snakes on a Plane, it's a disappointment - the movie isn't as bad as I was hoping it would be.Oh, there's plenty of fun to be had. The movie starts a little slow, but once the snakes get loose on the plane, effectively turning the movie into ""snakes on a (choose a body part),"" moments of out-loud laughter abound. If you're the type of person who can laugh at snakes attacking people in ridiculous ways, that is. You have to be willing to tap into your juvenile sense of humor, and I was along for the ride.But once the third act arrived, everybody focused way too much on figuring out how to land the plane, and the snakes took a back seat. Or would that be a window seat? Bwahahahaha! *ahem* My apologies. I wanted more deaths by snakes! I wanted things to get even more and more outlandish! You see, as the movie rolled along I kept thinking of crazy scenes or actions that would be perfect, but I couldn't help but be disappointed when my ideas were never explored. For example, why have a kickboxer on the plane but not have him deliver at least a single roundhouse kick to a snake? Now THAT is the kind of silliness I wanted more of. Can you imagine how good this could have been if Chuck Norris had co-starred? Man, a snake attacking Chuck's beard only to be repelled by its beard-like powers would have been pure gold.And where are all the bad, cheesy, pun-laced one-liners? Sure, we got ""Make it fast. Time is tissue,"" but overall this isn't nearly as quotable as I had hoped. Come on, couldn't Samuel L. throw us a little, ""It's time to kick some asp,"" to savor or something? I want cringe-inducing dialogue! Here, let me treat y'all to another example that would have been perfect. Picture the scene...Everybody is running around the plane, freaking out. Somebody off screen yells, ""Snakes! On the plane!"" Then the camera focuses on an old man with a cane, wobbling down the plane aisle, doing his best to flee the snakes. Samuel L. Jackson's partner would then turn to Jackson and say, ""Looks like he has even bigger problems - he's got shakes on a cane!"" Then Jackson would give his partner a turned-up-nose glare the likes of which is usually reserved for horrific smells. The line would rock, but Jackson's silent response would totally sell it. Everybody goes home happy. But alas, the film didn't dare get that campy.Another problem with Snakes is that ""bad cinema"" is usually at its best when it isn't intentionally trying to be bad. Take A Sound of Thunder, for example. That movie is one of the biggest $80 million disasters to ever hit the screen. But it's also one of the funniest bad movies I've ever seen at the theater. There's just something magical about people putting a lot of effort and money into trying to make something good only to have it turn out painfully bad. When Hollywood jobs are lost because of how big a failure has been delivered then that's when the real fun begins.When you're delivering cheesiness with a wink and a nod to the audience then you've gotta go all-out over-the-top. Just inserting a few ""f"" bombs and some nudity merely to get an R rating isn't gonna do it.I still don't know if the movie's original intent was to be bad, or if that was just a byproduct of the Internet hype. Did the filmmakers realize that no one was going to take the film seriously so they decided to do a little re-shooting and THEN play it as an intentionally cheesy movie? After all, Snakes on a Plane was only a working title and at one time it was going to be changed to Pacific Air Flight 121.Movie executives and Jackson's agent were in favor of the title change, and that's what leads me to believe that everybody initially wanted to play this straight until they realized they couldn't turn back.I have to give Samuel L. Jackson credit though - he refused to let them make the title change. ""That's the only reason I took the job: I read the title,"" he told Collider.com. ""You either want to see that, or you don't."" That pretty much sums it up.",Snakes on a Plane

Its basically about a man who witnesses a brutal killing and the bad guys try to kill the witness. The witness is protected by an FBI man played by Samuel L. Jackson. Flying by plane to escape and escort the witness, the bad guys put a load of venomous snakes on board.Apart from the daft title, the film lives up to my expectation's and maby even surpassed them.

163,freaky_dave,A Pleasant Surprise,7,18 August 2006,"I was surprised that Snakes On A Plane was as entertaining as it was. When I went into the movie I wasn't expecting too much, but this movie delivered much more then I suspected.Samuel Jackson is Nelville Flynn, and FBI agent who has to protect Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) from being killed. You see Sean is their only witness to a brutal murder. The murderer has lots of influence though, and is able to put a variety of poisonous snakes on the plane that both Nelville and Sean are taking from Hawaii to LA where Sean must testify. Using some sort of pheromone that makes the snakes attack everyone, they are let loose on the plane and do some rather nasty things to many people on the flight. I really don't have to say much more about the plot.David Ellis directs a fine movie and Samuel Jackson seems to be having a grand old time in the role. The other major characters were interesting as well, and both Jackson and Jones have a pretty good chemistry together.The visuals of the snakes were pretty good, but you could tell that they were CGI. I did enjoy the various ways that the snakes attacked, but what surprised me the most was that all of the major actors involved also seemed to have a fun time making this movie. Yes this movie has humor and likable characters.I don't know what genre I would put it under though. It could be action or horror. It could also be a comedy as well. There were so many scenarios, but since it does involve some rather nasty killings, I would have to put it under horror.Snakes On A Plane is not a great movie, but it is a good one which should entertain anybody who sees it.

Their has already been a lot of films with snakes like Anaconda, King Cobra and Python but they are all rubbish and with no story. This movie is nothing like them it has an amazing story and it's very relentless. Samuel L. Jackson's acting as usual was terrific and his line ""Enough is enough! I have had it with these mother f**king snakes on this mother f**king plane!"" is a trademark of the film just like ""I'll be back"" in The Terminator. The rest of the actors are all new and not very well known but the boy who is the witness he was in Wolf Creek, the young blonde air hostess in first class was the alien Sarah in Species 3 and the girl in the bathroom with another boy was in Final Destination 3 one of the girls in the sun bed. It was about 1 hour 40 minutes and I enjoyed every second of it.

167,RhapsodyReviews,Not Purposely Funny.,5,19 November 2019,"Review:
'Snakes on a Plane' is a action-thriller film directed by David R. Ellis.
Some movies are so bad they're funny, but this one is in on the joke. It never misses an opportunity to play off of a colorful character or set up an obvious jump scare, but it is careful not to overstay its welcome.
America is on the search for the murderer Eddie Kim. Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) must fly to L.A. to testify in a hearing against Kim. Accompanied by FBI agent Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson), the flight receives some unexpected visitors.
You will constantly laugh at Samuel L. Jackson showing off how cool he is. There are plenty of moments where he kicks ass and gives some great one-liners and does amusing things, but he is offscreen just as often as he is on it. Long story short, everybody else in the movie is god awful.
It has bad CGI but generally covers it up with the use of light and shadow. The snakebites are surprisingly brutal for how minor they could have been, and the plot is a by-the-numbers witness protection airplane disaster movie, acting only as a backdrop for the fun of the movie to play out against. It's a crazy and ridiculous concept that doesn't make any sense. Also, they don't use venomous snakes even though most of the time it's bad CGI.

168,Spaceygirl,Great fun!,10,7 January 2007,"""Snakes on a Plane"" is just the most fun you can have with your clothes on! It's by far the most entertaining film of 2006. The best thing about ""Snakes"" is that it doesn't take itself seriously. It knows its a fun movie and the cast just enjoy their roles. Samuel L Jackson has a ball as an FBI Agent and Julianna Margulies (where are your curls, girl?) excels as the female lead and possible love interest. The script is great, filled with wit and humour. ""Snakes"" probably has some of the funniest one-liners I've ever heard. The snakes themselves have a great time too, the cobra moving in a way I've never seen cobras move before. CG'd perhaps?

Firstly I thought the film had way to much comedy elements for it to be an edge of seat movie.
Secondly the cgi didn't work, yes there were times it did work but others it didn't.
When are the Hollywood big wigs going to realize that cgi isn't advanced enough for it to work, maybe in a few years time, yes but not now.
They should go back to the old days and remember sometimes less is more and make it more edgy.

171,vailsy,the snakes look CRAP,1,22 August 2006,"when discussing a movie titled 'snakes on a plane', we should point out early that the snakes are pretty darn important to the plot.what we have here are very bad cgi snakes that neither look nor move like real snakes. snakes are scary because they appear to be slimy, they crawl they slither. these snakes do nothing of the sort. they glide along like they would in a video game. they are cartoon snakes. i would go as far to say that even someone that had a major phobia against real snakes would not find these ones scarywhy on earth then would you want to include extreme close ups of these cgi failures? why not rely on suspense.. the whole 'less is more' ethic. or better still, why not just make them look good in the first place? and then maybe still use them sparinglytake one look at john carpenters 'the thing'. here we have real slime, and gore of eerie proportions. 20 years go by and we get this pile of stinking sfx crap 'snakes on a plane'. when are these people going to wake up and smell the coffee? special effects are going backwards!sure you could say.. but the movie is a joke, get it? sure i'm with that idea, but do it well! in addition to the above, this movie has crap dialogue. and the music and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any way.i could handle every other actor being part of this movie, except for jackson. what was he doing there? the man who starred in pulp fiction 10 years ago. is this career progression? are you offering people value for money? no. i'd like to know what Tarantino thought when he was half way through this stinker of a moviethe current generation seem to have very low expectations. and Hollywood seems to be offering them just what they want. on leaving the cinema i saw a number of advertisements for some truly horrendous looking future releases including... DOA: dead or alive, (another) cgi animal film called 'flushed away', and another crap looking comedy named 'click'. in addition to that i saw some awful trailers, including one for (another) crap British horror/comedy. i've truly not seen the movie industry in a mess like this for a long timeexpect to see this movie for sale in the DVD bargain section for £1 in 6 months time. and if you're expecting to see a black comedy with tonnes of great looking snakes, and some bad ass cool dialogue coming from samuel l jacksons lips. forget it.",Snakes on a Plane

Jackson as a FBI agent who's escorting a key witness to a trial in LA. He happens to be flying on Pacific flight 121. Although an assassin has left some slithery surprises in the cargo hold in an attempt to kill the witness.I seriously can't believe that i enjoyed this film as much as I did. The hype for this movie is notorious. In the future, people will say ""man, the new film (insert future film) is getting a lot of good reviews... although it's no where nearly as hyped as that movie 'Snakes on a Plane' "".It could be said that the incredible support for this film is in fact a joke, because one would expect the obvious just from hearing the plot: the film will be an extremely cheesy B film that will forever be remembered for it's corniness.Cheesy? sure. Corny? maybe once or twice. But you try naming a film that's more original or more fun and I'll SHOW YOU BABY Jesus.The film was a mixture of interesting action / horror and comedy. the viewer will be expecting all of the one-liners... the stereotypical characters with stereotypical motives... and all the slithery insanity. Somehow it all works. this is a film that takes itself seriously. and it's the fact that this movie has such a heart of gold for its characters and its mission to have fun that the viewer can't help but admire ""snakes on a Plane"".Sam Jackson must have had a lot of fun making this film. he's very supportive of the project and totally understands the concept of the premise. He's super cool in this movie as always, and when you hear him scream the infamously notoriously obviously cool line of dialog that everyone has been hearing about, you just want to stand up and cheer. I myself was clapping with a large number of people near the end of the film when he bellows ""I'VE HAD IT WITH THESE MOTHERF***ING SNAKES... ON THIS MOTHERF***ING PLANE!!!!!!!!"" Another reason why i think this film is so good is because it hides nothing. the makers of the film knew that the material was pure B-movie quality, and that there was no way anyone would accept it as just another hard-boiled action thriller, or deeply-moving piece of cinematic mastery. instead, the film tells it like it is and asks you that you just sit back and enjoy the ride. This is a movie that is not trying to be a Hollywood product, it is simply a movie.it is really rare that you find a movie that has such honestly... and even more so rare to find an honest movie that is as much fun as this one.8 motherf***ing stars out of 10.",Snakes on a Plane
173,lagriff05,So ridiculous that it's absolutely great,9,17 June 2007,"Snakes on a plane. Sit back in your chair for a second and think about that. It's ludicrous. It's hilarious. It's stupid. Whether you like the movie or not, a title like that demands attention, forcibly drawing you in. Some people will scoff and wonder how something so trite and nonsensical could ever be entertaining, and some, like myself, will laugh and immediately want to go see it. A title like that doesn't show a lack of preparation; oh no. The directors of this one wanted to get people's attention and knew how to do it. I saw some of the other 'pending' titles for the film: ""Venom"", ""Flight 121."" Now, if the movie was titled either of those, then would it have been as popular? Would it have gained such an ""lol ironic"" cult status before the movie even came out? No, I doubt it. Snakes on a Plane is the best possible title the movie could've gotten, because the directors were smart, and they wanted to make people KNOW about this one.Now, is it as good as the hype from Samuel L. Jackson and the crew might suggest?Yes, I'd say so.Snakes on a Plane isn't trying to re-invent anything, and it's not claiming to be the new Messiah of action/horror/comedy movies. It's just a lot of fun. It's a B flick, the same way Friday the 13th was in the 80s. It's got blood and gore and tits and the whole package, but it's modernized to a tee, polished to a clean, silver sheen that really takes the whole package to another level. The acting and directing is all fine, no complaints at all, and some of the camera angles are quite entertaining. Who ever suspected there were so many creative ways for a snake to bite people? This doesn't take itself seriously, it knows what it wants to do. And what it wants to do is really kick ass while making you laugh, and sometimes squirm in your chair at the more disgusting parts.The plot is extremely ridiculous, but the movie knows that already anyway. A bunch of snakes let loose on a plane. If you take this kind of thing seriously for even a second, then you're obviously not the target audience it was trying to reach, and thus your opinion is invalid. I quite enjoyed this overall, for it was about the most fun I've ever had watching a cheesy film about a large black man killing snakes on crack atop a plane that could fall out of the sky any moment....yeah.On a purely objective level, this film is quite colorful in it's repertoire of comedy and light, harmless scares. The plot is fast paced and very easy to follow, and everything seems to fit right where it belongs. The directors wouldn'tve let it out of the gate otherwise, for there's not much room for mistakes in these huge, big-name blockbuster films. It all follows a very simplistic structure, and I couldn't ask for anything else.Samuel L. Jackson gives a very convincing performance here as a veteran secret agent, and I doubt anyone else would've been up for the role. Juliana Marguiles and Nathan Philips are also great actors, and something about their serious, timid, run-of-the-mill performances seems ironic in contrast with how crazy the film really is. And the icing on the cake for me was a performance by Kenan Thompson, whose exploits I had always enjoyed as a child. There are no duds here, nobody that brings down the quality of the movie.Snakes on a Plane isn't going to break new ground (or maybe it will---who ever heard of a cheeseball plot like this?), but it's one of the most entertaining films I've seen in a long, long time. It's quite the interesting blend of 80s B-horror, Die Hard-esquire action fun, and slapstick comedy, along with some secret agent type stuff thrown in for good measure. There's something here for everyone! The more lighthearted movie fans won't be disappointed, and with that I will highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a good time.",Snakes on a Plane

Anyway, this movie is about a bad-ass hit-man/kung fu master who sets loose a whole paella of venomous snakes on a flight to L.A. The only man who can stop this slithering army of creepy crawlies is hard-ass cop Samuel L. Jackson (who for some reason is called ""Neville Flynn"" by the characters in this movie). Sam Jackson kicks major snake ass for the majority of this movie. There's also boobs, chicks, gore, you name it. It makes for THE cult classic of 2006. Only a soulless person could possibly be disappointed by this. If you love your country, see Snakes. If you hate your country, see it anyway. Snakes on a Plane is an honest movie that stays true to its title throughout. If you went in expecting to see a movie about snakes on a plane, you got what you wanted. If you expected a sensitive drama starring Anthony Hopkins, you were bound to be disappointed. This is ass-kickery at its finest. Unbelievably awesome dialogue is fried gold icing on a cake from heaven. Snakes on a Plane rules. I see no reason to watch any other movie ever again after seeing this. Does United 93 feature snakes posing as terrorists? Does Anaconda feature Sam Jackson in a leather jacket? Didn't think so.The scene in which the gay flight attendant puts a snake in a microwave is the very height of cinematic excellence. You do not want to miss this movie. It's worth dying for. Worth killing for. Worth going to Florida for.Amen.",Snakes on a Plane
176,joestank15,"I keep looking for reasons to hate it, but This was a lot of fun!",8,26 August 2006,"Snakes on a Plane bitch! YES! I love this movie! As much as one CAN love a B horror movie! This movie takes the most improbably stupid ideas and runs with it. Never mind the fact that snakes, pheromones or not, when put in the storage compartment (the coldest part of a plane) would instantly hibernate. Nevermind the countless plot-gaps in an already thin plot. This is about snakes killing people in numerous ways. It's the film's only card, but it has as much fun with it as it can. it's F*cking SNAKES, all kinds and sizes, killing people in various creepy, shocking, and disgusting ways. I won't say much more for not knowing is half the fun of these movies, but it will take some doing to get me to use an airplane bathroom again. Though they're a fun trick, Snakes are not the film's ONLY card. It also has Samuel L. Jackson who plays the bad-@ss SO well. If I were in danger, Mr. Jackson is the one person I'd want to have with me to see it through. The man just has charisma galore. The film also has a decent supporting cast I felt something like affection for. They fill in the usual 2 dimensional characters, do it nicely, and I grew to like a few of them. By way of horror movie character development the movie's got nothing on Jaws or Dawn of the Dead, but they did a decent job.The film has all the usual logistics flaws of a terrible movie, but is so fun and manages to avoid any of the other problems that terrible movies have. It does not bog itself down with annoying characters or boring exposition. It also has a good script, good one lines, and seems to genuinely have fun with itself by way of killing people off. This movie is some of the most fun I've had this year in the cinema. I give it a B+",Snakes on a Plane
177,saarvardi,Exactly what the doctor ordered for late-summer film season,10,18 August 2006,"Let's sum it up from the very beginning: in my book, Snakes on a Plane lived up to its hype. The special f/x were top notch, the atmosphere and settings were raunchy and crude yet gripping and exciting, and some of the actors actually did a pretty good job with that ludicrous script they received. After directing thrillers like Final Destination 2 and Cellular, the film's director David R. Ellis has proved the world he knows how to do his job. His direction is fast paced, swift, very accurate and engaging. In S.O.A.P you get all this, plus awesome and authentic snake effects wrapped up with some very twisted dark humor.The thing is that you have to suspend your disbelief walking into the theater. The plot is dumb (an angry mobster tries to eliminate a key witness against him by unleashing hundreds of deadly snakes inside an airplane he's in), and the supposed explanations to how this is done are unbelievable at best. However, the premise in only the means to deliver the audience what it's been looking for all summer: brainless action, thrilling sequences, gruesome deaths by snakes with an insane death toll, and Samuel L. Jackson doing his thing, while being all cool and groovy about it. This is the ultimate guy flick, and an anti-thesis to numerous chick-flicks that attacked us throughout the summer (which was OK by me, and by all the other males that sat with me in the audience). The Devil Wears Prada became a 2006 hit with the ladies? S.O.A.P. is just what the doctor ordered for the guys - endless violence, a spark of sex, CG snakes and one extremely angry African American cop that was supposed to escort the witness safely to court and eventually goes berserk when all hell breaks lose in front of him.Take my word - Snakes on a Plane is pure late summer fun. It's everything Ancaonda and it's poor sequel wnated to be but didn't have the courage to do. Bring your friends, buy a bucket of popcorn and soda, switch your brain to auto-pilot and enjoy the ride. In the end, I bet you'll even be pleasantly surprised by how good some of the plot elements actually turned out to be.P.S. - Keep an eye out for above-average performances by newcomer Bruce James as the hilarious stereotypic male flight attendant, Wolf Creek's Nathan Phillips as the clueless witness and former E.R.'s Julianna Margulies as the female lead besides Jackson (she really needs to get some more roles, IMO).",Snakes on a Plane
178,Pavel-8,Snakes on a Plane!,7,9 December 2006,"""Snakes on a Plane"" revives a lost art in Hollywood, the B-movie, a movie that realizes its own shortcomings and cheesiness, and relishes such things, following in the recent tradition of ""Eight-Legged Freaks"" and ""Starship Troopers"". Therefore you must have the proper mindset going in. If you expect an action movie like ""Mission: Impossible III"", you will be disappointed. If expect a tense thriller similar to ""Die Hard 2"", you will be disappointed. If you expect an Oscar contender, you're just plain stupid.The storyline is largely irrelevant. Strike that. It's entirely irrelevant. The bottom line is that hundreds of poisonous serpents end up on an trans-Pacific flight. The build-up to the anticipated action isn't that bad; but at half an hour, it still takes too long before the snakes appear.Fortunately for all involved, Samuel L. Jackson is an FBI agent on the flight. Not only is he there to save the flight, he's there to endow the movie with a little respect. As one of the few familiar faces, Jackson is perfect for his role, in which he more or less plays himself, or at least his screen persona. But he is perhaps the only actor who could fill such a part, one that requires a sense of seriousness among laughably wacky situations. He brings with him a gravitas that lends credibility to the movie. His mere presence as an actor elevates the flick beyond its late-night cable pedigree to something worthy of being on a big screen.Part of the reason ""Snakes"" fits that pedigree is its lack of subtlety. Like its title, the movie paints in broad strokes, both in plot and character. The people on the flight are little more than caricatures, ranging from a effeminate male flight attendant to a rich chihuahua-toting heiress. That's fine, if not preferred. In a movie where many of the characters are going to soon meet their doom, who cares about any intricacies of spirit? The movie just draws a few necessary outlines before splattering them with blood and snakes.Much like the avalanche of recent horror movies, the blood and the accompanying screams are the point of the whole shebang. You go to this movie to gleefully cringe at the awful fates and almost equally awful dialogue. You go to scream at the jump scenes, to cheer at motivational speeches, and to recoil in mock shock at just about everything. The difference between ""Snakes"" and its horror counterparts is that this movie possesses a sense of humor. The movie is so ludicrously over-the-top that you can almost see and hear the makers winking and chuckling behind the camera. So if you see it, do so with a group of friends and overreact to everything; ""Snakes on a Plane"" is a movie best experienced corporately, although it's definitely not for children or anyone who fears slithering reptiles.Bottom Line: Good times. 7 of 10 for a wildly entertaining experience that meets expectations wonderfully.",Snakes on a Plane

180,teh_mode,Does exactly what it says on the tin,6,7 September 2006,"It arrived in a trail-blaze of over-hyped glory. Yet despite the efforts of what seemed like every spotty internet nerd in history, Snake On Plane actually isn't the greatest film ever made. With that said it's not bad, when it actually gets going, despite the most ridiculous opening 20 minutes of movie reel footage I've seen this year. Sam Jackson cashes in on a career that once upon a time was lavished with screen credits for Spike Lee, Quentin Tarantino and Steven Spielberg.Why bother explaining the plot of this one? Who cares about some surfer dude witnessing a murder, on the run from Asian gangsters, blah blah blah. Basically, right: There are these snakes? And they're on a plane. End of story. Oh, and they're mightily hacked off at something. Cue Roger Corman style madness involving bitten breasts and fat ladies getting a kick out of nosey slippery critters crawling up your pantyhose. Yum.Some of S.O.A.P. is actually quite nasty. They have found an incredibly unbalanced mixture of grotesque and ridiculous - the type of ridiculous where you aren't quite sure whether it is meant to be or not, so you just go along with it - that will have you giggling whilst squirming in horror. Snakes On A Plane is every bit as flimsy as it's title, but possesses enough action to make it worth the trip. There is no way it could have lived up to the hype - it is clear in some scenes that this obviously became something else once word got out about it's notorious title. Don't expect anything more than a brainless ride of scaly fun and you shouldn't be disappointed.",Snakes on a Plane
181,reeves2002,A cheesy & ridiculous film but it was free.,1,19 August 2006,"I am glad that it was a free screening of this movie by the time I left the theater and thank Christ I didn't pay a dime. I remember seeing all the previews for this movie prior to seeing it and it looked like a good action/suspenseful disaster movie. Wow was I wrong!I had no idea it was a brainless B movie that seemed to kill off white's only and make them look stupid.It also stereo-typed nearly everyone else as well.Of course if a few more of the obnoxious characters(members of the rap group) were bitten and killed in over the top ways then I may have enjoyed it more.That said,I did find parts of the movie funny and the effects weren't bad. I am more a fan of thriller and suspense and thought the movie flight plan was better.If Snakes on a plane was written more intelligently,and portrayed more scary instead of B rated I think it would have been equally as good because the storyline was simple,transporting a passenger to L.A. by the F.B.I. to testify against the animal(Asian mob or gang leader)at the beginning.The special effects aboard the plane were great, but they could have left the camp and stupidity out.I know if it were done this way it would be a whole different movie but an equally as good one. For anyone expecting this movie to be a thriller like I thought,it is far from this.As for it being disappointing,that is up to the individual.It seems the comments on here are from people who loved this film and obviously knew what to expect or what kind of a ridiculous movie it was gonna be. Again I'm glad that I didn't have to pay to see it and don't expect others to agree with me,but is there anyone who didn't like this film? If so i'd like to read some of their comments as i'm sick of hearing nothing but praise for this cheesy flick and reading the same boring sentences over and over again",Snakes on a Plane

It's ok, but can't seem to decide if it is a horror or comedy film. It filled in some time and there were occasions where it was suspenseful, but I wouldn't watch it again. But then, I don't like SLJ very much, so that's an added disincentive to watch it a second time.",Snakes on a Plane
183,MetalGeek,Pure B-Movie Goodness...,8,27 June 2010,"Remember 2006? A bunch of dorks with blogs decided that this upcoming film was going to be the greatest thing since canned beer, and started an Internet hype phenomenon that the film had no chance of actually living up to. The film opened to disappointing box office (I assume that meant all the bloggers who had been championing the movie must've downloaded it off the Internet rather than buying a ticket to see it), and by the end of the year everyone looked back on the whole experience like, ""Wow. That was really stupid."" While the Internet fueled ""Snake Mania"" was going on I'll admit it made me curious to check out the film, but for whatever reason (mainly due to a snake-o-phobic spouse who absolutely refused to watch it), I never got a chance to see ""S.o.a.P."" till this past week. So how's the movie hold up nearly four years later? I'd say pretty damn good!! Most of us are afraid of snakes, and a lot of us are afraid to fly, so you actually have to wonder how it took Hollywood this long to come up with the idea of combining two of man's biggest fears.Before you get started on this movie, be aware that it's nothing' but formulaic B-grade action junk (with an added slice of horror due to gory snake attacks); in other words, as long as you're not expecting Shakespeare this ride should serve you just fine. Samuel L. Jackson is both hilarious and bad-ass in his role as an FBI agent transporting a murder witness from Honolulu to L.A. to testify in a murder trial. Unfortunately, the associates of the defendant in said trial, a murderous Asian drug lord, have booby trapped the plane with a horde of angry, poisonous serpents in hopes of bringing the plane down while it's over the ocean. When those bad boys start popping out of overhead compartments and crawling up passenger's legs, mayhem, as you might imagine, ensues.Once the initial, gory attack scenes and predictable ""OH MY GOD, THERE ARE SNAKES ON THE PLANE!"" hysteria subsides, the movie settles into predictable air-disaster cliché; stewardess Julianna Margulies seriously does ask the passengers if anyone knows how to fly a plane, ala ""Airplane!"", while Jackson descends into the bowels of the crippled airplane to get it back on course, among other ""air disaster movie"" scenes we've seen a dozen or more times before. I won't violate the Spoiler Warning rules by telling you how it all turns out, but if you've seen enough of these types of movies you can probably figure it out by yourself.When the Internet hype is taken out of the ""S.o.a.P"" equation (seriously, what were those people thinking?), ""Snakes on a Plane"" is just a good old fashioned ""B"" movie. I laughed, I cringed, I enjoyed it, and sometime down the road I'd gladly watch it again.",Snakes on a Plane

I thought it was cool when the snakes started killing people and Sam Jackson took a taser to them. A priceless gem in cinema. I can't believe it's not doing better than it is right now at the box office. you would think that with all the generated buzz The Blair Witch received pre release that this film could reach that highs of money making.

But you don't become a cult classic before you are released okay, they build all this hype but look at ""Night of the Living Dead"" that's a cult classic because it was original in the 60's. ""Snakes"" is an idiotic, campy play about an assassin bent on killing a witness with a large array of venomous snakes. The only thing between the snakes and the witness is an angry cop who apparently hates snakes (Jackson, laughing it up). ""Snakes"" will be a big success, I did not find it funny or campy but just down right stupid. The concept is good but some things are better left untouched. (Dir. David R Ellis)",Snakes on a Plane
186,samseescinema,a bizarre and unique movie-going experience,6,19 August 2006,"Snakes on a Plane reviewed by Sam Osbornrating: 2.5 out of 4The strange little phenomenon of 2006 is finally here. Never has it mattered less whether or not critics approve of a movie. Despite early reports that the film was actually liked by test audiences, New Line Studios still made the decision not to allow pre-screenings for critics. Well, I for one was not to be deterred and lined up along with the group of fifteen-year old boys chanting ""Snakes, Snakes, Snakes"" for the midnight screening. Is it as good as we all hoped, or as terrible as we all hoped? For me there's only fun or not fun, and Snakes on a Plane unexpectedly falls somewhere in between.It's a tough film to pull off. A certain tone must be struck, where silly, farcical camp must meet slithery fear and story. The film can't degenerate into pure parody since the snake and plane gimmick would grow old long before credits rolled. Snakes on a Plane has to scare us and at least draw us some of the way into its outrageous tale if it wants to satisfy its rabid audiences. There is, on the other hand, the element of Snakes on a Plane's default cult status. People are buying tickets to see what they believe to be a terrible flick. And there's an awkward moment as the film begins when the audience realizes that, to an extent, Snakes on a Plane wants to be taken seriously. But it's a situation where no matter how good the film actually is in a serious sense, audiences will still adore the hype and experience, and come back for second helpings. This doesn't actually answer whether or not Snakes on a Plane is any fun, though. Well to answer the question, it is, but only kind of. Before it lifts off to cruising altitude, the film spins a yarn surrounding a notorious Los Angeles mobster tracking down a witness for the prosecution. Agent Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) is charged with the witness' protection and is trying to transfer him from Honolulu to L.A. without incident. We also get several well-spun sub-plots surrounding the other passengers aboard the infested flight. They play off the usual stereotypes, but do so with a fresh and easy humor that skims over the clichés like they're only the obligatory ingredients to a wonderful recipe. From there it's all hissing and snake-bites and the title kicks in as self-explanatory.The comedy works fine, with Sam Jackson doing his badass thing and snakes lunging for genitalia, but it's the excitement that wanes with the running length. After you've seen one snake attack, you've pretty much seen them all. There are exceptions, like with the massive anaconda who devours a person whole, but otherwise the snake attacks quickly become nondescript. Director David R. Ellis keeps things varied, however, launching a sub-plot with the FBI rescue effort on land, following Special Agent Harris (Bobby Cannavale) as he tracks down the required anti-venoms, and little set-pieces like when Agent Flynn must find and flip the inevitable switch at the snakes' source.And then there's the line. You know the line, we all do. The one about the mothereffing snakes on this mothereffing plane. That one. Well, it's there and as fine and dandy as we all expected it to be. There was a great whooping cheer as Jackson said it, loud enough to drown out his succeeding two lines. It's really a moment worth seeing the film for. But, on the whole, Jackson still doesn't exude badass to his greatest potential. In my humble but hugely partial opinion, Jackson is only a true badass under the tutelage of one Mr. Quentin Tarantino. Without him behind Jackson, there's a key element missing. That's not to say Jackson doesn't get his fair share of badass moments. My favorite is after the snake expert describes how pheromones act like a drug for the serpents. In response Jackson snorts in mock humor, ""Great. Snakes on crack,"" and slams down the phone. Despite my occasional foray with arrogant pomposity, in general I don't consider myself to be pretentious film writer. I recommended Final Destination 3, for goodness sake. So my negativity isn't borne out of film elitism or any such nonsense. Snakes on a Plane is a mildly exciting experience, one that is hugely affected by those around you. I wouldn't recommend seeing it alone on a lazy Tuesday morning when the theatre will be empty. Go see it opening weekend, with a sold-out theatre and a group of rowdy friends. It's a bizarre and unique movie-going experience, no matter how good Snakes on a Plane actually is.",Snakes on a Plane

In the decision making process, I had to ask myself the basic questions like, ""Why?"", ""Should I?"", and ""Oh hell, why not?"". So I went.I knew going in this was a movie about snakes and Samuel L. Jackson was in it. Also, and more sensationally, this was about being on a plane!!! Think about it, you put yourself in a container with limited space along with people you don't know. These people have all the various disturbing personalities you can encounter in places that you can leave. You cannot leave a plane!!! SCARY stuff! OK, now for the review, this was a bad movie - a really, really bad movie. It was so bad it couldn't get any better. The dialogue was ridiculous; the acting for the most part was horrible; the scenarios were unbelievably unbelievable. I had no idea until today that so many negatives could be so funny when put together in one bad movie.It is not easy to fathom why Mr Jackson would put himself in a movie like this except for the possibility that maybe the casting team threatened to offer the part to Christopher Walken. I can imagine Walken doing this movie, so I am guessing Mr Jackson saw the potential for lost opportunity. Mr Jackson did the right thing. I had a great deal of fun watching him and I think he enjoyed making fun of the character style he usually follows.You have to drag yourself though the first part of the movie while you are dragged from one introduction to another. But these introductions prepare you for the rest of the movie. By the time you get to the action you are comfortable with the fact that this is not going to be your everyday ""horror/scary"" movie. When the action does start, you see the acting is bad and you have to know the actors know it. I don't think anyone, including the director, David Ellis, tried to cover any inadequacies. The movie almost reminded me of ""Airplane!"". I even thought maybe Leslie Nielsen might appear as Dr. Rumack.I really do not like most horror movies that have a lot of blood(you know, slasher style flicks), but I had a lot of fun with this movie.The best I can give it is a 7 of 10 but it was close to an 8.

Since Eddie Kim is tremendous vicious-man, so Sean's life is in danger. Thus come the FBI Special Agent, Neville Flyn (Samuel L.

You get, as the title says, snakes on a plane. Lots of them. Poisonous too! To top it off, the drug lord who is trying to kill the federal witness that Agent Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) is charged with protecting.The supporting cast is rather thin, because Jackson was a surprise lead who asked the director to be in the film, saying in interviews that this is the type of movie he always wanted to see on Saturday afternoons as a kid. A few studio execs had returned from a three-martini lunch, and, as is apparently custom in Hollywood, threw out some wild ideas in a meeting; one of them was to put killer snakes on a plane.My main problem with this movie is not with its plot, but its excessive use of CGI. Producers and directors are in love with CGI, even though its quality will always be inferior to using the real thing. While one can get away with CGI for convenience, such as with a car crash that is not central to the plot, the use of obviously fake ""snakes"" (apparently 25 of them were real but 400 were not) definitely detracts. Creative filming and judicious use of close-ups on the snakes would have led to a far richer film experience. On the other hand, the graphics have a bit of an Ed Wood appeal, so even there they get by.This is an unapologetic, old-school ""B"" movie of the type Jackson spoke of in interviews. Back in the old days, major stars would occasionally appear in films like this as a diversion, or for the same reason that Jackson appeared in this one.

The passengers have to work together to not only kill the snakes but to keep the plane working so they can land at their destination.When I heard about the film I thought it would not be interesting, how would it keep the audience entertained for 1hr and a half to two hours particularly as the action is taking place on a plane. I thought they couldn't pull it off but I was surprised at how inventive they were at moving the story along. It kept me riveted and I was never bored with how the film progressed.I think what helps the film is definitely Samuel L. Jackson's performance, he is the take charge guy who you cheer on to succeed and has some of the best lines and I just love his character.I do find the story far fetched that the bad guys were able to get as many snakes on the plane as they did and no-one noticed. It is also hard to believe near the end of the film that Troy (Kenan Thompson) can fly and land a plane with only his experience of playing on a computer game to rely on. I find that part very hard to swallow but so what, if you can overlook some of the idiotic things that happen, you will enjoy the film all the same because the pace is relentless and keeps you on tenterhooks.I think who ever came up with the snakes biting breasts, penis's and bums must have had sex on the brain. It was like the film makers were coming up with outrageous places that people could be bitten and legs, arms and heads were too boring and tame.The film is hard to believe, it isn't a masterpiece of film making that would get an Oscar but it is a film that entertains you from start to finish. It is very impressive how the writers came up with different scenarios for the snakes to kill people and for the passengers to battle them especially in the small space the film takes place in. I was surprised at how much I loved this film.",Snakes on a Plane
195,Robert_Hearth,"""Do As I Say And You'll Live!"" --- Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson)",8,11 March 2007,"""Snakes on a Plane"" (2006) Directed By: David R. Ellis Starring: Samuel L. Jackson, Juliana Margulies, Nathan Phillips, Rachel Blanchard, Sunny Mabrey, Flex Alexander, Kenan Thompson, Lin Shaye, Bruce James, & Keith Dallas MPAA Rating: ""R"" (for language, a scene of sexuality and drug use, and intense sequences of terror and violence) ""Snakes on a Plane"" was an instant internet phenomenon from the very first moment it was announced. In a matter of days, thousands of internet-users flooded blogs, websites, and video-hosting sites to chat about the movie and to upload their homemade trailers. This obsession lasted for months and hardly anyone was spared. But then, the strangest thing imaginable happened. All of the buzz justfizzled. It seemed as though ""Snakes on a Plane"" just went away. When it was time for the movie to finally open, critics (surprisingly) enjoyed it, but the movie received a rather disappointing greeting. When it left theaters, it had garnered $34 million domestically, barely eclipsing its $33 million budget (though, it fared much better in worldwide totals). But, the real question is: is ""Snakes on a Plane"" worth your hard-earned dollars? To my surprise and pleasure, I found ""Snakes on a Plane"" to be a perfect blend of horror, action, and comedy. Though not intelligent and more fluff than anything else, ""Snakes on a Plane"" is an entertaining movie experience that will bring more fun than most any other film this year.Sean Jones (Phillips) is a typical surfer dude whose life is thrown off course when he witnesses a brutal murder by legendary mob boss, Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson). Agent Neville Flynn (Jackson) is sent to escort Sean to California so that he can testify in the court case and put Eddie behind bars. But, Eddie has other plans. His ""henchmen"" put a crate of the world's most poisonous snakes onboard the plane and sets a timer that will release the snakes at a certain altitude. Soon, all hell breaks loose as the poisonous reptiles begin to run rampant and the innocent flyers are all the target of their fangs. The plot for this movie is shockingly simple. It is one of the very few in which the title, which consists of four brief words, sums up the entire movie. You know, there are certain movies that you watch for intellectual purposes, such as ""Munich"" and ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" just to name a few recent ones. Then, there are the movies you watch because you want a good, light, fun time with friends. ""Snakes on a Plane"" is one of the latter and it is an extremely effective one at that.""Snakes on a Plane"" is not a movie that relies on its performances. After all, this movie isn't called ""People on a Plane with Snakes"". Who cares if they can act when they are all being attacked and killed by hundreds of snakeson a plane? I know I don't, but, in all honesty, the performances are all competent enough. Samuel L. Jackson waswell, he was Samuel L. Jackson. He was a tough-talking, butt-kicking you-know-what who ripped through a bunch of snakes and spat out a few catchy one-liners. Sure, this was practically the same performance he put out in ""Deep Blue Sea"" (minus the glasses), but it worked here too. I kept expecting a shark to pop up and eat him, but, alas, a plane is not a good place to house a shark. Juliana Margulies also does a nice job, providing a sympathetic heroine and injecting more humanity into the role than the original script provided. I dug her a lot. Nathan Phillips, from the stellar ""Wolf Creek"", gives another good performance. He was fine here. Overall, the cast was suitable. They screamed, they killed snakes, and then most of them died--the end.Let's get this straight. If you go into a movie entitled ""Snakes on a Plane"" expecting the next great Oscar winner, then you have no business going into the movie to begin with. This movie is nothing but pure fun, though it isn't perfect. I can forgive the silliness of the initial plot, because, let's face it, the movie was very straight-forward about the silliness from the beginning. But, there are a few things I just cannot forgive, the most noticeable being the ending. If you've seen the movie, you know what I am talking about. If you haven't, then you will. It was just too over-the-top and reeked of the good-old cliché of always having some random passenger who can fly a crashing plane. On top of that, was it just me or was Samuel L. Jackson underused when it came to the snake-killing territory? Sure, when he got the chance, he ripped them to pieces, but it is most of the other passengers who get the real glory. Also, was it just me or did some of the special effects look a littleunpolished? None of them were really noticeably bad, but, upon my second viewing, I noticed that some of the snakes looked very cheesy. Did you know that snakes could leap up a few feet in the air to strike a person in the face? Yeah, me neither. But, when ""Snakes on a Plane"" ended, I left feeling energetic and excited. This is a fun movie and really, when everything was said and done, that is all that mattered.Final Thought: ""Snakes on a Plane"" is as much fun as the title suggests.Overall Rating: 8/10 (A-)",Snakes on a Plane
196,MrVibrating,Perfect popcorn movie,6,30 August 2006,"After nearly a year of steadily increasing and totally free Internet marketing, the hype was enormous. So naturally, everybody wants to know: does it live up to the hype? I say yes, definitely.If you're a fan of bad movies, you will have a great time at SOAP. It never takes it self seriously, and I cannot imagine what it'd be like if it did. There are tons and tons of CG snakes, all which hiss, roar and jump through the air. This is the best way to dispose of witnesses. Now, tell me how in the world this would ever been meant to be taken seriously.SOAP is probably best seen this summer, at a theatre. I doubt you will get the same feeling in two years on a rental DVD. Of course, I watched Blair Witch Project(another famous viral marketing movie) some five years after it's release and I still enjoyed it.The man with the plan(e), Samuel Jackson, basically IS the movie and he doesn't disappoint. He's got corny lines, moments of Pulp Fiction-ish staring and yelling, and basically a really cool attitude. The other actors vary, from the Paris Hilton bimbo(who's caricature in my opinion should have been meaner) who was pretty bland, to the smooth Kanye West-ripoff with his absurd and exaggerated hip-hop manners were really funny.All in all, I think this is a great movie. It does exactly what it promises, and that's rare.",Snakes on a Plane
197,GuyCC,Snakes On A Plane Is Exactly What It Is.,8,18 August 2006,"If you're a film or internet geek, you have already ridden the hype wave for this film for over a year now. At the San Diego Comic Con, the giant snake-mouth display and Sam Jackson's presence built this film to a fever pitch. Sure, there were great films like ""Superman"" and ""Pirates"", but ""Snakes on a Plane""? It was so cheesy, so off the wall, so ""it's so bad it's good"", you couldn't help but love it.The plot's minimal. The first 15-20 minutes in just exposition to get to the big show. I could have cared less about the mob guys, or the initial set up (I applaud the overly cheery intro music and the simple text logo appearing on the screen). It was like going up that first hill on a roller-coaster. You're so ready for that drop that you start laughing and getting fidgety for the action.Sam Jackson first bursts into the scene, the crowd went nuts. The plane takes off, the same. The big ""snake"" moment, it was like Christmas morning. And it never really stopped.It's cheese at its finest. It doesn't play itself up to be anything more. It's so unabashedly giddy in the catchphrases, clichés, gore, and everything else, that the audience spend the whole time laughing (and screaming - there are a few great jump moments), and waiting to see what absoludicrous situation would arise. It provided the adrenaline feeling that the original ""Speed"" once did, but with less wooden acting.And then Sam Jackson's infamous, fan-created line beginning with: ""That's enough...."" That was enough for the audience. The screaming, and quoting along with the line was pretty much unlike anything I've seen in a fan-given film before.It's the new ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"". I was almost surprised NOT to see people in costumes and throwing rubber snakes into the crowd. But I think it would eventually happen. This film knows exactly what it is, and makes no claim otherwise.If there's anything truly negative about this film, is that it will likely unleash a series of unoriginal and genuinely horrible (read: not funny) wannabe clones from other film studios trying to cash in this film's success. Honesty, I don't think you can. This film is a rarity in what it built up with the hype and fanbase. On the plus side, perhaps studios will start listening more to what the audiences want to make it a more satisfying and fun movie (this in itself comes with its own downside if they listen to the wrong demographic), but again, ""Snakes"" is just one of those things that happens and you get lucky with.For a maddeningly fun, no-brainer film, ""SoaP"" delivers by the crateload of snakes. Sam Jackson was a brilliant choice: The ultimate cinematic bad-ass in the most hopeless and over-the-top situation. I recommend it for a fun popcorn flick, and it's best seen while the hype is fresh and the theater crowds are huge.Along the way, I kept thinking this film would make for a great survival-horror video game....",Snakes on a Plane
198,timhayes-1,The title is the best part,6,10 February 2007,"Sankes On A Plane. Its a simple title. It tells you everything you really need to know about the movie. You have the basic premise. There's a cheesiness to it. Basically, you don't go into a movie with a title like that and expect it to be Titanic. For what it is, the film is amusing. Its a pleasant little distraction that will more than likely be forgotten in a couple of years. Really there's not much to it. Samuel L. Jackson is transferring an eyewitness who will help put a gangster behind bars from Hawaii to LA. Of course, said gangster arranges for hundreds of rare poisonous snakes from around the world to be released on the plane. If a snake doesn't get him, then the plane crash will. There are some great scenes that really jump out at you and the whole thing is competently filmed. Its just that the film could have been better. One scene in particular that stayed with me is a guy going for a leak and meeting a snake at the wrong end. Its a fear that most guys have and its well exploited. If you're bored, give it a shot.

199,deadsenator,"Oh, it's bad. Not good. Just...bad. Rating : 1 (but it deserves less)",1,23 December 2006,"Unless you are between the ages of 10 and 14 (except for the R rating), there are very few things to like here. One or two lines from Kenan Thompson, David Koechner (we really should see him more) and Sam Jackson are humorous and Julianna Margulies is as good as she can be considering her surroundings, but sadly, that's it. Poor plot. Poor acting. Worse writing and delivery. The special effects are dismal. As much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke, the significant individual embedded situations are all equally terrible. If we consider the action portions, well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you giddy and there are some that make you groan. This movie only contains the latter kind. This leaves little left. I'm so glad I did not pay for this.Despite any hype, I can read and think, so as I sat down to watch, I did not expect anything good. I had no expectations, but was somewhat worried going in. Yet, like a train wreck, one cannot merely look away. And even with no expectations, I was let down. Bad. Not even 'so bad, it's good' material. I'm _very_ tolerant of bad movies, but this makes ""Six String Samurai"" (which I liked) Oscar worthy.No, this piece of over CGI'd rubbish is in the same company as Battlefield Earth, Little Man and Gigli. How this is currently rated a 7.2 completely mystifies me. Brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all that I can think of as answers.I could go on and on but suffice to say that tonight, I witnessed a train wreck. I need to go wash my eyes. 1 of 10",Snakes on a Plane
200,ChiefGoreMongral,"Gore Mongral's Movie Review: The truth about ""Snakes on a Plane""",6,28 August 2006,"Word Up My Cameo fans out there, it is I the Gore Mongral back with another film to sink your teeth into. Speaking of teeth, todays review is about those Snakes on a Plane with ol' Sam L. (Mr.Jackson if your nasty). This movie has gotten so much pre release buzz I thought a swarm of bees had set up a hive in my hard drive. Besides the fact that those crazy reviewers over at IMDb have that movie currently at an 8.2 out of 10. Could the reviews be right? Lets take a look.Right off the bat you have to know that Snakes on a Plane is not going to be a serious film. That being said we know that the next possibility is good old cheese and we get a nice slice here. In a nutshell Sam has to fly with a witness of a murder to L.A to testify against a mobster. The mobster failing to kill the witness earlier in the movie creates one of the most mentally retarded plots to have the man killed (thank God though or there would be no movie). He gets a plane full of snakes to go crazy by spraying leis that the passengers have on their necks with a pheromone that causes the snakes to get ""horny"" and want to hurt someone. After a timed device releases the snakes all heck ensues.What do we get in this film. We get 2 Mile High Clubbers discovering a new meaning to ""Milking"" a snake, a guy who talks to his trouser snake then has it deep throated by a real snake and of source the now famous Jackson line ""I'm F'in tired of these Mother F'in snakes on this mother F'in Plane"".That in its own self are the highlights of this movie. There are a few other OK scenes but the problem is none come close to the fun cheese factor of those mentioned. Now that does not mean I did not like this film as it is a decent cheese flick. Unfortunately thanks to all the hype and the over inflated reviews it just really makes this movie not as good as advertised. Drop your expectations a notch though and you will be fine.After saying that I will say Snakes is best watched with a group of friends as it is definitely a crowd participation film. Go ahead and cheer and clap its OK ...its that kind of movie. Seeing it alone may slightly dull the experience but with the right crowd it will help. Think MST3K and you get the idea.In closing don't believe the hype...that much. Though some of it was entertaining and was fun blame the hype machine for creating a monster that did not perform up to its expectations. If you can drop your expectations alittle and grab some friends though you may have a good time with this cheesefest. My Score: 6/10: Above Average, better than the average cheese film but when compared to the hype that surrounded it Snakes does not live up to it. Don't let it deter you though! If your in the mood for some cheese and have some friends that are hungry for it too give it a stab.Sidenote: For a better slice of cheese from 2006 check out Slither, its a great retro cheese monster flick. Though not out on DVD yet once this and Snakes is released this would be a good double bill!!! Until next time Guys and Ghouls remember... do not use your organic gun as a snake lure ... that stuff hurts!!! I'm Out!!",Snakes on a Plane

That doesn't mean that it isn't a nice movie.I can really picture how this movie was created. I see a young script writer sitting in front of his computer screen, thinking about what the hell he has to create. Suddenly it dawns on him that it would be cool to have Samuel L. Jackson in the main role. So, what can we do with him?, he's thinking aloud. Something with snakes, maybe. Maybe I can put snakes in a confined space and let Jackson shoot them. That'd be so cool. A plane....snakes on a plane!!! WOW, this idea is the best thing since Quinten Tarantino made Reservoir Dogs. WOOHOO!!! The movie is as simple as its title, there are snakes on a plane and Samuel L. Jackson must save the day. That's all there is to it. No Oscar material, no art-house film exploring sexuality, just a complete over-the-top action flick with one of the coolest actors on earth and very badly animated snakes. And it worked for me. I laughed like a madman in the cinema.

It's alarming that mindless junk like this is part of the U.S. gross national product because it means American culture is buying it. It's disheartening to realize that a fine actor like Jackson is having a hard time finding good roles and that is, essentially, symptomatic of the downward spiral of quality not only in films, but in most of American goods and services.When I go to the video store, the walls are covered with films like this, the rabid drool of uncreative writers that infects movie watchers with the notion that this is what a movie should be like. Ignorance breeds more ignorance. All the while you are groaning in disgust or raising your eyebrows in disbelief, down deep you know you're watching tripe. This movie isn't campy enough to be funny; it is simply an excuse to show gross scenes one after another like the drip of Japanese water torture.

It almost feels like an 80's monster/disaster movie that was sent to the future and arrived in 2006(almost...one hint: Playstation 2). Snakes have always been a though sell in these kind of movies and while the CGI is poor(even using real trained live snakes would be too riské), the script and the acting are cheesy, but it seems they got this one just about right. The story is pretty straightforward: a young man witnesses a murder by a local mobster and saved by a cop, then they have to fly to Los Angeles for him to testify, but the mobster takes no chances and unleashes a hoard to deadly snakes, well..on the plane. Nothing fancy about the storyline apart from it's self-inflicted yet enjoyable mockery, don't expect too many surprises, though(most of them you've probably already seen them in other movies). The acting is an interesting element, Samuel L. Jackson seems like he's having fun and doesn't look bad doing anything in the movie. The remaining characters are walking/talking stereotypes(the blond with the puppy, the obsessed rapper, the video game junkie, the kids, the foreign guy with a foul mood and more) but you feel for them as they do a great job of pretending they are under attack by CGI snakes.

Jackson (a.k.a. The Man) gets fed up with the situation happening to him and yells ""Enough is enough! I have had it with these motherf***ing snakes on this motherf***ing plane!"", then you are not worthy enough to watch films ever again. Seriously, this movie epitomizes the concept of a ""so good, it's bad"" style, and you should be perfectly clear that this is what the film is, plain and simple.Basically, the plot involves a witness (played by Nathan Miller) who witnesses the murder of a prosecutor by a generic villain named Eddie Kim, and he ends up being hunted by a group of assassins, but is eventually saved by Agent Neville Flynn (played by Jackson) and is persuaded to go to Los Angeles to testify against Kim and put him in jail. Unfortunately, Kim has found out about this, and decides to put a box full of venomous snakes on board the plane in an attempt to bring it down, and yes, you guessed it, all sorts of mayhem ensues once the plane is halfway to it's destination. It's up to Flynn and the passengers to work together, keep the plane running and keep the snakes at bay while trying to figure out what the heck is going on.Pretty much every film stereotype that has appeared in an airplane movie is represented here. The comic relief, the reluctant passenger who has a special skill, the sacrificial lamb, the peppy attendant, a death in an airplane bathroom, people locked up in tight quarters, you name it, this film's got it, but then again, the film is supposed to be like this, so it's interesting to see how the film actually plays against those stereotypes (the married couple gets killed, the reluctant hero really doesn't have a special skill, etc.) When you go to a film called ""Snakes On A Plane"", you expect that there will be numerous snake-related injuries and snake deaths, and this film delivers in spades. Snake bites to every major part of the body, a snake eating a man(!), snakes getting tasered, toasted, microwaved, stomped, depressurized, and everything but the kitchen sink is in this film.There are also scenes that take place on the ground with a group of FBI agents (led by Bobby Cannavale) who are trying to figure out who put the snakes on the plane in the first plane, and personally, I thought the action on the ground was just as good as what was happening in the air.The acting and plot are actually pretty good for a film of this reputation. I went in expecting to see non-stop snake bashing for 2 hours, but it was actually kind of charming and funny in a way. Sure, there are numerous people who only serve to exist as cannon fodder for the snakes, but the main characters do good work with their parts, considering that their personalities are designed to be paper-thin.This is not a film to be studied and analyzed. If you see the word ""Snakes On A Plane"", that's what you should go in expecting. The only thing I would have liked to see was footage of the FBI busting Eddie Kim, because he is such a throwaway villain, and it would have been nice to see him get his ""just desserts"". Still, that's a minor quibble, as this film does things I didn't even expect. I mean, the final plan to get rid of the snakes involves depressurizing the whole plane! It's so ridiculous that it works, and I loved it.Bottom Line: Make no mistake about it, this film is snakes on a plane with Samuel L. Jackson, and that's about it. You should expect nothing less. I give this film a 10 out of, my highest rating, for being the most entertaining film experience I've seen all year. If you do go to see this, make sure it's with an audience who appreciates it's campiness as well. You won't regret it.",Snakes on a Plane
214,Surecure,Just a plain old good time!,7,18 August 2006,"Snakes on a Plane was destined to be either absolutely wonderful or absolutely terrible. I am happy to report it is without a doubt the former.This isn't a landmark film in terms of being a completely original concept... this isn't a film that is designed to take the ""art"" of film-making to new heights (pardon the pun)... this is exactly what it has advertised itself to be from the start: a joyride film where you can just sit back and be entertained.Make no mistake. This is straight up popcorn fare. But it is without a doubt primo popcorn fare! I haven't had this much straight up, no-nonsense, brain-set-to-chill fun in a theater in a long time. And I am so glad they went back and did the re-shoots they did in order to take this up to a hard R-rated film, because it obviously shows how that is exactly what this film needed.Don't go into this film hoping to see the next ""Citizen Kane"", because this isn't that kind of film. If you like Indiana Jones type adventure with the baddest bad-ass around -- Mr. Samuel L. Jackson -- then this is exactly what you are looking for. This film doesn't pull it's punches for fear of being outrageous. It throws its punches for the sole purpose of actually BEING outrageous. And by doing so it makes the film a roller-coaster joy ride.A lot of the time you hear the phrase, ""Don't believe the hype!"" With this film, trust me... believe the hype! You will not be disappointed.",Snakes on a Plane
215,aqua_swing,"A fine piece of cinematic history, kind of like Re-Animator",8,18 August 2006,"The thing about Snakes is that people forget it's not all in the name. Everyone is in on a joke. Everyone wants to tell you the joke as fun as possible. This is is the movie in a nutshell.Nobody cares about the plot holes, or even the most insanely crazy snake vision thing (yes, I said green-tinted snake vision). Nobody cares about the main characters besides Samuel L. Jackson, or the fact that we only see Eddie Kim (guy who puts snakes on plane) at the start of the movie, or the fact that some of the people on the plane are just as hilarious as Jackson's continued one-liners.Besides Sam Jackson, the flight attendants, and a few other random people, some of the other main characters have maybe two lines in the whole film, which I find kind of funny. There are LOADS, LOADS of one liner quotes throughout the ENTIRE film, some of them laugh-out-loud hilarious.Director David Ellis knew what he was doing. He knew exactly what crowd he was looking at for this movie, he knew exactly where to put the T and A. He knew where to put the jokes. He knew that having snakes bite people in obvious places would get viewers to laugh instead of cringe, and he knew how it would change the characters in the end.And you know, as bad as some people might say this movie was, that was kind of the whole point of the thing. But the difference between a terrible movie and a good B movie is that everyone associated with the film knows it's bad, and they end up having fun with it, which, in turn lets the viewer in on the joke.That's where it really counts. If you had seen a trailer and were not blinded by the internet fandom, thinking this might be some kind of serious film, re-think your options. This is campy and hilarious, the kind of movie it was supposed to be in the first place.",Snakes on a Plane
216,Baldrick44,Lived up to its name,8,25 August 2006,"Snakes on a Plane is a movie that could possibly see a new wave of filming come into progress- based on blogs and databases rather than studio heads and their enforcers. Having said that, how does the movie itself measure up? Pretty darned well, actually. The story revolves around a witness protection jaunt from Hawaii to LA, where Agent Neville Flynn ( Samuel L. Jackson ) is protecting a witness to a murder by a crime lord. Said crime lord however has an ingenious plan; fill the cargo hold with snakes, release female pheromones in the air to make them ultra-aggressive and watch the plane go down. Agreed, the plot is not a classic, but it isn't supposed to be- what makes this movie good is the eclectic bunch of supporting characters based on what seems like every single horror stereotype- including a randy couple, the newlyweds, the 2 small kids, etc, etc. Not to mention Samuel L. Jackson himself, who looks like he's having the time of his life, loving the chance to play hero through a Flying High gone wrong scenario. The snakes are also done in a cheesy but cool manner, with the death sequences being either very clichéd or very...creative. Snakes on a Plane will not win an Oscar. But it does lend itself to a laugh and an immortal line or two that'll live on for a long time.",Snakes on a Plane
217,IamtheRegalTreatment,"If you enter with low expectations, you'll leave happy.",6,17 August 2006,"Snakes On A Plane... possibly the most negatively anticipated movie ever. For a couple years now this movie had only bad messages, poor plot development, definitely a poor title and unsatisfactory acting (disregarding Samuel L. Jackson that is). Be honest, how well did you think this film would do after the rap sheet it received? I was one of the millions who thought Snakes On A Plane would be a huge disappointment. I hyped it up out of mockery, yet today I am glad I promoted the film and stuck with it for so long.I came in with low expectations of how well this film could possibly be and I left satisfied. I truly enjoyed this movie... no lie. It was completely entertaining regardless of the fact that there was a crummy storyline, acting flaws and critic schemes to hate the film. Knowing of how much of a piece of garbage this movie was supposed to be like, most movie-goers won't bother to give it a chance; that disappoints me.My suggestion is that most people should give this movie a chance. I liked enough that I might see it again before it leaves theaters. This is a good movie to go with a group of friends, even if you point and laugh at it. They always say ""don't judge a book by it's cover"", so don't judge these motherf#$@ing snakes on that motherf#$@ing plane until you sit down, relax, and watch it.",Snakes on a Plane
218,eched,"Smart, funny, sick in spots, and surprisingly original, in a campy way",10,1 September 2006,"Despite what you might of heard, this film is mostly cliché free.The only real cliché in the whole film is how two people that are making out get killed, and that's about it. The rest of the film is surprisingly original, but yet still feels campy, and because of the plot and name, and how it is so silly from time to time, still comes off as cheesy. But it was made to be cheesy. You are meant to sit back and laugh, not at, but with the film, as it pocks fun at itself. This is why the film is so fun and smart. It can do what few other films can, pick itself apart and point out the dumb spots, make fun of those dumb spots, and then move along. So, instead of the odd plot points bugging you, because of the films sense of humor they end up adding to the film.All of the characters are quirky and very original. Like I said, despite the campy feel, there is no real campy elements. There are no dumb teens running around being cut up by chainsaws. All the characters instead stand out and almost all of them are extremely likable. From the germ phobic singer who is trying to keep his phobia under-raps to keep his fame, to the clingy blond headed girl with the yapping pup and nobody to talk to. They all stand out and add to the film.The gore, when it does happen, is shocking in its creativeness and its bluntness. Almost as many people die from panic and running over each other as they do from getting bit by snakes. I.E. a girl is running over other people to safety and one of her high heels comes off and gets stuck right in one guy's head.No doubt though that gore is what some people have come to see. As for myself, I liked the silliness of it all. Everyone that made this film had a fun time doing so.In closing, you just got to be in the right mode for this film. I say see some of the Daily Shows jokes about it, or check out the music video. They'll put ya in the right state of mind.So, see and enjoy. If ya know that it is supposed to be dumb, then you'll love it. 10 out of 10",Snakes on a Plane
219,sullibrandon,Hilariously Fun Chaos,8,30 August 2006,"Beware: Snakes on a Plane is a perfect example of the kind of movie that is so bad it's good. Many movies have valiantly shot for this title, but to no avail. SOAP achieves it brilliantly, proclaiming boldly, in its title alone, even, that it is the type of entertainment that panders to audiences' often ridiculous desire for a complete lack of story, yet never really admitting that's what they want.The film opens with Nathan Phillips, played by a no-name B-actor, because of course the film budget could only call for one or two actual actors, and of course a starving SNL cast member (Kenan Thompson). Phillips witnesses a brutal murder by a dangerous mob boss, Eddie Kim, and as a result, is asked by Agent Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) to accompany him to California to stand trial against Kim. Having seemingly run out of every other option, the only thing Kim can do is release a crate of deadly snakes aboard the airplane that is carrying Phillips to California. ""Don't you think I've tried everything else?"" he cries in outrage at an underling who suggests there might be another way to deal with Phillips. Of course, if Kim can manage to sneak an entire crate (the crate is about ten feet high, six feet long, and six feet wide) aboard a plane, wouldn't it be easier to simply plant an explosive on the plane? As we learn, Kim doesn't care if everybody else in the plane dies. And if he has to plant snakes, why not plant all completely deadly snakes, instead of a variety whose kill ranges anywhere from two minutes to two days? Inconsistences like this, and the film's total disregard for a legitimate setup, are part of the movie's charm.The film features everything from snakes biting people on the boob, to the penis, to the....well, you get the picture. One couple, while having sex and getting high, gets surprised in the enclosed bathroom by a deadly viper, who seems to have an affinity for breasts. It was as if the director had a checklist of everything that makes a movie ""R."" ""Let' see, language, check, sex, check, violence, check.....what am I forgetting? Oh yeah! Drugs. Check."" Moments like these, which are so clearly intended to be completely ludicrous, work precisely because of it. This is not a movie that wants you to take it seriously. It wants you to just have fun and laugh at the way the snakes wreak havoc. The special effects of SOAP is nothing special. The snakes range anywhere from actual snakes to CGI snakes that look so metallic and fake you wonder if the filmmakers used a home computer to render them. SOAP isn't scary either. It's funny. There aren't very many times when a snake'll pop out of nowhere. Most of the time, you'll get a warning, either through seeing the snake rear up, or entering snake vision, wherein we see what the snake is seeing. (In case you didn't know, snakes see in tints of green.) There's all the cliché characters that make up the passengers. The stewardess who is hot for the witness, the stewardess who is on her last flight, the rap artists flanked by two bodyguards, the single Hispanic mother, the seasoned cop who has served for years alongside Neville Flynn (so of course you know he's going to die heroically and tragically), two brothers who are flying solo for the first time, the bubbly blonde with a chihuahua in her purse, and the business man character that everybody hates from the beginning, destining him for a cliché, if fun to watch, death. There are moments that are funny that are actually jokes in the movie, and those are pulled off okay, I guess. Kenan Thompson and his bodyguard buddy get a couple of laughs.Weaknesses? In a film full of weaknesses, and one that most definitely prides itself on this fact, I'd say the weaknesses of Snakes on a Plane would be in the way it catered to fanboy chatter on the Internet prior to the film. Originally, SOAP was intended to be PG-13, with minimal gore, virtually no sex, and only one f-word. The film was finished under these guidelines, but after over-hyped excitement, it was changed to include everything you see now, including Samuel L. Jackson's famous line, ""Enough is enough! I have had it with these motherf***ing snakes on this motherf***ing plane!"" However, as for the rest of the film, you can always tell where something has been added, and it negatively affects the film. Also, it has vastly minimized the audience. Without all the gratuitous everything, more people would have seen this intentional debacle of a movie.Despite these flaws though, I still found Snakes on a Plane to be an enjoyable so-bad-it's-good ride of a movie. I also learned several things from watching it. One, hot flight attendants will hit on you if you are a witness in a big case. Two, setting snakes loose on a plane is one of the best ways to kill a witness. Three, if Sam Jackson ever tells me to listen to him so I'll live, I'd better do it. Four, a flight simulator for PS2 is a perfect way to train for flying an actual plane. And finally, five, if I'm ever attacked by a snake, the first place I should protect is my crotch, even if the snake is near my head. Because it will go for my privates. Anyway, above all, Samuel L. Jackson is what makes this movie work. If it weren't for him, it would just be another lame Hollywood attempt at self-parody. Don't go into SOAP determined to over analyze it. Just have fun, laugh at how bad it is, and seriously, try counting all the clichés. I'd be interested to know the number.",Snakes on a Plane

I want my money back and the time I wasted on this garbage!",1,20 August 2006,"OK... so, I went to see this film because the movie we wanted to see was sold out and I was reading the comments from everyone on this forum and thought it might be a decent second choice; one question... which movie were you guys seeing? I was expecting some campiness, but this was just awful! The snakes were obviously CGI and when they were real, plain ole milk snakes/corn snakes! Weak plot, over the top acting and unnecessary goofiness with the ways the producers killed people! Of course the obligatory T&A sequence that I'm sure the actress baring her best assets will want to forget showing if she actually becomes a star! My wife and I really wanted to go see the 9/11 movie but it was sold out... I should have just waited a couple of hours because now I'm obligated to see 3 chick flicks to make up for this fiasco of a choice! Geez, this movie is gonna cost me more than I bargained for!! Don't see this movie, don't rent it out, don't waste your time if it comes on TV in the future... just let it die like they showed those people on the plane dying; fast and painful!!!!",Snakes on a Plane
222,LeroyBrown-2,Fun horror thriller,7,19 January 2009,"This is one of the most fun movies I have seen in a while. It's a horror B-Movie that's a throw back to the '50s horror movies where the monsters are literally jumping out at you. Except that this movie have dozens of snakes jumping at the poor victims. There is not much in term of blood and gore but there's definitely scary stuff especially if you don't like snakes even CGI ones.The premise is self explanatory. There are snakes on the plane, how it and why it was put there I wouldn't bother to say. Anyway the passenger manifest seems like a modern take on the Hollywood stereotyping, there's the pushy businessman, there's the annoying horny couple, the annoying sick couple, a couple of kids, a woman and her baby, a flight attendance on their last flight but then you add an heiress complete with a Chihuahua, a rapper and his entourage, and a jet Li lookalike. Yeah it becomes a guess who gets it next game.What I like about this movie is that it has tremendous energy and moves headlong into one catastrophic situation to another. From snakes getting into the plane's avionics to snakes threatening people by coming out of the plane's cracks and fissures. When the snakes were finally discovered then the panic and the fun REALLY get started. It's when you can't help but laugh at how ridiculous the situation is as everyone panic running around.I love how the camera follows the snakes as they slither through tight spots and how they move beneath passenger seats. Of course we see snakes attempt bites that are near misses, but they still make you flinch. Some of the snake attacks are obvious and where telegraphed, which means you expected them but some of those were really funny but incredibly painful to think about.Despite it being an obvious B-Movie, the actors played their parts real well. Samuel L. Jackson as the FBI agent is the same Samuel that he usually plays but he doesn't let up even though he knows this not Oscar material. So does Julianna Marguiles who plays one of the stewardesses. As a matter of fact all of the cast members completely professional and nobody just phoned in their performance.The snakes are obviously CGI for the most part they don't look realistic at all. There are a couple of question marks about this movie. How come there are only two people in the cabin operating a jumbo jet? Shouldn't there be a navigator also? Overall I think it was an enjoyable and fun film, the kind you watch while you're giving your brain a rest.",Snakes on a Plane

What can I say? John Heffernan and Sebastian Gutierrez (Screenwriters) are genius and I wish them a long, long career. The idea is so simple, yet so perfect.The acting, oh my!

I don't know how anyone going to this movie with this kind of cheesy title would expect a Lord Of The Rings type movie, but hey, if you go thinking that... you went in with a totally wrong attitude. You need but some screen over your lips so you don't collect any bugs from grinning like I did (and yes I did grin almost through the entire flick).First off, it's a B movie... one HELL of a B (no pun intended) movie. You don't get misty eyed, you don't end up wanting to boycott snake handlers, you don't even care if the bad guys get away with anything after a while. I personally was incredibly lucky. Not only did I hit the first daytime showing at the local Draft House here, I got to see people that came in Flight Captains uniforms and numerous babes in stewardesses outfits! Oh, and I also joined a crew that had been there since the midnight showing, and if they could last an additional 12 hours they got the entire day of watching the same movie over and over and over again free! Which made the delirium all the much greater. The guy sitting next to me politely informed me that he would not give anything away. I thanked him.From then on, it was one of the most enjoyable rides I have been on in for a while. OK, so you get a cheap-ass plot at the start of the show. You knew where it was headed from the beginning. It is NOT a believable plot, but hey, anyone that has sat through numerous episodes of any Godzilla moves knows it's not about the damn plot, it's about the mutha*bleep*ing SNAKES!!!! Yes, there were close to 375 real snakes used in this movie. But the ones kicking ass were CGI, and who really cares? CGI has come into such a form now that it is almost transparent. And seeing there were enough real snakes, it really doesn't help with the credibility of the film, but gives support for the incredible ride you get in the seats.There were yells of surprise, laughter, and for those seeing it already for the 6th time, had learned the parts in the film that they could join in chorus with: I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THE MUTHA*bleep*ing SNAKES ON THIS MUTHA*bleep*ing PLANE!!!! You knew the line was coming. I don't know of a Samuel Jackson movie where he either doesn't get killed or says that mutha word in at least a couple lines. But the stars? Snakes. They ruled the screen. And for those who are ophidiophobes, I would be happy to sit behind you in the theater, because screaming would only enhance the movie! In the end, I know this film won't win Oscars or any serious movie awards... but if today is only a sample of the people that are going to show up at this film, then I would say they knew exactly what the Joe Schmoe movie goer was looking for: Something so outrageously funny and thrilling and original that it almost puts many of the more serious movies to shame.Highly recommended. And is it OK if I stop grinning now? OK? Whew... I was afraid my cheeks were going to freeze in that position... can I take a break? You know, a little break now? Thank you!",Snakes on a Plane
225,mozli,Its hard to not be affected by the hype but this was fun,8,22 July 2008,"I feel this movie will never get a real fair shake. There was way too much anticipation and hype surrounding it. From the title you know that it is an absurd premise. It never backs away from that absurdity. Mr. Jackson and company deliver the goods even though there are a lot of new faces. The horror and gore is of the right amount and there's a lot of complaints here that the snakes aren't convincing looking. I know what a rubber snake looks like but I still get shaken when someone puts one on my desk. I think those folks are making something out of nothing. Yes, the idea of someone being that twisted to put a bunch a snakes on a plane makes everyone go,'oh please!' but the sickness to take an entire commercial jet down to avoid going to prison for life is definitely plausible. The really pleasant surprise in the film is Kenan Thompson. He may have a career after SNL. Of course Julianna Marguilles is always a welcome addition to just about any project.",Snakes on a Plane
226,rchrdshelt,Possibly the most fun I've ever had at the cinema! Prepare for a terrific thrill ride!,10,18 August 2006,"Having followed the hype for this film since it was announced, I, like many fans of the title and the phenomenon that followed was desperate to see this film as soon as it came out. Today was that day and I can tell you my expectations were completely blown away. The film not only lived up to its hype but actually was much much better than I thought it was going to be.The title says it all. You get plenty of Snakes, Samuel L Jackson on top form, nudity, hilarious one-liners, jokes and spectacular shock moments in just over 90 minutes. What more can you ask for? This film is pure entertainment from start to finish and really is one of the most fun films I've seen for a long time.With a relatively simple plot the film jumps right into the action and you'll never find yourself bored. I won't spoil some of the best moments of this film for you but all I will say is that its a film best viewed with a bunch of friends or in a packed cinema theatre. I saw it with my brothers today in a theatre and the audience laughed and jumped together. It really was a wonderfully exhausting experience.On the technical side, plaudits must go out to the incredibly underrated and very talented Director David R. Ellis. Having watched his previous action thriller Cellular a few months ago and thoroughly enjoying it, I was pretty sure this film would be terrific under his handling. I think I was right. Ellis does a terrific job here of building up tension and suspense by pulling in the audience and refusing to let go. He is certainly a guy who knows how to handle action and, on a relatively small budget, makes the film look like it was made for much more. He really is one to watch.The film is also well photographed and edited giving you a sense of claustrophobia and a you-are-there feel. The snakes also looked very good and I have to say they rarely seemed fake. The score is also dark and helps build up the tension.I was unsure whether or not to award the film a 10 first but why not? It is pure entertainment and thats the main thing that matters to me when I watch a film.WELL WORTH WATCHING AND CERTAINLY WORTH THE WAIT! 10/10",Snakes on a Plane
227,JWJanneck,A farce disguised as an action/disaster movie.,6,12 January 2008,"I started watching this opus with the expectation of being thoroughly annoyed by it, as reading the reviews it becomes obvious that those who loved the movie are the kind of folks that to me are the single most important reason for a home theater---easily amused young males, generous in sharing their views with the rest of the audience, willing to reenact every lame attempt at a joke several times right after understanding it. It is not difficult to see why this movie might play well with them, just as American Pie did---inane dialog, mammalian glands, senseless violence, macho hero, no plot. It is the kind of movie that gets better with more alcohol.But this movie has another layer to it. It is really a farce in the guise of a classical disaster movie, and it plays wantonly, and intelligently, with the rich cliché vocabulary of that genre. The fact that so many people seem to take it seriously is just another confirmation that reality is always one step ahead of satire.It starts with the cause of the disaster (the titular snakes), which is entirely ridiculous and quite original. I felt reminded of the Tribbles that gave Capt. Kirk some trouble. People behave and die in this movie in the most awkward and politically incorrect ways, even those that in classical disaster movies would be indestructible. The writers must have had a ball with constructing the disaster cast (which, in the classical manner, is introduced before and during boarding the plane)---the clean-freak rapper and his smart posse are a stroke of genius, so is the bimbo, and many others.So is this a great movie? It is alright, but not great. It is good as a farce, but it does not go much beyond that. Some of the story line is pretty useless, like the subplot in LA. And occasionally you wonder whether the movie wants to be a modern Airport (1970), or Airplane! (1980)---it seems that sometimes it is not entirely comfortable with just being farcical, and wants to actually create tension and serious action. Those pieces fail miserably, and will probably only be enjoyed by the segment of the audience maligned above, which is seems to pander to.In summary---it was not nearly as bad as I thought it might be, and it is quite funny, even hilarious at times. Worth watching.",Snakes on a Plane

The night after watching Snakes on a Plane, I dreamed of snakes slithering across the floor, chasing me. In that sense I suppose it accomplished its purpose.Oh, and anyone who considers Snakes On A Plane ""the most awful and ridiculous movie ever made"" (one reviewer's words) obviously has NOT seen Shoot 'Em Up.Still, there's enough here to make me regret picking this up from the video store.SoaP is mostly a thinly-plotted excuse for obviously-cgi, implausible nonstop reptile horror violence with some sex thrown in just for good measure. You get the feeling that they would've put 3 or 4 more sex scenes in to further titillate the audience if they could have - they just couldn't work out any way to do it without it being even more blindingly obvious they were skating on some very thin plot. This movie is a blunt instrument. If you like being awkwardly bludgeoned with blunt instruments, go for it. Personally, I prefer tales that have a bit more finesse.A lot more finesse, actually.To be fair, they obviously put a lot of thought into trying to come up with just about everything that could possibly go badly if you were to release a huge box of (implausibly aggressive) deadly snakes on an airplane. Unfortunately, that just wasn't that hugely winning a concept to start with. Some concepts just aren't. Maybe we should make an entire movie about zits on a nose. No? Snakes on a plane does beat zits on a nose, but not by *that* much.The concept's bad, the execution's bad, and the script's not that great either. The main thing this movie has going for it is Samuel Jackson, whose career will hopefully recover. Jackson's presence lifts this tale from a ""3"" to the heights of ""4 out of 10.""",Snakes on a Plane

Are you joking?,7,24 December 2006,"I wanted to see ""Snakes on a Plane"" about 5 months and I finally watched, but... it was not good as I was expected. Idea was great, but plot was not interesting, just a little bit boring :( .In this movie Samuel L. Jackson looks not very good actor. He's words ""Enough is enough! I have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!"" sounds very stupid. Other actors acted good, even Lin Shaye do a great performance.Except boring plot, this movie is still a good movie, but not worth to watch a second time. 450 snakes looked very awesome in this movie, so I give 7 for original idea.",Snakes on a Plane

It's for sure a mixed bag with people. Some love it while others don't. I personally thought it was ok but didn't love it or hate it.Samuel L. Jackson (Neville Flynn) carries the film as he was the best part. He played his character well and was likable. His dialogue was great too. None of the other cast stands out but was fine in their supporting roles like Julianna Margulies (Claire Miller), Nathan Phillips (Sean Jones), and Kenan Thompson (Troy). They could've done a much better job with the snakes as the CGI was so laughable and I couldn't take it seriously.The film is completely unrealistic but after a while, you start to laugh when you realize how unrealistic it truly is.Overall, I'll give ""Snakes on a Plane"" a 6/10.

It has it's funny parts and it has it's thrilling and entertaining parts! IT'S a fun movie, to watch with a big group of people and all of your friends! This is a huge amount of fun thanks to inventive, fast-paced direction by David R. Ellis (who made last year's equally trashy-but-enjoyable Cellular) and a terrific performance by Jackson. It's fair to say that no film has ever delivered so completely on its premise as Snakes On A Plane and for once the pre-film hype turns out to have been justified. You could make a list of things you wanted to see in Snakes On A Plane and the film would almost certainly deliver on all counts. Snakes attacking a couple during the application process for the Mile High Club? Check. Snakes attacking from the toilet? Check. Samuel L Jackson attacking the snakes with a tazer? Well, now you're just spoiling us. The supporting cast (including Rachel Blanchard as a thinly-veiled Paris Hilton clone and Julianne Margulies as a resourceful flight attendant) are excellent and there's a lot of fun to be had in guessing which of them will end up as snake fodder. The script is packed full of quotable lines - Oh great. Snakes on crack! but Ellis gets the tone exactly right, never descending into farce, despite the clearly ridiculous premise. Hugely enjoyable, unashamedly trashy thriller that works perfectly, delivering shocks, scares, laughs and cheers in equal measure. Oh and snakes. Lots of snakes. On a plane. Put simply, this is quite possibly the most fun you'll have in the cinema all year. If you like the title, you'll love the film. Highly recommended. so go to the video store and rent/buy snakes on a plane because - SNAKES ON A PLANE ROCKS! highly recommended p.s - while your there why don't you rent it's little rip off movie called snakes on a train!",Snakes on a Plane

Hell its camp/cult heaven, and one of the first films in years to truly deserve cult status.

Dumb your brain down to the lowest level it will go to, and you will still drastically overthink Snakes on A Plane, the hilariously over-the-top horror/comedy from the folks behind ""Final Destination 3"".You will know what you think of this movie from square one. The film starts with a biker riding through a postcard-perfect Hawaii, backed by the easygoing soundtrack and swirling camera. But the biker's thrill is interrupted when a bloody body drops into the frame. He runs and hides as a mobster beats the victim to death with a baseball bat as blood squirts and shoots all over the place.If you come into this film prepared for a serious scarefest, you will be disappointed.However, if you've come to see bad-ass Samuel L. Jackson get some deadly-ass snakes off a deadly-ass plane, you've come to the right place.When the FBI try to take the biker (and murder witness) into protective custody, the murderer unleashes a crate of exotic snakes on Pacific Flight 121's unsuspecting passengers.From the moment the first snake crawls in through an open hole in the lavatory, the filmakkers know what they are aiming for; low-level frat-boy humor and thrills. And thats exactly what we get; 90 minutes of snakes eating puppies, snakes biting children, snakes wriggling down the eyes and ears of the unsuspecting passenger. And, of course, it wouldn't be a Samuel L Jackson movie without screaming damsels,F-bombs, and a standoff with one bad-ass boa constrictor.Lower your expectations. Go in with a smile. I guarantee you will leave with one.",Snakes on a Plane

With a little bit or horrific eating, biting and scary scenes to scare your pants off. Didn't quite get the make-out session in the bunker, but whatever floats the directors boat I guess. The soundtrack sounds appealing to the theme of snakes of a plane. Quite a different approach with the rock-band theme playing approach, but well executed. The main character played my Mr. Jackson was well played out and professional. The film is quite graphic for younger audiences so do bare this in mind before taking young children in. Overall not the best movie of the summer when compared to pirates 2, but still an original work of Horrer art that is great for a pop-culture following as it has already received.

236,sheepmonk2000,"""snakes on crack""",6,17 June 2011,"During the initial introduction to the various characters in this movie the film comes off a little derivative of other flicks of this ilk, as each actor plays somebody we've all seen before in other disaster/catastrophe movies such as Independence Day and Deep Impact. The film also uses some clichéd dialogue and while the acting is fine overall, Samuel L Jackson plays his part a little too over the top for my liking. However, in saying this I think the film is supposed to be a little over the top in general, and if that was it's objective it succeeds very well indeed. The computer generated snakes work well, and there are some great jumpy moments and the film features some inventive slaying by the snakes as many of the passengers fall victim to their anger. The film is funny too, and along with the killings it boasts some great action sequences and is quite suspenseful too. So to conclude, expect a film with it's tongue firmly in it's cheek and also be ready for what quite surprisingly turns out to be a considerably thrilling movie. 6/10 (3*).",Snakes on a Plane

239,brodie_kashmir,"Pure action, pure thrills, pure fun",9,31 December 2006,"Once in a great while along comes a film that is the next big ""cult classic"". Snakes on a Plane is that film for this generation. But it has defied all logic of the cult classic. It had a strong following before it was even released. Scratch that - before it was even done filming.A year ago fans caught wind of a new film with the simple and obvious title Snakes on a Plane, or SoaP as it became affectionately known as, and latched onto it to create the biggest internet sensation since 1999's Blair Witch Project.SoaP is about just that- snakes on a plane. FBI Agent Nelville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) has been assigned to escort surfer Sean Jones (Wolf Creek's Nathan Phillips) from Honolulu to Los Angeles after Jones witnessed crime boss Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson) murder a district attorney. In order to keep Jones from testifying, Kim orders the release of several crates full of the most poisonous snakes from around the world on Pacific Air flight 121. Agent Flynn has to keep the passengers and crew, and particularly Jones, safe from the deadly reptiles at 30,000 feet above the ocean.Critics and non-Soapaphiles were quick to push this into the ""so-bad-it's-good"" category, but I doubt their commitment to the sheer enjoyment of this film. Because that's where it succeeds. SoaP is an unpretentious action thriller that delivers on all counts. It's a pulse pounding thriller that keeps you guessing as to who will live and who will die (though the archetypal minor characters are there to provide us with good death scenes). The action is never over the top and always exciting. And the comedy is never displaced. It's always funny when it intends to be, and serious when it needs to be.One would want to question what A-list actor Jackson is doing in a presumably B-list film littered with B and C-list actors (David Koechner and Kenan Thompson of ""SNL"" and ""ER's"" Julianna Margulies are the next most recognizable people). But Jackson is always the consummate actor, never turning down a role because work is work no matter how prestigious the gig. As an added bonus it shows he has a sense of humor. In a recent interview on Comedy Central's ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" he claimed he signed on to star after only seeing the film's title in a trade magazine, having never seen a script.I found no real flaws in the acting. Nothing award worthy or having a significant impact on the craft of acting, but nothing inherently wrong with it. Everyone was in top form.Let's give credit where credit is due- director David R. Ellis (Cellular and Final Destination 2) and screen writers John Heffernan (debut) and Sebastian Gutierrez (Gothika). As many view this film as a bad film that screams cheesy, it could have easily been handled as such. The film could have elicited more groans of annoyance than cheers of excitement. But it wasn't. It was taken seriously enough to not take itself too seriously, and keep it tight and cheese free.The unambiguous-ness worked in its favor as well. Last year was littered with metaphoric titles that had to be deciphered in order to understand the movie, or they had little to actually do with the main plot. But when you walk into a movie called Snakes on a Plane, you know exactly what you're getting.I can't imagine a time when I had that much fun sitting in a movie theatre watching a film. There was an excited energy in the air as the crowed awaited the now iconic line- ""I've had it with these mutha-******' snakes on this mutha-******' plane!"" and proceeded to shout along with the screen. Part of the enjoyment of the film comes from that very collective experience, but the quality of the film is separate from the viewing experience.",Snakes on a Plane
240,canadian58,Surprisingly good,6,2 April 2013,"When this movie came out, I thought it looked awful right from the get-go. The title was corny, as was the whole idea. I could tell you the whole plot without even watching the movie: a bunch of poisonous snakes get loose on a plane, and go on a rampage. Now, I like corny horror flicks, but this seemed a bit much, even for my standards. So I avoided seeing it.Now, years later, I accidentally flipped by it on cable. Figured I'd give it ten minutes or so, and then go on to something else. But to my surprise, it held my interest long enough to get into the action scenes, and was gripping up until the end. Most of the movie takes place inside the airplane, but that doesn't take away from the amount of action here, which there is lots. There are many intense, frightening scenes, and gobs and gobs of snakes. What is also surprising is that not everyone on the plane is a complete idiot, as is usually the case in this type of horror film. There's even a bit of hilarious dialouge mixed into it all.My favorite part was how Samuel L. Jackson finally rids the plane of the remaining snakes.Kenan Thompson is always hilarious, and his role in this is no different.Overall, a weak plot, but good acting and lots of action hold this movie together. Not the best movie in its genre, but well above average.",Snakes on a Plane

If so, Snakes On a Plane delivers all you could want.There is no point in summarizing the plot. Somehow, hundreds of exotic, venomous snakes get onto a jumbo jet and terrorize the passengers. Again, if you still don't get it, this film is just not for you.I must admit, ever since I first read the title on IMDb oh-so many months ago, I have been eagerly awaiting its release. Snakes On a Plane. So simple, so blunt, so wonderfully absurd  so brilliant. SOaP is pure marketing genius. I waited and waited for what seemed like an eternity Then the soundtrack was released. I was crushed. Panic! At The Disco? Fall Out Boy? What kind of moron allowed this filth to poison my beloved SOaP? I was outraged, and my anticipation had suffered a major blow. Still, I remained cautiously optimistic. The Cee-Lo Green track at least gave me a little hope.Then, finally, at long last, August 18th arrived. And let me tell you, SOaP is pretty much perfect. From the opening baseball bat murder, to Samuel L. Jackson's incredibly fitting ""Do exactly as I say if you want to live."" introduction, to Samuel L. Jackson's incredibly fitting closing line, those lovable CGI snakes tore my worries to pieces, much like how they did everything else in sight.SOaP is everything it should be. It's stupid, violent, ludicrous, hilarious, and above all, fun. And the fact that Samuel L. Jackson is in his most purely badass role since Pulp Fiction doesn't hurt, either. It's been a long time since we've had a truly whacked-out, senselessly violent, one-liner-spewing action comedy. True Lies was essentially the last of the breed, and even that was more of a conscious parody of such films. But Commando fans should rejoice, for Snakes On a Plane catapults the genre back into its glory days, and it is arguably the best film of its kind since that 1985 gem of repressed homosexuality.Oh, and that music thing. Don't worry; it's only orchestral score until the end credits, as it should be.There are only three things I can think of that would improve SOaP. 1. Get rid of that awful music video during the end credits. 2. Change Samuel L. Jackson's character name to Samuel L. Jackson. 3. The bloodshed could have been turned up just a bit more. Where were all the arterial snakebite sprays?But those complaints are minor, and the second one is, admittedly, pretty stupid. But stupidity is what SOaP is all about!All in all, Snakes On a Plane is the most unbridled fun I've had and am likely to have at the movies this year, and it's probably the best and most entertaining B-movie in years.",Snakes on a Plane

243,jon2005,Snakes on a Plane,6,4 April 2007,"Samuel L Jackson took the role of Neville Flynn, a special agent who takes witness Sean Jones (Phillips) on a flight to LA during which a crate of the world's most venomous snakes are released in order to eliminate him, based solely on the title. He thought it sounded pretty cool. There's not much room for error here  the film is about snakes on a plane. With such a blatant B-movie title, expectations can be left at the door  it's hardly likely to be a deep, emotional picture, especially with the director of Final Destination 2 and Cellular at the helm. The hype surrounding Snakes on a Plane was enormous; it didn't just catch Jackson's eye but half the internet seemed obsessed with the film, mostly based on just the title. Therefore the question is: can the film live up to fan's expectations?Well, of course it can. Because anyone going to see a film called Snakes on a Plane are going to want to see snakes, gore, and Samuel L Jackson being cool  all of which the film has in spades. It also has its fair share of humour, and the success of the film lies within its title it's not a serious film, it's probably going to be quite clichéd, and yet it knows this and plays around with it. So you have all the glorious clichés laid bare (main character becomes reluctant hero; Spanish mother whose baby gets into jeopardy; the flight crew's last flight together; arrogant character gets come-uppance; the list is almost endless), but enjoys itself so much in using them that you almost forget that they're clichés, and instead just roll with it. It is clearly a film that has its tongue very firmly in its cheek. There are a fair amount of scares  albeit of the jump at the screen with loud noises type, rather than the thick, close atmosphere type  which merely adds to the excitement. The snakes themselves are scary as hell, especially as they can move around the plane at will, whereas the passengers are trapped in certain parts. What really gets the cringes going is the places in which the passengers get bitten; it's just not as scary to be bitten on the hand/arm when instead you can be bitten anywhere on the face or groin. You name a place you really wouldn't want to be bitten, and the film will feature it in glorious close up. Tongues, eyes, nipples, asses  it's got them all. What keeps the film going is the relentless pace. There are no quiet, reflective moments here; once the snakes begin to move it's a constant fight for survival that does not let up until the final moment. The film thrives on adrenalin. Also going for it is the outrageously daft and hugely entertaining script  never have lines like ""Get this snake off my ass!"" or ""My brother from another mother"" been so funny, or as immortal as Jackson's ""I have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!"" Quite simply, the film works, and probably would only work, with Jackson leading. He's just brilliant, and effortlessly cool.Snakes on a Plane certainly won't change the face of film-making. It may be unprecedented in its fan's involvement in making it, but it is in essence a popcorn movie. Then again, it's the kind of film that ""popcorn movie"" was designed to describe. It does exactly what you want it to do, and does it unashamedly. And for that, no one should miss out in seeing it. Rated: 8/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",Snakes on a Plane

I could watch ""Anaconda"" and ""Deep Blue Sea"" over and over. I have no problem with B-movies. Some of them I love.That being said, ""Snakes on a Plane"" is a mean-spirited dud. Surprisingly gory and predictably plotted with characters that we don't care about. The movie also commits the usually unforgivable sin (SPOILER ALERT) of having a novice land a jet.(END) What does this movie have going for it? A fantastic title and Samuel L. Jackson. The rest of this unwieldy genre in-joke will be tedious for those who aren't trying too hard to love it. I saw it in the ideal circumstances: a late-night opening weekend crowd full of folks who have been anticipating this movie for months. They were demonstrably stoked. If critics were seeing this movie in a vacuum--without any knowledge of the hype--the reviews would be far less kind. Liking this movie right now is akin to smoking in high school.What killed this movie for me? It takes forever to get on the plane. The opening twenty minutes are unforgivably awful, no fun, and immediately prepare you for the hack job you are about to witness. The gore in this movie is intense, out of place, and gratuitous: (SPOILERS)a man being trampled to death gets a high heel right in the ear then writhes in pain, several folks get impaled after falling off a staircase, snakes jump into throats and eye sockets.(END) This film should have been a goofy romp and may have worked if it had been able to remain buoyant, but the gruesome violence clashes with the feel good moments and intentionally laughable dialogue. Tonally, this movie is a mess. Also, the CGI is pretty horrible and the snakes ridiculous.

It's only good if you take great glee in making fun of it and everyone around you is in the same state.I'm guessing the enjoyableness of watching this movie will decline drastically once the drunken, mocking crowds have had enough.

Maybe a nerdy snake geek on board the plane, who could've dispensed questionable information to humorous ends.

We've seen ""Anaconda"" and ""Anacondas: Hunt for the Blood Orchid."" What else could they put in a snake movie? Snakes are deadly. They are going to kill people. Well, they threw Samuel L. Jackson in the movie and what may seem like just a simple, stupid snake movie to some can be interpreted by others as a story with character development with snakes as a subplot. My second viewing of the movie turned out that way.The movie starts of with Sean (Nathan Phillips) seeing a murder by a notorious gangster in Hawaii. After the mobster finds out where Sean lives, hero FBI Agent Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) comes to the rescue. After escaping henchmen once, Flynn tells Sean that he can either get killed by the gangster or come testify in Los Angeles. Sean takes the second choice and Flynn and Sean take the red eye to LA. Little do they know that the gangster has put a variety of poisonous snakes on the plane. When the plane lifts off, the snakes come out causing some gruesome deaths. And of course, its up to Neville Flynn to save the day.But as the snakes keep coming, the people keep fighting and there's a scene where they almost sound like one big fighting family. So despite this movie having a cheesy title, its actually not that bad at all. Supporting roles from David Koeschner and Keenan Thompson bring some comedic moments to the movie. But beware, there are gruesome scenes in this movie and it is not for everyone. But it is better than both ""Anaconda"" movies. So if you're looking for a decent snake movie, see this one.

Rarely have I enjoyed a film so much and yet hated myself for liking something so much. What a gloriously, delightful film. What a horrific, poorly directed, piece of trash. What a great title for a film. What a stupid, obvious title for a film. I can't believe how much I enjoyed seeing a man's genitals get bit by a snake. I can't believe how incredibly stupid the opening of the movie is. I can't believe the amount of product placement for Red Bull. I can't believe the ending of the film doesn't resolve any conflict.

Seriously, it's a lot of fun, though not in the sense most people are expecting. Rather than being a full-on parody the so-bad-it's-good horror film, it really is a so-bad-it's-good horror film, with a very tiny bit of campy humor thrown in almost as an afterthought. Almost everything about it is poorly done: the ending comes without a climax, the scenes of snake attacks are poorly paced and drag on until they become a bit boring, even Samuel L Jackson seems to be half-hearted about his performance.However, in terms of being a bad horror movie, it's top notch. Snakes growl, breasts are bared, heads are crushed. See it with a group, cheer for Sam, announce SNAKE VISION every time you see it, and you'll have a blast.",Snakes on a Plane

The dialogue is weak; the jokes aren't that funny; the product placement is annoying; and, Samuel L. Jackson's performance isn't anything special. If there were more lines like the classic ""motherf***in' snakes"" line, the movie would have been a lot better. It is ironic that that line - probably the funniest in the movie - was supposedly written by some blogger from cyberspace. The rest of the script, written by ""professionals,"" was pretty terrible. As others have said, the CGI was bad and the plot was weak. I personally think that ""Anaconda"" was WAY better and funnier; and the snakes looked better.Don't believe the internet hype (that has clearly affected the IMDb rating as well).

I rented it out from video ezy last night and i can tell you it was worth watching but as i said in my summary you are an idiot if you take it seriously. Snakes on a plane was original but also stupid as well as funny to watch as snakes attempt to swallow passengers and snakes going through peoples eyes. Though i did like Nathan phillips acting he did not say much and he had a fairly good American accent but it was good to see the yanks putting Australian talent into there films and as for a finished plot well that never happened.,Snakes on a Plane
256,SteakSalad_101,The worst movie I've ever seen. I LOVED IT!!,5,3 September 2007,"Seriously, just say the title to yourself. Slowly--one word at a time. Go ahead, no one's watching. Snakes...on...a...plane. Can you do that without laughing? I know I can't.What started out as an EXPLOSIVE internet phenomenon in spring 2006 became a legend by August. And unless you've been living under a rock for the last year and a half, you'll definitely know something about Snakes On A Plane. When the story surfaced, I thought it was such a genius idea for a brainless summer popcorn movie, became a regular on the IMDb board for a bit, got an official T-Shirt at Hot Topic, and, unfortunately, didn't get a chance to see it when it opened on August 18th. Well, last night I sat down with a friend at 1:30 in the morning with a can of Rockstar, popcorn, and french fries and put the movie on, truly, completely not knowing of what was about to be thrown in my face.As you can probably imagine, Snakes on a Plane is about...well...snakes on a plane. A teenager witnesses a brutal murder in Honolulu, doesn't do anything, and Samuel L. Jackson as a super-cool FBI agent must escort him to LA to testify. But the murderer wants this witness dead--so he releases deadly snakes on the plane to make sure he dies.The film is basically made up of people getting killed in the most random and outrageous ways imaginable by this ASTOUNDINGLY unrealistic movie, and Samuel L. Jackson killing the snakes and trying to protect the passengers. Hilarity ensues--I laughed throughout the whole movie. The dialogue is absolutely ridiculous, badly written, super-corny, yet excruciatingly funny. Kenan Thompson portrays a video-game addict passenger who attempts to fly the plane and the whole thing is just really, really funny.Aside from that, being honest--S.O.A.P is without a doubt the WORST movie I have ever seen. Ever. It has no story, it's extremely corny (even the scenes without the snakes), makes you want to kill yourself, it's terribly acted, and everything else bad you can think of. Yet, there's a little voice inside you protesting, insisting you watch the rest of Samuel L. Jackson beating the crap out of poisonous snakes. While it is the worst movie I've ever seen--I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. I know this is an over-used, worn-out expression, but this is really the only film I've ever seen where it 100% applies--Snakes on a Plane is SO bad, it's good. It makes for a fantastic laugh and it's a healthier alternative to drugs to forget all your problems and worries and just enjoy a night of watching snakes kill people on a plane. Overall, the ULTIMATE summer party movie. It's original as hell, side-splittingly funny, and 100% awesome--yet it's also the worst film ever produced.The only problem is, I have no idea whether I give this movie 10 stars or 0 stars. So I've decided on half and half--a 5.Just see this movie. SOAP will undoubtedly go down in history as a cult classic.",Snakes on a Plane
257,adudewhoiscool,instant cult classic,10,9 January 2007,"What should be said about ""Snakes on a Plane?"" Is it enjoyable? Is it recommended? With arguable the most internet hype ever, is ""Snakes on a Plane"" worth that hype. Was it a disappointment or an instant cult classic? Well, you will have to read this review to find out.Sean Jones witnesses a murder at the hands of crime lord, Eddie Kim. After a failed hit on Jones' life, Federal Agent Nelville Flynn convinces Sean to testify in Los Angeles against Kim and help put him behind bars forever. In order to get to that grand jury, Jones and Flynn must fly across the Pacific Ocean, but Kim and his men try to prevent that by taking the plane down with the help of poisonous snakes hidden in the cargo area. Anarchy erupts and blood is splattered. There is now a war of man (and woman) vs. snakes 30,000 feet in the air. Who wins? Watch this movie to find out.""Snakes on a Plane"" was horrible, yet at the same time completely amazing. Your movie experience will be one of the most fun times you will have. The idea of making this movie ""so bad it is great"" really worked. This film is loaded with as many clichés as you can think of for both action and horror films of the 1980's and 1990's. The visuals were horrible. There are holes in the plot that are so obvious even people who do not look for any will find them. All of the characters were stereotypes. What makes ""Snakes on a Plane"" stand out so much is that the makers know of all of the films flaws, but instead of trying to correct by pointless explanations, they just add more.The acting is also very mediocre. Samuel L. Jackson was the star of this film as Neville Flynn. Julianna Margulies was a flight attendant named Claire Miller. This movie also centered on Sean Jones, played by Nathan Phillips. Rachel Blanchard played a Paris Hilton wannabe named Mercedes. Flex Alexander played a rapper named Three G's. David Koechner played one of the flights pilots, Rick. Even Kenan Thompson shows up as Three G's bodyguard, Troy. It truly looks like everyone had a blast making this film!Overall, if you are up for it, you will love ""Snakes on a Plane."" ""Snakes on a Plane"" is an instant cult classic. There is not anything bad to say about this movie. It was everything expected. You should expect snakes, you should expect a plane, you also expected the snakes to be on the plane, and lastly you should expect Samuel L. Jackson. What more could you have asked for? If you want to watch a movie purely for the fun aspect, watch ""Snakes on a Plane"" with a group of friends. This movie is easily recommended!",Snakes on a Plane
258,richard-810,Absolute Trash,1,8 September 2007,"This is actually the first time that I've been prompted to leave a bad review on the IMDb. If a film doesn't grab me, I don't tend not to waste time writing about it, preferring to reserve my comments for those movies deserving of praise. This however was so bad that I felt obliged to warn others not to waste their money or their time. The other fact that amazes me is that some people seemed to like it and that it has drawn half-decent reviews in some quarters. The plot is ridiculous. If you were a criminal and wished to kill a hostile witness, can you imagine a more absurd method than to put a huge variety of poison snakes in a box with a timed release, put the box in the cargo hold of a plane and hope that the snakes got your victim while munching their way through the other passengers? OK you might think, silly plot but it could be fun if carried off with sufficient style. Forget it, the characters are the most two-dimensional stereotypes I've seen in recent years and mostly pretty bad actors. What Samuel Jackson was dreaming of when he got involved in this abomination is impossible to imagine. However much they were paying him wasn't enough for the humiliation. I like the occasional trash movie as much as anyone if it's done with a little aplomb and humour but if you're more than 10 years old, this is an insult and a plain bad movie. It made me angry, hence this review!",Snakes on a Plane

Anyone who sits down to watch this movie knows what they're getting into! Never has a title summed up the plot, the character, or the quality of a film like ""Snakes on a Plane"".The plot is as good as you'd expect. One of the characters even acknowledges how far-fetched the storyline is: ""What kind of crazy plan is that?"" The acting is good. The jokes are good.

260,ArmsAndMan,Nothing New Under the Sun... but sometimes all you need is the beach,8,20 August 2006,"This was pure popcorn fun at the movies, and I suggest you see it now, in a theater, preferably late at night. The audience reaction is half the charge.Samuel Jackson is great, but so is Julianna Margulies. Excellent casting. Both play it straight, which makes the fun funnier, and scares scarier. The only weak link is in the direction. Scenes of potential fear and anxiety often fizzle out because the filmmakers don't have the chops of a true suspense master, a Hitchcock or DePalma. But that's a quibble.There's plenty more that works than doesn't, and the best surprises come in the unexpected quieter moments. Characters who start off as mere types become, to my surprise, almost dimensional by the end of the ordeal. And when specific characters succumb in the third act, the laughter has died out too, because against all odds, we've come to care for these people who had the misfortune to travel on this @#$%^&*%^&* plane.",Snakes on a Plane
261,forindcine,Surprisingly entertaining,7,23 October 2006,"OK, you can stop laughing long enough to read this recommendation. Yes, I know - even I consider myself a ""film snob"" so imagining me having a desire to see this film surprises me too! Let me explain. First, some trusted friends told me they had a ""good time"" with this film. Next, I gave an acquaintance a copy of my last recommendation and they stated they really wanted my review for Snakes on a Plane. But the thing that really got my attention was when my 80-year-old mother and brother, who are seldom seen in movie theaters, shared how much they enjoyed this film.Finally, I was reminded of my favorite saying, ""Emancipate yourself from mental slavery."" Not to mention the fact that I'm a former flight attendant and 30-plus year veteran of the ""plane"" business. So I decided to put on my huge Afro wig disguise and sneak into a weekday matinée hoping no one would recognize me.The result: Snakes was wonderfully entertaining. The plot is in the title and Samuel Jackson plays Samuel Jackson. But, if your not afraid of snakes on a screen you're in for a really good time. There are moments of terror, laughs, and a spot or two of drama. You will find the reptiles attacking humans in ways never imagined and you even get the standard landing of a 747 by a most unlikely suspect.

Sure, the storyline is ridiculous, the action is over the top and ludicrous, and the dialogue frickin' sucks, but you are guaranteed to at least have fun, especially if you go with your friends. Snakes on a Plane is the ultimate B-movie, given that the film practically invites, no, *encourages* heckling and audience participation.

Shockingly enough, I went thru with the order, expecting the biggest stinker on the silver screen to appear (and yes, I was expecting it to be worse than any Uwe Boll film of ""Battlefield Earth""). I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this movie was indeed campy, trashy, downright-ridiculous, and quite an enjoyable experience. (With the right people. Take a group of friends, have a few brews, and enjoy).The plot: Read the title. Do I need to say more? The acting: Pure campy B-movie trash with Samuel L Jackson having a complete blast. Everybody else played their parts just as you would expect. Sci-Fi original movie acting, but on the big screen.The SFX: Utterly fake looking, yet with that fakeness comes the fun part of the movie. It's funny to see overly The Music: Probably one of the best soundtracks ever made. The music is trashy, yet completely fun. The music video at the end is most amusing.Overall: 7/10, mostly because for pride reasons I cannot rate a movie this trashy and bad over a 7.

265,Mxzplk,"Should have been a burst in the box-office, but turned out a fiasco. Reason: lack of imagination",5,9 September 2006,"Snakes on a Plane is the owner of an anthological phrase, and it ain't that one, suggested by many internet communities, which Samuel L. Jackson says he has had enough with the motherfu***ng snakes on the motherfu***ng plane. Having elaborated a plan to put on board around 400 vipers in an airplane to kill a witness on his way to a trial in L.A., the evil Asian mastermind of the movie is inquired by one of his minions: is this really a good plan? ""Well"", explodes the villain, ""you think i haven't tried already all other possibilities?"". It is very alleviating that the director David R. Ellis bothered in approaching the obvious incoming logical objections against the plot with this explanation for the presence of najas, chorales and sucuris in a commercial plane. But this preoccupation is also useless: this is a film built, from start to finish, around its title. Who is going to see it knows that the idea itself is ridiculous, and also knows what he is going to get: a story so weak that it hurts, but, at least on paper, full of opportunities for humor, mockery and even scare jumps - off course to the most generous average movie-goer, that doesn't bother with the badly done transitions from real serpents to the ones made of latex, the only kind that Jackson agreed to duel with.Strictly on these terms, Snakes on a Plane fulfills what promised. But, considering the frenzy that formed around the film during production, it is intriguing that David Ellis, from the much more efficient Cellular (2004), wasn't capable to advance one step further of what the people already expected from a movie like this. By the intense movement on the internet, it is common knowledge that it contained scenes such as of the couple attacked during sexual intercourse, of the guy bitten in a sensible area during a trip to the toilet, and of the fat lady that confuses the scratch of snake with another kind of affection. And, by the response at the box-office (a mere 32 millions in the US last time checked in the US), it is obvious that the public counted also on being surprised in some sort of way - and they weren't. Snakes can't do much aside crawling, biting and rolling, and there is a limit to the villainy that can be attributed to them. But to not know how to explore, specially in the post-September 11 era, the idea of a plane without a pilot, infested with irrational creatures and full of passengers in panic, it is the equivalent of earning a PhD for incompetence. Up on the hedge of embracing or rejecting the obvious meaning of the plot, the director and writers couldn't think of anything better then to include in their cast of killer snakes a serpent specially poisonous that came from the Middle East. It is probably because, as the villain of this movie, they believed to have tried all other possibilities, to end up resorting to the lack of originality.The animal game, of the meanings that cinema gives to the animals in movies, have others previous and better attempts of expression and substance to nature's best known inhabitants. In The Naked Jungle (1954), Charlton Heston has been living for so long in the jungle that is not sure anymore of what to do with a voluptuous woman such as Eleanor Parker. Not by chance, her arrival coincides with an attack of killer ants: there is no better symbol for the tingle - and panic - of Heston. As for The Birds (1963), this thriller Alfred Hitchcock made it during the nuclear escalation of the Cold War of a group of sparrows, gulls and crows which, with no explanation whatsoever, start to violently attack human beings. The monster of Alien 3 (1992) invaded the host and feeds off him until it takes the person entirely, ending up destroying him: the original film of Ridley Scot was made in 1979, before there was even a name for AIDs. But it seemed to synthecize the disease so well, that in his episode, taking place in a male prison, the director David Fincher openly expropriated the metaphor.On this passage, from most discussed production of the year to fiasco, Snakes on a Plane illustrates a common dilemma that entertainment faces in the age of interactivity. The news of the movie took the web in the way of a ""viral"" video - name to those jokes made by anonymous such as the ones found at YouTube, that spreads over the internet like a virus. The producers thought that the best idea would be to deliver the control of the project to the masses. You can see in what it ended up. The audience likes to play director - but complains when they realize that the actual person they are playing as doesn't even collaborate.",Snakes on a Plane

The title didn't lie, there's not much more to this movie other than a pane and a whole bunch of poisonous snakes on board. Of course there is also Samuel Jackson. I enjoyed it very much and felt that there was nothing there below what I expected, and there was even some parts that I thought clever. Point is, if you pick up this movie, and your IQ is above 15 then you should probably know what you are getting in to. And you get it - in Spades. I found it a really cool, fun way to enjoy a movie. It didn't require much thought, just reaction. I think we all need that kind of a movie here and there just like we all need some junk food from time to time. Can't wait for the sequel, 'Snakes on a Train' where I hear they'll have an Anaconda the length of three train cars!It wasn't quite Shawshank Redemption, but I am sure if Morgan Freeman was narrating over it, then it would have been close.",Snakes on a Plane

I was worried going into this film because I think the idea is sound and hype made it seem invincible. I was worried the film was going to end up being a below-average horror that only got attention through Samuel Jackson.However.,..this is not the case. I loved this film! From the very start this film is not an action film, it is not a horror film or a comedy. It's a weird mix of horror, thrills and comedic value...it's a film that doesn't take itself seriously but then again doesn't turn into a spoof or a comedy itself.Samuel L Jackson plays the lead amazingly and is amazingly cool as always, and of course he has the ultimate moment by saying the lines ""I AM TIRED OF THESE MOTHER F****** SNAKES ON THIS MOTHER F****** PLANE!""...pure brilliance.The film is not for the squeamish!....it has every sick and funny moment you can think of that involves snakes biting something (eyes, tits, penis's and tongues) and there is that feeling that ANYONE can die at any moment..even the slick Sam Jackson himself. Little kids get bitten, dogs get killed and babies are put in danger. There's quite a few jumpy moments in the film and suspense is kept high without ever taking over from the fun side of the film.Overall I enjoyed this film A lot and would recommend it to anyone looking to spend a couple of hours having a dam good time! Me and my friend went together and spent most of the time laughing because of everything was SO damn cool.The film is a blast...sure it won't win any Oscars or awards (except from the MTV awards perhaps..best film?)..so any die hard film buff who wants to find hidden meanings in films can look away now..this film was meant to be fun..and it is! 8/10",Snakes on a Plane

""Snakes on a Plane"" is Hollywood's first horror-comedy cop-thriller reptile flick and that spells ""misconceived."" With that title it's got to be an ""Airplane"" style sendup, right? Well, not exactly. The concept is wacky enough, and some of the characters are the kind you'd expect in that sort of a movie, but most of the humor is the gross-out kind without any wit behind it. And sometimes it plays like a comedy, sometimes like a third-rate action thriller. It can't make up its mind! Too brutal to be fun, too stupid to be serious. Like, how could anybody smuggle that many snakes onto a plane in the first place ? And why bother ? SoaP gets off to a pretty slow start, but the pace does pick up toward the end.

And when the two pilots are killed the only one who can land the plane is one of the members of the Three G's who flew planes in a video game. That part is a parody of Flying High in my point of view. The Negro is able to the land the plane and the survivors are relieved. This is the type of movie you don't take seriously.

BAD. Example, the air con is out and it's hard to breathe: Sam Jackson 'Let's get these guys some air!'A simple premise though, i saw a murder from a evil mob guy, lets testify, is surprisingly tense, as after the whole set up of bad characters who will survive, the snakes were unleashed. God help me, the graphics suck, but the sounds, i was feeling scared.Please note, i was looking forward to this for a long time, and had my hands over my ears and eyes a lot, but the beginnings of the snake invasion are excellent, two people doing it in a bathroom, a snake bites her nipple, horny, but funny. A guy goes to pee, the snake bites his person, he wrestles with it, pulling it a lot! i was in stitches.Then the plane's electrics fail, and our great friend, co-pilot David 'Whammy' Koecher begins to see snakes, after the pilot 'suffered a heart attack' from being bitten, and then the airbag thingys, never been on a plane so i don't know, fall down, along with snakes, and people's eyes are eaten, hilarious.A huge snakes goes through a woman's clothes whilst she's sleeping, and she moans, and that's the tone, silly, fast but ultimately fun.The two shocks for me came at the end, purely because one was random and the other was a long time since a last snake attack, but put it this way, when you hear Samuel L. Jackson say ""I'm getting pretty damn tired of these motherfu**ing snakes on my motherfu**ing plane!"" You cannot help but smile.Years of waiting has paid off to deliver a suspenseful, creepy, riot of a thriller, and in the end, isn't that what you want for a summer movie? this is now the second best film of the summer so far, first was Miami Vice.5 stars *****",Snakes on a Plane

The Academy ought to make some new categories for this fine piece of film-making, perhaps categories along the lines of ""Best Use of Snakes on a Plane."" Seriously, this movie is genius! GENIUS, I SAY!The premise is as follows. There's a plane, see? And, on this plane, there are snakes. And then, Samuel L. Jackson starts kicking a lot of snake-butt. On the plane. That has snakes. If this doesn't win for best original screenplay (or best picture for that matter), the Academy should be ashamed.Fine performances given by all. Everyone should win for AT LEAST one of the following: ""Best Actor in Leading Role,"" ""Best Actor in Supporting Role,"" ""Best Actress in a Leading Role,"" and ""Best Actress in a Supporting Role."" EVERYONE! I'm sure the Academy will fix the loophole only allowing one winner for each to accommodate this Godfather-quality movie.I think the snakes also deserve special mention. Man, were they intimidating and believable. Those snakes need to recognized by the Academy, too. Each and every one. Especially the python - I even recall him saying in an interview with Aintitcoolnews that he thought this would be the role that would get him recognized by Hollywood. I'm sure it will. It's unfortunate that he's thus far uncredited here on IMDb; I'll be sure to work on that immediately following this review.All in all, I would rate Snakes on a Plane, on a scale from 1 to 10, about 14...........million.SEE IT!",Snakes on a Plane

277,pal-o-lo,Phew! What a Ride! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !,8,10 November 2006,"I knew what I was going to, when i entered the cinema. This was going to be a movie with five minutes worth of mediocre script, more or less shallow dialog, uninspired acting, and ridiculously exaggerated Computer Animation sequences.In other words, a movie hopefully just barely worth the price of the ticket.I knew what I was going to, and yet I left the cinema with the feeling of having seen one of the most entertaining movies this year.Yes, the script would probably not entirely fill and A4 sheath of paper, and were filled beyond capacity with clichés. The acting was mediocre,(well except Samuel. You can give him a golden script, or total bullshit, and he always does the humanly most possible out of it.), and the computer animated snakes were so incredibly painfully fake. Okay, they looked real, kind of, but their behavior were so ridiculously ludicrous that I couldn't take them serious.Still those scaly m***'s managed to keep my heart racing for almost the entire movie. They always gave me a shock, even though I knew when and where they came. What made them work as well as they did, was some of the best timing I have ever seen. With no other comparison, if the Scream movies had just a fraction of this timing, they would have been a whole lot better than the complete utter rubbish and waste of tape they are.Those snakes made me jump time after time. Now I was sitting in my wheelchair instead of the seat, and it nearly cost me a bashed in scull. As that snake went straight for the camera, i came dangerously close to tipping backwards, and ending up with my feet in the air, LOL. One more thing that makes me give this one an 8 instead of a questionable 2, is the fact that it was blissfully free of the usual self-absorption we usually see in American movies nowadays. Instead the movie didn't for a second take itself seriously, and aimed for most possible entertainment. Thankfully it didn't try to be a seriously scary movie, which would have been a catastrophe.So therefore I give this one a solid 8, for its sheer entertainment value. I can promise you all, I left the theater with my face nearly splitting due to the grin that was plastered on it.If you haven't seen this movie, you should do it as soon as possible.Paladin Steelbreaker",Snakes on a Plane
278,redsoxmb545-1,Snakes on a Plane Delivers!,9,19 August 2006,"The internet buzz has been hyping this movie for ages and finally, Snakes on a Plane reaches the big screen. Samuel L. Jackson took a chance by immediately signing on to this movie after hearing the title, without even glancing at the script, and thank God he did, because without him, I'm not sure anyone would spend their money for a ticket to SoaP. The plot well, do I really have to tell you? I mean seriously, the title pretty much says it all. However there is a reason for them being there. An assassin wants to eliminate a witness (Nathan Phillips) who is traveling on the red eye flight from Hawaii to LA being escorted by FBI agent Nelville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson). The movie doesn't take itself too seriously. It's more funny than it is scary. The movie can't really decide whether or not it wants to be serious. Even so, I think the action and the humor blend very well. As you may have guessed from the blatant title, the movie is pretty corny. The acting isn't top notch (except for Jackson, of course), and the scrip has a plot hole or two (like how they managed to get the snakes through airport security). But it's quite obvious they weren't aiming for an Academy Award winning movie, but possibly a Teen Choice or MTV Movie Award winning movie because I think the teen audience will appreciate this movie the most. Snakes on a Plane is more entertaining than you can imagine. Watching the snakes slithering around and attacking people in various (and sometimes gruesome) ways and places is incredibly fun to watch. Snakes on a Plane was surprisingly better than I thought it would be, and I had very high expectations for it. I highly recommend seeing this movie. I am really glad that they decided to make it an R movie rather than PG-13. The snake gore and famous line from Samuel L. Jackson. ""I've had it with these motherf***ing snakes on this motherf***ing plane!"" was just majorly needed. After Jackson's classic line, the theater erupted with applause, shouting, and laughter. Someone actually stood up and gave a standing ovation. This is one of the reason why I would highly recommend seeing it in theaters with at least a few friends. It is much more fun to watch it in a room full of people. If you watch it at home by yourself, you may be a tiny bit disappointed. So definitely go see it on the big screen. Snakes on a Plane is fantastic popcorn, cheese ball fun. So sit back. Relax. And enjoy the fright!",Snakes on a Plane

280,laika-lives,"Samuel L. Jackson in ""Revenge of the Focus Group!""",4,20 August 2006,"This is not a film you can really analyse separately from it's production. The audience became the film-makers to an extent unprecedented in the history of the American film industry; we felt so involved that viewing it becomes like watching the work of a friend. How is it possible to be objective? This is our movie, isn't it? Or is it? There may be nothing more disingenuous than a film-maker who promotes himself as the audience's friend, giving them all the naughty treats that the nannyish critics would deny them. Just look at that prime self-publicist Eli Roth, promising gore-hounds all the viscera missing from literally gutless mainstream horror films, only to churn out a watered down and technically incompetent piece of work like 'Hostel'.David R. Ellis may not have spawned the monster that was the internet response to his film, but he was, quite understandably, quick to engage with it. He took the carnival-huckster school of film-making to a new level, getting the fans to build what they would eventually buy. So many have enthused over this interactive, democratic approach to film-making that they seem to have missed the point - that this is the most cynical form of film-as-marketing. Nothing is included that the film-makers know the fans won't buy, and any old suggestion that will get bums on seats is incorporated. The fact that the pitch became the title tells you all you need to know.Isn't this just the evolution of the focus group approach? Individual creativity, talent, craft, ideas, all are sacrificed before the inane chatter of the masses. It's a critical commonplace that focus groups and test screenings don't make for good movies - why should the preemptive intervention of internet enthusiasts be any different? Because we happen to be film fans? Well, thank god for us, because otherwise I might not have seen a topless woman get her nipple bitten by a snake.So, yes, I had fun at the movie - a midnight showing, fresh from the pub and with a bucket of ice-cream - but it actually had relatively little to do with the film, and quite a lot to do with the atmosphere. Like Christmas, everyone seemed determined that they would have fun, no matter what. There was laughter, but I don't know if it was with the film, or at the film. With a film as calculated as this one, is that even a meaningful distinction? There are some genuinely good aspects to the film. Samuel L. Jackson gives a well-judged performance, pure self-parody but with a real sense of pleasure. Rachel Blanchard and Lin Shaye are decent in limited roles, and there are one or two inspired moments - the fate of the lap dog is genuinely funny black comedy that the rest of the film fails to emulate.The stock characters are to be expected, but the total lack of suspense isn't. What's the point of a film that combines two great phobias if there's no creeping menace? There are several snake-jumps-out moments, but they're incredibly badly staged. Only the annoying British man gets a decent pulpy death scene - the other killings are oddly flat. The demise of the honeymoon couple, for instance, is shamefully botched. Most of the actors fail to make an impression; it's a shame that a charismatic actress like Julianna Margulies should seem so tired (when she tells two kids to close their eyes and pretend the turbulent flight is a roller-coaster, she could be talking to the audience - the film falls far short).There are worse movies, but there are many, many better; another reviewer on this site compared this film with 'Lake Placid', and it's as apt a contrast as any I can think of. That film worked so magnificently because the performances were excellent, the jokes were funny, the suspense sequences were scary, and it wasn't devised by committee. That the characters had a little depth and shading was an unexpected bonus. I don't need a post-pub midnight showing to have a good time with that film.This film will, in time, fade to become a mere footnote in film history. If it sets a precedent, however, I'm genuinely worried about what might be crossing our screens in a couple of years time. In all probability, nothing much will come of it. Perennial popcorn favourites - 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Alien', 'Halloween' and of course, 'Star Wars' - just aren't produced by group-think.In the mean time, I'll tell you what - I haven't half got a craving for some Ingmar Bergman.",Snakes on a Plane
281,jp_011205,Sssssoooo Good,10,1 February 2007,"The time: around noon it seems. The place: a deserted area under a bridge in Hawaii. Gangster Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson) and his band of thugs are carrying out a gruesome execution. Too bad Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) happened to be there crouching in nearby bushes watching the whole thing in disbelief. Now Kim wants him dead as well. Sean now must fly to Los Angelos with FBI agent Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) and testify against Kim in order to lock him up for good. Since the first rub out failed, Kim must now find another way to stop Sean from arriving in Los Angeles. So, what does he do? He has his thugs smuggle a crate filled with tons of poisonous snakes that's set to burst open only once the plane is halfway to Sean's destination. In order to make the snakes aggressive, the leis handed to passengers as they board the plane have been sprayed with pheromones. Now the snakes are slithering their way around the plane attacking anything and everything in their sight. Everyone on board's only chance for survival is to join together and fight for their lives.'Snakes On A Plane' ('SoaP') is without a doubt the most talked about film of the year. It all started last year when many bloggers from MySpace to YouTube began chattering about it. Yes, 'SoaP' was heard far and wide. I myself first found out about the movie whose title explains it all while coming across an article entitled, 'Samuel and Snakes'. I was oddly and instantly intrigued upon finishing it. (Despite finding out Samuel L. Jackson opted to do the film without even reading the script.) Months passed with more and more buzz generating. And by the looks of it, it didn't look as if it were going to stop anytime soon. 'SoaP' was given the title 'Best Worst Movie of the Year' by 'Wired' magazine in their January issue. New Line and TagWorld held a contest that gave artists a chance for their music to be heard in the film. And various spoof trailers were created by fans including ones with the titles, 'Teletubbies on a Plane' and 'Snakes on Claire Danes'. Within the past year 'SoaP' has been seen everywhere imaginable. You're probably wondering why I'm telling you all this since it has nothing to do with what I thought about the film though. Well I'll tell you why.'SoaP' isn't like other films. It's something completely different. Almost an entity if you will. The buzz and media are both a part of it's ingeniousness. It can't be judged simply by normal standards solely on things like acting and visuals. There's so much more to it. Over the past two days I've read and heard people say how horrible and downright awful 'SoaP' is. Its not either of those things. The fact is those people just don't get it. I even tried to break it down into the usual categories you'd normally judge a film on. But it conflicted with how well I actually liked the film. Yes, there's some bad dialogue in a couple of the early scenes. Yes, the snakes didn't always look real. And yes, at times the movie is far more comedic than horrifying. None of this matters though. I had so much fun watching 'SoaP' I didn't care.The bottom line is 'SoaP' has a greatness that's essentially inexplicable. But not everyone is going to see that. I think Michael Phillips, reviewer for the Chicago Tribune, proves to be a prime example of the ignorance being exhibited when he says in his review, ""I liked 'Anaconda' better"". All I'll say to that is he needs a new job. Possibly a janitor in some dank office building wasting his life mopping floors, mumbling inaudible things to himself. Nevertheless, I'm not suggesting you see 'Snakes on a Plane'. I'm telling you to go see those motherfucking snakes on that motherfucking plane!",Snakes on a Plane

Also, interspersed with them are a bunch of entirely legitimate and actually reasonably good bits of acting which makes it a bit difficult to know how to react to SOAP in its entirety.It's a bit of a mess.1 star for the dog being fed to the snakes, 2 stars for the dying cop's last ridiculous words, 1 star for the guy who lands the plane and 2 stars for the really humungous snake swallowing that dude whole, which was wondrous nonsense indeed...

283,captain_robert_april,A Review on a Website or How the Disaster Pic meets the MTV Generation,7,17 August 2006,"Snakes on a Plane is the height of truth in advertising. It is a hearkening back to those disaster pictures of yesteryear in a way that the new Poseidon should have been. You have a seemingly impossible situation that seems far fetched and odd, a group of people who would never be in the same place, and then they all band together so that some of them will make it out. Think about Towering Inferno or the original Poseidon Adventure... now add a bunch of modern mentalities and you have Snakes on a Plane. It is a popcorn enjoyment film that will undeniably exist in a few cult classic collections, and yes, I enjoyed it for what it was... a disaster flick trying to ratchet it up a few levels and bring in younger audiences. I saw a 10:00 preview showing at the local Cinemark on Thursday night, and I must admit that this movie did entertain the audience... there was laughter, some applause, and a few jumps. The movie did the job I wanted it to do. Its not the Cider House rules, and its not Pulp Fiction... but its good for those who want truth in advertising and a movie that provides what the title says. It follows its own logic, its own ideas, and its own idealism, but that is why we suspend belief for these movies. Overall, this is the new type of disaster film... the Towering Inferno, the Poseidon Adventure, and those countless Airport (insert year here) movies were our parents, and now we have a movie inspired by years of Mountain Dew marketing ad extreme-ism and hearkening back to those grand disaster films of yesteryear.

I think this film was excellent. The only things working against it were the clearly fake snakes, the cheesiness, and the really bad acting present at the early parts of the film. And I'm not one to ride the hype train (I passionately hate action blockbusters).If you can look past those faults, this is one of the best tension filled movies to ever take place on an airplane. There's just so much good in this film. Definitely enough to outweigh the bad. The pacing is great, the danger feels real, you get concerned about the characters, and Samuel Jackson just steals the show. My only serious problem with the movie is that I feel as if the beginning and end don't fit the quality of the middle. But then again, that's not a big problem. I can look past that to see a great movie. While not a masterpiece, this film is definitely the best something of its genre can be.",Snakes on a Plane

An intellectual piece exploring the notions of airborne terror and snake behaviour in captivity? The movie is called ""Snakes on a Plane"" for God sake - you should know just from reading that title that you're going into watch a cheesy, brain dead, completely over-the-top action movie, and on that score, it doesn't fail to deliver. Disengage your brain, sit back and watch as the quite frankly hilarious mayhem unfolds.From my personal perspective, everything about this movie works, from the paper thin ""plot"", through the (quite possibly intentionally) woeful CG snakes, to the ham acting delivered by the entire cast. Samuel L. Jackson's performance is never more than entertaining, and the rest of the cast back him up quite admirably - particularly Rachel Blanchard and Juliana Margulies - whoever thought the dour one from ER would take so well to kick ass action movies? I'd put this movie into the ""so bad it can't help being good"" category along with Anaconda, although it's much better than Anaconda because it doesn't have the monumentally talentless J.

Unfortunately, half way through the flight hundreds of poisonous snakes are released in the plane.

So if you are looking for a movie that has some silly humour in and you just want a good laugh then ""Snakes on a Plane"" is definitely the one for me.

Even though it was formulaic, I enjoyed it and thought about how one *could* knock off someone on a plane without tripping up security, and if you *were* on a plane with all these poisonous snakes, how *could* you survive. Have to say, I went because I'm such a big SJ fan, but the other cast members were quite good as well.",Snakes on a Plane
289,XFLRWF,"""Snakes"" does not want to shed B-movie skin",7,21 August 2006,"Samuel L. Jackson reportedly took on the starring role of ""Snakes on a Plane"" based solely on his liking of the movie's title. Audiences who watch the film with the same intentions will be pleasantly surprised by this heart-jumping thriller. Yes, it is a B-movie and follows the B-movie formula. But it performs with every intention of being one and makes no apologies. The cast and crew have fun with the material and the result is a successfully entertaining film.While riding his dirt bike through the back trails of Hawaii, surfer Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) witnesses the brutal murder of a prosecutor by crime boss Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson). Rescued by FBI agent Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson), Jones embarks to Los Angeles to testify against Kim. Kim discovers the flight Jones is on and loads the plane with hundreds of poisonous snakes in order to make sure the plane and passengers never reach their destination. In a frightening game of survival, agent Flynn must protect Jones and maintain order of the passengers before every one of them goes down in the ocean.One of director David R. Ellis' unique camera methods is to show the scenery from the snakes' perspective. Whenever the snakes are slithering through the plane, Ellis utilizes a night vision technique. The scare tactic works well in demonstrating that snakes can attack anywhere and the passengers cannot completely escape them. Ellis also makes use the fact that the creatures he's working with can lash out anywhere and employs quick cuts to further exhibit their ferocity in the grisly (and sometimes humorous) deaths scenes that befall the passengers.What is a B-movie without a B-movie script. Screenwriters John Heffernan and Scott Guttierrez utilize this opportunity to the full tilt. In the first place, their main villain, Eddie Kim, hardly has any screen time. He is only shown in the opening moments of the movie and then giving the order to load the snakes. The writers may as well have cut the fat and simply have talked about Eddie Kim and his heinous crimes. Some other characters that are given more screen time seemed to be written in order to add exemplary bravery or become just another victim for the snakes. The trait of convenience is also very apparent. Whenever a specific tool or some other requirement is needed, it just happens to be available in a flash. Other predictabilities occur as the script follows the classic B-movie formula: if you have sex, you die; the biggest jerk in the film dies, etc.Playing a tough guy with attitude is nothing new to Samuel L. Jackson. While Jackson still plays Flynn as a take-charge agent, the twist is that he is thrown into a situation that he has never encountered before. Jackson does well to show the dichotomy of the personalities. When faced with the crowd, Jackson sports the tough guy persona in order to relieve the passengers' fears. When he is by himself or with a confidant, his uncertainty is brought forth. Yet to successfully tackle the role of Neville Flynn, there is no better choice than Jackson. He knew what was required of the role in this particular film and plays it to the tilt. Supporting roles include Nathan Phillips as Sean Jones, Julianna Marguiles as flight attendant Claire Miller, and Rachel Blanchard as socialite Mercedes. As the lead flight attendant, Marguiles goes through several emotions and personas from having to deal with different types of passengers. She is comforting to the scared children, upset with uncooperative passengers, and tough as Flynn's right hand woman. Outside of Marguiles, the other actors don't have much to work with. They either help out in the situation or become scared and hysterical. Phillips and Blanchard go through the typical behavioral transformation. Whereas Phillips starts off as uncourageous and Blanchard is spoiled, they become heroic and caring by the film's end.With its blatant goofy title and intentions, ""Snakes on a Plane"" still manages to extract some genuine frights out of the audience. David Ellis' direction captures the snakes' attacks and the gruesome deaths that are the result. The cast does a credible job with the material presented. But for all its flaws, ""Snakes"" does the job of entertaining the audience. One way or another, you will laugh or be frightened.VERDICT: 7.5/10",Snakes on a Plane

However, if you want to go and see Samuel L. Jackson kick the holy sh*t out of snakes (on a plane) then this is the film for you. It's dumb B-movie summer fun, and it delivered it by the truckload. It knows it isn't serious (with that title, how could it be), and honestly, the whole time everyone involved is just having FUN with it. So go, sit back, have fun, and see some snakes (on a plane).The plot on this bad-boy is razor thin with a pathetic, throw-away villain. After witnessing a murder, Sean (Nathan Phillips) is taken into protective custody by the FBI and more specifically, Jackson's Neville Flynn. He has to be flown from Hawaii to LA to testify and blah, blah, blah. Who cares, right? No one, seriously, NO ONE. Our villain, Eddie Kim, is worthless. We get two minutes or so of screen time from him. He's not the villain; the SNAKES are the villains!!!!! The real fireworks start when we GET ON THAT PLANE. You all know what's going to happen, so they don't waste (much) time building up to it. Eventually the snakes (on the plane) are released. People are bitten in hilarious and very painful fashion. Samuel L. Jackson has to control the situation in that bad-ass way that only he can, and he disposes of the snakes in downright hilarious ways (which I won't spoil, you have to see it to believe it). Most of your characters are generally stereotypes and some of the acting is wooden. Most of the characters are very clichéd and stupid as well, and they don't do the most logical things in the situations they are presented. But that's not what you care about. THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT! What is important, is the fact, that there are SNAKES... ON A PLANE! It's cheesy, B-movie fun, and don't let anyone tell you any different. You want to see snakes on a plane, you're going to see snakes on a plane. Period. It also plays homage to some Jackson flicks of old, I'll let you decide which ones, since the scenes are obviously set up in that way. Try to think of other films Jackson has been in with reptiles.The special effects were PRETTY good; it was obvious when you were looking at a CGI snake or a real snake, that much I can tell you. But it didn't matter. It doesn't take you out of the movie at all. The action is as good as you can expect from people whooping snakes and vice-versa. It was a good thriller, they kept it moving and didn't slow down, and they kept the tension riding high throughout the film. And it's FUNNY. It's funny if you expect it to be cheesy fun, and it is, and I was constantly laughing throughout. Even as snakes (on a plane) are killing people, you're laughing at it. It was just that good.I don't know what else I can say about this, except that if you have the chance, SEE THIS FILM OPENING WEEKEND. Get a crowd in there that wants to have good, dumb, popcorn-movie fun and you will have a blast. My theater was off the hook, and it's seriously the most fun I've had at the movies in longer than I can remember. Go into this film knowing what it is and watch it with exactly that in mind and you'll have a GREAT time. Expect nothing from it and just let yourself have fun for a couple of hours. This film won't be the darling of the critics; it wasn't pre-screened because the makers KNOW what this film is and what they expect from it. I can't think of another instance where a film drew this kind of buzz on its title alone, and where everyone who went to see it completely knew it was going to be ""so bad it's good."" And it really is. Kudos to the studio that ordered re-shoots after all the buzz on the internet kicked in, it really shines. And thanks for the ""line"" which is quoted at the head of the review. Everyone in my theater said it with him, and EVERYONE was cheering.Snakes on a Plane has landed. And it's good summer fun. With snakes. On a plane. Eight out of ten stars.Sgt. Fluffy",Snakes on a Plane
293,spacetooner,snakes in my heart.,6,1 January 2007,"I would like to say that this movie really disappointed me. Sam L. Jackson as well. To tell the truth, this movie brings an idea that I have never experienced before in another movie. It brings the thought of horror just if you imagine yourself in a plane where many snakes had been ""implant"" inside it. But, it never brings it and stick it in your heart like many movies always did.Anyway, snakes on a plane's scenes are very boring. Despite the fact that it has a lot of actions. I was very patient because I want it to end, not because I hate it that much but coz I don't like to watch a movie then drop it off without continuing it till the end.Please, just don't spend money on it, but i worths downloading.",Snakes on a Plane

295,JoeJames76,As funny as the title suggests,8,23 August 2006,"So bad, it's good, seems to be the moniker for this film straight from the start. Terrifically bad, and knowingly so, this film plays the ludicrousness for laughs, winking the entire time. Using the Leslie Neilson approach, good actors playing it straight for comic effect, this film takes its amusing premise and runs with it.Right from the start, the film puts us in an 80s action setting; island locale, dirt biking intro, guy stumbles upon villain with evil henchmen in tow. The music tells us it's serious, but the lines of dialogue tell us otherwise. Then the ""money"" shots of snake carnage occur and the audience is howling along for the ride.Imagine an ""Airplane/Airport"" type of film paired with ""Anaconda"" and ""Python""! Thrill as Samuel L. Jackson delivers lines like, ""I want these motherf***ing snakes off this motherf***ing plane!"" with as much conviction as hit-man Jules from ""Pulp Fiction""! Delight in the technological wonder of the Snake Cam! You will be entertained! When you really think about it, combining the three common phobias of flying, snakes, and enclosed spaces, should make for a terrifying film. The genius is in how they take this preposterous scenario and play it for laughs, action, and melodrama. Director David R. Ellis, who took similar goofy material to guilty pleasure territory with ""Cellular"", guides this perfectly, when it could have easily gone off course. Jackson's conviction and commitment to this film (and the rest of the cast for that matter) make it an enjoyable bit of foolery. I only wish they had given the lead villain a real kick-ass martial arts scene to end the film. I can't wait for the sequel, ""Snakes on a Boat""! Grade: B",Snakes on a Plane
296,fatmaninatrenchcoat,Oh hells yeah!!!!!!!,7,18 August 2006,"I loved this movie!!!! First off, for the record, let me say that SoaP is Definitely a BAD movie. And it is not a horror movie. It is first, foremost and completely a comedy. Everything in the movie, from a snake biting off a nipple to Sam Jacksons brilliant solution to the Snake problem is designed to make you laugh. This movie is brilliant because it is so self aware, and it knows that its audience is aware that it is self aware before they even step into the theater. It is a genius marketing ploy, and it works to perfection. It is obviously designed to be seen by the fans who have been following it progress for the last few months. And let me tell you, the crowd I watched it with was definitely in on the joke. We even recited, in mass, Sammys I'm tired of these mother@#$@$@ snakes line as he said it. Great B movie, If you love pure, silly entertainment this is the film for you. If you are looking for an actually quality horror film, see the Descent instead.",Snakes on a Plane
297,limejockey,Great Popcorn Movie Fun,8,31 August 2006,"Firstly if you have problems with snakes there are a lot of shots of snakes leaping at the screen (befitting a movie called Snakes on a Plane) so don't say you haven't been warned. However outside of that this is a great popcorn movie elevated by the presence of Sam Jackson doing his cop with attitude thing which fits this story like a glove. Decent supporting turns by various actors from TV and other movies (Sunny Mabrey Juliana Marguilies Flex Alexander Kenan Thompson and Rachel Blanchard to name a few) add to the fun and keep things interesting for all concerned. Direction and script are serviceable without getting in the way of the fun, and the actors do seem to be having a lot of fun with the situation as it presents itself. All in all a fantastic way to fill a couple hours.",Snakes on a Plane
298,bradleyadita,Enough Is Enough,8,10 September 2006,"Snakes on a Plane is a film. Evidently some money was spent on it and some money was spent to see it. Tomorrow is the 5th anniversary of Sept. 11th 2001. I venture to say this film would not have been made if we were still living in the shadow of 9/11. However, here this airbourne terrorism is pushed to a ludicrous extreme. Snakes also brilliantly walks the tightrope between full on parody (i.e. the Scary Movie franchise) and authentic horror film (i.e. Silence of the Lambs). As if following the advice of Cheap Trick, ""surrendering but didn't give themselves away."" SoaP is also inextricably linked to internet culture and will be viewed in the future as an early example of the power of the internet to generate hype. While this film was uber-hyped before release, the post-debut banter has seen a sharp decline. My personal experience was seeing this film at the Cascade drive-in double feature with Talladega Nights. It was the perfect venue to see these films, seen with friends and out in the country with country folk in the cars nearby. I couldn't tell which film the audience liked more. There was a little ""audience participation"", but not the overbearing type which i heard about at some of the showings of SoaP. I'd recommend seeking out your local drive-ins and giving them some business. Snakes is a good thrill. It is kinda gross. It has it's blood-rushing moments. Maybe Public Enemy has a point, ""Don't Believe the Hype"", but in the case of Snakes on a Plane rather, believing can be fun.",Snakes on a Plane
299,happygoluckyduck,Snakes on a Plane speaks to a post 9/11 world.,10,18 August 2006,"Terrorism is the greatest threat mentioned and alluded to in the media today. We are constantly barr+aged by stories of conspiracies, orange alerts, and attempted threats. Perhaps these stories are to be heeded and we are right to be so concerned about the anonymous terrorists that may or may not endanger our lives. But if we may in this forum be honest, approximately 98% of us will never fall victim to terrorism, and neither will any of our friends and families. And yet, we still must pay the consequences, sacrificing our time in security lines, our money to fund programs that watch our every move, and we sacrifice the right to a common butter knife on an airplane. Isn't there more to fear out there than terrorism? Shouldn't we be thinking outside of the box? instead of restricting ourselves because of fear, shouldn't we become more self-adequate and confident? These are the questions Snakes on a Plane raises for every keen viewer.This is not just the silly farce so many people want to make it out to be. Snakes on a Plane serves as an intelligent and subtle condemnation of the airline industry. The message is simple: we are prepared for anything except that which we are not prepared for. Snakes on a Plane is a movie that is designed to challenge us with its graphic violence and course language, but even more so with its implications and how those implications affect us as travellers. Snakes on a Plane is the ultimate acknowledgement that we are not ready for everything, and no matter how many precautions the airline industries take, there is nothing we can do to fully prepare ourselves. If we surrender this one simple fact: that we are helpless, then and only then can we turn to our brothers from different mothers, and say 'i've had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane.' Then America will be free. Snakes on a Plane, you are our vision, we give you highest praise.",Snakes on a Plane

301,TwoThirdsMajority,Take A Renny Harlin film but replace his director's seat with Stanley Kubrick and you'll get....Snakes On A Plane,8,20 December 2006,"Let's take an airline disaster film featuring terrorists. Wait, let's replace 'terrorists' with 'snakes'. That's right! snakes. Wait, there's more! Let's add a clichéd group of characters from Soul Plane into the movie, and let's not hire Kurt Russell. Try someone who appears in Quentin Tarantino and Renny Harlin's films. Nah, not Steve Buscemi. What about Samuel L. Jackson? He doesn't need to read the script! And let's find a title. Pacific Airflight 121? Nah. What about: Snakes On A Plane! Now that's more like it.That's the whole premise behind Snakes On A Plane. A title that could make you go roundhouse kicking with Chuck Norris. And yes, i mean that.After witnessing the death of 'some guy'(I didn't pay attention to the beginning), Sean Jones must testify to the judge at Los Angeles against the Triad who killed the 'guy' led by Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson). He is escorted by two FBI agents,Neville Flynn(Sammy L. Jackson) and i don't know, 'some fat FBI guy who resembles Inspector Gordon's corrupt partner in Batman Begins without the goatee'. Onboard Pacific Air Flight 121 from Hawaii to Los Angeles, where Sean and the two FBI Agents are inside, the threat is still not over. An assassin releases 450 snakes on board the flight and attempt to kill everyone on board and crash the plane so that it won't reach it's destination. And that's when the Renny Harlin moment comes.So, the snakes are inside the plane. So what they do? They kill the humans on board of course! And what did Samuel l. Jackson do? He kills all the Mother f***ing snakes of course! What else do you expect? Titanic?Despite how cheesy the whole storyline, the whole movie was awesome! It makes bad directors like Uwe Boll thinking why can't he make his films looked like Snakes On A Plane. And the director is David R. Ellis, the man behind films like Final Destination 2 and Cellular. And that's why this film is perfect. His style matches this film.The characters? let's just say that they're all characters from Soul Plane and Airplane, only better. We have a redneck pilot(Played by Frat Pack auteur David Koechner), a hot stewardess(Played by Sunny Mabrey), A flight attendant who's retiring(Juliana Margulies), a Paris Hilton wannabe(played by Rachel Blanchard), a Kanye West-looking rapper(played by Flex Alexander), his bodyguard(Played by Kenan Thompson), and a Brit(Gerard Plunkett, i prefer Stephen Fry). And what they all do in the movie? The hold hands, join forces, protect themselves and kill snakes! What? you think that they'll fight each other and throw themselves out of the plane? That's madness.But is the movie Worth it? Yeah. There are quite a lot of action scenes in this film. One of my favorite is when Sam goes to the control room and does Ellen Ripley and kill some snakes. And that line, the line which says ""That's It! I've had It With Motherf***ing Snakes On THis Motherf***ing Plane!"". That's was the line that people keep watching this film.It also gained a cult popularity before and after the film's release. Before the film's release, they compare Snakes with Rocky Horror, but after film's release, it gained a Clockwork Orange popularity. THis film is worth film. At the beginning of the film, you'll see it as a Renny Harlin schlock fest, but at the end of the day, you'll see Kubrick's sitting chair directing every scene of Snakes On A Plane. And i warn you: DO NOT TAKE THIS MOVIE SERIOUSLY! So please turn off your brains, thank you. Rating: 3.5/5. The2nd best theater experience of 2006 after Casino Royale(And i mean it!)",Snakes on a Plane
302,RoadSideAssistance,Huh? What's all the fuss about?,3,25 June 2007,"Quite frankly I was SICK and tired of hearing, ""YOU HAVE to go see Snakes on a Plane!"" It's an amazing film and is truly awesome. So I was at Blockbuster a couple days ago and saw this on a previewed buy it tag for $10. I said what the hell and picked it up. I came home and started into things.The plot is simple enough. Some guy witnesses another guy being shot and the people who shot said dead guy witness (yawn) the guy witnessing the scene (lol.... wow). So now they are out to get him and Samuel L. rushes to the scene being the ultimate FBI bad-ass and protects this tool. So the goal is to get said tool out of Hawaii (convenient eh? - adds for some flashy photography) and back over to LA where he can be a witness in the trial.So they get on a plane, and hence the plot, snakes are loaded aboard. The Leigh that are given to all the passengers (a Hawaii thing I guess) are conveniently sprayed with a pheromone that will anger the snakes. Already I have plot-hole #1: If it's easy to smuggle snakes on a plane and spray all these Leigh with pheromones, wouldn't it just be easier to snipe the guy, or blow him up with a bomb on the plane? ""Well then we wouldn't have a movie!"" some ass will yell. Whatever. I'll go along with it because it sounds fun. (Nothing yet in my critique has given this movie a low score).So in the movie we have a blonde bimbo, a BIG BREASTED blonde bimbo (so there's a boob shot), a stoner, the baby and mom, the actor, and a couple kids. Everyone else you can assume dies including the big breasted blonde bimbo AFTER we see her boobs. So whatever. The first snake scene happens after a snake comes through the bathroom hole where the smoke alarm was taken off by our stoner and DD'd counterpart that are getting it on. #1: The cargo (where snakes are) and ventilation ducts to a plane are two ENTIRELY different areas, #2: Marijuana and cigarette smoke rarely set off a smoke alarm, #3: You can't TAKE off a smoke alarm in those planes, you'd have to rip out the whole vent. So that makes this whole death scene simply stupid.After this, snakes start pouring out everywhere and getting into everything. It's all CGI so it looks completely ridiculous. Some guy gets bit in the weiner (yawn), other guys get bit in the face numerous times and such nonsense. Some 4 year old kid gets bitten by a King Cobra and somehow lives for 2-3 more hours (yet a King Cobra can kill an elephant in 3 hours so go figure). Meanwhile the only baby in the film survives although you can really tell the actors were contemplating killing it off. Either way they don't.So eventually everyone on the plane gets pushed to the front where said hero Samuel L is along with his witness. They baracade the hallways to the coach area of the plane. Even though the snakes are in the vents, cargo, cockpit, and all over, first class is protected. Kind of sends a message about first class in general. Pay more and you'll be safe WOOHOO $$$$ for the airlines. So they are all chilling there trying to call some whacko snake guy (the only person I found enjoyable in the film) to get info. on the vaccines they'll need. The one ACCURATE part about this movie is how the snakes were from all over the world and that hospitals don't carry enough anti-venom and vaccines to help - woohoo +1.Anyway, both captains die from snakebites (autopilot was enabled so that's good) and the agreement is to have some guy who has 2000 hours (on a video game mind you) fly the plane. Now if this was Flight Simulator 2000 or one of Microsoft's highly real games I MIGHT be able to buy it, but we're talking a ACTION PSP game here. Go blow yourselves directors because this is the flat out stupidest thing I've ever seen. So right as they come into the cockpit snakes are all over. So then Samuel's line comes out, ""I've HAD it with this #*(#&(#&$(*# snakes on a &$*(@&$(@*& plane."" Okay wow... I paid $10 for that *proceeds to whack off*. So the big plan to get rid of them all? Shoot out a window and suck them all out. LMFAO. If you put a bullet through a window in the plane you'd have a QUICK suck of error for about 4-5 seconds and that'd be it. NOTHING would be sucked out of an entire broken window, which is impossible (not in this movie though...) since it's not glass.So at this point we've got: PSP pro landing a 747, snakes being sucked out of the plane (with humans nearly being so), a kid that has the immune system of God, CGI snakes, 1-2 good lines, snakes places they shouldn't be, and various fallacies about planes.Unlike Eight Legged Freaks (decent-good movie), this movie took itself somewhat seriously. It was hard to determine if it was trying to be a joke, funny, spoofy movie, or if it was actually trying to be serious. I got mixed signals from it which is why it sucked. At the end we kind of forget the whole point of the movie and never see a cool, suspenseful or sneaky ending. Everyone is safe, Samuel asks the flight attendent out, and that's it. The villain apparently is screwed now (but we never find out) and apparently everyone just gets the anti-venom.3/10 - what's all the fuss about?",Snakes on a Plane
303,AverxgeJoe,Ridiculous and unfunny,3,11 December 2014,"The film's title says it all. The film is about snakes on a plane. A guy witnesses a murder and he must be escorted from Hawaii to LA in order for him to testify. The mobster who is the murderer in question smuggles snakes to the plane they are flying in. Then all hell breaks loose.The story is dumb to say the least. There is many problems with it, including plot holes. The writing is bad as well. There are clichés and unfunny jokes. Some of the jokes were so dumb I burst out laughing for the stupidity, but most of the times I just shook my head in disbelief. There were one or two funny lines mostly due to the fact that is was Samuel L. Jackson who was the one delivering them, but that's about it.Directing wasn't that good either. I know this is nit picking but there were also some continuity errors that shouldn't have been there. The CGI of the snakes was pretty bad. The snakes didn't look real at all and it was very cheap looking.There is nothing really to say about the characters. There were many of them and you won't be bothered to care who they are or what will happen to them. Many of them are stereotypes of whatever they are representing.And finally. I was surprised to see that this is categorized as action and thriller. There were no elements of a thriller, no suspense, no excitement. The snakes that looked more like toy snakes than actual snakes made sure of that there was no excitement. This film should be categorized as action and comedy. And it's a bad comedy.",Snakes on a Plane
304,john_murdoch2002,Rocky Horror for a New Generation,7,18 August 2006,"Let me just say that my experience seeing Snakes on a Plane was at a midnight screening on Thursday. Already, I was excited to see the movie, if only for the cheese fest that inevitably followed such a memorable title. By the time the movie started, there were already chants in the theater of the memorable Samuel L. Jackson line: ""I've had it with these motherf***in' snakes on this motherf***in' plane!"" And that is exactly what followed with this movie was something I had not seen since The Rocky Horror Picture Show: this movie became an audience participation midnight show.And that is exactly how this movies plays. With the hokey acting from the supporting characters, the cornball script and the predictable storyline, the movie has already seemingly packaged itself in being tongue-in-cheek, which is actually a breath of fresh air from all of the overtly serious films that have come out of indie studios and the schlock that most modern blockbusters try to pass itself off as being something more (X-Men 3, Superman Returns, Kingdom of Heaven, etc.) Snakes plays out with a pacing like the movies we were always told were terrible, the horror movie sequels of the 1980s.To describe the plot is basic at best: a man witnesses a murder at the hands of a crime lord who is nearly impossible to convict. Enter Samuel L. Jackson, who is in charge of bringing the witness into Los Angeles where he would be safe (which is kind of ironic if one sarcastically thinks about it). The crime lord finds out and dispatches the only kind of assassin he can get on board the plane: snakes. He has the Hawaiian leis sprayed with pheromones so the snakes will react viciously towards all of the passengers. Chaos ensues. Sam is the only man who can land the motherf***in' plane with the motherf***in' snakes.The premise is very unique in the way that it allows the snakes to overtake the plane and wreak havoc on all of the passengers as well as the plane. As far as the horror factor goes, there are a few moments that will surprise you, but they are like snake attacks themselves: they're quick and jarring, but once it's complete, there isn't much more. But the ride itself is where the true fun is and that's where Snakes is truly in a class of it's own.With some colorful, if not, generic, supporting characters like the rap artist who hates germs and being touched, the stewardess who is experiencing her last flight before she becomes a lawyer, the young child who has to look out for his younger brother, all of these characters add a degree of playfulness to the movie, even if they're character's never fully develop.But let's face it, if you're spending you're hard-earned dollars to see Snakes on a Plane, you're not going in expecting to see The Constant Gardener or Finding Neverland. You're going to see some motherf***in' snakes on a motherf***in' plane, and believe me, you will. This movies has plenty of snakes and delivers them up in multitudes. How will this movie play outside of the fan base that has already clamored to see it? Only time will tell, but as far as I'm concerned, Snakes on a Plane is a very unique movie experience, one that's best had during a midnight screening with die hard fans who know what they're in for.",Snakes on a Plane
305,okky-1,Are you kidding me,1,7 January 2009,OK I have never seen this movie in its entirety but all I can say is that myself and a bunch of other movie goers saw the extended shorts while going to watch another movie and without exception as soon as the shorts were finished the whole cinema erupted in laughter. Not because the movie was intentionally funny but more due to it being so ludicrous.Hey so I could be wrong here but I very much doubt it.

307,saturnalia33,Sit back and enjoy the flight,8,21 August 2006,"Unless you have been living on a remote island for the last couple of months, you should probably have heard something about Snakes On A Plane.Originally called 'Venom', it was turned down by over 30 Hollywood studios in 1995 and it would take a decade later until it started garnering interest after a screenwriter, Josh Friedman, blogged about it after being asked to work on the script and Samuel L Jackson was on-board after only reading the title of the movie.""Sam Jackson's pretty sure he's doing a movie called SNAKES ON A PLANE. And if Sam Jackson thinks he's doing a movie called SNAKES ON A PLANE...you're doing a movie called SNAKES ON A PLANE."" We all know how the internet can turn a small thing into a phenomenon and even though the film wrapped up principal photography in September 2005, due to the overwhelming internet fan base, New Line Cinema incorporated feedback from bloggers and websites into the film. The studio ordered five days of additional re-shooting to raise the MPAA rating from a PG-13 to an R.So...is the film any good? Yes and No. No if you haven't been swept away by the wave of interest over the film, have not been waiting eagerly to see it for months and if you were expecting something like Executive Decision. If, however, you have been cruising websites for the latest news and information, have created your own t-shirt and know exactly what the film is about then you bet your sweet ass it's a great film. Let's read on shall we? The film begins when Sean Jones, a free-wheeling biker witnesses the brutal murder of a prosecutor by Eddie Kim, a famous gang land leader and becomes a target of the gang. His only way out is to testify against Eddie Kim which involves a flight from Malibu to Los Angeles which is where the real fun begins.A crate opens midway through the flight and dozens upon dozens of poisonous snakes make their way throughout the cabin killing numerous passengers along the way. The death scenes are hilarious and grotesque. The lines of dialogue are hilariously bad. The plot is hilarious and unbelievable. It has all the ingredients of an absolute stinker but the fact that it is pulled off in a rather over-the-top pseudo-serious manner just adds to fun. This is a film to drop all pretensions, sit back and enjoy the flight. After all, it's called Snakes On A Plane!",Snakes on a Plane
308,jediduck95,Expect the popcorn to come back up,6,18 August 2006,"First off, this is a movie you might want to avoid if you have a weak stomach. I felt sick watching it and i've seen some sick movies over the years. Some things that the movie delivers is quick scares, gore, some realistic effects of the snake bites (based on my little knowledge), the massive killings of the passengers, invasion of private parts, some of the movements of the snakes, and corn factor.Some of the not-so-great parts are the effects of the snakes. It looks like sci-fi original movie effects at times. The action you really see is different ways the snakes attack the passengers, which at some points are bizarre attacks in private areas which will make you cringe.Some people might be disappointed about the small use of sam jackson's character. But he does deliver the great line at the end of the movie which makes his whole whole participation in the movie worth the money.I expected nothing but corny fights and screams but the movie managed to convince that these actors are actually being attacked by snakes.The movie delivers cliché characters which makes the movie more fun because the audience can try to guess which character will die and how. For example: A rude, rich businessman. Will he die a horrible death? Maybe.The movie delivers over the top scares and gore. The effects have a good idea of how snakes move but some of the effects look a bit cheap. If you can handle the exorcist then you might be able to handle this movie. That's the only way I can prepare you for this.Overall, it was a disturbing and corny picture which it has been promising for the last six months, but it's still ""snakes on a plane"".",Snakes on a Plane
309,indyj1,Now I Know Why This Movie Tanked at the Box Office,1,26 August 2007,"Is it possible to rate a movie a 0 or less? The filmmakers couldn't understand why this film, which generated tons of internet excitement prior to its release, was one of the biggest bombs of last year. After watching the first 38 minutes on HBO, I can't believe they were the least bit surprised. (After the scene where a snake jumps into a screaming woman's mouth to latch onto her tongue, I just couldn't take any more.) The trailers with Samuel L.'s now world-famous quote about the snakes, had the only good parts, if there actually were any, in the film. Why Jackson or Marguilles would sully their names by appearing in this atrocity is beyond me. While most of the characters aren't to be taken too seriously, they are, regardless, written and acted so cheesily, the movie makes a 4th grade play look like Citizen Kane. And in today's cgi-driven Hollywood, how they managed to make the snakes look more cartoonish than Sci-Fi Network low budget monster flicks is equally puzzling. If it were possible, I'd rate this a great big goose-egg, as it is easily the worst attempt at a film I've seen in years.",Snakes on a Plane
310,Leafsman_69,Biggest Surprize of the Year,8,26 August 2006,"I didn't go into this movie expecting much. The key to the film's enjoyment is that you go in with this attitude by shutting your brain down for about 1.5 hours with a big tub of buttered pop-corn, overpriced pop and enjoy the product in front of you. I won't tell you the plot because the name of the movie says it all. Jackson at first looked stupid for taking his role and insisting on keeping the current name of the film during production; however now he looks like a pop-culture genius by succeeding in a movie that would have little shot for success 5 to 7 years ago. The effects are cheesy but still worth a good view and the characters are diverse with the direction being way above par. The film is a good blend of comedy and horror which is a rare combo these days. The cast made the impossible possible. Snakes on a Plane rocked!",Snakes on a Plane
311,wrenster,The best summer movie this year...by far,10,17 August 2006,"After months of anticipation and internet build-up, Snakes On A Plane has finally arrived, and I am glad to say that it has not disappointed. In fact, in my general opinion, it has to be the most entertaining piece of movie making in a very long while.Without giving too much away, and believe me, I could go on about the inventive way in which these creatures attack, the most surprising thing about SoaP is that it is extremely funny. Sure, it has moments of tension and some quite nasty, gory scenes, but this is a roller-coaster ride of genuine laughs. After the first few minutes in which the story is set up, in which a man witnesses a violent murder and becomes a target for a gang leader, and is put into protection by FBI agent Samuel L, the introduction of the characters on board South Pacific Flight 121 gives it the feel of an old Airport disaster movie. But once those snakes are released, director David Ellis and his team crank up the laughs and away you go.As for Sam, and the rest of the cast, you can tell that no one is taking this seriously, and that makes it even more enjoyable. David Koechner, Champ Kind from Anchorman, pops up as a leachy co-pilot, although I was expecting him to shout WHAMMY! But this is Sam's movie, and don't you forget it. Cool to the extreme (even if he does lose that coolness for a split second at one point) every line he utters is said with an air of cynicism. He knows how ridiculous the situation is, so there's only one way to gothe comedy way.So those who expected SoaP to flop like a 747 losing altitude, its time to eat your words. This is the film of the summer and a definite cult classic in years to come. So rush to see it. You will be pleasantly surprised.",Snakes on a Plane
312,silverrain-4,Shame The Snakes Didn't Get The Makers of this Hogwash!,1,28 August 2006,"*may contain spoilers* I watched SNAKES ON A PLANE (SoaP) as I'd read varied reviews about it. Boy, was I disillusioned. It never ceases to amaze me why Hollywood stereotypes not only the public, but its movies too. Is there no such thing as 'the general public' in the movies any longer? Why could the aircraft not simply have been populated with regular folks? The type that would actually be flying from Hawaii to Los Angeles. Why must there always be the buxom blonde bimbo? Why must there be ANOTHER blonde bimbo with a 38D chest, getting it off in the toilets? (and whose blouse magically turns from pink to blue!). Ohh, the 'Mile-High Club'. Right. That's a new one, ay? How many times has the ""famous-black-singer-with-accompanying-hoodlums"" ploy been overused? Boring! And, why, against all logic would snakes attack and bite the aircraft's wiring, supposedly knocking out the avionics? Snakes have fangs, not teeth. What are the odds that a fang would actually penetrate shielded aircraft wiring? Hello? Reality checks here, please. Doesn't make sense and destroys the film's credibility thenceforth.A mere five minutes into these silly snake attacks and a girl is bitten on her nipple (snake attached) and a man has his penis bitten (snake attached). What planet are movie-makers living on these days? And just how corny can this get? From this point on, I watched through bleary eyes as the film trundled along, with me waiting for the next ludicrous snake antic. Samuel L. Jackson is Samuel L. Jackson; his acting is the same whatever role he plays. The idea is a good one, i.e. poisonous snakes loose on a commercial airliner (meaning there is no escape or running away), but, anyone who has the slightest knowledge of snakes knows they do not suddenly go on rampages, looking to bite and devour humans as soon as they are let loose. Pheromones or otherwise. They hide as much as they can avoid human contact, because as is humans' wont, they kill anything they don't understand.The plot of 'witness-being-shipped-to-a-hearing-to-testify' is as old as dirt (as if an FBI agent would accompany him). The captain then gets bitten on his neck as he is supposedly ""resetting the breakers"". Huh? Whenever was someone bitten on the neck by a snake, lurking in the shadows? There is even a ridiculous scene where a passenger opens a barf bag, only to be bitten on the tongue by a snake in the bag (incidentally, all these snakes 'attach' themselves to their victims, whereas in the real world, only 2 or 3 can actually do so of the thousands of snake species). When was the word ""dickwad"" incorporated into the Hollywood 'Book of Movie Adjectives'? It seems every movie now has this stupid word multiple times. Why did the plane have to be a 'red eye' in a storm? Why not daytime and clear blue skies? It's all so stereotypical and repetitive.There are a lot of movie-goers who read and write reviews here. I'm betting, given half a chance, a great deal of them could write better movie scripts than 85% of box-office releases! Why? Because we KNOW what is expected of movie audiences. We know what's corny and cheesy and what doesn't fly. How come Hollywood and Indie producers don't know this? They live in a different world, clearly. And they don't read or learn from their reviews! Why on earth would all of these snakes magically appear in place of the drop-down oxygen masks? It's childish. Of course, there's a scene where someone puts a snake in the microwave, just for the SPLAT effect. But the snake squealing? This may come as a surprise, but snakes do not actually squeal! The singer/star's hoodlum gets bitten on his ass. Wow! Hilarious, right? So now snakes have now bitten tits, penises and asses. What else could there possibly be? Jackson (suddenly part-time rocket scientist) then decides to announce that they need to build a barrier between them and the snakes. Incredible foresight, buddy. Whodathunkit? Even the ancient ""sucking-out-the-poison: gag is in here. I couldn't believe it!To add insult to injury, another scene shows a 20-foot anaconda that crushes a man and then attempts to devour him, head first. The scene shows the victim's head apparently expanding due to increased blood pressure. Anacondas are constrictors. They constrict. They do not crush. They also do not suddenly eat humans amidst the confusion on the aircraft. Such bad movie-making, really. A bit of research into herpetology by the makers would have been useful, instead of the sucking silly ideas out of their well-bitten asses! SNAKES ON A PLANE is just 90 minutes of silly, inane and boring scenes of snakes biting people on an airplane. That's it. That's what it is. If you're a brainless moron, you'll enjoy it. If you have an IQ above room temperature, you'll probably switch it off after 30 minutes. I struggled through this nonsense just to write a review, though I wish I hadn't. The final straw comes when the hoodlum, whose only flight experience comes from a Playstation 2 flight simulator game, lands the stricken 747 perfectly, and coasts to a standstill, right outside the terminal! Seems like SoaP is the sort of swill we're looking forward to in the future. Is it just me, or is 2006 a really bad year for movies? Has there actually been a decent film released this year? I think ""Ask the Ashes"" was the last halfway decent thing I saw. Woody Allen's 'Match Point' was also notable. There is nothing but immature, infantile garbage hitting the streets, churned out by inexperienced directors and producers. I'm not sure what genre this SoaP movie falls under, but a new one called 'stoopid' needs to be created. This is just NOT entertainment; it's movie-making at its worst.",Snakes on a Plane

It's one of those films that you are pleased you've watched because it's so much fun and it knows it (as if we were in any doubt, given the title). It's an hour and a half well spent. It's one of the best offerings of its genre.Having said that, it's pretty formulaic; you can see things coming a mile off, and the only memorable performance is that of Samuel L. Jackson, but that's to be expected, seeing as he is just about the coolest man on the planet. It just shows what an outstanding actor he is. He's able to do the heavy stuff just as well as this type of movie.The script is witty and fun all the way through, unlike others, which can lose interest in funny dialogue in favour of action sequences.This movie, then, is predictable, but well executed and funny.

If you liked it and I am stepping on your toes, I'm sorry and please don't read the rest of this review because it might hurt your feelings. The snakes were either over done computer generated ""super snakes"" that did not look the least bit real; or they were ""Dollar Store"" rubber snakes that people dangled out of their mouths, off their pecker or nose and swung around to give them movement. If you're over the age of 12 and your IQ is over 70 this would not be a good pick. If you buy into this movie or if you find the method used to rid the plane of snakes plausible, then you should buy this one when it comes out on DVD and watch it about 100 times, you are easily entertained.

It was half black, half young, half old, half white, half-baked, and entirely ready to thrill to the sight of deadly snakes biting every vulnerable body part while Samuel L. Jackson dispatched numerous snakes with varying degrees of awesome badazzness, while ripping off quotable one-liners. It was a real unifying experience. We were ALL on that airplane, cheering for Jackson to figure a way to get the passengers to put aside their petty differences and various neurotic tics, and bring the survivors down safely, while killing as many mf'ing snakes as possible in myriad awesome ways.Also, the opening and closing songs on the soundtrack were excellent. Stay through the credits and watch the music video. It's hilarious, especially when the guy in x-ray isn't noticing that their luggage is filled with snakes.

The movie is basically spectacle, in other words ridiculous blood-gushing, eye-foaming, fist-clenching gore, which is the ""star of the show."" The plot is merley a ridiculous transmitting device to provide a reason for all of the blood lust that takes place on the plane.

But it did remind me of the 70's disaster films with the overacting, but I like this as it fit the plot. Unrealistic plot requires unrealistic acting, otherwise the movie would be out of balance.

320,Stenian,"Has some fun moments, but it's cheesy, over the top and confused as its genre goes",5,18 November 2020,"Snakes on a Plane doesn't know whether it's a comedy, an action or a horror film. I haven't seen a movie this confused since Ghost (1990). Maybe if it were more comedic or more serious, I would've liked it better. The genre fuse didn't work for me.Also, it seemed like they tried so hard to make the film bloodier in order for it to attain the R-rating. And I was right by thinking that because they did reshoot some scenes to make them gorier. Conversely, the gory scenes were actually unrealistic and made the film worse. Snakes don't slash you and gut you. So instead, they had characters stepping on each other's heads with stilettos to provide us the gore. That's just as bad as watering down an R-rated film so it can get a PG-13 film. These were all unnecessary reshoots and/or edits. So I don't see how the film would've failed as with a PG-13 rating.And what was it with the snakes biting dicks and slithering inside people's genitals? Was that supposed to funny? Again, if this were a bona fide comedy film, maybe I would've laughed. Some scenes were too dark and serious, and the comedy just seemed inappropriate. The sex scene in the plane's restroom was probably the most irrelevant and pointless scene in movie history. Again, forcibly included so the film would receive an R-rating (oh and let them smoke marijuana whilst at it!). Really pathetic.Some scenes were nicely suspenseful of course. Samuel L Jackson, Julianna Margulies and the Aussie actor Nathan Phillips were pretty good, and made the film watchable. I also enjoyed the 'gay' flight attendant, who didn't turn out to be gay at all. That was a good stereotype to break. Kudos to the writer. Eddie Kim was a good villain and it's too bad he wasn't really shown much. His character is screaming for a sequel or some spinoff - If they ever make one!",Snakes on a Plane
321,Super_Fu_Manchu,It's fun - but don't believe the hype.,6,23 August 2006,"I evaded much of the hype, but dutifully went to see the movie. Throwing in my two cents is a little superfluous now, since everyone will already have their own ideas about the movie (and many have invested way too much in it to succumb to reality at this late stage) but the movie was no great shakes. Everything previous to the arrival of the motherf*cking was motherfu*king boring - and whilst we expect characters in a film such as this to be one-dimensional, do we really need to spend so much time in their company, listening to jaw-droppingly mundane dialogue not too far divorced from TV soap opera chat? Once the snakes arrive things thankfully heat up a little, and the first massacre scene was gratifyingly OTT. However, the snakes are really pretty boring and unconvincing (I've seen better CGI in a video game). They're never as menacing as the REAL snake they used in 'Venom'... I firmly think animatronics and real snakes should have been used like they did back in the day.One can't help but feel Sam Jackson was cool but not exactly riveting or as entertaining as we might have hoped. He retains all the magnetism and charisma we expect of him, but the script never allows him to cut loose enough, and while he's right to play the role straight, he ends up just being quite unremarkable.There are a few chuckles to be had and it's not a bad way to spend an evening (but a terrible way to spend months reading blogs and designing posters). The main thing I object to is that modern teen audiences seem to be reacting as though they've never heard of 'exploitation' films before. I hope anyone who enjoyed the 'Snakes on a Plane' experience will check out some of the older (better) exploitation flicks, from kung fu, to blaxploitation, to monster movies to horror.

No, it is Snakes on a Plane, all the way down. It's monkeys winging their way through the firmament while struggling with the ancient enemy. Yup. What's in the title is in the movie. Nothing more.

No, what it is, is pure entertainment. But it's well written, well directed, and surprisingly well acted entertainment.Lets start with the writing. Okay, so we aren't going to get deep characters, but the thing is, we are given enough to make us root for the characters... well, most of them. The dialog is good, not overly talky, and the pace is well done. Whoever wrote this script should get a pat on the back. They had the chance to totally phone in a cheap, crappy action script, and instead made something that was funny, fast, exciting, and oddly enough, likable. The characters aren't deep, but you like a good chunk of them. Even small characters are given bits that make you root for them, especially the flight attendants, and a select few of the passengers.The directing is tight. Things look good, they work, and the pace is kept up. Even during slow moments, exciting stuff is going on around them. This should be no surprise considering that this shares the same director as Final Destination 2. So, another plus there.And the biggest plus... the acting. Not one of the actors phones in their performance. Everyone goes all out, especially Samuel L. Jackson, Juliana Margolies (sp?), Sunny Mabre, and in a smaller part is the amazingly talented Lynn Shaye. The entire cast does what they have to do, does it well, and does it with more conviction than a movie named Snakes on a Plane deserves.So... is Snakes on a Plane a good movie? Actually, it is!

Would I have loved it as much watching it alone on DVD? Probably not. The theatre experience is what made the movie so great: hooting and hollering as SLJ kills snakes left, right and center; hissing at the screen in anticipation of snakes to come... It was just a blast.Some of the acting is so bad that it's great (the Asian guy playing the crime lord had the theatre in hysterics), but there are some pitch-perfect performances to be found here: Jackson (obviously) does his thing and will likely be remembered forever for this role; David Koechner has some great lines, just having fun with the smarmy pilot persona. Best of all is Todd Louiso as a ""snake expert"" on the ground, doing his best to guide Sam up in the air. Like the movie itself, he takes himself seriously to a point, but lets loose on lines like ""Time is tissue!"" and ""There's only one man who could amass a collection of illegal snakes like this. He lives...in the desert.""The effects are mostly pretty obvious, but it doesn't effect the movie at all -- some of the attacks really are shocking and scary; many of the death scenes are unforgettable, either because they're incredibly hilarious, or nauseatingly horrific. When the movie earns its R-rating it's at its best: the inevitable sequel will likely be even better, as they'll be shooting for R all along.Even if you think it will be stupid, I urge you to see this movie. I expected it to be either a wretched turd or an all-time classic, and was blown away. Flat-out, the movie delivers.

326,Skycoaster,A Pizza with no Toppings: Just Plane Cheese.,7,18 August 2006,"Perhaps the highly anticipated horror-comedy ""Snakes on a Plane"" should have been titled ""Snakes that Bite in Weird Places."" I know nothing of the venom-pumping preferences of any species of reptile, but I am quite sure that most snakes would not go to the trouble of biting an eye. Or a nipple. Or a... but I have given away too much already.From the simplicity of the title, there are no delusions about this film; there are snakes, and they are on a plane. There is no underlying symbolism or recurring metaphors or aesthetic inspiration, because we never wanted that. We wanted to be put in a ridiculous yet plausible situation and fight our way out with Samuel L. Jackson as our guide, with what is sure to be one of the most memorable lines of his career. The insultingly simple nature of the film broadens somewhat with a few specifications: Surfer Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) witnesses crime boss Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson) commit a murder in Hawaii and entrusts himself to FBI agent Nelville Flynn (Jackson) for protection. Transporting Jones to Los Angeles to testify proves difficult when Pacific Air Flight 121 (A working title for the film) is infested with exotic, poisonous snakes that Kim rigged to be unleashed in the middle of the flight. In a weird way, the explanations for the more bizarre story elements seem to work, such as how a cat's hiss could be confused with a snake's rattle. But since the film never asks us to take it seriously, we have no trouble suspending disbelief.The comedy element of the film is in full effect, but suspense and jolts are common as well. We tremble when we do not know if the snake will strike, jump when the snake does strike, and laugh at where the snake struck. In some cases, the process continues when we cringe at the ugly after-effects of the venom, owing mainly to the convincing make-up effects used for pus and blood that coats the severely swollen bites. It is so gruesome, so exaggerated, and so gratuitous that it is hilarious.Those characters of the mammalian persuasion are captivating as well. Since Jackson signed on after reading only the title, we can feel his eagerness to stun us with his presence. The concept alone was enough to spring him into action, and his performance in the actual movie is even more perfect. The crew and passengers of the plane are mainly unknowns, although the minor role of Rick the co-pilot is played by the familiar face of David Koechner, but one performance that stands out more than others is Kenan Thompson as Troy, a bodyguard to a self-absorbed rapper. Since the generation that grew up with Kenan on ""All That"" and ""Kenan and Kel"" is old enough to see him in Saturday Night Live and R-rated movies now, this casting decision was a bull's-eye. In one scene, Kenan has to act toe-to-toe with Jackson, and I am glad to say that he holds up. Hearing him swear was odd at first, but then he began to sound like Jackson himself, a sure sign of good things to come.Aside from one homage to ""Aliens"" where Jackson arms himself with an improvised flamethrower, ""Snakes on a Plane"" is its own movie and an exercise in absurd originality. It acknowledges how creepy the actual situation would be and then dismisses care and concern with a laugh. Creature flicks come and go, but none of them will ever have snakes on a plane quite like Snakes on a Plane.",Snakes on a Plane

The 747 interior is completely nonsense, the cockpit is much smaller and there is no 'basement' under the cockpit, because it is on the second floor and there are passengers under the cockpit. There are triple backup systems on a plane and I doubt that a single snake can destroy the avionics and cause some 'flashy' shortcuts. I mean this movie is this unbelievable, that it really sucks - how can a snake go from cargo bay (this is down) through some vents on top of the passenger area? YET, the interaction between the actors is really good and Samuel L. Jackson does IMO a very good and believable job. However, all these snake killings are just dumb and not realistic for me and add nothing to the 'possible' drama depicted. The CGI is much worse than e.g. in Lost. Not my choice of movie, somehow gore, somehow funny but completely unbelievable for me. More than 5 is a heavy misinterpretation of the movie IMO.

328,Rick_Bman,"Not a great film, but a damn fun one.",8,2 December 2006,"Well, was this a brilliant masterpiece of film-making? No way. Was it the single most fun I have ever had at a movie theatre? Definitely; if you don't count that time in high school when I went and saw Volcano on a date, but that had nothing to do with the movie.The movie obviously has a lame set up, and the acting in the beginning of the movie is extremely bad. The guy that played Eddie Kim was just terrible. The beginning of the movie had some many obvious, glaring plot holes. After the first 10 minutes I was thinking I may have been suckered into see just another bad movie. But the movie grabbed a hold of me the moment that first snake grabs a hold of that woman's nipple and it didn't let go until Samuel L. Jackson was sliding off that plane and hooking up with the stewardess. At this point the acting or plot holes didn't matter, because I was just having the time of my life.As soon as the guy went to the bathroom, and started unzipping his pants, I knew what was coming. Everyone in the theatre knew it too, I heard people from every corner just saying ""don't do it man, oh no don't do it."" Sure enough, he did it and everyone in the theatre just burst out laughing. They were laughing even harder than when the woman got bit on the nipple.How about a non snake related highlight. The kid landing the plane was priceless. As soon as he said that he had over 2000 hours of flight experience I leaned over to my friend and said ""probably on Microsoft Flight Simulator."" But you know, the fact that I saw it coming didn't make it any less hilarious. The whole conversation he had with the air traffic controller about his flight experience, and then Samuel L. Jackson telling the air traffic controller that this kid IS the most experienced person on the plane was just so funny.Oh and when Samuel L. Jackson went to get the power back on, was anyone else thinking, ""Hey that is how he died in Jurassic Park."" Or when he was talking about building a barrier to protect them from the snakes did anyone else get a flash of the scene in Deep Blue See where his character is killed. I don't know if those moments were there on purpose, but they definitely popped into my head.Anyway, this movie definitely succeeded in entertaining me, and I will purchasing the DVD when it comes out.",Snakes on a Plane

330,killerreviewscom,Probably the most fun you'll have in a theater this summer.,9,19 August 2006,"Not since the days of the Blair Witch has a film circulated the internet and generated an amount of buzz that would put any well thought out marketing campaign to shame. Honest to God, the night before going into this picture I was dreaming about snakes: snakes on Myspace.com, snakes on Movies.com, snakes on Attack of the Show, the big snake in my pants, snakes freaking everywhere. True story - while waiting in line at the theater I overheard someone saying that they hadn't even heard of the film. Out of sheer bewilderment I turned to see a young woman with no eyeballs or ears. Oh, OK. That makes sense now. Joking aside, I was rather worried going in to this one because of all the hype. I mean could SNAKES seriously be that good? You bet your ass it can. SNAKES ON A PLANE delivers, delivers and then delivers some more.This slithery flick, starring Samuel (one of the coolest actors of our time) Jackson is about um snakes on a plane. See, a young man by the name of Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) witnessed a horrific murder and agrees to testify against the notorious Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson). However, Mr. Kim has plans of his own. The surly criminal pulls a few strings and it's these strings that manage to fill the two story aircraft with poisonous snakes. Snakes that are so jacked up on pheromones that they'll attack a chair if it's in their way. Now Samuel, his key witness, a couple of sexy stewardesses and a plethora of passengers must try to survive the remaining four hours of the flight.OK, so before we get into the movie I just want to give props to Director Davis E. Ellis and the people at New Line Cinema. The buzz started early with this picture, mostly due to the quirky title I imagine, because of this they went back and jacked up the nudity and gore in the film. They actually went and shot more footage to achieve an R rating. Sweet! Now if you don't know, eighty percent (guessing on that one) of studios pull out sequences to avoid receiving an R rating. Why, because of the money train baby. What Ellis and others did is a rarity in Hollywood. I mean ultimately it makes them more money because the film will live longer then opening weekend, but not many studios realize or maybe agree with that theory. So thanks guys! Thanks for caring about the films core audience as much as you did, or do. You rock! Where SNAKES ON A PLANE truly shines is when the snakes get loose on the plane, big surprise right? We spend about twenty minutes setting up the plot and dilly-dallying with the supporting cast, but once that's over and the snakes get loose it's freaking great. The first victim is a big breasted blond that goes down after receiving a fatal bite directly to her exposed nipple. Nice! Shortly after the snakes are everywhere and it's total chaos. The plane is losing control, people are running around screaming, snakes are swarming the floors and falling from the ceiling, luggage is bouncing everywhere while the lights are flickering on and off. It's complete chaos.The sequence is rather long too, but in a good way. It's obvious that the writers/director took their time coming up with cool bits. I don't think twenty seconds went by where I wasn't either: laughing, squirming in my seat or simply saying ""wow! That was really cool."" Once that sequence commences it's only a matter of time until the next one. The film is really balls to the walls from beginning to end.Elements like casting, music, directing and cinematography all work well, but I think everything boils down to the tone of the film. SNAKES ON A PLANE is a really fun movie, a smashing good time if you will.. I can't say that enough. We have hundreds of poisonous snakes infesting a plane, really cool snake bite effects - like swollen arms and puss filled faces, Samuel L. Jackson spitting out totally awesome one liners, a huge airplane that's about to go down at any minute and to top it all off, a big set of luscious naked tits. Yummy! Overall, out of all the films I've seen during this blockbuster season SNAKES ON A PLANE has to be one of the most satisfying flicks of them all. It's the most fun I've had with a horror movie in years. So yeah, I highly recommend this movie to everyone, even those with no eyeballs or ears. SNAKES ON A PLANE is must see entertainment.",Snakes on a Plane

I usually trust actual reviews from actual people but in this case the masses are wrong. It was not entertaining, it was not fun and it was not creative. Samuel Jackson and some gratuitous nudity couldn't even save this film. The plot goes nowhere and the writing is terrible. I thought at least Samuel L. Jackson would have some catchy dialogue but he didn't have that. This movie would have been right at home as a scifi channel movie of the week.

The plot was completely stupid and implausible: there was actually a part in this movie where the snakes deliberately cut the power on the air plane.All of the idiotic impossible things in this movie actually made it more fun to watch. Seeing Sam Jackson swearing at these computer generated snakes and then blowing them away was hilarious. There was also a very nearly X-Rated sex seen with a very well endowed young woman. I imagine many will buy the DVD just for that seen alone. I'm just wondering how they are going to make a sequel and what if would be called. Snakes on Plane 2: The Revenge of the Cobra?

334,madmax_thegamer,"Ummm stewardess, I think we have a problem.",6,27 August 2006,"Some people don't like snakes, others don't much care for flying, put the two together and you have a person who doesn't like snakes while flying, and who wouldn't fit into that category? Snakes on a Plane, the title of the movie itself explains the plight of our heroes, who are trapped on a plane flying from Hawaii to Los Angeles that just happens to be swarming with poisonous snakes. While it might not be the best movie to ever grace the silver screen, Snakes on a Plane can be a fun way to spend an hour and a half if you have a couple of friends with you, especially one who doesn't like snakes because you can play all kinds of mean trick on them.We meet our heroes in the opening minutes of the film; Sam Jackson plays an FBI agent charged with getting a murder witness back to L.A. to testify at a trial. He and his charge board the plane along with a host of other characters such as the nervous flyer, the sexy dumb blonde girl, the jerk you love to hate, and many more. Shortly after take off a crate of poisonous snakes are let loose on the unsuspecting travelers and mayhem ensues. Many unnamed minor characters are dispatched in rather gruesome and pain full fashions, while others survive and attempt to escape to some type of save haven. While many parts of this movie come off as silly, stupid, gross, or unnecessary, it does have some entertaining aspects as well. Sam Jackson plays his character well with his typical bravado, and the other actors you might recognize bring enjoyable performances as well. The snakes, some digital, some real also deliver in their performances. (Didn't I see that one in python? Good to see him acting again!) There are also many wonderful camera shots, from such locations as outside the plane, on the island, and in the cargo hold of the plane itself. Finally this movie has some funny scenes, some made you jump scenes, and some gross out scenes as well, and also brings a few memorable one-liners to the table. While it might not be worth a full price admission, grab a few friends and go the matinée or rent it when it comes out on DVD.",Snakes on a Plane
335,jpatrick1967,Freedom of Speech???? Report me again.,1,30 August 2006,"There has not been one original idea to come out of Hollywood and been worth something in so long. Being that this movie is intended to try and entertain, it is very difficult to pick it apart piece by piece. But the fact that they put this out to a mass audience and it sucked, opens itself up to ridicule.Without going into any specific problems with this piece a garbage, I just want to point out two very general problems I have with movies of this type: 1) Movies where nature is the antagonist. SNAKES FEAR PEOPLE!!!! Most animals in the world fear humans, but snakes go out of their way to avoid things that are much bigger than them despite what Hollywood tells you, (see Anaconda). If snakes were released in an atmosphere like the plane, they would do everything they could to hide in a dark area until they could find a way out. Why do film makers insist on making animals anything more than instinctual creatures who's only goal in life is to survive by eating and reproducing? Please stop making movies where animals get ""smart"" all of a sudden and have ""agendas"". These movies suck. Ironically, Jaws is my favorite movie, but that was the first, best, and should have been last movie where the animal looked to be acting on more than just instinct.2) Movies where airline pilots get killed or incapacitated while still in flight. Inevitably, in every airplane disaster film, there will always be someone in the cabin who can take over the complex controls of a huge airliner whenever the pilot, co-pilot, navigator, etc. get knocked out. Is there anyone in the movie business who realizes that learning to fly and land a plane is not a weekend camping trip? And that video games are not training grounds for flying plane, or fighting wars, or killing zombies, or putting dresses on Barbies. Stop making movies where the plane landing depends on some jerk who at first is apprehensive because they have never ""flown a plane before"" and then all of a sudden becomes an expert. Come up with something original. Let the plane go down already. End an airplane film the proper way when all other flying experts have perished: let the plane come down to the ground at 600 miles per hour. Then we will see something original.Stop making this garbage please!!!",Snakes on a Plane

This is not the sort of movie I would recommend if one is after a thrilling cinematic experience, or intellectual entertainment, but if you're after a good relaxing movie that makes you laugh in places (sometimes where you probably shouldn't) then this movie fits the bill.

Except for one obviously tacked-on mile-high tryst, some other thrown in gratuitously violent snake attacks, the profanity, and Samuel L. Jackson, this was your average TV movie of the week.

They set up a fairly decent story, moved it along with a good pace, threw in lots of action, and generally put together a decent escapist movie. Some of the basic premises are ridiculous, and there's too much crude snickering teenager caliber sexual humor, but on the whole, not a bad way to spend the evening.I had high hopes that it would turn into a rubber snake-fest, but it seems I was the only one who came armed.

343,RBlake77,"Lots of fun, but not much else",6,2 January 2007,"I have finally seen ""Snakes On A Plane"" (the DVD came out today), and I can write the review I can honestly say I have been dying to write. It was hard writing this one and trying to keep the hype from clouding my judgement. Anyway, onward! With a title as silly as ""Snakes On A Plane"", I wasn't expecting it to be an Oscar winner. All I cared about was seeing Samuel L. Jackson kick some serious asp. He did just that.While it won't be taking home any Academy Awards, seeing as how it bombed in the box office but will more than make up for any losses in rentals, ""Snakes On A Plane"" does otherwise prove itself to be an entertaining film, even though was a little slow at the beginning and the plot, being tissue thin as it is, is quickly forgotten.But once the airliner leaves the tarmac, this roller-coaster of silliness kicks it into high gear, and treats the audience to a vast cornucopia of over the top action, mass hysteria, corny dialogue, a little sex, and a generous serving of gory, wince inducing, yet very humorous, death scenes. Even with all that, however, there isn't much that ""Snakes On A Plane"" offers that really sets it apart from all other action films. It makes full use of character archetypes and clichés that are typical of the film's genre, but that's not really a bad thing. It probably wasn't meant to be taken seriously, anyway.Amidst the shenanigans, the film manages to introduce a bit of biting social commentary. Whether or not it's intentional by the film's producers, writing staff, or whatever, it touches on how many Americans react to something ""foreign"", since it turns out that many of the snakes are not native to American soil. Although I may be making a bit of a stretch to make a point here, this is somewhat galvanised near the end of the film, when it's mentioned that one of the snakes is indigenous to the Middle East (or words to that effect), and someone else says something about it being illegal.Social commentary aside, I give ""Snakes On A Plane"" 3½ stars out of 5, and recommend the film based solely on its entertainment value. It's not much more than a par action film riding a wave of internet hype, but it's not the worst thing out there. It's something to see with a bunch of friends for some mindless fun.",Snakes on a Plane

I realized something when I exited the theater, fresh from the prescreening of Snakes on a Plane (SoaP) at the cinema at which I work, that I may never again see another film that rocks this hard. If you are looking for a deep introspective look at the horrors of airborne terrorism and reptilian exploitation, look somewhere else, and don't complain about it. If you are like me, and I would assume you are since you are reading my review, and are looking for a solid hour and a half of ass-kickery, then congratulations. You just hit the jackpot with SoaP. I can honestly say that the film lived up to my every expectation. I was so pumped by the end of the movie that I threw my shoes across the (empty) theater in a fit of ecstasy. I kid you not.Boiled down to its very essence, SoaP is the pretty much the essence of all that is manly. Think of it like an anti-chick flick. If you enjoy any of the following, then this movie is for you: gruesome deaths, breasts, cheesy physical humor, Samuel L. Jackson, or venomous reptiles. If not, then you clearly have a vagina, but may still manage to enjoy SoaP.Plot is pretty thin, something generic about a kid (Nathan Phillips) who witnessed a mob murder and has to be transported to L.A. to testify in court, but I doubt anyone will mind. We know the basic story. There is a plane in the air that has both venomous snakes and Samuel L. Jackson on board. Samuel L. Jackson defeat snakes in a number of thoroughly awesome ways, which I will not reveal as to not diminish their awesomeness, and simultaneously deals with whiny, stereotypical frightened passengers. Trust me though, seeing the snakes rampaging through the plane and wreaking havoc on said stereotypical passengers is indeed sweet.The acting is as solid as one could hope for from this cast. Jackson takes front and center stage, obviously. He saw the called the pitch, took a beefy swing and hit one into the upper decks. As for the rest of the cast, they did a decent job. Keenan Thompson actually doesn't suck, Nathan Phillips was solid enough, and Julianna Margulies did a fine job.Honestly, I can think of no reason not to see Snakes on a Plane. Sure, the critics will lambaste it left and right. There's no doubt about that. However, coming from someone who is ready to accept the film for what it is, I can honestly recommend it to anyone who can appreciate its nostalgic, cheese-ball appeal.All things considered, Snakes on a Plane will undoubtedly be the most enjoyable, and the most unlikely blockbuster of the summer.

346,The-Silent-Photoplayer,Save your money and your dignity.,1,19 August 2006,"SNAKES ON A PLANE is a bad film. And no, it's not of the ""so bad it's good"" genre, it's of the ""how did this even get greenlighted?"" make.The film has no earmarkings of competent film making: its (only) assets are its exploitative title, lead actor and a year's worth of Internet hype. It spends no time giving you such minor elements as a plot, character development or even character background-- we're simply flung into the story and expected to enjoy it.Clichés abound around every corner, and predictability is the name of the game for ""SoaP"" (which is what you'll want to wash yourself with after sitting through this stinker). The CGI is simply abominable, clearly an indication of this film's ""B"" budget. The opening shot of the plane taking off into a storm looks like it was lifted out of a Sony PlayStation video game. Oh yeah, PlayStation is among the SCORES of items that suffer through product placement throughout the film. I'm sure Nintendo is gloating right now.Yeah, I got the joke. It just wasn't funny. It's supposed to be a farce. But you wouldn't know it from all of the deadpan performances. Samuel L. Jackson, whose work I admire quite well, is completely exploited in a role that will come back to haunt him, I'm sure.The opening night crowd that attended the film with me is exactly why people over 25 don't go to the theater anymore. Noisy, arrogant, cell phones out and shouting at the screen. I felt like I was in the Mystery Science Theater, except nothing said was even remotely funny. I suppose all this will jive if you're a nerdy adolescent of this generation who is pumped up on Red Bull, studio hype and dressed up as Batman for a midnight screening, but for the rest of us who have taste, do yourself a favor and pick another film.",Snakes on a Plane
347,twilightseer,"Boy, where to start...",2,3 September 2007,"According to what I read in the 'Trvia' section for this movie, Samuel Jackson accepted the part only because of the title. Well, maybe reading the script would have been a good idea too. ""Snakes On A Plane"" is actually a wreck on all levels. It manages to be simultaneously 1) absolutely silly 2) boring 3) not the slightest bit scary and 4) moralizing.1) Silliness. The basic concept is already far-fetched (how about hiring a good ol' hit-man to do the job?) but the result is filled to the brim with things that are so stupid that the film just can't work. Random examples: some characters die instantly with one bite, others will survive. If all the snakes are supposed to be deadly, why does this happen? At some point, the co-pilot sees snakes crawling out of his dashboard. But he keeps piloting the plane like nothing happens. Of course, it's the kind of thing that a plane pilot will see every day. Later, said co-pilot is left for dead but then comes back miraculously, before dying for good. Can anyone explain that? No, and the screenwriters can't either. Want some more? How about the mini-flamethrower that the hostess (played by Julianna Margulies of E.R. fame; did she need money that bad?) carries with herself? Are we supposed to believe a civilian could have such a weapon? But the icing on the cake is undoubtedly the fact that one of the passengers claims to be able to pilot the plane; we find out that in fact, his only experience is playing flight simulation video games (by the way, the Playstation and Xbox consoles get mentioned by name by Jackson; hello, product placement). Of course, the guy pilots the plane flawlessly because piloting a Boeing, as everybody knows, is just as easy as playing a flight simulator. I could carry on ad nauseam but I'll leave it at that.2) & 3) The movie is absolutely not scary, and therefore totally boring. The snakes are so obviously CGI'ed that you just can't be scared at all. Also, the special effects during the snakes' big attack are so visible that you just can't feel involved. You're always aware that it's a movie and a bad one at that. As a result, the movie is boring and you just can't wait until the snakes actually finish the job, or the plane crashes (I was hoping for either to happen; unfortunately, it doesn't).4) Finally, I would like to point out something that has really bothered me. All ""disaster movies"" have a typology of easily identifiable characters, who often boil down to a cliché. It's always interesting to see which characters will survive and which ones won't because it says a lot about the mentality of the writers. ""Snakes On A Plane"" manages to gather almost all the clichés and politically correct views that you can pack in a Hollywoodian blockbuster: the bad guy is obviously an Asian while the uber-cool cop and the fatso who saves the day are black; the first people who get killed are a couple of lovers who go at it in the plane's toilet while smoking a joint (get it, people? Sex and drugs are just bad for you!); the businessman who doesn't like kids and dogs is killed by the biggest snake of all (get it, people? You have to like kids and dogs!); the two kids who travel without their parents of course survive, although one is bitten by a snake (you didn't think of them would die, did you?); the slim woman who has a baby survives too (you didn't think etc...) while the ugly obese kidless one dies etc. The most revealing thing however is a line in which Samuel Jackson says something along the lines of ""You can either die or trust the government"". This sounds like a perfect summary of what the US leaders could tell the US people.I'll stop there. ""Snakes On A Plane"" plain sucks. Quite funnily, Jackson perfectly sums up the viewer's feelings when he says ""Enough is enough! I have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!"". I couldn't agree more.",Snakes on a Plane

There was an item on our radios in New Zealand that some ""prankster"" had released two live snakes -- diamond-backed rattlesnakes -- in the theatre at Phoenix, Arizona, during a screening on the opening weekend, This was, perhaps, a novel idea but certainly a stupid and very dangerous one. By some miracle, no one in the theatre was injured and both snakes were captured and later released in the desert. One was captured in the car park, so it can be assumed that the snake was just appalled at the standard of the movie his or her cousins were acting in, and just couldn't stay long enough to bite anyone!",Snakes on a Plane
349,chocoer,Viewer Participation a MUST,9,17 August 2006,"I caught the 10 o'clock showing on Thursday of this movie, and I hope every theater is as pumped up about it as those in that theater were. Bring fake snakes, hiss when you think snakes are coming, cheer when Jackson comes onto the screen, scream 'snake vision' when the opportunity arises, and be as pumped about the movie as humanly possible! It makes the movie a thousand times better and you'll have a blast. Trust me, everyone in the theater will join right in.The movie itself was everything I hoped it could be. Jackson was at his finest and his anticipated lines were perhaps better than could have been hoped for. See this movie, bring a group of friends, and just go nuts",Snakes on a Plane

No chance of spoilers here because I wouldn't waste my time writing much about this farce of a screen play. It's just the same tired old formula. Old clichés, bad special effects and, as usual, portraying animals in a totally different way to reality. Snakes seem to come top of the list when it comes to gross exaggeration. Alright, you're not supposed to take it seriously...it's tongue in cheek stuff and all that, but this is just plain stupid. The screen writers are cashing in as usual on mindless violence, but even worse, with absolutely no originality. It's all the same old stuff. It's just as pathetic as Anaconda.",Snakes on a Plane

The only thing I didn't like is two animals died(not snakes, a cat and a dog.). This film has a great plot, great action, and some pretty funny sequences. For instance, the pilot died and they needed someone to drive the plane. A guy said he had experience. He got up to the wheel and it ended up having been a Playstation 2 game!!! I highly recommend this movie, whether you like snakes or not. Definitely if it wouldn't have been for the animals dying it would have gotten a 10 out of 10 from me, but Since animals die I gave it a 9 out of 10. This is a masterpiece.",Snakes on a Plane

This movie is simply horrible and its entire plot and horrible acting made my stomach churn with disgust. Fortunately I did not spend money to watch this viewing catastrophe but wish there was some way I could go back in time and spare the miserable 2 hours I wasted of my life watching this horrible conglomeration of cheese. I wanted to quit the movie only 15 minutes into it, but decided to finish, despite the agonizing pain so that I could truthfully review and vote on this epic disaster. What sickens me even more than the two hours of misery I subdued watching the movie is reading positive reviews of the movie on this website. I am sad that I typically trust most ratings on this website and then find out that this movie is rated way too high. Anything more than a 2 rating for this movie is simply a lie and must have been posted by someone involved with the movie in attempt to trick people into watching it.Please beware and expect the worst movie production of this decade.",Snakes on a Plane

Once the initial premise is set up, it's a series of all sorts of snakes going on a random killing spree on a plane. There is no suspense. It's not funny. There is no characterization. It's an insult to any half-way intelligent person. Any direct to video b-movie you watch on the Sci-fi channel will be far more entertaining and probably have just as good special effects. It is just amazing to me that a major studio could produce such a horribly offensive movie. What is truly disturbing is the number of people on this board who actually claim they love this film. What a sad state of affairs.",Snakes on a Plane
354,Animal89,What you see is what you get.,6,21 August 2006,"It only takes one look at the poster to be able to guess exactly what ""Snakes on a Plane"" is going to be like and it lives up to expectations. Claustrophobic environments with people being munched by poorly animated snakes, with some terrorist or mad science sub-plot being the feeble excuse for the whole thing. That's it.Samuel Jackson is as to be expected; rough, tough and full of his trademark attitude and wit. He is supported by a handful of stereotypical stewards/stewardesses, a few amateur heroes and a collection of impossibly curvy blondes. The flight also includes all the stereotypical passengers that you will see in every disaster film including ""Airplane"". These include the kids flying alone, the newly weds, the horny couple, the fat woman, the woman with the baby and who could forget the snotty Brit. As for the plot, the title says it all. It's called ""Snakes on a Plane"" and that's pretty much what its all about. There's no real sub-plots, twists or hidden meanings, just an idle stroll though every cliché you can list in the exact order you list them.Sure ""Snakes on a Plane"" was stupid. Sure the acting was poor, the characters thin and the CGI cheap. But despite that this film provided a well structured thriller that provided just under two hours on pure entertainment.In the modern film market, this film is a refreshing return to the classic B-movie, creature feature genre. It requires no scientific explanation, no Award winning performances and no real story. Instead it provides pure entertainment with a few cruel laughs and cheap shocks.So don't watch this film to look for a hidden meaning because you won't find one. Don't dig into the plot because all you'll find is holes. The best way to enjoy it is to just sit back and accept it for what it is. You won't be blown away but you won't be disappointed either. Also recommended (Deep Rising) (Deep Blue Sea) (Anaconda)",Snakes on a Plane
355,heejoo,the snakes looked too animated ....,6,25 February 2007,"... which made it kind of special and fun sometimes. There were also a couple of cool lines but not the ones coming from Jackson. When he said ""enough is enough, I've had it with these mother.... snakes on this mother.... plane"" I almost vomitted, because it's so typical him in every goddamn movie he contributes to: that perplex stare and those upset words every time again over and over ... it was his thing for Pulp Fiction but does he really need to do the character in every movie? Just makes me sick. Otherwise he's an OK actor. Also a couple of things didn't really make sense. I know now that male snakes become very violent when they sense feromones, but what I didn't know was that they would be able to fly an airplane. Also at the end Samuel L Jackson shoots a window in the plane, then he calmly turns around and pulls the cord that is attached to door of the cockpit. All the remaining snakes miraculously get sucked outside. Jackson and the other guy get into the cockpit and are still communicating (normally because of the pressure inside you wouldn't be able to hear anything). Finally the guy, who is a champ at some flight simulator game on playstation 2, and who had never been into a real cockpit before, sits down, knows his way around the main board and lands the plane like an expert.In real life, if 400 poisonous snakes drugged with feromones would be set free on an airplane, the thing would be coming down in about 5 minutes.Still I thought the movie was pretty entertaining. It certainly wasn't boring, too cliché or badly played by the actors ... 6/10",Snakes on a Plane

It's not the BEST movie... it isn't uplifting, it doesn't offer any social commentary whatsoever, and it will not challenge your perception of the world at large. However, we've had an abundance of such think-pieces in the recent past, and now, it's time for something we've never seen before.I'm sure many people will refer to Snakes on a Plane as a ""mindless action flick"", which is not an unfair title. It should be noted, however, that this movie is not your AVERAGE mindless action flick. Snakes does not offer your typical ""hero sets out to foil a terror attack; explosions, quirky sidekicks and punchy one-liners ensue"" action movie formula. It's half-action, half-horror, and a rule breaker on both sides, as it's not your typical horror movie, either. There is no trick to defeating the snakes; only the goal of survival. There is no surcease from danger. There is no crazy madman serial killer. There is no precedent or dullness... just them m'effin' snakes.If you tend to turn up your nose at no-brain-required fun and adventure, then please, don't bother seeing this movie.

I had to see the film because of the hype and generally good reviews. What I liked most was that though the premise and plot is completely ridiculous, the actors play it for real. The dichotomy of trash with class is what makes this fun to watch ... but forgettable. However, for all those who rated this a ten (and yes I know that most of you who rated this a ten are simply and satirically continuing this internet phenomenon ) have you ever seen a real movie???Or ... as least ... have you seen Tremors? It could easily be re-named WORMS in the DESERT. It has the same ridiculous sort of plot, but it's actually more fun to watch. And nobody's penis had to get bitten to get a laugh.

359,eflaat,Settle down fanboys...,6,18 August 2006,"Look the movie was okay, it gave you what it advertised but its not the holy grail man. Is Hollywood getting so bad to where something that just says its got SNAKES ON A PLANE and gives you SNAKES ON A M*&@$&^$ PLANE causes the entire general population (and nerds, dorks, dweebs, fanboys, chunk heads, 40 year old virgins, that Ain't it cool guy) to off and praise it ad infinatum? Really people, be more critical and stop falling in line to hype. Apparently, we've reached a phase where Hollywood crap is digested much more easily than the good stuff. Who would've thought we've just given directors and hack screenwriters the green-light to make even cornier movies with impunity since our expectations are so low. Hey, now you don't even have to get a GED to write the next blockbuster. Just put some ridiculous combination together and bam, people are gonna flock to something like 'Boobs with nunchucks' (don't try that, I'm already writing a spec screenplay with Jessica Simpson as lead, got full backing from the Weinsteins AND Eisner) This is simply a dumb popcorn movie with a plot thinner than Paris Hilton's sex tape. Hollywood can give us better and our expectations are so low that we pay $8 at the box office in droves to see a movie like this because this week nothing else even comes close. That's right, nothing coming out of Hollywood this second is more impressive than SNAKES ON A PLANE. Which probably means Hollywood is out of ideas. I'd bet anyone $50 this was written by some guy with a laptop and screen writing for dummies book at Starbucks and completed in a single lunch break.And just to show people here how bad it is, SoaP is currently 8.4, that means it is rated more favorably than: Chinatown, Hotel Rwanda, M, the Maltese Falcon, Aliens, A Clockwork orange, Reservoir Dogs, Ragin Bull, Saving Pvt. Ryan, Braveheart, Blade Runner, Cool Hand Luke, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and Rashomon. Seriously people, improve your tastes a bit.

Although to be fair, the acting of one or two of the human cast might well have the same affect on you! Samuel L. Jackson is just about the only person who holds the film together in any cohesive and sensible fashion, although his acting skills definitely aren't tested to their limit, in holding this rather limp script up for too much critique.The film's ending left me thinking ""WHAT ..."", or rather the non-ending that it turned into, as he surfed off into the sunset! Having said all that, for a couple of hours free television entertainment, it was okay, although I definitely wouldn't have paid to either watch the film at the cinema, or bought it on DVD.I shall certainly be checking under the bed and in the wardrobe top-boxes tonight and I might even sleep with the light on!",Snakes on a Plane

Before watching the movie I have realized whats inside the movie so first thing is that this movie is predictable and no suspense or thrilled suspense. The Director of the movie has really worked hard to ensure plenty of snakes and their breeds in the movie .You can see the snakes with wide range and afcourse they were in action in the movie. I credit them for lead role in the movie.This movie is also good for creating surrounding atmosphere fit for the situation inside the plane. Director well knew that it was little he can do to make it thrilling inside the plane but with his worth working he managed to get out smartly in the picturisation of above movie. He is good in delivery and thats the prime focus of the movie. all actors have been good in their parts and role and made this movie visible to large section of audience I wish the Director all good luck for his future venture go and check the movie its good -worth watching bye vinod,Snakes on a Plane

There was a kick boxer on the plane who I expect to give a spinning back kick to a snake. I wanted Jackson to punch a snake in the face. Snakes On A Plane was so hyped to be over the top.

I saw it in a near empty drive-in and you could hear the laughs from the other cars 40 feet away.It was a bit tongue in cheek as was expected at times, but also took itself far more serious than expected at others. The plot line and 'surprises' were predictable and for almost every step of the movie the characters were way behind the curve in that they came up with an idea well after the audience had already thought of it.Now I didn't hate this film because I was expecting cheese and it delivered. The rating is simply that it probably won't withstand a second viewing by almost anyone and the entertainment is from simply laughing at (not with) the plot, characters, effects, redefinition of physical laws, inaccuracies, flair for the predictable and silly dialog.

This is a funny movie, and sheer ridiculous situations and scientific impossibilities abound(a snake manages to eat a dog in about 2 seconds).Don't expect to be blown away.

Snakes, some gore and Sam Jackson. The plot is simple enough. A man is witness to a murder by a crime lord and Sam Jackson is an FBI agent protecting the witness until he can get to LA from Hawaii to testify.

I thought what is the film industry coming to and why is Samuel L Jackson in this, is he that desperate?? As weeks passed and it got nearer to its release date in the UK I realised the title was part of a much hyped marketing scheme which worked superbly well and looking back well done on picking SOAP as the title!!!Anyway about the film, first of all, all you high brow intellectual wannabe's probably wont like it or accept it because lets face it, it's cheesy, over the top, stupid, moronic, and the acting isn't Oscar worthy but then I will also say to you its called ""SNAKES ON A PLANE""!!! your not going to get a best picture award and great acting with a title like that. The title basically tells you this is a stupid over the top horror. If you went in with an open mind and didn't expect a tense well thought out horror then you I think you would have enjoyed it. If you like snakes biting on the sort of human parts that can only be added for comedy value, you would have enjoyed this. If you like snakes eating a spoilt 'Paris Hilton-esq' dog then you will enjoy this. If you like quotes like "" Snakes on Crack....Great!!"" and of course "" I'm tired of these mother******* snakes on this mother******* plane""!!"" then you will LOVE this film.Samuel L Jackson delivers probably his most high action part to date and may well be remembered better for this than his exceptional acting in Pulp Fiction. He delivers lines like no one else could and makes gives the a certain amount of 'coolness'tongue in cheek humour is delivered with every change of scene and Kenan Thompson (from Kenan & Kel) fades the film out in the only way it could be done with 10 minutes of eye watering comedy. Him and Jackson end the film with as funnier 5 minutes as I've seen in the film industry.

However I found Snakes On A Plane better than I thought, yes its a brainless Samuel L Jackson vehicle, but it is not without merits. The plot (A witness to a gang execution is being flown from Honalulu to LA to give evidence with Samuel L as escort) is simple and basically serves as an excuse to fill a 747 with a load of snakes. The rest of the film is sort of cross between a disaster flick and a horror b-movie. Loads of annoying people get bitten and in some cases eaten and some other annoying people are saved by good old Samuel L. (Athough I wish at least one of the cute kiddies could have got it!!) However it is well done and the snakes do indeed come over with a touch of menace about them and there are some nice set pieces such as the mile high club couple, the death of the yappie dog and the bloke with a snake bitten cock.Don't go to see this film expecting high entertainment, but if it's some laugh out loud and make yer jump easy going entertainment you crave then this film is well worth a glance, even if the ending is very predictable.",Snakes on a Plane

It was much like I expected from Samuel L. Jackson. It had his normal movie flavor and some pretty funny scenes. Most of it you knew was going to happen before it did.It really was a light, fun movie with action and comedy mixed in. Sometimes people take their movies far too seriously and this isn't one of them. Sure the snakes look animated but seriously...it's a movie called - Snakes on a Plane. What do you expect? I really enjoyed watching it and will probably end up buying it. It's worth checking out if you really like Samuel L. Jackson! You won't be disappointed!",Snakes on a Plane
380,sneezewhiz,Snakes on a Plane - what can you say?,7,18 August 2006,"This movie was made mostly to have 90 or 100 minutes of celluloid to put after what's arguably the best movie title ever: Snakes on a Plane. A gangster, attempting to kill a someone, manages to smuggle a collection of poisonous snakes of every imaginable species on board a 747. They pretty much took one of the Airport movies from the 1970's, then threw in a bunch of snakes to make everything happen. I jumped two times and didn't jump at least one other time. The guy a couple seats over jumped two times that I didn't jump. Samuel Jackson delivers a Samuel Jackson performance, as a Samuel Jackson good guy character. All the other actors played stock characters as well as anyone could play them. As long as you suspend your disbelief, and don't ask too many questions, it's a good way to kill time at a matinée. I'm going to check out the DVD, because I can think of a couple of good scenes that must have been cut.",Snakes on a Plane
381,kurt_kennett,Best Cheese I've had in a long time,9,18 August 2006,"It's very hard to make a movie that entertains, nay I say panders, to the more carnal urges - fear, thrill, and adrenaline rush. This movie is a ton of fun to experience, and it's because of -bear with me now- the story. Yes, the story.There's many ways to tell a story. I'm not talking about the duologue, the plot, the characters, or even the setting. I'm talking about the situation and the roles involved in it.Yes, the snakes are the villains in this, and yes the heroes do the heroic things (as we expect them to in a good story). It's the *experience* of the situation and the immersion you can get into with the over-the-top-ness of it. You've seen these roles before. You've seen this situation before. When I watched this movie it had serious rumblings of 'Aliens' and other movies like it. Even 'Kill Bill' came to mind with the situation of the passengers and the odds they face. What makes it unique and fun to experience is the details of how it's told, the familiarity, and the slight twists and nuances of seeing 'what if' the road twisted in this way or that way.Bottom line, it kept me guessing the whole way through because I knew the filmmakers felt the freedom to do anything they wanted to do. To pretty much any character, and in pretty much any way. You don't see that kind of freedom in a lot of thriller movies any more. When was the last time you were genuinely skeptical of whether Harrison Ford's character was going to make it? You're not - because you know the safety zone that the movie is playing in.This movie has no safety zone. That doesn't mean that there is no line it doesn't cross. This just means that the filmmakers just said ""what would be cool to have happen in this situation?"" Somebody gave an answer, and *nobody* said ""Oh, we can't do that."" 9 out of 10. Worth my $$.",Snakes on a Plane
382,nbellechan,A Stupid Movie To Begin With,1,2 June 2007,"It was a terrible movie, to tell you the truth. I cannot believe that people thought this was nice, when in fact, it's a pure piece of crap. You must admit that the plot of this movie is entirely impossible thus, making is corny and very fake.First of all, why all the profanity? I think it would have a cleaner image when they made the language better and stuff because the even tagline is pure of curse words. a bit of that stuff just shows what normal scenario it is in, but the swearing just makes it entirely fake. I would suggest that they lessen the NUDE scenes and the cursing, and it would help the crap of a movie a lot.I would also like to comment about the plot of the whole thing. Honestly, I doubt that you could get a thousand snakes on a plane. By all the strict inspections before flight, it is highly unlikely that this would happen thus, making it again very unnatural.The acting was also terrible, and they could have gotten better people, but apparently, they had a very low budget on the movie, so everything was so fake from the effects, to the snake themselves.Also, i don't know why people found the movie exciting and all when the whole thing was very predictable and typical bad movie these days. I don't understand why most of the voters thought it was nice when the whole thing was entirely corny.",Snakes on a Plane

It was interesting to see some actors at the beginning of their careers, which was the one notable thing about it.

385,MechaWingZero,"I don't care what anyone says, I love this film.",10,7 February 2012,"I remember when this movie came out in theaters. I was fourteen-years-old and back then I used to spend a ton of time on Newgrounds.com. So naturally, I knew about it long before it was released due to all the internet hype. Not only do I like B movies but I have always had a strong fascination with herpetology. Snakes are my favorite animals. Needless to say I wanted to see Snakes on a Plane. However, my mother heard radio talk-show host Michael Medved give a whole speech on how he felt the content that had been added to make the film rated R instead of PG-13 (as demanded by internet bloggers) made the film inappropriate for his son. Predictably, my mom didn't let me see it in the theaters after hearing this segment (if you are curious to hear it just google ""michael medved snakes on a plane"" or something, it'll come right up). I told myself I would watch this movie when I left the house, and I did.Now that I'm older and I've seen this movie, I realize that it is unquestionably one of my favorite movies. It just does what so few movies seem to do, and that's deliver completely. Were you hoping that it'd be about deadly snakes on a plane that's flying over the pacific ocean? It is. Were you hoping it would have Samuel L. Jackson in it? It does. Were you hoping for it to be comedic? It is. What pleasantly surprised me is how likable the characters other than Samuel L. Jackson's are. Obviously none of them are going to get an Oscar, but I commend them for being much better than I would have thought or hoped for. This might be the second best acting I've seen in a B-grade film, with the best easily being Slither (2006).The other thing about this movie is that it is very hard to put it into one genre. In some respects it is like an action film, as it is very fast paced and contains gunplay. It's also equally like a thriller, as there are a lot of those ""edge of your seat"" moments of suspense. It's also a lot like a horror film in that there is a body count and other gruesome elements. And of course, people who are terrified of snakes may find the film very frightening (I know a girl who would have to get counseling for months if she ever saw this. How scary it is will depend on how afraid of snakes you are.). On top of this, the plot and concept are so ridiculous and absurd that it adds a lot of humor throughout the movie, so much so that you may even be able to call it a comedy. In fact, the only ""genre"" that it entirely belongs to is that it is a ""B movie"" in every sense of the word, if you can even consider that a genre. I don't even need to say that there are inaccuracies and mistakes. With a movie like this, that's inevitable. However, if you're in the right mindset, this can even make it more entertaining. I've read some people complain about the venomous snakes being CGI and therefor looking fake, but let me opine that the CGI snakes are actually well done. Can you tell that they are CGI? Well yes (as with nearly any CGI effect), but that doesn't mean they don't look cool or convincing. The lighting is perfect to make them seem as real as possible. And of course, they also used 450 harmless snakes on the set, and this definitely helps add credibility.As to whether I would recommend it to you or not, I would say that you should just ask yourself one simple question: ""Do I like the title and concept?"" If your answer is yes, watch the movie, because it totally delivers. If your answer is no, then you definitely will dislike this movie. Lastly, some have said that audience participation in the theater was such a huge part of the movie that it wouldn't be worth watching on DVD. While I would have loved to have seen the audience participation, I certainly enjoyed watching this on DVD, enough to have a copy on my shelf.",Snakes on a Plane
386,zandurian,S O A P is an amazingly fun movie,7,19 August 2006,"Out of everything expected from a movie that was cliché enough to laugh at itself, starting with the title, I found myself wondering why there wasn't an in-flight movie. I enjoyed the interesting ways the snakes attacked and bit the passengers, especially in the beginning. The action was non stop and of course Samuel made the whole experience a classic. There wasn't a lot of background on the characters to really care too much for any of them, but the main characters were likable enough. Mary Kate was such a Bi*ch. Go see it, there is nothing boring about this movie, the action doesn't stop. The only other suggestion I have is don't stay for the video, now that was bad....",Snakes on a Plane
387,reidster21,A serious critique--the movie event of the summer,10,18 August 2006,"I really have felt up to this point that the summer blockbusters were fairly lackluster; Most of the big name movies all left a little something to be desired. The DaVinci Code and MI:3 started the summer off in a somewhat exciting fashion, but neither movie really delivered the bang that was expected for the cost and the hype. X3 was OK, but it again left me feeling like there was something missing. POTC 2 was virtually a segway into POTC 3 and was way overly praised, and on the comedy scene, Nacho Libre was OK, and Talladega Nights was definitely not Will Ferrel at his best, but still managed to deliver a few laughs.So as the summer has been winding down, I prepared to go see a movie that had such a dumb premise that it couldn't be anything but funny in the sense that it was horrible. The title of the freakin' movie sums up the whole plot line, and a quick look at the first name on the cast list will tell you what to expect from character development-nothing. I was sure this movie would suck. I was ready to say that this summer had been filled with repeats of previous ideas and a few poorly played out new ideas. To be fair, I haven't seen a few movies with I have heard are excellent, but those movies were not blockbusters by any stretch of the imagination.So I went in to the theater in Union Station tonight, sat down with a friend, and prepared to be disappointed yet again-but this movie delivered what none of the other movies this summer possibly could have. I decided to break my review down into some subcategories to make it easier to follow.Comedy- This movie is without a doubt the funniest movie of the summer. The filmmakers knew exactly what they were doing and they made the situations funny and backed it up with the perfect lines. The movie didn't take itself seriously, which is why the comedy worked so well.Action- Look at the title of the movie. You now know to expect about an hour of snakes on a plane, with about thirty minutes of build up time. The action and gore delivered what no other movie of the summer could-intensity and violence. Lets not kid ourselves, thats what you want to see in an action movie. Also, a few very well developed unexpected heroes really helped move the action along (as did the stereotypical helpless female actresses in this movie).Character Development- Surprisingly, this was probably the best aspect of the film-making. The character development was actually really good. You could see changes in certain characters as the movie progressed and the characters were all very individualized. There was occasionally weak interaction between characters which is easily attributed to a few inexperienced actors, but it doesn't seem to take much away from the movie.Plot- Seems dumb based upon the movie title. The plot is what you expect, with just about everything you would expect occurring, aside from one thing-lack of explanation. They actually explained the premise well enough, and plausibly enough, that I was easily able to suspend my disbelief and love the crazy idea behind this movie.In parting, I just want to say go to this movie with the right attitude, and you will love it. I don't even think you really have to have a great attitude to love this movie. I don't know how anyone could dislike this... its funny, its action-packed; its a really good movie.Given the fact that it was the movie of the summer, it will get my one ten star rating for this summer season.",Snakes on a Plane
388,chriscc-3,My all-time favorite movie!!!,10,18 August 2006,"Let me tell you about my experience seeing Snakes on a Plane. I was with my cousin and my mother (lame, i know) both of which thought this was going to be the worst movie of all time. Everyone in the theater gave the movie a standing ovation at these times: when the title showed, when Samuel Jackson said his first line, when the snakes first broke out of their crate, the first time a snake killed someone (great scene,) the first time Samuel killed a snake, when the angry businessman threw the dog at the huge snake, and, of course when Samuel said his famous line. This one was the biggest. The whole theater joined in the line, and we were clapping so loud I barely heard what was going on after that line. And, of course, at the end. Now, on to the review... You really can't ask for more in a movie. It's got great acting, good special FX, good cast, an OK plot, and of course, snakes on a plane. Go see this movie. You will be blown away. 10/10. Amazing. My favorite movie of all time (though the Godfather comes close.) Oh, and by the way. My cousin and my mom both thought the movie was amazing after, and were among those chanting the motha-f****n' snakes line. That proof enough?",Snakes on a Plane
389,Derrick-10,The Rocky Horror of this generation,10,18 August 2006,"I went to the opening night of SoaP expecting to be disappointed in all honesty. I thought there was no possible way that they could live up to the hype, that it wouldn't be entertaining, etc. Now, I'm trying to figure out how many shows I should try to go to during opening weekend.The plot is an atrocity and the acting is pathetic, granted. But, as everyone else has stated, its called Snakes on a Plane for crying out loud, if you need a well developed story go put Citizen Kane on your Netflix queue. The excitement in the theater was palpable as even during the previews people dressed up in snake costumes were yelling ""bring out the mother****** snakes!!!"" By the middle of the movie, people were hootin' and hollerin' and shouting things like ""Shoot that f***** snake, Sam!!!"". The couple next to me spilled a huge thing of Diet Coke all over themselves. People waved plastic snakes and after every great Sam Jackson line, a raucous cheer erupted. I was in tears due to my inability to stop laughing. When Jackson utters his famous line, people jumped out of their seats to cheer. After the movie was over, strangers were high fiving each in the lobby, calling their friends frantically to tell them to get tix for tomorrow night.Who cares what serious movie critics think of it? What movie in recent memory has created such an atmosphere amongst movie goers? The hilarity of the guy getting his Johnson bitten off, the ridiculous coincidences (the Mexican lady who knows how to cut open snake bites and gargle venom with olive oil, the fat kid who can fly a play after playing video games), the gratuitous sex scenes, the flagrant product placement, snake vision...it was absolutely absurd, and completely enjoyable. Not the best movie I've seen, but far and away the most fun I've had at a movie theater.",Snakes on a Plane
390,shop_a_holic,Better Than Expected,8,27 August 2006,"""Snakes on a Plane"". I can somewhat easily see where one could have reason to believe this movie would be bad. When this movie came out in theaters, I was quite excited to see it. Some of the people coming with me were a bit reluctant to do so, for they thought this movie would be ""stupid"".To their surprise, it was phenomenal! The acting was great, even though the movie contained what I thought to be average characters: The ditsy rich girl, the hotshot superstar rapper and his two suck up assistants, the irritated stuck up rich man, the nervous guy who hates planes, the kids flying without their parents for the first time, the tough and heroic FBI agent (Samuel L. Jackson), etc. I thought each of these characters and more added a little flare to the movie that made it more interesting. There was also a hint or two of comedy, and not just your typical barely funny one liners, but physical comedy that is not just from the actors, but from the vicious snakes too! Eddie Kim (a dangerous criminal wanted by the authorities for quite some time) has committed a grisly murder of a powerful attorney that was witnessed by an ordinary guy. To lock up Kim in the big house for good, the witness must fly from Hawaii to California to testify. Of course Kim does not want to be prosecuted, so he concocts what I think to be a brilliant and clever plan: Fill the plane the witness is riding with hundreds of deadly and venomous snakes. Now the question simply is, will the plane make it safely across the ocean? In conclusion, do not let the title and/or previews of ""Snakes on a Plane"" convince you to pass this movie up. You do not really have to prefer gritty and suspenseful action films to enjoy this movie, because ""Snakes on a Plane"" is much more than that. It is actually an intelligent and gripping movie that really captured my interest. I have to admit though that within the first few scenes, I began to assume this would just be your average action flick, no better or worse than any before or after it. Then, the movie really took off, and became something good. Maybe I should just put it this way: When it is released on DVD and PSP, there's no question about it, I am definitely purchasing it!",Snakes on a Plane

I didn't spend a lot of time getting involved in the hype. I just finally saw the movie primarily because I like Samuel L. Jackson. And while this film is not a great, steaming pile of garbage, it's not exactly the greatest movie ever made, either. The title, of course, gives you everything you need to know about the plot, and if you just take a moment to switch off your brain before viewing the film, you just might have an entertaining hour and a half.Definitely a step down for the director, David Ellis, from his very entertaining thriller Cellular, but most definitely not the worst movie I've ever seen.

393,king_ghidora,A fun and thrilling creature film,8,5 January 2010,"""Snakes On a Plane"" may have a lot of cheesy themes to it, but honestly, this is the best movie I've ever seen about snakes. This completely beats Anaconda and whatever stupid movies they made about cobras. SOAP (haha, its abbreviation is soap) is actually a good blend of horror and comedy, there being enough gore to keep horror fans satisfied while having its fix of humor. The most brutal deaths in the film are actually NOT by the snakes, and that shows that the movie has a sense of sophistication in its own way. Complete and utter disaster ensues on the plane; people fall off staircases and are impaled on spike-like things, people trample each other while running, mass turbulence causes chaos in the plane, and eventually, the side of the plane rips open and I'm pretty sure that a few people are sucked out. Also, a man is brutally killed off-screen with a baseball bat. In addition, a DOG gets eaten by a boa constrictor. That scene may upset some viewers, but others may find it pretty funny. ""Snakes On a Plane"" may not be Sam L. Jackson's best, but his acting in the movie is superb and of course stands out over everyone else's. Modern personas of people are stereotyped in the movie, creating comic effect, and of course the annoying stereotypes are the ones that get killed. The snake attacks are intense and even kind of scary at times. The movie is fun, campy, and generally pretty good, so I would definitely recommend it to those interested at all.",Snakes on a Plane

This film hardly takes itself seriously with all of the cheesy dialog and numerous clichés (which do eventually bog down the film by the end).

Jackson combating snakes 30,000 feet in the air, while spouting off the greatest one liner this side of the Pacific! What we have here is the first ""internet movie,"" and it is a rush.

Apparently ""other interests"" included a string of Lifetime movies and the film ""Ghost Ship"". Julianna, tell your agent I said to keep up whatever it is he's doing to help advance your career because it's really working.) Long story short, I was hoping this film would be campy fun but the fun seemed to be missing. The jokes fell flat for me in this one. I did become more engrossed in the film when the snakes arrived and it took a grim and suspenseful turn. The CGI is horrible (I've seen better special effects on a View Master) however they did manage to sneak in a few pop out scenes that made me jump. There are some very intense ""Who's going to die next?"" scenes and some of them are downright depressing. They include a sweet couple on their honeymoon that meet their untimely demise in a god awful manner, a little boy who survives a horrifying snake attack only to suffer in excruciating pain throughout the remainder of the film, and a baby in jeopardy. Though these scenes held my attention, I really wanted more laughs from this film. I wanted this to be a ""great bad"" film that would have made me bust a gut like ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"", ""Blood Feast"", ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and ""Steel Magnolias"".

396,GoldenShadow5184,An alright movie.....,5,2 February 2013,"Seeing that I hadn't seen Snakes on a Plane for quite sometime, I decided to re-watch it yesterday. Right off the back, I must say that ""Snakes on a Plane"" is a pretty convincing title to a movie, and I think that a lot of hype for this movie came due to its title. But anyway, let's get started with the movie! Samuel L. Jackson and David Koechner are the only actors I knew who starred in this film, and yes, this is the movie where Samuel delivers that one line which gained a huge cult following. The first time I saw this movie (years ago) I actually remember liking it a lot. Having re- watched it yesterday, I actually liked it less. Personally, I just thought that much intensity just really wasn't involved in it. I mean, snakes on a plane, yeah, that is a really interesting concept which could make for a fun movie, but sadly, it comes off as....okay. The main characters didn't really have much depth driven into them (Samuel's performance was okay, but I prefer him more in Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained). The guy who plays Sean (guy who Samuel's character has to look after) didn't even do much on the plane. I mean, if you are willing to sit back and turn your brain off while watching this movie you might enjoy it more, but....I'd say I'm okay with the movie, simply because Samuel L. Jackson's in the movie, and because the visuals in the film actually look alright. 5/10",Snakes on a Plane
397,Movie_Reviewing_101,a lot better than I was led to believe.,9,23 August 2006,"This film is a surprising delight. With it's outstanding blend of horror and comedy. Ever since Samuel .L. Jackson mentioned it at the MTV Movie awards, I have been dieing to see it. Especially with the inconceivable amount of hype this film got on the internet, with posters, spoof trailers, and fan-art. With this I am fairly confident that this film will win something at this next years MTV awards.Now I'm going to do something strange. Instead of talking about the film as a whole, I'm going to fixated on one part. What I believe to be the best part. You know what I mean; ""I have had it with these mother f****** snakes, on this mother f****** plane!"" Once this line was uttered, the whole theatre erupted with the cheers and applauding from the rather empty screening. And it is because of this line, that I think that this film will be remembered. For example, The Italian Job had ""only supposed to blow the bloody doors of"". The Shinning had, ""here's Johhny"". So don't be surprised to here teenagers walking down the street describing everything as a mother f******. Despite this really strong sentence. This isn't a huge amount of swearing, which left me felling slightly robbed, as is the reason why I give this film a 9 instead of a 10. But still when the do swear. It's worth the wait.Usually now I would give a brief plot summary but given the hype I don't think it's necessary. This film is a lot better than I was led to believe. With the lack of press screenings, and the quite bad comments it was getting in the tabloids, what was I meant to think. But I can tell you. This is the film of the summer. I would strongly recommend it. There's something for everybody with shocks, laughs and even a brief sex scene.This film is amazing and is showing in theatres now, I suggest you go see it.Oh and the film also brings back a comic great.

398,Nightman11,Snakes on a Plane just another Hollywood sketch,7,6 October 2006,"I went to see Snakes on a Plane at the $1.50 movie theater and I have to say that was all it was worth. I can explain this movie in one expression: snakes on a plane. Sure, hence the title right? The reason I was frustrated by this film is because of its intentions. The idea of this movie is limited to strictly to having snakes attacking people on a plane. There is a sub-plot linking the reasoning of cracked out snakes on a plane killing everyone but it is as weak as it gets. The movie has many flaws but boredom isn't one of them. I will say that I was entertained but the action still was a bit far-fetched. I mean, a snake coming from the toilet and biting the urinating man's package? Come on Hollywood. How low do you have to go before we just aren't laughing anymore? The film was kind of cool but not a 7.5. A serious film without Kenan Thompson saving the day would have been a much better idea.

If the title wasn't enough to get you off your butt and off to see Snakes On A Plane, then I don't know what is. The most fun I had at the theater ever. To fully experience SOAP then I suggest you see it with a full crowd. It is part of the fun, bring rubber snakes, paper planes, bring your friends. Bring whatever you need to enjoy a movie and escape from the world.Its the movie to see in theater because of the audience, energy, and damn is it fun.

400,rrogers2-1,Snakes on the Brain,2,2 October 2006,"Please forgive me for saying this but Snakes on a Plane might be the most important movie of the past ten years...but only because of its viral marketing (people even released a rattlesnake in a theatre showing Snakes on a Plane). Snakes on a Plane's marketing has become such a monster that it is difficult to separate the movie from the marketing. But as entertaining as the catty blogs or the insulting automated phone calls from Samuel L. Jackson can be, Public Enemy put it best when they said ""Don't, don't don't believe the hype."" If I were to describe Snakes on a Plane in one sentence it would be this: Imagine every part of your body you would not want a snake to bite, then see it happen. The violence is really the only aspect of the film that really captures the potential absurdity that us moviegoers (read: Army of Darkness fans) lust for. There are hints of ridiculousness elsewhere, like the funny feeling that everything has been a pretext to get Jackson to say ""I've had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!"" but all of the actors play it straight. There's never a wink and a nod. Which leaves us thinking that a lot of the humor that we are deriving from the movie is tacked on. What I mean is that New Line tried to make a thriller, it ended up sucking, everyone thought it was absurd so they tried to make it even more absurd after it already sucked.On top of this it is pretty boring. The characters are not interesting. In the beginning we are swiftly and cleverly introduced to all of the stereotypical action/thriller characters but it never really goes anywhere. This was a huge disappointment for me. I thought Snakes was setting up a lot of great jokes but no. The only payoff involves a seemingly gay flight attendant and our inaccurate perceptions of him.The action scenes are exceptionally confusing. The shots and the editing make it very difficult to tell who or if someone is bitten, or if Samuel L. Jackson killed that snake. Sometimes films like The Bourne Supremacy will achieve a frantic, confusing look for effect but that just does not seem to be the case here. It seems unintentionally confusing.I guess Snakes on a Plane let me down because I was expecting ridiculous ridiculousness and not gross-out ridiculousness. But hey I got to see a snake bite a girl's boob and I don't know if I will ever have that opportunity again.",Snakes on a Plane

In this case, ""Snake On a Plane"" is example of not judging the book by its cover, the title says nothing about the movie. When I went to the theater, I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane, I was expecting Independence Day, a movie that's pure popcorn fun, but instead, I got that horrible Roy Liotta movie called "" Turbulence"" Yes, this is how bad SOAP is. The only thing make SOAP better is its title. And it's not even the apporiate title for the movie, the wasn't even a glimpse of ""snake"" or ""plane"" 40 minutes into the movie! What a false advertising! If it wasn't for its title, SOAP would be just another unforgettable cheap B-grade summer movie. And the R rating? It has to be the most undeserved R rated movie of all time! The makers of the movie only add a few f word to make this a R, All of the violence are kept pg-13 level. You know what's really R rated? The R rated superstar Edge! See him at Summerslam instead of waste your money on a snake!",Snakes on a Plane
402,hagel666,"Prety fun movie, a nice peace of parody I think",6,19 February 2007,"* some spoilers, not the end or anything but still some spoilers* I was pretty nice to give it 6/10, don't get me wrong, it was pretty fun to watch, but it was pretty stupid, and then some more. The rating is pretty strange, it's now 46% for 10 and 8.2% - 9, 9.4% - 8. Strange if it was that good there would be more 8's and 9's.First IMDb.com genre is Action / Adventure / Thriller, they forgot Comedy. Because if it's not also a comedy I'm amazed, because I laughed a couple of times due to some stupid things.One of those stupid things was the jumping snakes. Everyone who has seen some episodes with the ""Crocodile Hunter"" Steve Irwin or any other snake men, or read about snakes, or checked the internet for myths (as example http://www.oplin.org/snake/myths%20truths/mythstruths.html) - know for sure snakes can't jump. And in this movie you will see a bunch of jumping snakes lol (yeah it's funny).And there is a scene when a guy takes a leak in the toilet and the snake jump out of the can and bites (or sucks) his wiener and he yells something like ""oh no my d i c k"" about 3-4 times until he fell down, that was hysterically funny (but not meant to be funny I guess).Next stupid subject. It was supposed that some pheromones induced the crazy state the snakes entered (in reality snakes doesn't attack people like in the movie, not even close). The bad guys apparently sprayed the pheromones on a lot of flowers in the cargo area and it spread through the plane using the air condition. Then stupid thing is that I'm pretty sure the snakes would go where the scent was strongest, i.e. the cargo room! But they left the cargo room in no time and went for the people instead, like they had any more pheromones than anything else.I have to say, I only enlightened a few circumstances, there is a lot more, but this review would then be way to lengthy.In my mind, I compare this movie to other horror parody movies as Scary Movie and such.",Snakes on a Plane

Having said that, it's pretty funny (not hysterical) because it's loaded with stupid 1970s and 1980s action and disaster movie clichés. If the audience has fun with it then it'll be a party film. In my audience they were laughing and clapping at the death of a clichéd old female lead BECAUSE she was such a tired piece of material. As Jackson's partner dies a cry of ""MENDOZAAAAA!"" goes up from the back of the theater - a reference to a spoof of cop partner films from the Simpsons. I guess it compares to Rocky Horror in the way the audience makes it fun. Except it has no catchy tunes. If I had to watch this alone I would probably die. This is one LOUSY movie. Have fun!P.S.

Sneaking in beer and cashew nuts, and turning it into one big party helps too! Only then, can this rocky horror picture show of a summer movie experience fully be appreciated for the camp that it is. We had so much fun because we knew that everyone was going into this movie, not for plot, but for plenty of opportunities to laugh at bad CGI snakes, awesome Samuel L. Jackson oneliners for life (""I've had it with this motherf*cking snakes, on this motherf*cking plane!""-- elicited so many hoots and hollers from the audience), completely earnest acting in a totally stupid script, and a ridiculous ridiculous premise (damn that eddie kim for buying all those imported snakes with no anti venom available for miles!), and just plain out ridiculous fun.There are so many drinking games that will come alive because of this movie. Like every time there is a different kind of snake mentioned in a trailer or screamed out in the audience or is said in the distant background by a passenger, take one gulp. And there's just great randomness with the characters. The Latina mommy who somehow is like an apothecary, the old stewardess who takes a bit to save that mommy's baby, the kickboxing guy who shows up out of nowhere to save the lady with the dog.watch it for the obnoxious fun that it is, and do it when there are big rowdy crowds around you.",Snakes on a Plane

411,sheilacornuk,They're lovin' it,8,25 August 2006,"Snakes on a Plane dir. David R. Ellis (2006) The camera skims the overblown colours of Hawaiian beachscapes to lyrics about 'A Perfect Day'. It can only mean trouble. Suddenly, a man suspended head-down is telling us to run. In fact, he's addressing a witness to his imminent murder, but it's also a tip off to nervous audience members.Nelville Flynn (Samuel L Jackson) is tasked to escort hapless witness Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) from Hawaii to LA. Whilst his charge is docile enough to heed his warning 'Just do as I say and you'll survive', a planeload of fanged critters high on artificial pheromones plus passengers enraged at travelling 'coach' make Bruce Willis's 'Five Blocks' ordeal look tame.Samuel L Jackson, with help from Julianna Margulies as Claire, the rock-steady stewardess anchor the movie, but the real stars are the snakes: blur-visioned heat-seekers who snack on one another when not biting passengers. They spring out of light fittings, overhead lockers and under deck holds like elongated tubes of fruit pastilles. One spends the entire film wrestling with an Hawaiian neck garland between the aisles, not so much 'Speckled Band' as 'in need of specs' band.The inventive techniques of erstwhile stuntman David R. Ellis enhance 'Snakes on a Plane' as they did 'Final Destination 2.Most of the jokes and the characters are hugely inventive and well prepared. The initial suspended-head-down shot is repeated with snakes throughout, and great play is made with the tangled wires of the planes electrics and their resemblance to the evil-minded slitherers  the films closest homage to 'Alien', apart from the giant python in the air-ducts. The formulaic passengers  egomaniac rock star, lady with yapping dog, children travelling alone are too numerous. On the other hand the ad-hoc use of onboard furniture - the escaped trolleys and inflatable life-rafts, especially the method by which an exasperated Jackson rids the plane of the stripy pests, are all pleasurably recognisable.The end-story involves finding a 'hardcore snake expert' and more could have been done with his geeky persona, although he get the best line, reminding the ground-based police agent to hurry because 'Time is tissue' in collecting lifesaving serum. The pathos and passenger bonding moments fit the pattern of contrasts, creating pockets in the tension. The 'substitute pilot' joke is a masterpiece of slow-realisation comedy.As with Jacky Chan films, it's a mistake to leave before the credits roll. The MTV style ending with spoof airport smuggling scene reprises the energy and exuberance of the best moments in this film that more than fulfils its promise.",Snakes on a Plane
412,nahor88,you'll be on the edge of your seat...,10,19 August 2006,"Lots of people have, and before they see this movie probably will make fun of the simple title. However, once you really get into the thick of it, you won't give the title another thought, because that's basically what this movie is all about. The surprisingly good acting, makeup and digital effects make up for the fact that there really isn't much of a plot. While you can pretty much guess who's gonna live till the end, there are some very suspenseful moments that keep you on the edge of your seat. Once the snakes are released, you keep thinking that at some point the action will die down or at least pause, but it just keeps getting more and more intense. In addition, the passenger aircraft guarantees there will be a good mix of personalities among the people which makes the movie more entertaining. Overall, if you don't mind a bit of gore and love getting goosebumps, I recommend this movie.",Snakes on a Plane
413,mb_webguy,I saw *beep* Snakes on a *beep* Plane,7,21 August 2006,"Unlike Samuel L. Jackson, I did not get tired of those *beep* snakes on the *beep* plane. Action, snakes, some boobies, more snakes, decent acting (no, really!), and the most plot you should reasonably expect from this part of the movie. There aren't any glaring plot holes, but when the plot's that thin, it's easier to spot the holes before it hits theaters.My only two gripes were that the third act was a bit slow and predictable. First, it would have been much more interesting to see them crash the plane in the Hollywood hills, letting those exotic snakes loose on the two-legged snakes of LA. The way the plane was brought in was so cliché that even giving the audience the nod to let us know that they know that it's a cliché, still wasn't enough to make it interesting.My second gripe is minor but it came at a point of the movie that I was already starting to let my interest slip the least bit. My question is simple.... Didn't the producers of this movie see that episode of Mythbusters where they tested explosive decompression? You get a big boom, a bit of a breeze, then nothing as the cabin pressure becomes equal to the outside air pressure. But to have a five-minute sequence with air rushing from a 4 cu.meter cockpit and first-class section? Exactly where is all of that air coming from? And yet I can't really hold these few things against them, any more than I could fault ""Night of the Comet"" for having powered life support monitors after all of the rest of the power (including for the life support equipment) was turned off... SoaP is a good, campy B action movie, and that's all it tries to be. And if that's all you're expecting of it, you should enjoy it as much as I did.",Snakes on a Plane

Jackson really hit it on the money when he decided to take this role because if he didn't then nobody else would have. it is a pure Samuel Jackson role of a tough guy cop who saves everyone from an unreal situation that nobody else would have gotten near. Snakes make me excited and grossed out at the same time. There is a scene where a snake bites a girl in the breast and a man in the penis and I couldn't help but just laugh and then fell disgusted at the same time.I overall fell that snakes earned a perfect score on the rating board because it is about motherfu**** snakes on a motherfu**** plane and whenever there is another movie like that I will be sure to review it and compare it.

Or characterisation, I hope, because the plane is stuffed full of clichés - the hostess on her last flight, the young couple wanting to join the mile high club, the arrogant rap star and his overweight bodyguards, a woman with a baby, the bad ass FBI agent and his reluctant star witness...What the film does offer is lots of laughs (some of them intentional), lots of snakes (some of them dodgy CG), and lots of gory deaths by snake bite.

I'll list just a few of the aspects that annoyed me most. First, it was overlong- there should have been a lot more celluloid on the cutting room floor. Second, the science is largely wrong. Snakes do not attack people that way; real aircraft are not built to allow animals to get up to the cabin or cockpit as easily as these snakes did; commercial planes flying at altitude (20000+ ft) do not decompress that way- you get immediate fog and ice and everyone suffers terrible head pains from pressure differentials- and then there're the affects of hypoxia which were largely ignored in this film. Planes don't go up by pulling back on the stick. You need to increase power to go up. Planes also have structural limits to dive velocities. You can't just push the stick down and go as fast as you want. Above certain speeds the plane could have severe structural damage. All this was very distracting and annoying for me. Maybe the movie should have been made as a comedy- perhaps then these issues would have been tolerable. I know my opinion is in the minority here.

Well transporting a witness on a plane to Los Angeles the criminal who the witness is supposed to testify against smuggles crates of deadly poisonous snakes on to the plane to kill the witness. All hell ensues. Samuel L Jackson plays the cop transporting the witness who has to keep things under control.This movie is incredibly entertaining, keeping us in our seats with tension as the snakes mount their attack on the unsuspecting passengers. The snake attack scenes are all brutal, bloody and scary. No victim gets off easy.Well the movie does mainly come off as scary there are plenty of funny moments.But when all is said and done Snakes on a Plane comes off as one thing above all. Entertaining. It is incredibly entertaining. It won't win any awards and it won't be highly praised. It will get mediocre reviews and might win the MTV Movie Awards(which doesn't say much) but in the end it will be the fact that you could watch it over and over again and always enjoy it and be entertained that is the kind of movie it will be seen as.That and a movie with snakes on a plane!!!!

Of course, there will always be those who truly feel a film deserves a 10, and to each there own. But I believe the only reason this has a cumulative score of 8+, after 14,000 votes, is because the mainstream moviegoer won't ever go see a film about snakes, much less one with this title.

Or possibly the fact that it has Samuel L Jackson in the lead? Probably both. I've now seen this film twice & enjoyed it more the second time, perhaps the title the first time around was a tad ridiculous. The reason this film is quite respectable is due to it's non stop action & it's simplicity. It actually seems possible that this could happen with snakes slithering through the nooks & crannies of an aircraft & how once the pilot is effected then all hell breaks loose no matter what the situation. You want to know what each snake is capable of & are keen to see who the next victim might be. Strange? Yes, Stupid?

My friend told me about this film, about the stupid premise (which is actually quite ingenious) and that it would be awful. Once the internet buzz started, however, I was hooked, and saw it on an opening weekend. The crowd was really into it, the director David Ellis hit all the high notes, the secondary characters were well developed, I even got into the cheesy Trevor Rabin Score. And as for secondary music, all of the songs were actually written for the film! What a concept! The snake effects were all done extremely well. My wife was squirming in the seat! Samuel L.

This movie lives up to everything it says it is and more, it's not trying to be a masterpiece type film with a super secret message behind it that some people have grown fond of, it is simply created to deliver an enjoyable movie theater experience, and that it does. When I was a boy, I grew up watching classics like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Grease, we didn't have no Snakes on a Plane. This movie has stuff for all audiences, it has side-splitting comedy of Snakes on a Plane, and it also has serious, emotional struggles of people on a plane, trying to deal with the enormous pressure of poisonous snakes on crack. What we're missing from the new suspense movies coming out these days is escalating suspense, rather than the hollywoodish ""boo-aha"" cheap-shots that we see so much in current thrillers. This movie takes us back to the good times when it was okay to go ten minutes without having some monster pop out of the corner, and to have escalating suspense in which we felt for the character's sanctity. And this movie still had room for cheap-shot ""boo-aha"" scenes with snakes jumping out of crevices on a plane.Warning: If you are offended by dead babies, do not see this film.",Snakes on a Plane

Mainstream movies nowadays (for the most part) have lost that spark...until now.Title the genre what you like, Snakes On A Plane is entertaining. Samuel L. Jackson's performance hits the nail right on the head as Detective Flynn of the FBI. Flynn is sent on a mission to transport some guy (honestly i can't find him anywhere on IMDb) to L.A. from Hawaii to testify against an Asian killer man. The Asian killer man says, ""Well governor, we must kill some guy. Let's...uh...put snakes on his plane!!"" And thus the movie moves foreword. I laughed more than I've laughed in months...it was breathtaking to see Samuel L. saying lines that sounded almost exactly like the ""Say What Again..."" line from Pulp Fiction. The movie overall is pretty fun anyways.To sum it up, a movie's purpose is to entertain, and boy was I entertained. I'm thinking a sequel titled...""Poison Dart Frogs On A Speed Boat!!""",Snakes on a Plane
426,crimsonotter,If watching a snake hump a lai doesn't make you laugh....,8,3 September 2006,"I hadn't been caught up in the ""Blair Witch"" style hype I now understand surrounded this film. The first I saw was a quick preview on TV and my reaction was ""what is Sam thinking about?"" and promptly went back to whatever it was that I was doing. But, I looked it up on IMDb and saw a comment from a guy who'd seen a preview at the threatre he worked at and absolutely flipped....so, given it started the next day in our little country cinema, I thought'd I'd fork out the ten bucks and see how good this thing might be. And yes, it lives up to the simple set of expectations I was given. Namely: 1) Don't go if you're a woman, 2) Don't bring a woman. 3) Don't bring a sense of realism. 4) Have a sense of humour.Too many movies take themselves too seriously - this movie is at the other end of the spectrum. It clearly was developed from the start as pure escapism entertainment. You're not going to have a better understanding of humanity or yourself at the end of this movie. You will laugh out loud, you will cheer for Sam, and you'll love most of the characters (the one's that make it that is). If they could have had John Travolta come out of the toilet with his long black hair and his pulp fiction novel, with that ""what's going on here"" expression it would have been perfect.That said, I thought that there was a surprising amount of character development during this, they even took the time to break a few stereotypes...If you need to relax from all the fear and pressure the media and the government is heaping on you, go and get some pop corn a Coke and enjoy this movie....it will be a great investment of an hour and a half of your life....perhaps I do have a better understanding of myself after seeing it...who knows.",Snakes on a Plane

It is 1 hour 35 minutes of corny action and ridiculous plot and it STAYS good that way. All of you and the critics who say this movie has a predictable plot and stuff...get this... IT IS MEANT TO BE THAT WAY. Seriously don't take it seriously!!!!!! This movie is for fun and simple entertainment. Its not a thriller or anything. I thought it was a damn good movie and lived up fully to my expectations. Also, this movie has a lot of corny lines in it and come on they make you laugh. The classic example is Samuel L Jackson when he says ""Thats it! I have had it with these mother%^&$%*# snakes on this mother#@%^@#$ plane!""To summarize it all if your looking for some simple action movie with lots of corny lines and one actor who is most suitable for these kind of movies then this is the movie for you.",Snakes on a Plane

Terrible castingThe list could go on for ever, but the truth of the matter is that Snakes On A Plane is so bad that it is entertaining! This farcical film never takes itself too seriously (I hope) which means you find yourself laughing through it, whether you are meant to be or not!The film is just good fun. If you are expecting and hoping for a serious action movie do not see this film!

429,bosna_,"Horror? Embarrassing comedy, if you ask me.",1,30 December 2006,"!!!!! CONTAINS SPOILERS !!!!!The movie launches with the standard Hollywood movie-template: Bad guy shows up on screen, good guy sees bad guy kill another guy, and the hunt has begun.What this movie differs from the template is that instead of letting the bad guy chase the good guy, the bad guy lets a horde of ""snakes"" do the chase. I write in quotes, because the snakes are all CGI. *Real* bad ones as well, because are we really supposed to believe a snake moves as it does in the movie? Or that it has got the ""thermal vision""? Or the super intelligence required to flank sneak towards the enemy before making the final blow with its fangs?As with any other movie with an overloaded amount of CGI, the quality drops way below zero. Reality is not computer generated. And to the makers of the snakes-CGI in this movie I want to say that you should really join the train of video game making instead, you would make a fortune! Oh, the end of the movie. The passengers got saved, hooray! But what about the bad guy that we were introduced to? Where did he go? Also, the doc told us in the middle of the movie that anti-venom from one kind of snake bite CANNOT be used for another kind of bite, so how on earth are the doctors supposed to know *exactly* which kind of snake bit which person?

The movie wasn't even so bad it was good; it was as lifeless as a snake-bite victim. Samual L. Jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame. It reminded me of one of those cheesy SciFi movies, except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy. It all seemed worn, flat, and overtly formulaic. I'm shocked to say I actually think Anaconda was more fun. It's easy to understand that SOAP realizes it's a piece of s*it and plays along with it, but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense. It's the worst kind of lame movie: it's joyless.",Snakes on a Plane

I have never ever been to a movie where the entire theater gave it a standing ovation at the end or even cheered during parts. This movie is a definite crowd pleaser.

Snakes is all of these things and much, much more. It's also wonderfully entertaining and in a summer of films that felt like they went on forever, Snakes is that rare beast a feature film that doesn't for one moment outstay it's welcome.And boy can Sam Jackson pick 'em. For a moment, just a moment, he looked like he was loosing his way. Picking films that were either rubbish or uncool.

435,catbunwars,Entertaining and unexpected: I loved it,10,17 September 2006,"It's official: Samuel L. Jackson is my favorite actor. With this, Pulp Fiction, and countless others combined, Sam has proved himself to be one of the most entertaining actors in Hollywood. Sure, his role in Snakes isn't Oscar material, but who can say that watching him take control of the plane with his usual bad ass attitude isn't a total joy? I'll have to admit, without him this film would have been NOTHING. I would have been writing another negative comment like all the other idiots who gave this two stars or less.The dialouge is cheesy, the snakes don't look in the least bit real, and the character development is so typical and almost identical to any other movie we have seen of this genre. But, it is all these things that make this movie great. Sure, there are plenty of moments in this film that create tension and put you on the edge of your seat, but never do you feel the least bit scared while watching. This isn't a horror movie, it is an action/suspense movie. When I went to see this I wasn't expecting to be scared, I was expecting to guess which person was going to die next. This movie is supposed to make you laugh when people die who we care nothing about. This movie isn't meant to be taken seriously.All you fools out there who said this movie is ridiculous and amateurish are missing the entire point. Look at the title for Christ's sake! ""Snakes on A Plane"". How serious of a movie do you think this is supposed to be? It's just fun. Mindless fun where we don't have to worry about plot.

Samuel L.Jackson deserves the biggest round of applause for his performance although he was'not always focused on but his one liners were unbelievable and to tell you the truth a bit motivating when you see a few snakes getting their ass kicked. everyone did their part in this movie with a satisfactory ending.and the snakes were amazing which really gets you off your seat. unbelievable.

The only value this movie has is entertainment value. I am sure that this movie is better in a crowded theater with people screaming every time a snake bites a woman's tit, but who cares? This movie was not made to make you think about anything, this movie was made to aesthetically please you, and it should. If you don't get some superficial, old fashioned fun out of this movie then I feel bad for you, because this movie was the single greatest movie going experienced of my entire life.

439,mathmission,Attitude is all it takes!,7,18 August 2006,"I'm not even sure how to start this review. So, I'll start by saying this: Once upon a time, there was a man named Samuel L. Jackson, and he grew up to be a bad*ss.And that's what this film is: a following of one of the most well known attitudes in Hollywood. Snakes on a Plane is about an assassination attempt at 30,000 feet. To touch a little on the story: a young man witnesses a brutal murder by a L.A. mafia boss, and is needed to testify. He witnesses this murder in Hawaii, and is needed in court in LA. This means, of course, that he has to be flown. This mafia boss, however, takes action against him, and loads the planes cargo bay with a huge box of snakes. By adding a pheromone to flowers on board, he is able to make the snake hyper-aggressive. And what do we have here: Snakes on a Plane.But it's not the story that carries this film as far is it has reached so far. It's not the marketing, or the absurdity that has promoted it beyond most films this summer. It is the sole fact that Samuel L. Jackson signed on, and made such a horrible film out of humor and hilarity.One thing that made this experience so enjoyable for meand that's what it truly was, an experiencewas the audience. Our theater was packed with people who had waited to see this film, and were dedicated enough to see it on its sneak peak run, Thursday night at 10PM, the night before opening day. It was a constant cluster of shouting, laughing, and cheering. When Samuel L. Jackson appeared for the first time on screen, the crowd went nuts, and when he said his already famous linewhich I'm sure will live on foreverpopcorn flew into the air as the audience clapped, cheered and laughed.Let me be honest and critical for a moment. As a horror film, this was pretty weak. The CG was par, if that. Even Anaconda had better computer graphics to animate the movement of snakes. The characters were shallow, and cardboard, and their lines were just flat out terrible. Strangely enough, there was some creativity that came from the camera, and its movement. Outside of that, though, this film would never stand alone just as so many failed horror films have. Its sometime ridiculous gore drew laughs, and really, a guy getting bit in the nuts while going to the bathroom: who wouldn't just bust a gut? It's meant to be this bad, and strangely, it'll make things that much better! But as I said, it's not the cult following that this film will generate, it's not the bad lines, and the campy graphics, it's not when the little dog is fed to the python, and it's not when the lovers in the bathroom are bitten on almost every form of genitals possible, that make this film such a fun watch.For me, this is what I felt it was: Hollywood has produced some crap over the years, both in terms of writing, and in acting. When this script was picked up by Samuel Jackson, we all knew that this was something more than just another bad movie. For me, it's somewhat of a statement: there are bad movies out there, and there are actors and actresses willing to admit that they exist. But not only that: they're willing to make fun of that fact, and enjoy it at the same time. Jackson actually hasn't even seen the entire film all the way through! And the producers actually made a phone service where you can have Jackson call you, stating that you MUST see this film, as ""it just might be the best motion picture of this year!"" Without the crowd, and the attitude going into this film, there are going to be viewing problems. But who knows, you might enjoy it just as much as I did, even without the crowd. There's nothing better than going into a film you know is bad, and be able to shout things at the screen collectively with 500 other people. We all walked out of that film feeling somewhat closer to all the strangers, as if we'd all experienced a train wreck together, and we had bonded over the past 90 minutes.It's a terrible, great, crappy, wonderful, campy, hilarious, action-packed summer flick that'll gross more money than serious films such as Lady in the Water! Go see this on opening night if you can! Otherwise, be ready to drink before hand, get a ride there, and enjoy what you can! And if you're still drunk, get a ride home as well! We don't want an epitaph that reads ""His/Her last action on earth was watching Snakes on a Mutha-F*%kin Plane!""",Snakes on a Plane
440,BloodyHellSunday,Total unrealistic Crap,1,4 February 2010,"I was really looking forward to this film, because I heard so much about it and enjoyed the hype around it.What I saw then was total crap... the snakes are ridiculously unrealistic, they acted more like aliens than real snakes, really... and it was so obvious that they're computer-animated, that ruined the whole fun.Some scenes which sure wanted to be creepy or terrifying really made me laugh...snakes biting people in the eyes, the tongue or even in boobs...ridiculous.

443,planeblaine,Absurdly ridiculous,2,3 September 2007,"This movie starts out pretty good with great scenery and a decent story. Then it goes flying and becomes the most absurd and truly ridiculous film I have ever seen. Anyone that has flown, ever seen a plane fly, or had friends go flying will realize just how little of this move is even plausible. Just look at the goofs and trivia sections here on IMDb and you'll get a taste of what I mean. I don't know of many other films that have amassed so much goof material in such a short time in public. And I guarantee there are many more scenes/occurrences in the movie worthy of entry to the goof list. I would add them myself but I haven't a large enough notepad nor the 4 hours it would take to enter them all onto the website.I don't want to just flame on the movie, I did watch the whole thing. But I am easily entertained. I knew nothing of it, saw no trailers or heard no hype, it just came on the HBO channel I was watching. I am amazed that Samuel L Jackson did this film, it is so bad. As usual, he is very good for the most part, but doesn't really bring the film back to believability. I just read some IMDb comments that it was tongue in cheek humor, but it doesn't come across that way. Mel Brooks, the Farrelly brothers (or similar) could have a lot of material in spoofing this one. It's just a dumb movie with no close proximity to reality whatsoever. It combines and capitalizes on people's fear of flying, fear of snakes and of being stuck in an airplane at the same time.Literally, every single thing that happens on that ridiculously inaccurate airplane is impossible and bogus. They might as well have had the main character wake up from a deep sleep at the end and say, ""gosh that sure was a weird dream"". It would at least address the implausibility of all that occurred.",Snakes on a Plane

Unfortunately the people who have voted before me (almost all 10.6k of them) are liars. The movie does not rate a 8.6 or whatever it has at this point. It was bad, but it was so bad it is a must see movie. I have never seen a B movie with such polish or talent. If you have 2 hours to kill and you are not likely to walk out of the theater because it sucks, then you should see it. If there was a sequel I wouldn't bother seeing it at the theaters, but shamefully I will end up watching it.It would have been a tad better if the audio was dubbed over and out of sync with the mafia characters as they spoke, but you can't have everything.",Snakes on a Plane

They're not serious ones, but any person who's likely to get any enjoyment whatsoever out of this miserable excuse of a movie, will surely regard them as spoilers, because apart from them, this movie has nothing to offer. Here goes.There are a couple of things you can learn from this film.1. At the first opportunity, an angry horde of poisonous snakes will fiercely attack the electrical wires on a plane, causing critical malfunction to the equipment.2. When they're done with the wires, they will relentlessly bite at everybody's genitalia. They can't help it, it's just in their nature.That about sums it all up. After more than one hour the movie still couldn't decide whether it wanted to be action, thriller, drama, or teenage horror parody, but kept on blundering between all of these and more, and the snakes just kept on pouring in from all directions. At that point I finally came to my senses and went read a book instead. PLEASE do yourself a major favor and do it earlier.",Snakes on a Plane

Samuel Jackson was gloriously over the top. His performance alone is worth the price of admission. If you want some scares, to be grossed out a little bit, and to have some laughs as well, then this is the movie for you.

447,theduece,Why We Go To the Movies (Minor Spoilers),8,19 August 2006,"Snakes On A Plane reminds us of two things. 1) What happens when seemingly ""bad"" ideas come into being on the big screen. 2) How a bad idea can be played out as one the best B-Movies in the past decade or so. Snakes On A Plane (SOAP from now on) had to be one of the best experiences I have had a movie in recent years. I'm not talking about the drama (there is none), or the horror (It's so hokey it's funny, but I'm sure that was the point). I'm talking about the whole experience, even the crowd was great. When Samuel L. Jackson said what will be his most infamous line, the entire crowd stood up and cheered for about 10seconds...and it wasn't distracting, it actually enhanced the movie. They even cheered when he came onto the screen. There were at least 12 times when the entire broke out with laughter and applause. The entire film is based around the idea of ""How can we make something so ridiculous that people will just have to love it and laugh?"". Well the movie succeeds in every way possible. It keeps you constantly entertained for the full 105 minutes. From the first attack on the obligatory Mile-High club couple, to the numerous attacks (and some that are rather inventive) on the rest of the nameless passengers, the film never lets up on the laughs or the enjoyment. It has a really clichéd plot and recycled characters but you don't need the in depth nature that films Like Gangs of New York has...it is definitely not screaming for an Oscar. Jackson owns every single scene he is even partially visible in, each of his lines...pure B-Movie magic. If you want a good time, and if you have 2 hours to kill go down to the theater and check it out, you won't regret it.I give 8 out of 10 for being one the best times at a movie I've had at a theater in a long while. Hopefully your crowd will be as great as mine.",Snakes on a Plane

This is just a proof that when many people gather up and make something really special and amazing, even before they know what they are really talking about, their believes and commitment to it, is so strong that no one is really seeing it for what it is: Absolutely NOTHING! Who wants to be the one to say that something is bad, when several million people are shouting out how great it is! Well... I will! Not that anyone, who is caught up in this hype, will listen, since everybody have to say that this movie is great, just to defend the fact that they have praised it before they have even seen it! That would just prove the fact that the media and the internet have a strong hold on them! For those who still have a mind of their own: This movie is a waste of time! It really sucks and this review comes from a person who loves this kind of movies! I don't always need a great story and super effects, but I do have standards!

But the film is Hilarious Samuel L Jackson is so funny, the way he delivers his lines need to be seen. I found when i watched the film is that it is quite a lot like Scream in the way that its quite serious acting but its just totally stupid. and i think its gets stupider and stupider as the film goes along which makes me think that the people involved in the film felt they were making a serious but then realised...

450,Pas2leo53,Amazing--If you're into this kind of stuff,10,18 August 2006,"This has been possibly one of the most hyped up movies in history and, in my opinion, it gave us everything that it was supposed to give. There were snakes. They were on a plane. People die in awesomely gruesome ways. I don't know how much more you could ask for in a movie titled ""Snakes on a Plane."" Plus, it has possibly one of the most memorable lines in any movie ever. If you don't know which line I'm referring to, go see the movie, and you'll know as soon as the line is uttered.Aside from those aspects, though, I do believe that there were some great performances, including Samuel Jackson. He was absolutely perfect for the role of Agent Flynn. I also believe that the plot was pretty interesting, with a witness to a brutal murder trying to make it to L.A. from Hawaii in order to testify against a despicable gangster, Eddie Kim (not a spoiler, you find out in the first 10 minutes). In one of the most creative assassination plans ever, Kim releases hundreds of deadly snakes on the plane in order to kill the witness, and from there, all hell breaks lose. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes action/horror movies and is not squeamish. It truly earns its ""R"" rating, and I couldn't be happier about it.",Snakes on a Plane

The only reason this gets 9 instead of 10 is that the group you see it with is somewhat important to your enjoyment.

The real fact is that the filmmakers KNOW it's corny as a horror film and so they play with it. The funny B-Grade bits are hilarious and the more serious parts are well acted, giving the film the bit of seriousness it needed to make the audience enjoy the film. I HIGHLY enjoyed this film and I hope that you will too. Anyone who gives this movie LESS than a 10 is insane. It was great and if you go into it with an open mind, you'll love it too. :) It was certainly a better film than Snakes on a Train...even if that movie was hilarious too. :P",Snakes on a Plane

It begins on a upbeat note with reggae music playing and nice shots of a Hawiian island. When the snakes are released later on, the fun begins! there is hardly a time when you are not grinning ear to ear! The thing that works about SOaP is that it balances thrills with tongue and cheek lines! Samueal L. Jackson is great as the tough, snake killing FBI agent Neville Flynn! He manages to seem hard and determined, but likable. The attacks by the snakes are truly fun to watch! they pop out of the most unexpected times and are generally gory! The only downside is that there are so much product placement. I don't want to say anymore lest I ruin some of the fun! But I urge you to go see Snakes on a Plane!",Snakes on a Plane

Samuel just lost it acting such a movie.. it doesn't deserve a 7.6 (4)its by max a b grade quality movie and doesn't deserve more than a 3.

I usually go to a more popular one with 20, but that gets crowded on Friday nights (good luck getting in on opening night for the most talked-about movie pre-release). There were about 50 people in the theater, and most were under 25. There was an elderly woman there who laughed when a snake slithered in on a rather raunchy scene and bit a woman on the breast. The scariest scene was when a snake jumped right to the camera. When Jackson's famous line was delivered, we clapped. It was a very fun movie experience.The movie was excellent, almost everyone agrees (except for the critics). It was frightening and funny, and there couldn't have been a better choice than Samuel L. Jackson. I want everyone to know that this is much more than a campy ""B-movie"". This is a movie-making masterpiece, and a rare movie that everyone (yes, I said everyone) will like.

Other than that, it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes. All of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie. Now that the movie has actually come out, hopefully this joke will die. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash.

460,strangla35,Just sit back and enjoy yourself.,8,18 August 2006,"I just saw the 10:01 PM opening of SoaP last night. Okay, where do I start? The ""plot"" is that this guy living in Hawaii has witnessed a brutal murder by a crime lord, and now he's going to LA to testify against him, in the protective custody of none other than Samuel L. Jackson. Oh, and somebody has left them a little surprise on board the plane.I think you can guess what it is.Could I have devised this plot in five minutes, while groggy and half-asleep? Yes, I'm sure I could have. Was this movie stupid? Yes, it was. Was it one of Samuel L. Jackson's deeper movies? Not in the least. Was it entertaining and enjoyable? Oh yes. It most certainly was.Sure, this movie has all the old and played-out situations: a horny couple ravaging each other in a restroom, just before they become two of the snakes unfortunate victims (of course, not before we see some lusty camera footage.) Then there's the complete jerk, the selfish guy who cares only about his own skin, the one who we just want to get his just desserts. And let's not forget the guy who goes crazy out of his own fear and endangers everybody else. You'll recognize all these character stereotypes and plot situations as soon as you see them. It's all been done before.But you know what? That doesn't matter! This movie isn't supposed to be deep, original or thought-provoking! If you got to this movie expecting any of those things, you're an idiot. If, on the other hand, you go to these movie just to have fun, see some cool CGI snakes (and to see said snakes wreak havoc on scores of innocent people), then my friend, you've come to the right place.This movie never gets boring. The multi-colored venomous snakes are everywhere on the plane, and they're pi**ed. Samuel L. Jackson is great, as always, delivering fine acting, disposing of snakes in a variety of creative ways, oh yeah, and dropping f-bombs. Other people are busy running about like decapitated chickens as they get bitten in the most delicate of places before frothing at the mouth and dropping dead. Seriously, this movie stomps some major a**.I saw this movie with my parents (mistake), and they were grumbling and groaning about how bad it was, it sucked, it was horrible, blah blah blah. I think their problem was that they didn't know exactly what kind of a movie they were seeing, and they expected too much from it. I, on the other hand, knew exactly what I was in for before we went to the theater. This was one of the few times where me and my parents were divided by polar opposite opinions about a movie.Like I said, if you go to this movie expecting it to be deep or thought provoking, you WILL be disappointed. DO NOT go to this movie if you're in a serious mood of any sort. If you go to this movie just to sit back and have fun, you will have a blast.

That being said, Yes, it is a very exciting movie that never slows down. You will jump, laugh, and be freaked out at snakes through the whole movie. Sam Jackson's most memorable performance since Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and when he was in that one part in Coming To America, but thats not to say SNAKES ON A PLANE is better then those movies. All the other actors were okay, some though just over acted. But being that no one really cares about any of the other characters besides Sam Jackson's the other acting problems are really over looked.People, the movie did add up to all WOW it built up. So see this movie. It will always be remembered, both as an awesome movie and easily the most creative movie in years or ever.

In fact, the phrase ""seeing a movie"" doesn't even begin to describe the experience. You're not ""seeing a movie,"" you're getting shot point blank in the face with pure entertainment. There should be a Surgeon General's warning that if you see this movie while pregnant, your child will come straight out of the womb and kick somebody's ass. I could tell from the opening credits that I was in for something special, but as soon as I saw a snake bite a woman on her exposed nipple, I knew that seeing this movie was the best decision I had ever made in my entire life. They might as well not even have the Oscars this year, because no sane mind could imagine any movie beating out this one in any category. Best Comedy? Snakes on a Plane. Best Drama? Snakes on a Plane. Best Action Movie? Snakes on a Plane. Best Thing That's Ever Happened in the History of Planet Earth? Snakes on a Plane. If you're a producer or director of another movie that came out this year, let me be the first to say I'm sorry you wasted your time.In all seriousness though, Snakes on a Plane will more than likely never win anything or even be mentioned on any awards show (with the possible exception of the MTV Movie Awards). But for all of the people out there rolling their eyes and muttering to themselves that this movie is baseless trash, just give me a second to explain to you why you are stupid. This movie was never intended to impress anybody. It wasn't created to earn the all-holy praises of the infinitely wise movie snobs that give out Academy Awards. It's not about the evolution of a budding relationship between two former strangers lost in the sea of life. It's not about influencing people through couched political undertones or insightful symbolism relating to man's role in the universe. It's about motherf**kin' snakes on a motherf**kin' plane. That's it. Yes, the plot is completely absurd. Yes, the dialogue is cornier than Orville Redenbacher. And yes, there is excessive gore and gratuitous nudity. But if you suspend your pre-conceived notions of good taste for an hour and forty minutes or so, you might realize that this movie is exactly what it set out to be, and it can be quite entertaining if you let it.In summary, if you want to watch some pseudo-intellectual drivel that you can talk about at your next beatnik cocktail party, there is plenty of snooty self-important crap out there for you. But if you're NOT a total douchebag, and you're someone that just wants to have an entertaining experience at the movies without impressing everyone around you with your vastly superior intellect, then you should definitely give this film a chance.",Snakes on a Plane

Admittedly I thought the same thing but I was pleasantly surprised.The story is simple, but it works for the type of film it is. A young man is witnesses the murder committed by a notorious drug boss. He escapes the clutches of the boss; and must take a plane to testify against the boss. Asps, boas and every evil snake you can think of is put on his flight Flynn (Jackson) must save the day or plane.Pretty simple but enjoyable. Don't rent/buy this movie expecting ""The Usual Suspects"" or ""The Bourne Ultimatum"". Instead rent/buy it expecting a fun movie. It is guaranteed to have you going ""ooo"" or ""aaa"" as you see the unfortunate victims of the snakes. I would recommend it for a lazy Saturday night in, with friends or family (although if you have siblings under 13 it may frighten them).IN SHORT: An entertaining ride. Though it is not Jackson's bets film, it is entertaining. When he says the infamous line ""I've had it with these mother****in' snakes! On this mother****in' plane!"" You will laugh or at least smile. It will provide you laughs as you see those around you jump back in surprise as a snake appears out of nowhere.7.5/10",Snakes on a Plane

I have recently made myself sit down with the DVD and watch it thoroughly and I have to go with original feelings on this. Did the producers, in some odd way want this to be funny? There are so many stupid things in this movie that would never happen. Oh, and the acting is HORRIBLE. Sam is usually ""the man,"" but not in this one. This movie sucked, from the awful acting of the prosecutor's killer in the beginning to the fake as hell landing of the airplane in the end. And why would someone intentionally shoot out the windows of an airplane? All od the other negative comments (which I have read) in the SOAP comments area are true!!

469,Paul_Deane,Snakes on a Mother F-in Plane,5,5 April 2007,"Snakes on a Plane (2006) is a movie of firsts. It marks the first movie driven to commercial success by the internet, so in respects, Snakes is a landmark film, paving the way for upcoming features fueled by the likes of YouTube.com and online trailer sites (note: the success of 300, for example). It is the fist movie I have been intrigued by solely because of the title. I have to admit that I approached this movie with a rare excitement, understanding that S.o.a.P. admits its tawdry style, so it can be viewed almost as homage to stylish thrillers by mimicking and paying tribute to them, rather than actually becoming one. I was mistaken. The result, another first: Snakes may wind up to be the first cult film with no following.The movie is problematic from the start as the long ""Lovely Day"" title sequence creates a misleading mood for the film, especially when the following scene involves a human piñata. From here, the ""plot"" (in quotes because it is simply used as a device to get us to the plane faster) unfolds as Sean (Nathan Phillips), the sole witness to a murder, reluctantly joins FBI Agent Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson), who convinces him to testify against the brutal murderer Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson). No prosecuting witness has ever survived long enough to testify against Kim, so we can imagine how high the stakes are. To get to trail, Sean and Flynn must travel from Honolulu to Kim's hometown of L.A. on Pacific Air's Flight 121; a plane Kim has filled with the world most deadly vicious snakes in order to kill Sean.The plane itself is filled with an array of personalities, each stereotypical and more of a caricature than a character. The black men are either rappers or tough guys, the white men are nerdy and uptight, the young women are sexual with no inhibitions, and the old women are helpless victims. There is a flamboyant steward, a few small children, a woman drinking whiskey from her metal flask (post 9-11 security?) and of course Samuel L. Jackson, whose presence alone allows the movie to be, I don't want to say worth watching, but most definitely entertaining. Nearly everyone on the plane is overtly rude and self-centered, able only to say exactly what is on their mind at the exact moment they are speaking (take the woman who was coarsely treated, as she says to her dog in response to her assailant, ""Don't worry Mary-Kate, his hair plugs won't hurt you."") Because we don't care about the characters, we don't mind seeing them die at the jaws of fierce snakes. We are introduced to snake vision, akin to the sight of Predator (1987), as the snakes make their way from the cargo area to the bathrooms (and I thought Jackass 2 would be the only movie of 2006 where a man gets his penis bitten by a snake), and steadily make their way down aisles, through overhead compartments, into circuit breakers (a scene which was reminiscent of Jurassic Park (1993), still the go-to movie on reptiles gone wrong), and into the cockpit. The snakes are unprejudiced in their assault, gnashing at peoples eyes, necks, arms, backs, legs and tongues and although it appears as though the movie sounds chilling or gory, the obviously computer animated snakes do not lend themselves well to atmosphere created in the film, thus alleviating any terror or suspense.The real excitement comes when Samuel L. Jackson's tyranny of evil is released on the snakes, killing them by whatever means possible. Some of the weapons include a taser gun, a hand gun, an ax, a fire extinguisher, a microwave, a blowtorch and yes, a harpoon (why am I not so worried about the whiskey flask anymore). And then, the infamous line: ""Enough is enough! I have had it with these mother f_cking snakes on this mother f_cking plane!"" Oh, Samuel L.Snakes on a Plane is not a bad movie, per say. It is entertaining but offers no insight or groundbreaking cinema, aside from its title. But that defines the problem: the intrigue is found simply in the title. Take the name away and the movie would be exposed for what it is: a cheesy action thriller powered by unworthy internet hype. S.o.a.P aside, I am still looking forward to Jackson's other snake themed film, Black Snake Moan (2007).",Snakes on a Plane

They suggested that this was a big dropoff and maybe something was not quite kosher about the ratings (maybe a bunch of phony 10 our 10 votes were cast).So I looked at the other top box office movies for Friday and for the whole year to see how they did (from a website called ""The Numbers""). Here are their ratios in terms of what % of the voters gave it 10 and what % gave it 9. ""Snakes"" is very unusual, with the 10% being about 7 times higher than the 9%.

So ""Snakes"" is unusual. I am not sure if it statistically significant, though. But it would not surprise me.Also, I found the rating given to each of these movies by the ""top 1000 voters."" I guess those are the people who vote the most. The top 1000 only gave ""Snakes"" a 5.9. That dropoff of 2.0 is large, but not the largest. But given that 7.9 is normally a very good rating, and 5.9 not too good, it is interesting. Below are how these movies did overall and then with the top 1000 voters. The number in parantheses is how many votes. Notice that ""Little Miss Sunshine"" also drops off quite a bit (and also had a high 10% to 9% ratio, better than 5 to 1).

475,Glandros,I'm NOT tired of the mothaf***** snakes on this mothaf***** plane!,7,18 August 2006,"Let's face it, the film needs no introduction. It's been the most publicized movie this year, and if you haven't heard of it by now, you've probably been living under a rock.The premise is simple. It's incredibly simple. It's about snakes on a plane. Really. To be more specific, deadly snakes are released on a plane to kill a man before he can testify in court. And Samuel L. Jackson is there to protect that man, kill snakes, keep the plane flying, save passengers, and over-all just kick ass.The film is directed like a generic horror film. The acting, all except for Sam Jackson, is generic horror movie acting. The plot is incredibly simple and unbelievable. There is no character development. In fact, the movie is bad. BUT, it's intentionally bad.If this movie was anything else, it would have been the worst movie I've ever seen. But the fact is, it's fun. It's a bad movie, but it never tries to be anything more. If it took itself seriously, it would have been terrible. If it had been PG-13, it would have been awful. And if not for Sam Jackson, it would have absolutely sucked.But the movie is exactly what you go to see. It's called 'Snakes on a Plane,' and that's what you get. There are no delusions about it. It's plain, simple, and absolutely great.The film is over-the-top. It has more comedy than horror. It's so bad, it's actually good. And, above all, the film is best described the way they already did. Four simple words: Snakes... On a plane.",Snakes on a Plane

OK, its cheezy OK, it's predictable in places.... ....but instead of some of the rubbish movies dressed up by the over exaggerated hype this movie delivers exactly what it 'says on the tin'. If you are going to watch this movie after reading some of the unfair (bad) reviews thinking it will be rubbish - you will be in for a pleasant surprise.Plot - may seem a little far fetched at first, but post 911 you may think twice.Acting - Little hammy but to be fair, apart from a couple of characters, very good and sound. Exactly how I would react - scream and run!!!Effects - the snakes were so good, the hair on the back of my neck stood up in sheer terror! Snakes scrapping with each other, dark, moody ...perfect horror set with echoes of Alien comes to mind.Overall Film - You have a plane full of snakes and passengers 30,000ft up, there is only so much you can do - if you gave this scenario to all the top directors, crew and cast to come out with their own version of this movie, they couldn't get better than this.What could have been better - A little more black humour would not have gone amiss.",Snakes on a Plane

Never has so much applause and laughter been heard... except for at my house when I first saw the trailer for World Trade Center (seriously, wait a few decades before making fun of tragedies... pearl harbor and passion of the Christ waited... why couldn't the makers of WTC wait?) Snakes on a Plane can't even be considered a bad campy horror movie. When you see it you will know, that the only genre this movie belongs to is camp. No horror was seriously attempted. It's simply the best comedy of the year.

I doubt many are going to see SoaP expecting fine cinema. If you go in with the expectations that this movie is ridiculous then you will like it. There are several scenes where they do exactly what every one in the audience wants (perticularly the first major snake attack in the bathroom) The music is strange. The title sequence was like a 70's sitcom. The plot is horrible and predictable. The acting is actually OK. The worst part was a 30 second scene that they took too seriously where one of the flight attendants died. Its very entertaining and its pretty suspenseful in parts. It makes you want to pick your feet up off the floor sometimes. Its great because it's not pretending to be anything that it is not.,Snakes on a Plane

Jacksonw was the only person who could pull the movie off, well. This was not a good bad movie, but a great action movie. The snakes looked real and it was amazing. The deaths were what made this movie, the guy that bite on his d***, the couple that got taken out while joining the mile high club, the guy who was shallowed by the dinosaur looking snake. It was enjoyable. Seeing this movie with my friends made it so worthwhile. I mean the movie was not disappointing at all. GO SEE SNAKES ON A PLANE.!!!!",Snakes on a Plane

I honestly thought it was going to be absolutely awful and as a horror film it really isn't the fright a minute or the shivers down your spine variety. It is the jump out of your seat variety from time to time however. But much more than this is the fact that this is a very very funny film. In my opinion this could be one of the best comedies to be released this year. Highly unbelievable but a good couple of hours of silliness as the the film, the plot line and the actors don't take themselves too spuriously and are obviously just having fun.Give it a go..It might just surprise you...",Snakes on a Plane

It doesn't pretend to be 'realistic' nor does it resort to jokey-joke bad comedy. It's honest approach to what it is hearkens back to the seventies or very early eighties. Some have compared 'Snakes on a Plane' to the cheese of 'Airport'...true enough, but I found it to be more similar to the first couple of 'Friday the 13ths'(NOT the jokey-joke sequels that came in the mid eighties and beyond). The action is done straight but not serious. The violence is nasty but somehow comical. In short, FUN. Sameul L. Jackson just may be the new Peter Cushing. Mr. Cushing could take almost any script and keep it engaging; whether you took the film seriously or not. Mr. Jackson brings credibility to an incredulous script. Also worth mentioning is pacing. The story is just right; not too rushed and not drawn out. The film editing is appropriate and doesn't suffer from the same choppy rush that most films get these days (Batman Begins, Phantom of the Opera). You can actually SEE what's going on instead of slam cuts changing every 2.5 seconds. The film makers had so mush fun making this film that the end credits are a humorous music video. LOOK MA!

But i will tell you now, this movie was amazingly fun. I don't remember having so much fun at any movie this summer and I've seen movies such as Superman, The Descent(overrated), mission impossible and many others. Snakes on a plane is about just that, Sam Jackson is hilarious and just perfect for the role, the other characters are developed pretty well and there are many humorous parts throughout the movie. Most of the time when some 1 dies you will find your self laughing as well, but not because its bad, but because of the fun you will be having watching this movie. This is one of the most fun movies I've seen in a while, and no it wont win Oscars, but id rather see this than capote. :) Go see this movie!",Snakes on a Plane
484,thepowerofhat,It's gonna be big at parties.,7,19 August 2006,"The fact of the matter is this: Snakes On A Plane is everything it was hyped to be. It's an entertaining, violent, fun film to watch from beginning to end. No amount of lackluster dialogue or half-decent CGI can change the fact that it's one of the funnest movies I've ever seen.What makes the movie fun is difficult to describe. The best I can really say is that the film is full of moments where people in a theatre - crowded or not - will all laugh, yell, joke, and applaud in unison. Hearing people poke fun at the casting of the co-pilot (""whammy!"") is both surprising and acceptable when you see this film. Everyone watching is more than welcome to make noise and laugh at times when the film seems to be attempting a ""serious"" moment. And it's because the film just gives off this constant vibe that says, ""I'm not meant to be taken seriously"".Anyone going into the theatre hoping to see an Oscar-worthy film will be disappointed. Anyone going into the theatre hoping to see something he or she has never seen before, and allowing themselves to be entertained by the film and the people sitting near them, will love the experience. When the movie is released on DVD, I have no doubt that people in high school and college will be playing it at parties, laughing along and just enjoying themselves. It's easily one of the funnest films I've ever seen, and I can't wait to see it again with more friends.Oh. And of course, Samuel L. Jackson dominates the screen. Hearing a crowded theatre applaud every time he simply *enters* the screen is a spectacle worth beholding alone.",Snakes on a Plane

You're in a 200 foot long metal tube flying at 35,000 feet with loads of snakes loose everywhere and Sam Jackson is getting very tired of them. I thought that this film, which wasn't screened for critics, lives up to the hype that has buzzed around it. It's entertaining and delivers, unabashedly what it promises. Snakes, some gore and Sam Jackson. The plot is simple enough. A man is witness to a murder by a crime lord and Jackson is an FBI agent protecting the witness until he can get to LA from Hawaii to testify. Snakes are released on the plane in mid-flight and chaos ensues. I would recommend this film. It's fun, funny and extremely entertaining.

This epically hilarious movie is non-stop action from start to finish with no boring, time-wasting character or plot development. Sam ""Paycheck"" Jackson gives a wonderfully stereotypical performance in which he shows no emotion except contempt for the villain and yells half of his bad-ass lines for no reason. Julianna Marguilles (who is still smoking hot, by the way) adds a credible acting presence to the film while Kenan Thompson provides carefully crafted comic relief. There are brilliant one-liners and gratuitous nudity and violence throughout this picture, making it a boisterous romp through the Valley of Awesomeness, which is snugly nestled between Mount Phenomenal and Kick-Ass Peak. If you like the Evil Dead series then you will thoroughly enjoy the Snakes on a Plane.

From the beginning with the Jack Johnson song to the ending it doesn't let you go. Sure the beginning is just an excuse to get to the plane and the action is intense. The deaths are awesome and the savageness is hilarity mixed with gore. Speaking of hilarity there is cheese spewing from every part of this movie with over the top acting and corny one liners that prove that this is the ultimate B movie. I was not disappointed and the hype was delivered with no problems. I laughed and I had a ball the whole 2 hours that this went on. Oh yeah, as a side note Samuel L. Jackson is can officially take anything and make it even better, to me his role in SOAP is only second to Pulp Fiction and it's a really close second. I really loved this movie and it was the most fun I've had in theaters since Matrix 2 and 3.

I can think of lots of films that would be contenders.

I've not had this much sheer fun at a film screening ever.I suspect that this film's reception is going to be split into two: those who expected high camp B drama and those who didn't.Me? I've been waiting for this film for months; hoping that a film with such a terrible premise, a terrible title and the not terrible Samuel Jackson wouldn't disappoint. It doesn't.We laughed, were shocked and cried all the way through. Let there be no mistake, this film is well directed and well acted. And there are plenty of surprises no matter who you are. The special effects are well executed (though I think the debate on how snakes see things will rage and rage).It's just the premise that harks back to the plots of the 70s disaster greats. (I'd still have SLJ over Steve McQ anytime). Any lovers of 'The Big Bus' will be in their element.I wondered later if my party of friends had been too loud, and disturbed other patrons with our laughter and occasional cheering. This film deserves to spawn many wonderful quotes, but the ""...motherfucking snakes off this motherfucking plane"" deserves to go down in cinema history. It was vindicating however, when we noticed that lots of other people laughed once we'd started the ball rolling.Perhaps we may have been overexcited, but we also wondered who could have seen a woman bitten on the nipple, a man bitten on his penis and not thought that this film had been made with a sense of humour? My bugbear is the obvious solution that neither the plane people or the snake expert presented. (answers on a postcard).

It could be that I went expecting a bad movie and so when it was actually quite good it was surprising! Samuel L. Jackson is definitely within his element as the foul mouthed FBI agent tasked with accompanying a star witness on a ""redeye"" flight from Hawaii to Los Angeles.Obviously, unknown by him or anybody beside the bad guys, there has been a large shipment of poisonous snakes placed on the plane and a small charge has been put on to cause an explosion to release them. It works, and then people start dying.The first victims, as luck and the movie producers would have it, are in restrooms so the vast majority of passengers don't realize there is danger. But when hell breaks loose, ALL hell breaks loose...Of course this movie was targeted to internet users. Blogs for months have tracked the production and according to some reports the producers even took some of their ideas from those bloggers... like the MF laden tirade that Jackson goes on as the movie nears climax.This movie was also fun because the audience was so much into it. In fact, as reported elsewhere, this movie might indeed eventually supplant ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" as the biggest audience participation movie out there.It does, of course, still stand to be seen if this movie will be a one-weekend wonder or if it will have the ""legs"" to slither along for many weeks as a hit. I have no doubt that the video release will probably be a major hit. I'd expect an uncut version to do quite well with the majority of the fans.Yeah.

His tone is somehow serious amidst the stupidity of the film.From start to finish, you know what the film is. It's some snakes on a plane - and this plot doesn't change at all. Events happen, but no matter what, there are snakes on the plane. As such, Snakes is not going to win any Oscars, nor is it going to be acclaimed for its deep messages (that's because there aren't any).Though it may be a B-movie, it is not the new Plan 9 From Outer Space. It's a popcorn thriller. An action film that is just that. You can sit there, watch it and enjoy it.

To tread as skilfully between horror and comedy as it does is an admirable feat. Never taking itself too seriously, but enough for many shocking and graphic deaths from snake bites and well-thought out jump moments - people in the theatre were drawing their legs up onto their seats in reaction which is testament to the kind of atmosphere created.

A few ""I'll be back"" style lines. Plenty of gore and women screaming.Some things that didn't work: Snakes where miraculously stopped by an inflateable dinghy and bags along the way and though they had found their way in ducts etc from the cargo hold, they somehow found it hard to circumvent these obstacles. Snakes seemed to appear in waves in the cockpit and when there where no snakes there, nobody seemed very worried about them turning up again until they left someone in there alone and they copped it. Also the part of the plane between the cockpit and main stairwell seemed impervious to snakes somehow.Snakes On A Plane, as the title may suggest, is a simple gore + action film, nothing much more really.

So many big budget and Indie movies these day try too hard to be something they aren't. They try to push some sort of feeling of ethics, mortality, or a certain emotion or a political agenda. They try to touch you. The only place ""Snakes on a Plane"" touches you is in your gut, because your gonna hurt there from laughing and cheering so hard.

The plot is so utterly ridiculous offers one of the strongest arguments yet that Hollywood movies are indeed made for those with the intelligence of a baboon's scrotum. The idea of some uber-gangster loading a plane with deadly snakes as an effective way of offing a witness is so utterly absurd it makes any of Dr. Evil's schemes complete criminal genius - having said that, the scriptwriter should get some credit for originality - we're unlikely to see this story turn up in anything else. For any who might think I lack a sense of humour, the film was marketed as an action movie, not an action/comedy/horror, and there isn't enough comedy or horror in it to justify the label anyway. We have the obligatory 'blonde chick with over-sized funbags' in a completely unnecessary sex scene getting bitten on the afore mentioned hooter, and a ludicrous 'bloke getting bitten on the knob' gag - both hopelessly out of place in the overall pace of a film supposedly built on and action and tension. The cast did as well as anyone realistically could with the Cleveland-steamer of a script, though they might well wonder why they bothered - especially the likes of Julianna Margulies, fresh from her excellent work on The Sopranos, and Anchorman's David Koechner, who clearly got lost on the studio lot on his way to the the set of another, much funnier film. However,I have to say, I have absolutely no idea what Sam Jackson thought he was doing signing up for something like this. His lines were hammy and clumsily fudged together in one of his poorest performances to date. It's as far away as you can get from Pulp Fiction. Really Sam! You should be ashamed of yourself! If there are any positives, they are the snake CG effects, which are actually pretty good, and there are some interesting/original (albeit highly improbable) deaths. All in all, its a sorry state of affairs if studios are happy to spend millions on festering turds like this at the expense of something that might actually offer a bit of creativity and require the viewer to be conscious while watching. I can't help thinking this was the jettisoned script for Anaconda 3 that some coked-up studio exec found written in faeces on the wall of George Bush's toilet.

I wont give anything away, but suffice it to say that when Sammy L. said, ""I am tired of these Mutha!#*&in Snakes on this Mutha!#*&in Plane!"" the audience lurched forward in laughter, and many said it in unison with Sam... including me, followed by uproarious cheering afterwords. Samuel kicks his speech-spouting role in ""Deep Blue Sea"" up a couple of notches here, and it pops and sizzles like... snakes on a frying pan.If you want to see people attacked in hilariously contrived ways by Snakes, and you don't have a fear of flying, by all means see this movie NOW! And if you DO have a fear of flying... haha, this movie presents such a ridiculous situation that a viewing might just cure you. Give it a shot, like Venom shooting out of your poison sacs... you'll be glad you did.",Snakes on a Plane
504,RedDragonStu,Terrible,1,7 September 2007,"In this world there must be only a few things that could be worse than being stuck on a plane filled with snakes. Unfortunately, one of those things is watching a movie about being stuck on a plane filled with snakes. I enjoy good 'cheesey' films. But this is one of the worst movies I have ever had to endure. Its acting is terrible, script?? was there one and special effects are dreadful. Not only do the snakes look fake, but they look really badly fake. You can see it a mile off. There are exactly no scares, no shocks and no cunning plot twist. Its not fun, its not funny and its certainly not good. It is a bad bad movie and I truly pity the souls who enjoyed it.",Snakes on a Plane
505,Thugster963,Fun not serious,7,17 August 2006,"I went to the Thursday night showing on this movie. I like the late night showings of films because everyone there seems to be into the movie more then people during the mid day showings. I went to this movie because I thought it was going to be a fun movie. I took my girlfriend along and all the way there she was complaining about how stupid ""Snakes on a Plane"" would be. When we walked out she said she had fun. And at the end of the day that is what this movie is all about, having fun. I've seen most of this summers blockbuster such as Superman, X-men, MI3, and Pirates but out of all the movies I've seen this summer I've had the most fun with this one. So for anyone who wants to see a movie this summer with laughs, some scary parts, and an original story give this film a try it is worth your money. 7/10",Snakes on a Plane

Our Whole theatre was laughing out loud as parts, cheering at other parts, it was a great time!!!!!! As well on a serious note, the acting, tension, and action in the movie were not only acceptable, but GOOD!!!! i liked it, i have no complaints about the movie across the board... compared to other action movies lately that are trying to be serious, this one blows them out of the water!! do yourself a favor and go see the movie, some parts are very predictable but i believe thats what they wanted, you can see whats going to happen but instead of thinking ooooo well now its going to do this of course, your saying ""do it, do it, do it OOOOOOO YES""",Snakes on a Plane
507,jonadab,You have to like horror movies to appreciate this one.,4,18 February 2008,"If you thought Jaws was the best movie of the 1980s, then you probably want to see this one too. It's very similar, only with snakes instead of a shark, and a plane instead of beaches and boats.The plot is extremely thin (I would say worse than ""Manos"" the Hands of Fate) and on top of that is also very trite. Also, the major premise (that exposure to pheromones would cause a wide variety of snakes to actively hunt down and attack humans in monster-movie fashion) reminds me of an Ed Wood movie.However, Snakes on a Plane is rather better in other respects.For one thing, Snakes on a Plane makes a serious attempt to do real character development. A lot of horror movies don't bother, but this one does. There are several fairly well rounded characters and even a moderately dynamic character. There are numerous scenes wherein the viewer is likely to sympathize with one of the characters. There are also a couple of lame and/or stereotypical characters, but on the whole I would rate the character development as pretty good -- very good for a horror movie.The writing (in terms of the lines) is not great, but it's not extremely bad either (except in a few places there is some weak dialog), and almost all of the acting is passably good. (Most of the worst acting is pretty early in the movie, before the snakes get loose.) Indeed, there is even some quite good acting in places, particularly the two young boys.What really saves this movie from being a B Movie is that the technical aspects of the film (lighting and camera work and sound and scene editing and so on and so forth) are all pretty well done. Most really bad movies botch those things severely, but this one handles them more or less like a major motion picture.On the other hand, the special effects are rather poor. It is very obvious that most of the snakes you see are computer animated, and considering that the movie was made in 2006 it's third-rate computer animation at that. The snakes look very fake. On the other hand, they are very well integrated into the action. The live-action human characters interact with them very much as if they are really there. I did not notice a single instance where the human character's actions and the snakes' actions were out of sync. That helps a great deal, and it's yet another thing you'd never see pulled off correctly in a B movie.I'm not sure who labeled this movie an Action/Thriller. It's definitely a horror movie. Some aspects of it are particularly well-executed for a horror movie, but it's a horror movie through and through, from the monster's-eye-view camera shots looking out at the humans from behind things right on down to the scenes where you keep expecting someone to get attacked and it doesn't happen and doesn't happen and doesn't happen, and then just when you realize it's not going to happen then it suddenly does.The first few minutes are crammed with inane physical comedy (some of which is fairly vulgar, and none of which is even vaguely original), but I'm happy to say that almost all of that is done by the time the movie really gets underway.If you like horror movies, you'll want to see this one. If you don't particularly like horror movies, then you probably want to give it a miss.",Snakes on a Plane

I haven't had this much fun in years and I mean it. I haven't laughed this much in years. This movie made me laugh my ass off. No comedy movie has ever been made or will be made that will make you laugh as much as this. And its not even a comedy !! It goes well beyond its expectations of ""its so bad its good"". Snakes are everywhere and they are biting every single body part (male and female) in gruesome detail. Oh it was brilliant. Samuel L.Jackson delivers as expected and the movie just moves along briskly with no apologies, there is nothing like it. Go see this NOW.",Snakes on a Plane
509,charlesdeanpeters,This is NOT the reason we go see movies.,1,18 August 2006,"""Snakes on a Plane is the reason we go to see films.""No. Snakes On A Plane is the reason that audiences stopped showing interest in films in the early nineties and Hollywood had to start looking outside to independent film producers to get the audiences back. Because people, as a majority, got sick of the same formulaic, brainless formulas. Now this isn't to say they aren't still supplying these formulaic pieces of poo to audiences today but, if you've noticed, they've had to change up how they tell the story and bend to the needs of the audience. Look at films like ""V For Vendetta"", ""Requiem For A Dream"", ""Nightwatch"", ""Batman Begins"", ""28 Days Later"", ""Shaun Of The Dead"", and ""Memento"", etc.. These films are either recreations of the formula or styles that breakaway from formula all together. An interesting trend that has been really prevalent is the combining of multiple genres so that the film isn't entirely, easily classifiable and allows for an audience viewer to actually watch it instead of avoiding it because it's a ""Sci-Fi"" film or a ""Romantic Comedy"".Snakes On A Plane bores you and makes you laugh only because of the ridiculousness. The CGI is not strong enough to base a film on and actually stating that Samuel L. Jackson is good in this is an insult to Samuel L. Jackson. He has done better, this film was just a paycheck for him.Everything about this film blew Mary Kate bits all over my pants. I've seen a better plot in Fantastic Four and, with better acting and supporting cast. Supporting cast? Have of these people ran around being scared. They had not life as character, no faces. They were just screaming beings. They died and boy did I not care for them. I wanted the 3 G's dude to die. I wanted Tiffany to die. I was mad when Rick died because, hey, he was funny in Anchor Man! Good story, good plot and good characters, no matter how silly the premise may initially seem will always make a good movie. Snakes On A Plane is an example when these components don't' come together. Put simply: It blows!",Snakes on a Plane
510,anti-nickname,Delivered exactly what I wanted to see.,10,6 September 2006,"When describing my experience of viewing Snakes on a Plane to my friends, I typically describe it as such: ""There are these moments where you can't tell if you are shrieking in disgust or squealing with glee... those feelings just kind of blend together."" As a huge fan of horror films, and BAD horror films, I have to say that this movie gave me exactly what I wanted to see. I know that people have been talking about the disappointing box office gross from this film, but I honestly am not surprised by it. This is a film made for (and largely by) fans of these kinds of films, and that's a niche audience. If you are a part of this audience, this is a good film to watch. It's a fun blend of action, horror, and comedy. It's a movie that needs no parody because it honestly parodies itself with dialogue that express the characters' disbelief at the ongoing events. Samuel L. Jackson does not slack in his performance, and is a definite audience pleaser, as per usual. The computer-generated snakes could have been a little bit better, and some of the teeth-bearing effects were a little over-the-top, but added to the fun and comedic aspect of the film. Don't watch this film looking for depth or an incredibly well-thought-out, intricate action plot. Within 15-20 minutes--it might have been less, I have yet to see it again-- we have snake lift-off. From there, it's all shrieks, squeals, and laughs.",Snakes on a Plane

513,elcopy-2,The first cult classic of the 21st Century,8,21 August 2006,"In 1999 ""The Blair Witch Project"" was released amid a lot of hype that was created mostly online. This movie sparked the birth of modern movie marketing. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the movie didn't live up to the hype, but it set a standard movie studios have been trying to duplicate since. Enter ""Snakes on a Plane"", the movie with the campy title that becomes a cult hit even before anyone saw it. The movie studio felt they had something good brewing out of the grassroots campaign spreading while the movie was still in production, and embraced the fans. Blessing the unofficial marketing and even adapting fan ideas into the movie. It's the birth of the modern cult classic.Of course, the movie has to live up to the hype and to the title that promises campy, fun, summer action. And it does. I could even say the movie is better than its title (which I think is genius). Samuel L. Jackson to my surprise, only plays second banana to the real stars of the film: The snakes. There are all kinds and they attack from all sides and they're the most fun things I've seen in a movie in decades.Another sign of a modern cult classic is the product placement, which is cheesier than the plot wholes. From Red Bull, to the Palm Treo and Sony's Playstation 2 and PSP.The R rating is going to keep a lot of this movie's fans on hold for a bit, but I believe it was the right decision and it's going to be a home video with more lasting power on the shelves than 90% of the movies out there.

As usual, Samuel Jackson was wonderful. This movie met my expectations and more and I wish we could get more like this from Hollywood, regardless of genre. Finally, the animators have my respect. Good production from Canada, I think, if I properly recall Jackson's account on Jay Leno or some talk show regarding the film's history; it was sold and they were going to change the name and Jackson insisted it stay the same. Word of mouth will make this movie a blockbuster.",Snakes on a Plane

516,Epocalypse,Camp and Midnights: Pulp of Tomorrow,8,18 August 2006,"I won't tell you that SoaP is an ingenious film, its not. Neither, for the record, is George Romero's Zombie Zeitgiest ""Dead"" series. I say they are not ingenious films because they lack meaning, and deep intricate detail, excellent directing and plot. Neither is Adam West era Batman, but it defined a generation. What this is is an ingenious idea: A film that meets all of its promises, and goes to every and any length to satisfy the audience, the actors, and the third part of the new generation: The Internet. If you asked what this movie is about (and I would ask all the die-hard fans of camp horror to take a moment to realize that even your first momentary reaction was ""what the hell did I just read/hear?"") there is a good chance its not your film.This film is so honest about itself that it makes the title of Night of The Living Dead seem cryptic. If this film title theory was applied to that particular movie its title would become ""Dead People Who Come Back To Eat Other People"" or ""DPwCBtEOP"". This in itself sets the tone of the film. Adrenaline driven fan fun. This movie tried to raise its MPAA Rating to R based on internet request (and for the record it successfully did). Imagine if popular opinion played more into this film.This film runs rampant with its own sense of free wielding fun, which though directed mainly at high school and college guys, can give a lot of fun to the right set fans beyond that as well. This is film pulp fiction (no pun intended, although Jackson is a great actor who brings fun not only to himself but the entire audience): Its meaningless, its drivel, and its depraved, but it is so insanely absurd and surreal that you can't help but watch the screen as the metaphoric page turns. Its made for cheap fun and pull its weight every bit of the way.Now this is no film for everyone, you have to like camp and horror, and (although I hope this implied) have a solid stomach. If you meet that, than you were probably in the theater with me today. To its credit, SoaP is original for its genre, has a lot of creative spins on old standards, and new and different fun quotable lines (""Oh, Great, Snakes on Crack!"" is one of my favorites). Also, once again FOR THE GENRE, the acting was above par, and everyone was having fun.I will say this, one other group that really loves this kind of movie is Artists and Filmmakers of tomorrow. Films like this were the favorite of directors ranging from Lucas to Tarantino, lest we forget, even Spielberg started his career with JAWS. As a student who hopes to one day be among these men, I'll try to explain why I think we love it. It is because we love too see that there is something in comedy, in absurdity and horror, in camp and predictability that can still be fun and energetic to an audience. Sometimes, the unexpected can get you off the ground, but letting the people have what they were so happy to order can give you love. In a year or two, come Halloween, kids dressed as snakes, surfers, and Samuel L. Jackson will line up at midnight, with maracas in one pocket, and spring loaded snakes in another, and will proudly declare that they want to see ""Motherf**king Snakes on a Motherf**king Plane!""there is always something to be said for fun. No one left this movie unhappy, and I can't say that about Schindler's List.Peace Out Brothers and Sisters!",Snakes on a Plane

I don't want to go into details and spoil the ending, ( like that is possible ) so I wont list the inconsistencies mentioned above in case anyone could possibly enjoy watching this and, has any chance of being surprised at the end.The thing that surprised me the most was that Samuel L. Jackson would lower his acting career so much as to even appear in this slug.The only good thing about it was the fact that I watched it on HBO.

519,Richard_Lawson,"""Snakes on a Plane"" is a fun experience",6,18 August 2006,"I'm calling this an ""experience"" rather than a ""review"", because a review wouldn't really encapsulate how enjoyable this movie is. If I was forced to review the movie, I'd talk about how slow it is in the beginning, how although some of the dialog is witty quite a lot of it is hackneyed (a scene with SLJ telling JM to ""Be strong"" was especially cringe-worthy), and the climax didn't have a lot of tension and was a bit disappointing. Five stars out of ten sounds about right, and is perhaps a bit generous.But I came out of the movie with a smile on my face, because it was fun. The audience was really, really into it. When the title of the movie appeared, everyone cheered (I haven't seen that happen in a movie theater since Episode 1). Every over-the-top ""death by snake"" was cheered and applauded. The people who were going to die were fairly easily identified, and people eagerly awaited their death scenes. (In a nod to the movie writers, I expected one character to die for being a complete jerk, and they surprised me by having that character survive.) And, as could be expected, when SLJ delivers his much-discussed line towards the end of the film, the audience cheered throughout its entire delivery. I laughed; it was just fun to listen to the audience.This is not a movie you download via BitTorrent. This is not a movie you watch on cable, or rent via DVD. This is a movie you watch in a crowded movie theater. Because only then will it be fun; only then will the energy of the movie and the audience make the experience worthwhile.",Snakes on a Plane

Granted, something like this could possibly happen(and I hope I'm not on a plane when it does), but overall, it was a tense action movie. Samuel L. is in fine form--he's one of my heroes so I can't say anything negative about him. The snakes do make you feel all creepy-crawly-- and since I don't like snakes anyway, this movie was a bit of tense fun for our day off. See it just for the heck of it.

Sam Jackson is superb, the snakes are awessssome, and the movie is a textbook example of how to entertain people with gratuitous nudity and violence.The only flaw is that the rapper-dude character is not killed by the snakes, although that may be the only thing that is not completely predictable, and awesome, in this otherwise excellent movie.I am sure there will be a sequel, I am sure I will see it, and I am sure it will be horrible.But at least we got to see: Snakes on Plane!

Also I don't know if any of you have visited the official website but seeing the music video and some links such as Snakes on a Kindergarden caused me to squeal with joy.This is a must see for this summer! I'm just going to warn you that when you go to the theater you might want to wear plenty of support or else suffer the consequences of getting your balls totally blown off! Seriously, this movie is that good! The action sequences are bad ass! I found myself giving out high fives through out the movie. There were no slow moments. The CG was pretty amazing. Some of the best 3-D snakes that I have seen in movies. The shots of the plane flying are also done pretty good.

Here I was expecting poor Samuel L Jackson (SLJ as we affectionately call him) To have to carry the weight of an extremely cheesy movie on his poor, overly-burdened shoulders. But in fact this movie made a lot of sense. They made everything clear-cut,so that it wasn't just random snakes slithering onto a plane and deciding that every person on the plane must die. It was, however, a little gory and violent for my taste, as I am very squeamish. If you are squeamish, this movie is not for you. Regrettably, I spent much of the movie curled up in my seat with my eyes closed and my fingers in my ears, humming songs that I hoped would cover the horrified screams on the screen.

The beginning was low blow after low blow in terms of what you thought they would put in the film. Aside from pure hilariousness, and the fact that there were snakes on a plane, it would be an incredibly generic and clichéd action movie. So much to the point that you knew it was what they were intentionally going for. Nathan Phillips' acting was very much B-movie cheese, just listen to how he places phony inflection and awkward emphasis on certain parts of some lines. But yeah, that's what they wanted to make this movie work as such. Generic clichéd action movies are usually bad because they don't intend to be directly generic clichéd action movies on purpose.

But unlike most of the crappy movies that are heavily marketed today, I liked it.There really is nothing to be scared of in this film. The moments of terror are, instead, moments of hilarity. I'm convinced that this was the filmmakers' intention since they did such a good job of making me laugh during scenes in which people might normally be expected to scream. In a way, this film could be considered a parody of so many other poorly put together suspense thrillers.Overall, the movie has decent action sequences, almost campy writing, and the relatively unique idea of using snakes on an airplane. I gave it 7 stars on IMDb, which is my minimum rating for good movies. You won't be better or worse for seeing it, but if you can appreciate certain cinematic elements, I recommend you go for it. Plus, you can walk away with an infinite number of quotable Mad Libs-esquire lines like, ""Get this snake off my ****!""",Snakes on a Plane
531,Barnstormed,Utter crap from start to finish. Excellent :),7,27 April 2007,"There is absolutely nothing about this film that makes any sense at all. Utter crap from start to finish. Excellent. And a woman gets bitten on the boob. More excellent :)----------- Its directed by the guy who did Final Destination 2 so you pretty much know what you are going to get before you go in. Everything you expect is going to happen, happens.You get the feeling that they made exactly the film they wanted to make. There is zero attempt to make anything make sense, things happen without explanation and in a lot of places its just totally illogical. You forgive it all these things though simply because you know its laughing with you. Its all there - the characters you are supposed to hate so you cheer when they die, the hero, babies, animals etc etc. Samuel L. is obviously having a great time and although the whole film is played for laughs, the characters in it treat it like the life and death situation its meant to be. You get the feeling that they wrote the film and then realised that they hadn't actually figured out a way to get the ""motherfucking snakes on the motherfucking plane"" in the first place. The setup is ridiculous but fits perfectly with the rest of the film. You can pick at the plot holes and flaws as much as you want but there is no point. They know they are there but the film makers clearly don't give a rats.In short its crap, but crap in the best sense. You know whats going to happen and cheer when it does. Its jumpy and messy and makes you laugh.I'd recommend it.",Snakes on a Plane

Then a light dawned, they gave a million snakes a typewriter each and after much hissing and clicking, boom you have it SNAKES ON A PLANE! Your better than average snake's wet dream. I did have a good time, making dumb comments to my fellow moviegoers. There was so much to make fun of I couldn't believe it. And as for movie history, this was one of the first movies that actually dropped my I.Q. level 10 full points. (Snide comments here) I'm not even going to get into how dim-witted the plot line was, nor how absurd the script was. For all you who loved it because it made you laugh at the stupidity of this film, OK point taken.

Jesus i gave it a chance and it was cliché and horrible so peace i am out of here and my boy Saviano agrees... oh i have to write 10 lines minimum to be on this page of opinion... so i will just have to tell u that we need to have a movie with Travolta and Jackson and Andy Garcia with Jeremy Piven and Robert De Niro.

534,talbmail,A bad movie with horrible scenes and no point absolutely.,3,31 August 2006,"Yes. I've seen snakes on a plane. I'm not a fan of horror movies but I said, what the heck, I'll watch it. And believe me, I regretted it. First of all, the scenery on snakes on a plane is really illogical. Whatever, let's face it - It's junk. I like Samuel L. Jackson, but even he with his great talent and humor couldn't save this movie. The horrifying scenes with absolutely no point at all - Snake tears this and that, rips ones throat. The movie is totally humorless and all attempts to make it funny failed. First of all, I ask why couldn't they fly him on a special plane. Next, I ask how is it possible that they got a bomb into the plane to release the snakes. Next, I ask why didn't they make an emergency landing. Afterwards, I ask who is the idiot responsible for the effects? They were very lame and weak, animations of the outside of the plane in the storm was very unconvincing. The snakes themselves, especially in the scene where they flew out of the window look very unrealistic. The movie's beginning is very quick, bringing your directly to the action within 5 minutes after the movie began. The plot itself is not impressive, the movie script does not focus on any character at all, especially not on the 'hero', the prosecutor. The only thing we know about him is that he rides a bike and his name. The scenes are again, VERY SICK, with outrageous moments. The movie is great for watching with friends and screaming, I am really not anti-junk movie person. But if you choose to go with your friends to the cinema and you care about the quality of the movie you are watching - Do yourself a favor and don't go to this movie. Save your ten bucks. The plot is really not worth anything and Samuel L. Jackson adds very little spice to the movie. Not recommended.",Snakes on a Plane

I was a bit worried when there was only 18 people in the cinema and when i saw the opening titles. But I'm glad i saw it, what a rocking film i don't usually jump at scares but when that snake came out of the cockpit floor doors (people who have seen this will know what i mean) god did people jump. The acting was believable and some of the deaths quite unnerving with groins, chests, eyeballs, ears necks and mouths all being attack points for the snakes. The snakes in question did look cgi but it didn't ruin the film. Today i learnt most of the snakes where real but obviously had their venom removed. So many funny scenes in the film also made it great with the new captain's announcement had us in stitches and also the death of Mary Kate.

536,Jeffehcom,Very Overrated,5,27 August 2006,"I can't believe this movie has gotten the high ratings it has, and found myself laughing at the dialog and sledge-hammered snake biting moments. There was absolutely no finesse to this at all, and the director must have taken suspense lessons from Alfred HitchCRAP! I generally like even the mediocre stuff that Samuel Jackson does, so this definitely surprised and disappointed me. I most resented the repetitive and incredibly gross images of the snakes biting people, which were overdone to the point of being gratuitous, and lost all sense of artistry.WARNING... SPOILERS The scene where the boa constrictor crushes and then swallows the head of the elitist schmuck was at least a variation, disgusting and yet somehow a little cooler than most other clips, but still just horrific. Perhaps the one line that was worth keeping, because it's complete pulp and vintage Jackson is the ""I'm sick of these m____ f_____' snakes on this m____ f_____' plane"". Jeez!",Snakes on a Plane

Ridiculous music when it's supposed to be scary, makes it comic! And when you are supposed to see from the snakes vision; that is poorly made! I was surprised that it actually was a plot except from the obvious fact that there were snakes on the plane :P But seriously, change the genre to comedy & action, and remove horror/thriller and I would actually give this film a 8/10.

The only thing that keeps me from granting it a full ""10"" is the occasional attempts on the part of the director to make it actually have narrative value, a mistake which happens only in occasional moments and is easily glossed over by the fact that there are SNAKES on a PLANE.

I don't even know where such an evil idea would come from. yet it's such an original idea that it becomes a memorable one.This is a ""So bad it's good"" kind of movie.But, keeping an open mind about this movie, it is not one to be taken seriously. It's an escape from the real world.Helping to transport viewers to this fantasy are the effects, which are well done. the animation of the snakes is done great, and the scene where Samuel L. Jackson shoots out the window, even though not possible, looks like it could happen.If you haven't gotten a hold of the DVD, I suggest doing so and watching the commentary.

The story is about a witness who is being escorted by the FBI from Hawaii to LA on a commercial flight to testify against a gangster. And the great crooked genius - the mafia don selects snakes as his deadliest weapon to kill the witness as well as bring down the entire plane in this pathetic narration.

543,sonny_chiba_lives,"Leave the making and praising of cult movies to the professionals, kids.",3,23 August 2006,"Those praising this movie are pegging themselves as Johnnies-come-lately to the bad-movie canon. Congratulations, you figured out that ""Snakes on a Plane"" was going to suck. Fine, Samuel L. is a one-note joke to you. But where were you when ""Alone in the Dark"" came out? Or ""The One""? Or ""The Fog""? Studios put out a dozen half-assed, schlocky thrillers every year, and just because one of them kept its working title, people are bowing down left and right.Honestly, my favorite part of the movie was the first scene with Byron Lawson and the prosecutor. That's the kind of terrible movie I can enjoy, one with aspirations to toughness; one that doesn't fall back on winks. Lawson's gangster is totally unconvincing, and the back-and-forth bravado between good guy and bad guy are straight out of ""Commando,"" or anything from PM Entertainment.Once everyone's on the plane, though, it's just a typical horror film. Broad characters forced to interact with each other. There's no one to root for OR against, and that's a huge misfire. It was painful to see how few extras could be summoned for Flex Alexander's supposedly famous rapper, a guy who can only afford two chunky bodyguards (No charter jet? What kind of rapper is this?). Rachel Blanchard quickly discards a snooty-rich-girl characterization in favor of something much blander. Nathan Phillips is deadly dull, completely upstaged by everyone around him, and a terrible match for an already reducted SLJ, who strolls amiably through the obviously inferior material. In theory, David Koechner's lecherous co-pilot would've served both as welcome comic relief and an Obvious Target, but ""Snakes"" wastes him, just reduces him to a curious extended cameo.Also, this film misses a huge opportunity: visceral revenge. There wasn't nearly enough snake-whacking! I would've much rather seen the band of survivors unite to rain physical punishment upon some reptiles than the eye-rolling solution which Sammy concocts. Add to that the fact that to stop cold-blooded creatures, all one would have to do was turn the temperature to about 65. I know ridiculous action pictures needn't adhere to reality-based conditions, but this movie has so much contempt for its audience, I feel like it owed us some sort of explanation.Truly bad movies are organic: a hundred compromises, setbacks, and lowered sights conspire to create awful art. ""Snakes on a Plane"" isn't quite there, but it would've been closer had it been left alone by a bunch of kids suckling at irony's teat. As it is, it's mild entertainment being masqueraded as something else by impatient groupthinkers.

Very creative kills by both the snakes and the passengers. 3/10 for the movie-making, 10/10 for the fun-factor, 9/10 for the 'popcorn flick / crowd reaction' = 8/10 from me.

The scenes will likely be most popular among the 14-year-old crowd, and this is why I love this movie. ""Snakes on a Plane"" is not entirely without redeeming qualities, however. Some lessons we can learn from this movie are: 1. Fornicating in an airplane bathroom stall will lead to a horrible and surprisingly embarrassing death. 2. No matter what group of quirky strangers Fate lumps you in with in a test of death or survival, everyone will bring with them useful talents and assets to the group, so don't annoy them. 3.

Most people have seen an internet spoof, heard the Snakes On A Plane theme song, or received a phone call from Samuel L Jackson telling them to see the best goddamn movie of the summer. Snakes On A Plane has had the best marketing for a film in a long time. The creative marketing, intense hype, and Samuel L Jackson's refusal to be in the movie unless it carried the title ""Snakes On A Plane"" led me straight into the theater, curious at the least. I figured Snakes On a Plane would be so awesomely bad that it would be worth my money.I was wrong about one thing. Snakes On a Plane was not awesomely bad as I had hoped. It was just awesome. Creative dialogue, interesting characters, and great snake attack scenes combined to make a very entertaining film. Going into the theater I was worried that the movie would depend too heavily on Samuel L Jackson cussing out snakes for comic relief. And while Samuel L Jackson does cuss out the snakes (in a very serious tone) the cast of supporting characters offer one liners that are much better than the ones found in similar films. The rap star and his bodyguards, the flamboyant male stewardess, and the flirtatious copilot, among others, all contribute very well to the film.The snake attack scenes were well planned as well. The filmmakers (with the help of Mr. Jackson) did a good job keeping the scenes varied and creative. The passengers on the plane are bitten in both creative ways and areas (some of which might sting a little more than normal).Of course the story is fairly simple, the movie is titled ""Snakes On A Plane"" after all, but is thorough enough to be effective, and effective it is. This could have easily been a PG-13 B movie with very little entertainment value like so many other films featuring animal attacks. Without Samuel L. Jackson, it may have ended up on the Sci-fi channel. But thanks to Mr. Jackson's insistence that the movie needed an R rating to be quality, SOAP received the scenes it needed to make it more than just an average action/suspense film.I really cannot stress enough how pleased I was during the entirety of this film.",Snakes on a Plane

553,wandersfar,"Not bad for what it is, but doesn't live up to the hype",5,5 June 2007,"I finally broke down and watched this movie, just to see if it could possibly live up to all the hype. Not surprisingly, it didn't quite hit that balance between camp and classic B-movie gore. It obviously couldn't be good enough to be a ""good"" movie, but it also wasn't bad enough to be a great ""bad"" movie, and so I'll rate it as okay, but mediocre.The main thing it lacked was more camp. With a name like ""Snakes on a Plane"", that's pretty much what I expected and hoped for. The weird attempts at pathos during some of the character deaths ruined that for me. If you're going for a camp horror film, with plenty of gratuitous nudity, profanity, and horror movie clichés, you can't then have ""poignant"" dramatic deaths without some serious eye-rolling on the viewer's part.Bottom line, at times it felt as if it was taking itself way too seriously, which just seemed out of place for this kind of film.The dialogue wasn't as funny as I expected, and save for that one great line (""I have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!"") it was pretty forgettable and kind of clunky. I literally just watched ""Snakes on a Plane"", and except for Jackson's infamous quote, I can't remember a single funny one-liner in the entire movie. And even that line was sort of dropped in there. (No comedic lead-in, Jackson just randomly yelled it.) The problem, I think, is that too much time was spent on plot development and exposition (why the snakes are there, why are they so violent, who's behind it all, etc.) which frankly, I couldn't care less about. I wanted Snakes. On. A. Plane, damnit! in all its crazy nonsensical glory, and while I did get my snakes on a plane, someone decided to splice in half of a Law and Order episode for no discernible reason.I think casting Julianna Margulies as one of the female leads was a mistake. I think she's a fabulous actress, but she does her best work in serious or semi-serious dramas (ER, The Lost Room) and in what should have been a farce, she was just an inappropriate choice.This movie needed to be more ridiculous and over-the-top, which seems like an odd criticism, but one appropriate for the genre.",Snakes on a Plane

You have seen every scene in other movies. We have Samuel L. Jackson crawling through the plane's innards with wires dangling in front of him looking vaguely like snakes. I immediately thought of the first Alien movie. There is an obnoxious snooty fellow who you secret wish to be victimized. Can you guess what happens? The movie does not disappoint!

Little does he know that his precious snakes will be up against the likes of Neville Flynn, a hard hitting, hard cursing FBI agent that refuses to fool around. People die (predictably and laughably). People run (predictably and laughably). Samuel Jackson acts like a bad*ss muthaf*cka (predictably and laughably).Look, you already know if you're going to like this movie or not - everything you're expecting to happen ""Snakes on a Plane"" does to great effect, good or bad. If you want to see it because it'll suck hard, you won't be disappointed and will enjoy laughing at every horribly cheesy, badly delivered line and every over-the-top snakebite and death. That's the long and short of this movie - you know exactly what you're getting because they've told you from day one what you're getting (and even reshot a few scenes to satisfy fans - how many Hollywood movies would go so far?), and for that, even naysayers should be appreciative.I'm hoping this movie does well - it will show Hollywood that, perhaps if they actually give people what they want and ask, their movies will actually be successful and make them money. Hopefully this movie will start a trend of movies delivering what they say they will.The only gripe - too much romance, not enough snakes :)",Snakes on a Plane
558,andy_roberts,Don't Bother,1,2 January 2007,"The movie started well I thought but totally lost the plot mid way and most definitely at the end. I couldn't decide whether this was a comedy or an attempt at a serious movie. For me I was laughing all the way! It was obvious that all the pilots were going to suffer the snake wrath but what really made me laugh my head off was the idea a kid with ""5000 hours"" of flight time on the Play Station 2 could land a 747 along with all the attitude on the radio!! That was enough, had to reach for the tissues to wipe away my tears of laughter. I guess it's worth watching just for that!

559,thrillerinmanila,here is why this sucks,1,29 August 2006,"they tried to make this serious. it's so obvious. this was supposed to a thriller. not a campy b- movie. there is nothing campy about it. i was SOOOO excited to see it. because i thought it would be terrible on purpose. and the beginning was promising. and i laughed a couple of times. and the first snake bites were good. but then it slowly dawned on me that this movie was an accident. it was supposed to be a thriller - like anaconda etc. - and somehow the studio screwed it up so bad they were saved by the bell, ie. the internet community who thought it was fun camp. in the end, it was just BORING. and not even about the snakes. it was about bringing the goddamn snake down. sam jackson didn't kill a single snake in the second half!! what's up with that??? i promise you. get jeff katz the executive on this or David ellis drunk and ask - was this supposed to be a fun camp movie or an on-the-edge-of-your-seat thriller and they'll tell you it was supposed to be a thriller. think jaws. and it turned out to be this. and that's why it sucks.",Snakes on a Plane
560,kaemera,A good old-fashioned B-movie roller-coaster,8,26 August 2006,"I had heard all the hype and read all the stories about internet fanbases and such, but wasn't sure if the movie was good. Watching it on your own at home may not work so well, but seeing it in a theatre with a dozen noisy, hyperactive friends (like I did) makes this an awesome piece of B-grade cheese pumped up with early-noughties film techniques.The plot, such as it is, can be summed up really quickly (for those who haven't heard already): A young surfer witnesses a murder and is placed under the protection of the FBI to testify against the killer, but said killer fills the Honolulu-to-Hawaii red eye with hundreds of poisonous snakes high on pheromones which wind them up into a killing frenzy.But enough about that. Samuel L Jackson is excellent in his role as the FBI superman, somewhere between his role in ""The Negotiator"" and a parody of Jules in ""Pulp Fiction."" Julianna Margulies is great as the sarcastic stewardess. Nathan Phillips is pretty good as the murder witness, but there wasn't much in the way of acting involved in his role. That in mind, he does a good job with what's there. And there are some other great, hilarious performances by people playing RnB stars (and their bodyguards), daffy blondes with tiny dogs in their purses, the passenger who's scared of flying (and that's before the snakes come out), the pilot who sexually harasses the stewardesses, the woman with a baby, two little boys flying along for the first time... the list of clichés goes on.The effects are pretty good, the music works well, and there are quite a few sudden jolts as snakes dart out of dark corners, vents, and assorted other nastier places. There are claustrophobic crawls through ducts, fort-under-siege stand-offs, utterly predictable budding romances, a lucky couple who join the Mile High Club, some zany one-liners, and just about every scary snake you can poke a stick at.So to sum up, if you go in expecting a Hollywood blockbuster, an intelligent plot, detailed and subtle character development, or anything else that requires much thought process, you may be disappointed. But as long as you sit down without expectations like these, with a huge popcorn in one hand and a big gulp in the other, completely unprepared to take it seriously, you'll have a blast.",Snakes on a Plane

Everyone in the theater was having such a good time watching this movie. It's really a thrill ride of a movie. It is such an ""awesome"" movie because...1. Samual Jackson, does a great job at what he does best, yell. Absolutely his best performance since Pulp Fiction. 2. Diverse Characters, the characters in the movie are perfect just the right blend of funny and serious, really mixes well together. 3. Writing, again just the right blend of pure comedy or clear shock and horror.In many parts this movie can not be taken seriously. In many parts it is taken very seriously. What this movie achieves is just the right blend of characters, just the right blend of action, and just the right blend of horror.

Its creativity and originality that keeps art alive, From the begging of time, there have been men and women brilliant beyond comprehension, and of course, there were men and women, who were, well they were not recording into history and taught in humanities classes thats for sure. And Snakes on a Plane is one of the most dismissible movies I've seen in recent years. There are some pretty lame screenplays floating around out there, but this just takes the cake. Its cool that a lot of teenage kids find it to be quite amusing, as they should. But the bar has been lowered. Ten years ago Teens were being amused with high quality epics like Jurrasic park, and movies that were well done, and still meant for a good laugh or a scare. The scariest thing about Snakes on a Plane is the fact that it exists. I love Books, theater, and films, and I love all films not just extremely intelligent art films. But Snakes is so obnoxiously bad, and I am sorry to say that it is one of the worst movies ever to be printed onto a reel of film, its to bad that this is what entertainment is coming to. Its very depressing. Skip this movie if you haven't already figured it out from the title. Its a terrible waste of time and money.

Besides the never to be seen again casting of JLo-Cube-O.Wilson-Stoltz-Wuhrer in the same flick, you had Jon Voight pulling off the all-time cinematic heist. His final scene alone represents everything SOAP tried and failed to do as a ""so-ludicrous-it's-fun"" movie.In the end, Snakes on a Plane is definitive proof that studio execs and fanboys make the worst collaborators possible. Every big scene had been discussed and dissected so much the last year, all that was left to amuse by opening night was the amount of fanboy flop-sweat that had to be mopped up at my theater.

Jackson's best line is one for the ages. the movie is absurd, they know it and unremorseful. maybe the best of its genre ever (genre includes deep rising, anaconda, arachniphobia, lake placid, etc.) check that, its the best of its genre, hands down. it is a memorable movie, one that you will constantly reference for days, maybe years, after seeing it. for example, i just looked to my left, and there are two bugs on my white shirt. that could be a sequel, ""bugs on a shirt,"" for example.",Snakes on a Plane

""hey lets make a movie with... snakes... and a plane..."" and threw the worst plot in the movie just so it would be recognizable as a movie. I feel dumber, being a human, knowing humans made this piece of trash. I was truly amazed at how pumped up this movie was, and that people even liked it. See i heard bad things about the movie... figured it was bad, but when i finally got a hold of it a was ready to watch it, I went in with a good attitude towards the movie, you know it IS Samuel L. Jackson... great actor no doubt, but obviously very very desperate, i mad 5 predictions in the movie.. all 5 were true, although one wasn't entirely to what i said was gonna happen, the general idea of what i predicted happened... my advice is, when you watch the movie, watch it with friends and make predictions, whoever gets the most right...

567,mcbainbmr,Samuel L taking himself seriously - NOT!,5,14 July 2016,"With a title like this, let's assume that was a ""working title"" for this Samuel L Jackson vehicle which bristles with references to pretty much every other airplane disaster movie ever made - and it simple revels in this premise.Samuel L loves films where he doesn't have to take himself seriously; and this is one of the best examples of that sub-genre. He is escorting a key witness by plane to testify at the drug trial of the century, and every attempt to silence the witness has so far failed. So what if the plane he was on was invaded by crazed snakes smuggled onboard. Seems reasonable, doesn't it? Once the delinquent snakes find their way into every crevice of the plane, the ""one man against delinquent snakes on plane"" forces Samuel L to resort to ever-increasingly elaborate ways to kill them off, culminating in the sort of outburst only he could scream without laughing: ""I am f***ing tired of these m*****f***** snakes on this m******f****** plane!!!"" - Really, if Oscars were awarded for delivering one-liners, Mr Jackson would surely win.In what many might view as a homage to Airplane! the passengers are a delightfully disparate motley crew, with the token ""this is my last flight before I retire"" stewardess and so on. Short of a nun playing a guitar to an ill girl, it's got all the other characters as well as ground crew desperate to find a serum for those already bitten by the snakes concerned.It's fun. It's not meant to be taken seriously, which is why I suspect it never got further than a working title but if ever a film was a ""does what it says on the tin"" title, this is it.

Well if you like films with deep plots and lots of twists then this film is not for you. If you have phobias about snakes don't see this film, but if you like well shot action films with a little humour thrown in to break the tension then this is definitely a must see. The beginning had a few small holes but that was totally forgotten the second that the plane gets airborne. You know exactly what is going to happen and when it does it really takes your breath away with the immediate action that simply does not stop until the credits roll. Yes there were several times that i jumped when the i didn't expect the shockers and yes several times i guessed what was going to happen next which in my book all goes to make a very enjoyable cinema experience. The visual effects were all to real sometimes although some of the CGI on the snakes was a bit lame.

For months now, we have been hearing all the hype about 'Snakes on a Plane'. We've seen countless commercials and adds. We've seen TV interviews from actors. We've read interviews in magazines, and we've seen more fans sites on the web pop-up than was ever thought possible. And the damn movie wasn't even out yet! The entire time sitting in the theater waiting for the movie to begin, i watched countless people walk into the theater with fake snakes swinging around their heads, and 'Snakes on a Plane' t-shirts. And all threw the previews, all i could hear were people hissing. This only went to show how big this movie really was.I stand here saying now, after watching a pre-screening the night before release, this lived up to ALL of the hype, and then some. If you like action movies, of any kind, or comedies of any form, then do yourself a favor and see this film. It doesn't skimp out on anything.From flat-out non-stop action sequences, to black humor, back to nudity/sex, and good 'ol one liners that you can quote for years, this movie has it all. My side was splitting I was laughing so hard, along with the entire audience. At one point in the film, more than half of the audience stood up to give the movie a standing ovation.All of you should do yourselves a big favor and go and see this movie. It's possibly the GREATEST action-comedy of all times. There is NOTHING that is not to love about this film. It's my nomination for Best Picture 2006 this year at the Oscars, 'V for Vendetta' being a close second.

583,Sittingdowninpoppies,100 minutes of half-brained fun,8,20 August 2006,"Despite being a late summer blockbuster solely intended to make cash and display a very ""cool"" idea (Snakes on a plane), SoaP is actually a quite good unexpected comical movie.The lead acting in this movie is sub-par at best. Sam Jackson isn't much different than his typical ""cool guy"" role.(which isn't really a bad thing, except for it negating the viewers' perspective of his acting performance) Julianna Margulies, and Nathan Phillips deliver exceptionally average performances in their leading roles. It was the surprising performances of Rachel Blanchard, as a quite charming, eccentric person obsessed with her puppy, Bruce James, who does a phenomenal job with his role, and most of the other supporting cast that really made the overall acting of this movie good. 9 stars out of 10.Story - The story in SoaP is perhaps the worst part of it. A man witnesses a murder caused by a very influential crime lord, (see Enemy of the State)and Sam Jackson finds this man (nathan Phillip's character) and accompanies him on an escort mission to Las Angeles. Then we see the plane. OOO Snakes are on it. The story is basically over at that point. (asside from the attack of the snakes of course, but i don't consider that to be ""plot"") I honestly could not find any them in this movie whatsoever, except for of course the *do not count your chickens before they hatch* one, in the case that Sam and crew were oblivious to the fact that snakes could get passed undetected, and thought they were in the clear. 5 stars out of 10 Special Effects- the effects were very well done and scary. I very much enjoyed the realistic snake attacks and so forth. Score 9 out of 10 Humor/Extra stuff- I don't believe this movie is considered a comedy but it is definitely more than anything, funny. I laughed very hard at the insane ways the people were getting killed. *spoiler* for example, two people were getting it on so to speak in the bathroom when 2 venomous snakes crawled through a hole in the wall. One snake took out the guy while the other decided to bite the woman in the um... upper area. *end spoiler* There are quite a few other cases like this. Also, there are some absurdly funny supporting actors which add a great deal of humor. For example, Kenan Thomson appears in this flick, though not a wonderful actor, he could not make me stop laughing. Humour extras 10 out of 10 General- This is a pretty good movie that anyone above the age of 15 should try to watch in their spare time.

Destined to be a lukewarm cult film for teens, about the best we can say is that Samuel L. is The Man for insisting that the film keep it's original working title of ""Snakes on a Plane"". One thing of note to parents- children may have been lured to the film because of all the promotional efforts and the film was originally rated PG-13. Additional footage took it to R and it contains scenes that are too strong for most pre-teen and younger teen children.",Snakes on a Plane
585,-=Björn=-,Pure stupidity,1,21 August 2006,"Pardon me for slamming this movie, I did go to see it by chance, and maybe i didn't get some vital aspect of it, but to me its just purely stupid.Apart from the plot being just ridiculous - on the level of many B-movies - the main proposition that snakes would go on a rampage on an airplane is certainly lacking some credibility, with pheromones or without. Anyone who has been on an airplane at the altitude they are at will know that its cold, and even more cold in the cargo bay than in the passenger compartment... snakes would not have been able to even move out of the crate they were in... they are cold blooded... Spent most of the time laughing at the stupid story, but luckily i was in good company.I really don't get it... whats cult about stupidity?/bp",Snakes on a Plane

Going in thinking this was going to be a B movie with some good laughs, I went with a friend and had a couple of cocktails beforehand. I think that everyone else in the theater had done the same because the theater was rowdy before the movie even started. Needless to say, I never stopped laughing. This movie got worse and worse and funnier and funnier. It is far and away, the best movie theater experience I've ever had--bar none. The crowd was into it. The laughs were non-stop. I would recommend seeing this movie inebriated...great time. Movie 2 out of 4 stars, experience 5 out of 4 stars.",Snakes on a Plane

The whole thing is ridiculous, why not just plant a bomb instead of snakes on the plane. I have to agree with those that have written reviews like mine before and say that I can NOT understand how people can give this movie 9 or 10! It seems like this movie only made it big in the States, maybe that says more about the people the than the movie itself and therefore could be a reason for those ridiculously high reviews. On the other hand, I've never been a big fan of Samuel Jackson, at least not after Pulp Fiction, he seems to have a talent for picking the wrong rolls... or maybe he just doesn't get better offers, I don't know. But at least I've decided I'm never going to see another movie featuring him again.",Snakes on a Plane
588,chriscollier_2008,"Snakes, Action, Snakes, Plane, Snakes etc",10,25 August 2006,Finally this year a film that had me glued to the screen from start to finish. Plot... check out the title. This film certainly did deliver snakes on a plane but also great action but also a great dose of humour throughout.I went into this movie expecting to see a cheesy 'B' movie wannabe and was pleasantly surprised. All of the characters are cpmpelling and add considerably to the films development and the bits that are designed to make the audience squirm or jump certainly deliver.If you're looking for action combined with humour and a fat bloke being bitten on the ass by a snake then this is definitely the movie for you.Most importantly see this in a cinema to get the full effect. Thank you for making a film that I thoroughly enjoyed and had my full attention from start to finish!,Snakes on a Plane
589,In_Black_Men,Spits in the face of the common action film,10,17 August 2006,"I was lucky enough to get an 11:30 viewing on Thursday the 17th; it was amazing to say the least. The audience was comprised of extremely anticipating fans such as myself, and in the back of my mind I was terrified that the movie would have been over-hyped and a severe letdown. Me, as well as the rest of the crowd, were very pleased. The film doesn't ever lose it's pace, and well-timed comic relief synchronizes perfectly with the bloody suspense in the air. The first victims of the snakes is incredibly memorable, and when Samuel L. Jackson delivers his instantly famous line, regarding his irritability with these mother-loving snakes on this mother-loving plane, it doesn't take a genius to realize this movie is going to be a classic for years to come.",Snakes on a Plane
590,philo-27,Loved it!,10,20 August 2006,"This movie is great escapist fun! For one thing, with a title like ""Snakes on a Plane"" there's no trying to fool the audience as to what it is. There's something refreshing about a movie that wears its heart upon its sleeve and makes no pretensions of being anything other than what it is. Yes, it's a B-movie; most of the snakes are obviously CGI, and, yes, any minimally informed person knows that snakes don't behave in the ways depicted on screen. It has absolutely nothing to do with reality, but isn't that supposed to be what escapist movies are about anyway? I laughed and jumped my way through the entire 100 minutes. Highly recommended.",Snakes on a Plane
591,shizzcrizz707,A Movie For Movie Lovers,10,18 August 2006,"When Samuel L. Jackson said that the only way to surpass the awesomeness of ""Snakes On A Plane"" was to make another movie called ""Mo' M****f*****' Snakes On Mo' M****f*****' Planes,"" he wasn't joking. This is the most fun I've ever had sitting in a movie theater. No, I wasn't sitting. I was rolling around in my chair unable to stop smiling for an entire 105 minutes.The energy in the theater was like nothing I've ever seen before. I saw the movie in Charlottesville, VA, and it was more like a rock concert starring Samuel L. Jackson than a movie. When the theater was packed and the time for the movie had arrived, the lights cut on and everyone looked to the back of the theater. It was like we were schoolchildren, and the substitute teacher just walked in.He proceeded to tell the theater that the last showing resulted in a visit from the police, as the audience became too rowdy. People demanded refunds, the movie was stopped, etc, etc. That's right. This movie is so great, it caused a riot in a movie theater.When Samuel L. Jackson's name appeared on the screen, the entire audience cheered. It was indeed a concert, as everyone just yelled whatever they wanted to whenever they wanted to.""Where are the snakes?!"" someone yelled from the back side of the theater. The snakes had not yet appeared in the movie.""On a plane!"" replied another from the audience. It was as if we all were the same, and if you thought something, someone else in the audience was thinking the same thing. And they let you know what they were thinking, too.The best part of the movie, by far, was during Samuel L. Jackson's signature line of the movie, which included his signature 12-letter swear word. If you can't figure it out, it rhymes with the words ""brother"" and ""trucker"". After saying the first few words, the audience finished it for him. The only thing I can compare it to is ""Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" complete with audience participation and an energy you will never see in a movie theater again.""Snakes On A Plane"" truly is a great movie. It's a movie for people who love going to the movies, shouting at the screen, and generally having an amazing time. This is the most fun I have ever had watching a movie, and I wish I was kidding. 10 out of 10 stars.",Snakes on a Plane

Yeah, there were its key moments...like the whole quote from Sam which was applauded in my showing.The movie itself was really funny as well. But to the point that it was not stupid as most said it would be.Even if you thought this film would be stupid you're in for a surprise.

What I don't get is how there are so MANY favorable reviews for this movie! Over 50 percent of the IMDb votes are a TEN rating??? Are you you kidding me? People must be on drugs to be voting anything above a TWO for this completely tasteless and down right boring flick. What's sad about this is when garbage movies like this get such high ratings, it has the effect of watering down or skewing the entire rating system, which is really unfair for the real decent films.C'mon people... vote while sober!",Snakes on a Plane

The comedy delivered, in most cases, in such a serious manner, adds to the hilarity. The snakes are as campy as the actors...and you will applaud Sam and Julie and the plane's ultimate pilot. They threw in everything an audience would want including the kitchen sink. AND even with the hilarity, there are some great thrills and chills. I think the only way to enjoy this movie is on the BIG SCREEN with an extra large popcorn and soda. When Sam delivers his famous line, you want to stand up and applaud! From looking at the trailers, I thought the snakes would look very CGI, but to me most of 'em looked as real as the 450 of them were. BE there or Be square!",Snakes on a Plane

It ended up actually being a pretty decent movie if you count out the fact that it is not really realistic and the pointless nudity. There also was the guy who got bit peeing which was kinda funny and stupid, but the characters were also likable so in the end I thought it kinda made up for it. Toward the end there is a scene where Shawn gets shot and you don't know what to think for a minute. I think it was a really good addition to the movie. I also thought it was really cool that they added the infamous line about the mf snake on the mf plane, because of the fans.",Snakes on a Plane
597,koziki2003,Samuel what were you thinking,1,28 March 2007,"First I have to say I like Samuel L Jackson , but now I won't be watching movies just because he's in them I was totally disappointed, this couldn't be the same actor that was in Pulp Fiction , but yes sad but true.The script was poor as were the special effects, there was some comic value but I'm not sure if that was what the director had intended,The part where the oxygen masks drop and the snakes start biting LAME. Maybe one of the writers or the director should have watched a National Geographic special on snakes or any documentary to learn a little more about snakes to make the plot a little more believable , snakes bite inject venom and let go, these were some new pit bull species that the passengers had to pull and pry from their faces. The snakes didn't even look real, except the shots that used real snakes I can't believe this was nominated for an award, whatever a Saturn Award is? And for best Horror film yet. I thought up for a Razzie maybe. But I have seen worse I'm surprised it has such a high rating on IMDb it's not deserved.Even Samuel L Jackson cannot save this; I hope they don't make a sequel not that I will waste my time.",Snakes on a Plane
598,aj_sff4949,"SoaP thrills, and doesn't disappoint",7,26 August 2006,"This movie, even one that has been highly hyped such as this one was, isn't exactly a disappointment but isn't a classic that will always be cherished for years to come. With that being said Snakes On A Plane (SoaP) was streaky at best, with very high highs, and low lows. But the lows simply did not outpace the more upbeat moments in the movie, as predictable as it were, and it still jolted even the most skeptical of those in the theater due to the sheer quantity (not necessarily quality) of thrilling moments, as well as the anticipation of the lead character Samuel L. Jackson's infamous line circulated throughout the pre-launch campaigns hype circuit.All in all, SoaP was a movie I would see again, maybe a rental when it comes out, then again every other year or so, just for good measure, because in all honesty, some of the acting resembled a B-Movie or even foreign films when it came to a believable portrayal of the events they were experiencing, as in a far too evil villain and far too many ""oblivious to danger"" heroes which made for most of the film's predictability, as this film's plot is blunt (as is its title, which is to be expected) therefore the movie compares best to a James Bond flick in my opinion, as far as the overall mood goes anyways. What I mean by that is, you KNOW what is going to happen (as in James Bond will elude the bad guys) but will inevitably have all the bullets miss him and he kills them all and/or makes a miraculous escape, and you knew that was going to happen, you were just wondering HOW it would happen. So don't let predictability disappoint your possible opinion of SoaP, because like that same James Bond flick, it delivers when it comes to action or a satisfying conclusion to that action and you will definitely be entertained.So on a final note, don't get too hung up on the little details of SoaP though or you will find yourself having a much less enjoyable time as opposed to the other 95% in the theater, as Snakes On A Plane certainly has mass appeal.",Snakes on a Plane

But this film does neither. It is just a film fantastic in its simplicity. It does exactly as it says - ""Snakes On A Plane."" There are snakes, on a plane. You know what you are paying for and it delivers excellently. In ""Snakes On A Plane"" there is everything you could ever ask of any film, plus Samuel L. Jackson. Action, romance, violence, intimacy,(sometimes quite hilarious)deaths, humour, snakes and of course a plane.

Was it life-changing cinema? NO. If you expected this out of Snakes on a Plane, you probably shouldn't walk outside without adult supervision.What SoaP is, is a fun time for an hour and a half with a rowdy crowd cheering at Samuel L. Jacksons first screen appearance, and when the snakes are released (among other times). (P.S. I cant give away all of the good parts!) What I can say is, its been years since I attended a movie and heard people cheer at the screen and sincerely enjoy a movie.SoaP is just light-hearted fun. The actors were funny, the script was funny, and the movie succeeded in being a good time. You HAVE to see this movie in the theater with a rowdy group of people.

It's quick (clocking in at 106 minutes), snappy, and delivers all the great popcorn movie thrills without forcing you to think at the same time. Sam Jackson delivers a fine show hamming it up on camera and the rest of the cast is pretty good as well. I think that the new footage also helped the movie out quite a bit. It showed that SoaP wouldn't hold any punches (and, yes, there is that line everyone is waiting for).All in all, great summer entertainment.

This movie should be categorized as Comedy!And now for the straight faced review: It was horrible. There was no character development in sight and the movie was so riddled with plot holes, loose ends and half-baked ideas that one has to assume the writer was under the influence of some narcotic drug. The script was so painfully played out by some of the actors that you would imagine it was because they couldn't keep themselves from bursting out in laughter at its absurdity.Samuel Jackson acted worse than pretty much any other role he's ever played, even though it looks like the part was written for him (or at least a few 'special' lines).The snakes look like they're CG during most of the times they really were, which is OK if your movie came out in the 90s.

Normally, this would annoy me, but somehow it added to the movie greatly.This is pretty much the perfect movie. The acting is amazing, especially Samuel L Jackson, who pretty much owns the movie and the snakes. The action is great, all those ways snakes can bite, and so many ways to kill a snake. Not to mention the premise of the film and the title, which must have taken a genius to think up.This movie was the must see movie created after Jesus died.

Any film that can put itself out there with such a title has to be seen. I went to see it with 2 friends and oh my god we were blown away !! Its brilliant !! Its funny , there are moments of laughter - well for us quite a few , moments of shock , tension and sheer action ( the end !) When you define a movie from now on -Snakes on a plane will come to mind as a perfect movie as it is just pure entertainment. S.O.P is such a breath of fresh air in a sea of really poor teenager sex films and p*ss poor sequels and re-makes (which is actually where the film's strongest quality resides- its originality) The film gains much publicity from the brilliant catchphrase at the end and of course how said catchphrase came into existence. When its delivered its no anti climax , Samuel L Jackson ( on fine form) nails the line and clearly the rest of the cinema audience agreed with us as nearly everyone cheered YEAH!! Whether or not it was because such an absurd line has never been heard before in movie history matters not one bit, what matters is that this film is soo much better than anything you ll see this year , i guarantee that.The support cast were great Kenan Thompson , star of the much loved Kenan and Kel show returns and delivers ,Keith Dallas too was generally damn funny , in fact the whole cast is brilliant from the stubborn English guy to three Gs , they all simply make the film.In summary how do you define Snakes on a plane ? you cant really , I know some people who were shocked by it and didn't really see it as that funny , whereas I found it hilarious , some would say an action film , some a spoof , some a comedy - the best thing is , its all of those film genres , go see it , open your mind and enjoy it , the legendary line - ENOUGH IS ENOUGH . I HAVE HAD IT WITH THESE MOTHERF*CKING SNAKES ON THIS MOTHERF*CKING PLANE- is worth seeing alone , delivered in all its glory.Go see it so you can tell your Grandchildren , yes i saw Ol' Samuel L Jackson deliver that line.",Snakes on a Plane

It had comedic moments, action packed moments, thrilling moments, and it was well put together. On top of it all, audience participation in the theater brought everything together amazingly. If you're looking for one film to see this summer with a couple friends, you've found the right one. Samuel L. Jackson plays the perfect part of a hard-ass FBI agent that likes to have fun but takes the dangerous situation seriously. There are some comedic yet gruesome snake attacks and others that are just unexpected.

608,kar-29,A far fetched tale with no point,1,24 August 2006,"This movie is just so stupid that I cant even figure out how to describe it.Passengers were randomly killed of by being bitten by snakes in the penis, nipple, eyeball and other interesting places. Not to mention passenger being killed by having a 3 inch high heel driven into their skull through their ear. Violent death seemed to the goal itself, once the plane is eventually landed, no one seems to care about the fact that there is never given any credible answer to the main plot, and what happened to the crime boss that the whole thing was about.The flying scenes are just stupid: The captain takes a trip down into the basement (avionic bay) below the cockpit to ""fix"" the plane (this in it self stupid, because going down from the cockpit of a 747-400 will get you into the forward passenger cabin below), where he gets killed by a snake. The stupid co-pilot then happily leaves the controls to go down to have a look too  leaving the cockpit empty  give me a break. This is then repeated a couple of times as the co-pilot does not seem to think that actually flying the plane is very important. Not that they seem to be very good at flying anyway, as they seem to want to fly the most of the flight in a squall line full of active thunderstorms. Why don't studios ever call up a real pilot before writing totally unrealistic crap like this. Wievers with even a remote interest in aviation would be able to do much better.On the up side this movie is so stupid that it actually becomes quite comical at times, and I did have a few good laughs, but I am sure that it was not at the intended points.Not even Samuel L Jackson can save this one.*********AVOID AT ALL COST*********",Snakes on a Plane

To keep the action funky and cool, you have the one and only Samuel L Jackson to sound off at these riotous reptiles.

I proposed we see if there was a midnight showing of Snakes on a Plane. Even better as there was an advanced showing at 10pm. This was just the beginning of the special event that was SoaP, especially considering critics did'nt even get an advanced screening. We arrived for the previews, and you could tell the audience was rowdy and ready. No matter the preview you would hear shouts for ""Snakes"" or ""Samuel L."" Then the movie began with a cheer. The crowd was ecstatic with cheers and applause as soon as Samuel L graced the screen. Cheering, applause, and laughter were frequent and loud throughout the movie. Several times a line would be cut short from the loud crowd reaction. Then there was the guy in the front, who with every ridiculous scene or line would thrust his arms into the air above his head, as if in triumph. The fun and excitement carried the movie until the end when people cheered for minutes, many standing.

The jokes are that of adolescent boys (focussed on genitalia, anal humor and cussing). All the rest is based on stereotypes: blacks are fat rappers, blondes are dumb bitches, British are posh snobs etc. In addition to that, there is no plot whatsoever and everything is 100% predictable  except the few times you get shocked by surprisingly loud sound bursts.

Slightly Frankenstinien in it's construction, as it is at its core a ""Die Hard"" movie fused with Roger Corman-esquire fare (ala ""Tremmors"" or ""Albino Aligator"") with a liberal peppering of ""Airplane"" for good measure.The characters are all stereotypes, The plot is straight out of a 70's serial TV show and the direction is just about there.

614,leigufu,"Film to make you go ""Ewww""",10,15 January 2007,"IMHO SoaP was the best film of 2006. The idea of combining 3 of the biggest fears in the world (Fear of flying, fear of snakes, and fear of a confined space) was a brilliant idea. No matter what ANYONE says there is nothing wrong with the title ""Snakes On A Plane"" it does what it says on a tin. No one complained about the title of ""Finding Nemo"", ""SoaP"" is about snakes on a plane, ""Finding Nemo"" is about finding Nemo. The film continues to add different elements into the equation,e.g. by killing the pilot, then nearly killing the 2nd pilot and then finally killing him. The film makers did a very good job of keeping the tension and the right mood for the film.One problem with the film is...at the end we see Kenan going down the ramp, then as we watch the rest go down we can see him coming down the stairs.Anyway, I give the film 10/10 for being a brilliant idea, brilliantly made.",Snakes on a Plane

After some cliff hanging moments ,the film becomes pure comedy which helps to diffuse the tension already building up in some of us.After the movie, as i approach my car, i hear some rustling noise in the shrub close by and actually pause to ensure no snake is coming my way.......i recommend this film for boys whose new date have been giving them a tough time.You are going to cling onto yourselves at some stage during the bad portion and if you show bravery throughout,you just might improve your chances.",Snakes on a Plane
617,imdb-16753,Without Snakes?,1,25 December 2006,"The first 10 minutes of this movie was very good. I was glad to see an interesting movie for once. But then the next 80 minutes consisted entirely of snakes on a plane. This could have been a good movie if only they had shortened the snake bit to 5 minutes, and continued the story after they landed in Los Angeles. I never did figure out why so many of the passengers died instantly upon being bitten by a snake. Some of the characters on the plane had no purpose, even though they were introduced as if they would (i.e. the kick boxer on the plane did not to anything important throughout the movie. Why bother with his introduction?) Once the plane was in the air, the best part of the story was when they had to turn the air conditioning back on. My advice is to not waste your time on this movie. Even if you can watch it for free, it's not worth the time! How did this movie get such a good rating?",Snakes on a Plane

The scenario is pathetic. We have snakes that butchers people. Stupid and unoriginal characters. This movie is not a comedy nor its a horror nor its action movie. There are so many scenes that are senseless and unnecessary. Avionics is broken, hundreds of snakes, both pilots dead, pulling out from falling down, and that guy who land a plane only from his experience from a video game. It is too much. This film is not worth to see. Its wasting time. I am very sorry that i did spent my time watching this film. Besides that acting is lousy too. Not as bad as scenario but bad enough.

How can anyone be serious about this being a good movie? I got the stupid phone call from Samuel L. Jackson saying to go watch snakes on a plane and I have to admit that not only did I realize right then and there that this movie was going to blow a donkey but it was going to make me and the rest of the world fear for snakes on a plane. I mean Mr. Jackson is an alright actor but this has made his acting career stoop down along with Mr. Steven Seagal. I wonder what someone was honestly thinking when the idea was brought up. ""hey lets make a movie about snakes on a plane and have Sam Jackson star in it"".

622,RequiemForAJohn,Overrated... and not as good as it could have been,5,25 August 2006,"Anyone who's seen this movie and given it a 10 may feel good about themselves for promoting what obviously started as an underground film, but an honest look will show you that this movie is grossly overrated. Before I get labeled as someone who ""just doesn't get it"" concerning this movie, I'd like to explain what I expected: a movie with everything over-the-top: Violence, cursing, and (most importantly) Samuel L. Jackson. What I got was glimpses of the movie I expected interspersed with, unfortunately, what looked like real attempts at plot and character development. Especially painful was watching the rap star's transformation from good guy to bad and back to good again. Pointless, it added nothing to the film. What hurt the most, though, was a lack of Mr. Jackson. He was in the movie, but other than the one expected line towards the end of the film, there really wasn't anything else that was quotable in there. I thought he'd be cursing and killing snakes left and right, but by the time he finally said his ""mother *beep* snakes"" line, the audience's cheering where I watched it was half-hearted as though to say ""well, that was good, but where were all the other parts I came here to cheer for?"" Most of the ""extreme"" scenes felt forced (just think about the line from the guy who pees on the snake), while all it would have taken to make this movie awesome was to not hold back or strive for ""acting"" or ""plot"". I gave the movie a 5 because, come on, Sam Jackson is the man and, admittedly, there were some pretty damn funny parts... but I really wanted to rate this higher. The idea was great, but I didn't feel it came close to the hype. Instead, I left feeling like I'd just watched all the deleted scenes of a great movie that just didn't measure up to the finished product.",Snakes on a Plane
623,guitargod5,wow.,10,19 August 2006,"That says it. Wow. Positively the most fun that I have ever had at a movie. I must say that this is due to what I like to call the ""Walker Texas Ranger"" effect. You see, when you watch ""Walker Texas Ranger,"" you don't always watch it for the abysmal plots, the bad acting, or the all too frequent suspenseful music accompanied with the strobe camera effect; rather, you watch it because watching Chuck Norris basically beat up every cast member is AWESOME! ]That being said, we can apply this to ""Snakes on a Plane."" The title says it all. There are snakes. There is a plane. Add them together and it equals awesome! The best part is that there is no need for character development. The only character development we get is some government guy getting beaten to death followed by a plane filled with people and snakes. You could say that the movie is so bad that its good, but there may be no need to even use the word ""bad."" What we have here is a movie that is a master of the genre! This genre would include movies like Cellular, Cliffhanger, Deep Rising, etc. However, Snakes on a plane may very well be the epitome of the whole genre! Next to last would be the deaths! Some of the most hilarious ways to get killed by snakes EVER! I can only recommend you see it to understand. Finally, Samuel L. Jackson. Nothing more needs to be said here.Now, there are some inaccuracies in this movie. I am a pilot, and I could go for days about how off this movie was. However, I was having so much fun watching this movie that I personally did not care! Looking over the audience, I could see that about everyone came in with the same view of this movie. People were hollering and clapping throughout the film, and when everyone walked out of the theatre, there wasn't a single person who could be heard complaining. I think that says it all. This movie is pure fun, truly occupying a genre that many movies try to reach, but completely fail; a movie written for fun, where everyone has fun.

I was by no means one of the obsessive people about this movie, though I have been looking forward to it for a while. I went in with moderate expectations and was thoroughly surprised. It is exciting, scary, funny, and just incredibly enjoyable. It is the most fun I have had at a movie this year (and I have seen everything of value that has come out). This movie is fun and funny, without having to point out to the audience that they should be laughing at any particular scene (like, say, Napoleon Dynamite). New Line set out to create a scary, odd movie, was roped into making something campy and silly, and combined it all to make something that was just plain fun.

But the fact is, anyone that only gives this movie one star is just pretentious and boring (or just really old.) I realize that this movie was a bit corny and way over the top and just altogether far-fetched. However, where is the written rule that says that a movie can't be ridiculous and good at the same time. Some movies you simply have to judge on a different scale. While this film didn't move me and change my life, I have to say that it was definitely one of the most unbelievably entertaining films that I have ever seen. While the movie is not an outright parody of exploitive action films, there is a great deal of clever tongue in cheek comedy. In addition there is a great deal of suspense, action, gore, and over-the-top sequences that make this a unique film experience. This movie has all of the ingredients of being a revered cult classic. If you go to see this movie, let your mind open, and just be willing to be entertained.

Respect to Ellis for using those memories to such great effect.This film is fantastic in its reverent memory of those days and is brilliantly funny as the pastiche builds to a crescendo.Right from the opening credits, with totally gratuitous shots of girls on a beach, the scene is set. We are in for a fun ride through predictability of victims, over the top gore, impossible recovery and more knowing winks at the camera than you can count. The winks are not literal of course, they are the funny lines in totally inappropriate places.And as for Mr. Cool himself, he is the film. The joke is only as large as it is because it is Samuel L. Jackson having such fun with it.Bear with the slightly slow start because you are being lulled into a false sense of security, on purpose. I am still not sure whether the over the top villain and his bad acting is purposeful or not but it works.It is difficult to give too much away - there are snakes on a plane and SLJ is going to save the day, but not everyone onboard.Silliness abounds, there should be awards for the degree of silliness in fact, especially in the cockpit at the end.This is going to be a cult classic and I would be willing to bet that you will walk out of the cinema repeating over and over a particular two-word expletive with a very broad smile on your face.",Snakes on a Plane

It contained all elements of coolness and awesomeness that presaged it on the internet. Samuel L Jackson brings power and force to the screen and enlivens a story line that sounds like a kid came up with it. In fact the story line can be a beloved one because of the acting and the power of that which is Samuel L Jackson and CGI snakes. Violent deaths, nasty swollen bite things, guns, so much I cannot even name another awesome thing of the movie. You just go see it. ""If you want to live (happily) then you will do what I say.""

I did find myself laughing at the corniness in a few places, but overall it was just painful to watch! Samuel L Jackson has sold out his cool persona in the worst way possible in my opinion. He just made the film seem more out of place. I would expect an unknown lead in a film of this poor quality. The only good thing about the film was the special effects, but the fact that they involved unbelievable killer snakes took away any enjoyment of this. To top it all off, the pathetic attempt at shock factor (the snakes attacking rude or bizarre body parts) was laughable and I honestly couldn't care a less whether anyone survived.I would appreciate it if someone could explain why this was given such a high score - I imagine it must be the same people who voted for the film Gerry!",Snakes on a Plane

The ""jokes"" are so obvious and boring. The performance of a few actors is so bad. Even Jackson performs so routinely that he lost some of his glance for me. The problem is that the beginning of the movie is quite entertaining so it takes a while before you realize you're watching something which is a waste of time. But then you are already 1/3 underway so you think: why not watch the rest.

Like a good old fashioned B movie it never made it obvious it wasn't taking itself too seriously. As a result it was hilarious. The plot does actually start in a pretty vicious way, so that you begin with something purporting to be pretty serious. But by the end you know you're watching something in a genre of very gentle self-parody. It's also a parody of disaster movies in general. Quite a contrast to Flight Plan - out the same season. The latter is the opposite: so serious in such an utterly implausible plot that it just looks ridiculous. This, by contrast, is immensely enjoyable, with some good performances by the cast.

Jackson like back to his roots in Pulp Fiction, but that was intended and added on to the humor in the movie. The gore was not very strong, the reason it was rated R was because there is a sex scene.

I even went to bed very late after the first 10 o'clock showing, got up for work very early, and felt more refreshed than I ever have before. Yes, Snakes on a Plane is so good, it even provides the body with miraculous health benefits.The movie itself is ridiculously ingenious on every level. From top-notch acting, jaw-dropping special effects, and a heartbreakingly beautiful score, Snakes on a Plane has it all. I won't go into specifics, so as to not ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it, but the first two snake attacks are the two greatest single movie scenes in film history, and will no doubt leave you and every single person in the audience yelling, laughing and in a general state of euphoria. The only downside comes from the fact that it is impossible to even hear 75% of the good lines Samuel says, because the audience is causing such an uproar, but hey, isn't that why you came to see the movie in the first place? Never again will another movie create such a buzz and atmosphere that can produce an opening night that is full of a wide variety of people (at least at the theater I went to) who can get together, yell at the screen, throw snakes at the audience, and laugh when someone gets bitten in the eye by a viper.",Snakes on a Plane

We are well aware it is fantastically idiotic!,6,19 August 2006,"I'll just go ahead and state the obvious: If it weren't for the title of this film, there would really be no compelling reason to see it. Sure, it's intermittently entertaining, but in the end, it's utterly forgettable.The movie aggressively attempts to let the audience know that the filmmakers are very much in on the joke. ""Yes! We get it!"" it seems to shout. ""We know this is an extremely ridiculous concept for a movie! Please, join us in the amusement, won't you?"" Ultimately, the film suffers because of this. Too many half-assed attempts to inject humor into the script. Most of the jokes seem to have been ""borrowed"" from other movies (Suck the snake venom out of his butt?! Hilarious! That guffaw-inducing scenario just gets funnier every time it unfolds since its inception in one of the City Slickers movies over a DOZEN years ago!). The film would ultimately have been better served if the director had omitted about 75% of the intentional comedy and just left it to the insanity of the plot to create the laughter.Sam Jackson, if you ask me, phoned in his performance at points. Some of his facial expressions, specifically during his time on screen with Kenan Thompson, are inspired, but his character was kind of bland otherwise. Thompson on the other hand was by far the most enjoyable person to watch. He seemed to be enjoying himself on the set.A quick review of the CGI: It was cheesy looking. Not much to be done about this, just wished the snakes looked a bit more real. I want to be CONVINCED that naked man in the bathroom has an actual snake stuck to his face. And about the music video in the credits: Perhaps the most horrendous thing I have ever witnessed. It's an insipid tune with some of the weakest lyrics I've ever heard. Also, the girl in the band seems to have misplaced about 30 pounds of much-needed body mass. I hope you find it! You're going to need it one day.Honestly, I was vaguely annoyed halfway through that I still had over 45 more minutes to sit through, but the final sequence of events kept me entertained enough. If you must go see this movie to feel hip, I suppose there's no harm. Go ahead, join the in-crowd. It'll help you answer Trivial Pursuit questions in about 10 years.",Snakes on a Plane

Most movies I've seen lately, good and bad, are missing something. I mean, even the good ones, it's like they either take themselves too seriously or try too hard. The most I usually get from any movie I see is a few chuckles (maybe more if I'm really lucky), and that's it. I wouldn't classify any movie I've seen in a theater in the last two years or more as a ""feel-good"" movie; even with awesome action and great dialogue, they all leave me feeling different degrees of dead inside when I leave.Then I saw ""Snakes on a Plane"".This movie was HILARIOUS!! The over-the-top nature, the char-actors, the fact that, come on, how likely is this to ever happen in real life? Once the aforementioned snakes are loose, it's all over-you stop paying attention to story development, character development, all you care about is when the next slithery reptile attacks someone. Speaking of which, there were certain parts (that you'll have to see for yourself) where I couldn't not laugh (and I wasn't alone). And when Sam Jackson delivered the famous line, the whole theater I was in erupted with laughter. And when I left that theater, I felt better than I had from ANY movie in recent memory. Suddenly, all my problems seemed not that big anymore. I can't think of another movie that's had that kind of effect on me.In closing, I went in just to see what all the fuss was about, expecting another so-bad-it's-good movie (*cough* Showgirls *cough*) and came out glad I'd taken such a chance.

There was enough tongue in cheek humor in this film to make it a very entertaining movie experience; if they had made the mistake of handling it seriously then it would have truly been a painful viewing experience. However, the overall mood was tongue in cheek, effectively balanced with cheap shocks and genuine gross out moments.All in all, I highly recommend this for the no-brainer popcorn flick it is (provided you don't have a serious fear of snakes).

Take for example, Superman Returns, X-Men: 3, and Snakes On A Plane - all three of these movies were over-hyped to such an extent that the hype was greater than the movie - except for Snakes On A Plane, based on the very premise of hype. The trailers were souped up, the characters over-the-edge, and the premise downright silly - this played well for the movie.A lot of people don't understand the brilliance in this movie - the plot is stupid, at best. I mean, come on : releasing snakes on an airplane? Give me a break! But this is exactly how it works - a few people come along, come up with a ridiculous plot line, create some extremely hardcore and downright stereotyped characters, and throw them on an airplane, and what do you have? Gold.Personally, when I saw the first trailer, I looked to my pal and said ""Uh, alright... so I don't think I need to see this movie."" - the whole plot was explained in the title : There are snakes, on a plane. An over the top and super psyched Samuel L. ""Generic Cop"" Jackson goes and saves everyone, while stock characters (including the ""last day on the job"" hero, who happens to be an independent flight attendant, the flight attendant who has a definite appearance of homosexuality, the hardcore rapper who is really a bit of a wuss, and the devoted video gamer who treats life like a video game) react in horror and come out as heroes themselves at various moments.For a movie itself, Snakes on a Plane isn't as good as I've claimed. For a movie with its intentions, that is, to point out how much hype blockbuster films receive (look at MI:3 - yawn), by taking a ridiculous premise and overloading it with special effects and the rest of the things you see in movies like MI:3, it is a cinematic masterpiece.",Snakes on a Plane
646,gundar79,Two Hours of Crap-Fest!!!,2,5 September 2006,"What the hell is wrong with these kids? How the hell did this crap get so many '10's??? I thought IMDb was a respectable site and always thought that most users knew about good movies... but this garbage? Sure, movie's not suppose to be serious, but come on... this is some serious non-sense. Weak plot, bad acting, BAD CGI, and total-non-stop-non-sense! Yeah, Playstation 2 made that black kid learn how to fly an airplane... with a perfect landing! All the main characters get a date with flight attendants.. there's a big freakin hole on a plane..and nothing happens! BAD sophomoric humor throughout the movie and it was anything but, humorous. I can't say enough bad things about this movie. This movie was made for Grand Theft Auto generation and I'm sure they all scored this crap 10. By far the worst movie I've seen in the last 10 years, up there with 13 Ghosts.",Snakes on a Plane
647,nauti_ger,Excellent B-grade movie,8,23 September 2007,"The title says it all - its about snakes on a plane and is strictly B-grade. The film boasts nothing so watch it without expecting anything and you'll be in for a thrill ride of your life. I enjoy gory horror flicks on zombies and the like, hence 'Snakes' is clearly my cup of tea. The plot may not be the most airtight, so do not bother to spend time wondering logically how the snakes could have gotten onto the plane. But it is the execution of the film that is great. The snakes look very real and the deaths on each of the victims are carried out with precision and variety. One woman making out with her boyfriend gets bitten on her breasts, another fat lady gets her eye eaten out and a man gets constricted and almost half-swallowed by an anaconda-like huge snake. Its precisely this unabashed embracing of horror and gore that makes this film so enjoyable. Definitely not for the faint-hearted and those expecting Oscar type performances.",Snakes on a Plane
648,dracuella,Probably one of the worst films I've seen ever,1,9 July 2007,"I am generally quite easy to please film-wise. I didn't leave the theater when I went and saw Scream, I found good parts in Resident Evil and I even enjoyed Doom. I can see past bad acting and serious lacks of story if only there's a good feel to a film. But this.. I must say I was so disappointed by this film that I wanted to turn it off about halfway into it. Don't get me wrong, the actors actually do quite good jobs (mostly) and the general tone of the film is all right but then the snakes appear. Snakes attacking people because of pheromones? And not just attacking, STALKING?! What the hell? And then there was the ridiculous idea of having the snake attack the lovers in the toilet, biting her naked nipple. Or another toilet visiting man's penis while he screams for it to get of his dick? Or a passengers EYE? Come ON! This is ludicrous. Using 'effects' like these went out of film-making in the 70s as people developed a sense of taste and criticism. I couldn't even smile at the idea of snakes going amok at people, that's how embarrassing it was. If you're into toe-curling and lameness, go ahead. Otherwise say well away from this film",Snakes on a Plane
649,davem_04,Quite possibly the best film ever made,10,19 August 2006,"Okay maybe not, but if you take it for what it is, it's an enjoyable disaster flick. Here is a list of things that make this a movie a good time:1- Snakes (they're scary and create suspense when you see them about to bite someone)2- A plane in bad weather that's going crazy, also good for suspense.3- You see gratuitous nudity in the first third of the movie (big jugs).4- ""WHAMMY!"" from Anchorman is in it, and he says funny lines.5- SAMUEL L. JACKSON IS THE STAR (quite possibly the greatest actor of his generation)6- Samuel L. Jackson says the following: ""I've had enough! I'm tired of these motherf#ckin snakes, on this motherf#ckin' plane!""The best part is that he pretty much says the line for no reason at an awkward stage of the movie. For that reason alone, everyone should see this film: children, adults, teens, the elderly, everybody. Hell, it's the reason I went to see it.So in conclusion, if you like to watch scary slithering snakes and Sam Jackson in the same place, GO SEE THIS MOVIE TWICE OR MORE!",Snakes on a Plane
650,Discoyoda,This aims to please,10,22 August 2006,"This movie surprised royally i thought it looked funny so i saw it but it is so much more than that its like an homage to the old drive in horror movies and i am looking forward to seeing it again. You have no idea how satisfying the famous line is until you hear it. The action is actually very well done,the jump scares are very intense. Some of the dialogue in this movie just cracked me up (in a good way), and sometime i got to say i felt the pain of certain passengers when they were bitten in certain places.This isn't really a spoiler but stay after the movie finishes something very entertaining pops up for your viewing pleasure. It's a shame this movie didn't make as much money as it should have but that doesn't change the fact that this movie rocks. Don't even think see this movie now if you haven't already!",Snakes on a Plane
651,moviemaster77-1,not as stupid as everyone thinks its going to be...this movie rox!,10,17 August 2006,"yeah OK so i was looking forward to this movie...i wasn't a HUGE fanboy of it but i did want to see it. i had heard both sides of the scale on y ppl thought it was gonna b bad and y they thought it was gonna b good. i went in expecting a campy stupid movie but to have a good time. well i had a great time but this was not in any way a stupid movie. like seriously OK it was kinda campy but not in the way that everybody expects. it has a plot and actually has some character development in the first 30 mins of the movie. i loved it. this is the summer popcorn movie I've been waiting for! will it win Oscars? no. but it will win over the hearts of many ppl and it is definitely one of my faves now. this film knows what it is and it accomplishes that in every shape, way, and form. bravo to this film for not letting its fans down and hopefully it will make a few converts. : )",Snakes on a Plane
652,staindslaved,One of the Greatest B - Movies ever dreamed up,7,23 August 2006,"The true beauty of Snakes on a Plane goes no farther than the marketing of the film needed to go, it's right there in the title.Most low grade horror, comedy or thriller movies try to disguise there concept under paper thin plots or predictable step by step character development when all people want are some comedic deaths or chilling moments. Snakes on a Plane is a movie that decided to discard it's movie mask and let the world see it for what it is, a movie about snakes on a plane. No one watched movies like Friday the 13th, or A Nightmare On Elm Street for any other reason then to see people killed in horrific and often comical ways and ""snakes"" lets you know right from the beginning just what it is.The genius behind this movie is that the obviousness of its title frees it of any responsibilities to develop plots, themes or characters and can go right to the purpose of the film almost immediately. A few introductions to the main characters and then all the victims who will get a little screen time later and then let loose the snakes and watch the fun. The movie understands how humorous and enjoyable it's concept is that they even have a countdown to when the snakes are released to build up the excitement.A easily watchable, veteran actor in Samuel L. Jackson gives snakes a sturdy hero to cheer for in a most horrifying and ridiculous situation to help move the story from snake attack to snake attack, and the movie probably wouldn't have worked without him.The Snakes were an excellent threat as the animals themselves can slither around and coil up, so that the entire audience can build up tension as they all know what is coming up, and strike rapidly giving that excellent jump or scream followed by cheers or laughter. The snake attack scenes are the highlight to the film (Oh boy the places I'd never think to get bitten but am now terrified of), second only to Samuel L. Jackson's infamous line ""I Have had it with these motherF*&^ing snakes on this motherF&^*ing plane."" The movie is easily watchable and easily enjoyable but what makes this movie a step up on almost all other B-movies is that no one can watch the film and be disappointed. It's called Snakes on a Plane, if you think you'd enjoy watching snakes attack people on a plane then you'll enjoy it. If you don't then you won't, so there's no need to watch it and especially no need to dislike the movie because the title and plot can no way bait or deceive you into watching it if you have no interest.Samuel L. Jackson signed on based on the title of the movie alone and so should anyone else. If you find the title stupid or corny then that's how you'll find the movie. If you find it funny and exciting then slip in that DVD (when it come out of course), pop some popcorn and gather your friends because your in for a thrill ride full of...well what else SNAKES ON A MOTHERF&^ING PLANE!!!",Snakes on a Plane
653,Longinus905,"Excellent, but make sure you know what your in for.",9,17 August 2006,"Snakes on a plane is the kind of movie that you go to with friends. You watch it with three or more friends and make sure that you don't expect it to be serious, or to make jokes. You are there to see the movie because it is so incredibly bad that every moment is comedy. The Directors accepted that, and went along with the fact that the movie is terrible that they could never do anything serious with it. Instead they made it so terribly bad that its enjoyable. So don't go see this movie expecting a cinematic masterpiece, go see this movie expecting something that has a good sense of humor about itself, and make sure you have friends with you to laugh right alongside you.",Snakes on a Plane
654,curelover,AWESOME! So Terrifying!,10,18 August 2006,"This movie was nonstop!!! The set-up is quick, so we get to the plane in record time, however there is enough character development so you can get to know your fellow passengers (so to speak). They also don't waste much time getting to the snakes, which is where the fun begins!!!! Oh my gosh, so terrifying! Snakes, snakes, biting everyone, everywhere! This is just the height of fun movies! Everything is better than expected, the acting was just campy enough without being too campy. All the people you want to die, do. Some you don't want to die, do. There is tension, comic moments, action, flamethrowing, hatcheting, broken bottle stabbing, microwaving! You name it! And the snakes get their job done well, also. Such a great piece of wild ride cinema! My heart was racing when it was over! WELL WORTH THE PRICE, this is one you've got to see in the theater, as the experience is part of the fun!",Snakes on a Plane
655,dossadam,Tremendous Achievement,10,17 August 2006,"This movie is one of the best things to happen to cinema this year. I must say, I got exactly what I expected and more from this movie: great action and great laughs. While I do think that the book is probably better (novelization by Christ Faust) the movie does a great job with its timing for humor and for jumps. Also, there are just some things that you need to hear from Samuel L. Jackson. David Koechner fits the role of the chauvinistic pilot, Rick, perfectly. Eddie Kim wasn't portrayed particularly well, nor was Sean (the protected witness), but despite their importance to the plot, these are fairly minor setbacks. This movie is excellent, but I'm not going to try to tell you that it's plot driven. The beauty of this movie is that anyone who hears the title of this movie and is still at all curious to see it will not be disappointed.",Snakes on a Plane
656,supergirlfootballer,My opinion of the movie!,9,24 December 2006,"Snakes On A Plane was one of those films that was so bad, it was actually really amazingly good! There's a lot of cheesy phrases, predictable lines and a fairly stupid plot but if you don't take these too seriously, like the film obviously doesn't, then you will enjoy the film immensely! I came out of the cinema beaming with delight, i'd enjoyed it so much! The Cobra Starship song at the end of the film is a highlight of the film, outrageously corny but it will stick in your head very easily, and adds to the film's overall tongue-in-cheek approach to the action genre. Samuel L Jackson is great in the film, playing a typical 'cop', but he acts along with the tongue-in-cheek-ness of the film. Overall, it's an amazing film, sure to entertain you for a spare couple of hours! Go and rent/buy it on DVD - you won't regret it! x Amy x",Snakes on a Plane
657,lizard_man,The year's unexpected delight,10,19 August 2006,"Walking into the theater to see Snakes on a Plane was pretty interesting. When I first heard of it back in January, there was precious little pushing me to see it. Somehow, however, the title stuck with me. All of the internet buzz began to sink in after eight months and I became filled with hopeful enthusiasm that a hokey horror flick was just what I needed to remedy all of the ultra-seriousness my tastes in movies often brings me into contact with. After finding out that screenings for critics were canceled my heart sank a little bit. My expectations weren't very high to start, but the mark of a true dud is absence. Regardless, opening day has proved to be a surprise treat and I'm glad to waste my time to write about it. Come the Oscars 2007 Snakes on A Plane will win Best Picture. It'll win Best Director, Screenplay, Actor, Documentary and Animated Feature. Even if I'm betting against weighted dice when I boast about the success of a film in late August, Snakes on a Plane is worth that gamble. It's a witty bit of horror ecstasy interwoven with great enough entertainment to rival the likes of Jaws or Dawn of the Dead.If it wasn't for the playful title fade-in I probably would have been tricked into thinking what I was watching was the wrong film. The plot is about a young man named Sean Jones on vacation in Hawaii. He surfs, rides his bike and undoubtedly has a chance to gawk at some pretty ass, all against the backdrop of some cheerful island music. That all changes when he stumbles onto the sight of a MIP (that's murder in progress for those that aren't ""down"" with my slang) by an Asian crime lord and escapes with his life. In order to testify against him, Sean and his assigned guardian, Nelville Flynn, must leave Hawaii for Los Angeles at once. This doesn't go down all that well with the leading suspect, and in order to prevent Sean from testifying he has his men load the plane with dozens of highly aggressive and potent snakes. Somehow, he's smart enough to get such a hefty cargo past the guards but it never occurs to him that simply messing with the plane's controls or wiring would guarantee a more assured kill.Understandably, nobody who cherishes their family wants to work with live rattlesnakes or cobras, so digital effects are used to portray the animals instead. That seems the limp leg this movie walks with. No amount of bite marks or afflictions will ever convince the audience that the snakes on the screen are real, but now that I have had time to reflect it seems that the joke is on us and that the bogus CGI is all a clever spoof targeting the slithering parade of poorly rendered beasts that sci-fi channel bombards us with every other month. In a flick bold enough to fly with such an obvious title, and send-up its own leading performer's character traits (""I've had it with these mother f**king snakes on this mother f**king plane!"") it wouldn't surprise me.None of the actors here are on a business trip, either. Everyone plays their part well, especially Jackson who seems to have a lot fun with his role as FBI agent Nelville Flynn. It's good for him and entertaining for us because he's a man who lives for these parts (Pulp Fiction and Freedomland, anyone?), and acting them out is simply a walk around the curve with plenty of freedom to do what he wants. Is that a smile I sense under his frown? Sean Jones, the vital witness to a gruesome murder played by Nathan Phillips, doesn't get as much screen time as I hoped but then again his name isn't Samuel L. Jackson. It's more of a pet peeve than an honest criticism and at least he's there when we need him.Every other passenger, crew member or pilot on the plane is a character with their own background. It was interesting to see them introduced. We learn that one man is scared of flying, and we find out he's just been married and is returning from the honeymoon. Another character (played by Julianna Margulies) is a flight attendant on her last outing, and after that she becomes a lawyer. The stakes are raised because they all have something to lose, and considering that most of them get less than five minutes of screen time, that's a remarkable achievement. This all happens before the plane leaves the ground, when everyone is still in the waiting room, sitting tightly in their chairs and conversing with one another like they're waiting for a movie to start. We don't hate any of the characters. They're a part of the audience. Nobody wants to see them die, and the fact that it happens (a lot) draws an atypical somber tone to the film.There's genuine magic here behind the terror, and it isn't in gritty cinematography, exceptional effects or fountains of blood. It's not even the snakes themselves. It's the writing and the characters, the movie's ability to turn the most humorous moments into the most frightening with the blink of an eye, and visa-versa. The moment the snakes are released the plane becomes a flying haunted house, and our folks are trapped inside with no way out.Enjoy the flight. Snakes on a Plane is one for the ages.",Snakes on a Plane
658,twodollarpanda,Worth Every Penny.,10,20 August 2006,"I am glad that I paid my hard earned dollars to see this wonderful work of art. It is not just quite possibly the best motion picture ever made, it is the best motion picture ever made. Ever.No, Snakes on a Plane will not make you question your place in the universe, it will not compel you to reach out to people across the earth, but it will deliver the most absurd 105 min you have ever experienced in a very long time, and are going to experience in a very long time.This film is a must see for everyone. It has it all, a relentless mob boss, snakes, a plane, horrible weather, hysterical passengers, a nude scene, snakes wreaking havoc on hysterical passengers, stereotypical cheesy lines, and of course, SAMUEL L JACKSON. If you do not like this film then you are missing the point of life. It is not serious, nor thrilling, or scary, but it never meant to be. It meant to be the most over the top, funny, ridiculous, movie about snakes on a plane, and that's exactly what it is. It met every one of my expectations and even exceeded them.Be sure to bring as many people as possible and be prepared to laugh. Be prepared to clap and scream throughout the entire film, especially for Samuel L Jackson's stunning performance. Having the entire audience applaud for Jackson's highly anticipated line only adds to the awesomeness of this film. If you get the chance, get more friends and see it again.That's all I have to say.",Snakes on a Plane
659,oedekerk,Cutting Open a Little Boy's Arm: A Recap of Snakes on a Plane,10,18 August 2006,"I felt a little fluttered when I left the theater after enduring the Flight of the Snakes of Foreign Origins. Then I realized, I am truly astounded by what I just witnessed. Did my little virgin eyes just see a python chomp on a man's Wang? Is that woman foaming at the mouth because a snake just sunk a load of venom into her tongue? Well hump me with a harpoon, the Mile High Club just lost some teats! Here are the emotions I went through: Holy crap HAHA! (The titles fading in while Jack Johnson plays in the background), What DA fudge! (a little kid getting bit), Holy crap HAHA! (Sammy J. chucking' a snake away from his partner), What DA fudge! (a boa constrictor breaking the bones of some English dude before devouring him)...and the cycle continued until the end.My English teacher once said ""I hate my bastard students""...but she also said ""the most important thing in a movie is the ending""...and boy does this movie carry it home.It happens in the span of like 2 seconds...a snake pops up, jumps at the witness, S. Jackson pumps a few rounds into the witness, then the witness falls off the plane. To the idiotic movie goer, this would be too fast, and they would say ""Daa, did Neville just shoot that guy?"" and you'd said ""No you butt-hole, a snake just jumped on the witness and Samuel L. just shot that B, PA-KOW mother-trucker!"" But leave your lazy-ass friends at home to watch Matlock, because Snakes on a Plane is fast, aggressive, and so potent, that your girlfriends and mothers would probably get pregnant with little snake babies.",Snakes on a Plane
660,omgraae,Braindead snakemovie,6,7 April 2007,"Watching this movie left me mildly amused. Samuel L. Jackson in a monster-movie sounded intriguing, but I was quickly disappointed at the poor screenplay. This movie tries to be funny I think - but I am not really sure... At any rate this movie both fails to be really funny or really serious. A bland feeling of neither-or.I would prefer Eight Legged Freaks over this piece of ... movie anytime. Although I can see how this movie could be really scared to someone with phobias towards flying/confined spaces/snakes/Samuel L Jackson. If you just want so see something less-than-serious with your firends and/or a keg of beer I can recommend this movie - IF you already saw the aforementioned movie and all the good movies at the video-shop.",Snakes on a Plane
661,ashpolt,"Not a film, an event.",10,21 August 2006,"In case you hadn't gathered already, there's one important thing about this film: if you're the kind of person who enjoys films because of their masterful use of colour, multiple intertwined plot lines, visionary directing and amazing imagery - and more importantly, enjoys ONLY those kind of films - don't bother seeing Snakes on a Plane.For those of you who remember that films are supposed to be fun, read on.To enjoy Snakes on a Plane, you have to ""get it."" If you go into the cinema looking to analyse it, you're already not getting it. If you go in looking to be challenged, you don't get it. If you go in wanting a revealing critique on the changing morality of our times, you don't get it. Already, days after the release of this film, people are criticising it for not being realistic, for having bad special effects or whatever - they don't get it. They're doing the film equivalent of going into KFC and asking for steak - they won't get it, and they won't be satisfied with what they do get, but crucially, that doesn't mean what they're getting is bad.Don't get me wrong, I appreciate a deep, meaningful film as much as the next man, if not more, but (can you tell what I'm going to say next?) that's not what Snakes on a Plane is all about, and to criticise it for not offering that is to miss the point entirely. If you go into the cinema with an open mind, looking for nothing more than some serious snakes on a plane, you'll get exactly that, and you'll have a whole lot of fun in the process.I've seen a lot of good films in the cinema in my time, many of them better films (in an artistic sense) than Snakes on a Plane, but never - never - have I had more fun in the cinema than watching this film. The entire audience was hanging on every word Samuel L. Jackson said, and there was cheering when the immortal line eventually came - when was the last time you heard cheering in a cinema? This is, as far as I'm concerned, exactly what the movie industry needed: a reminder that not every film need to be buried underneath piles of pretentiousness thinly disguised as depth, and that sometimes the greatest pleasures in life are the simplest ones.Simply, the most enjoyable film I've seen in a long time, and an experience I'll be having again very soon. Masterful!",Snakes on a Plane

The lines are classic, though they are trying to be serious, and I find it hard to believe that anyone could not laugh at some point in that film. Yes the deaths are gretuitous - but they use every cliché in the book and it makes it very enjoyable. Its stupid. Its not scary at all. Its dumb. Its got Sam Jackson in yet another similar role but it is brilliant. It is also set on a plane which appears to be bigger than an Airbus A380. Its factually totally incorrect. You have to see it to believe it.Its scary to think that this could be the biggest movie of 2006....WHAMMY!",Snakes on a Plane

This is one of those rare movies that is made to be seen in a packed house, with people laughing and screaming at the screen, and where one feels compelled to join in doing it. It almost reminded me of a ""Rocky Horror"" type experience. This movie doesn't bore with any damned ""plot"" details, and just dives right in. Non-stop laughs,scares,gore,and action is the order of the day. Acting ranges from good(Jackson and Margulies) to not so good, like that matters anyway. A great time to be sure.

664,dpartn,"Not that bad,,,,,",8,2 September 2006,"Brian Dipo's comments not withstanding, I found this movie quite amusing. That is what they wanted it to be. Silly action. If some reviewers want to complain about the lack of credibility in the film then they are on the wrong track to begin with. Camp and many B movies in general can be a blessing. I did find Wrath of Kahn amusing. Bill Shatner is classic in it. But as you may know, Bill Shatner also made another film called Kingdom of The Spiders. You remember, tarantulas spinning webs over the entire town. lol! Even had some spiders on a plane in it. Point being is SOAP was clearly effective at being what it intended to be. i think it's great that a major studio would put out something like this. The only thing better would have been for it to be an actual sequel to the Airport movies. Wheel out Charlton Heston and George Kennedy while they are at it! As far as mainstream culture and internet culture are concerned, I think there's less of a difference than some think. except perhaps mainstream culture obviously finds a no talent actor like Jim Carey entertaining. I would find it torture to have to sit through one of his films.I enjoy a quality film when i can see one. Something like Vertigo or Bogart's The Big Sleep are hard to beat. But these days you on't get the same quality. I am thrilled to be able to see a film like SOAP come out. The other poster made a comment about the excess CGI effects. well, hmmm, seems the only alternative for this film's concept to work would have been turning Real deadly snakes loose on the actors for that added realism the poster was missing. I think the actors and insurance company might have had a tiny issue with that option. This was a fine film as long as your obviously aware it wasn't intended to be a in depth thriller with huge plot. Uh, the title should have suggested that.",Snakes on a Plane
665,tash479,I'm tired of these mutha#%@& snakes on this mutha#$%@& plane!!!!!!,9,19 August 2006,"OK so I have been wanting to see this movie ever since I got my copy of Entertainment Weekly 2 weeks ago. I had randomly been seeing the title around the internet but hadn't been paying much attention. I have a weekly movie club that I'm involved in and the other main participant didn't want to see it so I was on my on, or so I thought. When I got there a couple of other folks from work were there so I had folks to sit with. This movie did not disappoint at all. First of all, people that didn't want to see it because they don't like snakes...hello like 99% of the population doesn't like snakes. Its all about the fear factor for me. Not much can scare me in the way of movies, probably as a result of seeing Gremlins at a young age, but snakes are one of those things that make you just cringe at some unconscious (and conscious) level. And seeing snakes attack and in very uncomfortable places is an eye opening and closing experience. The second, reason for wanting to see it was of course the ever prolific Sam Jackson. I've been so in love with this man's acting ever since Pulp Fiction that even in some ripe movies he's done the acting was still a thing of beauty. The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10 was for the brief bad acting in the opening scene from the bad guys. Can we say acting school? And I love the name. As Sam Jackson said it reaches out and grabs you and lets you know your in for a good time. Pacific Flight 121 wasn't cutting it.",Snakes on a Plane
666,mythrilnazgul,Everything I imagined plus more,10,18 August 2006,"First off, this movie will not appeal to everyone. There will always be a few people who walk out of this disappointed. That's a shame.I saw the 10 pm screening on the 17th. The theater was moderately filled, but EVERYONE had a good time. There was cheering, clapping, roaring laughter, screaming - I haven't seen this much audience participation in YEARS. Every single person left the theater in a good mood. That's something very few movies can do.Perhaps this is nothing more than a glorified B-movie. I beg to differ. Even out of the context of which Snakes on a Plane made it's debut - take away all the internet hype, the fanatic fans, the t-shirts and posters, the personalized Sam Jackson voice mail messages, take away all of that - it was good. At the end of the day, you still have a very decent action comedy with some fine acting from Jackson and others. Sure, it follows a lot of the action genres clichés, but it WORKED and it worked so well. It's almost as if the filmmakers made this SPECIFICALLY for the audience.That's it. Snakes on a Plane is the ultimate fan film. It's a movie made for US. The internet fans, the people who latched on to the film's no hold's barred advertising, the B-horror movie lovers, the Sam Jackson lovers (oh, and Sam is everything we wanted him to be in this movie, for sure). Snakes has belly laughs, sadistic action (be forewarned, some of the deaths are VERY gruesome), overall badassery, and a metric ton of killer snakes to boot.This is what a movie should be. Fun, enjoyable, gripping. I can't think of any movie I've seen this year that has had me as excited and happy coming out as when I went in (last one I recall was Batman Begins). This will become a classic, our Army of Darkness - and it deserves every inch of respect, every penny it gets.Thank you for making movies fun again.",Snakes on a Plane
667,mastonae1,Snakes on a Plane rocked my world,10,18 August 2006,"I must admit, I was very skeptical. I saw the reviews on multiple websites, read the threads on IMDb, and saw the votes. The general consensus among professional movie raters is that there was no consensus. Well, the people have spoken and they loved it. More importantly, I loved it.The audience laughed, cheered, and screamed. I have never been so entertained at the movies. This wasn't just a movie, it was an event. This reaction I have to it is very fresh, the movie let out 15 minutes ago. I highly recommend this movie. No, it will not change your life or make you rethink everything you stand for. This is not Crash, it will not win an academy award for best picture. But if there was an award for being the Most Kick Ass Film, this would win. This is the epitome of the mindless non-stop action thriller. Go see this movie, but for god's sake, have the right attitude before you go see it. This isn't A Beautiful Mind, although I'm sure Russell Crowe wouldn't have minded bashing a few snakes with a telephone.",Snakes on a Plane
668,barryi,Wow.........horrible...spoilers,2,23 August 2006,"This was honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen....I will not say it is THE worst, From Justin to Kelly will always top that one. This movie was mindboggling bad though. So the beginning isn't too bad, they do a nice job putting the idea of why the main guy(forgot his name) has to go on the plane and take up the entire first class. This movie had potential to be a good/decent movie, but it almost turned into a comedy at certain points. So the acting is mediocre in the first place, and then when the snakes start attacking the people, it isn't scary, it is just downright hilarious. I mean, when this couple is having sex in the bathroom, of course the snake is going to bite her nipple instead of any other part of her body....right? There weren't many people in the theater, but everybody there was just laughing, it was so bad. Then the 2nd snake attack was even better. So a different guy goes to the bathroom, and of course the snake bits his penis........and the guy dies, everybody was laughing really hard then, it was hilarious, and just downright stupid.So then the rest of the snakes attack the people which I'll admit was somewhat interesting, even though the acting was awful. But parts of it didn't make since. If the people are all scared of these aggressive snakes, why wouldn't they fight them off after being attacked for the first 10 minutes, and why would only the people who get bit are people that we've met maybe once. And then when the plane is crashing, who wouldn't predict that they'd be at like 10 feet above sea level, and then they'd figure out how to work the plane and bring the plane back up into the sky. Also, when Samuel Jackson shoots the window, who would really expect EVERYBODY to be able to hold on....I mean c'mon.Overall, just a horrible movie.",Snakes on a Plane

Rumour has it that people have known about this film since long before any advertising or trailers or anything like that. I totally respect and encourage that type of strong underground following. I went to the theatre just to laugh at it with everyone else. The acting is not very believable and the special effects are not very convincing for the most part but everybody already knows that!! The whole theatre was cheering and laughing and having a good time. They were all there to just celebrate the absurdity of it all, So in that respect the film was excellent.If you are into these goofy types of movies I would strongly recommend Cabin Fever and Boa vs Python.",Snakes on a Plane

I found the movie to be incredibly funny and very entertaining. I saw it at my work at a 10 O'clock Showing and it was a great time. The movie starts a little bit slow, but after they get on the plane it is non-stop Action/Comedy/Thriller Fun. This movie will Truly Entertain anybody and everybody who watches it. See it with your friends or girlfriends and you are sure to have a great time. There are several Great one liners That everybody will laugh at.

I was fearful that I was setting myself up for disappointment, because the whole thing was pure hype. But... no. A lot of films disappoint you, this just didn't. If anything, the hype made the film. So did the audience. See it with SoaP nerds, a theatre full of them. If you think it's dumb, likely your mind already made up. You won't like it. if you see it alone, you won't like it. If you see it with others who think it's dumb, you won't like it. This is literally a party movie, if there ever was one. There's only one way to see it properly, so take the chance.I really can't do a review for this film. And neither can anyone. It's not that type of movie. You can sit down and criticize every aspect of film-making, acting, or technical aspects... but who the hell would do that with something like this?

Samuel L Jackson doesn't exactly need to stretch his acting talents too much to get through this movie, but he does a fine enough job. And some wicked one-liners. This is not high culture. This is not food for thought (well, I hope not). It is just plain good fun (as long as you don't have a phobia of snakes, that is).I haven't had so much fun watching a movie in ages. It doesn't take itself too seriously and just takes you for a mad ride, full of hilarious one-dimensional characters... and lots of vicious snakes. An absolute hoot. Go and see it on a weekend late show in a packed cinema and you'll have a grand night out. Oh, and bring some plastic snakes.

Snakes don't attack people for fun, they attack 'prey', kill it with their venom or strangle it, wait for it to die, then swallow it and then they go to digest their prey for a week or more... The way they behave in this movie is really stupid, they roar like lions, make even more silly other noises and bite like drugged dogs with rabies... Also, snakes don't bite holes in people to enter their bodies... This movie is just so stupid and unrealistic, what a waste of time and money!!!

This year we have seen some stinkers but my god this film takes the biscuit.......IT IS BRUTAL, END OF STORY!I used to like IMDb (back in the day) when it got legitimate reviews on films by semi-intelligent people but now it's subjected to some seriously dodgy and misleading information. Me thinks ol' Hollywood is paying people to do sparkling reviews on their films. ""PARONOYA"" I hear you cry but why would some one give a film like Snake on a Plane 10stars there is no way this could be 10stars. Even if you never saw a film before and had nothing else on which to base your score you could not take this film seriously enough for 10stars, you would just know there would have to be better films. Ridiculous comments like the one from Jawschlech with the heading ""there is nothing bad about this movie"". Now read through his (Jawschlech's) comment..paragraph 2first line.. ""this is bad"". Its people like you Mr. Jawschlech that are responsible for the state of films today. The film industry has it too easy these days cos of the likes of you.make them work for their money. The film industry just keeps the rubbish coming and we keep paying thinking that it may be OK.

Since most people knew certain quotes and other things about the movie it became almost like a Rocky horror picture show. People would shout out comments and sidelines that really added to the fun of the movie. When I was watching it I really felt like I was part of the movie. Not only was the experience overall enjoyable but also just watching the snakes attack was fun. The director and writer came up with some interesting ways for snakes to bite.

679,neodante23-1,Another Muddafestering Review,8,18 August 2006,"It's often said that the simplest things are the best...and so this proves in grand B-movie style.Snakes on a Plane. There's not much room for confusion. This is a thriller about a crate-load of toothsome reptiles being released onto a 747.Why, you ask? Well, on board the LA-bound plane is beach bum Sean Jones (Phillips), a key witness to a mob murder by a ruthless gang boss.He's being escorted by veteran FBI agent Neville Flynn (Jackson), who rightly suspects that there's a few people who want Sean dead.Nev's convinced they've given the bad boys the swerve...but what he doesn't know is that hidden in the hold is a crate-load of vicious vipers primed to be set free by a timing mechanism.And just to make things interesting, they've been sprayed with pheremone by the resourceful killers to make them extra aggressive.As Nev comments when he learns about the menace he's facing: ""That's great news - snakes on crack!"".At the alloted time, the scaly little (and big) fellahs slither out and wriggle along to fuselage and slide into the passenger cabin by the ventilation shaft.One particularly resourceful reptile manages to drop down on a randy couple seeking membership of the Mile High Club, considerately managing to gouge the panting teen queen's breast in the process.Pretty soon, all hell breaks loose as a roll call of passengers find themselves bitten in the arm, the groin, the eye....and one poor chap eye-wateringly regrets his decision to take a leak.Victims include a Jo Brand doppelganger, a pompous rapper and the pilot while Nev and a spikey trolley-dolly attempt to get the upper hand with their scaly nemesis.The above-average thriller has been the big screen phenonemum of the year by virtue of its firestorm of internet buzz and it no press-screenings rule.The truth is it's movies that intimately knows its audience and - for this reason - is set to wriggle its way to the top of the box office charts.If you ignore plot holes a family of boa constrictors could wriggle through and gaping implausibilities, then this is poisonously addictive.All bad movies should be this good.",Snakes on a Plane

You don't want any lessons on life, moral messages, or tearjerkers, you just want some pure entertainment for a couple of hours. If that's what you want, then Snakes On A Plane is your movie! I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It had action, humor, bad guys getting what they deserve, creeps, tension - all the stuff that makes a movie fun. It also had Samuel L. Jackson, who is always worth the price of a ticket because he's good in anything he does. I can tell he apparently had a blast making this movie. It didn't waste time on a lot of sub-plots - like making sure the gangster responsible for the snakes got what he deserved, or a lot of extra story regarding the witness. There was just enough background on characters to advance the plot - that's all. The only expectation I had going into this movie was to be entertained for a while, and that is definitely what I got. I highly recommend Snakes On A Plane!",Snakes on a Plane
682,Blhulk,Believe The Hype!,10,20 August 2006,"For what seems like about five years at this point, the Internet has been abuzz with news of Snakes on a Plane, which is perhaps the most literal and serendipitous film name ever devised. The name, coupled with Samuel L. Jackson's involvement with the project, took what sounded like a Sci Fi Original Movie and turned it into an online sensation that just might change the way films are made and marketed in Hollywood.At this point, the story of Snakes is well-documented; marketing books have already been written on the subject. New Line, the studio responsible for green-lighting and marketing the film, did the unthinkable: they listened to the enormous Internet outpouring. Since the fan community was clamoring for a more adult film than the studio was planning, they went back and re-shot scenes for Snakes, adding profanity and nudity throughout. The marketing of the film also relied heavily on the fan voice. Bloggers were mobilized to promote Snakes, and soon the online hype was ubiquitous.Heading into the screening, it was difficult to imagine that the movie would deliver on the monumental Snakes on a Plane build-up. But it does. The film succeeds in every way it sets out to: it is at turns an intense thrill ride, a hilarious comedy, and a truly gory horror film. Sure, it's coated in a sheen of camp, but who could expect anything less? The story is fairly simple. After witnessing a brutal murder in Hawaii, Sean Jones (played by accent-less Wolf Creek alum Nathan Phillips) is taken into federal custody by FBI agent Neville Flynn, played by Samuel L. Jackson. The feds commandeer the first class section of the plane, forcing the annoyed passengers back to coach to mix with the commoners. Unbeknownst to the travelers, the murderer, a ruthless drug boss known as Eddie Kim, has filled the cargo hold with hundreds of deadly, venomous snakes. By nature, snakes are fairly docile, so to get them riled up enough to take the plane down, he's made sure the plane is filled with pheromones, which is apparently the snake equivalent of PCP. At 30,000 feet, the snakes are released, and the literal title is played out on screen.The boarding and ascent sets up the passenger personalities: the bitchy Hilton-esquire socialite, the Diddy-like germ phobic rapper (and his two hefty sidekicks), the newlywed guy who is afraid of flying, the single mother, the pair of unaccompanied minors, the annoyed businessman, etc. In a short time, the film does a great job of thumbnailing each character and making them relatable, which is something far too many films of this kind gloss over.There is a humor and fun associated with the production that comes through in the final product. It's apparent that the creators were having a good time making this movie, and it seems like New Line and director David R. Ellis were tickled to include fan suggestions. The light-heartedness is what will make the movie a success. Snakes on a Plane doesn't take itself too seriously, and moviegoers shouldn't, either.When the snakes begin to spill out into the plane and the mayhem ensues, there is plenty of carnage, but each of the characters has some kind of mini-arc, and that is refreshing. As cheesy as the film can get, it retains a heart. Perhaps the most surprising thing about Snakes on a Plane is that the script does a good job of structuring the action and making each new danger work within that world. The concept seems silly, as there are surely many easier ways to kill a government witness, but are any of them this fun? The scenes of snakes rampaging through the cabin are the reason everyone bought a ticket, and they definitely deliver. Virtually every part of a human body is bitten or strangled at some point in the movie, and the deaths are creatively gory. Not all of them are true to real-life snake attacks (for instance, snakes do not burrow into eye sockets or climb inside of live people), but in the throes of action, it is pointless to nitpick whether an enormous Burmese python with cougar fangs could eat a man's head or not (it could).The action is consistent and varied and the tension ratchets up nicely. Jump moments are sprinkled throughout the film, but there are genuinely creepy images and some excellent action sequences as well.Effects snobs will likely be let down by the computer-generated snakes that are used heavily throughout the film. In terms of split, it is probably about 80% CG snakes and only 20% practical varmints. The budget was mega-low (under $30 million before re shoots), so it's understandable, but it can be distracting for people used to better computer-generated fare.Ultimately, though, it's not about the effects. It's about Samuel Jackson and a ragtag bunch of passengers going toe-to-belly with one of the most ancient genus of animals on the planet. Jackson does not disappoint, and he raises the intensity level throughout the film with a solid performance. When he finally delivers the signature line from the film, expect applause.In one word, Snakes on a Plane is fun. It never aspires to be anything more than a kick-ass popcorn film that plays on a weird mash-up of fears, and that is why it's a success. What it will mean for the movie biz remains to be seen, but what it will mean for you is pure, visceral, gleeful entertainment.",Snakes on a Plane

Especially when it comes with a lot of lots of humour and innuendo, but I'm not a fan of Snake on a Plane.There are three potential draws to this film:  The comedy of the situation;  The horror; and  The novelty of hundreds of snakes being of a plane. Firstly, this film isn't written as a tongue-in-cheek horror or a comedy, and there are only 1 or 2 points in the film where you'll smile to yourself. If you want to get the feel of the film, the trailer genuinely represents the movie, a horror.Secondly, if you're expecting a film full of action and shocks, you won't be disappointed. It doesn't stand out above other movies, but it always keeps your attention.Thirdly, Although the novelty of Snakes of a Plane doesn't wear off, but you'll leave the cinema thinking ""what was all the fuss about"".I know this movie has a high rating, but it doesn't add up. A) Many of the reviews where written before the film was released and, B) The breakdown of user ratings has a lot less variation than normal 77% of people rating the movie 10/10, with only 7% of people giving it 9/10 - Why such an enormous gap?",Snakes on a Plane

Sure acting should be fun and so should guitar playing but Samuel is going where music has gone, people will stop knowing what their expressing and then only express anger from a state of confusion. I blame Samuel for agreeing to play in this movie, this must be the first sign of the end of the world. I used to admire Samuel, he seemed to throw out this sense of intelligence. But after seeing this movie and then stepping back to all his previous films I've realized that maybe he only worked with directors that helped make him look smart because he's definitely not consistent. It's actors jobs to know something about story and not just choose something dumb because your getting old and are tired of thinking. It's time to reinvent yourself, please I'm begging you. Let me want to see you in a film, it's easy just pick scripts that actually have a story. Don't believe just because your getting old you have limited possibilities. Ooh yeah finding out that the majority loved this film is just another reminder that the world majority is below dumb, unfortunately this is why the world might end. You might think I'm joking but really, what is the story of this stupid movie? Good cult films have stories, when I heard cult I was thinking, experimental, anything but student film. It's worse then a student film, it's elementary school student dropout film. If you're as stupid to think cult film meens that it's intentionally a pile of crap meens you've never understood cult films and it meens you have to be along one of the most stupid species in existence.

Jackson delivers his classic line of the movie (you know what I mean) the entire theater shakes with applause.The movie got a standing ovation at the end, because it was so bad, that it was funny.In 10 years, this movie may be viewed as a spoof or a social satire about how cliché movies can get, because just about every possible cliché was in this movie, and I loved absolutely every minute of it.

That did happen, but I worked at this particular theater for 2 years, so he just wanted to annoy me. Still I had this unease about admitting I wanted to see this.As the movie started I was reminded of the ""McBain"" spoofs on ""The Simpsons"". The bad guy was REALLY evil, and laughably blood thirsty, the witness was a little too good of a guy, and very one dimensional, and Samual L. Jackson is his normal self. In other words it has a very eighties direct to video feel. It's as if the people making it wanted those that where there to see it on a dare to exit within the first ten minutes.I was surprised, though, at how good they managed to make this film. I take that back, good cannot describe this piece of cinema, entertaining is a more apt term. I have a feeling that Sam Jackson just wanted a paid vacation, and the fun factor really seems to enrich his performance. In fact it is hard to not like the characters in this movie. From the germiphobe gangsta rapper, to the pilot that seems to be one step away from a sexual harassment law suit, they are all written to perfection for this movie. I think that the actors all had the idea to try to make ""Snakes on a Plane"" an Oscar contender for 2006. There isn't a chance in h*ll, but they put forth a valiant effort.All in all, if you are looking for a decent way to kill 90 min. or so, ""Snakes on a Plane"" might be right up your alley. It's not as artistically brilliant as ""Miami Vice"", nor is it as smart as ""V for Vendetta"", but there are a lot of worse things out there.",Snakes on a Plane
691,ButterscotchCrumpetpatch,Brilliant,9,18 August 2006,"I just had THE best cinematic experience tonight! Everyone in the audience was just so hyped up about Snakes on A Plane, so there was a great atmosphere. Everybody clapped and cheered at the appropriate moments (especially at the line which Sam L. Jackson (already) famously says ""I've had it with these mother f---ing snakes on this mother f----ing plane!"") it was unbelievable.The movie itself is an instant cult classic.It wouldn't have worked so well without Sam Jackson though, who's bad-ass FBI agent character is played by him in a way that you feel he's loving coming to the point where he is parodying his own bad-ass image and previous characters he's played. There is also a fair share of humor in there, brilliantly placed every time, although a lot of it very dark. There is plenty of gore in the film too. It's in the style you would expect from a horror movie really; the way the snakes bite, and people falling onto glass etc. it's very jarring imagery. And the fact that the plot is quite simple left plenty of room for action and character building (and parodying!).It's hard to explain exactly, but this film seems like a joke that nearly everybody gets. The premise and title of ""Snakes on a Plane"" seems so utterly ridiculous yet so genius at the same time, especially as the movie, thrilling and dramatic and humorous as it is, never takes itself completely seriously.If you're into this sort of B-movie type nonsense, you will love this (even if your not, I would recommend it). And I would definitely recommend watching it in a cinema full of people completely involved in what's going on; the atmosphere just enhanced things three-fold!",Snakes on a Plane

But, for this premise it excels! You see Samuel L and expect to hear particular profanities -- check! Plane -- check!Snakes -- check! Violence & other vices -- check! This movie is entertaining if you're in the right frame of mind & there is a great audience. I saw it with a frantically hyped-up audience that was doing the wave of all things! Everybody played their roles do the bone. I hadn't checked IMDb before seeing it but didn't anticipate Keenan Thompson or Dan Koechener! They seriously did their duty.

Audience Participation makes it a 15 out of ten. It has a real Rocky Horror feel, without the dancing and singing. If you see a show by your self it is a truly great film also.

I Like action movies but this movie has to rank up there with Anaconda and the Blob(remake) in the cheesy factor. Yes yes I know the title does say it all but they could have at least attempted to make a good 'B' movie. The story starts out OK and then goes down the toilet as soon as they board the plane.....I guess New Line Cinema decided this was a floater and there was no way that it was going to be flushed. For starters they could have at least spent a little more time and money on the snakes. Come on, I've seen better computer animation on kids TV shows. Maybe they got a bargain on local college students? What's worse is the snakes even seem to be intelligent....slithering down there prey time and time again as they work there way through the cabin. I'm really surprised Samuel L. Jackson agreed to do this film but I'm sure that money was a big factor. It might be worth a look if you like lame CGI effects and can tolerate the extremely stupid plot. Don't waste your money even on a rental, wait for the TNT showing free on TV during the holidays.....the egg nog will definitely ease the pain of watching this one.",Snakes on a Plane

If they had to re-describe what a B-Movie is SNAKES ON A PLANE is it. I don't think anyone could have done a better job than Samuel L. Jackson, the man is great in the part. In my opinion a B-Movie is a movie that is not main stream but more of a direct to DVD type of then like sabertooth and rottweiler . I may have to see this movie more than once because when I saw the sneak preview everyone was yelling and clapping, which I think is not what a B-Movie does to people. I don't think people would have cared for it or noticed if this movie went to DVD. The movie is great there was more people there than superman tanks , I mean superman returns. This movie is destined to be a cult classic and a big seller on DVD, I know I will buy one. Lets see more FU@#ING snakes on more FU@#ING THINGS.",Snakes on a Plane

I was in a foul mood, as things weren't appearing to go my way, and needed something to clear my mind. Then it came to me - a movie! I went to the theater and chose ""Snakes On A Plane"" as my matinée for today. Pretty simple title, right? Snakes On A Plane? Sure thing, but I wasn't prepared for the power that came with each ferocious bite.This movie was so silly, so ludicrous...yet so much fun! I can't remember the last time I screamed so much in a theater; and guess what...I loved every bit of it (no pun intended). I'm no screamer, and I'm the LAST person to fall for cheap scare tactics seen in most horror flicks, but these snakes got into everything imaginable and they just kept coming, no matter how tightly I grabbed my seat. I'm embarrassed to say this, but at some points I screamed like Nathan Lane in ""The Birdcage"", which makes me very glad I saw this movie by myself.Go see Snakes On A Plane!

Don't wait for a DVD release of this this is was without a doubt one of the best times I've had at the theater the audience laughed and clapped through the movie as did I along with them. When the movie ended some of the audience were yelling ""BEST F**KING MOVIE EVER!!!!"". The plot of this movie needs no explanation so if you are unsure of it read the title. Sam Jackson is excellent as always trying to defend a witness and the passengers against the snakes. This movie is a must see for anybody willing to realize that it's supposed to be funny if you don't believe me listen to the first line played when the ending credits roll and ask yourself if this movie was serious would that really be there?

The things which really upsetted me was the computer animations were not up to the mark. I mean it didn't look real. So many snakes all together and then a giant constrictor boa on the plane. You really need to have several thousands to show that number. Secondly They never tried to tell how in the first place somebody smuggled so many snakes in. I was hoping that Sam Jackson would make some funny/interesting comments. Not really it was mundane. The only good comment was at the end....""he's my brother from a different mother."" Overall if you go and watch this movie, don't go with any expectations.

It should be the standard against which all movies are henceforth judged.Neville Flynn is my hero. SLJ should get an Oscar for his performance.

Samuel L Jackson, a plane, and, of course... hundreds of deadly snakes. The film clearly doesn't take itself too seriously, with overexaggerated stereotypes and an intentionally ridiculous plot line. These, of course, work in the film's favour; a film about snakes on a plane would be difficult to swallow if it took itself seriously. Jackson's performance was excellent, and the delivery of his infamous line - ""I have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane"" - was well-timed and perfectly executed. That line alone, silly as it may seem, is worth the price of admission.",Snakes on a Plane
703,writegabe,Community Theater: the New Guilty Pleasure,8,18 August 2006,"Not having been a fan of gory horror films for all of my life(my idea of a great scary movie is a classic Hitchcock), I confess I would not have gone to see this if it weren't the fact that Sam Jackson was the star and that the title(and premise) were so blatant a throwback to the 70's exploitation/disaster films that I grew up with. As with titles like ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""Earthquake,"" it's not afraid to give away it's hand right off. By no means does the film aim for subtlety, or anything more than cursory cinematic artistry. The snakes are obviously CGI, but so is Spiderman when He swings from the the canyons of Manhattan's skyscrapers. This film makes no pretensions to being better written than a satisfying comic book. The fun of this film is knowing that everyone else in the theater chose this film for the same reasons you did: to be entertained. I jumped in my seat, I cheered at the moments when Sam's character stomps, kicks, sizzles, or using whatever methods he decides to use, kicks reptile ass, and cringed when victims were killed off, in many chill-inducing ways. The best part was that everyone else in the theater did the very same thing. This film is the reason we still have theaters in this age of the solitary DVD.",Snakes on a Plane
704,SilentThunder,What's in a name...,4,12 September 2006,"""Snakes on a plane""... I don't know what the movie makers were thinking when they chose that name, but it must have been something like ""Gee, a movie about snakes on a plane, only really dumb people are gonna watch that! Better make the name as simple as possible..."".Anyway, it's obvious that this is probably the worst movie name ever, but how's the movie itself? Well, it delivers what the title promises. Snakes on a plane. No more, no less. Apart from a little story to explain why the snakes are on the plane, which is of no importance at all because people don't go watch a movie called ""Snakes on a plane"" for its interesting plot development, the movie mainly consists of - you'll never guess - snakes on a plane. A lot of 'em. Of course, the snakes attack and people start getting killed in nasty and sometimes funny but always predictable ways. Nothing you couldn't have derived from the name of the movie and the trailer. Throw in some cheesy one-liners and a few scary moments, and you've got yourself a movie. Not a good movie, of course.Now you might think ""I don't care, as long as it's entertaining!"". And you would be right, entertainment is all a movie like this needs. And ""Snakes on a plane"" has its moments... but not enough to justify the price of a movie ticket, a DVD or even a night in front of the TV. The movie is simply too predictable, too brainless and not scary enough. Judging by the amount of body fluids flowing on screen, this was supposed to be a horror movie, but it simply isn't. The only horror in this movie is having to watch one and a half hours of... snakes on a plane!",Snakes on a Plane

706,bharatbhoite,Fun B move for a lazy afternoon,6,10 December 2019,"It is amazing to me that they managed to make a plausible plot for a movie with the title- Snakes on a Plane. Calling the plot plausible though is kinda pushing it. But you are not here for the plot anyway.You are here to see Sam Jackson kick some snake! And indeed he does! He plays an FBI agent who is tasked to take a witness securely from Hawaii to LA so he can testify against an evil gangster. The evil gangster retaliates by adding some deadly, venomous snakes to the plane's cargo who start attacking everyone and everything in the plane midway. And that's the plot!I really enjoyed the movie because it reasonably managed to build tension until the very end. The ferocious snake attacks, the dutch camera angles, the jump scares etc. were at least fun if not scary. The performances were credible enough. The hot and  flight crew had a very tongue in cheek way about them which was quite funny. Juliana Margulies was okay. We also get to see a young Kenan Thompson and Bobby Cannavale. But the highlight of the movie is Samuel L. Jackson. He plays a guy who has nothing special about him except that he is very good at his job. He calmly takes charge in some of the most incredible challenges thrown at a lead character in a movie. And the iconic line comes at the best moment in the movie and you totally get his frustration.All in all, it's a good B movie made better by one of the best actors we know",Snakes on a Plane
707,edd8990,There's snakes... and they're on a plane!,9,19 August 2006,"OK. Lets cut straight to it. This film barely has any plot. The science and tech facts are the usual Hollywood BS. the writing is a bit dubious, and most of the characters are stereotypical. In several places the edits made after the films sudden popularity are too obviously spliced in. Finally the film contains just about every plane-disaster-film cliché there is. All this added together means I should have hated it, but I didn't.Quite the contrary, I loved it. Samuel L. Jackson was excellent, watching him kick snake ass is just as fun as watching him kick human ass. There is just about enough occasions where snakes jump out of the walls to keep some tension, and some of the snake bites were in uncomfortable enough places to keep you wincing.All in all, if you are after a cerebral movie, which you can talk learnedly about, this is really not a film to see. If however like me you want to see a film where you can have an hour and three quarters of mindless, unbelievable, fun; if you can say ""Wow... THERE'S SNAKES ON A PLANE!!"" then you REALLY need to see this movie.",Snakes on a Plane
708,madxboxskills,An overall good movie.,7,21 August 2006,"I had been reading about this movie online ever since the first little preview was shown. And after seeing it today, I have to say, It was the most fun I've had at the movies in a while.I had seen Talladega Nights a couple days ago and after seeing SOAP I can honestly tell you SOAP was a FAR greater movie. I laughed more in SOAP and was more interested in it than TN. SOAP doesn't take its self seriously, and in my opinion, and thats what makes it such a good movie. It has its funny moments, and its sexxy moments, and just down-right ""oh chit"" moments. A little mix of everything. If you see one movie, well, before school starts. Go see Snakes on a Plane you wont be disappointed (sp?) I had brought a friend of mine,(a girl BTW), along with me to see this movie. She went into it thinking she was going to be bored out of her mind and hate the movie, she walked out laughing and talking about it just as much as me. So don't listen to all the movie snobs that say this is the worst movie out. Go see it, and have a good time. I know we did.~Alix~",Snakes on a Plane
709,W-Uno,To summarise: There are snakes... on a plane,10,21 August 2006,"I, along with a lot of internet nerds, have been awaiting this film with excited anticipation and near-girlish glee. I first came across it when surfing this very site and looking at Samuel L. Jackson's upcoming projects. As it did the man himself, the title grabbed me immediately by the nuts. After all, who couldn't love a film in which the title is also the sum total of the plot and character motivation? I went to see it today, at my very first opportunity, naturally. I was in the cinema not an hour ago watching it. It was glorious. It was every bit as ridiculous as I had hoped but all wrapped in the shroud of a serious horror-action. Despite my pant-wetting fear of snakes, my cringes were tempered with laughter at any number of parts, but I was also invested in the plot. Will they make it? Who will save that baby? I'll be totally honest, Nathan Phillips sucked. His acting was an insult to the world of acting. Rachel Blanchard was as vacuous as even in her Clueless (tv show) days. Flex Alexander and Terry Chen's characters were empty stereotypes.Usually those facts alone would disqualify a film from a 10 star rating in my book, but it simply doesn't matter in a film so flippant. A film which had Samuel L Jackson hooked by the cover-page of the script. A film which added lines and scenes because of an internet parody. How would it be possible not to love Snakes on a Plane? Spoiler alert: At one point a snake comes up out of the toilet bowl as a guy is urinating, a drip hits the snake on the head and it recoils down before biting him on the groin. Surely that alone is enough to make up for any bad acting?",Snakes on a Plane
710,lovelylesu2,S.O.A.P Great Movie for Everyone (Even the Non-Belivers),8,18 August 2006,"First of all my sister and I poked fun at the title. It was a little to obvious, Anyway, this movie was way better then I anticipated it to be. This movie has a touch terror, a dash of humor and a pinch of everything else you would need to make the movie perfect.The starts off when Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) witnesses a brutal mob killing, he is than escorted to L.A. by F.B.I. agent Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) to testify against the killer. Some way or other the mobs put poisonous snakes in cargo and time them to release. Now Neville Flynn has to find away to get the plane to the ground and keep his witness alive.The movie was pretty exciting from the beginning to the end. For all those who love Samuel L. Jackson and the way that he talks this movie if perfect for you cause he doesn't disappoint. If you love thrillers and a little gore, then go to the nearest theater and have a seat. If you like all of that wrapped into one movie then Snakes On A Plane is the movie for you. Normally I think movies like this would be a waste of money but wasn't I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. It is definably worth the 9:00 or more bucks you spend on tickets. I think I was on the edge of my set the either time.

711,docgui,Better than expected and lots of snakes on a plane.,8,17 August 2006,"Good movie that will be made better if you get a full house.Once past the cruddy credit sequence and cliché setup, the movie chugged along most admirably till the end. As soon as Mr. Jackson appears the coast becomes clear for the movie to take off both literally and figuratively. The pacing and gruesome body count keeps ratcheting up until the final quarter and then with the trademark line delivered it loses just the tiniest bit of steam. The ending is not rushed mind you it's just that after you have been through this ride of a movie you might feel sensitive to the unexpected lull for a moment.The end is solid if not spectacular but the movie as a whole is entirely worth seeing. It's not good because it was bad but because it was good. People (myself included) expected a B movie. Sure the actors are for the most part B and C list but the direction gets the most out of all of them. The plot in the air is great and comparable to some of the better airplane and passengers encounter trouble in the air genre. The on the ground plot is not bad but not great either. But lets be clear, this is as much a horror movie as an action thriller.Another movie this summer (in the IMAX version) tried to give the audience a taste of the experience of flight. It lasted less than 3 minutes. Snakes on a Plane did it too, but instead of freedom the audience was stuck in a tin can plane filled with snakes for over an hour with only minor comedy for relief.

717,iksose3,A Plane + Hunders of Snakes + Samuel L Jackson = Film of the Year,10,19 August 2006,"I can remember my first reaction to hearing about a film called ""Snakes on a Plane"", it was something like 'No frigging way!', but my friends were right enough, and two months later on Friday August 18th, Snakes on a Plane was released slithering and hissing into Cinemas across Britain. By this point, it was the hype on the internet and a hot topic of conversation so naturally it had to be seen on the first showing ever.The film opens with scenes that can mainly be described as depicting a very important point about the film, why there is a huge ass crate of poisonous snakes on a flight from Hawaii to Los Angeles. People may think that the writers would be incapable of putting this scenario into a real life chain of events, but they have done so by using a time honoured action scenario, ""Witness Protection Program"". Resputed Mobster, Eddie Kim, plants a box of snakes on the same flight as the man who will testify against him in Los Angeles. Nothing too far fetched about that right?Now, it was time for the big guns, the real reason why the film was, in my opinion, such a dynamic hit. The man himself, Samuel L Jackson. There are next to no actors that could act convincingly through a film titled ""Snakes on a Plane"" which contains the immortal line ""I've had it with these mother fuc***g snakes on this mother fuc***g plane!"", but God bless him, Samuel hits the nail on the head. His acting is superb and gives Snakes on a Plane the class that separates it from ""Humorous film"" to ""Epic Oscar Material"". The writing is also beyond description. You probably said to yourself, ""What can some snakes on a plane do for two hours or so?"" and I assure you, I thought exactly the same thing, but if you go to see it you'll find yourself marvelling at all the situations and twists and turns that the Snakes on a Planes plot has.Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, Snakes on a Plane's other cast members do such a wonderful job in bringing the film to life. Rachel Blanchard acts amazingly well as a wealthy upper class women with an almost insane love for her small dog, while Flex Alexander, Kenan Thompson and Keith Dallas act out as humorous Rapper ""Three G's"" and bodyguards ""Troy"" and ""Big Leroy"".If Snakes on a plane were to get an Oscar (appart from the almost definite Best Actor win for Samuel L) it would be costume design. The effects created by the designers on depicting all the snakes victims is amazing, it is actually comparable to LOTR in my opinion.If Snakes on a Plane were to be given a bad side it would only be seen from one group of peoples point of view, the people who came to see Snakes on a Plane and see an Action Thriller and just that. For, you see, I can guarantee there will not be a single showing of Snakes on a Plane where there isn't a burst of giggles or laugher from the audience, as the who scenario and dialogue of the characters is so farcical to us its hard not to be amused.I say to you finally, that if you have even once thought ""Maybe I should see that"" you blooming well should. Snakes on a Plane will be a talked about film in years to come, and it worth whatever it costs to get into the cinema for the two hour ride of a lifetime.",Snakes on a Plane

When I came out I was cured of my disease and my girlfriend turned into a gorgeous large breasted woman.In all seriousness, this movie is the best time I ever had at a movie theater. The movie spends no more than five minutes on the plot, which is, honestly was too long, that is five minutes that there could've been snakes on a plane.If you go expecting a movie with a plot, heavy character development, and plot twists this is the movie for you. Not really. If you see this movie for what it is, a goofy terrible movie that is so awesomely bad that you will enjoy more than any other movie you have seen.",Snakes on a Plane
719,mordiceius,Bad or Campy Entertainment?,10,18 August 2006,"I'm here to give you the lowdown on the biggest movie out there right now: Snakes on a Plane.Let's just put it this way, there were a LOT more snakes than I expected. It was a crazy good time. My girlfriend was squirming, screaming and laughing the whole way. And yes, he does say ""I'm sick of these mother@#$#ing snakes on this mother@#$#ing plane!"" This is going to quickly become a classic that will be on my DVD shelf.Action: 10/10 You get to see people get bit on every place on their body. List a place on someone's body and I assure they got bit there. You get to see snakes burned, blown up, frozen, chopped up, stabbed and beat against the wall and they never stop coming.Story: 9/10 It's Snakes on a Plane. You expect a story? In all honesty, it had a lot of heart to it. There were some great emotional scenes in there. It surprised me in a good way.Acting: 9/10 Samuel L. Jackson shines in this. He plays his part well. Really well. You have basically every stereotypical flier: a rich girl, a lady with a baby, some kids who have never flown before, a husband that's afraid of flying, an jerk foreigner, a rapper and posse, a kick-boxer and many more. You'll be surprised who lives and dies.Sounds & Music: 9/10 All the music is done really well for the creepiness. I jumped many times.Overall: 11/10 Snakes on a Plane delivers. If you think it's worthless, I suggest taking a second look and you may be surprised. It was amazing.",Snakes on a Plane

The B-class acting (including Jackson), the sub-par made for DVD script, and weak graphics made this a chore to sit through. I would never recommend this film to anyone, no matter what they are in the mood for. Horrible casting made this film even worse. It had the making for a mediocre comedy that failed miserably. The characters were weak and it mainly felt like any spoof on speed where there are random people on a plane in danger. A rapper, sex driven couples, the jerk and the strong business woman that turns into a beautiful idiot whenever a rich man shows up. The only good parts of this film were the typical f*@k filled line spoken by Jackson and the ""obviously gay male flight attendant.",Snakes on a Plane

Could something this big actually be good? I worried that the studio may have catered too much to the internet, and made a movie that was fan service with no substance. I worried that they would make a movie that couldn't live up to the excitement.I was wowed. Sure, it's gore and guts and just plain gross at times, but the film actually made me feel involved. I didn't know how they'd solve the dire problem of snakes on the plane. I was sad at times, and cheered at others. I cared about the actual story, not just Samuel L. Jackson killing snakes in a variety of fashions.Sure, there were gratuitous scenes and some outright unbelievable parts, but as it turns out-- I had nothing to worry about after all.I encourage you to bring your friends and find a rowdy theatre, because this is definitely one that makes you want to scream, laugh, and cheer.",Snakes on a Plane

It started out with an opening that made you think maybe this would be a movie worth watching, but progressed to a silly, childish middle with people acting in ways that are very unrealistic. It did not develop the plot just presented an idea and then left you hanging. It had a predictable ending, nothing unusual in the plot. It looked like a movie written by a teenager. Most of the people in the theatre I went to appeared to be teenagers that looked barely old enough to be in an R movie.

They cant show even a fraction of the great material in this film. Other people have said that it is in the ""so bad its good"" category, I say here now to correct them, that this film is so great nothing else will be able to rival it for years. It was action packed, edge of your seat thrills, and funny when it was supposed to be. It covered all bases of a great masterpiece.

It's not funny. It's not campy. It's not clever.If there is a worse movie than this, please warn me lest I go see it and waste yet another two hours of my life.By the way, is there a reason Samuel L.

The preppy girl, the asshole business guy, the newly weds, the rap star, the gay flight attendant. Hollywood and critics will hate this movie because it goes against everything they like.

What was the point?), it was nice to see something lighthearted and just out-right fun. Everyone seemed to have a lot of fun making this movie. And that's exactly how it should be watched: as a bit of fun.Apparently Samuel L Jackson insisted on the name and has suggested a sequel, tentatively titled ""Snakes on Crack"". My only comment: they could have had a lot more fun with stereotypes, e.g. the Paris-cum-Britney-cum-Nicole character. The best scene in the movie? When the chihuahua gets it.

For extra fun, sneak around goosing the girls whenever one of the snakes on screen bites someone! It's great fun.I had a blast watching Snakes, but *only* because I had been listening to the fan buildup of support for the movie on the Internet ( http://www.michaelandevo.com/ ) for months and months before I actually saw the film.

I have nothing against it, i actually found it quite entertaining, it has action, drama and yes even sex, but for me it isn't complete without the story line, also it would have been good to see some follow up at the end.So in conclusion if you are looking for an action movie, that is entertaining then this is the movie for you, however if you are after a story line that enthralls you, then this may be somewhat of a let down.",Snakes on a Plane

I hate snakes, and I'm not a fan of horror movies, but this movie made me laugh more than anything. It was great to see the director and actors take a lighthearted approach to an absurd plot line.Basically, a young man witnesses a murder by an LA crime boss in Hawaii. Sam Jackson takes him into FBI custody in order to testify and put this boss behind bars for life.They get on a plane back to mainland USA, and halfway through the flight are surprised by SNAKES ON THE MUTHA_________ PLANE!

The next half hour is filled with snakes in the bathroom, snakes in the cockpit, snakes in the cargo bay, ... snakes on the entire plane.I went in expecting a movie so bad it's good, but this movie actually surprised me. It's a lot better than most of the slasher flicks out there, and is not really horror (though some of the snake attacks will make you jump, those sneaky sneaky snakes!), but is carried very well by Kenan Thompson and Jackson.

This movie wasn't about some damn deep meaning we've all gone and heard about over and over, and it wasn't about making the crowd feel the pain that the people in the movie were experiencing. Which was a refreshing change I must say. But this movie was about defining the essence of the true American Man!

See 'Snakes on a Plane', and it will be the most fun you ever have in a movie theater, guaranteed. Samuel L.

And i don't care where you are or how high you are, if you blow a whole in the cabin a belt and your grip wont keep you in that plane.

The delivery definitely one-upped the hype and I think everyone left feeling that they got their money's worth.

Something that is interesting is that although they don't use the music from the music video for the theme song, they do play the video during the credits.

To challenge moral and ethical debates through drama? To thrill us? To discover what the screenwriter has to say about life? Yes and no. The main goal is to make an audience happy that they went to the movie theatre that night. Snakes on a Plane has one goal, ultimately. That is to make sure that the audience has fun. Regardless of which scene was shot where and why and under what coercion.Not since Godzilla 2000 or Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow have I had more fun in a theatre. If you go to see Snakes on a Plane, you probably know what you're getting into. Most likely it will exceed your expectations.If you start complaining that landing a 747 will be too difficult for the person who ultimately does the deed, or that snake POV shots shouldn't be green, then you've missed the point. The point is that we have a movie that targets a core audience and delivers in every way.See Snakes on a Plane. Allow the film to take you in as it once did in the old school serials of space rangers, giant apes, and mind control robots. There's still a place for that wonderful stuff.Allow screen treasure Samuel L. Jackson to save you from those snakes on that plane in the only way you know that he knows how. Snakes on a Plane has a lame, contrived plot.... so lets go to the nearest theatre and have as much fun as possible. Let's allow the cinema to make us smile again.Make sure you cheer the good scenes, if you know any of the good lines, shout them out with truth and confidence for only one reason....That's it, I have had it with all these....Carry on, James Luke",Snakes on a Plane

I thought this movie would be absolutely perfect for that purpose.And man, was i right!! This was a cheesy movie that included every possible action cliché that you have ever seen in a movie.

Most or maybe even all of the audience was expecting an action movie so bad that it was a comedy, myself included. Little did we realize that we were about to be treated to an above average action movie with intense action, and hilarity at Samuel L. Jackson's well developed character and his delightful and already famous quotes.The plot is elegantly simple. A man witnesses a gang murder of a middle aged man, and is flown to L.A from Hawaii to testify against the gang leader who killed the man. Then after trying to kill him in other ways (only to be thwarted by Samuel L. Jackson ans Neville Flynn) the gang decides the only way to kill the witness is through... you guessed it... snakes on a plane! There are some hokey things that don't really make sense, but they are easy to overlook (even for me, and i usually pick apart the science behind movies pretty badly- don't even get me started on ""Cars"") if you just appreciate that this film is credited for its action packed-ness and its comedy, not its plausibility and accuracy.Bottom Line: This movie makes you really happy that you've witnessed it when you leave.

Even the ones who said they hate even the name of the movie were changed as soon as the snakes are seen biting a nipple.

But for those of us who love same jackson, love snake movies, and love a movie thats just fun with an easy to follow plot, we will cherish this forever. This movie was a great ride, and great fun, sam Jackson's funnest movie in a long time and definitely 1 of my faves. THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!! 10/10",Snakes on a Plane
750,agony_and_beauty,Snakes goes down in flames,1,18 August 2006,"I had the incredible misfortune of being dragged to this movie. Never in all my movie-going years have I seen such a sad, pedantic attempt at entertainment. I mean there are stinkers, and then there are movies that reek so bad they should be handing out hospital masks at the concession stand before you go in. I don't have anything against the typical cookie cutter fluff Hollywood cranks out because it's not meant to do anything but entertain and makes no apologies for how bad they suck. But this film seems to try to be believable, punctuated by moments of seriousness. This movie falls short in every single category. The story (if you can call it that) is ridiculous, the plot superficial, the acting amateurish, the special effects anything but special.This film blew and I'd like to get a refund not only for the money I tossed away on it but also for the time I spent out of my life to watch it - time that could have been spent in infinitely more useful, and entertaining ways, like scrubbing out my toilet or searching for stray boils. Even my teenage daughter couldn't stomach this, and asked us to leave towards the end (to my relief) and that's saying a lot. Thumbs down.1/10",Snakes on a Plane

So going into the Thursday night show, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. It was either gonna be ""so-bad-it's-good"" or just plain bad. I'm happy to say that it's so good it's excellent! Yes it adds cheese by the pound, yes there is bad dialog and some bad acting. I didn't pay to see an Oscar bait-type film, no,no,no I paid to see Snakes on a Plane, with the always awesome Samuel L. Jackson! I'm not gonna give anything away, but just to kinda heighten the theater experience, it should be viewed in packed theater full of Planiacs, as the cult who have been following this movie since it was announced, have turned this movie into a new age Rocky Horror. How good is Snakes? Saw it 3 times this weekend and I'll probably see it again before it's run is over in theaters! When you go to the box office don't even question what your gonna see, just get a ticket for SoaP, trust me you will be entertained to the fullest!!",Snakes on a Plane

There were some parts that I busted out laughing at... like when the guy microwaves the snake, and of course when Samuel L. Jackson says, ""I have had enough of these mother-fing snakes on this mother-fing plane."" Priceless.Other parts made me grip the hell out the arms on my seat, close my eyes, and flinch (when they showed poision and puss oozing out of a dude's arms yuck). Because I drank one of those 3 gallon sodas I had to pee about half-way into it but I waited till' the end. It was that good.A few parts made me jump and got my heart pumping lol. As a child raised watching Chucky, It, Jaws, Freddie, etc.. .it's is extremely rare for a movie to do that. I find most scary movies to be funny and stupid. Of course there were some cheese factors but hell, with a title like that you should be expecting that.Definitely don't pass up ""Snakes On A Plane"", and make sure to go to the bathroom before you see it.

Snakes crawl out of every orifice and cause all kinds of unruly havoc for the passengers of a luxury liner, and it's up to Samuel L. Jackson to save the day. The flick is unabashedly unashamed to revel in its b-movie inspirations; and anyone who's ever wanted to see through 'snake vision' or the various dangers of snakes in the bathroom is going to get a huge kick out of this movie. Sam the man delivers, the snake attacks are a hoot, and it's nothing but a cheese-ball of fun. Seeing the film with a crowd will enhance the experience even further.If I were to have one complaint, it's that the movie ends without giving us the climactic showdown we truly want to see. Ending too early knocks a point or two off, but 'Snakes' is undeniably a charmer.",Snakes on a Plane

I saw it at a theater in Mounatin View, half the audience was from Google I swear...but a nice mix of high school slick-geeks and 30 somethings....60 - 70% bespectacled, you betchya!...seeing this on opening day reminded me of opening day for the first Star Wars prequel, only this didn't suck. Julianna Margulies is hottest of the ladies (who knew she looked so good without that curly hair), and Samuel lives up to all the hype. The film wastes no time in getting you on the plane, and in the air...there are classic moments of anticipation when you just know that someone is going to get it...get bit that is. Plus hours of fun scaring your spouse after the movie, there is some dope-ass turbulence too cause there's not just snakes, but snakes on a plane.

I laughed the whole way through it! man, it kept me on the edge of my seat, it was thrilling and it was hilarious! i really was expecting another flop of a movie, cause that is all that is produced now a days, but well this one proved me wrong. I was going to go see that Pulse movie, but I'm sooo glad i didn't. I really haven't seen any movie as good as this one in a LONG time. Snakes on a Plane had the entire theater jumping and laughing and even screaming at times. Walking out of the Theater was just about the worst thing to do, cause it was sooo good. But I do have to say, the video/song that plays through the end credits, SUCKED! lol. i was like what the mess is this?! haha. anyways.

This movie is absolutely hilarious in parts, it has catchy dialogs and a typical Sam Jackson character. The only people who shouldn't watch this movie are people who might be flying anytime soon!!! The situations that arise are interesting and it is hard to take your eyes away from the screen. Flex Alexander and his 'crew' are refreshing. A great action/comedy entertainer.",Snakes on a Plane
757,melksnor,"Jackson, the socialist hero",9,19 August 2006,"In snakes on a plane, a predominant concept is the distinction between ground and figure. Thus, Lacan suggests the use of the post-materialist paradigm of reality to analyze and challenge class. If the dialectic paradigm of expression holds, the works of Pynchon are not postmodern.It could be said that David R. Ellis' film on textual prestructural theory states that sexual identity has objective value. Baudrillard uses the term 'subcapitalist narrative' to denote the bridge between society and sexual identity.However, a number of sublimations concerning not, in fact, discourse, but neodiscourse may be discovered. Samuel L. Jackson promotes the use of socialist realism to attack the status quo.",Snakes on a Plane

(truer words were never spoken) Samuel l. Jackson has gone from being a freaking pimp in pulp fiction (still is) to being a DANG JEDI to an FBI agent killing freaking snakes on a freaking plane. this movie will never be surpassed. i mean WHO Wouldn't want to see a snake come out of a toilet and bite a mans PENE'? yeah i do because i felt so awesome. when i saw this movie i felt so pathetic that i wasn't sure if i still had my junk in tact. but then i went to the bathroom and i still had it don't worry. but yes i will admit i was afraid that a snake was gonna get it.16 stars out of 10 my name is Mad Stevenson and i love this movie,Snakes on a Plane

The movie looked to be a ""So-Bad-It's-Good"" Thriller, but does it deliver on that?Yes and no. It's not ""So-Bad-It's-Good"", it's just plain ""Good"". The Film Makers realized how ridiculous the idea of Snakes being on a Plane was and they actually implemented a good lot of comedy into the film, almost as if it was spoofing itself.The Cast of this Movie has all the stereotypes: Badass Black FBI Agent, ""Just Plain Ass"" FBI Agent, The OCD Rapper, Guy the villains are after that wants to help everyone but can't because if he dies they win, The Ditzy Blonde Girl with a Dog, The Asian KickBoxer, The Overweight Video Game Addict, the 2 Kids, The Woman with a Baby, The British Asshole and a ""Gay"" Flight Attendent. And of course, there is also tons of expendable extras, destined to die painfully via snake bites without any line of dialog.Although Samuel L. Jackson is the ""Big Name"" on this Film, there are other actors your may recognize. Julianna Margulies from ER plays a Flight Attendent, along with Kenan Thompson from Kenan and Kel as one of the Rappers Bodyguards, and David Koechner (Anchorman) plays the Co-Pilot.It's really hard to pick a genre for this movie. It's like Horror, Action and Comedy all rolled up into 1 movie. There are parts that are ""thrilling"" along with parts that will make you laugh your ass off. Other parts may make you cringe in pain, and not want to go to the bathroom for weeks. And one specific part will have the entire audience stand up and cheer.Now, if you are looking for some work of it or masterpiece of a movie then this is not for you. This is not the next ""Sixth Sense"" or ""Citizen Kane"", this is just a fun film for you to watch with your friends. Yes, the plot may be thin but really, who watches a movie called ""Snakes on a Plane"" and expects some deep movie? There are snakes, on a plane. That's the plot. Though, for you movie whores out there, they do explain why the snakes are on the plane and why they are attacking people, but really, does it matter?If you are looking for a fun film to watch with friends to have a great time, this is for you. If you are someone who takes movies really seriously and expects a deep plot and tragic ending, look away. For the rest of us, this movie is a blast.",Snakes on a Plane

She laughed, and ooh'd and did jump out of the seat once.Great movie. See it!One disturbing note, and I don't want to come off like a prude, but the people next to us brought three children, all easily under 8 years old.

Also, it doesn't hurt to see it with fifteen-or-so friends. But the ten comes from the experience and the experience alone. Go see snakes (on a plane) in a theater with the right atmosphere (and the right people) and you will not be disappointed. One of my friends who came with me is about to get on a plane for France at six o'clock  eighteen hours after the movie started  with a pounding headache and about four hours of sleep.

I would highly suggest seeing this movie, Samuel L. Jackson was a perfect guy for this movie, he helped bring this already crazy movie to life.The movie starts out like nothings wrong and then boom, the film starts and never stops, It's that good, hilarious death scenes, and just hilarious moments, and of course hilarious lines, from more than just Samuel L. Jackson, everybody in this movie helps bring the concept of snakes on a plane to life. This is a must see!",Snakes on a Plane
765,xxromstaxx,Life Changing Experience...,10,18 August 2006,"This film could very well be one of my favorite movies. Seriously. The many people who have doubted this film have to ask themselves this: ""Have I ever seen a movie where the entire audience waited for one line to be said, and when that line was actually said, the entire audience screamed along with it and burst into cheers."" I swear this movie made be laugh harder than I've laughed during a movie in a very long time. Every death by snake was well thought out and changed up for every character (the sexual type deaths were hilarious; you'll have to see it to understand). I'm not usually a laugh out loud kind of person; when I see a comedy, I'll think it was funny or smile but I'll never really find myself laughing. I couldn't help myself in Snakes On a Plane; I was laughing myself to tears every second of the movie.Honestly, I've never been to a movie where the audience was that interactive with the movie. I went to the midnight premieres of Star Wars episodes 1,2 and 3 and no one got into the movie half as much as SOAP. Just because Samuel L. Jackson opened his mouth, the entire theater burst into laughter. It was so funny because of how seriously Jackson took it, but how ridiculous he was in the movie. People were so happy to see Samuel destroy snake after snake and then deliver some ""one liner"" that was hilarious and witty. Just because a snake was killed by a likable character, people clapped and cheered. Well, strangely, whenever some one died, people clapped and cheered. It was scene after scene of pure entertainment and by the end of the movie I wished that there was more and I didn't have to leave.I'm going to see it again today and I hope to see all of you there! Please by a ticket for this film and enjoy a great experience. For the people who think this movie will be so stupid, please get past your pride, get yourself a bag of popcorn, and see this movie!

YES. You have to go see this movie knowing that it was designed to be a B movie... it's supposed to be bad. It won't win any Oscars. With that out of the way, go see this movie and prepare to have fun. Crazy things happen to undeserving people, and even the most horrible (things that truly make you cringe... especially if you're a guy!) can evoke laughs.Don't wait for the DVD, and don't download it. Part of the experience of this movie is sitting in a crowded theater that is laughing, jumping, and screaming with you. You simply can't get as much fun out of this film if you're sitting at home. If you're going to see this movie, see it now, while there are still crowds... don't wait for it to get the to dollar theater and watch it by yourself.This movie was a blast, and one of the weirdest, most amazing experiences at the movies.",Snakes on a Plane
767,ssshhhhhhnakes,Don't buy yourself popcorn for this popcorn-movie...,8,7 September 2006,"Before I went to see this movie in cinema I bought myself a huge bag of popcorn. Honestly, what a big mistake that was I recognized during the scene when all the snakes were released and started to molest the passengers of the Pacific Air Flight 121 Honolulu-L.A. From that point on I was so under the spell of the going-ons on the screen that I even feared there could be snakes in my popcorn bag!!! So by now you might know which opinion I have about ""Snakes on a Plane"" (2006, directed by David R. Ellis). The idea of this flick is very freaky what I liked, of course, even if it's unimaginable that this could happen in reality. I'm pretty sure that nowadays before every flight there is security staff who precisely check the luggage and all other things people want to take with them. I'm not quite sure whether you can turn a normal dangerous snake into an above average dangerous snake by sprinkling it with pheromones, either. I just hope that people don't start focusing all their hate onto snakes now and kill them senselessly, because they are still creatures of our planet, even if they can be dangerous. It's still a salving feeling that you have to look up crazy places to meet the real deadly ones whose venom will kill you in seconds.What I also liked about ""Snakes..."" was the introduction of all the important passengers, so that you get to know their characters a little bit better before the plane takes off. I guess the screenwriters had to do that so that you are with all these persons when all the snakes overrun the whole airplane. The role of Rachel Blanchard who plays a young millionaire named Mercedes Harbont who takes her Chihuahua dog with her on that flight must have been a reference to Paris Hilton and her beloved Tinkerbell. That Chihuahua also includes the most spiteful scene of all, naturally caused by a human-being.There actually were some scenes which frightened me so much that I hoped none of the other spectators were mad and would put snakes out of their rucksacks (I looked at all the spectators who went to cinema with rucksacks very distrustful). The scene which ""goose-pimpled"" me the most was the one where the snake bit one woman who just opened her mouth to eat something in the tongue.If your dream is to visit Hawaii you just can't understand why the one guy in the beginning is so angry with his just-married wife about her choice to spend the honeymoon there since the pictures of that island were just gorgeous. This is one movie you got to see in the cinema to feel its whole tension.

I was expecting the cheesy lines, and the predictable actions (and re-actions) of the characters, but knowing I was going into a movie that was hyped as ""so bad, it's good!"" made it easier to ignore logic and just enjoy myself. Seeing it with a big gang of friends certainly didn't hinder that enjoyment either. In fact, I don't think i would've enjoyed it as much if I didn't have 6 other people laughing their asses off right along with me! And having the entire audience yell out THAT line along with Sam Jackson was incredibly amusing. ""Snakes on a Plane""- I don't know if I'd label it a ""Best Worst"" movie (it's no Deathrace 2000); I think I honestly liked it too much for that. I found it hilarious, campy, and gratifying. It's a must-see for B-is-for-bad movie fans, and mainstream followers will get a kick out of it too. Just for fun: bring along a pocket full of rubber snakes.

The plot doesn't make any actual sense, of course, nor do the actions of any of the characters. It points it will make you laugh uproariously, groan at the deliberately lame predictability, or even shield your eyes from unnecessarily disgusting snake attacks.

It could go either way... we could have a string of ""Snakes on a xxxxxxx"" movies or ""xxxxx on a Plane"". The possibilities are endless. However, I think most snake bite scenarios have been covered in the multiple gruesome snake bite scenes during the first 30 minutes of SOaP.

Frickin' Oscar-award winning performances? I think not. However, the movie was not ""campy"", it was ""fresh"". They took a ridiculous concept and turned it into a hilarious movie. In short, it was great. The actors all worked well with what they were given. Jackson was great, as usual. The lead actress was sweet and admirable. The lady with the dog was downright obnoxious. I kept hoping she'd get eaten. They wasted no time getting graphic - within the first twenty minutes blood, partial nudity, and profanity were all in full swing. It's not a movie you have to think about. It's a movie for pure enjoyment.",Snakes on a Plane

I was left speechless when it was over. It may look cheesy but it's absolutely amazing, if of course, you have a sense of humor. Samuel L. Jackson plays it cool as usual and brings even more fun to this adventure. Every single time you think that nothing more frightening or crazy could happen, it does. There's no down time like in other action or horror flicks, this is pure action and fun. You'll love it. It's worth every penny of the ticket price that you so often bitch about. It's worth more. Go see it. Only then will you understand.",Snakes on a Plane

I thought it would be really good. Well, this movie blew all my expectations away. Snakes on a Plane is absolutely brilliant. A person couldn't ask for more in a movie. I left the theater thinking to myself, ""Wow, I think this is the most entertaining movie I have ever seen"". Sure, Star Wars was awesome, Lord of the Rings rocked. But, Snakes on a Plane is in a movie category of it's own. I felt like I was in a horror movie cleverly drenched in brilliant comedy. The movie had me both laughing uncontrollably and sitting tense on the edge of my seat. Few movies accomplish what Snakes on a Plane does.If there is only one movie you see all year... wait, if there is only one movie you see this decade, Snakes on a Plane should definitely be it.

Although, now it's going to pointless to go to the theaters because there is nothing that can top this and they shouldn't even try.Anyway, in this excellent movie, there are scenes of a graphic nature that are so over-the-top that they become hilarious. I have never seen so many laughs in a movie theater. There is something for everyone in this movie. Action, Suspense, Comedy, Romance, Horror, Drama.The only real question that remains is whether this movie will be nominated for awards under the drama or comedy category.

As a fan and contributor of the internet sites that made this movie what it is, like fark, I had to go see it just for what I thought would be a cheesy action movie.Maybe it was that the movie was so much better than what I was expecting, or that it was just really funny, but it surprised me so much that I think it deserves 10 stars.SoaP was truly a shining trophy to just how much the internet can do. The movie was full of hilarious scenes, and was totally targeted to your 20-30 year old typical online geek. In my opinion, this movie could really be titled as a comedy. I do think this movie will excel in its comedy if you've followed the SoaP ""fan-dom"" prior to its release.I haven't had that much fun at a movie all year.",Snakes on a Plane

After the first half hour each new scene becomes something of a guilty pleasure, but, when in doubt, just laugh... You'll feel Better.Seeing ""Snakes On a Plane"" in full premier-experience, it was as if I was dreaming, because this movie is nothing like any other movie I've ever seen, or any movie I'll ever see again.Don't accept your initial judgment on this movie, you'll regret it.",Snakes on a Plane

I very much encourage going to this movie while its still bringing in a lot of people to the theater. The movie starts out in an overdone attempt to build the story, creating a so-bad-its-good tone that will last throughout the movie. Then come the snakes. Personally, I think that the $7 I spent seeing the movie was worth it just for the first kill alone. From there, Samuel L. Jackson steals the show. He has an instantly classic movie line in ""Enough is enough. I've had it with these mothaf****n' snakes on this mothaf*****n' PLANE!"".

But it's one of those movies that's fun and entertaining. Not a masterpiece. It's really cool and it keeps you on the edge of your seat, but it's not the most incredible movie I've ever seen. It doesn't make 'Alien' or some other classic Horror/Thriller look like crap. In fact, it doesn't even compare. Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie. I walked out of the theater wanting more. And I think that's what most people will do. I think it's an awesome, scary, suspenseful, entertaining, cool movie. I just don't want to over hype it so that fans will get built up like it's the greatest movie on earth, and that it's better than the classics, and then be knocked down when they see a cool movie. I'd say it's great, not amazing. It's cool but not a classic. And I'd say don't make the movie seem better than it is. I think since this was so internet crazy, it's going to be huge. And I don't think it's what most fans were expecting. I think the fans thought it would be a stupid, cheesy movie. I think they'll be surprised that it's actually entertaining.

Lastly, we have the trailer, which provides all of the highlights. With these given, we can all engage in a trance-state that will induce possible, or probable, situations that could have transpired inside this ""film"" that are actually better than the film itself. With that said, it is difficult to imagine that there is any reason to go to the cinema to view this film. In fact, if one is to visit the cinema where this movie is playing, it is unlikely that you will be able to view the film. You may remember seeing the title on the marquee, standing in line and purchasing a ticket, and even being ushered to a seat. You may be treated to a few car commercials and Fandango promotions and receive a glimpse of some previews. However once the film begins, it is reasonable to predict, that you will be treated to nothing more than a review of the simulated memories that you have yourself produced in preparation for the viewing of this film. In short the film itself does not exist. It cannot exist. You laugh. You say, ""Well, of course it exists, I just saw a preview. In fact I just sat through the movie."" However dear reader, let us propose that it is possible for you to now, at this moment, predict a sizable portion of this film. Is it not possible for you to picture Samuel L. Jackson reciting some of his famous lines - 'You're G**D*** right I'm mad!' or 'Yes they - the snakes - deserve to die, and I hope they burn in hell!' Wouldn't that be funny? Yes, it is.

I went to see this movie expecting no plot and a lot of snakes. To my amazement there was a plot there was lots of snakes a comedy with some killer lines. It will definitely be the number one movie this weekend. Props to the producers for not previewing this movie to critics with pickles up their asses because they would definitely try to destroy it. There will be a cult following to this flick and I'm sure there will be a sequel.I definitely recommend this movie for any one with a sense of humor.--------(:)~,Snakes on a Plane

Jackson finally said his line that everyone had been waiting for, everyone cheered! It was awesome ;) I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone..unless your uncomfortable with snakes eating people left and right. This movie was so funny and had a good story line. A year before this movie came out, I heard about it, but i honestly thought that it would be so stupid because of it's title that easily sums up the movie. The idea looked so ridiculous at first so I thought I would just laugh at how crappy it was, but I was also very excited to see it. When i finally saw it, I was shocked about how amazing it was.After that, everyone is waiting for a sequel. Well, we have thought up quite a few: Snakes on a Plane 2: snakes in the cargo. Snakes on a Boat. Snakes in a Car. Pirates of the Caribbean 4: Snakes in the Treasure (where Samuel L. Jackson gets to say ""There's ******-******* snakes in the ******-******* treasure!""Go see it as soon as possible!-JaKe",Snakes on a Plane

Its worth seeing if only for the creative first bites which both amuse and gross out the viewer. Guys, I suggest you take a deep breath before the second one, but you'll see it coming enough to cover your eyes if you are too empathetic. ;D The brief topless scene may make up for this insult to the male anatomy. If you really hate snakes it may give you nightmares, but otherwise the film is more amusing and jumpy then truly scary.

And those of you who are trashing this movie really need to un-serious your business. This movie is supposed to be a fun, action-filled plane movie packed with snakes who like to bite people in curious places, not a movie that has an Oscar-winning story behind it.

Yesterday, I thought it would be a cheesy, low-budget B movie surrounded by a whole load of hype. Tonight,I stand corrected. Samuel L. Jackson does what he does best, and plays the part with intensity, and an integrity you wouldn't expect for a film of this nature. David R. Ellis manages to make the story engrossing and believable, without being overly serious.

This is probably the best movie I have ever seen in theater. Not because in terms of a great movie quality, but in the fact that I have never had that much fun at a theater in my life.

It's funny just with all the lines and some of the snake attacks, such as the biting of the boob.In all seriousness though, it was a good movie. Oddly, the CG snakes didn't bother me.

798,rennie12,wonderful,10,19 August 2006,"I am a movie serious movie buff; one movie a week since ten years old.This one is a genuine classic - how it can come so close to parody and yet not be one is amazing.It is has overtones of Indiana Jones and Airplane without being like either. It is just serious entertainment, and in so doing is actually excellent art of its own. Does anybody remember that Shakespeare was popular entertainment, made for money ? This thing is nowhere NEAR as bloody as much of Shakespeare.In fact the R rating seems to be based mostly on a single sentence, which has a word in it (twice) which every American alive has heard in real life many, many times. There is some violence, death, and blood in it but it is by no means a horror flick, and certainly FAR less serious sex and violence than, say, ""A History of Violence"".Incidentally - though I see a movie a week - ""Snakes on a Plane"" and ""A History of Violence"" are the only two movies I have seen in 2006 which I unreservedly recommend. I have left, bored, about half the movies this year - ""Pirates of the Carib 2"" being an example, and ""The Producers"" another. This year's ""King Kong"" was watchable. I give this info about me so you can judge my opinion of SOAP.Samuel Jackson does his usual excellent job in a part tailored for Wesley Snipes, even to the hints of mixed-race romance.If you love movies there is nothing here not to like; the same if you just want entertainment.Snooty critics will hate it.

A bit of romance, sex, violence, bad language, terror and even a good plot. What more could you want? It was exciting, yet scary. Happy, yet sad.I am a woman over the age of 50, so when the critics said only 16 year old boys would like this film, they were WRONG. I intend to tell all my friends to see it.

Last place on earth that this could happen. there are NO snakes in Hawaii. None in the zoo, none are native, none are allowed to be brought in (legally), hopefully, none kept as pets. Snakes are not even allowed to be transported through any Hawaii airport! So why do these snakes appear on a flight that was supposed to originate in Hawaii? the writers could have chosen about ANYWHERE ELSE.

802,hickoxb2,snakes on a plane = awesome. go see it. right now.,9,19 August 2006,"unlike most other people that have posted their reviews in here, i didn't even really know about this movie until about a month ago (or so) when i saw pirates 2 for the second time, and there was a trailer for it. me and my friends in the movie just looked at each other and laughed. none of us took it seriously. i wasn't planning on seeing it at all, until Thursday when my friend was raving about it to me, and who has very similar taste in movies that i do (dodgeball, anchorman, pulp fiction, etc). so i decided that i would see it. i finally saw it tonight (saturday) with a couple friends (its a little after midnight right now). anyways, so we got into the theater and it was only about a third full. that made us kind of skeptical, as we had seen Talladega nights (which has been out longer) last night (friday) and it was packed.OK now to the actual movie. i loved most of it (even the beginning, though people keep trashing the acting). it was great. I've seen ""smart"" movies, where I've had to ask friends what was happening every 10 seconds. this was different. i could focus on the pure entertainment of the movie. it is an interesting blend of comedy, drama, and horror, all in one, held together by SLJ. whats amazing about it is it never let down. i know that in at least one point in most movies i see, i lose focus, and look away, at my watch, exit signs, etc. i didn't budge this time. it was entertaining from beginning till end. i can say lots of awesome things about this movie, but by now you've probably already read WAY too much of that.instead i will focus more on the bad parts (though there were few). but don't get me wrong. i LOVED the movie. this is where the spoilers come in. first, what was Sean doing at that deserted bridge in Hawaii at the beginning of the movie anyways? it seemed kind of random and not well-planned. then there was the part when SLJ says to Sean ""do what i say, and you'll live"" or something to that extent when they are fleeing from ""Eddie's"" thugs. what was Jackson (or ""Flynn"") doing for the time before Sean ran out onto his back deck/porch thing? that also seemed kind of random. then, right at the end of the movie, Sean got ""bit"" by a snake as he was about to slide down off the plane after it landed. did anyone else notice how he started bleeding after it bit him? then, of course, Flynn shot the snake off him and he went tumbling down the yellow slide thing. so if he got bit by a snake, why is it that after he took off his bloody shirt, there was not a scratch on his body? thats just me though. then there was the glaring hole at the end of the movie. i felt a little bit empty when we didn't find out what happened to Eddie (I'm drawing a blank on his last name right now). the whole plot (what little there was) was based on taking him down and sending him to prison/death. we never find out what happens to him. that would have been a MUCH better ending.OK I'm tired right now, so I'm going to bed, but the bottom line is SEE SNAKES ON A PLANE! i give it a 9/10",Snakes on a Plane

If anyone plans on coming into the movie expecting some serious acting, a good storyline, or pretty much anything where the makers of the movie try to be like every other serious movie ever, then you have a problem... I mean, its called SNAKES ON A PLANE. You know everyone behind the scenes was laughing just as hard making the movie as everyone that was watching it and got what the creators were going for. This movie creates a brand new category of motion picture, because it has the look of an action/horror movie, but its not meant to be a serious movie. It is simply a comedy with the look of an action/horror film. I decided to name the genre, ""Unintentional Comedy."" (anyone else with ideas for a name comment on this wall) It looks like its not supposed to be funny, but if you watch it, it actually is quite hilarious.

I would have given this movie the rating -4, but since this isn't allowed it gets off with a heartbreaking 1. This movie reeks, it isn't even remotely funny, it has no exciting plot what so ever and it's supposed to be a cult movie. The Movie starts rather OK, with a guy witnessing a mobster-like assassination, after that it turns into crap. 90% of all the snakes you see in the movie is fake (CG-rendered) and the alive ones doesn't make up for the 90% fake-snakes, they are rather sluggish in comparison to the computer animated ones, giving the movie yet another thumbs down. The plot has no realism to it, it's only based upon man's fear of snakes, take all of the campfire-stories you've ever heard and put them into a movie, add a plane, and then your almost done. Furthermore, the snakes doesn't react normal, they are hyper aggressive and apparently they have ten times the amount of poison as the usual snakes. The true nature of the snake is to run and hide, preferably somewhere warm and cozy, which is the direct opposite of the passengers cabin. But as every other movie in it's genre it has an explanation for this behavior, Pheromone, Which makes these snakes go Berzerk. When i first heard about it i thought; It's with Samuel the man, Can't be bad... Boy was i wrong, don't let that fool you. This is not the same as Jay And Silent Bob Strikes Back, Chasing Amy and Mallrats, which i was very fond of. This is one of those times where movie makers and famous actors gives them selves the possibility to make a quick buck.In conclusion, this movie is a genuine mistake, god help the fool that think this is indeed a hit in the cult-genre.

The thing that is the strongest fact about this movie is that isn't going for any of that Oscar bullshit, its for the fans. ah hell if weren't for the fans then we'd all be talking about PACIFIC AIR 121(rated pg-13) but thanks to us we have OUR movie.It knows you didn't come to see the trials of a Hawaiian gangster, or the feelings of a man who's vacation was cut short, or especially the trials of an FBI agent. This is mother f*ckin snakes on a mother f*ckin plane. Once i saw the first attack i laughed out loud with my friend and the whole audience. we both agreed at that point, this was the best movie ever. Now recently i had been thinking that cinema is dead dude to all the remakes of classic or Japanese films. and all of the recent comedies sucked(40 year old virgin? Wedding crashers? the ringer??) but this sets an example for Hollywood.It should remind them of what made movies fun in the first place. The fact that it has but one goal, fan service. now it also did another job i didn't expect, it wiped the floor of every other movie that i had seen before. i was excited for Crank( i still somewhat am) but i cannot stop buzzing about snake on a plane! the descent was pretty cool, but then again Sam Jackson rocked his heart out. there are two things that stole the spotlight of the film together...(sir)Sam Jackson and the mother f*ckin snakes. once you go see it don't don't try to understand all the trivial thing or expect metaphor es or examine the movie. Because this is a roller-coaster ride and if you attempt to take it apart and examine what makes it so fun for everyone else all that you will see are scraps of metal.",Snakes on a Plane

There is nothing better then having Sammy kick the crap out of some mother f***ing snakes on a mother f***ing plane. I agree with many of the other comments that say it is better to go with a large group of friends. It makes it even funnier. When i went kids were so hyped up about it that right before the movie started, 2 kids showed up as Samuel L Jackson and a plane covered in snakes. We instantly broke out in laughter applauding and cheering them on theater. Now grant it, if a ""so bad its good"" type of movie is not your thing, then don't see it, but if your into cheesy lines and special effects then this is the movie for you.

I""m a woman and I LOVED IT! (So try not to write sexist stuff in your reviews like this, Pete Simone (ps42) ,because surprise, surprise, some women (like me) loved this movie too.) It's okay though. I agree the movie was full of ""manly entertainment."" But it's good for anyone who likes thriller movies and hates snakes. I hated snakes before I saw this movie, and I hate them even more now.

Jackson put his foot down. I was so excited to see it, that as soon as I found out when it would be out, I started telling people to go see it. Lots of naysayers out there tried to stop me from going, but it was honestly one of the most exciting and best movies I have seen. It is sure to be a classic, if only for its title. All my friends who have seen it loved it, and it has a killer song written about it! Props to Cobra Starship for their awesomeness in performing the music. This movie is amazing!",Snakes on a Plane
813,thorfy,"If you like planes, snakes, Samuel L. Jackson or small children, please don't see this movie",1,22 August 2006,"Oh Dear Lord, How on Earth was any part of this film ever approved by anyone? It reeks of cheese from start to finish, but it's not even good cheese. It's the scummiest, moldiest, most tasteless cheese there is, and I cannot believe there is anyone out there who actually, truly enjoyed it. Yes, if you saw it with a load of drunk/stoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way, but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen. I watched it with an up-for-a-few-laughs guy, having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the film's expected crapness. We got the crapness (plenty of it), but not the chuckles. It doesn't even qualify as a so-bad-it's-good movie. It's just plain bad. Very, very bad. Here's why (look away if you're spoilerphobic): The movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death. OK, I was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was, but I think I grasped the 'this guy is a bit of a badass who you don't want to mess with' message behind the ingenious scene. Oh, and a guy witnesses it. So, we already have our ultra-evil bad guy, and wussy but cute (apparently) good guy. Cue Hero. Big Sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion, saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish, i.e. Hero is immune to bullets, everyone else falls over rather clumsily. Cue first plot hole. How the bloody hell did Sammy know where this guy was, or that he'd watched the murder. Perhaps this, and the answers to all my plot-hole related questions, was explained in the 2 minutes before I got into the cinema, but I doubt it. In fact, I'm going to stop poking holes in the plot right here, lest I turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese (which we all know is good cheese). So, the 'plot' (a very generous word to use). Good guy must get to LA, evil guy would rather he didn't, Hero Sam stands between the two. Cue scenery for the next vomit-inducing hour - the passenger plane. As I said, no more poking at plot holes, I'll just leave it there. Passenger plane. Next, the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie, and what makes it everything it is - Snakes. Yay! Oh, pause. First we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have. Hot, horny couple (see if you can guess how they die), dead-before-any-snakes-even-appear British guy (those pesky Brits, eh?), cute kids, and Jo Brand. For all you Americans that's an English comic famous for her size and unattractiveness. Now that we've met the cast, let's watch all of them die (except of course the cute kids). Don't expect anything original, it's just snake bites on various and ever-increasingly hilarious (really not) parts of the body. Use your imagination, since the film-makers obviously didn't use theirs.So, that's most of the film wrapped up, so now for the best bit, the ending. As expected, everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face. Yep, Ice-cool Sammy included. But wait, we're not all off the plane yet! The last guy to get off is good guy, but just as he does he gets bitten by a (you guessed it) snake (of all things). Clearly this one had been hiding in Mr. Jackson's hair the whole time, since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier, despite the 200ft constrictor (the one that ate that pesky British bugger) being unable to. So, Sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop. At this point I prayed that the movie was about to make a much-needed U-turn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort. But no. In a kind of icing on the cake way (but with stale cheese, remember), it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest. How anyone can think that an audience 10 years ago, let alone in 2006 would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me, but it did well in summing up the film.Actually, we're not quite done yet. After everyone has sucked face (Uncle Sam with leading actress, good guy with Tiffany, token Black guy with token White girl, and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia), it's time for good guy and hero to get it on....In Bali!!! Nope, it wasn't at all exciting, the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll. Yes, the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred, and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times. That's it. This is the first time I've ever posted a movie review, but I felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography. If you like planes, snakes, Samuel L.Jackson, air hostesses, bad guys, surfing, dogs in bags or English people, then please, please don't see this movie. It will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that you'll never want to come into contact with any of them ever again. Go see United 93 instead. THAT was good.",Snakes on a Plane

We couldn't decide between that or World Trade Center because I don't handle scary movies very well but we weren't in the mood to sob hysterically. Well, as almost every other review has said, Samuel L. Jackson is incredible, and his cast members do pretty well too. I commend them for realistically looking like they are being savaged by extremely poisonous snakes. But (and I know all you action/horror movie lovers are gonna shake your heads) there is so many horrifying snake attacks in this movie that I almost vomited. I had to watch a majority of the film from the door because the carnage was so horrendous. My friends were fine, of course. They were freaking out as well, but they could stay in their chairs. But we had all expected this movie to comically be a disaster! Who knew that 'snakes on a plane' could be made into an (almost) credible event! It's not impossible that the pheromones sprayed on every Laia the lovely Hawaiian lady gave to almost every passenger, made the snakes ultra aggressive and horny(""So basically we've got snakes on crack.""). I guess I just couldn't stomach a woman, bit on the tongue, choking and suffocating on her swollen tongue, a pusing eye socket, a high heel broken off in a downed man's ear, or a trapped couple being repeatedly struck by snakes while trapped by the beverage cart screaming in pain and terror. This movie is not just a cool Samuel L Jackson movie, it's carnage that's genuine proof of how desensitized we really are.",Snakes on a Plane

I smacked my forehead when the kid left the crime scene prematurely (DUH!) and laughed when Sam showed up to save the day. I cried when the veteran flight attendant died in her aura of beatific martyrdom.

I sadly wasn't able to be with friends who were wanting to see it. But I'll be sure to get them to come with me the next time I go (which will be tomorrow). I hope many of you reading this will go to see it. Samuel is great and the action is never ending. Just when you think it's slowing down, it hits you with more and doesn't stop.

There is also a part where he says ""You mean to tell me we've got snakes on crack!"". This movie also contains a germ freak rapper, a ditsy blonde with her dog, a couple who join the mile high club, a bad ass kick boxer, Champ from anchorman, every body's favorite black man (Samuel L.

The green lighting change gives increased excitement when you just know one of the passengers is about to be brutally attacked.

It's one of those movies that would be like taking something we use almost everyday and love, like a toaster, and adding flashing lights to it... so that we use it more often as well as convincing us that the toast tastes a lot better.SoAP is actually really funny as well... and not because it's so utterly ridiculous (which is what you expect to get most of the laughs from), but it does actually have some good humour in it (as well as the obvious humour that DOES come from the ridiculous plot).The most surprising thing about SoAP is that the plot does actually - if you can believe it - get a bit more complicated than just putting snakes onto a plane, but not by much. This gives the movie a bit of substance and adds some suspense as well.To anyone who hasn't yet seen this movie, I advise rushing out of your house immediately and bursting into your nearest cinema and DEMANDING to see this movie.

I was laughing through out the whole movie instead of being scared. It was funny how the snakes would search for particular section of the passengers body to attack for example, the eye, the tongue, the butt, the breast. If we have seen national geographic channel we know snakes wont stay clinched on the body once they bite. For each particular scene the snakes would bite the passengers and would stay on the body biting the person. I believe the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior.

It plays with instincts, but the computer animated snakes have such an unnatural behaviour that any impact on the spectator is immediately destroyed. I wonder why Samuel L. Jackson participates in such a low production. Waste of time and money. Go to dinner directly and order something more expensive. The snakes preferably attack genitals (!), eyeballs, and cute dogs. There is no such thing as a story to the movie, as all revolves for 70 Minutes of the movie around people rolling on the floor being bitten in the most unlikely places and snakes falling out of the oxygen mask cabinets by the dozen. The snakes manage even to tamper with the flight control system of the 747. Great. I tend to watch all movies to the end to give the director the chance to make something up, but here...no way.

824,ibroadrunr,"entertaining enough, but without focus",7,26 August 2006,"This movie is what it claims...lots of snakes on a plane(!). And really, that's pretty cool just for the WTF factor.But it has two big problems:1. They really did go with the ""this premise alone is enough to win status among the hip"" mentality. Put snakes on a plane, explore almost every idea that follows, and add a moderate dose of underlying self-mockery. The movie doesn't know what to do with itself at times, though, occasionally opting for pure shock value and laughs, and occasionally taking itself more seriously. This odd mixture felt confused to me. IMHO, it would've benefited from a more consistent tone.2. Perhaps most importantly, the snakes...aren't very convincing or scary. The CG is pretty lousy, in fact. And were 450 live snakes really used? Coulda fooled me. If you're gonna' making a film solely about snakes on a plane, I want to see a lot of damn snakes on a plane.I guess my overall feeling is that they tried too hard not to try. Geeky cult movies are better when they're accidents: movies that aimed higher than they hit or that genuinely thought a goofy idea was plausible, so that to some degree we're laughing at the film AND at the filmmakers. Here, the filmmakers just want us to laugh with them. Yet neither do they deliver the self-conscious comedy of, say, Airplane! or even Scary Movie. Maybe I'm just being an old-school snob, but I wish SoaP would have gone with one style or the other.Also, it FELT like they took a PG-13 movie and added a few thrills to 'earn' an R rating. That added somewhat to the disjointed feeling, although this complaint is more minor for me. (Besides, who am I to object to senseless nudity and gore?)All that said, there are a few very funny lines (fewer than I expected) and some great ""unh-uh, you did NOT just do that"" moments.

I know it probably covers a multitude of filming sins, but it drives me crazy. Must be something like a strobe light to an epileptic.

829,u3344672,Almost as bad as House of the Dead,1,29 August 2006,"OK, yes this contains spoilers, but the movie is entirely predictable anyway.Am I wasting my time with this review? The producers don't actually need paying customers to watch this film, as it seems to have been entirely paid for by product placement (think Red Bull cans popping up in completely absurd places). So if you, like me, are tricked by Samuel L. Jackson's name on the cast list, the fact that snakes are cool, or if you think it might be as good as the ultra-crap but fun Turbulence movies, please let me dissuade you from seeing it.I have always been afraid of snakes. I have nightmares about rooms full of snakes, about exotic snakes biting me, chasing me etc. I should also say that I am incredibly easily scared by even the stupidest of horror movies. This movie did not scare me in the slightest, apart from being so utterly terrible that it scares me so many people have given it 10/10. OK and yes, I am a woman, but let me assure you that my boyfriend and his friend (a guy) also thought it was dreadful.The movie opens with shots of chicks in bikinis on a Hawaiian beach, followed by a really boring montage of surfing shots. From that moment I knew I was in for one of the tackiest movies I've ever seen. The above-mentioned unsubtle shots of Red Bull cans, seconds into the movie, confirmed this.Other low points include a snake biting a woman on her naked breast (trust me, not as erotic as it sounds, though I accept that it could have been) while she is ""joining the mile high club""  I mean seriously, is there anything more clichéd  a snake biting a man while he is using the toilet (guess where?), stereotypical black banter and British snobbery, and a completely impossible scene involving a pressurised cabin, a hole in the side of the plane and an extremely large man-eating python. Can I please stress  none of this is remotely funny.Don't get me wrong  I know this movie isn't serious, I know a lot of people will forgive the complete lack of plot, the inexplicable and idiotic plot devices, Samuel L Jackson's tiresome use of the word ""motherf*cker"", the total absurdity of the situation (which could actually have been a strength), the stupid happy ending (where the triads all mysteriously lose interest in killing our hero) and the mindless and cruel destruction of domestic pets.But add to all that complete tastelessness, constant insults to the intelligence of the audience, the complete lack of originality or cleverness and a dreadful music video during the closing credits, and you have one of the worst movies I have ever seen (and I've seen House of the Dead!).",Snakes on a Plane

They.Found.A.Way.This was a movie loaded up with venom all right, but it had less to do with the snakes than it did with the director. That man has some issues with people in general to work through.From a positively raunchy sex scene that exists only to show a snake biting a woman's nipple (a scene which is promptly balanced by a snake latching onto a man's penis), to a snake inadvertently pleasuring a fat woman and then biting her in the eyeball, this movie reeks of hatred. The movie revels in punishing it's on-screen cast to the point where it's almost physically painful to watch. You get the impression that the director really hates the hypochondriac who conquers his fear of flying only because his wife wanted to go to Hawaii for their honeymoon, and that the only reason the baby survived was because there'd be too much controversy. (As it was, we got a compromise and are treated to watching a 10-year-old boy's arm swell up and ooze pus from a snake bite.) I've watched and enjoyed good-bad, aka Campy movies. I love Evil Dead 2, I own Tremors and Tremors 2 on DVD. If it features weird things done by cheap special effects, I'm all over it. But I'm not enough of a sadist to enjoy a movie that makes a point of killing off the most sympathetic characters in the most painful ways imaginable-- all in the first reel.A lot of people will try to tell you this is a good-bad movie. It's not. It's simply a bad movie, and I recommend avoiding it. If you want something so-bad-it's-fun, rent Army of Darkness-- or anything associated with the Raimi brothers.",Snakes on a Plane

I'm not telling anyone what happens or anything because i want you to watch the movie yourself I'm telling you, you will love it no matter what. wait! reword that, if you are a person that gets scared easily or gets nightmares you might not go because there are lots of gross parts in the movie and a lot of parts where a snakes just pop out!.. I'm not the kind of people that get scared and all but i've got to tell you this i get grossed really really easily example i cant see people getting bit or hurt I don't know why but i cant and during the movie my friends were cracking up because when a snake attacked i would cover my eyesbut i saw what was happening;) for me it wasn't scary maybe only gross but not VERY gross so i loved it and it is one of the best movie i've watched so far:P...well i just wanted to tell you even if u get grossed easily u'll love it seriously i bet you will well i just hope you watch it and post a comment about your opinion so we all no what you thought of it.!

832,tim-service,"Fast paced action-thriller, which also makes you think ...",10,31 August 2006,"John Hefferman's script delves deeper into the human psyche than you might expect in this challenging, emotional and insightful thriller. 'Snakes on a Plane' is a story of our times, powerfully portraying the insecurity and terror which shapes our fast-paced 21st-century lives. Substitute the snakes for Islamic fundamentalists, and the true message becomes apparent. We are confronted by a hostile and alien enemy, which secretly lies dormant in our midst, only to suddenly and unexpectedly strike with its frightening venom, with devastating and deadly effect. That our passengers cannot communicate with the snakes, and that they show no mercy even to the innocent women and children, only serves to underscore the allegory.Samuel L Jackson takes the lead, his character representing the saviour of civilised democracy - a quasi-George Bush character, if you will - who shows no mercy in ridding the plane of its desperate, heartless snakes. He is ably supported by a diverse, talented and yet relatively unknown supporting cast, who provide a realistic backdrop to this 30,000ft thriller. The dialogue is fast-paced and pithy, and avoids the usually clichéd lines which typically define this genre. Effects are flawless too - never has CGI looked more convincing.All in, this is the surprising sleeper hit of the summer blockbuster season - exciting yet intelligent, funny yet moving. 10/10",Snakes on a Plane

Some funny scenes other than that the film is a waste of time.,1,1 September 2006,I gave it a rating of 1 out of 10 even though i think it should be given 3.5 but I am doing so because the average ratings are a joke. Please do not fall for those ratings. I fell for the ratings on IMDb and went and saw the film yesterday and it was absolutely awful. Please do not fall for the ratings given by pranksters. There are some funny scenes and dialogues but the snakes were just used to make the film really gruesome. The characters have no depth and at the end of the film you don't remember the plot or the characters but just the snakes. Samuel L. Jackson was absolutely wasted in this film. Unfortunately he was used as a big name to sell the film. Do not waste your time watching this film and remember if this film becomes successfully we would only be encouraging them to make more films like this.,Snakes on a Plane

What we found was just that, and we haven't stopped talking about it, recalling scenes and lines that were truly entertaining and memorable. Samuel L. Jackson, with his dialogue and mannerisms, makes the entire movie. We gave SoaP 8 out of 10 stars for its diversionary value, not its cinematic method and structure. Life's too serious to begin with!

I found myself laughing hysterically and also when Jackson says the brill line ""Enough is enough, I've had it wit these mother..... snakes on this mother.... plane"" me and my mates found almost the whole cinema applauding.

I seriously about fell out of my chair laughing. Other then Samuel L. Jackson the acting was terrible. It was probably one of the most ridiculous plots I've ever heard of. The sex scene was pointless. They could have gotten an R rating with just the language. I guess they figured since the movie was so bad they might as well show some hot chicks boobs while their at it. If you're looking for a solid action/horror movie you aren't going to find it in this movie.

If you think that it's stupid, and a horrible idea, that's one of the best parts, IT'S FUNNY FOR THAT VERY REASON. Also, if you think that it's predictable, when I heard that it's 1 hour and 45 minutes, I was shocked, and was surprised that every single one of those minutes was worth my time...

Jackson, the only person left who can destroy Chuck Norris, sheds a tear.That alone was enough to shatter my faith in happiness, and assure me that there is NOTHING left to believe in.I would give this film 4 stars, if I didn't think that by doing so, I would instill devious jealousy in every other star in existence, therefore, I give this movie a rating of Every-Star-In-Creation.This movie is better than my first kiss.More thrilling than my first time behind the wheel.And infinitely more frightening.This film is better than the day anybody reading this lost, or will lose their virginity.This film is better than the wedding day you had, or will have.And is far more flawless than your unborn children.Fun fact?

Movie, maybe he thought that with all these ridiculous snake-attacks (yes, the movie is about snakes on a plane, I hope I didn't reveal anything here which is not given by the title already) ,which reminded me on the vampires in ""From dusk till dawn"", it might have the same effect: Being so exaggerated it already becomes funny again.

When everyone in the crowd applouds and claps, and there are standing ovations, its hard not to enjoy the movie.That is what made the movie good. What made the movie bad, is that I went to see the movie again, this time with just one person, and there was just not the same entusiasm. I didn't have nearly the fun we had the first time. It was an OK movie the second time around, with Samuel L. Jackson making up films shortcomings.This movie is best taken with 6 or more beers, and 5 or more friends. When you have gotten both of those together, GO SEE THIS MOVIE! You will love it! I will buy this movie when it comes out on DVD for the same reasons i own BEERFEST.

Anyway, about 15 minutes before the end I was going to give that movie a rating around 7 but the way it ended, like a trivial Hollywood production, with our heroes exchanging invitations to dinner, phone numbers and kisses, and acting like 3/4 of the passengers of an entire plane haven't brutally died less than an hour ago, diminished the rate a little bit. An unusual turn of events, nice snake effects but too pink and unrealistic end. Also, there are surely many other far more effective means to bring a plane down than releasing drugged snakes on it.

This is neither.Anyone living in a snake zone, such as here in Africa, will find this movie difficult to enjoy given the choice of snakes and their unreality. Why put a python (with exaggerated teeth) on-board? The thing is hugely heavy, slow, takes up lots of space and can kill only one small, sleeping person. I could walk ahead from a big one. Also, why the variety? The aim was to bring down the plane. This would dictate filling the plane with black mambas, the most deadly snake in the world. They grow 14 feet in length, and can travel at 12 mph & should easily catch any human in a crowded plane. The mamba is also highly nervous & feeling threatened on a crowded plane they would be very likely to attack fiercely (no need for the other unbelievable item, the pheromones).I guess their omission was due to the innocuous looks of this very slender snake  an anaemic grey.Then, though the above removed any feeling of threat, the lame dialogue and shallow characterizations drove me to seek the fast-forward button all too often.So when I saw the high IMDb rating I was floored and had to submit my first comment.To bad, this concept could have been a really good thriller.",Snakes on a Plane

But then I realized I could just watch the three stooges for free and laugh more! Whatever respect I might have had for Samuel Jackson has been irreversibly destroyed. And Hollywood demonstrates once again how removed from reality they really are. When I was a kid we used to catch snakes for fun. The only thing snakes would do is huddle at the bottom of the cargo bay. And no amount of Hollywood cartoon snakes can change that.This movie isn't worth a trip to Blockbuster.

I have been struggling to find something to compare it to, but I just can't think of anything that matches this, maybe starship troopers 2. Witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my DVD player, but compared to this its effects are great. The acting superb and the script should be awarded.

The snake providers in this film and the artists that imaged them are excellent and I hope they were paid well. But the movie's story line is shallow and adolescent. The technical consulting was dismal, as there wasn't the slightest effort to use correct aviation terminology or make anything about the flight believable. The two of us looked at each other several times grinning at it's cheesiness... Yea, there is a certain fun in ""cheeze"" but it guarantees the film won't be taking up space on store shelves very long. If you want to see blood and guts, go rent the gory dollar specials at the video store. If you like to watch macho tough guys in action there's always WWF wrestling. (and it's free on TV) Also, it's far too full of contemporary pop-culture ""hollywood"" cliché. I predicted several events before they happened. It was all too familiar, seen it before, getting old. For example, white males portrayed as rude, ignorant, semi-drunken, womanizers, (portrayal of the pilot was beyond awful) then cocky young black guy, barely old enough to shave regular, jumps in and saves the day landing a crippled 600,000 pound airliner...

Well I can't think of much more to say other than crap script, crap storyline, crap plot, crap theme, crap set, Desperate acting, terrible - hopefully deliberate, stereotyping, bad special effects. I just hope it was supposed to be that funny. I also hope that Samuel L Jackson - an otherwise respectable and entertaining feller was just doing it for the laugh - either that or he was temporarily insane.The only redeeming feature this movie has is the fact that it CAN be laughed at.

If it was about snakes, shouldn't they have gotten a snake expert or at least someone who has ever seen National Geographic? I thought that snakes saw using heat, but apparently they just have night vision? another question: why would Kim put hundreds of rare snakes on a plane with a bomb to release them when he is trying to kill the witness? wouldn't it make more sense to just blow up the plane?

There are hundreds of suspense-horror flicks that are better watching, and that do a better job: Halloween, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Alien, etc. etc. The snake attacks are predictable and boring and Samuel L. Jackson is simply doing self-parody instead of acting. The whole passenger manifest is made up of offensive stereotypes, or inoffensive ones, and the only suspense involved is in which snake is going to get which predictable victim. The film is not even committed to its campy elements, like the pseudo-gay male flight attendant or the leis (rimes with lays) laced with pheromones. And what is the FBI doing flying a witness back to LA to testify in a murder trial, when the victim was killed in Hawaii and the killers remain there?

The theater was packed and everyone was having a great time. Once it got started 2 minutes didn't elapse without the whole audience cringing, laughing or both over and over. It received a standing ovation at the end and EVERYONE who left had a smile on their face and was bouncing around talking about how great it was.

The dialog was atrocious and the pacing was terrible. Snakes on a Plane is possibly the worst case of horrible script writing I have seen in the last year. Much of the acting was bad, with some of it being acceptable and Samuel Jackson's being sub-par. The whole thing was underdeveloped and you can tell it is just a piece of junk hashed together to score on the unexpected pop culture sensation that the mere concept of the title became. You can imagine the actors and film makers joking about the absurdity of the movie they were making and priding themselves in the fact that they are okay with making a tasteless cheesy movie in the name of fun and entertainment. Well I think it failed at being entertaining. For one thing the film sort of tried for the philosophy that something can be 'so bad its good' but at the same time they made a big enough effort to contradict that. In some places it tried to be overtly silly, but at other times you can see how an actual attempt to be taken seriously is made. With some amount of experience at the helm, a Hollywood budget, and a big name star full of enthusiasm the movie can't help but be somewhat passable, or at least relatively polished. It results in being just good enough that you can't enjoy its awfulness, but not nearly good enough to enjoy or appreciate it on its own merit in any way. It doesn't commit to being a bad film, and becomes an even worse one on account. All the supporters would tell me ""movies are ENTERTAINMENT... you don't know how to have fun, you take them too seriously and forgot what the movies are about!!!"".

Its main redeeming factor (besides the overall experience, which I will soon talk about) was Samuel L. Jackson's performance. There was nothing special about it, but every time he gives a bad ass lecture, the power of his personality blows me away. The surprise snake attacks were funny, too. Overall, on its own merit, the movie was nothing more than entertaining.Now, as for the overall movie-going experience, only one ""word"" can describe it: FAN-F#CKING-TABULOUS!!!

Of course, my group of approximately 20-25 people was among the loudest. As we walked in the theater, people were cheering, the walls were shaking. The feeling was comparable to a basketball game in Haas Pavilion. My group took up a couple rows near the front so as to keep the energy going. My friend lead a ""SoaP"" spell-out in which the whole theater joined. We started a wave that went front-to-back twice. The hissing was constant. We all were chanting ""Muthafuckin' snakes on a muthafuckin' plane! Muthafuckin' snakes on a muthafuckin' plane!"" The crowd went wild as the lights dimmed. Previews seemed to last forever, the feeling emphasized by the whole theater yelling for ""fast-forwards"" and booing about their lack of snakes. The movie started and our shouts for joy were uncontainable. Every bad ass Sam Jackson quote, every surprise attack, every lame attempt at a serious line was followed by thunderous applause and cheers. The energy lasted throughout the whole movie. Not since the Cal-USC game last spring had I been involved with such an excited crowd. The credits rolled as the theater chanted, ""Sequel! Sequel!""

It wasn't until I went to my favorite movie database website, IMDb.com, and saw the unexpected user rating of 8! -- 8 out of a possible 10 (1400 votes at that point)-- that I decided to give it a chance.The scares were gratuitous, especially the sudden loud noises that make you jump... for nothing.Are all scripts written by adolescent boys? Or for them? This one aimed at their without-a-clue sexual fantasies, and at their worst nightmares about their body parts in peril. The snakes were good. The movie was not.My faith in IMDb's rating system has been shaken.",Snakes on a Plane
892,CraZguyME,Snakes deliver.,9,18 August 2006,"Often times the title of a movie is a deceitful attempt on the part of Hollywood to capture a larger market audience. In my opinion, most of the charm of Snakes on a Plane is derived from the fact that it delivers exactly what its title proposes- no more, no less.The plot of the movie is remarkably thin, very obviously rushed. It's really just a simple set-up to give you exactly what you want: Samuel L. Jackson dealing righteous beatings to snakes on a plane. Do not see this movie if you want to put your brain to use. Do not see this movie if you are expecting anything more than snakes on a plane. DO see this movie if you'd like to see an 1 hour and 45 minutes of snake-whooping.This film, though very simple, was in my opinion one of the most satisfying I've seen all year.",Snakes on a Plane

The people of various internet communities took the cause up, based only on it's title and it's main star - Samuel L. Jackson.Many people decided to sell unofficial merchandise almost a year before the film would be at the cinema, OTC was that hyped.The question is - Did it live up to the hype? YES! what an awesome movie!This decade needed a good old-fashioned b-movie like this - and SoaP delivered a highly entertaining movie from start to finish. A good balance of dark humour, thrills and horror combined with solid acting from the cast.Overall 10/10 Best movie of the year so far!",Snakes on a Plane

It delivers all the action, humor, and greatness anyone could want. Samuel L. Jackson plays his character perfectly, and no one could ever hope to play it as well as he did. Great scenes start coming early in the movie and don't stop. The snakes are insane.

896,nitro5551,"A Hilarious, Ridiculous Masterpiece... Watch, Relax, and Enjoy",10,18 August 2006,"Snakes On A Plane is brilliant. It takes an internationally famed over-the-top actor, Samuel L. Jackson, and throws him into easily the most ridiculous movie of 2006. SOAP is made in a way that completely catches the viewer in a web of R-rated gore and humor that is impossible to resist. Go into the theater with your mindset being to have a good time and you will laugh your a** off. At the preview showing which I caught, the audience was having a very fun experience as they watched one of the most absurd events in cinema. Although the CGI's were bad, the plot line was lacking, and the dialogue was simply thrown together, this was all done intentionally. It made the movie a great experience. Also, the watcher's expectation for the single most anticipated line in the film ""I'm sick and tired of these mother f***ing snakes on this mother f***ing plane"" was as well delivered as William Shatner's ""Khan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" (from ""Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan). Overall see it and have a great time, because this is a comedy for everyone to enjoy.",Snakes on a Plane

The story is simple as can be and the ""horror"" is exactly what can be expected when you read the title of the movie. Actually all the ""horror"" you see is more like comedy. Totally exaggerated. You will see what I mean by that if you go see the movie even though I wouldn't recommend it. No real surprises. Not very original. I thought I would go see it because the rating was pretty good on here. I saw it on DVD, I wouldn't have gone to the theater for it. It's not worth it.

The acting is superb, the effects are to die for, and you'll flip for that Snake-CAM. I did.

Jackson is at his wise-cracking best and the sheer audience participation aspect is great. Many of us were applauding and adding our own dialogue amongst ourselves. Best of all, my sceptical mate enjoyed it a great deal. It was brilliant to be part of such a phenomenon and the producers must have known they were onto a winner when the film garnered such fan reaction when it was first announced. How many films have a fan-base before they are even out?

First of all I have seen some of the recent horror films of the new year, Pulse, that video-game forgettable one and oh, The Decent. But this one is the only one that truly stood out to me as having the potential to becoming either a midnight cinema classic or a DVD-wonder. If I need to explain the plot, it would pretty much solidify, you might not have read the title. The part you would not know is that the reason for the snakes on a plain, involves a witness in protective custody. And in order to avoid giving away too much, there is the movie. What makes this film well worth the 9 rating I gave it, are the B-grad movie performances that were meant to be exactly what they were. Anyone who saw the Julianna (pardon the spelling) Margulies interview knows that she said the movie was intentionally supposed to be silly, weird and at times scary. That is exactly what the film did. Some of the funniest parts of the movie are the ""trouser friendly kiss"" jiving to a man who is obsessed with his trouser snake, and he gets bite right on it. I think every man in the audience squirmed a bit at that scene. Now, if you are looking for a movie with great one-liners, and snakes that bite people in every which way imaginable, (I am not kidding here), and with some character development, (yes) character development that actually is believable then go see this film. There are two many movies that have been huge box-office hits that are terrible movies.

I drove 60 miles to see this movie with my friend opening night and I got the BEST theater experience of my LIFE. Sure, I have seen better films in my days (Road to Perdition, Empire of the Sun, Close Encounters, the list goes on) but that is not what this film is. It is inferior to those films in basically every cinematic way, but that's not what Snakes on a Plane is aiming for. It's aiming for something new, and it's YOUR responsibility to give that new thing a fair reception. This movie is a new kind of cinema. It's stupid cinema telling you it's stupid. It's telling you what it is, giving you the OPTION of coming in or staying out. But it gives you the unique opportunity that, if you decide to go in, to LAUGH, be SCARED, have GREAT audience interaction, and all around will give you MEMORABLE theatrical experience. IF you let it! It is my opinion, and the opinion of the people I went with to see the movie at the 10pm showing the night of the 17th, that this movie is a crappy movie but an UNRIVALED theater experience. Since the reception of this movie is highly dependent upon certain factors, I will offer a good guide to enjoying this movie the way it was MEANT to be enjoyed.Realize the movie is not a movie, but a gathering. It is an event. An event where you bring your friends and your humor, and leave behind your ambitions to be negative. All that Snakes on a Plane wants to do is to brighten up your day. Also, have a few drinks before hand. Get yourself in the frame of mind if you were to go to the Rocky Horror Picture Show, as that is the proper comparison for this work. It is this generation's Rocky Horror Picture Show! And finally, please yell your butt off during the screening. Get your crowd riled up! Snakes on a Plane has let its guards down by telling you it's Snakes on a Plane, I suggest you let YOUR guards down and try to ENJOY it the way it was mean to be enjoyed! :)",Snakes on a Plane

It starts out really simple, and slightly cheese as to be expected and then carries it throughout the movie. I don't think I've been as freaked out by a movie since I've seen spiceworld in theaters (against my will).Seriously, if your looking for a fun movie thats well put together and easy to fall instead of shaking images on the screen supposedly meaning artistic views of the government falling or some other obscure idea, then this is your movie.

907,The_Farwall-1,Don't believe the hype,1,22 August 2006,"The huge hype around this film originated when all that was known about it was the title and the involvement of Samuel L Jackson, and the hype grew because of the exact same reason the movie originated in the first place, because ""Snakes on a Plane"" is an appallingly bad idea for a movie. All the internet spoofs and bloggers knew this and the blogger support was surely informed with a hefty dose of irony. We wanted to see this film because it sound hilariously awful.Sadly, the film makers don't seem to have got the irony, they thought people genuinely wanted to see an 'action-triller' about a plane full of killer snakes and played the whole thing straight and serious. A decent budget, probably boosted by the massive fan interest, takes away any possibility of ""so bad it's good"" on the production side and we're just left with a dull script being walked through by bored actors.",Snakes on a Plane
908,lindseybowers,It does what it says on the tin!,7,24 October 2006,"This a review I wrote for Snakes on a Plane.There is no denying the clever marketing of cinema giant New Line's freshest offer, Snakes on a Plane. With spectacular support from online fans, as well as iconic actor Samuel L Jackson taking the lead role, the film could also accredit it's quickly- achieved status as a cult classic to its laugh-out-loud name, which is memorable for its no- nonsense simplicity. And according to critics, Snakes does indeed do what it says on the tin. The movie is about an air plane journey. An air plane journey with lots of snakes. And people die. Horribly. You may be forgiven for thinking that this predictable plot recipe along with Jackson's familiar portrayal of 'bad cop turned good cop' hero is destined to be labelled as yet another cheap-thrill Hollywood flop, like Anaconda.Yet director David R Ellis and his team ensured the film reached immense popularity before it was even released to cinema audiences. This was done by reaching out to a target group on the internet to find out what audiences are looking for on their cinema screens. And, according to this particular audience, who were able to have an input in the film's creative process through online voting, the best way forward for New Line was to include more swearing, more bare, busty blondness, and especially more gore. Do the preferences of thousands of internet geeks reflect those of the millions of cinema- goers that New Line were hoping to deliver to? Maybe not. ""We're a little disappointed"" says distribution boss for the company, David Tuckerman. ""There were inflated expectations on this picture, with the internet buzz."" Tuckerman's disenchanted words follow the film's underachievement in the box office, making 15 million in the US in the first week, and just 1 million in the UK. This indicates harder to please target audiences outside of the World Wide Web, where hyped-up crazes and fads are often born, only to become a distant memory a few weeks later. Perhaps a full length feature revolving around airline passengers dying horrendously via spitting poisonous reptiles appeals to a smaller niche than expected? Away from over- zealous internet fans and snobby critics I find there is a mixed reaction; ""Oh God, no, that looks so tragic,"" says Matt, 23, when I mention the film to him. Yet, Pete, another male of a similar age proclaims ""It's the Citizen Kane of our time!"" His playful tone implies that he is of course joking, but the glint in his eye tells me that he can't wait to get his hands on the DVD (especially so he can rewind to the bit where the blonde's bare breast is bitten by a viper over and over again.) Those who appreciate Snakes.., like Pete, perhaps hold the ability to detach themselves from reality a little more than others. They know that snakes don't really slither through human eye sockets, and they especially don't buy the bit where Jackson kills a couple of the critters with a broken wine bottle on the end of a stick (after all, which airline in their right mind would allow glass onto their craft?) Fans of the picture like it because its absurdity makes them laugh.So perhaps the downfall of Snakes is that it's taken too seriously. A film that has been so hyped, so talked about will be expected to be good cinema. However, what we get is a mediocre script, highly cartoonised characters and the slight feeling that Samuel L Jackson is having us all on. Yet this is what makes it such a great film to go and see. Who cares what the reviews say? With such a loyal pack of online followers and a great sense of fun, Snakes on a Plane won't crash without a fight. And the greatest amusement of all is thinking of what could possibly come next from New Line. Bears in a Submarine anyone?",Snakes on a Plane
909,saiyanlova617,"There are snakes on a plane, and that's all you need to know",8,18 August 2006,"I, like my friend Sgt. Fluffy, went into Snakes on a Plane knowing exactly what I was going to get: a lot of snakes on an airplane. I went with friends to see the 10pm Thursday showing, and did so purposely. For a movie like this, with cheesy B dialogue and obligatory violence, gore, swearing, and reptiles, you want to see it with a large group. Well I sat in a theater full of people who were chanting ""SNAKES"" ""ON A PLANE!"" a good 10 minutes before the previews began. And during the previews all hell broke loose, each preview was greeted with a healthy ""These aren't snakes!"" ""Where are the snakes?!"" The entire audience was hissing and yelling and just having a good time.Then the movie started. Samuel L Jackson's name got a cheer, as did the title. The only other credit that got a cheer was Kenan Thompson, probably because the audience watched Good Burger, All That, and The Kenan and Kel show, and knew that this movie was as big as poor Kenan was ever going to get. I was a little nervous after hearing the opening dialogue, as it cheesy to the point of unbearable, particularly coming from the ""bad guy"" Eddie Kim. But have no fear; it doesn't take long before Samuel L Jackson appears on the screen (and his appearance got the second biggest cheer of the night, so much so that it was impossible to hear what he was saying.) And Mr. Jackson is more than perfect for this role: he talks like a bad cop, he drives like a super FBI agent, he shoots his gun as if it were just another one of his fingers.Of course the movie doesn't really get good til they are on the plane. The movie purposely sets up by showing all the characters that will be killed/will be killing snakes later. It's a fun little guessing game to see who will be doing what. Then the snakes are released, in a manner that seemed made for the fans: SPOILER the snakes are in a container with a timer on it. So when the numbers eventually hit 00:03 the whole audience is going ""3...2...1""! And off we go.So now I suppose I could tell you a little more about the movie's non snake plot and its characters. Or I could tell you that there are a TON of snakes...that bite and are poisonous. They kill people in creative albeit disgusting ways. And the snakes are killed in great fashion. And honestly that's all you need to know. The movie is suspenseful, disgusting, and a little scary, with good special effects, fun characters and cheesy dialogue. Go see it with a good, geeky crowd, and enjoy the ride.Oh and if you're wondering what got the biggest cheer of the night? Sam's now famous internet inspired line. People stood up, people cheered, people clapped and said it with him. Of course I didn't realize that the line is the beginning to a little speech Sam gives, so I didn't hear anything he said after ""I've had it with these...!"" But does it matter? Not in the slightest. Especially since, the odds are, I'll be seeing it once more.",Snakes on a Plane
910,Mr_Barno,"""Snakes On A Plane""?",10,21 August 2006,"I was sceptical about the film's quality before its release, considering the amount of hype generated was supporting the film's appeal more than the film itself.However, after leaving the cinema screen after the movie, amongst a crowd over very pleased viewers, I realised ""Snakes On A Plane"" was in a league of its own. Samuel L. Jackson is beautifully suited to his FBI agent character Agent Flynn, and overall the cast fits the film well, and this will not disappoint any fans involved in the hype that preceded the film's release. The snakes behave with great volatility, causing several moments of horror, but this is often combined with hilarious comedy one-liners and actions. In fact, besides the 'action' genre this film may be lazily classed into, it could easily fit into 'adventure', 'horror', 'suspense', 'comedy' and perhaps most importantly 'thriller' - and what a thriller.Without spoiling the plot, there are reasons why there are vicious attacking snakes on the plane, reasons which are able to justify the film's awesome title. ""Snakes On A Plane"" gives you exactly what it says it will. Critics will never like a film like this, because it's not arty or based on a true story of love and despair. And ""Snakes On A Plane"" isn't trying to be that; and everyone involved in the film, the production and the hype will know it isn't likely to run for an Oscar, but the fact it has got such a phenomenal fan base means it has done something right. Amongst the complex, twisted and sometimes downright confusing story lines of modern Hollywood, ""Snakes On A Plane"" stands out as simple but awesomely original.The film is one hell of an experience; there are no dull moments, no moments where something isn't happening that you want to watch. It completely lives up to the hype, and is the film everyone wanted it to be, because the producers listened to the fans' opinions, and made it an epic. When the action on the plane starts, it starts hardcore. Within the ""Snakes On A Plane"" framework, they have mastered every possible inch of a thrill and every single atom of action available. Then they have added precious comedy elements and magnificent one-liners, including a few from Samuel L. himself, which are truly fantastic, bringing the cinema audience I was in to a round of applause and cheers.All in all, if you can understand that the movie is ""Snakes On A Plane"", then you will watch one of the most memorable films you ever will see.

I had actually even planned on not seeing it, but after reading some positive reviews from non-brain-dead sources, I decided it was worth a try. Me and about 10 of my closest friends came to the theater to see it. In the beginning, this film seemed a little slow... but throughout the movie there are ridiculous bits of camp that you might miss if you don't get in the right mindset. This movie, from the beginning, is clearly not meant to be taken seriously(as if there were any doubt before.) As the movie progresses, it gets funnier and funnier--the characters are mostly just shallow stereotypes, but that's how it NEEDED to be. From an overly haughty Englishman to Kenan Thompson's goofy bodyguard character, the characters in Snakes on a Plane are meant to be funny without being too involving, making their lives easier to throw away. And Samuel. Ohhh, Samuel. You can tell how little he takes this movie seriously, and that is for the much, MUCH better. Possibly one of my favorite scenes in the movie came when Jackson takes a harpoon gun and spears a snake to a wall. No explanation is given for the dangerous weapon's appearance, nor is his incredible aim with it, but that's what makes the scene so hilarious. From the slow beginning to the jaw-droppingly awesome climax, this is a camp classic-to-be in every sense of the word. Bring a group of friends and see it.

But see it in the first 2 weeks of release (the sooner the better), and it can be one of the greatest movies ever.I did NOT buy into the hype before the movie. I was dragged into it, kicking and screaming. As a movie, it's mediocre at best, and I woulda asked for my money back if I had rented it from the local Blockbuster at $5.I say mediocre at best, but it is the one movie I WOULD NOT HAVE WANTED TO MISS THE ENTIRE YEAR. Allow me to explain: The audience is EVERYTHING. At the beginning, I heard a lot of laughter and a lot of 'HISSSS'(sound of a snake) and I was beginning to think that this was goina be an audience full of immature loud-mouthed punks. But it grows on you. And you can't help but laugh. After a while, even when people hiss at the 'sad' moments in the movie, EVERYONE LAUGHS, and a good time is had by all. When Sam says the well-known line 'MF snakes on the MF plane', even I was cheering.I mean it. The audience makes this movie great. You will have a rockin' time as long as you're not stuck with tight-ass emo freaks. After the movie was over, EVERYONE in the theatre was talking to everyone else. Strangers sitting above, below, to the left and right... everyone walked in strangers, and left as friends. I've never experienced anything like this in my life. I'm not saying that every audience will be like the one I saw it with. But if you're thinking of seeing it, don't wait. The novelty will die, the hard-core fans will go early, and the experience will slowly die after time.",Snakes on a Plane
918,Zwinger,"Snakes on a Plane: A+++, would do business with again!",6,18 August 2006,"""Snakes on a Plane"" is a daring epic about loyalty. It tests the durability and character of each hero in the movie  and there are heroes aplenty. The phrase ""do what I say and you'll live"" serves as a catalyst throughout the movie, taking on both its manifest and latent meanings with a touching ending that takes a different spin on the credo. As for the plot, some stuff that nobody really cares about happens and then a bunch of people end up on a plane that, in an unforeseen plot twist, becomes overtaken by snakes. From sacrificing lives to save babies in danger and building a barricade out of suitcases to surrendering to the overwhelming passion of love in a mid-air bathroom, ""Snakes on a Plane"" captures human emotion and depicts it perfectly on the big screen. Viewers can relate to the real-life situations where characters are driven by the primal instinct of survival. The Internet proved to be a primary marketing ally for ""Snakes on a Plane,"" creating hype months before the movie came out. With genius coded messages to its audience, screenplay writers John Heffernan and Sabastian Gutierrez pay homage to those who helped make ""Snakes on a Plane"" a cult classic before it was even released. In one scene, a male flight attendant tossed a snake into a microwave and set the timer to 2:10, which would get the snake half-baked on the way to a destination cooking time of 4:20. This symbolism is an appreciative ""thank you"" to one of the many audiences that can appreciate the intricately-wound film. The film also touches upon racial stereotypes, featuring a black solo artist in the music industry who constantly uses hand sanitizer. This metaphor shows how difficult it can be to keep one's hands clean when being a minority in the music business, even when the person cares enough to sign an autograph for a child and a female fan's clothed breast. ""Snakes on a Plane"" will easily be the summer's biggest unexpected hit and Samuel L. Jackson's ""hiss""-terical one-liners will prove to be the most quoted lines on campuses across America once this DVD hits stores.",Snakes on a Plane

It doesn't, for one second, aim for pretension or something more than what it is. It is a movie, simply enough, about motherf****n' snakes on a motherf****n' plane! And what snakes they are. A mixture of CGI and live action, these beauties deliver bite after gruesome, enjoyable bite. The fervor at which the filmmakers attacked (no pun intended) the project is astounding given its B-level roots; if every filmmaker had this kind of energy and drive for their project the cineplex would be a much better place.Samuel L. is perfect in this film. He parodies and feeds off of his previous bada** roles (offering up a nice homage to Jurassic Park in the process). From the minute he shows up on screen we know a true Royal with Cheese-fest is going to ensue.

This time I had not much choice but go and pick this movie (the other choices were a romantic comedy and some teenage action hero movie). Looking back, I would go to the comedy instead. ""Snake on a plane"" has the same wrong paced effects like in ""Deep Blue Sea"" (get real people, sharks and snakes are not ninjas, they don't move so fast, you may want to check out ""Discovery Channel"" from time to time), a childish scenario (how stupid can a mobster be to gather a zillion of snakes, to put them on a plane, to hope they will create chaos on board and the plane will crash, all of this to make sure one specific passenger will die?!).

921,cassellfor3,Amazing movie - exceeded expectations by far,10,18 August 2006,"Snakes on a Plane (or SoaP), is one hell of a movie. It is a breath of fresh air in the movie industry because it does not claim to be more than it is. The best parts of the movie are not all in the trailer (mainly because they were too inappropriate for TV), unlike so many other movies today. If you want to see Samuel L. Jackson fight snakes, on a plane, then SoaP is the movie for you. If you are a film elitist and can't understand why anyone would go see this movie, then don't even bother.I had high expectations going to see this movie tonight, and I am usually worried about getting my hopes up knowing that most movies suck these days (or look to be more than what they really are). However, SoaP exceeded my expectations by a mile. I figured it would be mildly funny, but poorly made. I was wrong - this movie is absolutely hilarious and very gruesome (both things I like in a movie), and it is very well made. Good pacing, good enough acting, and it has Sam Jackson.

I thought it would be borderline serious, but after seeing the trailers on TV, I can honestly tell you that was false.I also didn't see how it would be possible to conduct a movie involving Snakes on a Plane for so long.... but clearly it worked. The Plane became the largest setting necessary, and served as a perfect location for the movie.It is simply amazing. I can't really express it, all I can say is go see it.

Even though you know there are snakes on this plane I still found myself startles when they attacked. Some of the special effects were a little cheezy but all were very effective.

925,CraigBMCM,Planes. Snakes thereof.,10,20 August 2006,"You won't see many phrases like ""I didn't know what to expect"" in reviews of this film. Everyone knew what was coming, right down to the already legendary ""I've had it with these mother******* snakes on this mother******* plane!"" line quite obviously inserted crudely (sic) into a particularly inspiring scene.But the film basically delivers everything it promises; namely a clichéd action film with lots of gruesome snake-related death and mayhem. Snakes get microwaved, chopped, explosively decompressed, stamped on and shot, whilst those of the homo sapiens persuasion are randomly asphyxiated, wrapped up, bitten and genitally mutilated.Like most disaster flicks, the audience is left to guess which characters will live and which will die. There's a token English guy, some spoilt rich people, some all-American heroes, some not-so-subtle product placement and the odd plot crater. A possible shortcoming is that Nathan Phillips' character is underused and his acts of heroism infrequent and unmemorable, with Mr L. J the overwhelming presence in their scenes together.However, none of that matters. I don't know whether it was simply a matter of a year of hype reaching its crescendo, or whether it was a genuine thrill-ride, but I couldn't have enjoyed it more. It felt like the audience was on the brink of applause during many moments, but of course we're reserved English people and we don't do that sort of thing.",Snakes on a Plane

927,muppetheadt,"Delivers, and then some! A Masterpiece of modern cinema...",7,21 August 2006,"The immense hype surrounding this film was by no means flattering to the end result - it delivers on all counts, and then some. Best seen in a packed theatre, because believe me, certain scenes WILL compel a large audience into impromptu applause! And don't be fooled by the genre given above - while this is indeed action, horror and thriller, it's fundamentally a comedy, with the occasional dollop of dark humour.What amazed me about this film was how it tried to be serious at regular intervals, all the while building up for the next joke, completely bringing down the tone time and again. There are times when you can't help but snap back to the pseudo-reality of the circumstances of the film, and there are some moments when I was genuinely concerned about the characters' well being, it's somewhere in the middle, the ""low point"" of the movie. Then suddenly all is forgotten, the focus shifts back to uproarious comedy, and the audience is suitably entertained. Clever film-making indeed.It is better than your average semi-spoof movie, without question - the jokes are funnier, the plot has more substance (though it isn't exactly ""substantial""), and the climax is just so unexpectedly awesome (notwithstanding the ridiculous storyline at that stage of the movie!) - really it is just a quality piece of work. I went into the theatre last night with such reasonably high hopes for a funny but awful film, but what I found was a fully entertaining and hilarious movie that completely delivered, and then some! In the end of the day, I fail to see how anyone could be disappointed by a film with so ridiculous a premise and concept as this has - but I know of no better film for a night in with friends.P.S: Samuel L. Jackson rocks. The most memorable performance he's had since Pulp Fiction!",Snakes on a Plane
928,dik_head1,Just simply not that good,5,22 August 2006,"Rather than helping the film, I think the hype surrounding this movie could be quite harmful. The box office for the opening weekend is in and New Line executives have admitted to their disappointment. It seems as though most of the internet geeks are going to love the film no matter what.Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the film, I just can't say I liked it. When I requested a ticket to 'Snakes on a Plane' at the box office, I wasn't expecting to watch 'Million Dollar Baby', I was aware of what to expect. I just wanted a fun, 90 minute, B-movie slice of summer fun with Sam Motherfucking Jackson beating off some snakes.But I have to agree with what others have been saying, it does feel like the filmmakers just went out to make a bad movie. The 'B' in 'B-movie' does not stand for 'bad'. But the filmmakers seem to think it does. Sam Jackson doesn't have that much screen time, he just walks on screen, talks to somebody for about a minute, then walks off, five minutes later, he reappears and does the same thing. I think he was a bit wasted in this, it's not that I'm against him being in this kind of film, it's just he didn't have a lot to do.Nothing really happened in the film, I wasn't wanting intricate plotting, the plot is in the title, but it just got really repetitive. Just people sitting around enjoying getting bitten by snakes.Nearly every element of the film is bad. And yes you can get some enjoyment out of the film, I did moderately but why settle for mediocre summer fun. If you're in the mood for mindless, summer blockbuster entertainment, there are way better alternatives out there. B-movies don't have to be mediocre(e.g. John Carpenter's career) Liking a film because it's bad just seems silly to me.",Snakes on a Plane

I went into the cinema with low expectations, and thought the movie was great, so don't have your standards set high, and you might like the movie.

The whole time I was waiting for that line, you know which one. I had to use the bathroom incredibly badly, but I of course waited until I heard SamueL belt out his signature phrase. Amusingly enough, also, one of the previews before the movie was for Black Snake Moan, with him saying something or other about eating snakes right before SOAP started.

And of course when Jackson's famous line was spoken, there was more applause in the audience than there was in any Superbowl that has ever taken place.Then, after the movie ended, all you could hear was people raving to each other about how blindingly amazing it was.

It's called ""suspension of disbelief"" in order to have a great time and an exciting ride. Not to mention, I found myself cracking up with laughter on more than one occasion. My theater exploded with laughter and applause when Sam said his now famous line (can you say AFI's 100 best quote list?) ""Enough is enough..."". Do I even have to say the rest? It was fantastic. Samuel L. gave an awesome performance as well. It was as if he wasn't even acting. Our theater also exploded the first time we heard Sam's voice, spouting out another classic line of dialog.

This is not a movie to dissect and find flaws in- it's a movie to laugh it for the sheer insanity of it! I mean, this movie has the same flavor as a Douglas Adams novel. The concepts he applied to the hilarity of many were science and logic pushed to a maddening degree, then pushed into nonsense! The writer of this campy film took the action drama, and threw it up into a level worthy of ridicule- which makes this as much worth watching as Pan's Labyrinth. While PL is good for thought-provoking and its absolute beauty, this movie is good for those who don't want to try to keep up. It feeds you everything you actually to keep up (like the idea of a snake expert being tracked down to deal with a snake problem- duh!), and then gives you what you really WANT (random explosions and little screeches as various people and CGI snakes got mutilated.I mean, it's a terrible movie, with so many flaws that it's almost sickening, but it's those flaws that actually make it a really good movie.

I've been eagerly waiting for Snakes on a Plane, but I wasn't going to expect much from it. Some great laughs, a cheesy plot, and enough one-liner quotes to keep me occupied for a few weeks.I was not disappointed and, in fact, my expectations were exceeded.A surfer in Hawaii witnesses a brutal murder by a notorious Asian gangster from L.A. who's testimony will be used against said gangster. The surfer's guardian is none other than Samuel L. Jackson. They need to get him back to California where he'll testify and finally put the gangster behind bars. Well, the enemy won't go down so easily and he places a time-release crate of pheromone-frenzied snakes onto this plane. And so, we begin our descent into the slithering, scaly chaos that is Snakes on a Plane.Despite the absurdity of the premise, the film was rather enjoyable. Perhaps it was because I was seeing it at midnight with fifty other people, all of whom were just as excited as I was about this movie. When Mr. Jackson first appears on screen, everyone cheered. When he delivers his, ""Motherf***ing snakes on a motherf***ing plane!"" line, the crowd cheered. With every gruesome-yet-hilarious death, the crowd cheered (or sometimes cringed ^_^).Snakes On A Plane isn't just a movie. If you were to take it at face value, you'll be disappointed. What must be understood about it is that SoaP is an experience. Never have I heard so much cheering in a movie theatre since Attack of the Clones, when Yoda pulls out his lightsaber.

If you ever find yourself less than thrilled to be watching it, all you have to do is remember the title and suddenly it's amazing! Really the best thing about it (other than the concept/title) is that, on the whole, it's not a terribly made film.

If I can see any flaws, its that the snakes looked incredibly fake (but who cares, low budget), and at times it might of been too serious.

When the movie first starts, its obvious that the writers and director are making a joke about the whole thing. Why else would you see it? Did you really plan on seeing a serious movie about snakes taking over a plane and coming out with something useful? Snakes on a Plane is a Hollywood movie pretending to be low budget and it succeeds amazingly. I bet they thought ""We know this is going to be bad. How bad can we make it?"" and thats the genius behind this movie. Do almost all of the actors really suck at acting or are they acting to act like they can't act? With that irony 'Snakes on a Plane' is an all genre movie; action, comedy, horror, romance, drama and suspense. One thing that surprised me is that i actually wanted to know what would happen next as i got caught up in the suspense. The characters all have strong personalities and Samuel L.

After 25 minutes without snakes, I was questioning my presence at the theater. After 30 more minutes, there was no question. We merely stayed to hear Sammy Jack scream about motherfucking' snakes on a motherfucking' plane (which was a little disappointing). Had the day not been saved by someone who played video games too much, it could have even been salvageable...The most redeeming points in the movie were the snake bites on the nipple, penis and eyeball--and the fat lady being molested.I will definitely watch this again when it premiers on Fox next month.",Snakes on a Plane

I figured that this would be a wonderful romp in the world of advertising and product placement, and it was. However, the movie had much more than that. I dare say, it even had everything an 18-30 year old male looks for in a movie. I don't want to give away any parts of the story (Not that the story itself is that hard to figure out. There are snakes, that happen to be on a plane.), but this movie actually brings out a range of emotions. There are of course parts which make you laugh, yet, it explores such key movie elements as drama, action, and briefly, horror (Okay, and a little bit of Kung Fu.). Sam Jackson did a wonderful job and once more proved that any movie with him in a lead role can not fail. I highly urge any, and all males of the world to go see this movie (But be warned, with all the gore, squeamish be aghast.), it's freakin' genius.",Snakes on a Plane

I cannot recall anything clever, witty, or outstanding about the actual script in any way, but the atmosphere of the theater-goers along side in the packed theater truly made the movie special for me. From pre-show chanting (""I SAY SNAKES, YOU SAY PLANE!!"") to post-show jubilation with all gathering around, the audience is what makes Snakes On A Plane fun. Like so many other cult films before it, quirky but strong performances lend a hand to the joyous mob-mentality of the audience - all cheering when Samuel L. Jackson kicks butt, and going crazy each time the snakes are about to strike.My theater-going experience was fraught with exciting crowd outbursts. The obligatory screams, the giddy response to jokes, the desire made public to see SLJ triumphant, the harrowing anticipation when the snakes are present, and the occasional guilty squeals of pleasure of the crowd all bonded us, the 346 people viewing Snakes On A Plane, in a way wondrously indescribable.It was a cult classic before it even came out, it is now a cult classic theater-going extravaganza, and it probably will remain a cult classic for much time. Therefore it deserves the high 7 I give it.If they're not already, get the audience into it. You'll be glad you did. :)",Snakes on a Plane

The plot, the acting, the 'action' all awful. once it reaches the $3 bin at the supermarket, it'll still be overpriced. if you're looking to waste a couple hours out of your life go dust the furniture instead, it'll be more interesting. With a plot less meaningful than Dr. Seuss's ""hop on pop"" and acting worse than a grade school play, not even the fact Samuel Jackson is in the movie makes it worth seeing. He was in the 3rd Star Wars movie too, that didn't make it good. He's a good actor, but not even Mr. Jackson could save this film. Summary: don't see this movie.

I leave angry, because I didn't get a chance to hear what I wanted to hear, or enjoy seeing what I wanted to see.The bottom line is that this movie did exactly what it set out to do. It was fun for the audience, and everyone got into it. And I didn't care that 15 people were laughing too loud, speaking at the wrong times, or whatever. I didn't miss any important dialog, because we all know that Samuel L. Jackson can't whisper.I laughed my ass off, jumped a couple times, and enjoyed the fact that everyone was having a good time experiencing it together. And that's what I expected out of it. Mission accomplished. I'll echo the sentiments of some critics and agree that this is the ultimate B horror movie.There are some snakes on a plane in this film, so anyone who doesn't like snakes, or planes, should probably stay home.

They bust in with guns and try to kill him but Sam L is there to save his life, ""do as I say and you live"" he says to calm Sean. Sam L then convinces Sean to testify against the crime family in LA.

I love the actors that were chosen to play the characters such as Kenan Thompson as 3 G's bodyguard, Troy, and having David Koechner play Rick, the perverted co-pilot, was great for a part that would need a little comic relief. I also loved the writing. As expected Samuel L. was sweet as all hell, and did not disappoint. There were some kick ass deaths in the movie too. Especially when the girl gets her tit bit. There was not a single part of the movie that I wasn't entertained or interested in what they were going to do next. I also loved the script, and the timing of the things being said. There were many well developed characters. I loved the gay acting flight attendant who actually turned out being straight, 3 G's, both of his bodyguards, and the British guy.

This is the perfect summertime flick to catch for all those popcorn munchers out there. Sam Jackson is in fantastic form as agent Flynn. From his opening lines all the way till the end of the film, the one liners and cool persona kept shining through. Keenan Thompson stole the entire film as he was much funnier here than he is and or was on SNL (Is he still a cast member???) Keep an eye out for Champ Kind as the pilot.

The characters were stereotypes, the dialogue was juvenile, the drama was contrived.Questionif a bad guy has the ability to put poison snakes on a plane, have an automated system for releasing them at a certain time, and use a special method to make them want to attack peoplewhy couldn't he just plant a bomb?

Although I did not leave the theater wanting my time back (as I don't actually pay for movies anymore) I didn't really find any redeeming qualities.There were a few lines and such that made me chuckle, but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger (in mind more than age as this film is rated R) male audience. The fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well. I know you all want to hear Samuel L. say his infamous line, but let's be honest, it's a whole lot of hype for very little pay off. The only truly horrible part of the film was the CG, which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screen.Now I am a reasonable man, I knew going into the theater that I wasn't going to be seeing ""Casablanka,"" and I am at least thankful that this film is an original (albiet inane) idea and not some re-make or franchise spin off. However to be honest, if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months.",Snakes on a Plane
957,kencsnyder,Best Bad Movie Ever,10,17 August 2006,"This movie was no Citizen Kane. But then, Citizen Kane had Orson Welles pining over a sled. It didn't have Sam Jackson and mother lovin' snakes on a mother lovin' plane. The acting was bad (except for my boy, Jules, of course). The writing was cheesy. The CGI was horrible. FOrtunately, the makers of this movie knew it. There is nothing worse than a bad movie that takes itself seriously and thinks it is a good movie. You have to respect a movie that says, ""You know, we're never going to win any Oscars, so let's just have fun."" Then you have the same movie that says, ""We were going to be a PG movie, but then what's the point of having Sam Jackson?"". And finally, a movie that says, ""Oh look! I'm months away from release and I already have a cult following. Since fans are what ultimately drive the film industry, I'm going to give them what they want."" This is a non stop flight of enjoyment. I'd call it a popcorn movie, but every ten second I'd jump so hard that the popcorn would fly out of my hand. Suspension of disbelief is a necessity to enjoy SoaP. But that's the best part. I confess that I am an art-house movie snob, but sometimes you just have to let lose and have fun. I had 105 minutes of non-stop fun. Don't expect a masterpiece. Expect to laugh your tail off and expect to be tempted to make witty comments about the action on screen. Also, see this at a late show, preferably midnight. Make sure that the other people in the theater are loud rowdy kids. Let the fun begin.",Snakes on a Plane
958,agent17,Don't get high on the hype.,6,19 August 2006,"A lot of people on IMDb have given Snakes on a Plane a 10/10 rating and left comments like ""omg this is best movie ever lol."" Unfortunately, most of these people had come to this conclusion before seeing the movie, and are still high on the Internet hype that built the movie up to be something it's not.I guess there's no real point to writing a review of Snakes On A Plane. With a title like that, you've already made up your mind about if you want to see it. But keep this in mind...Snakes On A Plane isn't a comedy movie. It isn't a horribly cheesy or bad (intentionally or not) movie, either, or one that's ""so bad it's good,"" which is a phrase that gets thrown around a lot in SOAP discussions. Also, the movie's not all about Samuel L. Jackson being a badass or swearing a lot, although it happens. Snakes On A Plane is a entertaining mid-grade thriller movie that pretty much delivers what you'd expect from a Hollywood movie about snakes on an airplane. No more, no less.Don't see this movie if you're expecting to constantly laugh at Samuel L. Jackson showing off how cool he is. There are plenty of moments where Sam kicks ass and gives some great one-liners and does amusing things, but he is offscreen just as often as he is on it.Snakes On A Plane isn't the best movie of the year. It's not the funniest movie of the year or the scariest, but it is a good movie if you're looking for mindless fun involving a lot of snakes on an airplane, some gratuitous gore and nudity, and a few great Samuel L. Jackson moments, check it out.",Snakes on a Plane

It was Funny and it almost appears the actors didn't take it or themselves too seriously and just had fun with it. It's not the best movie i've seen, but probably one of the most entertaining movies i've watched in a long time. We had Samuel L. Jackson playing a role that really reminded me of Deep Blue See & Julianna Marguiles who's just plain hot.

960,peter_lynch32,View this movie with a large group of people,9,19 August 2006,"1975 saw an original creation: the cult hit that is good only when screened with large audiences. In the 30 years following the Rocky Horror Picture Show, no movie has come close to offering such one-dimensional appeal. With Snakes on a Plane, RHPC may already be usurped.SoaP may not gross $150 million in the box office because it doesn't have a very wide base of appeal. Actually, it may not make $100 million. It's really made for males 18-30, and I can't imagine my grandparents--or yours, for that matter--spending the senior fee to watch this brilliant piece of crap.This is a movie that could do well to be shown in the theaters every few years due to the atmosphere required to make viewing it enjoyable. I went to a screening in the Boston area, and found the theater packed with rowdy fans who had undoubtedly been caught up in the online hype SoaP had generated. Some people were dressed up as pilots with snakes draped around their necks, others wore SoaP tees, and one huge man in front of me handed out small plastic snakes. When Sammy said his famous line, the crowd joined in and then applauded Sammy.The action was pretty trite and predictable, but luckily, I don't think anybody expected the movie to be very cerebral. I certainly hope not. The dialogue was occasionally witty, mostly cringe-worthy, and, for the most part, secondary to the main point: Sammy J beating up some snakes.The bottom line is this: if you're going to see this movie, see it in the theater. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience and was totally worth the $10 fee.",Snakes on a Plane

Wait what can I say good about the movie........ I liked the....... oh the fly by shot of the beach, makes me want to go to Hawaii. What else.... no that's it. I mean stereotypical roles, taking plot lines from other crappy movies. Wow the pilots die didn't see that coming. An ending when they can cure the people infected oooooh how original. I like how the attendant likes the FBI guy Sam Jackson.... he so sexy. I totally fell in love with my girlfriend after 15 seconds and 14 lines of dialogue between us. Just like in this movie. I know the goal wasn't realism but would it hurt them to try a little? Just a little. This is the new Millennium do they think the movie going public will swallow this garbage? Oh yeah lets kill the guy with snakes on a plane or lets just hire a sniper, or a good old Taliban RPG and toast the plane. And to top it all how could airport security be so weak to let hundreds of poisonous snakes on the plane, look at all the holes in security and pre flight checks. Please don't see this movie don't waste your time, money, oxygen or energy you will truly feel dumber afterwards. I now anxiously await the sequel ""alligators on runaway transit bus"" that has to deliver an organ to a patient that's going to die without it, but the guy had to take the bus due to storm ... blah blah blah and please insert crap Hollywood makes us swallow oh and happy ending where guy who delivers organ falls in love with the bus driver. ps bus driver is blonde model that used to do playboy and does gymnastics on the side.",Snakes on a Plane

I must say the movie starts out with a ridiculous story about some criminal trying to crash a plane with snakes. Then the amount of snakes on the plane is totally out of proportion to the number of casualties and problems the plane is in. Subseqeuntly the methods used by the passengers to defeat the snakes and land the plane is outrageous! And all these exaggerated facts make the movie perfect for an easy night out or on the couch watching it. It as a movie without a good plot and it really is about snakes on plane.

963,mthomasm,A post-modernist touchstone,7,21 August 2006,"It is possible that some of the absurdities of SOAP's plot were carried out in full sincerity (for example, the film's director was a ""junior pro surfer""), but in the end, the film operates as a self-conscious bizarro comedy-slash-horror movie, in that order--the humor is mostly intentional, as opposed to the ""so bad it's good"" quality that most people anticipated. SOAP's sentiments, in theory, make it comparable to a Troma-produced film with an unlimited budget; it goes without saying that the former is ""slicker,"" but both share an anarchic sense of social commentary-via-satire that results in a surprising amount of substance for such stupid (and knowingly hilarious) subject matter. That its opening gross was only $15 million was likely a blessing in disguise: continuing on this track could save the film from a Napoleon Dynamite-like kitsch idolatry, effectively keeping the movie's legacy rooted in its aesthetics rather than its winking goofiness. That being said, SOAP is far from perfect; its more blatant attempts at comedy are stale--its funniest material is low-key and subtle (like the part towards the beginning where rapper Three G's is walking with his entourage and says ""man, we gotta get some more of this stuff"" as the camera reveals him using Purell hand sanitizer).

Seeing this film alone in your basement could potentially be one of the most painful cinematic experiences plausible, but I can say from personal experience that seeing it in a theater with a large group of enthusiastic individuals was a blast. There were snakes on genitals, snakes in microwaves, karate-chopped snakes, harpooned snakes, and a glistening Samuel L.

966,shadow_chair,"Don't wait for the DVD, see this in the theater",10,18 August 2006,"I caught the ten o'clock Thursday premier of this movie, and I'm really  glad I did, because it was one of the greatest theater experiences I've  ever had. Nothing but snake-o-philes in the whole place, whooping and  cheering and yelling random crap at the screen. It was amazing seeing  all the hype surrounding this movie totally pay off.  And it does. I do have to admit that I was one of those people who  started to become skeptical as the deadline for this movie drew near.  While I was still determined to see it (my friends and I had already  amassed a group of about twenty people), I couldn't help but shake the  feeling that some of the nay-sayers surrounding this film would turn  out to be right in some way; that the movie was only funny as an idea,  that all the ridiculous hype would be the only enjoyable part of the  whole experience, that the joke had gotten old. What a fool I was. What  a thoughtless, Godless, close-minded fool.  Because this movie delivers. Up and beyond all of my hopeful  expectations. It isn't just ""so bad it's good,"" it's actually freaking  awesome. I can't even describe it without getting overexcited. Just  trust me, anyone who ""got it"" prior to the film's release will be amply  rewarded, in spades. It's exactly what we were all building it up to be  and more.  From the opening credits listing ""Snakes"" as a member of the cast, to  the theme song music video at the end, you'll be hooked. Remember that  random, totally retarded scene in Devil May Cry 3 where Dante whips out  a guitar and starts rocking out for no reason? Well the same thing that  made that scene work is the same thing that makes this whole movie work  despite its total implausibility and lack of intelligence: it's just  pure Hollywood. Everything about S.O.A.P. is just so insane and  over-the-top that even things that most likely weren't even intended to  be funny are still gut-wrenchingly hilarious. Take, for example, the  shameless product placement. I think I saw about fifty cans of Red Bull  within the first fifteen minutes, and every time one of them appeared  the audience would erupt with laughter. The great thing about this  movie is that it actually takes itself seriously, but the fact that it  even exists at all is just such a parody in itself that everything  about it is funny even when it's not supposed to be.  And trust me, while Samuel L Jackson's now-infamous, ""motha****in'  snakes"" line is one of the greatest parts of the movie (it got a  freaking standing ovation in my theater), it certainly doesn't hog the  spotlight for long. There are plenty of classic one-liners and random  moments for you and your idiot friends to repeat to each other over and  over until the end of time--one of my friends even boasted that he'll  be using, ""****ing snake, get off my dick!"" as his senior quote in the  high school yearbook. And there is plenty of senseless,  South-Park-level violence, gore and even nudity to keep you well  entertained and thinking ""WTF?"" throughout the whole thing. And this is  coming from a guy who typically doesn't appreciate things like that in  movies. Even the horribly cheesy CGI effects on the snakes come off as  brilliant. Snakes on a Plane just somehow manages to make everything  work. It's like there's some kind of magic aura surrounding it.  I could keep writing about this movie until the cows come home, but I'd  like to have an open schedule so that I can view it again multiple  times. So in short: **** the nay-sayers, this movie is ****ing  ingenious. Thanks to the guy who had the audacity to write this script,  thanks to the studio who had the balls to even consider producing this  movie, thanks to Samuel L Jackson for generally being a badass  mother****er and signing on to the project after only reading the  title.

The black mamba is probably the only exception. And no constrictor can consume a full grown adult.The fastest killing venom (Belcher's Sea-snake) takes 2 minutes minimum to kill, but the snakes were killing in under a minute. Some of the snakes in the movie take 15-120 minutes to kill a person.A few unrealistic events would be forgivable, but it was almost 100% unrealistic.

I thought it was going to be dumb when I saw the trailers, but I was surprised. I have two fears:1)Snakes2)Flying on Airplanes Snakes on a Plane stuffed both of my fears at the same time. From the brutal beginning to the jump out climax this movie packed enough campy special effects scares to satisfy the sick person who laughed at Hostel. Samuel L. Jackson made the movie for me. He delivers the line, that is already on the IMDb quotes list, ""Let's get these mother***king snakes off this mother***king plane!!!"" That sums up the movie without exposing any major plot developments. The only thing I didn't like was the ending, but unlike other movies out now, such as Lady in the Water, this ending makes sense for this movie.

At different points throughout the movie, I found my heat racing, my fists pumping, my hands clenched to the cupholders, or my eyes flooding with tears. Yes, I was crying. Indeed this film defies the mere words that seek to describe it.The characters were so elaborately crafted and the events so beautifully choreographed and executed, that ""Snakes on a Plane"" must be the most immersive cinematographic experience ever. If this had been made in 3D, I doubt I would have survived the viewing without being seriously traumatized.From the way the snakes were animated to the way they inflicted horrible death on their victims, the special effects were truly amazing. To see all these hundred of snakes wreaking havoc in the cabin of this plane was absolutely horrifying. These snakes slaughtered their victims in every way possible. Biting, strangulation, leaping towards various body parts, from eyes to throats, from nipples to penises.

You could tell everyone was pumped up and excited, and not just there to watch a movie, but to participate. The audience screamed when they turned half the lights off, before the trailers even started. Then people were booing half the trailers, demanding snakes instead. (They seemed to like Borat and Tenacious D, though.) They went really crazy when the title came on, and then when Sam Jackson first appears, when the plane takes off, etc.In fact, I don't think there's ever been another case of people getting so excited about an establishing shot of a plane taking off. :)The movie managed to live up to the audience's expectations. It knew exactly how to get the audience to holler and shout every few minutes. I'm kind of impressed, actually. It basically got a nearly Rocky Horror level of cult classic enthusiasm... before it was even released. And then it actually did not disappoint!It was a great time. I mean, the crowd was so loud that we actually managed to miss most of Jackson's signature line from the movie! But it didn't matter: Most of the crowd knew what it was anyway, and when people caught the tail end of the line, they screamed again!I definitely recommend that people go see it opening weekend when the rowdy crowds will still be around..

Sure it was predictable, contained almost every single cliché available to man (sex scene = first death, cute kids are spared, the ubiquitous fear-of-flying guy with the xanax, and mean American-hating-foreign guy getting eaten by a boa constrictor), but it delivered.But it was exciting. Chock full of conflict, after conflict. The characters were one-dimensional, but who cares, if I wanted quirky characters I would've seen Little Miss Sunshine again. It was well paced, and even the more boring exposition was tolerable, because we as the audience all knew what was coming.The hype engine obviously worked, at my theater a chant started during the previews, there were many kids hissing, and just as many in SoaP t-shirts (purchased and homemade). And after nearly every single line from Jackson, applause. It was definitely a ritual participation movie, and a cultural phenomenon I was glad to be a part of.Grab a few friends, a bucket of popcorn and see Snakes on a Plane...and oh yeah, if you want to have a good time, be sure not to forget to bring your suspension of disbelief.",Snakes on a Plane
972,rojenks,This Movie Had Everything I wanted to see and More,5,20 August 2006,"Here some of my favorite scenes - The snake that bit the girls nipple.The lights go out and you here someone in the background yell ""It's the Snakes!"" - Samuel Jackson gets back from turning the AC and lights back on and the hot stewardess give Samuel Jackson A kinda awkward hug.When Mercades is cornered by snakes and the Asian kickboxer randomly comes out and she jumps on his back.Everything the Snake expert said.The Chase scene from the helicopter view of the snake supplier.In the End all the guys get the girls phone #'s, like thats the only thing on there minds after a nightmare of flight.",Snakes on a Plane
973,hotguy696,Incredible,10,18 August 2006,"I don't ever write these things. After seeing Snakes on a Plane, however, I feel I have to. I have never been more entertained at a movie in my entire life. This movie kept me laughing, screaming, and holding my breath so much that, by the end of the movie, I was near exhaustion. Not only is this movie of great quality, but it is also of great wit, it's marketing scheme being a work of genius. The acting, in my opinion, is as good as it could be with such material. S.L.J. is as hard and bad@$$ as you could expect. I was thoroughly overjoyed by such appearances as Kenan Thompson, from my childhood favorite All That, and now of Saturday Night Live. He was perfect in a role that could use his great comedic timing in a non-comedic movie. I also loved seeing Rachel Blanchard, the star of the TV series Clueless, in a role that she has played millions of times before. Special Effects: pretty good! A final note: whilst watching this movie, all I could think of was how this movie will become the Rocky Horror Picture Show of this generation. I just hope they don't wait long!",Snakes on a Plane
974,Tranorix,Samuel L. Jackson? Check. Snakes? Check. A plane? Check.,10,18 August 2006,"What do those add up to? The perfect movie...or at least the most fun.I won't spoil anything because indeed, half the fun of Snakes lies in not knowing what hilariously awesome event is coming next, but rest assured, if you go into this movie expecting to laugh your a** off, it's going to happen. I went to a midnight showing (giant rubber snake in hand) with some friends and we had the time of our lives.Samuel L. Jackson is at his most Samuel L. Jackson (the absolute highest praise possible), delivering his lines with the great vengeance and furious anger only he can pull off. I sincerely doubt a more perfect role exists for everyone's favorite BMF.The other lead, the witness, whose name escapes me because it's really not important at all, has a total of two expressions throughout the movie: worried/scared, and happy. Some might consider his bad acting a flaw, but believe me, it isn't. Getting genuinely good actors for every role would only give SoaP the impression that it was trying to take itself seriously, and that, quite frankly, would suck.The only other performance of note is Kenan's, and although Kel is conspicuously absent, it's really a lot of fun. Toward the end of the movie, his character takes on greater importance...and believe me, it's awesome.And the ending? Oh wow...the ending. I won't say anything other than it's the dumbest (and therefore best) ending possible.Snakes on a Plane is not a horror movie, and it's not a thriller. It is a comedy: and it's a comedy with, dare I say, the potential to become the next Rocky Horror.",Snakes on a Plane
975,send-2,This movie exceeded all expectations.,10,18 August 2006,"First, I must state that I saw this movie with a friend, and that is all. The theater we were in for the opening night, 11:30 PM show was empty except for my friend and myself. Many comments on IMDb.com state that the crowd makes this a great experience, but this movie blew me away when I was with just one buddy.Snakes on a Plane has it all. There were scenes that made me laugh harder than any movie EVER has. There was great action, memorable one liners, suspenseful build-ups and even a scene or two that could provoke a tear from some. I even got scared at one point. I love the feeling of a good scare and Snakes on a Plane throws one right into your lap. It was great. Everything you could want in a movie can be found in Snakes on a Plane. This movie had the GREATEST death scenes ever.As I watched the movie, I would often think ""Oh man, it'd be great if this happened."" But from my past movie experiences my next thought was ""But they'd never show that though..."" BUT NO. Snakes on a Plane throws all your expectations out of the window and does the unconventional. I don't want to give anything away but let me tell you that Snakes on a Plane does not wuss out on a single thing. This movie kicks so much ass for not going down the typical Hollywood path and leading you to believe that something completely kick ass will happen only to then blue ball you. Snakes on a Plane lets you blow your load of excitement all over it's face. I will be seeing this movie many more times and buying the DVD. It just kicks that much ass.",Snakes on a Plane
976,bigd02uk,Huh?? Did that really just happen???,1,1 September 2006,".....where does one begin? On suggesting we head to the pictures for a cheap & cheerful Thursday night, my friend added ""..I'd like to see Snakes On A Plane"". Well, i thought, not a chance with a title like that. After much pressure, i have a mooch on the 1st few pages of reviews on IMDb.com, and see 10 stars everywhere. I quickly forgive my friend , call up a few others, and rush to the 8.45pm showing, eager in anticipation. So we get there, the film starts, and I think i'm in the wrong place- nay- the wrong time period!! Some cheesy bloke who looks like Vinny 'The V-man' from Home & Away, or any other extra from a cheap Aussie soap show, witnesses a Yakuza dude smash some guys head in like a pinata, with a baseball bat. I dismiss the bad-casting of 'Vinny' and think this could be a good one.. And what follows??? Samuel L. Jackson delivers a line which almost rivals his 'Ezekiel 25:17' speech from Pulp Fiction, when he screams 'I've had it with these motherf*ckin snakes on this motherf*kin plane!', followed closely by, 'That's it, time to open some motherf*ckin windows!'. Also thrown into the mix is a Chinese kick-boxer karate chopping a snake in two, whilst simultaneously quoting from the kungfu greats like Karate kid 1 (or 2) and Hong-Kong Fui as he yells 'Hiiiiii-yaaaa!!'. We also have a camp flight attendant who (surprise surprise) turns out to be straight; Sammy L. stun gunning 20 snakes, one after the other; a 60ft snake swallow a passenger while all the other passengers watch... the list goes on, ending with Samuel L. Jackson surfing into the horizon (!!!) at the end of the movie, despite the fact he and the other bloke should be counselling, either for all the traumatic death they've just witnessed, or because of the sh1te they've just created that is this film.And as for those dastardly snakes: I can just see the screenwriters going into a secondary school class of 13 year old boys, full of hormones and mid-puberty- ""OK kids, think of the best ways a snake can attack a human, then once you've thought of a few, come up here and write it on the board"".. The teacher, Miss Walker, stands and is about to scream at young 'Gaz' as he writes ""Bite someones wiener off"", but the screenwriter quickly stops her, whilst his assistant dashes these ideas into his jotter. Up steps young 'Tommy'; Miss Walker leaves the classroom, appalled, as his idea of ""go up the skirt of a drunk, fat lady and fondle her"" is met by a rapturous applause from the 2 screen writing geeks. ""Anything else?"" Wayne's hand shoots up: ""how about bite some fat bloke in the ass?"" 'Yup, we'll take it'. ""Bite someone in the eye?"" 'Lovin it kids, lovin it'.So that was the writing process. Now can someone please tell me how the genre of 'Satirical comedy' wasn't mentioned?? Apparently it was a horror??! CHAMP KIND FROM ANCHORMAN WAS THE F*CKING PILOT!!!!! What was Samuel L. Jackson thinking?? I tell you what, it did make me laugh, but only because the music video at the end was so p0rno it confirmed to me that perhaps this movie must have been totally taking the p1ss, and in fact I've been so busy congratulating myself on guessing that with a title like (SoaP) it must be crap, and, indeed, it was, that, indeed it was perhaps pure genius and a complete mockery of the audience???? With that, i too nearly gave it a 10 star rating. But i didn't. It gets 1 star. The funny thing is though, i can't even say 'Don't watch it', because it probably is one of the funniest films of the year. But totally unintentionally. I'm just glad Sammy L. has made some good films before- every other actor in this film should never receive a movie role again. Unless it is in a film that uses puppets, not actors, and the puppets are all turds, who just walk around all day. pottering. Not doing much. And it's in black & white. And it's written, directed, produced & guest-starring a turd on a string. That's drunk. And called 'Chris'.I think this is an important and frank review that the public demands to see",Snakes on a Plane
977,MoviePoopLuke90,Funnest Dumbest movie ever,9,19 August 2006,"folks when i first heard about this movie i thought ""wow thats stupid"" and i also wondered ""how lazy could the producers be with the title"" but then i realized that this was not just a sci-fi. this was more comedy than sci-fi. i enjoyed this movie and laughed at those who died because most of them deserved it. i found it funny how in one of the scenes Sam jackson had to go and fix the AC and it looked just like in Jurassic park when they tried to fix the power. i was waiting for an arm to fall on Samuel. the best part was the suspense of wondering whether Sam was gonna die or not because seeing the trailer we all knew this was one of those films for him. but i was glad he survived in the end because most of the time the movies he does die in, the ones who survive are douchebags. the people who don't want to see this movie are all stubborn because this is a film where you can have fun. i remember seeing a friend of mine who was going to see accepted and i just thought. wow why the hell should i go see accepted when i can go see snakes a mothaf**king plane!",Snakes on a Plane
978,badrock5,Sam Jackson on a Plane!,9,17 August 2006,"I will make this short as possible.This movie was amazing! The commercials just show you snakes and you know Samuel Jackson is in it.It's so much more than that and I recommend every person who is hating on this movie to go see it and actually have a reason to hate it.This movie has its elements of horror, action, comedy, touch of romance, and even i guess you could say a dash of teen spirit due to a few small things. Plus there's enough gore to make any horror fan happy.Man this is more of a ""in case of snakes on a plane, do this..."" kind of movie. It's neat seeing people react to the situation and It's so realistic.NOW GO AND SEE THIS MOVIE! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!",Snakes on a Plane
979,gregieb0i,Snakes on a Plane,7,20 August 2006,"When it came to actually seeing Snakes on a Plane I was a bit nervous from all the hype thats been brought upon itself. But when I came out the theater it was worth my ticket price.OK so of course your going to get your snakes just like you read. Which is the plus really suspenseful stuff, at one point I had my sister's BIG boyfriend scream during the movie along with the rest of the audience. So if your into the suspense, comedy, and thriller your in for it. Also you get Samuel Jackson in the movie saying his trade mark cussing lines ^_^ Heres the SHORT down fall to the movie. If your expecting a award winning movie, well your not. So you could stop posting and whining about the hype and etc on the forums. The other is that the story is kind of all too fast in the beginning but thats in my opinion and so is the ending. But that shouldn't stop you from watching the movie. Besides that, thats about it.Overall go watch the film even if your against it you'll come out with a smile. Or if your that much of a prick you'll at least one smile from and walk out with a disgusted face.",Snakes on a Plane
980,lego_dude88,A stunning motion picture masterpiece,10,18 August 2006,"The first time I heard about the film, I didn't believe it. I couldn't comprehend that a movie with such a perfectly fitting title for its plot line had been conceived. But it had.The following months were full of anticipation. I checked for SLJ television appearances. I dutifully read all of the background and stories about the film. I RSVPed to the local ""Snakes On A Motherfarking Fark Party."" My expectations rose and rose for the film with every mention, even just of different brands of soap. I had never been more excited for a mere movie release in my life.Today, the day finally arrived. I picked up my tickets many hours before the showtime, only to be greeted by a clairvoyant ticket saleswoman - she had no reservations in guessing the movie I was there for - and what else could it have been, I ask you? The excitement in the movie theatre was palpable. Just the mention of the film in the coming features section brought the audience to cheers. Then, before I knew it, the lights dimmed, and I was sitting in front of the feature presentation the world was made for - there weren't even any previews - it was truly magical.Now, I must admit something. Before the film began, I had reservations that the film may not live up to the expectations I had set out for it. I mean, I expected nothing less than film perfection - and, realistically, I didn't think that even SOAP could stand up to the impossible standards I'd set out. I was sorely mistaken. Every moment of the film filled me with utter glee - the regular vulgarity, gratuitous nudity, general SLJ bad-assness, and of course, constant venomous snakey violence. I was not bored for a moment of the movie. Not to mention, the cheers from the rightfully and explosively excited crowd made my movie-watching experience that much more appealing.On the drive home from the theatre, I couldn't help myself smiling from ear to ear. I had an unexplainable feeling of euphoria, as if the pleasure of ""Snakes on a Plane"" could last me a lifetime. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys cinema, a good time, or even wants a fresh outlook on life. I promise all - there will be no disappointment on this plane.",Snakes on a Plane
981,blork101,Greatest. Film. Ever.,10,18 August 2006,"As with so many others, I first heard about this film on the internets; and man, I was blown away by the concept. What I wasn't expecting was for the film to be SO AWESOME in every way. It's scary. It's exciting.It's tense. And it is absolutely hilarious. I was fully expecting this movie to be ""so bad it's good"" - what I got was ""so good it blew my mind"". Despite a slow beginning, once they are on-board that motherfuckin' plane the action is non-stop; you owe it to yourself to see this film.In fact, I order you to. And in the words of Sam Jackson himself, ""Do as I say, and you'll live!"".",Snakes on a Plane
982,jennifer-eve,Snakes on a Plane - Definitely worth the price of admission,8,28 August 2006,"Saw this yesterday, it's a good movie!! There are actually a couple of moments that are startling/suspenseful. It's not overly campy. A good way to escape reality for 90 minutes, and actually worth paying for to see at the cineplex - way more fun that way.Samuel L. Jackson makes this a lot of fun and yes, does have some of the best lines in the film.The pacing was really good, there wasn't a minute that I spent bored or looking at my watch.No one seemed to mind that the plot was threadbare. The writers wasted no time in letting the audience see actual (well, CGI-ed most of the time) snakes on a fake plane. I was surprised to see Julianna Margulies in this.The only warning I would issue is - this is NOT a kids movie. One family brought their 5 year old to the screening that I was at. This movie is definitely NOT appropriate for kids under 16.Snakes + planes + Samuel L Jackson = B movie Heaven",Snakes on a Plane
983,imp_fiend,An Instant Cult Classic,10,18 August 2006,"Just coming back from the theater (unfortunately, only about 24 people were seeing SOAP), I can honestly say that this is one of the campiest, cheesiest films I've seen in ages. It's style seems more akin to the earlier movies of Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson rather than a big budget Hollywood movie.That's why it's so enjoyable. Snakes on a Plane is brilliant in it's simplicity and becomes a truly good film instead of ""so bad it's good,"" It's purely entertaining. Samuel L. Jackson says every line that anyone would want him to say. The under crowded theater that I was in stood up and cheered at times, mostly with some of the inventive gratuitous (but ""B"" movie charming) violence.In ten years, people will be seeing midnight showings of this film, throwing rubber snakes at the screen.",Snakes on a Plane

All I can say is WOW.,10,26 August 2006,"Going into this movie, I was only expecting the ridiculousness it seemed that a movie titled ""Snakes on a Plane"" would bring. But really, it was one of the greatest movies I have seen all year. It was hilarious, thrilling and so exciting and unexpected. Samuel L. Jackson gave a very expected, very awesome performance that would be expected of Sammy J. The only minor problem with the movie at first is its character development, but once the major action begins, it is much easier to follow. All in all, this movie was so awesome and as long as you have a good sense of humor, enjoy great action and are not expecting to take the whole plot about snakes on a plane seriously, you will definitely love it.Two major thumbs up, way up.",Snakes on a Plane

It's a thrill ride, it has great laughs and great scares! The action never lets up - it's like a roller coaster ride to the very end. I've even heard that groups of people are going, and taking props and shouting out lines when they go see it. Now, what ticks me off is that much of the media seems to be trying to take something away from this movie -suggesting that just having fun at a movie is somehow wrong.....huh??? So I hope you will join me and go see it again and again - it IS the most fun you'll have at the movies this year!",Snakes on a Plane

The snakes were awesome, Samuel was awesome, and the plot, while a bit far-fetched, still made sense. There are some great killing scenes in this movie to rival any horror movie, plus enough laughs, intentional and unintentional, to call it a action-comedy. This movie, in my opinion, deserves to win whatever awards that it is nominated for. And if it isn't nominated for any, that's a shame. Never has a movie made me need to applause at the end, but i did for this movie. Anyways, i will stop rambling and tell you to go see this movie, it will be the best time of your life!",Snakes on a Plane

The movie has some funny parts but other than them, it's a complete bore. At more than one instance during the film, I thought about leaving the movie theater and going out to the highway to lay in traffic. The recently added scene to increase the rating from PG13 to R was probably the best scene in the entire movie even though it was a shameless attempt to get more people to go watch this sub-par movie. If you do decide to bring you children to this movie, do not do so lightly. This movie has turned my fun loving kids into raging alcoholics and substance abusers. When I asked them why, their unanimous reason was they were trying to forever forget this movie.

The people at the theatre were hilarious and everyone seemed like they had fun and that they sounded like they liked the movie as much as I did. The movie went from a joke to a serious movie, then it was actually pretty funny. Some parts were pretty gruesome and the snakes were pretty cool. Samuel L. Jackson owned this movie. The movie worked very well for such a simple plot and had more to it than you'd have thought. This movie had so many priceless lines, and the famous Samuel L. Jackson line is worth my $6.95 alone.

But on Saturday a friend wanted me to see it with him on Sunday, and between the time we made the plans on Saturday and actually saw it on Sunday, I started getting excited about it, albeit in the ""Rosemary's Baby"" kind of manner - I thought it would be so horrible to watch that it would be impossible to turn away.However, I was very pleasantly surprised. As other comments have said, don't come to watch this movie if you're looking for something serious. However, if you're looking for something campy and fun, this is just the ticket. There were scenes that made me cringe, scenes that made me jump, and scenes that made me laugh out loud. Not because they were funny, but because they were so over the top.I'll describe this to my friends as ""the best bad movie you'll likely ever see"". It's B-movie material for sure and is destined to be standard fare at fraternity parties and stupid movie night. I think it's even possible to get a Rocky Horror type of following with this - I could think of several places in the movie where audience participation would make the experience an event.Go see it.

If you had to go to the WC during the movie, I assure you, you would hold it in , till the end. I loved every bit of it!

As time went on and I heard they re-shot 5 days so Jackson could have more lines, and more violence, I admit I was impressed, I like the sound of that., more action, and more ""pulp fiction"" like lines but I was intrigued, how could they make a film about wild snakes on a plane and how would that last, the entire length of the film, but they have, and really well too.The Start of the film perfectly paced for a thriller/horror movie, all exposition is in the right place, it all lead nicely to the action, which when it starts, it rarely stops.The film really get the empathy for the passengers, I felt like I had favourites I didn't want to die, and one I didn't like and wanted to be bitten.Through out the film, I was entertained and excited, the cinema even applauded when the ""mother fu**ing snakes on this mother fu**ing plane"" line was said.Unfortunately the downside to the entire film was all the product placement, but all that aside, a really good film with lots of Jackson stereotypes for the pulp fans.

Jackson, and a lot of kick ass deaths.I went to this movie with a bunch of friends and had a blast. The whole theater would cheer when Samuel killed a snake and feel the pain of the passengers when we witnessed a cruel death. I cried many a times while watching this movie, and not because i was afraid but because i was laughing too hard.

994,loonytoon1982,Snakes On A Motherfucking Plane!!!,9,16 October 2006,"I know on first thoughts that the premise for Snakes On A Plane wont be something that most people would be interested in but over the past year the movie has gained a huge cult following which has helped it reach the top of movie charts in both the US and in the UK, to sum up what I have said already... It's well worth that following The main reason for this in my opinion is Sam Jackson is one bad ass guy. Every character he portrays on screen has such a prominent screen presence and Snakes on a Plane is no different. He takes every scene, every line and every fight, then he makes it his own. Now although he is the star of the show, the main characters are the snakes, and they do not disappoint at all. There are pretty much hundreds of snakes on board the flight including copperheads, cobras, black mambas, and even an anaconda, which is realistically impossible but fun nonetheless.I wouldn't come as much of a surprise is there was every kind of snake imaginable in this movie. They wreak venomous terror for the passengers on board. Every single snake attack is likely to cause you to jump out of your seat, and a few of them offer the kind of gore that will delight new and old horror fans alike.Especially look out for one scene involving every mans fear... Snakes in the Toilet ;) Director David Ellis pretty much pulls off one of the movies of the year so far with his movie full of unrealistic situations, character clichés, and cheesy dialogue that it's full of humour from the moment people board the plane with lots of comic foreshadowing""at least it can't get any worse"" one cranky passenger complainsbut all that humour does is put you off your guard and reinforce the expected campiness. Once people start dying in violent and gruesome ways, it stops being a comedy and starts being a straight horror-thriller.To finish off this is definitely not for everyone. Action-thriller-horror movies generally get killed by critics because they're so uptight... but what do they know anyway. ;) Ellis takes the phobias of flying on a plane and snakes to a whole different level, so if you are a fan of 1980's cheesy horror, sit back and enjoy the flight. Snakes on a Plane is hit movie that is not to be missed.",Snakes on a Plane

Alas, it was just plain, outright bad... what a waste of time. Bad story, bad dialogue, bad acting (but who could act those lines?!?), and bad visual effects. Stay home, read a book, and give that ticket money to charity!To put this in perspective, I *do* like action movies. I had no expectations that this would elevate my mind to new, unexplored higher levels. But there's a fine line between requesting your viewers to suspend disbelief and treating them like idiots.

998,dotfortune,Snakes on the brain.,10,18 August 2006,"For the past few months, I have dragged into the hype that is Snakes on a Plane. And I went into theaters with little expectations. But, those were shattered promptly as the movie began. The movie takes itself just seriously enough. All the actors play they parts, albeit, a little stereotypical. But thats what makes it fun, the guys who suck, die, the people who don't, don't die. All the scenes with the snakes are gory, well as gory as you could possibly get with snakes...and a microwave in one scene. And let's not forget Samuel L. Jackson. The self proclaimed bad m******* plays his part extremely well. If your in for the first really fun movie this summer, go see Snakes on a Plane.",Snakes on a Plane
999,ivylicious,The Internet Phenomenon doesn't disappoint!,10,18 August 2006,"As a movie catered to the fans, this movie was everything I expected it to be and more. Even if you cannot get behind the subject matter of hundreds of venomous snakes aboard a large plane, you can at least respect the film for its feedback-based creation. It started out as a joke and the movie is entirely self-aware of what it is and that makes it all the more beautiful for viewers.Anyone who has been following the hype knows that scenes were re-shot to bump up the rating from PG-13 to R and it shows. Gruesome deaths and disfigurement were obviously shoved in there to please all of us blood hungry fans and it is an amazing effort. Eyes are torn out, nipples are latched on to, and people are consumed by anacondas, what more could you ask for? The dialog ranges from snappy to completely witless, but you're not here for the dialog, you're really only there for ""motherfcuking snakes on a motherfcuking plane"". My only complaint is the fact that not one snake is kicked in the face even though there is a kick-boxer on board.If you don't understand why anyone is excited about this movie, I'm afraid you just don't really understand it. It isn't about making something _worth_ watching, it's about the sheer gall and enthusiasm that the project has. It's about the communication between production crews and the public. It's about complete understanding of how ridiculous and fantastic it really is.You cannot explain Snakes on a Plane because, really, it should explain itself.",Snakes on a Plane

It soon became readily apparent that no matter how interesting the concept seemed to be, the enormous amount of bloopers, poor dialog, and factual errors was going to detract from any enjoyment of said movie. This of course assuming the viewer has an I.Q. of over 30. The action scenes, which is about 90% of the movie, can be easily understood to appeal to young boys in the 7 to 12 age group but should not be seeing this movie anyway due to the violence and disgusting nature of this film's content. I am truly surprised that such an accomplished actor like Jackson would even consider being in this ""gem"". See this movie if what you desire is seeing snakes bite humans & pets in all imaginable body parts.",Snakes on a Plane
1001,christopher-r-higgins,Snakes On Crack?,9,19 August 2006,"Okay, so this movie was rather hyped since like March. I know that I had already made plans to take off work for it (which I did, of course); in fact, me and all my friends took off work for it.And I was not disappointed. Though, to be fair, I did not anticipate that the movie would actually be GOOD, but rather just so horrendously bad that it would be funny. (I know what you're thinking: Samuel L. in a bad movie? Blasphemy!) The plot did seem a little shaky at points, and I would have liked for the snakes' entrance to be a little more subtle. But I must say, the deaths, though predictable, were morbidly funny. Samuel L. Jackson is the only one who could have done this, and he did it perfectly.The reason why it didn't get 10? The end credits. I won't give it away, but after the movie is over, the end credits make you just go ""wtf?""",Snakes on a Plane

All the nay sayers were wrong and I'm proud to say SOAP lived up to the hype. Even my friend in the audience who we dragged along and had never heard of SOAP loved it.I can't think of a better movie I've seen this year and it wouldn't have been nearly as good without the re-shoots the fans clamored for.

Snakes on a plane. 50 rocket scientists agreed that the concept/general plot leaves something to be desired, so don't expect much more than a good time.That said, this movie is a good time. I went to the opening with a crowd mostly composed of high school and college aged kids. As funny as the movie is, it gets better with a energized youthful audience. There were many instances where the crowd (ahem, audience) started cheering wildly, likely disturbing other theaters. You might not want to go to the movie playing next to Snakes on a Plane.The movie delivers what you SHOULD be expecting, and it does so in large doses. Next to Superman Returns and Pirates II, this is the most enjoyable movie of the summer. Yes, this includes Talledaga Nights and crap like Miami Vice. Do as I say and you'll live.",Snakes on a Plane
1004,xonik-1,This movie is everything great about campy movies,9,18 August 2006,"I usually dislike campy movies. They oftentimes try too hard at what they're doing and come off as unfunny, or they stray into more serious territory and make the campy aspects feel even more insincere than they should. Then you have movies like Army Of Darkness and Dead Alive, which set themselves exactly in the middle and do the best job, balancing seriousness and idiocy for an all-out laugh riot.Snakes On A Plane does the latter, and it all goes to Sam Jackson. Who else could take a character like Agent Flynn and make him into something you can cheer and laugh at with equal intensity? Of course, it's Sam Jackson playing Sam Jackson, but that's what everyone who's hyped up about this movie wants to see. Sure, the film doesn't have the same feel as early Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson material, but it accomplishes its goal in a completely different way.The common thing between those movies, though? The director and all of the actors are doing their job while giving you a big fat wink. That's why this movie will be what our kids watch when they're in college and want to see some good old fashioned camp.",Snakes on a Plane

Without Samuel L. Jackson i would have given 1/10 to this one, this really goes into the category of worst movies ever, damn horrible crap... Before this movie i watched Schindler's List and well lol you cant even compare this movie to that one, this one doesn't have anything while LIST is 10/10 kind of a movie.If you value your money, don't rent of buy this one !",Snakes on a Plane
1006,flamingdiscofire,What a surprise! An excellent film I never expected,10,22 August 2006,"Before going to see Snakes On A Plane, I was convinced that I was going to hate the film with a passion. As it turns out, the movie was far better than I could have expected and may perhaps be one of my favorite films of the year. I spent the whole time anticipating the next minute, and found the plot to be amazingly rich and interesting for such a seemingly simple movie. Going to see Snakes On A Plane is most certainly not a bad choice, you will spend each moment wondering which emotion the film will evoke next. I highly recommend the movie to everyone, but especially to those who are skeptical about such a seemingly lame sounding movie.",Snakes on a Plane
1007,samuraioutlaw,Samuel L. Jackson kept his promise!!!,10,18 August 2006,"Wow, I have to admit I wasn't sure this would be a good movie. The concept of just snakes on a plane seemed really stupid to me at first. But the movie plays out like no other; imagine Jaws meets Air Force One meets Anaconda, with an amazing cast to boot. The movie has many different themes to it as well; such as drama, action, suspense, romance and comedy. In a nutshell, Snakes on a Plane is the perfect movie. It literally has something for all audiences, well unless they're deathly afraid of snakes, flying an closed spaces. Samuel L. Jackson promised this to be the greatest film ever made, and he did not disappoint.",Snakes on a Plane
1008,HoboPig,"If you want to like it, I guarantee you will",10,18 August 2006,"It's hard to describe this movie properly but I'll give it a shot. I'll start off by saying that I have never enjoyed a movie so much. This may be up there with Robot Monster and Plan 9 in horrible writing and plot holes and the like, but there is nothing like being in a theater packed full of people who are loving every strange moment of it with you. As everyone in the theater screams ""MOTHER OF GOD!"" when someone gets offed in a zany way or the collective cheer when Samuel utters the infamous line. If you go into this movie expecting a serious movie or a well thought out plot then go and just get a refund because you will not enjoy it. But if there is a part of you deep inside that gets excited when there is gratuitous nudity and violence, and you love it when they curse for no reason then you will love this movie.

1009,leftydan,What the?,2,27 August 2006,"This movie shows what some publicity and a bunch of cult classic hunters can do to hype things up regardless of how bad the movie is. The main draw I assume was the different body parts the snakes attack. Think of a crass area of the body to be bitten on and it was there. Even half drunk my buddy and I really didn't think it was very funny. I was hoping for the kung fu guy on the plane to get into it with the bad guy since that was the only way that the scene where you see the bad guy sparring would matter.... but it never does. I don't even think that they have the guy in jail so I am not sure why having a witness matters. Oh well, at least I had a good dinner that night cause the movie was a waste of time.",Snakes on a Plane
1010,tonilburk,SOAP is a lot of fun,9,21 August 2006,"Samuel L. Jackson made this movie a lot of campy fun. The plot was well thought out and meatier than expected. There are plenty of surprises and scares! Not for the faint of heart. The characters were a good mix, but in the end it was all about Sam Jackson. He played a good FBI agent who did all he could to protect his witness. It was hard to tell which snakes were real and which were CGI. If you are a pet lover, be prepared! Kenan was a fun addition to the story line. The beach scenes were breathtaking. I liked how they connected the story line to include the FBI working with the snake expert in Los Angeles trying to get anti-venom and discover where the snakes came from. This movie is a non stop action packed ride from start to finish!",Snakes on a Plane

1012,grbyow-1,quite funny,7,18 August 2006,"This movie could become a b-movie cult. It's light and mindless, will creep you out in several places (don't go see it if you have snake-phobia!) and will make you laugh quite a bit too. Go there, suspend your disbelief, join the ride and have fun. You'll probably know in advance all that's going to happen, but it doesn't really matter. The title really says it all. If you take a rather gory monster movie and blend it with an ""Airport 7x"", this is what you'd expect to see. The special effects vary from average to pretty good. You can definitely tell computer animation when you see it in this one, but overall that doesn't make the movie worse. It actually gave me a ""b-movie"" feeling, that was really nice. Samuel L. Jackson is very good (as usual). The other actors are OK, but nothing else (besides Jackson and the snakes) really has any relevance. I saw it at a sneak preview with a ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" kind of crowd and S.L.Jackson was getting applause and standing ovations. I have to say that it was the perfect crowd to see this movie with. Don't expect a masterpiece, though... But if you see it with the right spirit, you'll have a great time.",Snakes on a Plane
1013,Jaowel,"Ahhhhhhhh, there's a Snake!",5,30 August 2006,"I am never one to publicly cast negative reflections upon a movie. I haven't the slightest clue as to what people see so great in this film. Entertaining? Sure I guess so...physiologically/naturally incorrect (snakes), erroneous, full of continuity errors, HILARIOUS, you want to believe it!So instead of picking off the bad things about this movie, here are 5 good things about it: 1 - The random surprised yells you can hear in the background of the plane of people exclaiming ""Ahh! There's a snake!"" --hmmm. I guess they didn't expect to see another one.2 - When Samue L. (Nelville) came out of nowhere at the beginning of the movie and told Sean to be quiet ""Don't even breath!"" 3 - The Snake timer! 4 - Regular Groin and Boob bites.5 - The fact that Samue L. was in the film. This is the only reason why I give it a 5/10 Bonus: ""Enough is enough! I have had it with these motherf@#king snakes on this motherf@#king plane! If your goal is to go out and see an entertaining movie, drop by your local cinema and watch 'Snakes on Plane'. I wouldn't recommend doing so if you are looking for a reasonable plot, accurate reactions, rational thinking, realism, fear of snakes, or trying to decide which of two movies to choose from (pick the other).

But did SoaP live up to my every (and very high) expectation? YES. And then some.This movie is not for the feint of heart or those lacking a sense of humor, because in short this movie was a joke and the audience was the punch line. This movie hit on something that was unarguably genius and entertaining, if not ground breaking. For me the kid two rows behind me dressed up as a cardboard 747 and the audience enthusiasm was almost as good as Sam Jackson himself. This movie would be nothing without the fans, and I found it refreshing to watch something that was well disguised as a serious movie, but at the same time you could tell underneath they were laughing as hard as the audience. It wasn't a comedy grasping for laughs and played out jokes, but it wasn't a cheap horror film that is obviously meant to be taken seriously. It struck a happy medium of self-teasing with an action plot. It wouldn't have been a success without the hype, but no ones claiming its a cinematic work of art.I don't disagree with Ebert's 'one star' rating because as a FILM critic should look at it, it was bad. As a movie go-er however, I loved it and it was great for entertainment purposes, which, for me, is a good enough reason to see a movie.And if for no other reason go see it because of Sam F****** Jackson.",Snakes on a Plane

1017,timmarcol,The Theater Experience,9,18 August 2006,"I went to the sneak preview of SOaP last night (8-17-06) at the Annapolis Mall. I walked into the theater about an hour before the 10:00 PM start. There were about 20 people already in there; they all looked like high school kids. Over the next hour, as people walked in, the crowd got more and more excited. They started cheering people as they walked into the theater, occasionally booing them just for good measure/fun. I overheard many conversations that high school kids would have i.e. ""Where are you going to college?"" came up a few times. It was like a high school reunion or maybe the last summer get-together before going to college/back to high school.One group of kids brought in a stuffed plush snake and plopped it in a seat beside them. They also draped a rubber snake over a seat in front of them.While waiting for the movie to start the following group activities spontaneously happened:* A group started stomping their feet and hissing in unison (i.e. stomp-stomp-hiss; stomp-stomp-hiss) everyone joined in.* One kid got up in front of the theater and led a cheer where one half of the crowd yelled ""Snakes!"" and the other half yelled ""Plane!""; like we where at a football game, back and forth.* People just started chanting: ""Snakes! Snakes! Snakes!""Before the movie started two ushers came into the theater and told everyone not to talk during the movie, everyone laughed. But everyone cheered after they said ""and enjoy Snakes on a Plane!""Anyone who complains about people making too much noise during SOaP is missing the point of the movie. Crowd participation should be part of the experience.I noticed that there were maybe 5 people that were over 25 years old in the crowd, the theater was about ¾ full, but there were three other screens showing the movie at the same time.Cheers went up when the lights went down. When the commercials/previews came on outbursts of ""Just show mother****ing Snakes on a Plane!"" echoed.The crowd cheered and clapped during many occasions, here are few of them: When the movie started; When they showed Samuel L Jackson's name in the opening credits; The title ""Snakes on a Plane"" appeared on the screen; Samuel L. Jackson's character first appearance on screen; When a snake first appears on screen; Every time a snake was killed in a cool way; When Jackson yells at the passengers to stop panicking; When Jackson utters his famous line.Just about every snappy line or gruesome death got cheers/applause, even a few tender moments got applause. A little about the movie: The inclusion of two children as passengers (brothers flying alone) could have been very melodramatic but somehow was not. The movie is definitely not for those who are afraid of snakes or afraid of flying (surprise?!). The gore is over the top at times and earns its ""R"" rating. The sex scene (shows a woman's breasts) ends in classic shock horror fashion. I found myself caught up in the suspense for a while and was not sure how it was going to end. Very enjoyable! There is a music video at the end of the movie that is good for a few laughs too. Almost everyone stayed in the theater until the closing credits stopped rolling and the music stopped. Was everyone hoping for just one more snake to jump out? I know I was!""Sex, drugs, violence, and a f***ing Boa Constrictor!"" is what a kid exclaimed while exiting the theater.

In order to kill the witness before he can testify the crime lord (here comes the spoilers) puts snakes on a plane to do him in.I was expecting a movie so corny, bad, or cheesy that it would be funny; but I was pleasantly surprised. The first twenty minutes were pretty much that, so lame to the point of tickling my funny bone. But after that, I was surprised to find a movie that had a VERY good balance. There was the funny cheesy-ness of the first 20 minutes, the surprisingly interesting characters/character development, funny jokes, decent action, and EXCELLENT snake attacks/death scenes.I was excited about seeing this movie almost as a joke, but it ended up surprising me.

I'm sorry that I took time to watch this movie, I guess I need to update my netflix queue if this movie arrived, because it was definitely on the bottom. I guess if your in the mood to make fun of how terrible a movie is than this is a great one to do so. The gore/violence was way over played, it looked like I was watching a sci fi channel movie. The snakes were not even close to being realistic looking, maybe the solid red, blue, yellow, or purple snakes were meant to be ""extremely"" poisonous or something but they could have had that effect without using crayola colors.",Snakes on a Plane

I originally thought this movie was going to be really bad, maybe second to house of the dead. What I found, surprisingly, was a movie that was not that bad.Going into the movie, I had low expectations. The very first scenes, and dialogue for that matter, cue you into the fact that almost everybody in this movie is a horrible actor/actress. When you see the snakes, they look fake. The snakes are not scary. Taking all this, one would think, well this movie has to suck with the acting/dialogue/CGI combo. But it does not, as crazy as it is to say, the movie was fun. I think that sums it up. Fun, not something you will buy on video/DVD. But worth a watch. I found myself laughing during the movie, also a lot of the crowd also was laughing, and really getting into the movie. The movie delivers as a decent action film, surprisingly. There is a lot of graphic stuff in there. As well as a nudity/sex scene. Also strong language. If I was to look at this as a actual film, and be serious about it. Well, why would I be seeing this movie. Its selling point is how outrageous it is.

And when it was over i to was upset because i did end up actually liking it . It turned out to actually ended up looking real to. The acting was actually believable to, the only thing i was very upset about was when the little chiwawa was thrown to the anaconda snake or whatevr it was.

That means their king snakes, which aren't poisonous at all. Also, the bright blue snakes? Most of the snakes didn't even look like real snakes.

The film simply doesn''t work... as a horror movie.However, I enjoyed it far more than either of the last two films I went to see, the Pirates of the Caribbean sequel, and Tokyo Drift (ugh).This is for two main reasons: Firstly, the film is awful, and as such it stands out amongst all of the mediocre films made today. It doesn't pretend to be anything more than a horror movie throughout. It's memorable, and at times so predictable and obvious that I laughed out loud.Secondly, unlike Tokyo Drift, this film has not been made to a formula, and churned out by some corporate machine to make a lot of money very quickly. The people who made this film seem to actually care about it, and haven't simply set out to exploit the public.So, much to my own surprise, I'm giving it 7 stars. I don't really know why. Maybe it's because I want to see more movies like it in the cinema.",Snakes on a Plane
1029,warrenparkinson,How's this film getting such a good rating?!,5,2 September 2006,"I was very disappointed with this film. It was a ""fun"" film, but certainly not to be taken in the serious tone that is portrayed.They should have called this film ""bitten genitalia on a plane"" for a start...which makes getting into the experience the passengers are having near on impossible. It's all just too far fetched and unbelievable.I'm glad I used a free cinema voucher I got for my birthday to see this film and didn't pay...I wouldn't have been pleased.Watch this film on DVD with a few mates with beers, but don't expect a serious action film...it's a laugh.",Snakes on a Plane

I never thought it would come, and as it neared I became worried I was hyping it up too much. It could never live up to my expectations. Nonetheless, I went to a midnight showing dressed up in full attire (cardboard ""wings"" with a snake attached). As I sat through preview after preview I became nervous. But as soon as the opening credits rolled, as soon as the first scene came and went, I knew I was seeing something special. The movie went from something to everything I wanted. I don't really know how to word it, but this movie is pure fun from start to finish. Snakes had everything I wanted in it, and then more.",Snakes on a Plane

It's not supposed to make sense or be smart! Well, I'd actually say that about all horror/comedies but... eh.I really don't get why people are so negative. The acting was OK, the plot was fairly good. I suppose the only fake thing was the snakes. Sorry, but I just find them fake. And that big boa? Whoah, don't need a close-up there, y'know what I mean? Overall it's a fun film. Well, as long as you're not watching it with your parents. Find a few friends and go buy a fake snake and take it into the cinema. I assure you it'll be fun. ;D",Snakes on a Plane
1032,A-Clockwork-Critic,I couldn't take my mother f*cking eyes off the mother f*cking screen!,5,21 August 2006,"I forced my friend to see this movie due to the fact he thought it was a waste of time. Halfway into the movie he had transformed from a kid who talks constantly during movies to a droid, eyes focused on the screen. This is exactly what I knew would happen. A movie doesn't need to be professional and have meaning to be a good movie. This movie was just flat-out fun. The humor was great and the characters were awesome. There was the Rap Star 3Gs and his two bodyguards (one of them played by SNL's Kenan Thompson, who ends out playing a major role in the film), there was the rich Paris Hilton type girl named Mercedes who of course was accompanied by a little Chiuhaha named Mary Kate. An annoying ignorant rich Brit, a surfer/stoner guy and his girlfriend (by the way don't get too attached to them), and of course the ""I'm The Frigging Man So Don't Mess With Me"" attitude of Samuel L. Jackson. The snakes were awesome by the way. Biting down on anything that stuck out and when I say anything I mean anything. Let's just say I clutched by manhood in pain while watching a certain scene. When going to see this movie there were two certain things I expected to see. (1)SNAKES and (2)A PLANE. Luckily I got a whole lot more than that in this awesome movie. Overall, this movie will never be described as a great feature film. It will not win any major Oscars, if we're lucky ""Snakes On A Plane (BRING IT)"" will be nominated for best song. This song by Cobra Starship deserves it. This movie will follow in the footsteps of many cult classics and will continue to entertain audience viewers looking for a good time.",Snakes on a Plane
1033,friendsrulezever,"Snakes on a Motha F*cking Plane, Baby",8,17 August 2006,"At 8 pm, I went to see the Descent which is definitely the scariest and goriest movie I've seen in theatres. Loved it.But then at 10, I discovered something even better. A sneak preview of Snakes on a Motha F*cking Plane. Or even better, a sneak preview of Snakes on a Motha F*cking Plane with an auditorium full of superhyped college guys and girls.Let me tell you my experience, and the experience you will likely have when you go see this movie on its opening day.There will be a lot of idiots shouting ""Snakes on a Plane"" or ""Snakes on a Train"" or ""Snakes In the House"" or ""Snakes at Beerfest"" or ""Snakes on a honeymoon"" or just making snake hissing sounds. And you will likely laugh at all those jokes, but you just have to be there.There is a whole lot of cheering and clapping in this movie. The very first cheer is when the great Samuel L. Jackson appears. The next cheer is when Kenan Thompson appears. The next cheer is for one of the pilots who I don't remember the name to right now. It's kinda weird that a theatre mostly full of guys were cheering for all the guys, and not the girls. The best cheer is when the plane actually takes off, and another grand cheer is when we see the snakes, and another grander cheer when the snakes are released They'll also be cheers for the first time Sam whacks a snake, for the first time lesser characters whack the snakes. They'll be uproars for the first casualty...which is tremendously outrageous, not that the other deaths weren't. Uproars for another bathroom scene. Basically, uproars with every gruesome death scene.The biggest cheer is when the infamous quote is finally spoken. It'll be a while into the movie, but when it comes, it'll be so totally worth it.And perhaps the biggest uproar happens near the end of the movie. You will be shocked! I seriously cannot remember a part of the body where the snakes did not attack. Oh my god, there were just not enough body parts for that many snakes.And hell, yes, there's female nudity! (and male half-nekkidness as well) If you went to see this movie expecting great dialogue and acting, you are an idiot! The first few minutes of this movie is excruciatingly bad in every sense, horrible dialogue, flat performances (yes, Sam Jackson sucks when he's not cussing), and the most unbelievable plot in the history of the world. The writers did not put a single ounce of effort in their dialogue because they simply didn't have to, and the actors seemed bored until the real action began.But who in their freaking sober mind care? Once the action starts, it never stops, until the movie ends of course. You'll be jumping out of your seat, you'll be looking away, you'll be gagging, you'll have a freaking blast.High recommendation to see it in the evening (the time that most people will see it), and go ahead and clap and cheer and shout along with the fanatics.Half the fun is actually the audience shouting comments on the screen, and the other half is the freaking movie. So yeah, make sure you go with a lot of peeps, otherwise you'll loose half the fun.P.S. That is not Alicia Silverstone. That's Rachel Blanchard who looks uncannily like her.",Snakes on a Plane
1034,dickgiesser,Amazing!!!!!!,10,26 September 2006,"o-m-f-g!!! this is the most amazing movie in the world. the plot is thick and full of twists and turns, you never know whats coming. The actors are great, SLJ is of course stunning, both in beauty and skill. The snakes are really realistic, and in clears up all the misconceptions about snakes being non-aggressive animals, which they of course are not!! Anyway, if you enjoyed awesome movies like Hostage, Tokyo Drift, Bambi 2 or Best of Faces of Death, then this movie will get your juices flowing. It combines all the premium aspects of those blockbusters in one awesome movie.Please watch it, you wont regret it!",Snakes on a Plane

A must see, take your wife or girlfriend she will squeeze your hand to death. Sam kicks _ss. Movies are made to entertain. This one does it job. Do not listen to those people who are trying spoil this movie. Their just scared to go see it. Horror movie fans, go see Snakes on a Plane. When this movie gets released for DVD, I will be ordering early. Part 2 can't be made on a Plane, whatever the story line is I want to be in it. This is a straight up horror movie.

1036,heyitsshane,samuel l. jackson's willpower was just what we needed,10,28 August 2006,"Okay, here's what I have to contribute to this whole SoaP debate: I loved it. That's not a crime.I do, however, acknowledge that its appeal lies more in the hype than it does in the actual movie. My question is: What's wrong with that? What's wrong with finding something completely ridiculous and inconsequential to believe in? I mean geez, the supercharged energy created by we so-called sheep was more human connection between strangers than I've felt in a long time.I know that there are other great B-movies out there and that there's very little that makes this movie stand out, but there's one aspect of the SoaP phenomenon that everyone seems to be overlooking: Samuel L. Jackson made this happen. One man, with the sheer force of his will, created all of this energy, this bonding, this controversy, and this massive cult following without a deceptive title or a pretentious plot line or any illusion of depth whatsoever. He did it with absolutely nothing. He risked his reputation for a piece of crap and America was more than receptive. This means two things: 1) Samuel L. Jackson has some serious faith and some serious guts and is amazing in general, and 2) America was obviously looking for something, and they found it in Snakes on a Plane.There are so many crises, near-crises, and tragedies going on all around us. Please, even if the shallow commerciality of this movie disgusts you, allow those of us who are receptive to submit to the most over-the-top disaster we can imagine and come out laughing our asses off in the end.",Snakes on a Plane
1037,Silverkid0124,One of the Best Movies I've ever seen,10,19 August 2006,"I came to this movie with some real skepticism. My friends and I agreed that we would see it the day it came out, but when that day finally came, I figured it would be a let down. WOW WAS I WRONG!!! The entire theater gets into the movie, and even though some of the action (not of Samuel L. Jackson) is sketchy, I fully enjoyed the movie. The mix of various reptiles, huge snakes, Samuel L. Jackson, guns, sexual humor, and a very little dog made it bad enough to be funny, but good it enough to be amazing.I have profound respect for this movie, and would be it again in a heartbeat. If you really want to see one of the greatest movies out today, see Snakes on A Plane. DO IT!!! LONG LIVE SoaP !!!",Snakes on a Plane
1038,accountnumber123,Rad,10,18 August 2006,"(Note: I hardly think mentioning a couple of the ways people ""bite it,"" so to speak, count as spoilers, but I suppose some people will want to be surprised at the...well, unsurprising...ways people die in this movie.) It is really a shame to see so much cinematic history forgotten. The movies that today are considered B-movie ""classics"" were (and still are) absolute schlock. They aren't famous and wildly popular because they were -good-...they are famous and wildly popular because they know how to sell themselves. They put things like ""SEE the terror in people's eyes!"" ""SMELL the burning fear!"" on movie posters and have women's barely concealed breasts straining through flimsy dresses. The REAL gems of the genre even went so far as to put little buzzers (The Shocker) under seats in theatres, or pass out barf bags because the movie was ""so gory."" The movies themselves could never compete with the hype surrounding them, but it was hardly the point, was it? So...Snakes on a Plane? It follows in the tradition of these movies. You go in with high hopes that have been created by fantasy and wild, virulent hoo ha marketing ludicrousness. And, if you actually know in your heart that it is ridiculous, you will be able to maintain a suspension of disbelief for long enough to enjoy the hell out of this movie. Snakes bite wieners (""Get off my d*ck, you d*ck!""), plunge themselves into eyeballs, attack wannabe mile-highers, and generally there is lots of screaming, running, turbulence, babies in danger, lightning, and other going-from-bad-to-worse moments of sheer, absurd badness. It delivers everything a movie of this genre is meant to deliver - sensational, salacious entertainment.Truly, what on earth more could you ask?",Snakes on a Plane
1039,icypots,"A great movie, but its one that requires several viewings",10,31 August 2006,"If I would've written a review after the first time I saw this, I probably would've given it a 3 or a 6 out of 10. I have now seen it 7 times, and I can undoubtedly say that this film deserves a 10. Casual moviegoers will dismiss this as just another action movie, but there's detail and second level material here that push it beyond the average.If I had to make a comparison to another film, I would probably say that its most similar to Snakes on a Train.Go see this film a few times. Pay attention to all that you notice during the repeated viewings. You'll be rewarded richly in my opinion. The acting is superb- SLJ steals the show as expected, but nearly everyone was perfectly casted. The writing is tight and on point. The film is sure to become a classic and go down as one of the better action/suspense movies of recent memory.",Snakes on a Plane

It isn't funny or scary, it lacks any good action scenes and the dialog is pathetic. There's no plot to speak of and the ending is as obvious as everything else in the movie. The highlight of the movie is Samuel L. Jackson cursing. Twice. By that time, I kind of sympathized. I would be equally mad if I were to act in such a movie. The only joke is on the viewers who have lost two hours of their lives. It is a pity that the review has to be at least 10 lines, since the above more than covers everything that can be said about the movie.",Snakes on a Plane

What else could you want?,10,2 September 2006,"Sitting in the cinema waiting for Snakes on a Plane i found myself filled with many emotions. excitement, for after 18months of awaiting after hearing on the news of this film, mixed with feelings of dread that it would not live up to the expectations i had of it for they were, i admit, high. Snakes on a Plane blew away any expectations i had of this ""B"" movie into kingdom come, i must say i left the cinema fulfilled and pleased with the outcome.Director David R Ellis takes us on a fantastic journey, with an actually decent storyline of witness protection from a crime lord. No spoiler in saying that snakes are released onto the plane, but once they are you never stop, bang bang bang after wave and wave of attacks. I ended up with stomach cramps from being so tense for so long, and i don't do that often.Sam Jackson is Sam Jackson, and thats why we love him, but i find Nathan Phillips, another son of the soap Neighbours actually doesn't do too bad either. i enjoyed seeing a cast of both new comers, and old timers and i do hope that this film will bring us more from Kenan (and kel)Thompson who brings some nice humour to the plot.Overall i found this film filled with everything, guns, fights, death, sporks, and Sam Jackson with a handmade blowtorch see it!",Snakes on a Plane

It was everything a good action film should be, it had suspense, horror, action and most of all, it never for a moment, took itself seriously.The director was actually very good at poking fun at all of the action film stereotypes. From identifying who was going to die early to the gratuitous nudity, this movie was so funny and so much fun, I cant wait to see it again.Everyone needs to take life a little less seriously, so go see snakes on a plane and smile for a couple of hours.PS Ohh, right on the boob.

The number of snakes surprised me a lot. Its a great date movie, I saw women gripping arms like there was no tomorrow! I was also amused at all of the back plots, like I said It was about ten times better than I ever could have imagined!!..... and last but not least...Samuel L.

It is funny because someone spent all that money for a movie such as this, and you can tell they didn't do it to make a serious thriller or anything. I mean honestly who would make a thriller with someone getting bit in the penis or boob? So for all of you who don't like it, it is because you are trying too hard to want it to be a great action movie, you aren't supposed to spot everything bad and call it a crappy movie, it is great for it's corniness and it has Samuel L.

1045,roddystewart,Roll On Snakes On An Ambulance!,10,19 August 2006,"Decades from now how will history view Snakes on a Plane? The first film in which the audience got a voice, the definitive B-movie involving small reptiles on mass transport systems...or perhaps that mediocre movie starring the black guy from Pulp Fiction? Well, to be honest I couldn't care less how history judges this film, Snakes on a Planes was never designed for the ages, or hell to be a good film. It was a designed to be a blast, and with a name like Snakes on a Plane how could it not be. I can honestly say this is the most fun I've ever had in the cinema.Going into our local cinema I was nervous...could this movie, garnered with months of hype ever truly live up to it's promising potential and as the film started, going into it's first twenty-five minutes I began to get even more worried, there were no snakes, no Sam Jackson, just surfers and mob hit men. Yes! Odily enough there is some build up for *shock plot details (But these are quickly filtered out as soon as the snakes go crazy. But slowly and surely as the characters begin to arrive at the airport the film builds momentum, and when the plane takes off that's when the fun really begins! About half an hour in we get our first kill and with the sight of a venomous snake biting down on some naked boobies all traces of doubt are blown away, along with the logic and sense (but really does anyone care). And for the next hour we're treated to some of the most fun, gory, intense, hilarious and brilliant scenes since that shot of the train hurtling towards the camera in the early 20th century. But Snakes on a Plane is more than just a movie, yeah sure you could watch it alone at home and still enjoy the film but you'd be missing out on the thing that makes this movie so special, the fact that everyone around you is having the time of their lives that something magical happens. Audience participation, watch and marvel as the audience literally cheers, screams and jokes with the film (''Someone get Steve Irwin!'').What makes this film a perfect 10, is not the snakes on the plane, the thrill factor or Sam Jackson (he'll have to settle for second place). It's the fact that the film decides it is what it is, grabs the ball and runs to the end zone, and because of that it makes the perfect night of group entertainment...and in years the best drinking game since Withnail & I! (Drink for the anaconda!)(Wow, I managed to get through that without saying ''I've had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane...damn!)",Snakes on a Plane

Snakes on a plane, you can just imagine the writer who came up with that.Well the film follows through on its originality as seen in the title with many obvious, continuous snake attacks. Its pretty much cheesy throughout the whole film with really bad scripting. Nothing special to add about the acting, especially Samuel L. Jackson who lowered his credibility greatly from staring in this, mainly because it such a terrible script. This is cause the movie is pretty much completely on the plane, and as it is sitting on a plane, there is not much to do. As for most of the scenes on the plane, the average 10 year old could write out where snakes could come out from of a plane, as well as places in which a snake could bite a person and it would not be far from this film.But if your into a very simple, quite stupid and ridiculously funny movies, which are easy to watch, go right ahead and dumb yourself down for 2 hours.peace!",Snakes on a Plane

There is blood and gore and amazing suspense mixed with great satirical dialog.If you want a movie that develops a plot where there's a thick mystery or sweet love story or fantastical beasts, don't see this movie. If you want to be 100% completely entertained for an hour and a half, SEE THIS MOVIE!!

Samuel L. provided the performance of his life you simply have to see the movie to believe it. At some parts I cried of laughter, it was like an ""Almighty Lol"". During some more serious scenes, I cried of sadness. This movie profoundly touched me.

He plays his part so seriously that you can't help but cheer him on. Also, you don't have to think when watching this movie. Sometimes you cheer for the snakes.. and sometimes you fear them. The same goes for many of the characters in the movie; Sometimes you fear for the life of a character.. and sometimes you want them to die a violent death.
