0,Leofwine_draca,Before Squid Game...,6,5 November 2021,"Something very different from the creator of SQUID GAME, but no less hard hitting. Tough to enjoy this one, as it's a true story detailing child rape and other abuse in a school for the deaf, but it's undeniably engrossing and very well made, just as you'd expect from Korea. Gong Yoo holds together an extraordinary ensemble cast, and in particular the child actors go above and beyond here. Like SPOTLIGHT, it's a story that needs to be heard.",Silenced
1,paulclaassen,Definitely not for children!,6,19 June 2019,"Wow, what a well made and disturbing film. The film sends a very powerful message and also effectively illustrates manipulation, bribery, and abuse of power, believing money can right all wrongs.Although the film is a bit slow moving, it was never boring. I did, however, find the protagonist Kang In-ho (Yoo Gong) a bit too passive. Seo Yoo-jin was a much stronger character, portrayed by Yu-mi Jung - who did a very good job. The child actors were also good and I enjoyed their back stories, as well. The film is sexually graphic at times (involving children) and definitely not suitable for a young audience.Based on fact, this is a very disturbing film and the reality of the case is cringe worthy. At the time the film was made, the actual case was still in progress, so the true fate of all involved is not exactly known. As it is, this was not the ending I expected.",Silenced
2,SAMTHEBESTEST,Another heart-wrenching and disturbing classic with Korean Realism. It proves again that Law & Justice is nothing but a big joke in real life.,8,4 July 2021,"Do-ga-ni / Silenced (2013) :
Brief Review -Another heart-wrenching and disturbing classic with Korean Realism. It proves again that Law & Justice is nothing but a big joke in real life. Based on real events, Silence depicts the story of a school for the hearing-impaired where young deaf students girls and boys both were sexually assaulted by the faculty members over a long period of time. Don't tell me that reading this don't leave your mind disturbed. I have always admired the level of Brutalism and Realism in Korean films but earlier most of the times it was about thriller and revenge dramas. Now, I admire Korean Realism for showing the Cruel and brutal true events happened in the society and how helpless victims can be. You know i sometimes believe that this Law & Justice looks effective and useful only in reel world. Just like any fictional piece of writing, cops and court would do correct justice. But in real life it doesn't happen like that and this film proves it. Not just this, i have seen two more films just recently to prove it. 'Miracle In Cell No. 7', 'Hope' and now this 'Silenced' have convinced me to believe so. In all three films we see the wrong side of Law & Justice and we hate it like anything. Silenced is more brutal because it shows the cruelty against children, not adults. This was before Hollywood made Oscar Winning 'Spotlight' (2015), a film based on sensitive and taboo subject like spiritual abuse. Here, it was child abuse with more cruelty and few unbearable visuals. The film breaks the silence on one of the most serious crime ever done in the society but the punishment for it is not at all acceptable. Acting, writing, screenplay, background score, cinematography, dialogues and direction everything about this film is perfect. Overall, another mind-shattering Classic with uncompromised cinematic vision.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",Silenced
3,Foutainoflife,What Is Wrong With People?!,8,1 November 2021,"Let me just say that while watching this, I would've happily given up my front row seat in Hell to have been there when these innocent children were being so viciously abused. Wigs would've be snatched and grills thoroughly cleaned!The utter cruelty, entitlement and depravity of these individuals is absolutely unforgivable. The people who let them get away with it are just as disgusting for sacrificing justice for the victims for their own personal gain.It's a good movie that you are going to hate watching.",Silenced

6,Prashast_Singh,"Silenced Review: Left me silent, thinking, and sad for long.",10,2 June 2017,"Movie: Silenced (18)Rating: 4.75/5If you're into watching realistic movies, then you're bound to like it. SILENCED/THE CRUCIBLE is an effective & realistic drama feature that appeals because of the sincerity towards the film by its actors and the justice done to the script by the director. Such strong content- oriented films can definitely change the society and it's not a spoiler, it did. To find out more, search about it on Internet. SILENCED is by no means an ordinary film: it's a film which questions South Korean society, as well as the people of the world as humans, too.I don't think it would be right to tell what the film is about since that can be found out easily. But, wait. Why don't you simply see the film and recommend it to others? This is a realistic film, and the word is enough for you to understand what kind of a film it is. The topic is what is being commonly raised in our Indian movies too, but from a totally different perspective. I think this is the first of its kind. The film is made in a way that you'll end up rooting for the lead characters, their efforts and the young victims. I was indeed shocked to see how far can the devilish nature of humans go. Some scenes, rather many scenes might be, by no means an easy watch. But I support the director's reason for adding these realistic scenes: to make us feel angry, and I not just felt angry, but also happy that he succeeded in making us emote.SILENCED is a film which can end up raising hot debates and talks, and it would be a surprise if one doesn't end up liking the film. The film is a perfect example of films that can change the society, the country and eventually, the world. Even though I'm not a South Korean, I ended up liking this film very much. What happens in this film happens in India almost daily, but still it was refreshing to see such a realistic film from South Korea, the country from where we get terrific films everywhere.Technically too, this film is brilliant. I recommend catching it on Blu- ray. The dialogues are powerful. Gong Yoo once again proves himself and I don't need to say why. Jung Yu-mi is not just pretty, but a talented actress too. You can see it from her performance. The child artists surprise you with their acts, since you don't expect kids normally to do such a dark film. They all give terrific performances, eventually making you feel their pain. The pain in the torturous violence can be felt, and is thus not meant to entertain you. The cinematography is excellent. Visuals are excellent. The music supports the film and the editing is great as the film doesn't bore you for even a second. SILENCED is a very, very powerful film which deserves to be seen. Sadly I can't recommend it for kids, since they would be saddened but I recommend it to people around 15 and above to watch it. Such films don't intend to entertain you only, but also to make you aware and alert. It won't be right to call it an enjoyable film, but it's definitely thought-provoking, and at times, entertaining too.",Silenced
7,socrates4,Great Korean Film,8,17 May 2019,"SILENCED tells the shocking true story of students at a school for the deaf and the abuse they endured there, as well as its aftermath. The film unfolds in a perfect way and leaves the viewer constantly on the edge of their seat.Part of what makes this film so good is the fact that it's a true story. I'm sure that certain events were probably changed for the sake of structure and flow, but that doesn't make it any less believable. Highly recommend.",Silenced
8,aminifatimaaa,a harrowing and emotionally exhausting movie,10,25 March 2019,"Silenced is a mixing pot of emotions; one full of hope, resentment, depression but ultimately injustice. There are many films made to impress viewers but this one is among the few, not just to impress you, but to deeply disturb you. It makes you crave for nothing but human dignity and fairness. The film had me stunned with astonishing performances especially the three brilliant child actors who perfectly portrayed their characters. Silenced is a bold piece of modern Korean cinema that should be seen by everyone.",Silenced
9,anthonyjlangford,Misery Market,7,31 August 2020,"A well made film, not for the squeamish and difficult to watch. A harrowing true story with some sad insights into the archaic Korean justice system. I sincerely hope things have changed since the events in this story took place.My problem with the film is it makes obvious and elongated efforts to drag out the misery. Cheesy music plays and characters move in slow motion. The events are already horrible. Dressing it up in such a fashion is effective at times, but over the top and a little corny for the most part. It devalues the story. Oscar worthy, it is not.There is also little let up. It's wall to wall misery.
A well made film, worth watching for its content, if you don't mind the obvious attempts to stretch out the pain, as if there wasn't enough already.",Silenced
10,ajit2106,One of the most potent film ever seen.,8,25 June 2012,"""Silenced..."" as the title suggests, is a powerful film about a mute and deaf school in Gwangju (South Korea).In 2005 Kang In-ho arrives at a school where children are deaf, but quickly realizes that something is wrong, as children were cloistered in a kind of autism. The reason is simple; they are suffering from pain through twin-principals and other teachers. Kang In-ho, first was blind towards the horrible acts, however, he wakes up very quickly and puts his life in the background to devote him entirely to these children in the deepest distress.Written and directed by filmmaker Dong-hyuk Hwang, who runs his second coil after My Father (2007), based on the novel by Jee-young Cong taking Novel in one hand and camera in the other, Hwang Dong-hyuk takes us into a hell where cruelty is watchword. Men who abuse children are already a disgrace, but when equipped with a handicap that prevents them to express them while we pass this stage to speak only to be demonic. Moreover, work is in addition to killing these demons, exposing South Korea where levels of justice are rotten to the point that despite overwhelming evidence, everyone comes out innocent or at worst a slight slap on the wrist. Such injustice deserved to talk about it, and if the literature does not always express them on a large scale, the cinema can more easily, and in 2011 the film has been a blow, pushing the government to close the school and start a new trial.Hwang Dong-hyuk, who directs his cast with strength and power, conveys a strong message with an eye opener. We can feel the players involved, everyone is in the place and nobody is ever too much, especially children, crying for truth, despite their silence, but the look says a lot about the work of management. No melodramatic pathos, not only the accuracy enhanced by fluid narration and exciting, equally divided between face to face with the horror and the trial, or rather mock trial. The director also quite unsettling talent to film scenes touching, working the image at the point of giving an atmosphere of morbid poetry returning the stomach (although almost everything is hidden), to the Unlike scenes about bullying that they go into bestiality at the lowest.Silenced is a work that takes you to the gut, but also a masterpiece at all levels, sad, very sad, because during filming (like writing a book) hopelessness was most certainly in the spirit all, nobody is expecting that the film can shake rotten legal foundation at this point to the bone. The arrival of this film is welcome, but it remains a work paradoxically awful cinematic should play a social role, rape, torture, and death stories of children who have so far had very little impact. We think Hwang Dong-hyuk has done considerable work, but we also think these children whose childhood or life, were stolen. The story is very centered and never leaves its intention, as I said earlier it is based on the true story, we can feel the sufferings of the characters.This is a take on the human with animal instinct and the actions will shake the base of humanity.Recommended to everyone who can digest the kinky truth.9/10",Silenced
11,cremea,"Type of movie that will make you sick, but, you have to watch anyway!.",8,15 September 2012,"Silenced (aka the Crucible) is a 2011 South Korean film that is not really an easy watch. It's quite good for the most part, but it will leave a bad taste in your mouth for sure. I do recommend watching it, but with the caveat that it will pretty much spoil your evening afterwards. So, you've been warned!SPOILERS AHEAD!I have a number of general rules that I try to live by, which allow me to go about my life in a civilized society with a clear conscience. These rules include simple mundane courtesies like saying thank you or opening the door for little old ladies or not flipping the bird to that idiot who doesn't know how to drive, to more serious matters like not disrupting someone else's marriage or abusing animals for kicks or cheating someone out of their life savings (which would, incidentally, be quite easy to do in my line of work). My list of rules escalate to not hurting people, but the list has always topped out with the following: DO NOT PHYSICALLY, MENTALLY, OR SEXUALLY ABUSE CHILDREN!If you don't know already, this movie is all about breaking my ""golden rule"" stated above. A school chock full of deviant teachers, principals, and employees, which has been systematically and repeatedly raping, beating, and torturing the child students there on a wide scale. To make matters worse (if that's possible), is the fact that this is a school for the deaf & mute, and that many of these children are from broken homes, are orphaned, poor, etc. To top it off, this movie is based on a true story (a thought, which frankly, I could not get out of my head while watching the thing). Now, I'm not privy as to what was depicted in the movie is actually factual, or what amount of dramatic license was invoked, or what have you. But even if the tiniest bit of any of this is even remotely true, the, I am utterly disgusted. Sadly however, I am no longer surprised by hearing stories like this in the world I live in.As for the movie itself, it basically revolves around a new teacher who comes to the school and soon uncovers the abuses within. He and a human rights activist he gets to know begin to work to help the children in harm's way, and to punish those involved with the crimes. It's a straight up drama story line and courtroom procedural for the most part. There's little to no action or vengeance involved, and it's not anywhere near as graphic as it might have been (considering the subject matter) if this were part of some other type of film genre.Production, pacing, and story are all solid enough. Acting is pretty strong throughout (particularly from the children, which had to be bit uncomfortable, performance wise, for them). There's a side story involving the new teacher's child, which quickly takes a back seat to the primary plot point, along with the hinting of a budding relationship between said teacher and the activist. Aside from that, this film focuses almost exclusively on the evil deed at hand, what will be done about it once uncovered, and what efforts the community will go to in order to just make this all go away as quickly & quietly as possible. Oh, and this IS a Korean production, so (SUPER SPOILERS), you might not want to get your hopes up for the happiest of endings. Bottom line: It's in the 7-8 out of 10 stars range for me. I'll give it an 8, because it is stuck in my brain (at least for now) after watching it, and it was well done overall. And, after all, isn't that what watching cinema is all about?...If you want any type of a remotely ""feel good/good time flick"", watch something else!...but, if you're in the right mood to watch a solid and effecting drama about a sad and horrible topic, than this film comes fairly well recommended by yours truly!",Silenced
12,TheDyingGirl,I am fuming!!,9,28 October 2019,To think this actually happened in real life makes me so mad. South Korea really needs to have harsher laws against sexual abuse. Even today they still have a long way to go .,Silenced
13,w-71474,In order not to let the world change us,9,13 April 2020,"The film is adapted from real events.
Through the dark and long tunnel, it is Wujin. The thick fog of the sky, two of the lives that had just been lost, the body still warm, and the green traffic sign, silently told Jiang Renhao: Wujin welcomes you.
Maybe every life should be equal in this world. Now it seems that people have reached a certain consensus, that is, a sentence that seems to be carved on the dust in the everlasting universe: all men are created equal. But the ironic meaning of reality may lie here. It constantly and vaguely tells us that people are born unequal.Any kind of favor that the strong shows to the weak is magnified indefinitely, so that it can even become a testimony to defend the crime of the strong. Reality keeps us full of hope, but this hope has been reduced to nothing again and again. Reality teaches us to forgive again and again, perhaps because some people have not yet seen true despair.Three born or acquired children with some kind of physical weakness and two adults with a sense of justice struck up the whole story. The film is a story about justice and evil wrestling. A perverted scum of a child who sexually assaults, with a well-dressed face and a straight face. The portrait even more justice than the real person hangs in the office, one can not help but sigh that the charm of art is so breathtaking. These people, superficially, excellent people, people with heads and faces, have countless titles and countless accomplishments: philanthropists, educators, Christian church members, teachers. But their hearts have long been corroded and cleaned, and perhaps even the dirtiest maggots do not bother to live on such a skin. And there are others who act as the minions of these people: guards, police, officials of the Department of Education, officials of the City Hall, doctors of the hospital, judges, defense lawyers. This makes us deeply feel that people want to have power and people want to have money, otherwise, everything they encounter may just be deserved.But maybe we forgot a word called innocent. This word has not disappeared after the weak came into the world. And behind it is always a word that is quite indifferent but actually shocking: victim. The children in the film, they are innocent, they came to this world with goodwill, and came to this world with crippled giving, they lived, just lived, they did not hate the world, nor did they expect everything. However, fate is often given very little, but much is sought. Even a smile has become a distressing luxury.Maybe you and I are like Mr. Jiang Renhao, busy every day in the streets and alleys, dragging our tired bodies on the crowded subway, so ordinary, but with such a beautiful dream. When Mr. Jiang Renhao was holding a birthday cake and staring at the billboard for a long time, maybe he remembered everything he had experienced in that misty city, maybe he remembered everything in the world, maybe he remembered the dead child, yet There are children who continue to live. All of this, like a dream, roared through his mind. In the end, his eyes slowly stretched straight toward the world in the painting. In the painting, some distance, there was a dream he wanted to achieve but did not achieve.",Silenced

I am a new found fan of Gong Yoo (Goblin) and find his performances in most of his movies to be outstanding and memorable. He did not disappoint me when I finally purchased a copy of Silenced (2011) since it isn't available in the USA online or even through Raukuten/Viki network. This film is a fictionalized version of an actual ongoing tragedy that took place at a school for Deaf children in South Korean.
Without revealing too much about the story, let it be said that the gross indifference, coverup, hypocrisy, and injustice portrayed in the film will move you to tears and then to anger. The stellar performances by Gong Yoo, Jung Yu Mi, and the child actors will linger in your mind long after the movie credits fade from your screen.

23,ken1848,Move Thee Reviews: Sunny Days Are Rare in the City of Mist,10,24 June 2012,"Sunny and Silenced are two Korean films I have watched in 2012 and both are excellent. Silenced is a poignant and depressing movie based on a true event that happened in a special school where the deaf children are abused by the Principal and teachers. In the first half of the movie, the horrible abuses are unveiled one by one. The second half is a courtroom drama.The movie is an emotional ride which tugs at your heartstrings. At the scene in which the teacher is on the verge of tears and the boy cries his eyes out and struggles to express his overwhelming pent-up emotions upon knowing that his grandmother has forgiven the culprit, some members of the audience will be moved to tears. Where might is master, justice is servant, which is cruel, but real. It is also uplifting to see the teacher remain steadfast in his determination to bring the culprits to justice, despite his daughter's plight.As for the setting, the misty mountains and creepy campus create an eerie atmosphere. I also love the montage at the beginning of the movie. The kid is just like the deer, innocent and pure.The perversion of justice prevails when Christians are blinded by their unquestionable faith, teachers are heartless, policemen, lawyers, the judge and the security guard are corrupted by money, civil servants shirk their responsibility and shift the work onto others and others remain silent. Martin Luther King is right. In the end, we remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends. Amid those humans who are evil but influential in society, justice is shrouded in a thick gray mist.",Silenced
24,forlornnesssickness,"Silenced : It was very, very unfair to these molested kids",9,14 June 2014,"What happened to the kids is something you hear from the media with disbelieving eyes. We usually ask ourselves; how could the people commit such horrible deeds? Can that really happen in our society? Though the movie is the fiction based on the bestseller novel written by Gong Jee- young, the novel itself was based on the real-life incident reported by the South Korean media in 2005. As depicted in the movie, it drew lots of attention from the people at that time, and there was the trial for this heinous crime later – but that was not the end of the story and there are still scars remained.When we meet In-ho(Gong Yoo) for the first time, he is coming to the local area named Mujin as the new art teacher of the boarding school for the deaf students. While his daughter is taken care of by his mother in Seoul(his wife was dead), he lives alone in some shabby apartment. He does not particularly like his new job, but he needs a job for earning the money for his sick daughter. When the principle and the administration supervisor, the principle's twin brother(both are played by Jang Gwang), demand In-ho to pay the considerable amount of money as the contribution for ""school development fund"" on his first day, he accepts their demand without question. It is not right thing to do, but he has no choice if he wants to keep his job.However, it turns out that is not the only thing he has to deal with while working at this school. He sees one of the teachers savagely beating one of his students in the teachers' office while other teachers ignore the abuse being committed right in front of them. At one night, he hears a strange sound from the ladies' room when he is about to leave. He tries to find out who is behind the bathroom door, but he is soon interrupted by the night guard, who assures him that nothing happens. Later, he witnesses the other teacher abusing the other student with the washing machine at the basement – while the washing machine is turned on.If you have some knowledge about the South Korean society, you will probably have some good idea about what will happen next. In-ho and Yu- jin want these disgusting people to be arrested, but, as shown in his expensive office, the principle is a well-respected member of the local society. He is also an elder of the local church(that means we will see some unpleasant side of Korean Christians), and he has some powerful connections to the local authorities. On the day when he comes to the office for the giving the money for the school development fund, In-ho happens to see a local cop stopping by the school for his money. Even when they try to report this crime to the other local government officials, they ignore them with bureaucratic indifference while saying it is not their job due to the jurisdiction rule.Eventually, after the kids' story goes out on TV, the principle and others are quickly arrested and the trial soon follows, but In-ho and Yu-jin find themselves more helpless as the time goes by. The kids are willing to testify what happened to them, and there are some evidences to support their testimonies, but it is possible that their abusers will not be properly punished in the end. The counsel for the accused, a former law official, is well-connected to judges and prosecutors; as a custom inside the South Korean justice system, they give some advantages to him because it is his first trial after leaving his office. The kids' parents are poor or disabled, so they can be easily persuaded to withdraw the suit on the behalf of their children. They even approach to In-ho, who has been in financially difficult situation.The director Hwang Dong-hyeock wisely does not hurry his story. While providing the good atmosphere with the hazy fog covering the town, he effectively conveys the frustration inside the story. Though his character is rather bland and passive, Gong Yoo does a passable job as an ordinary man who tries to do the right thing while knowing that there is little he can do for the abused kids. Jeong Yu-mi is trapped in her flat character who mostly functions as the mouthpiece of the story, but she does as much as she can.The movie is not free from its flaws. Despite its good intention, it sometimes stumbles with a heavy-handed approach. While the villains are played effectively by good actors, they are just mean and despicable in one-dimensional way. They seem to come from the other movie whenever confronting the other characters. The court scenes have some awkwardness although it is less stiff than other South Korean movies featuring the court scenes. The finale is overlong and a little too melodramatic while emphasizing the characters' bitterness they have to face at the end of their struggle.Nevertheless, ""Silenced"" has enough power to draw you into its anger, and you will identify with its indignation toward the unfairness in South Korean society. As reflected in the epilogue in the movie, the abusers were only sentenced to light punishment, and they did not even go to the jail. How could they let that happen? Will such a horrible thing happen again? Sad thing is, it is really hard for us to prevent the world from changing ourselves, let alone change the world.",Silenced

I think those reasons are enough to make people shed a tear, if not probably you are an asshole (like me in real life :P).Once I finished the movie, I felt sad, enrage, and little bit disappointed because there is no justice in the movie (well, what do you expect it's based on real life). Then I realized how powerful this movie is... and yeah, this movie sparked rage in South Korea public. The public there demanded that this case should be re-open. After this movie the Education ministry demanded more detailed profile and criminal record from every teachers, and they have shut down Inhwa School. The government passed Dogani law (named after this movie). Even the president of South Korea made a comment and stand with public opinion.For a movie to give such a big impact in a nation is pretty impressive.

All the horrible things in this movie did happen, probably worse, and only the tip of the iceberg for what happens in the real world.As for the review of the movie, it is a bit slow at the beginning. A lot of silence moments, but that's usual in a drama movie, right?
But the story is gripping and well-written, the acting is convincing and captivating, i even find it uncomfortable seeing the child actors to play such harrowing graphic scenes that makes me worried about the children's mental health.
The lead male character, named In-ho, makes me a bit upset because he's being so passive (and stupid!), even when he sees his coworker beats a child terribly. Probably to bond the viewer's emotion, to make the viewer upset and finally feel the satisfaction of releasing rage when In-ho hits one of the molester and sues them. And there is where the real struggle begins.
There are some missing plots, but probably cut because the movie will be very long if it isn't, but don't worry, it will be explained in the end.
The movie contains a lot of shocking scenes that shiver me to the spine and breaks me to tears.The sad truth is the world is full with corrupted law enforcers, and this movie describes it very clearly that justice only happened for rich people, and we live in a cruel and filth world like that.",Silenced

I am not reviewing the film as such but HK the blue ray release.I watched the original (Englush subbed) on TUBI TV and wanted a version that had the subbed lyrics of the song in the movie, A Thorn Tree.The blue ray did have the translated lyrics but I noticed that a few scenes were cut from the film.Not that I am a fan of graphic scenes of child abuse, but I felt that this movie needed those horrific scenes to make the viewer uncomfortably horrified as well.My main issue is WHY did they cut out those scenes when it seems it was all right for American viewers to see them?I did find a DVD copy with those scenes intact, but no song lyrics..

29,adriano-40012,This movie screams for justice 10/10,10,7 November 2021,"I'm sitting here right now at 4am thinking about the movie and what I've witnessed. This is the first time I cried during watching a movie. It felt so emotional and personal to me. I literally soaked the pain of the victims through my heart.PlotThe action revolves around a young teacher who got a job in a school for hearing impaired children. For this he had to come from Seoul to a fictional city called Mujin. Once there, you feel slight signs of strangeness in relation to the other teachers, staff and headmasters of the academic school. I was also startled about the behavior of the kids in school. I knew they were hearing impaired, but my human instinct instantly told me something is not right here.I won't spoil and go much into detail about the plot. My advise is if you like drama movies or even experienced injustice in life you'll more to the movie. Even though you didn't experienced anything like that, you should watch this movie if you have the nerves for it.VisualsThe visuals were so real. Incredible camera work and great cuts. The scenarios were also well lighted and in appropriate moments, set darker and gloomy. Not darker in the sense of thriller or horror, but in the sense of dramatology. Hats off to the camera team, because I paused the movie when I shook up a drink just to miss not a split second.ActingGong Yoo became one of my favorite actors right now. Not one of my Korean favorite actors, I really mean overall one of my favorite actors. He delivered an outstanding performance. You can really tell the movie touched him in some way. Also credits to the kids they were so emotional and authentic. The kid actors mastered the sign language just like adults. The kids definitely made me feel like they were in real life disabled. I don't know if they really are, hopefully not. This reminds me on the actor in Breaking Bad who played Walter White's son he had the disability in reality, but was almost healthy. He was able to perform that disability of not walking straight and believable.What I missed was more interactions between Gong Yoo & Seo Yoo-jin. Don't get me wrong they had interactions and I'm not aware how much of that was fictional. At least they didn't create a love romance, which would've taken the focus away from the actual plot. Thumbs up to the authors they did know how to write a script for that real life story.Gong Yoo's and Seo Yoo-jin's character both develop during the movie in way you wouldn't have expect that specially from Seo Yoo-jin.Overall to the actors I can't say I felt like one of them was out of place except for the caretaker maybe.DirectorI had this movie for 2 years in my watch list and I just found out it is the same director from Squid Game. He also wrote the story. His casting choice was well chosen. The accusers, the victims, the people from human rights, the teachers and even the police guy. All of them played their roles so good you either sympathize with them or hate them, which makes good acting worthy.ConclusionThis movie needs more attention and screams for justice. I wrote this review for almost 45 minutes. Drama will always be my first movie addiction. I'm always looking for a movie I've never seen one like that before. It's an unique gem and based on true events unfortunately... The message is we all have struggles and issues in life, but we should be grateful what God gave us and use our voice to help the voiceless people. The voiceless people needs support, love, safety and home.Thank you for reading till the end and English is not my native language.

The cinematography/atmosphere and the music are superb.This movie really made me sad and angry at the world at the same time. At some points in the movie i wished i could be there and take a gun and take justice in to my own hands.It portraits the true nature of how evil and disgusting human beings can be. The sheer fact that the system and those who ""abide"" the law are corrupt, and still manage not to give a damn about what happened to those children, is beyond my understanding.The movie got me frustrated at many points and i just wanted to punch the protagonist in the face for not taking justice in to his own hands. You see evil in front of you and you see that the majority of the people running the system, the laws are bad and corrupt, and you think by yourself, why not punish all those evil bastards? and i don't care how it is done, as long as they get punished.At some point one gets the realization that there is no hope in this world. Our society is run by sociopaths and psychopaths. It shows that money can do anything, and that human life and a child's innocence means nothing to those in power.

32,rpannier,Maybe the Best Movie I have Seen - From Any Country,10,3 October 2011,"Gang In-ho takes a job working at a school for the hearing impaired in Gwangju. The movie opens with him driving to the school (and having an accident) about the same time as a young boy from the school commits suicide by walking in front of a train. From almost the beginning of his time at the school, he notices that something seems out of kilter. The school seems almost dark and unfeeling. The students not particularly friendly and one teacher is just damned mean. The movie focuses on two sisters, one of whom is especially stand-offish and the other, unfriendly and with issues about eating and their brother who seems to be bloodied and bruised worse every time he comes to class. We eventually learn that the two girls are being abused physically and sexually by the Principal and the Asst Principal with the knowledge of one female teacher, the security guard, a local police officer and at least one staff member (who is abusing the boy both physically and sexually) The teacher enlists the help of Seo Yu-jin, a human rights activist to help the children (and him) Initially they find little support for their cause. The police are totally disinterested in what Yu-jin tells them. Partially because here in Korea making the establishment look bad is not something people do readily and partially because the police officer is a fairly high ranking figure within the department. Finally, they turn to YTN News. And a reporter does an interview with the children that is seen on TV throughout Korea. The police reluctantly spring into action and arrest the principal, asst principal and the teacher -- no one else. The movie then moves onto the second trial. The children are 'raped' again, this time by members of the establishment. The Superintendent for Public Instruction and the defense lawyer try to bribe the teacher into ending the case. When he refuses, they pay off the aged and mentally feeble grandmother of the children. The local evangelical community rallies to the defense of the principal. The prosecutor seems to be on the side of justice, but in the end, it appears he left the children hanging out to dry. The movie is extremely graphic and painful. The rape scenes are not glossed over and the physical abuse of the oldest brother is difficult to watch. But more painful, is the end of the trial where the audience is left frustrated, angry and saddened by the way these three children (and their dead brother) are left with nothing even remotely resembling justice. What makes this hard to take is that, while the movie is based on the events, the events still happened and they were as horrid as the movie describes. And were it not for the book and this movie some of these people would have continued with their lives as if nothing had happened. A definite 10.",Silenced

It's almost astonishing to know that due to this movie, they reopened the case and passed the ""Dogani Law"" reinforcing harsh punishments for the offenders.The movie displays the horrors in the most truest way possible. The script, each dialogue plays with your emotions like never before. And to know that this was based on a true incident makes it even more chilling to know how cruel certain people can be and to what extent they would go to try to save themselves. It was quite emotional for me and it will definitely make me see the world through another lens, to be more vigilant and kind because I somehow connect with the characters if the storyline connects to mine. This movie was beautiful not in the way they portray the abuse, but to show how the children can overcome such horror and that there are a few people who would give their lives to fight for justice.The movie ends with a beautiful quote where Seo Yoo-jin says that ""we fight not to change the world but to not let the world change you"" and I think that's gonna resonate with me for quite a while.",Silenced

I took three breaks ofc. Getting to know these true accounts I always think why is the world so cruel to kids. And to some people whatever's the age. Tears are up in my eyes, while writing this. How can people do this to kids? They're harmless and in this case they are hard of hearing persons.While tears in my eyes for the second time I kept a mental note to start being kind to people. Whatever they do, whoever they are, however they behave. Just today I got to see a quote, I get a quote everyday morning at 8, so today's was ""kindness is invincible"". At the end of the film the human rights worker in a letter to the art teacher, says that 'I asked the girls what's the difference you are seeing before the court case and after the case?'
You know what they said? 'They realised they're precious like everyone else.'

I had to finish it. I needed a dose of reality to be reminded of how this world worked again. If this wasn't based on a true story it most probably wouldn't hurt me that much but the thing is; it really did happen. Real children had to go through a hell like that, they cried, they screamed, their hearts struck by anguish, they were miserable and yet nobody listened to them, the people who tortured them never got what they deserved. It happened. This happened. And it rips my heart apart. Most of the time I was either crying or screaming at the screen wishing I had some magical hands that could penetrate it to grab those monsters; not that that would be helpful or anything but I just had this tremendous urge to just hurt those people (not the actors obviously). But anyways, the movie ended and a part of me just died with that kid who had to strive for justice and avenge brother on his own.

As it were, the polished manner in which director-screenwriter Hwang Dong-hyuk adopts mainstream genre conventions to develop ambiance, suspense, and calculated twists propel the story to an incendiary and compelling conclusion. Although the film ultimately achieves its function to expose deep-rooted and far-reaching social injustice, its visceral representation of harrowing and morally repugnant scenes remains unnerving and questionable. But the film belongs to the child actors, who transcend the controversial subject by conveying such a complex combination of pain, confusion and resilience one instantly roots for them.

Didn't really know what to expect from the film before going in, but came out shaken, angered and left with the feeling of having seen a powerful film that can bring about positive change. The basis for the movie is purported to be based on a true story which makes things all the more striking. Having not watched ""Children..."" a Korean movie that came out earlier this year also based on a true story, my closest point of reference is Bong Joon-Ho's by now classic film ""Memories of Murder"". ""Silenced"" doesn't possess the master of cinema feel that ""Memories of Murder"" has, nor does it have the first mover advantage in its story, but ""Silenced"" is able to deliver the same (if not more) type of jolt to the viewer which is really saying something. Some criticism I had for the film were 2 scenes felt just too graphic and a few other times the movie seemed to carry a far too simpleton feel, but in hindsight I'm guessing both of these points originated from the filmmaker's desire to have maximum impact with the largest group possible. In that case, the filmmaker got his wish. While walking out of the theater I did feel energized from having watched something so moving and also filled with fear & anger at just how wicked some parts of society can become. Performance wise, I thought Gong Yoo was good and Jung Yu-Mi was her usual great self. There was a final scene with Gong Yoo holding a bible in the middle of the street that didn't move me as much as I thought the scene wanted. Maybe I was just too exhausted from having witnessed humanity at its darkest hour prior to that. The movie also featured large amounts of court-room drama in the second half which I really enjoyed. ""Silenced"" has already brought in a lot of people into the theaters in South Korea and also opened a lot of eyes to the injustices that occurred in South Korea just a few years ago (2005).

Bong Joon-ho's Memories of murder and Mother are few examples of great story telling of Korean movies. Another great example in this league is Dong-hyuk Hwang's Silenced.
I watched this movie yesterday and here is my opinion about this excellent movie.Story: The movie starts with arrival of a newly hired teacher in a special school for specially abled (deaf) children and suicide of a little boy.
As the story progresses, it reveals the horror the children go through in that hostel. The story is superbly written and takes you to a highly emotional ride.Screenplay: Screenplay is very tight and never bores. It is magnificently written that takes the movie forward very smoothly.Performance: Yoo Gong played his character very well. However, if we talk about the elephant in the room, it is the group of children. They gave a powerful performance that will compel you to think about their plight.Direction: The movie is very well directed. He has been successful in taking performance from the whole cast.

Gong Yoo read the novel The Crucible/Silenced (Dogani, 2009) while serving his mandatory military service and became involved in the film making. The child actors were amazing. Because they had to portray deaf and mute children, they had to rely on their facial gestures, sign language, and sounds (cries and screams). They were simply amazing at depicting complex emotions. Johan Lebbing is wrong. Gong Yoo is not holding a bible at the end of the movie (that would make no sense whatsoever in this movie). He's taking the subway and holding a cake from Tous Les Jours (a Korean boulangerie/patisserie chain) because it's Christmas.

61,mouisr,When true art contributee to positive changes.,10,27 January 2019,"""Silenced"" or ""Do-ga-ni"" is a south korean drama movie released in 22 September 2011, directed by Hwang Dong-Hyuk, and adapted from his novel ""the crucibles"", starring Gong Yoo and Jung Yu-Mi. The movie is based on true events that happened in ""Mujin"" a city in South Korea, exactly at a school for hearing impaired, where deaf children were sexually assaulted by their teachers and principals in 2004.
Kang In Ho (Gong Yoo) is a newly appointed teacher in a school for hearing impaired in Mujin, where he faced the shocking truth that the children were sexually and physically abused by their teachers,after noticing their fear and weird behaviour. He decides with the help of a human rights activist ""Seo Yoo-jin"" (Jung Yu-Mi) to defend the children's rights , but they realized that the principals and even the police are involved in this case. The judge was bribed, and after a long fight in the court room, the opressed children didn't get their rights and the faculty members got a very light sentence.
In my modest opinion, I consider the movie ""Silenced"" as one of the best touching, powerful movies that I had never watched, though the end is heartbreaking, but in the reality, this movie had a big impact , it created a real debate in South Korea, which caused the reopening of the case and punishing the teachers and everyone who was involved and escaped the law. Also,new laws were enacted to protect children's rights.
This movie shows the real goal of art, that is exposing the truth and contributing to positive changes.
