0,TheLittleSongbird,A winner of a family film- Casper is so cute!,8,15 November 2009,"I really liked this movie, I seriously don't get the low rating. It is a most enjoyable family film, that is really sweet. My only complaints are one or two dull spots in the script and plot(primarily in the middle) and I didn't feel as though the direction was as good as it could have been. The special effects however are simply wonderful, and the sets are suitably dark and Gothic. But what made this movie for me was Casper, forgive me but he is so cute. The whole movie is well worth seeing just for him, but there are many other good things about this film too. The dance sequence especially is delightful.The music by the ever reliable James Horner is lovely, and the performances are very good. Christina Ricci matches Casper beautifully in a delightfully sweet central performance, and while Bill Pullman has been better he gives an appealing performance. Eric Idle is hilarious when he is given good material, and on the whole that's what he had. Although his dialogue wasn't always as funny as it could have been, he was still entertaining. But it is Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso who provide the most laughs. It is Cathy Moriaty though who comes close to stealing the show, with a brilliantly wacky portrayal as the villain of the piece. The script is funny and touching on the most part despite the one or two dull spots in the middling half.Overall, a winning family film. Not perfect by all means, but underrated you bet it is. At the end of the day, it's Casper's picture. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Casper
1,SnoopyStyle,mostly a harmless kids movie,6,12 May 2015,"Carrigan Crittenden (Cathy Moriarty) is angry that her father left her only a rundown mansion. Her sniveling lawyer Paul Plutzker (Eric Idle) finds out that it has buried pirate gold. The house is haunted by Casper the friendly ghost and his not-so-friendly uncles; Stretch, Fatso and Stinkie. Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) became a therapist to the dead after the heartbreaking death of his wife and brings his daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) to every job. Carrigan hires Harvey to get the pesky ghosts out of the way.This is mostly a harmless kids movie. Ricci is adorable and sharp. She's the star of the movie. Bill Pullman is OK as the father. He could be more of a bumbling nerd. Moriarty is always good as a broad villain. Casper is not that bad and retains his cartoon nature. He has a great childlike persona. Although I would like the ghosts to be less transparent. The story is fine until the father dies. That's where the movie loses me a little. It's a bit too dark and serious dealing with life and death.",Casper
2,Hitchcoc,Generally Forgettable,6,31 December 2016,"The animation and action are fine in this film, and Casper is cute. The problem is that the bad guys are just that. They could be going after virtually any property. They reminded me of Cruela DeVille and her minions. They feel there is a treasure in the house and will stop at nothing to get it. Of course, when you have ghosts who are tricksters and concerned about their haunting place, they are going to retaliate. There are some nice scenes where Casper makes contact with the young girl and they become friends. Eric Idle is pretty funny as always. But overall, I walked away thinking nothing special. Typical of many movies made at that time.",Casper
3,mark.waltz,A delight for children and adults who can find the inner-child in them.,6,6 August 2013,"Taking the classic comic book and cartoon onto the big screen, this version of the story of the friendly ghost gives the viewer an inside look as to who Casper really was and his life before and after becoming the sweet spirit. Fresh from her star-making role of Wednesday Addams, Christina Ricci is perfect to play the poor child who is initially scared of him but soon wants to help the spirit of the child find out the truths. Her father Bill Pullman also gets involved as do the sinister Eric Idle and Cathy Moriarty as the agent and owner of the house who hire Pullman to get rid of the spooks which includes more than just Casper. Moriarty is particularly entertaining as one of the most outrageous of greedy characters, and her shrieking (which made her the scene stealer of ""Soap Dish"") takes over here as well to make her unforgettably funny.There are some delightful surprises in this mostly sweet-natured tale of the tying together of two different generations of children, one live, the other dead, the greed of adults, and the Peter Pan like belief in a world beyond our grasp. Try not to feel tears of joy and nostalgia when Casper takes Ricci on the train ride to his long hidden bedroom and is later allowed to face the truth of why he is who he is. Ricci and Pullman too also face the loss of their mother and wife, although one of Casper's prankster uncle ghosts also gets in the way comically. This is a family film that proves to be innocent yet never juvenile and cloying.",Casper
4,kosmasp,The friendly Ghost (?),8,7 July 2021,"Well he's not alone ... literally as you will be able to see ... if you see the movie. Now I think I watched this back in the day, but I cannot be sure about that. What I do know is that the movie has quite a few cameos and shout outs to other movies ... like Ghostbusters - who you gonna call? Well apparently there is a different answer to this than the Ghostbuster movies suggested ... all kidding aside, what almost completely threw me off, the couple of second long cameos by people like Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson and the Crypt Keeper - yes you read that right.The story is predictable but the cast make this a more than enjoyable trip. Even when it almost feels creepy for adults to realize that the friendly ghost also is ... or has feelings - romantic feelings that is, if I were to put it mildly. But I don't think kids are that easy to offend or will be shocked by this. Not as much as some parents might be.Still this is a family movie and as such it works wonders (with some scary imagery thrown in for good measure) ...",Casper
5,gavin6942,"The Friendliest Ghost You Know, Plus Christina Ricci",6,19 February 2008,"A greedy woman inherits a mansion (""Whipstaff"") from her uncle, only to find it haunted with obnoxious ghosts. She, along with her attorney (Eric Idle), hire Father Guido Sarducci and the Ghostbusters to solve the problem. No dice. Next, they turn to Dr. Harvey (Bill Pullman), a psychiatrist for the ""living impaired"" who moves into Whipstaff with his daughter Kat (Christina Ricci). As Harvey confronts the ghosts, Kat forms a friendship with the one friendly spirit in the house: Casper.This film is great for a number of reasons. First, the computer effects. While I am no fan of CGI, this film really pushes the boundaries for 1995 (actually looking better than many films ten years later). Next, the cast. Many notable names here and a horde of cameos (Rodney Dangerfield, Clint Eastwood and more). All of which are wonderful actors (although Cathy Moriarty, who plays the greedy woman, has been called a ""poor woman's Cruella deVille"" and I think this is fair -- she is the weak point of the cast). And the pop culture jokes seal the deal, with even ""Apocalypse Now"" getting lampooned.I am left to wonder if this film was not inspired, at least in part, by William Castle's 1960 film ""13 Ghosts"". There, too, we have an eccentric uncle who has invented ghost-related inventions leaving his property to his sibling's child. Both films have a hidden treasure in the mansion, sought after by a greedy attorney. And both have the family encountering obnoxious but relatively harmless ghosts. Although, it could simply be that many films have such ideas (haunted mansions with hidden treasure) and I am just making loose connections in my mind.My friend Chelsea, who adores this film and whom I watched it with, has an infatuation with the James Horner soundtrack. It does not stand out for me and I do not think it is Horner's best work. But it is not bad, either... blending neatly into the background (which, it may be said, might make it even better... not overpowering the movie).This film is fun for all ages. It is a kids film, but has some adult content, too. And it is one of two of the notable Christina Ricci roles as a child (the other bring Wednesday Addams), so if you share a love of Ricci with me you will need to see this film. But all in all, the reason to see this is because it is cute and endearing... brilliant in its innocence, even when it touches those adult themes (such as the death of a child). If Amblin Entertainment brought us one good film since ""E.T."", this is it.",Casper
6,lee_eisenberg,Maybe there will always be the issue of life and death.,7,29 March 2006,"On one level, maybe ""Casper"" is just a kids' movie. But it does bring up the question of how we deal with our own mortality. The plot involves unctuous Carrigan Crittenden (Cathy Moriarty) and her crony Dibbs (Eric Idle) inheriting an abandoned mansion in Maine, only to find out that it's inhabited by people-hating ghosts. After a few failed attempts to get rid of these spirits, they hire Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman), who claims that he can communicate with the dead. When he and his daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) move in, they have a few unpleasant encounters with the ghosts, but settle down. Thus arises the issue of how to cohabit with specters and also please Crittenden.Overall, maybe there's nothing totally special about this movie; at face value, it seems to be all about quantity and not quality. But it does have some neat lines, and prompts us to consider what will become of ourselves post mortem.",Casper
7,jboothmillard,Casper,6,4 January 2007,"From the director of Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, this is quite a good live action romp with a cartoon character I used to watch sometimes. Basically the nasty Carrigan Crittenden (Cathy Moriarty) inherits a gloomy-looking mansion, but then she and sidekick Paul 'Dibbs' Plutzker (Eric Idle) discover a treasure map to a hidden treasure in the house. What they don't know is that Casper the Friendly Ghost (played by Malachi Pearson) is living there. He is the lonely ghost who only wants a friend, but scares anyone and everyone who catches one glimpse of him, this also goes for his mean uncles, Stretch (Joe Nipote), Stinkie (Joe Alaskey) and Fatso (Brad Garrett). So Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) is hired to exorcise the house, with daughter Kathleen 'Kat' Harvey (Christina Ricci), but they end up become quite comfortable with having ghosts. Also starring Ben Stein as Mr. Rugg, Rodney Dangerfield, Dan Aykroyd as Dr. Raymond Stantz (the Ghostbuster) and cameos by Clint Eastwood and Mel Gibson. A good family film thats on almost every Christmas. Good!",Casper
8,moonspinner55,"""Beetlejuice"" wannabe...",3,23 July 2006,"An unfortunate waste of a potentially good opportunity: a live-action adaptation of the Harvey Comics staple about a friendly ghost looking for friends, and the loner teen and her father who take up residence in the mansion haunted by Casper and other apparitions of the boo-and-cackle variety. As Roger Ebert pointed out at the time, it was completely wrongheaded of the screenwriters to delve into the history of Casper (revealed to be the ghost of a dead child!), which renders some of the wild, gross-out slapstick completely inappropriate. Sloppily-directed in the ""Beetlejuice"" vein by Brad Silberling, who is no Tim Burton. The production is slick and expensive, but the hammy material is broad and derivative, defeating leads Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci as well as cameo-players Dan Aykroyd and Rodney Dangerfield, among others. Under 10-year-olds probably won't notice. *1/2 from ****",Casper
9,Calicodreamin,Fun kids movie,6,9 June 2020,"A classic kids movie from the 90s starring the ever amazing Christina Ricci. Does most of what happens make any sense? No. But that's okay, it doesn't really matter. It's just a bunch of good fun with a few good laughs.",Casper
10,anaconda-40658,Not So Friendly Ghost.,3,19 June 2015,"Casper (1995): Dir: Brad Silberling / Cast: Christina Ricci, Bill Pullman, Cathy Moriarty, Eric Idle, Amy Brenneman: Mindless geek show unsuitable for children due to its excessive occult references. Lame plot introduces Bill Pullman plays a ghost therapist who communicates with spirits. Cathy Moriarty and Eric Idle play standard villains who hire him to rid ghost activity from a house so that they may gain a supposed treasure. Christina Ricci plays Pullman's daughter who befriends Casper who lives with three mischievous uncles. Director Brad Silberling does his best to create Casper's world with fantastic visual elements but that is about as far as the compliments go. Ricci is a decent young actress but this is pure cardboard. Pullman has no believable reactions to the ghosts, and his decision to get drunk and fall to his death is absolutely beyond moronic. Perhaps he was just reacting to the fact that he got casted in this sh*t to begin with. The whole scheme to bring him back to life is just about as stupid as this gets. Moriarty and Idle overact shamelessly as the idiotic villains. Their greed hits such a high pitch that they attempt to kill each other so that their spirit can get inside a safe to get the treasure. And this junk is suppose to be appealing to children. This all comes down to distasteful marketing that leaves Casper as not such a friendly ghost after all. Score: 3 / 10",Casper
11,Wuchakk,"Fun, silly ghost flick with Bill Pullman, Christina Ricci and Cathy Moriarty",6,12 October 2018,"A ghost-whispering paranormal expert and his daughter (Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci) move into a dilapidated mansion on the coast of Maine that's haunted by a friendly ghost and three mischievous ones. Cathy Moriarty plays the venal heir of the mansion and Eric Idle her assistant.""Casper"" (1995) delivers the goods if you're in the mood for a ""spooktacular"" Goosebumps-like horror film that's fun & silly and not scary at all. It's like Scooby-Doo but without the dog and the teens are tweens. ""Monster Night"" (2006) and ""Ghostbusters"" (1984) are other reference points, but I prefer ""Monster Night,"" which has a similar plot, but is all-around more entertaining (even though it cost significantly less) and has a superior assortment of good-lookin' women, young and older. With ""Caspar"" there's Moriarty, but she plays the biyatch antagonist. There's also ricci, but she was only 14 during shooting, although she's effective in the role.The movie runs 1 hour, 40 minutes and was shot at Universals City, California, with establishing shots of Rockport, Maine.GRADE: B-/C+",Casper
12,Smells_Like_Cheese,Since when did Casper become romantic?,7,29 November 2003,"Casper, the friendly ghost, is now in computer form! :D I have to admit, when I became a teenager, I doubted this movie just to be kinda cool and not enjoy a kid's movie. But I babysit often, and my cousins wanted to watch this again, so I slipped it in. You know what? I enjoyed it and I think I'm willing to admit that I liked it.I love this family movie because it has not only kid humor, but adult humor as well. Christina Ricci and Bill Pullman were great and it was fun to watch their first time reactions moving into the house with the evil uncles that are ""disgusting and obnoxious creeps"". I love their response to that ""Thank you!"". Casper is just a polite ghost who wants to have friends and be human again. When he discovers that his father invented a machine to make ghosts humans again, he and Christina find the only potion left that's enough for him to become human. Of course, we have our villains who want a ""hidden treasure"" in the mansion and set up Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci in the house to get to it. They figure the best way is to have one of them die and be able to just go through the safe. Of course, they must come back human and the only way is the potion that's enough for one person. We have another problem of the uncle's taking Bill on a drinking trip to make him one of their own to ""see"" his deceased wife.There is a very touching ending and I would always recommend this for a family watch. It's a cute movie with some fun jokes and cool effects. So, I am actually going to admit that I had fun and am going to give a good rating.7/10",Casper
13,Rainey-Dawn,A Cute Film,8,13 October 2014,"I found Casper to be quite entertaining. It's a great film for the entire family and a good one to watch around Halloween. The story is quite sad yet very funny and the special effects are superb. To summon up this film, I would say ""young love at it's finest"".This movie brings to my mind thoughts of ""if I could talk to a loved one who is dead"" and/or ""if I could meet someone that is dead"". The curiosity of meeting someone from another time period even if they are dead (a ghost) came to my mind while watching this film. Thoughts of talking to dead family members also weighed on my mind as the film progressed.8/10",Casper
14,disdressed12,"fitting it's about a ghost,",3,14 October 2008,"since it has no soul.i think it's supposed to be a fun family movie,but i didn't see it.not only was this movie immensely dull,it was also depressing.talk a bout all style,and no substance.i made it about halfway through before i really wanted it to end.but i managed to watch right to th end credits.it has a few minor curse words,but nothing drastic.i think it would be appropriate for anyone over 10,depending on how mature the child is,and how liberal the parents are.anyway,i wish i could say there were some fun moments,but i can't recall any,and i just finished watching the movie less than 10 minutes ago.there were some moments i'm sure were intended as comic relief,but they all came off flatter than a pancake.this is all just my opinion,and i'm sure a lot of people enjoyed the movie.but for me,Casper gets a 3/10",Casper
15,ElMaruecan82,A forgotten little gem of the 90's...,7,11 September 2017,"As far as special effects were concerned, 1995 was a year with quite a special effect on the technological department of filmmaking. And I'm not even speaking out of facts gathered from IMDb or Wikipedia but from my own memories. Indeed, I'm old enough to remember all the buzz around ""Toy Story"", the first major animated movie all in 3D, the Pixar that started it all and paved the way to a new revolutionary substitution for hand-made drawings. I can also remember the fuss about ""Jumanji"", a film so overflowed by CGI that the story seemed almost accessory. And if memory doesn't fail me, I remember that the opening explosion of ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" was quite a remarked practical effect. But there's an unfairly forgotten little gem whose special effects garnered a fair deal of applause yet the film itself didn't hold up very well despite being in the same vein of inspirational sweetness than ""Toy Story"".In fact, I'd go as far as saying that ""Casper"" almost plays like the kid brother of ""E.T."". Steven Spielberg was the executive producer and you can tell from the few little nods made to the film that the film wasn't just intended to be a CGI fest. Indeed, computer imagery wasn't a new thing in 1995 and the early precursors (such as ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Terminator 2"") had proved something essential: all the special effects of the world can't amount to much if there's no story to justify them. Yet ""Casper"" might be the one exception because you can say the real star is the special effect, because it's the first film where the lead protagonist is entirely made in computer, it's an unprecedented feat. Brad Silberling's movie has lead human characters but you can feel a kinship with a movie like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". There's a difference though with Zemeckis' movie: ghosts are transparent, they fly, float and can't touch humans, which simplifies the crossover but on the other hand, they also extend the possibilities and the range of action. It's not as easy as it seems, you have to deal with characters who pop up everywhere, who can make the body either freeze or elastically move, and there's a moment where Bill Pullman tries to handle Casper's mischievous uncles and his body language is very convincing. One of the strengths of the film is to handle ghosts like characters with properties and abilities of their own and make them adapt to human standards or humans trying to interact with them, which provides a nice share of action, fun and even tenderness that the format of the initial cartoon couldn't carry. I knew Casper from the cartoons but I never ""enjoyed"" him, I found him too bland and dull as a lead character, but I did enjoy the horrified reactions of people, one of the series' running gags. So, there has always been a little comedic aspect of ""Casper"", which the film efficiently explores while also testing more dramatic waters, portraying Casper, not as a ghost but as a deceased child. This was a gutsy move because it seems to establish the rule that once you're a ghost, your face turns into an animated version of yourself, a rule abandoned though for the climax, which we forgive since it does work on an emotional level. ""Casper"" is a film to watch without cynical eyes in order to embrace its sensitivity and gentleness, even the uncle trio who provide the obligatory spice aren't as bad as they seem and their presence is obviously meant to be a wink to more adult audiences.But watching the film so many years after, I think the friendship story works even better than the rest, it seems to be infused with a sweetness that lacks today. Granted the issue of Casper or Kat (Christina Ricc) is of universal level but can you imagine today a teenage girl complaining about not having friends, in the days of virtual relationships? Kat would be so busy on her i-phone she wouldn't even notice Casper, and if she did, maybe she'd try to have a selfie with him. Would still kids be scared of Casper? Wouldn't they try to get him on film and play it on Youtube? ""Casper"" reassured me that I still belonged to a generation that would act like Elliott and ""E.T."" And Ricci's performance confirmed what her acting showed in ""The Addams Family"", she is a very underrated actress, what a change from the creepy Wednesday to the sweet and open-minded Kat, and she's the perfect counter-balance to her zanier father, played by Pullmann.The casting is quite excellent in fact, from the voice actors to a pair of nasty villains played by Cathy Moriarty and Eric Idle, not to mention some very well-thought nods to the cinematic realm of ghosts. That cameo of Dan Aykryod alone was funnier than any moment from the dreadful ""Ghostbusters 3"" and of course, I had my share of horrified reactions and Bill Pullman's opening the closest only to find Casper remains one of my funniest memories. The man is a psychiatrist, supposedly dealing with the dead and more hilarious than the scream itself is the knowledge that it comes from someone who couldn't stop bragging about his 'ghost' connection. The film did well at the box-office but it's a shame it's not remembered as well, maybe the relative thinness of the plot or that it came too early or too late, I don't know, I can only speak for the teen I was and who enjoyed the film, and the adult who enjoyed it even better.So, not much ""E.T."", not quite ""Harry Potter"", but it's a sweet, gentle film that all the family can enjoy, and I don't know why it shouldn't be recommended.",Casper
16,Edvis-1997,5,5,15 April 2021,"Even considering it was released in 1995 back in those days it was already boring and lack of context. To watch it nowadays it's just impossible, overrated far to be called classic or a good movie.",Casper
17,tabuno,"Wonderful, Magical Children's Movie",8,8 January 2019,"11 November 2017. Yes, Casper could be considered a dumb movie, and yet there is something that tickles the magical and entertainment portion of one's brain. Casper, based on the cartoon, is supposed to be comical, hilarious, and juvenile. What the movie accomplishes even more so is to bring another level of emotional sensitivity and reflective sadness and depth, and redemption to what was considered a pretty childish comic series.Somehow all the dumb prankster jokes seem to work in this movie. There is a tenderness underlying the movie along with a fascinating family theme that even includes death and the afterlife. It is both heartbreaking as well as morally uplifting. It's a wonder that today's kids can even begin to comprehend the world of real death and ethical decisions that they may be exposed to now without such mass entertainment of which Casper was one.(May 9, 2019. James Horner's haunting musical score blends brilliantly with several important movie scenes that brings to a life and emotional intensity that rivals any musical production in most any film.}.In sum, Casper is an educational, moral, entertaining contribution to the film industry.",Casper
18,ironhorse_iv,BOOOOOOOOO!!! This movie sucks!,5,20 February 2016,"While, I was never a huge fan of the 1950's Famous Studios theatrical animated cartoon series of the same name. I have to say, at least that had some heart. This movie directed by Brad Silberling is nearly soulless. It's child-unfriendly humor and an overly-dark tone, with completely pointless backstory is something, this beloved cartoon didn't need. It was too grim. I don't know why, I gave this movie, a try, when it first came out. Maybe, it's because it had Christina Ricci as the main lead, Kathleen ""Kat"" Harvey searching why the ghosts, haunt their house, while also looking for buried treasure. She was one of my celebrity crush, when I was growing up in the 1990s. However, I wasn't as obsess with her, like Casper (Voiced by Malachi Pearson) was here. He was borderline creepy in this film. The way, he says 'Can I keep you?' is chilling, not in a good way. Also, the way, he find her, attractive in his dead mother's dress is kinda gross. I thought, he was supposed to be a friendly ghost, not an obsessive serial stalker. I really don't like, the necrophilia type relationship between the two. Another thing, I hate about the film is how annoying and mean-spirited Casper's uncles, are. Are we sure, this movie is based on the Harvey Comics by Seymour Reit and Joe Oriolo of the same name? I don't really, remember, the ghost that Casper hang out with, being so ugly-headed and obnoxious. I would rather have the original, Fatso, Lazo, and Fusso than these new Ghostly Trio, Stretch (Voiced by Joe Nipote), Stinkie (Voiced by Joe Alaskey) and Fatso (Voiced by Brad Garrett). They are the worst thing about this movie. Their use of vulgar language and toilet humor was indeed too jarring for me. Not only that, but they try to kill the main characters of the film, throughout the film. How are we supposed to cheer for these folks!? Not only that, but this movie's illogical use of pointless celebrity cameos, and several weak plots is another trouble with this film. As much as I love seeing, cameos by Don Novello as the exorcist, Father Guido Sarducci, and Dan Aykroyd as Ghostbusters' Dr. Ray Stantz as good in-jokes. I really don't get, the film's logic, here. The particularly scene where the Ghostly Trio goes inside Dr. Harvey (Bill Pullman) and changes him into Clint Eastwood, Rodney Dangerfield, Mel Gibson, and the Crypt Keeper was odd. It is never mentioned again throughout the rest of the film, nor do the trio ever use their apparent morphing-abilities again. Honestly, what is the rules of this film afterlife!? Supposedly, in this movie; ghosts are the spirits of people who had some important business left unfinished due to their death. So, what the hell is Casper's unfinished business? He says in the film that he became a ghost so that his parents wouldn't be alone since he died, but this makes no sense given the plot, since his parents died afterwards. So, if his original unfinished business was just that. Why is he still, on earth!? I get that, maybe, Casper's unfinished business was his entire life. Dying at such a young age, he never had the chance to live, and thus he remains earthbound until he experiences enough to allow him to pass on. Still, it doesn't explain, what happen to Casper's dead parents!? Did they go to heaven without him!? It's not like them, to abandon Casper! After all, when his father was alive, he built a resurrection machine just to be with his son, again. The worst possibility is that, the parents did become a ghosts, but forgot who they were and ended up leaving the manor without their son, or God punish his parents for 'playing God' and sent them to hell. Even that, doesn't make sense, since the villain of this film, was sent to heaven. The film is full of inconsistent. Way too much of it, like why does the ghosts in the film able to walk through walls, but not through something simple like vacuum bags!? How are they able to pick up some items, yet not others? Why are they able to leave, their place of haunting? Also, isn't it a bit odd, that some of the ghosts look ghostly, cartoonish of their self, while Casper looks nothing like himself, when was alive? I get that, he might be dead for a long time, and forgot what his features looks like, but this forgetting plot doesn't quite work out, since other recent ghost appears to have lost all their memories and still looks like their former selves. It get more confusing, when, Dr. Harvey's dead wife comes into the picture. She looks pretty normal, despite being dead. Also, if a ghost did use the machine, where does the body, come from, and what happen to old body? Also, why didn't Casper's parents used it? Despite all those jarring questions, the CGI work is still very convincing for 1995. Most of the acting was alright. The music by James Horner was ghoulish fun, haunting and emotional touching as well. There's also a musical number by the Ghostly Trio called 'Lucky Enough to Be a Ghost', which was cut because the special effects needed to create it, was too expensive. The rough drafts can still be found on the DVD. In my opinion, the film would work more, if they cut out, other scenes like the whole bullies trying to ruin the Halloween party, sub-plot. Movie has way too much filler as well. Overall: Despite all that, it nevertheless gained a bit of a cult following and was a success at the box office. It gained a few DTV sequels. However, I agree with Russell Harvey, heir to the Harvey Comics legacy, who hated this film. This film is unfunny and very unpleasant to watch, because of that. I can't recommended watching this 1990s kid movie at all.",Casper
19,slightlymad22,Perfect family entertainment,7,27 September 2014,"I'll admit right from the off I'd never heard of 'Casper The Friendly Ghost' until 1993 when I went to my local multiplex to see the Kevin Costner and Clint Eastwood movie 'A Perfect World' in which a child steals a Halloween costume. So I didn't know much going into this movie. I believe this is the first feature film with a computer-animated title character, and for me the effects are outstanding. Eric Idle and Cathy Moriarity are splendidly devious, if under used, whilst fresh from pairing with Sandra bullock in 'While You Were Sleeping' Bill Pullman is a lot of fun as the Dad.As for Christina Ricci, following on from her awesome performances in the Addams Family movies, it was around this time I thought, she had the potential to be a good Demi Moore type actress, once she grew up. Things haven't quite panned out that way, but she is still a working actress. Coincidently she would costar with Moore in 'Now & Then' the same year, but she was not playing a younger Moore, as I expected, but a younger version of Rosie O Donnell. Poor casting in my eyes.There are some nice cameos from Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson Rodney Dangerfield, but it's the appearance of Dan Aykroyd as Dr. Raymond Stantz (from Ghostbusters (1984)) who runs out of the house frantically and says, ""Who you gonna call? Someone else!"" That brought the biggest smile to my face.",Casper

21,paulclaassen,Way too much slapstick for my liking...,4,21 September 2020,"I saw 'Casper' many years ago. Watching it now as an adult crushed my fond memories of the film. The film contains an incredible amount of slapstick humor (just the way Americans like it...).The film mostly plays like a live action cartoon. The humor is more suited for kids - very young kids. I simply couldn't relate to the humor at all. As the film progressed, it matured a bit, introducing deeper themes to an otherwise silly story. Unfortunately, this hint of maturity arrived much too late in the film and by that time I couldn't care less. The constant slapstick humor was too much for the film to be salvaged.On a positive note, the film's production design is incredible with amazing sets. The visual effects, I'm sure, were very good for its time. For anyone who has lost a loved one, the film is sure to resonate long after the closing credits. Pity about all that slapstick. Then again, Casper really is based on children's cartoons. The integrated mature theme was merely a way to ensure a wider appeal. Unfortunately, it didn't satisfy my senses.",Casper
22,filipemanuelneto,One of my childhood movies that is always worth revisiting.,10,24 July 2021,"Certain films earn our affection for the quality they have, others for the visual beauty and the grandeur of the technical means used... others, like this film, conquer their place by the way they touch us. I may not be the only one who saw this movie as a child and now feels some nostalgia and affection to see it again.The film hardly needs any introduction, telling us the story of Casper, a ghost who settled in the land after dying very young, and haunts his old house in the company of three uncles, who are the real terror of the region. The house's fate seems sealed when it ends up in the hands of an ambitious heiress, eager to demolish it and get hold of a treasure she thinks is hidden there. Unable to make it thanks to the ghosts' efforts, she decides to call an expert, Dr. Harvey, to get them out of there. It's precisely what Casper wanted most, as the academic travels with a teenage daughter he fell in love with when he saw her on television.The film isn't brilliant, it's not meant to be. It is not an award winner, nor will it give us the dramatic life performance of any of the actors involved. It is simply a family film, aimed at younger people, but which also knows how to please adults, and which, despite its age, remains fresh and current today. For me, who saw it as a child, it will always have a corner in my video library.The film was the first to make live actors act opposite characters entirely made by computer graphics, and from that point of view it was a pioneering film. However, Casper, Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso are characters in their own right and their voices were lent by a group of good actors: Joe Nipote, Joe Alaskey, Brad Garrett and Malachi Pearson. They are the soul of the film and steal our attention whenever they are present. The young Christina Ricci, in one of the early career jobs, also shows unmistakable signs of talent. Bill Pullman is effective, convincing and entertaining in his role, Eric Idle is very funny, and Cathy Moriarty is very good as a villain.Technically, it's an effective movie. As I said before, it excels in its pioneering use of fully CGI characters, and the visual, special and sound effects used are really good, and they seem convincing even after twenty years. Cinematography doesn't surprise us, but it doesn't disappoint either. The pace of the film is regular, fast and fun, as it should be, and all the sets and costumes are very good, in particular the magnificent Whipstaff mansion, which would become iconic thanks to its Art Nouveau design, worthy of the best ideas of Antoni Gaudí. The film's music is ensured by the ever-reliable James Horner.",Casper

26,lisafordeay,I enjoyed this as a kid,6,1 November 2014,"Casper is a 1995 film that stars Bill Pullman from While You Were Sleeping,Christina Ricci from Penellope and Brad Garrett who voices Fatso in this movie. The movie tells the story of Casper a friendly boy who happens to be a ghost. Kat Harvey(Ricci)and her dad Dr James Harvey(Pullman) (who is a ghost hunter btw)move to another city and land in a house that was once owned by a young boy who use to live there.But what Kat and her dad don't know is that Casper and his uncles Stretch,Fatso and Stinkie are still living in the house. Of course the reason why Dr Harvey moves is because these people(who were going to live in this house that they moved in,is haunted so he stays there with his daughter).Also Dr James Harvey lost his wife so he raises Kat by himself.So when Kat one day is packing her bags in her room,Casper shows up and she freaks out that she can see him. Kat of course has to start school and she gets bullied by this girl who wants to have a Halloween party. But when Kat mentions that she lives in a haunted house,the kids want Kat to have her party in her place. But the girl who bullies her sets up some guy to go with her as a date where she has her party. Of course Casper later falls for Kat and his afraid to admit it since Casper is dead and can't come back to life. So he tells Kat later on in the film that there is a machine that his deceased dad worked on that can bring people back to life again. So will Casper become a human and be with Kat?Well overall I liked this film as a kid and I found it to be a truly heartwarming story. The charcthers are cute and I like the chemistry between Ricci and the guy that voices Casper. Also I like how Casper wishes to be human for one night and Ricci's charcthers mom shows up and makes his wish come true. So he becomes a human for the night to be Kat's date. I found it cute.Overall like I said I liked this movie as a kid and I still do.6/10",Casper
27,snoozejonc,Works well as a children's movie,5,26 October 2020,"A ghost psychologist and his daughter move into a haunted house to help remove some unwanted guests.The movie is technically superb with CGI characters who blend excellently with live action performers and the setting of the haunted house gives it the right atmosphere. You'd have to be pretty cold hearted not to find Casper a likeable title character.Christina Ricci doesn't feel suited to this type of role but she does well nonetheless. Her relationship with Casper feels just about plausible and she interacts well with Bill Pullman as her father.Where I struggled was the humour, but I appreciate this is a very subjective aspect of any presentation. There is a massive reliance on slapstick and most of the banter doesn't work for me. I don't think Bill Pullman was a great choice and it feels a shame that it wasn't somebody like Robin Williams who would have been perfect and might have turned it into classic. Cathy Moriarty and Eric Idle perform well, but they don't really have much material to work with. That being said, some of the cameo appearances are great, particularly Dan Ackroyd, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.The plot is a great concept and could have been more poignant and heartfelt, but as all the silliness dominates, it all ends up feeling a bit of an uneven mess. However I do appreciate it was aimed at young children so I don't want to be too negative as there were a lot of scenes my daughter enjoyed.There are some movies that are so good they work to entertain both the intended very young audience and the parents. This one works well on the intended audience in my house.",Casper
28,lukem-52760,"DEEPLY EMOTIONAL & REALLY QUITE BEAUTIFUL FANTASY FILM, BIG NOSTALGIC LOVE FOR THIS MOVIE",9,4 August 2018,"I love Casper ever since seeing it in 1995 & had it on video & watched it loads of times. Casper has so much charm & magic with so much heart too, i remember always getting tears in my eyes when Casper starts to remember his childhood & when Dr.harvey finally sees the spirit of his dead wife, all BEAUTIFUL moments!!!
Casper encapsulates the Early 90's beautifully & that was my time of growing up & i loved Tales from the Crypt which the Crypt Keeper gets a fun little cameo here & my fave Ghostbuster Ray, it's all pure 90's & my growing up days so big Nostalgic love for this sweet & touching Family special effects comedy.
The cast is perfect especially Dr.harvey the excellent BILL PULLMAN & Christina Ricci both fantastic in their roles & are really great performances.
The FX still look AMAZING even today & the big old mansion is beautiful to look at & the detail & production design is truly OUTSTANDING!!! Casper is funny & feelgood but also like i said full of heart & magic, also a great little scene that i absolutely love is the scene when RAY STANTZ from GHOSTBUSTERS comes running out of whipstaff manor & says ""who are you gonna call,some one else"" lol great bit part as my favourite movie is Ghostbusters 2 i love those movies & RAY STANTZ is my favourite Ghostbuster!!! A little throwaway bit or a look closer & it could mean a shared universe? Good fun.
Anyway Casper really is a childhood classic of mine & i will always have a soft spot for this charming & touching tale of a lost spirit, A really nice 90s Nostalgic film.The look of this supernatural Comedy is actually beautiful with the cosy lighting in whipstaff manner & the stunning night time scenes outside with the full moon & the gorgeous look of the little town of Friendship, this all looks fantastic because it's shot through the lens of one of the greatest cinematographers of Cinema History DEAN CUNDEY!!! this legend shot tons of films including Classic's like John Carpenters The Thing, The Fog, Halloween 1&2, Flubber, back to the future, Jurassic Park & many more.Also i gotta mention again how great Bill Pullman is here as the troubled Dr. Harvey, it's a nice family man performance & shows a nice father & daughter relationship with Christina Ricci as Cat, that starts off strained but over the film they reconnect nicely & bond once again, as a father with daughters i like this.
I love the fact the legendary Steven Spielberg was a producer on ""Casper"" & often his input & presence is felt with the Nostalgic sense of wonder & the more emotional & heart felt moments, this feels like a ""Spielberg"" movie, yes there's times when it gets really silly & doesn't make much sense logically or scientifically lol but hey it's a big budget fantasy Ghost movie & at that it's alot of Spooky fun.
Also another great element is the really lovely score performed by the legendary JAMES HORNER!!! it seems the best of the best worked on this movie & made it the best they could.
Director Brad Silderling does a great job directing the special fx fantasy parts & the more dramatic parts & creating a lovely Family film with lots of Heart & a feel of adventure, now he hasn't done alot of films but most recently there's one he Directed that i loved ""The Land of the Lost"" from 2009 starring Will Ferrell, another big budget special fx Comedy & it's great fun.
I grew up watching & loving this cosy supernatural family film & i love it's pure 90's feel & tone, especially with having the great Bill Pullman as our lead as i loved him at his peak during the 90's with his Big films such as ""Independence Day"" & ""Lake Placid"" among others.
""CASPER"" will always have a special place in my heart & my childhood.
Deeply emotional & really beautiful, & gives a comforting feeling about the afterlife, if there is one?
A lovely 90's Nostalgic fantasy film",Casper
29,dwpollar,"Entertaining, touching, and funny movie...",6,12 March 2001,"1st watched 2/1/1997 - (Dir-Brad Silberling): Entertaining, touching, and funny movie with excellent special effects. This was a real surprise to me because I truly was not expecting to like this movie, but left being affected by the wonderful relationship that occurred between a ghost & Miss Ricci.(who seems to always be likeable whatever she's in)",Casper
30,davispittman,Didn't work,3,5 April 2016,"Cathy Moriarty is the best thing in this movie, let's just make that real clear right now. Her acting was actually good, and I liked her in her villain character. As for Bill Pullman, not so much, I really felt like he was miscast in the father role. But then again, he didn't have very good material to work with here. The script is muddled and unfunny, and the movie as a whole just didn't really work, in my opinion that is. This is supposed to be a funny, cute, family movie about Casper the friendly ghost, but we didn't. I think the biggest reason this movie just doesn't make you laugh, it attempts, but it does not succeed, at least not with me it didn't. The actors seem kinda uncomfortable and unsure as to what the heck is going on, except for Cathy Moriarty, like I said before, she's good. I love her big line in this movie: ""the b**ch is back!"" Even though I was surprised to hear that line in a family movie, but I liked it, I thought it brought power, that was about the only line I thought was good lol. Christina Ricci was so so, she annoyed me at times, but she wasn't bad in this, she was just alright, nothing to point at and brag about, but nothing to be ashamed of either. Overall, this just did not work for me. 3/10, it only got that high really because of Moriarty.",Casper
31,gcd70,Acceptable kids flick,5,21 February 2008,"""The Friendly Ghost"" has arrived on the big screen! But why? Well I guess the answer to that question is an easy one to find. Basically ""Casper"" has just joined the mass procession of cartoon characters who have found their way to the silver screen. None of our beloved heroes of TV. and comic strips seem safe from what now appears to be an obligatory transformation. After ""Superman"" made a killing at the box office in 1978, it's been an ever increasing trend that has reached a peak in recent years with movie producers scrambling to secure the film rights to the few remaining animated stars.Of course for those that have made the transition, such as ""Batman"", ""The Flinstones"" and ""The Jetsons"", it has not only been financially rewarding, but has also benefited several directors, actors and even a few audiences. This particular movie is another one of those feebly plotted vehicles that attempts to just dazzle us visually, and this it achieves very successfully.Special effects are a sensationally flashy display from Industrial Light and Magic, creating the spooks, and the havoc they cause, with startling effect. As in ""Roger Rabbit"", this flick has interaction between animated creations and real people taking place, and most convincingly too! While the cartoonists have a ball, actors Bill Pullman, Christina Ricci, Cathy Moriarty and Eric Idle (as well as support) very commendably play out their parts. Pullman has fun with his unusually comic, slapstick role, as Dr James Harvey, spiritual psychologist. As his daughter Kat, Ricci easily adopts the role of the lonely teen moppet who yearns for a place to call home and some companionship (which our friendly ghost would be more than happy to give her). Cathy Moriarty makes a fine villainess as Carrigan Crittenden, and Eric Idle is her bumbling sidekick, Dibs.Director Brad Silberling brings all the action and mayhem together quite deftly, only being at fault perhaps for trying to inject an emotional element into ""Casper"" (all he produces is sappiness). Fortunately it is comedy that this picture stands upon, and at times it is indeed hilarious. Look out for some special cameos from some of our very favourite film stars. ""Casper"" is quite acceptable as a kids flick also, never being gross or excessive, and perhaps only the mild expletives may be found offensive.Final word goes to the art direction and set decoration teams, led by production designer Leslie Dilley, who have fashioned some brilliant scenery for us to feast our eyes upon. The outrageous Whipstaff Manor is certainly a sight to behold. James Horner has provided the score.Friday, August 4, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema",Casper
32,TOMNEL,"Good for children's fare, but still marred by it's sticky sweetness.",7,28 October 2008,"Casper is one of the most entertaining children's films I've seen. The special effects are good and cool looking, though back in 1995 they had a bigger impact than they would to someone now. The problem with this movie is it's many corny, clichéd scenes and lines that induce cringing and rolling of the eyes. Other than that, and some weird plot devices, this is a nice family movie, that actually can be enjoyed by the entire family.Carrigan (Cathy Moriarty) cares about nothing but money, and all her deceased father left her was Flagstaff Manor. Supposedly there is a hidden treasure in this mansion. Unfortunately, it's also haunted. Carrigan and her bumbling idiot sidekick Dibbs (Eric Idle) try to get rid of the ghosts through various ways, but in the end they turn to Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman), a psychiatrist to the dead, to help their dilemma. Harvey and his daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) end up meeting the ghosts of the house. Casper is the nice one who just wants a friend, and Casper's horrible uncles Stinky, Stretch and Fatso who only want to scare people. Chaos ensues, Casper and Kat bond, Dr. Harvey tries to help the uncles and learn what has become of his deceased wife, and Carrigan tries to get the houses treasure through any means.The direction here is stellar. This is an atmospheric movie with some lovely shots, and with the material they had to work with (Which isn't bad material) the direction and style was good. The acting depends on the scene. Bill Pullman always acted the same and his character worked well, but Christina Ricci would sometimes overact a bit. Nonetheless, there was nothing unforgivable acting wise. At times, this can be a touching movie. Casper has been developed beyond his former traditionally animated self, and not only continues to have a heart, but has a moving background. You actually feel sad for this computer animated puff of air. Kat also has a sad background, though I didn't find myself caring as much that she lost her mother. A lonely 12 year old ghost who just wants a friend is just a tragic character, but of course, in a family movie this isn't going to be a tragedy.Along with the good, there was bad. Too many scenes featured cringe worthy lines such as Casper's question to Kat, ""Can I keep you?"" It was supposed to be sweet, and it was...just a little too sweet. The plot was sidetracked too much by subplots, which would be fine if there was any real coherent plot. From what I can tell, the main plot is that Casper wants to become alive again with the help of his father's invention. The climax is also short and rushed. These are little things though, one's that I didn't notice until after the movie was over.Casper is a sweet movie, that sometimes gives into being too sweet, but mostly it has a great mixture of emotion, comedy and special effects that make this a winner family flick.My rating: *** out of ****. 101 mins. PG for thematic elements, violence and language.",Casper
33,aidanratesmovies,Underrated Halloween Treat,7,24 October 2021,"From a meager start to an unforgettably sweet conclusion- Casper made me laugh cry and smile all more than once and rightfully deserves its spot among the highest grossing Halloween films. First off, I just have to say, I love Christina Ricci as an actress. She is so much fun to watch on screen and you can see how dedicated she is in each of her performances. Of course she was also fun in this film alongside the underrated Bill Pullman and of course our titular character voiced by actor Malachi Pearson. This film is honestly adorable- it's a fun campy 90's family flick with tons of gags and cameo's and such a fast paced sense of humor- it's very easy to watch. The special effects are rather ahead of its time as well, and work very well for what the film is going for, especially considering a CGI main character had never been done before up to this point. The set is incredibly well designed and the music is also rather well done. It's a charming film with some weaker moments. The main film I had with the film is the antagonists, who are rather bland and predictable, and quite honestly could have been cut out of the film altogether and it have been a whole lot better. Some moments don't age terribly well and it does have its weaker structural moments, but in the end- Casper took me by surprise as a rather enjoyable and incredibly sweet little film that I wouldn't mind watching again and even for future Halloween viewings.My Rating: 7.3/10.",Casper

Plus its super dark for kids: it has a nice balance where its targeting adults that were into Casper when they were kids, hoping the parents will pass on the love to their kids.This has a great cast, to include a young Christina Ricci (by far the best actor in this).Not everyone, even the quality actors give a perfect performance, but they meet the design, goofy characters from a comic.I've watched this movie so many times, and I've never been disappointed by it.",Casper
36,Lady_Targaryen,No such thing as ghosts?,8,30 January 2006,"I remember that when I watched 'Casper'in the movie theater I liked the story very much. Now,10 years later, I still enjoy this movie very much.Carrigan is an ambitious and evil woman, and when her father dies, all she wants is her father's money,but the only thing she inherits is a big and old mansion. Angry, she throws her father's will in the fire, until she realizes that the will has tips to go into a hidden treasure. The problem is that the mansion is damned and full of ghosts. She contacts Dr.James Harvey,(Bill Pullman) a paranormal expert and a type of a''ghosts' Shrink'' to take the ghosts away from her mansion. James and his daughter Kat(Christina Ricci) stay living in the mansion, while Dr. James tries to have success in his work. Strech,Fatso and Stinkie are Casper's uncles and they are not friendly at all; they love to scare people and to treat Casper very badly. Kat an Casper becomes friends, since friendship is what they were searching the most . Casper tells Kat about how he died and she tells him about her mother, that also died and is one of the reasons why her father become a ghost's shrink. We also see that Kat hates to travel all the country because of her father's job and how she is far away from being one of the ''popular girls''.One of the sweetest and cutest moments of this movie, is when Casper becomes a human and dances with Kat. It's sad and also very romantic. Sadly, Devon Sawa, the actor who played the human Casper doesn't look like that anymore.",Casper
37,areatw,Forgotten gem of the 90s,7,27 January 2018,"'Casper' was always a favourite of mine growing up and was one of the few films I could watch over and over without getting bored of. It's not often you come across a kids' film with a heart as big as this one; a storyline that is both entertaining and meaningful, happy yet sad, and able to be enjoyed by people of all ages and not just its target audience.It's a shame that most kids growing up now will have never seen or heard of 'Casper' but will be familiar with shallow, artificial and soulless films like 'Frozen' and 'The Lego Movie'. This film always brings back good childhood memories, it has that special something and I'd much rather watch this than the majority of modern day family movies.",Casper
38,IonicBreezeMachine,"Better than what you'd think, but is dragged down by unfocused screenplay",6,16 July 2020,"The 1995 film Casper came in the wake of a number of high profile films based on older properties. Some, like The Addams Family, Maverick, and Flintstones managed to achieve impressive box office and/or critical praise while others such as The Beverly Hillbillies, Car 54, Where Are You?, or Richie Rich were met with derision and scorn from critics and audiences. Casper falls somewhere towards to the upper end of the spectrum making it better than Flintstones by a considerable margin, but not nearly as funny or memorable as The Addams Family.
Casper, based on the Harvey Comics character turned star of Famous Studios' series of theatrical shorts, follows the titular friendly ghost as he deals with the schemes of heiress Carrigan Crittenden(played delightfully over the top by Cathy Moriarty), his brash abrasive uncles The Ghostly Trio, a grieving paranormal psychologist and his outsider daughter, and a whole host of shenanigans from either the living or the dead. Needless to say there's elements I'm leaving out because they're either resolved to quickly to be of merit or contribute nothing to the movie.First the good. The performances are energized and give this movie the life it needs to justify itself. Regardless of the quality of the material, everyone here is bringing their A game be it Eric Idle as the put upon yes man, Bill Pullman as the quirky paranormal psychologist, Christina Ricci as the outsider daughter, and even Devon Sawa as Casper. Helping the performances is the amazing production design which helps create an incredible looking haunted house that feels almost like Disney's Haunted Mansion ride with more polish(though sometimes the film does feel a bit too much like a theme park ride in certain segments). The effects to create the ghosts are also quite impressive for the time, as they're designed very similarly to Jim Carrey's effects from The Mask with cartoonish exaggerations and elasticity that make them feel dynamic and alive(no pun intended).The Negatives. The script has problems finding pacing and direction. There's no one single story pulling the characters from scene to scene, the instigating plot involving Carrigan looking for a secret Treasure takes up the first 10 minutes of the movie and then is brought back for maybe 12 minutes towards the end of the movie. Scenes just kind of go from one to the next as there's really no callback style jokes or running gags linking the comic set pieces together, nor are there really character building scenes as they feel like islands without much thought to placement in a larger narrative.The movie is written by Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver, better known for their work on shows like Animaniacs and Tiny Toons Adventures and there's definitely a lot of their comic style on display with the Ghostly Trio who spout pop culture references and insults(with a surprising amount of hells and damns thrown in but that's honestly not much of a concern for me), but much of their comic scenes feel at odds with other scens that try to seriously address the nature of death and grief(including a very well staged scene where Casper looks over his sled remembering how he died) and the tone will whiplash from Snarky, to Zany, to serious sometimes within only a few seconds.Casper is the kind of movie you wish were better than it is. There's clear talent on display be it the production design, the direction, the acting, and even the special effects, but it's unfortunately weighed down by a lack of focus and can feel like a scattershot imitator of Beetlejuice with its teeth filed down. It's got good moments, they just don't come together as well as they should.",Casper
39,jeremycrimsonfox,"Good Movie, Despite Some Kid-Unfriendly Language",8,1 October 2019,"This is a good movie from my childhood. Based on the Harvey Comics, the story is heartwarming, as Casper meets a girl named Kat and her father, paranormal therapist James Harvey, after they are hired by Carrigan to get rid of Casper and his uncles, the Ghostly Trio in Whipstaff Manor so she can claim the treasure inside.It's a good family movie, but I have to give it eight stars as it does has some curisng (Kat telling Stretch one phrase in one scene). Also, there are some dark moments, but if you can see past those, this is a perfect family movie.",Casper
40,Beta_Gallinger,"Sometimes entertaining, sometimes dull",6,27 March 2008,"I was introduced to Casper at a very early age, and I remember often watching ""Casper the Friendly Ghost"", the 1945 animated short that first introduced the character to the world over forty years before I was born. I would have been around nine years old when this live action movie, featuring the cartoon character in CGI animated form, first came out. I remember seeing it twice during the '90s, though I don't think I saw the whole thing both times. If I never saw it in my childhood, I may have ended up never seeing it at all, but I just rented it yesterday, for what I believe was my first viewing of it in ten years, and it left me with mixed feelings.Carrigan Crittenden inherits Whipstaff Manor, a beat up mansion, which she is not happy with, but she and Paul ""Dibbs"" Plutzker find a map leading to a treasure in the mansion, and go there to find it. However, upon entering, they soon discover that the place is haunted by ghosts! Carrigan certainly won't give up here, so she hires Dr. James Harvey, a widowed psychic, to try and exorcise the building. James and his teenage daughter, Kathleen (or ""Kat"") move into this mansion. One of the ghosts who lives here is Casper, a lonely ghost who doesn't mean any harm, and just wants a friend, but since he a ghost, he still always scares people. Kat is scared of him at first, but he soon convinces her not to be. Unfortunately, however, Casper's three uncles, Fatso, Stinkie, and Stretch, are nasty ghosts, the kind who LIKE to scare people, and they will make Dr. Harvey's job at Whipstaff Manor more difficult! I had fairly low expectations before the last time I saw this movie. I think I liked it all those years ago, but it doesn't seem to be a very popular family movie. So, unsurprisingly, I saw a lot of mediocrity during the film. It's a comedy, and I wasn't laughing much. For example, while Kat is at school, and nobody else in the classroom knows Casper is there, he sneaks around and ties all the students' shoes together, so when the bell rings and they get up to leave, they all trip and fall. Pretty lame attempt at physical comedy if you ask me. However, there are some mildly amusing moments, like some of the ghost scare scenes. Fatso, Stinkie, and Stretch are supposed to be comic characters, and as such, they may usually not do so well, but I think they occasionally provide some amusement. Eric Idle, of Monty Python fame, plays Dibbs, and he's certainly been funnier, but his character has some good lines, such as some of the ones he says after Carrigan falls off a cliff. Also, the movie may get a bit better towards the end, with some decent excitement, as well as some rather touching moments.Overall, I think I enjoyed this movie a bit more ten years ago, so I guess it's one of those films that's more appealing to kids, despite some occasional mild language, which must be mostly what earned it its PG rating. However, it COULD appeal to some adults as well, so I won't say it's strictly for kids, though it could be fairly close. Personally, I have to give ""Casper"" an above average rating for the amount of entertainment value I found in it, even though that amount wasn't enough to make it a film I would want to watch multiple times, and quite a lot of it seemed to bore me. So, for many kids who like ghost stories, this particular ghost movie is probably enjoyable. For adults who want a family film with good special effects, this MIGHT be worth checking out, but I wouldn't watch it with expectations any higher than moderate",Casper
41,phubbs,Casper,7,28 December 2013,"I recall this film popping out of nowhere really, saw a trailer for it out of the blue, liked the look of it and went to see it. The creepy Addams Family visuals along with some really sweet looking effects hooked me and overall I really enjoyed this little kiddie flick.The plot is a simple Scooby Doo type affair really. There's a big old spooky mansion where Casper and his three uncle ghosts reside. An evil tyrannical female inherits the mansion and wants to find the treasure hidden within its bowels (then tear it down), problem is the ghosts. So she hires Bill Pullman (a paranormal therapist) and his daughter Ricci to get rid of the spooks.This being a kids flick its very predictable so I needn't tell you how things unfold. What I will say is the film is a highly enjoyable ghostie adventure with some really nice looking cobweb ridden sets, charming locations, quirky humour, acceptable performances and great CGI amazingly. The ghost effects on Casper are really nice and hold up well today. He's easily the best of the bunch visually, he looks quite realistic actually. The three naughty uncles are slightly more cartoonish looking and act so. The jokes and slapstick from them is very childish, you can see the one liners and sight gags coming a mile off but that's expected. Other ghosts that materialise during the film also look more like cartoons and not as effective as Casper, not too sure why Pullman's wife appears as a proper human though when all the others are CGI, emotional moment I guess.The other thing that impresses is how well the actors interact with the CGI spooks, believe it or not but they do look in all the right places and at the right times. You'd half expect this film to have hokey effects and badly directed live action but its really good all the way through. There are some unnecessary quickfire cameos that's for sure, the only clever one was seeing Dan Aykroyd turn up as 'Ray Stantz', I liked that.Hot on the heels of a certain Charles Addams creation Ricci follows on with her adopted kooky persona with this halloween caper, and its suits her perfectly. Pullman is a blundering but lovable father to Ricci's character whilst Casper is voiced nicely and acted well by a young Devon Sawa in human form. The only let down is the rather lame villainess and her henchman played by Eric Idle who didn't really need to be here.At times this film is actually very sweet and can bring a lump to your throat, it has that sickly sentimental touch, especially during the finale. But overall this is a great fun film if you enjoy light-hearted supernatural silliness. To sum up it isn't too far from a kids version of 'Beetlejuice' or 'High Spirits' and much better than the Eddie Murphy vehicle 'The Haunted Mansion'. 7/10",Casper
42,Mister-6,So much fun it's scary...,7,9 February 2000,"""Casper"" creates a world where ghosts can indeed live alongside mortals...even if not altogether peacefully.When Dr. Harvey (Pullman) and his daughter Kat (Ricci) are brought in to exorcise a crumbling manor of its ghosts, they not only discover the Casper of the title but also his raucous uncles, who disrupt their lives on a daily basis.The innocence of the old Harvey Comics is long gone, to be sure, but the movie does manage to capture some of the excitement and awe of the kids-and-ghosts combination, along with the Catskills-style humor of the uncles (they possess the good doctor in a series of surprising guises).But there's also the literal assignations of death, remembrances of Casper's lost childhood and the scene where the ghosts try to kill the doctor to ""make the Ghostly Trio a quartet"" that kind of put a pall on the proceedings.  Also, some language make this a questionable rental for the kiddies.However, if you're of the right age and understand about FX and things like that and can appreciate an exorcism by Father Guido Sarducci, this is the movie for you.Seven stars for ""Casper"".  Perfect for a quiet rental fright. ...er, I meant ""night"".  Sorry.",Casper

44,tbills2,"It's Casper, The Friendly Ghost!",6,18 December 2013,"Casper is such a lovely tale. I'm so thankful that in 1995 this sweet story made its way onto the big screen. It's so kind-spirited and so good! As a kid I watched Casper and was fond of it, and now some 20 years since that time, I've really come to realize and appreciate Casper for the genuinely sweet and quite precious film that it is, and you should too! It's a perfect film for kids! Casper the Ghost is so lovable! Casper the Ghost is an original and well-illustrated character to begin with, but the creative way that Casper and his ghostly friends are brought to life in this wonderfully magnificent family film is truly very special. Casper's sets and special effects are so impressive. Christina Ricci does such an incredible job as Kat. I adore her having only good things to say for the so very cute Christina. (She's so refined with her acting at a young age. She should of won the academy award!) Bill Pullman's excellent as Kat's dad, Dr. James Harvey, as he brings his real heart to the show. Casper has a beautiful, kind score. I rate Casper a 6 in critical regard but oh, big whoop! Who cares, really? What does that even matter? Casper is an all out 10 in all of the good ways that count, and that's what matters! An unforgettable, all-time 10, I love! Casper is sooo sweeeet!",Casper
45,mitsubishizero,I couldn't get into it.,4,20 April 2019,"I remember watching this as a kid and needless to say I didn't even get far. The characters look cool but and the story's not bad but I couldn't really get into it. The story's about the titular character(Malachi Pearson) who lives with his obnoxious, cruel uncles Fatso, Stretch and Stinky(Joe Alaskey, Jon Nipote,Brad Garrett). Tired of them and wanting a friend he tricks a Ghost Therapist named Dr. James Harvey into visiting his mansion knowing that he'll bring his daughter Kat Harvey(Christina Riccie).Kat and James have a strained relationship due to James' wife's death and his obsession with contacting her from the afterlife. Unbeknownst to them she became an angel rather than a ghost. Shortly after they arrive they the ghostly trio do their best to scare them out which backfires big time. Things start off rocky after they move in but the trio begins to bond with James after realizing why he's here. Meanwhile Kat becomes popular at school and plans on hosting a party at her mansion much to her rival's disappointment leading her and her boyfriend to try and sabotage it.Slowly and slowly Casper and Kat begin to bond with eachother leading to a creepy scene where he whispers if he can ""keep"" her. The movie's not bad as there's creativity but many of the jokes aren't really funny. They just come and go and leave you hollow inside. The characters are ok. Casper's likable as usual and the Harvey's are likable even Kat who's cynical but you understand why but the uncles are so obnoxious. I get they're misanthropic ghosts but man they're annoying. It's not really a story you can get invested to.Bottomline this's a movie worth passing.",Casper
46,bellino-angelo2014,A great family movie that is also quite touching,8,22 February 2021,"I used to watch this movie lots of times during my childhood. Now, I rewatched after many years on the day of my 22nd birthday (January 6) and I had fond memories of it. I think it's much better than its IMDB score might suggest.The movie begins with a young couple that wants to buy a house but after a while they escape because of a young ghost named Casper that frightens everyone to death. After a while an expert on the afterlife and her daughter (Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci) buy the house and Pullman wants to find out the haunting spirits that haunt that home. After Casper appears the girl is frightened at first but after a few hours they become friends and the girl understands that Casper used to behave that way because he needed a friend since he was all alone by himself in that mansion and his uncles always mistreated him. Casper would help the girl in finding a boy for the school ball and even in meeting for a few minutes her dead mother and they become friends forever and share the mansion.I do think it's an underrated family movie because many viewers expected to watch a copy of GHOSTBUSTERS or GHOST (the Demi Moore movie) but it's not like those other movies. It's profound and touching because Casper always wanted a real friend to play with and be accepted for what he was. It gives a nice message about friendship.Don't believe most of the reviews in this site because I think this is one of those underrated family movies from the 1990s (along with DENNIS THE MENACE or BABY'S DAY OUT) that can be enjoyed and loved by both kids and adults because of their characters and very familiar situations. Believe me, there are very worst family movies out there such as BABY GENIUSES 1 and 2, SON OF THE MASK, the ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS movies, JINGLE ALL THE WAY and JACK FROST!!!! So, don't be afraid to buck conventional wisdom because you miss a lot, and let me say it, they don't make family movies like this one anymore!",Casper

This film does not strive to be a particular good film, but it is enjoyable all the same. I watched it as a young adult, and the film was enjoyable and innocent. It's not a frightening film, but it's a film about friendship and understanding. It also had the humor element common in films for young adults. The other ghost characters provide this humor.This film is done well, and it is packed with action but also leaves room for the morales and patience in making friendships and learning how to understand different people or points of view.Young adults (aged 8-15) would probably enjoy this film more than any other audience.",Casper

It makes me laugh, cry, and excited! i am disappointed that so many people don't like this movie. it is an all-time favorite of mine. It is sad yes, but it has comic relief from the three uncles that try to be humanlike, Casper, the friendly ghost that knows what it is like to be lonely, for instance me, and same with Kat. I am very touched with this film, for it makes me think about me, lonely and depressed, but it has a positive ending which I really adored! i also liked the amazing effects, that were famous at its, time. Of course now, effects from movies are like The Matrix films and LOTR, but i mainly like this film, because it tocuhes my heart in a both sad and sometimes happy, knowing, someone else is out there for you, even if you are a bit...dead. 10/10",Casper

52,Min111,He's a friendly ghost,5,12 August 2020,"It's the original film. Casper is a friendly ghost who lives in a mansion. He wishes to find a friend. The mansion happens to be haunted by ghosts. One of the ghosts happens to be Casper. The other ghosts happen to be his uncles named Fatso, Stinkie and Stretch. They're funny! They are ""The Ghostly Trio"". Stretch is the leader. Later, they happen to get along with one of the characters named Dr Harvey who along with his daughter, Kat, move into the haunted mansion. Casper and Kat soon become friends. Casper has a crush on her by the way. There's another character named Catherine who is a wicked woman that discovers that the mansion has treasures. She immediately hires Dr Harvey to get rid of these ghosts in order for her to get the treasure. There happens to be treasure, but you'd be surprised what the treasure is. You need to see it to find out. Let's not forget another character named Paul who is Catherine's assistant. He's funny! There are other characters such as Amber and Vic who are Kat's school mates. Kat and Amber don't see eye to eye, and Vic is someone Kat has a crush on. During the Halloween party, The Ghostly Trio (Fatso, Stinkie and Stretch) scare them away. I found that funny. I didn't like Amber and Vic, and they deserve what they got. The thing that interests me the most is the cameo appearance of one of the ""Ghostbusters"" named Ray. I liked that, and thought that was very clever by having one of them to get rid of these ghosts. Even he was afraid of the ghosts inside the mansion, and can't get rid of them. That was hilarious! He's suppose to be a ""Ghostbuster"" by the way. It's his expertise. I'm happy he appeared. Casper is funny! It's a comedy film, and a film for the entire family to see. I wish I had someone or anyone like Casper as a friend. Casper only wants someone to play with. I think that's cute. I like Casper.",Casper
53,meydiana-65242,Great Movie With Various Perspectives,10,31 March 2021,"Great Movie With Various Perspectives
After reading the comments, I see most people enjoy this movie with a few picking it over nothing (e.g. Not an accurate portrait of ghost?). I first saw the movie in my preteen. It was a fun & 'cute' movie, highly entertaining with the trio & treasure hunting & stuff.As I grew older & revisit this movie, I see more 'layers' of the movie other than a 'kiddie ghost story'. Dr. Harvey (Bill Pullman, excellent as usual) is having a hard time dealing with the death of his wife, & Kat (Ricci, a great break from the cool-headed Wednesday Adams) is having a hard time adjusting her father's constant move as well as grieving her mother on her own. Then, there is Casper grieving his own death as well as his father's death. And then there is Carrigan's mourning her father... not leaving her all the riches. Then there is Casper's heroic act (go see the movie, it's one of the most touching moment), Dr. Harvey's reunion, etc. Etc.From a child's point of view, it's pure entertainment. From an art lover's point of view, you have to awe at the special effect & sets. From an audience seeking emotional outlet, well, bring in an extra box of kleenex. It's a very touching, warm-hearted, humorous, sweet little movie about a friendly ghost named Casper.Just a side note, it is quite interesting to watch Addams' Family & Casper & Sleepy Hollow & see Christina Ricci grow from the eccentric Wednesday Addams to a regular teenager Kat Harvey to a beautiful young lady Katrina Van Tessel.",Casper
54,cardsrock,"A bit hokey, but has some deep messages",6,30 October 2020,"Casper is a pretty goofy, lighthearted movie that has a dark edge to it. It can be a little depressing for a kids movie, however that can make it more watchable for adults. The computer animation is very impressive for 1995 and James Horner has a reliably strong score. Casper isn't the best Halloween movie out there, but it can provide some decent entertainment.",Casper
55,baileycrawly,Fantastic,9,8 September 2020,"Casper is an absolute classic. It's a charming kid's movie full of mildly startling images and exciting adventure, but it's so much more than that. It's a very mature film and takes a very candid look at the losses we experience in life. It doesn't let the children and family film label stop itself from being both tragic and heartwarming simultaneously.Leading the cast you've got Bill Pullman as paranormal investigator Dr. Harvey and the fabulous Christina Rocco as his daughter, Kat. After the death of his wife, Harvey has been moving from place to place in an effort to make contact with his deceased wife to help her resolve any ""unfinished business"" she may have. Then, you've got Cathy Moriarty as the delightfully diabolical Carrigan, who inherits Whipstaff Manor, and the hilarious Eric Idle as her bumbling sidekick, Dibs. Together, they create a truly menacing and intimidating duo, even more so as the film progresses. Then, Joe Niptoe, Joe Alaskey and Brad Garrett as the digitally rendered ""Ghostly Trio"" are fantastic, hitting every note exactly when they needed to. Lastly, and perhaps most important, is Malachi Pearson and Devon Sawa in the role of Casper, a character who, despite being well-known long before this film came out, is given just the right amount of time to develop his character throughout the film, making him a highly lovable character that's easy to sympathize with.Growing up, Casper was a love/hate movie for me because, as much as I adored every second of the film, it was the creepiest of the family-friendly Halloween movies I had seen. To this day, the great animation on the ghosts and the overall tone of the film are still a little creepy, but in a good way.It's hard to tell just why Casper got the negativity it did, because it really is a fantastic adaptation that's held up extremely well over the years.",Casper

The joke is that up until this point the good doctor had never actually encountered a ghost before. Kat and Casper become friends while the doctor tries to work on the three other ghosts to help them move on. It is discovered that there is a treasure hidden within the walls of Whipstaff and the rightful owner of the house, a ""delightful"" woman named Carrigan wants it and nothing will stop her from getting it, not even murder.This is a delightful film that is suitable for most ages. This movie was the first to use CGI for a leading character and for the most part that animation holds up. I have watched this quite a few times and always enjoy it. I do not understand the low rating here.",Casper
57,lagudafuad,"A nice, likable movie for all",6,3 January 2013,"Casper is a movie that I enjoy watching over again even after 17 years this 1995 movie is very impressive, the acting and performance that both Pullman and Ricci pulled off is one that I sure admire, as both actors had to act without anything being there, as the ghosts were CGI effects added after filming, so when this two act scared and are talking, there were doing it talking to just air.The movie is interesting and likable, the plot holes are very obvious, with the whole crossing over thing, but the movie production is good enough to make you ignore the plot holes.The movie is based on a Children's book titled: The Friendly Ghost released in 1939 and an animated series done in 1945. It is directed by Brad Siberling who did a moderately good job here and who went ahead to direct City of Angels (1998) which was also not well received and Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004).The movie plot starts with the antagonist Carrigan discovering that her late father willed to her an abandoned house. This made her furious cause all she wanted were his money. While disposing of the papers to the house she discovered a paper saying that there is a treasure hidden in the house.She, now ready to get the treasure goes to the house only to discover that it is being haunted by 4 ghosts, so she hired Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) to help exorcise the ghost. James moved into the house, with her daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) although James has experience dealing with ghost he has not actually seen one, so both he and his daughter were scared to bits when they moved in.They soon discovered to among the 4 ghost that there is a friendly one named Casper. With Carrigan deadline approaching James is stuck with the task of getting rid of the Ghost who seemed to be rather enjoying their haunted house.Casper was a huge commercial success bringing in way over 280 million from its 55 million production cost, but the movie didn't receive good reviews, holding a 44% approval rating from critics in rotten tomatoes. The movie's down side is the role of the antagonist Carrigan (played by Cathy Moriarty), she seemed viciously stupid, the writers made her money hungry which in turn made her throw it all away just to get a treasure box, a treasure box that she did not know what it contained.Putting it all together, this is a nice DVD to own. Casper had two sequels (that I know off) Casper: A Spirited Beginning (1997) and Casper meets Wendy (1998). The sequels featured new people, but the ghosts Casper, Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso all were present in the sequels Cathy Moriarty who played Carrigan in this movie was also in Casper meets Wendy in the movie she plays the head witch. None of the sequels are anywhere as good as this original, so don't even bother.www.lagsreviews.com",Casper

Little do they Know that the house they moved into has a friendly ghost named Casper. The house is also being over run by SNOOTY rich girl Carrigan Crittendon played by Cathy Moriarty and her assistant Dibs played By Eric Idle who want the fortune in the house.This movie works in so many ways because I think it appeals more to adults than to kids.

In this case, he brings the story of Casper to life in an impressive way. This is one fun film from start to finish.There isn't much to the story, especially in the first half, but this is where it is the most fun. The nicely thought out dialogue and the funny antics of the ghostly trio, Stretch, Stinkie, and Fatso, all keep this picture highly entertaining. The second half of this 100 minute film slows down just a bit to get more story going. At this point the ghostly trio are a little less involved and Casper takes the stage.The CG is outstanding. I know the ghosts look all cartoony, but this is a childish film. Anyhow, they look great. The voice acting is also spot on. Joe Nipote, Joe Alaskey, and Brad Garrett match wonderfully to their ghost characters. Malachi Pearson is also a solid Casper.All the actors for the human characters are magnificently cast as well.

I thought I'd give it another try, and I am glad I did. This is a superior family film and has that rare quality that too many films that claim to be family films lack: it appeals to both kids and adults. One word of caution to parents: this movie does contain supernatural themes (as you would expect) and does deal with death too. I know that won't worry a lot of people and I am one of them, but I make the point for those parents who may find this a concern. You have been warned.That being said, this movie is a lot of fun. Kids will love the antics of Casper and his comical cohorts, The Ghostly Trio. Adults will love the cameos in the early part of the movie, especially a deliciously clever one by Dan Ackroyd. They will also appreciate the fact that this movie is faithful to the characters they may have grown up with and remember fondly. The special effects are good, the script is intelligent and the movie boasts a cast of excellent actors who are obviously enjoying themselves, including Christina Ricci and Bill Pullman in central roles, Cathy Moriarty and Eric Idle who are terrific as the villains of the piece, and a capable group of voice actors for Casper and The Ghostly Trio, including Brad Garrett of 'Everybody Loves Raymond' fame. The only criticism I would make of this movie, if I was to make any, is that there are a lot of subplots involved and not all of them are fully resolved, but that's only a minor beef. The movie is really so much fun you probably only notice this on subsequent viewings. The kids won't notice it at all. Yes, this is definitely a very good movie and I'm happy to recommend it for young and old.",Casper
69,RhapsodyReviews,Better as a Child.,4,28 October 2019,"Review:
'Casper' is a family-comedy-drama film directed by Brad Silberling. It is based on the Harvey Comics cartoon character Casper the Friendly Ghost created by Seymour Reit and Joe Oriolo.
I was excited to show this movie to my son because from what I remembered I loved it as a kid. Sadly, seeing it as an adult, it doesn't hold up as well.
Furious that her late father only willed her his gloomy-looking mansion rather than his millions, Carrigan Crittenden (Cathy Moriarty) is ready to burn the place to the ground when she discovers a map to a treasure hidden in the house. But when she enters the rickety mansion to seek her claim, she is frightened away by a wicked wave of ghosts. Determined to get her hands on this hidden fortune, she hires afterlife therapist Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) to exorcise the ghosts from the mansion. Harvey and his daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) move in, and soon Kat meets Casper, the ghost of a young boy who's ""the friendliest ghost you know.""
Christina Ricci shines as the stressed and lonely teen who is looking for a friend, and so does Bill Pullman, as an unconventional Psychologist looking for spirits with ""unfinished business"". Sadly, these two performances are the only one's worth noting, everybody else in the movie stinks.
This movie isn't all bad, but there is very little good about it. It has a bit of language that isn't suitable for young kids, and I almost wanted to stop my son from watching it, but it's also not entertaining enough to keep adults invested in the story.
Overall, if you seen this movie as a child, keep it that way. It doesn't hold up today and you see things differently through eyes of an adult.

You do not even see the grace of this film, as you are The neurotic, that's disgusting. beautiful film. As to the usual one, the usual negative comments which talk about a classical film some years 80 which everyone does not like it to the nostalgic ones are met.Sure Heros that this film had to have a judgment in this site. In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is ""better"" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated. Good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers. Better think separately with its head. I was sure that the god fun old episode did not like it. Who has to be withdrawn is not george lucas but the last reviewer Leanne littrell GO AWAY.",Casper
73,srmccarthy,The ending is the ONLY good moment!,6,29 July 2001,"I would rate this movie below average, IF NOT for the ending!!!

74,n-mo,"Vastly underrated, highly enjoyable family film",8,27 May 2016,"There's a lot to like in ""Casper."" Though the plot centered around early teenager Kat Harvey is fairly conventional and formulaic, the film makes up for it with fairly meaty side plots, solid dialogue and acting and special effects that are unpretentious yet perfectly executed and more than adequate for suspension of disbelief.A lot of people disliked this film or thought it unsuitable for children. I guess nowadays people tend to view death as not a ""kid"" subject, a curious point of view considering its ubiquity. ""Casper"" works as a fantasy-spook comedy because it does not pretend to some sort of ""realistic"" conception of life after death: it plays off folkish notions inherited from religion, myth and popular legend and offers its own spin that can be viewed as deeply or as lightly as one wishes. Along the way the film hints at potential resolutions for so many of the philosophical and existential conflicts that have puzzled great thinkers for ages: free will vs. destiny, suffering for good vs. reward for evil, temporal vs. eternal, the pain of loss and the need to live.To wit, it's fun and largely free of the worst sorts of vulgarities that plague so many movies of this sort. I would say it's more appropriate as a ""family"" centerpiece than as sleepover fare, but hardly inadequate for children whose parents have strong convictions and can answer the tough questions that may follow.",Casper
75,Rumples,Family Movie???,7,23 November 1998,"Well, it's cute and reasonably inoffensive. I am not sure that adults would find it appealing being fairly trite, teenagers would likely be nauseated by it, and little kids may not find the subject matter conducive to freedom from nightmares. Nevertheless, a nice enough effort.",Casper
76,xherridea,Nostalgic,6,14 July 2020,"I liked this film a lot a young kid, and it's still comforting to me now. It's very 90s, it's cheesy and it's predictable. Even so, I think there's something to like here. I like the score of the film. I think that the characters are charming, especially the ghosts. It feels heartfelt, whether or not it is, I cannot say. I also really enjoyed the villains and the humour of the film, that's subjective so I know it won't be for everyone. I think it's a pleasant family film that hasn't aged that badly since it's creation.",Casper
77,benjaminwest-242,A solid movie for kids,5,20 October 2021,"Casper is a decent film. The CGI of the ghosts are well-done, which assists the average comedic efforts attempted in some scenes. The emotional depth has value, as well. Unfortunately, the film feels rushed, with missing scenes and dialogue that would have crafted a more complete story. The ending also was somewhat cringey, although some parts are satisfying to the overall plot line. Overall, an enjoyable experience for likely children only.",Casper

Kat and her farther Dr. James Harvey are living the life of a paranormal therapist, in which they are never in one place too long until they move into the Whipstaff Manor. There they become friendly with Casper and his three unfriendly obnoxious uncles Fatso, Stretch & Stinkie. The story unravels and you begin to like Casper more and more. Kat becomes very close with Casper and discovers a newspaper article that describes how Casper's heartbroken father created a machine called the Lazarus designed to resurrect his dead son.

The only thing standing in their way is the ghosts that haunt the place. Enter Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) and his daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) to exterminate the spooks.The movie isn't perfect. The story lacks direction, the serious questions about death often undermine the charm and the final scene drags on but the film certainly has it's moments. The cast performs admirably with a nice series of cameos from the likes of Dan Aykroyd, Rodney Dangerfield and even Clint Eastwood. The best performance goes to Eric Idle as the weaselly henchman, Dibbs who quite literally goes out with a bang. In all, an enjoyable if somewhat empty film.If nothing else, ""Casper"" has the distinction of being the only film ever to feature both Mr. Rogers and The Cryptkeeper.",Casper

And of course there are some swearing words that you may find in a family movie that's rated ""PG"" including many pop culture references (along with a Ghostbusters reference and featuring an uncredited Dan Aykroyd cameo) that was made in the '90s at that time considered Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver wrote the screenplay for this, plus the story is remarkable, adorable and humorous; and discovering how Casper died in the first place, the sets are very decent, the effects for the ghosts are very impressive since this was wouldn't have been rereleased as a 3D movie nowadays, the characters are remarkable, the music score by the late and great James Horner is mysterious, beautiful and breathtaking, plus there are also some scenes that are tear-jerking to hilarious which are and some scenes that are mature, gross and a little scary for young audiences including the scene where Carrigan was in her Ghost Form. Plus I recommend checking this film to watch around Halloween and those who are fans of Casper the friendly ghost both young and old and it's yet to become a Halloween classic and it's truly everyone's favorite movie from their childhood to watch around the Halloween season.",Casper

84,jwayne_24,More Heartfelt than one might expect,8,25 July 2015,"I recently re-watched this and despite the fact that its been 20 years since I originally watched this a young kid, I still loved it immensely.The story is fairly simple: a rich, hateful woman inherits a house and hopes to find treasure hidden to get rich quick. She is scared away by Casper the friendly ghost and his three uncles, who are not so friendly.So she hires a psychiatrist, Dr. James Harvey, to exorcise the ghosts. He moves in with his young daughter Kat, who still misses her mother greatly. She is scared at first, but quickly befriends Casper.Watching this movie with a friend was emotional due to the fact that he had lost his wife about 2 years prior to this film being released, so the scenes toward the end with the spirit of Dr. Harvey's wife and Casper, and then her spirit and Dr. Harvey were bittersweet and a little close to home.This was a very good, enjoyable film, and this is coming from someone who also loved the cartoon as a kid. My grade: B.",Casper

86,aaronmocksing1987,Makes the later sequels look like Ed Wood films,10,18 May 2008,"I saw this when I was very young, about 8 or so, back in the movie theaters. I didn't know who Casper was until I got older (not sure, it might have been before that) and my mom bought a couple old VHS's containing cartoon classics. A few noticeable Casper ones were in it, even in better quality than they are in now on DVD dollar bin collections. Christina Ricci's performance was amazing, as is Pullman, the voice actors of Casper and the Ghostly Trio.Shame the sequels couldn't learn from this movie over time, because it seems like they've been trying to ruin the spirit (no pun intended) of this film. Cash-ins, anyone? For any Ghostbuster fan, you might like seeing Dr. Ray Stantz popping out of nowhere either towards the beginning.",Casper
87,crazychap,A highly memorable film,8,1 June 2005,"I remember when this movie came out in the summer of 1995. I recall, being 10 at the time, pressing my Mum and Dad to take me to the movies the very day it came out-- it was late July-- , and we had to wait in a long queue (short in comparison with the recent Star Wars films) that lasted an hour. Although my Dad didn't like it, I was fascinated by it, since I loved the old cartoon series of the 60s and 70s. I also remember being emotional-- I literally jumped up when the 3 Ghosts and Casper made their debut on the screen. I also cried when they talked about loss, such as the death of Jamers Harvey's wife, and so forth. Enough with the details, I can say that the movie was very good, not because that is based on a cartoon that I love, but because it has a good combination of an effective story, great special effects (a jump up from Rogger Rabbit's combination of animation and live-action) as well as great performances from the leading cast. Christina Ricci shines as the stressed and lonely teen Kat Harvey looking for a friend, and so does Bill Pullman, who plays Dr. James Harvey, an unconventional Psychologist looking for ""spirits with unfinished business"", and believes that his late wife Emilia is one. Cathy Moriarty, who plays Carrigan, a strong-willed woman who tries to snatch a treasure in the abandoned Whipstaff manor in Maine-- and the home of the 4 Ghosts and the previous two humans-- is a riot. Eric Idle, her easy-going partner-in-slime also shines with a role he undoubtedly played before in the many sketches of Monty Python. The music score, in particular the Casper theme song ""One Last Wish"", is the one chord that struck me really hard , it makes me cry every time I hear it and gives me a strong sense of affection every time I see this movie.But there are still a few flaws: First, the movie's pace is uneven, starting off with a perfect grabber, only to slow down to a crawl near halfway and then getting some momentum in the second half. Second, there are some scenes (such as Fatso kissing Bill Pullman as a Fake Emilia) that come and go without any meaning, so they have no reason for being there in the first place. Third, most of the supporting characters--including the jealous two ""friends""-- are basically decoration sets, with also little relevance to the plot.But nevertheless, Casper's strengths manages to overpower its weaknesses, and in the end, it leaves both something for people to talk about and be entertained at the same time. Highly recommended for kids and adults alike.",Casper

89,TransAtlantyk,"Enjoyable for the children, watchable for the adults.",6,11 January 2012,"Casper is one of those films that was clearly made with the children in mind. The plot holes are huge, the idea is ridiculous, and the movie is pretty sloppily arranged. That said, kids do not focus on those things. They will be fascinated with the idea of the friendly ghost and his interactions with the family living in their house. The Ghostly Trio are an extremely annoying collection of characters but the rest of the cast does quite well. Bill Pullman is fun enough to watch as the paranormal psychiatrist and Christina Ricci as his daughter is great.This is a good movie to watch around Halloween time with the kids. It is tame enough that they won't be frightened but at the same time it has a very gloomy/autumn feel to help add to the Halloween season. Grab your candy corn and watch this one with your kid. But make sure they brush their teeth, dental bills add up.",Casper

Wow, it all came back to me how much I loved this movie.Casper himself is played as a lot little boy, very real and unsure of himself at the age of 12.  He falls in love with Kat in such an innocent way that it's touching.  And when he says as she falls asleep, ""Can I keep you?"" I start to cry. His speech about his death would make a great short acting monolouge.Kat is a smartass and highly intelligent, showing Christina Ricci as the funny, witty, and all-around cool actress she is.  Her portrayal of Kat is reminisent of a similar movie that came earlier...Winona Rider as Lydia in ""Beetlejuice"" without the fascination with death.Of course, Bill Pullman is great in whatever he does, but here you just wanna wrap the poor guy up in a hug.  And his dynamic with the FANTASTIC Ghostly Trio pretty much makes most of the movie sparkle.What could've been a sappy ending is done with such magic.  A 17-year-old Devon Sawa in one of his first roles walks down the stairs and extends his hand to Kat with such perfect love and tenderness.  And I cheer when the FINALLY kiss.  He looks like such an angel.All around, a great movie.  Funny, romantic, the perfect blend of sappyness and sentimentality that MAKES for a tear-jerker ending.  Great job!",Casper

We live in a historical period of apathy and love for cinema, good part of American films rely on special effects and little plot. This film is an excellent film for children, I like and I am in VHS cassette.

If you watch the news and read the papers every day like I do, it gets to you after a while...the young soldiers being killed in Iraq, all the election BS that we are being bombarded with right now...all or most of the news is downright depressing. That creates an important place for a movie like this...one that can make your life a little less serious for a while. I've always been a Christina Ricci fan, going back to the Addams Family when she was only 11 years old. She was a great actress even at that young age. You could tell that she would go far as an actress. The personality was there...it set her apart from her peers. At the age of 15, she continues to do a great job in Casper...she is very believable. Sometimes, in this troubled world where violence and negative things seem to be the norm, a nice little movie like this can go a long way toward making your day a little brighter.

UNfortunately, Christina Ricci, the chick that plays Kat, lived a different acting life and it seems that as soon as it became legal, she started heading for the 'adult' sextion movies. It just makes you wonder where some people go in life. The movie is really great though, the machine that grooms the people at the start of the day is great and the potion to turn somebody from a ghost to a human was also pretty neat. I like the part in the beginning the most where the whole gang is around the breakfast table and they are all getting to know each other better... the ghosts don't even seem to have a real problem with the fact that other people are living in their house... if I could, I would live in that house with those 3 wacky ghosts for a week, but it seems the only thing I would be around would be dust and an old rusty mansion. 9/10",Casper

Listening to the beautiful piano music in the background certainly doesn't help with the tears!!! It gives me all different kinds of emotions. I love the deeper meaning behind the movie.

103,snowravyn,Great Movie With Various Perspectives,10,14 June 2002,"After reading the comments, I see most people enjoy this movie with a few picking it over nothing (e.g. not an accurate portrait of ghost?).  I first saw the movie in my preteen.  It was a fun & 'cute' movie, highly entertaining with the trio & treasure hunting & stuff.As I grew older & revisit this movie, I see more 'layers' of the movie other than a 'kiddie ghost story'.  Dr. Harvey (Bill Pullman, excellent as usual) is having a hard time dealing with the death of his wife, & Kat (Ricci, a great break from the cool-headed Wednesday Adams) is having a hard time adjusting her father's constant move as well as grieving her mother on her own.  Then, there is Casper grieving his own death as well as his father's death.  And then there is Carrigan's mourning her father... not leaving her all the riches.  Then there is Casper's heroic act (go see the movie, it's one of the most touching moment), Dr. Harvey's reunion, etc. etc.From a child's point of view, it's pure entertainment.  From an art lover's point of view, you have to awe at the special effect & sets.  From an audience seeking emotional outlet, well, bring in an extra box of kleenex. It's a very touching, warm-hearted, humorous, sweet little movie about a friendly ghost named Casper.Just a side note, it is quite interesting to watch Addams' Family & Casper & Sleepy Hollow & see Christina Ricci grow from the eccentric Wednesday Addams to a regular teenager Kat Harvey to a beautiful young lady Katrina Van Tessel.",Casper

It's pretty beautiful as a live-action adaptation of a pretty silly comic, but then it kind of shoots itself in the foot with a moral. I'm not one that believes that every movie must have a good message, but I would be wary to show this movie to my children. I love a good ghost story, but I'm not sure about a movie that questions the finality of death. One of the latter plot points of this movie is the death of the little girl's father, which in itself is fine plot material since many children deal with the death of a parent. At the end of the movie (and I don't consider this a spoiler because the main plot is what happens between Casper and Christina Ricci's character) they find a way to bring him back to life. I'm not sure what this is saying to kids about life and death. I don't think I'm over-analyzing the film because children are impressionable. I'm not sure if the film's themes are really appropriate for children's cinema.",Casper

It was one of my favorite childhood movies that I lost for many years.Casper is basically a really really sad romantic comedy for kids. Sounds like it'd be cheesy, but the comedy is distinct from the emotional bits so it's not a jumbled mess. The actors are good enough to make you give it a chance, and it just takes you from there.Casper might just be the most relatable character in film. How can't you like him?

It is fun, funny, and will bring tears to your eyes as it overflows with innocent romance and love. It amazes me how so much garbage that comes out of Hollywood, unwatchable garbage like ""Avatar"" and all those super hero movies, yet this masterpiece of writing,acting and special effects is shunned. There are many good reviews so I shall keep it short. A teen girl moves with her ""ghost Psychologist"" father to a haunted house to clear it out for a price. Casper lives there and is a sweet ghost and former 12 year old boy, now turned ghost. His fun and crazy three ghost ""uncles"" live there too and havoc ensues. The evil owner and her hilarious personal secretary (Eric Idle of Monty Python) are the real trouble makers. The friendship and romance between Ricci and ""Casper"" is perfect. The line that breaks my heart is when Kat (Ricci) is falling asleep and Casper cuddles up and says ""Can I keep you""? It is a perfect motion picture and I watch it 5-6 times a year.

112,gamisan,NOT appropriate for small children,2,27 June 2010,"I'm really surprised by the positive reviews for Casper, because my reaction to it was really negative, especially as a film for family viewing. I'm not against dark movies for children, especially if they help to frame difficult things in simple terms - I think films like The Iron Giant or a Nightmare Before Christmas are healthy viewing for even younger children (say 4 & up. Casper, however, really struck me a being wide of the mark for a family audience, as it doesn't appear that children were really taken into account much when the film was made.This movie may be fine for older children and adults, but please heed the PG rating - there is a great deal of smoking in the movie, and quite a bit of language and humor that is far too adult for small children. It resembled to me more of a poor remake of Ghostbusters, rather than an honest-to-goodness family film. The special effects skew toward the disturbing side, the humor is mostly violent slapstick, the subtext is desperately creepy, and the casual attitude towards suicide, murder and death is really, really inappropriate. Definitely a movie I wish my child had never seen.",Casper

This movie does a good job clenching the issue of death and either letting it go and hang onto it as a ghost with unfinished business. The atmosphere, although often times comical (which is how it is with the cartoons too XD), has a really deep and emotional air to it, as we look at Dr. Harvey and Kat's loss at the wife/mother's death, as well as Casper's mourning for his life and loneliness as a ghost. The music itself is very beautiful, and the set gives a perfect background for both spooky and sentimental moments. If you're one who is looking for a good emotional ghost story, this is a great example, even though it was based on a cartoon. If you're looking for something comical, well, the three ghosts Stretch, Fatso, and Stinky are there to provide laughs, as they really do seem to be having a ball being floating ethereal beings capable of shifting themselves into horrific (and hilarious) shapes.I don't remember much from the Casper cartoons, but it's not like you can totally base an entire movie on just those. The plots for the cartoons vary, and this movie could be counted as some sort of canon, I suppose. Either way, it does a good job capturing the lonely, friendly ghost that is Casper on the big screen (and TV set).Go ahead and rent the movie; I'm looking forward to searching for a DVD for it so I can watch it again and again. I love it. I totally recommend this for everyone, kids and grownups alike.",Casper
114,johnbd90,Decent movie for a well know character.,7,16 January 2018,"Its a 90s movie, so there is a lot of nostalgia built around it, which does mean its going to be overated by some people.
Never the less its a decent movie worth your time and here is why.Pros: 
-There is a comedic element, nothing groundbreaking. I would describe it as Bugs bunny like comedy.
You do get to meet /understand the characters and empathise with Casper.The story is pretty straight forward except for some small plot and twists here and there. If you have kids they ll propably like its simplicity.There are unique sets and scenery , especially the artistic architecture of the main set. Not my thing but the effort is appreciated .The story leaves you with wanting more about what happened after the epilogue. Which is positive to my perspective. I dont want to know more of a story I didnt find engaging.The soundtract ,especially the piano song by James Horner- Caspers lullaby is unbelievably beautiful. A movie with a great soundtrack always scores higher in my book.Christina Ricci was lovely ,once again.Cons:
The story is rushed in the 20 last minutes of the movie. I understand the need to make 1:30 mins movies for the sake of short attention spans and cinema theaters but I cant but to imagine how good this movie would be if they took their time and move things organically.The movie itself is great and it doesnt let you down even after 2 decades since it was released but I find it kinda corny at some points, nothing annoying but I had to share that.Bill Pulmans performance was mediocre at certain points.Anyways, enjoy this one. I know I always will.",Casper
115,karalyeva,Great movie for adults and OLDER kids,8,31 October 2006,"We picked this movie out to show to our kindergarten and 1st-graders at the after school care program I work at. Neither my coworker nor I had seen the movie for a long time, but remembered it being quite innocuous, and entertaining for kids. We started the movie and immediately saw why it was so entertaining. There are a great number of pop-culture references (Father Guido Sarducci makes an appearance as an exorcist, and subsequently comes out of the house with pea soup on his robe and his head turned all the way around, a reference to The Exorcist) and very witty dialogue. My coworker and I were in stitches with things that just completely went over the kids' heads. It is a very, very well-done movie, even more than I had remembered as I child.Now, for the other part. We made a big mistake showing this to our kindergarteners and 1st-graders. There is quite a bit of swearing in this movie (not BAD bad words, but they use ""damn"" quite a lot, they used the word ""bitch"" twice, ""piss"", ""crap"" etc.), and my coworker and I were worried that the kids were hearing this stuff at their age, we were scared that they were going to go home and repeat these words at the dinner table! I think this movie is great for older kids, as it is witty, funny, sweet and charming, just like a kids' movie should be, but if you have a 5-year-old, I would advise waiting on this one if you don't want him learning swear words so young :)",Casper
116,speedr-2,Cool Movie,10,13 October 1998,"This was a pretty nice movie with a lot of special effects, and especially the song ""remember me this way""...we love that song...:)  if you haven't seen the movie...you should",Casper
117,faggitwithcheese,One of the most well-directed kids movies I've ever seen,10,15 October 2008,"It's a gem. I remember watching it almost on the loop as a kid, but I caught it on TV a week ago. The film is astounding. As a comedy, it works in deft subtle ways with a deftly written script, working with both witty dialog and fantastic cartoony sequences. As an adaptation of a comic book, it gets the spirit of the characters just right. As a family movie, it entertains people of all ages and respects them all, and addresses important issues about families that experience loss. From a technological standpoint, it created brand new technology, ran far with it, and still looks impressive and subtle. And as a drama, it works especially well with believable performances and haunting undertones about death that the entire cast and crew clearly took seriously. The movie works well on every level, and is even more satisfying than when I was a kid. The director knew exactly what he was doing, the acting is incredible, it's a great comedy, drama, and adventure. I'm sure your family will love it.",Casper
118,jElyott,One of the best!,8,13 February 2012,"Some may think I'm silly for rating this movie so highly, but I'm not. You're all silly for rating this movie as something made for adults, which is the only explanation for why this is sitting on a rating of 5.7/10I suppose technically this is a ""Family"" movie, but I think we can all agree that it's a movie made primarily for children to enjoy, so it should be rated as such. For a movie made for children to enjoy, this has got to be one of the best. It's an interesting story, with some fantastic actors, especially Bill Pullman. The love and friendship between Casper and Cat is heart warming and beautiful, and the 3 ghosts that like to cause trouble for the sake of fun are just that! FUN! There is plenty of imagination in this movie which still excites me to this day.Are there flaws? Yes, there's plenty of them, like there is in nearly ALL family films. Youngsters don't notice or even care about them, and speaking as a 19, going on 20 year old who adored this movie during my childhood, and who loves smartly written movies that make you think, I can still appreciate this movie as much as I did when I was a young boy.If this was a movie made for adults, then I agree, 5.7/10 would be a fair rating. But it isn't, it's a film made for kids to enjoy, and as such, I rate it 8/10 since I personally enjoyed it much more than most other kids movies.Also, Casper is the worlds first CGI lead character in a movie. That's pretty darn cool from a technical standpoint.",Casper
119,frey-rebecca27,Childhood Memories Revisited,8,10 December 2012,"As a child there were few movies that I enjoyed watching over and over again, but once in a while there was that one movie that just impacted me. Casper is one of those movies...the acting may not be the best and many may have taken the movie too seriously upon seeing the reviews. But the overall message and story of Casper is wonderful, and I want my children to be able to watch this someday and enjoy it as much as I certainly have. Thank you Bill Pullman for once again putting your style into such a unique and fun movie. Plus I get a kick out of the one guy with the monotone voice who was in the eye-drop commercials every time, forgive me I am too lazy to look up his name.",Casper

121,jessicalb12,Favorite Halloween Movie,10,31 October 2021,Growing up I loved this movie. Gives me all the fond memories I had from my childhood! Definitely a family Halloween movie great for kids of all ages!,Casper
122,tcerame,Overall impression,10,26 February 2017,"Casper is a most heartwarming, endearing and beautiful film, especially Christina Ricci. Casper the movie is well written combining a love story, comedy and drama. Although Casper is a ghost in the finale the love given to him by Christina's character brings him back to a moment of corporal essence finding himself in the girl's arms. The girl suddenly discovers that they are floating above the floor mid-air. At first startled she soon realizes that the levitation symbolizes the miracle of what had happened, what she made happen to Casper. Their love is sealed with a memorable kiss. Pure. Good. Beautiful. For this performance alone Christina Ricci is immortalized as one of the most accomplished actress's of our times. Like her, the movie Casper the Ghost shall also endure. Art is common. Great Art is rare.",Casper
