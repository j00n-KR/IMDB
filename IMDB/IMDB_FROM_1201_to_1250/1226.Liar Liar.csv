0,TheLittleSongbird,Good spirited and absolutely hilarious film!,9,10 September 2009,"True the plot is a little corny, my only criticism of the movie, but Jim Carrey's wonderfully energetic and most of the time hilarious performance more than compensates. Liar Liar is easily one of Carrey's better films, I do confess I will need to see a few more of his movies before concluding which one's his best to save bias. What Liar Liar manages to do is have a slightly corny though very interesting idea, and make into a good spirited and absolutely hilarious film. The script almost the whole time verged on hysterically funny, and there are many priceless scenes, especially the courtroom scene- I needed to go to the bathroom to check I hadn't wet myself from laughing so much. The other performances were great, Cary Elwes was excellent, and the boy was very sweet and charming. Overall, a hilarious movie, that does cheer you up considerably after a hard day, I still chuckle even thinking of it. There is so much to recommend this, but at the end of the day, it is Carrey's picture. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",Liar Liar
1,Leofwine_draca,It clicked,6,19 September 2021,Not a fan of Jim Carrey at all but I didn't mind this film too much and it's probably my favourite of his work. I just liked the way the 'no lying' storyline played out and the outrageous things he was saying; somehow it just clicked in this one.,Liar Liar
2,SnoopyStyle,Jim Carrey has energy,6,15 September 2013,"Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey) is a fast talking attorney, and he is an amazing perpetual liar. He is divorced from his wife Audrey (Maura Tierney). When he breaks his promise to his son to be at his birthday party, his son uses his birthday wish to make his father stop lying for one full day. Jerry (Cary Elwes) is Audrey's new boyfriend, and he wants to take her to Boston away from Fletcher.Jim Carrey is using all his skills both physical and verbal for this Jim Carrey vehicle. You have appreciate that he put so much energy in this performance. He's not a likable guy until he stops lying. If you can stick it out until then, he might just grow on you.",Liar Liar
3,lee_eisenberg,Carrey forth the hilarious news,8,5 September 2006,"Doing his usual stuff, Jim Carrey plays a dishonest lawyer ignoring his son. When the son wishes for Carrey to speak only the truth for an entire day, Carrey spends the next day making every off-the-wall comment imaginable, and getting his face into weird contortions. It's hard to determine which is the funniest scene, just because of some of the things that he does, but the bathroom beating is really great.All in all, this can be interpreted as a reminder of the importance of family, but it's mostly an excuse to have fun. You just have to try and imagine being in his presence when he says and does these sorts of things. Really funny. Also starring Maura Tierney, Cary Elwes and Jennifer Tilly.",Liar Liar
4,jboothmillard,Liar Liar,9,4 March 2005,"This for me is one of the greatest slapstick comedy films, particularly with the leading star. Basically Fletcher Reede (Golden Globe nominated Jim Carrey) is the successful lawyer who has succeeded mainly with his numerous lies. But he is also the father of to-be 5 year old son, Max (Justin Cooper), and quite often lies to him, and his ex-wife, mother Audrey (Maura Tierney). But this is soon to change when at Max's birthday party, his son blows the candles and wishes ""for one day, Dad couldn't tell a lie"". Fletcher is now struggling with the revolution of only telling the truth, and he has to defend a case with his client Samantha Cole (sexy Jennifer Tilly)! He is now trying to end the havoc, and find a way out of telling the truth or the case. Also starring Saw's Cary Elwes as the annoying Jerry who plans to take Max and Audrey away with him to Boston, Anne Haney as Greta, Amanda Donohoe as Miranda (the first person he tells the truth to), Jason Bernard as Judge Marshall Stevens, Swoosie Kurtz as Dana Appleton, Mitch Ryan as Mr. Allan, Christopher Mayer as Kenneth Falk, Eric Pierpoint as Richard Cole and Scary Movie's Cheri Oteri as Jane. The highlights are the honest name-calling scene, and Carrey beating himself up in the bathroom. Jim Carrey was number 47 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Amanda Donohoe was number 38 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses. Very good!",Liar Liar
5,ccthemovieman-1,"Has Its Moments, But Wears Thin",6,14 May 2006,"This is another of fairly-early Jim Carrey films in which he played a dopey, exaggerated character that is funny but can wear thin on you after awhile. It's almost exhausting to watch this guy for over more than 45 minutes at one time with all the gyrations, rubber faces, screaming and yelling. I am glad he has mostly abandoned roles like this since the turn of the century and done a lot better work.But, the premise of the film is good and there are genuine some laugh-out-loud scenes, mainly early on in the film. If the language and Jim had just been toned down a bit, this would have a really good movie. Once again, this PG-13 rating is a joke. It is not what you want your young teens to watch.",Liar Liar
6,moonspinner55,Above-average Carrey comedy...,6,4 September 2006,"Rubbery actor Jim Carrey, after a brief dramatic respite, returns to slapstick nonsense with this above-average comedic vehicle. He plays a constantly lying lawyer and divorced dad who, via a wish from his slighted son, is forced to tell nothing but the truth for an entire day. Film has a very bright beginning, acceptable middle, but it falls apart at the finish line. Thankfully, the syrupy uplift is kept to a minimum up until that misjudged last act. Good supporting cast includes Jennifer Tilly, Swoosie Kurtz and Cheri Oteri. Carey Elwes, again parlaying his handsomeness into smarmy territory, offers nothing fresh, but Carrey mugs cheerfully throughout and makes the most of these sitcom-like set-ups, which are funny if somewhat shopworn. **1/2 from ****",Liar Liar
7,paul_haakonsen,One of the better Carrey movies...,6,9 January 2016,"This movie does have the trademark Jim Carrey comedy, but thankfully the rubber facial contortions were held to a minimum, which actually serve the movie quite well.Story-wise then ""Liar Liar"" is one of the better of Jim Carrey movies, because there is a deeper story to be told here, unlike many other of his movies which was essentially just physical comedy. The story in ""Liar Liar"" is about Fletcher Reede, a successful, fast-talking lawyer who spends more time at work than with his five year old son who is desperate for his father's attention. With one disappointment after the other, the son makes a desperate birthday wish; that his father will be unable to lie for 24 hours.The comedy was good, and the physical mimicry that is usually Associated with Jim Carrey was held to a minimum. And the cast ensemble was doing good jobs with their given roles, even though Jim Carrey cast a massive shadow over everyone else.I think that ""Liar Liar"" was a milestone and a turning point from the usual Jim Carrey routine and mass-produced physical comedy movies he is known for. Predictable, yes, but the movie is fun and entertaining nonetheless.""Liar Liar"" is a definite must watch if you enjoy a good comedy, or if you just enjoy Jim Carrey movies.",Liar Liar
8,dbdumonteil,truth hurts...,3,17 December 2004,"Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey), is a lawyer who is estranged from his wife Audrey (Maura Tierney). His occupations maintain him far from his home and particularly from his son Max. But he really loves him. One day, for his birthday, Max wishes that his father can't lie for 24 hours. His wish will come true since for 24 hours, Reede will be through a living hell. One must suffer to improve oneself...With ""Liar Liar"", the authors set themselves the following target: to conceive a tailor-made movie for Jim Carrey. Why? Because they surely realized that their topic was thin and it would pose problems to write a screenplay holding water. So, to compensate for the very reduced potential of the script they decided to give Carrey a free hand and to leave a very important part of the film in his hands. Thus, the actor, once revealed with ""the Mask"" (1994) gets out again, without trying to bring anything new to his acting his comical elements that secured his success. It means: his grimaces, his showy expressions and his implausible cues for a kind of one man-show which often borders on the unacceptable. Carrey does his best to bring an ounce of credibility to his character but his bombastic (the term is weak) performance only succeeds in massacring the film. Worse, his third-rate acting is so significant that it leaves little place to the other actors' acting. Actors who try with difficulty to play opposite Carrey.This poor comedy shows once again that exclusively relying on a main actor to save a film can be a serious mistake. Fortunately, it seems that Carrey after this flick wanted to give the image of a conscientious actor capable to direct his career. Indeed, we will see him holding more serious roles where he will be able to restrain his tendency to third-rate acting. Try ""the Truman Show"" (1998), ""Man on the Moon"" (1999) or more recently ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (2004). Let's hope he goes on and perseveres in this way.",Liar Liar
9,blanche-2,For Jim Carrey fans,6,31 March 2009,"Jim Carrey is a super-talented comedian with a handsome, elastic face that by rights should be sagging around his knees, given the way he uses it, and he has more energy than any 20 people put together.I'm a big admirer of him as a talent and as a human being.That being said, the 1997 ""Liar, Liar"" is Jim Carrey all the way. He plays a busy, divorced lawyer who has the best of intentions regarding his five-year-old son Max but often winds up disappointing him. He also often takes the easy way out of situations by lying, usually the little white ones. On his son's birthday, he fails to appear at the party because he's having sex with an attorney (Amanda Donohue) who can help him become partner; he lies, obviously, about why he's not there. His son wishes that his father could just not lie for one day. He gets his wish.The premise is very funny, because I think most of us are not aware of the little platitudes we use so that we don't insult someone, hurt their feelings, or ruin our careers by stating what we really think of someone in power. In the situation of the Carrey character, he has to go into court to defend an adulterous wife (Jennifer Tilly) with a prenup that cuts her out if she ever cheated and claim she never committed adultery. Given his son's wish, he's finding the circumstances impossible.The story is nothing new, but Carrey's take on it is unique to him as he throws himself on the floor, writhes, sputters, makes noises with his throat, screws up his face - all as he's trying not to lie.The thing about Carrey is, you have to be in the mood for his specialized, way over the top humor. If you aren't, you need to skip this movie.A lot of fun for Carrey fans.",Liar Liar

11,michaelRokeefe,A birthday wish comes true.,6,25 June 2009,"Good for some chuckles and not as stupid as most Jim Carrey vehicles. Fletcher Reede(Carrey)is a confident, successful lawyer, who has one major fault. His relationship with his son Max(Justin Cooper)is not so successful. He breaks most of the promises he makes to Max...so in his son's eyes the cheerful attorney is nothing but a liar, liar with a capital ""L"". When Fletcher promises to be at Max's 5th birthday party and ends up a no-show...Max blows out the candles and wishes that his father wouldn't be able to tell a lie for 24 hours. The wish comes true and Fletcher finds his next day at work pretty difficult and extremely embarrassing.

12,sunwarrior13,Carrey Shines As The Truth Impaired Lawyer,10,29 September 2012,"Liar Liar is a family comedy wherein Jim Carrey stars as a fast-talking attorney and habitual liar who, forced by his son's birthday wish, must tell the truth for the next 24 hours. Maura Tierney,Jennifer Tilly,Swoosie Kurtz,Amanda Donohoe,Jason Bernard,Mitchell Ryan,Anne Haney,Justin Cooper and Cary Elwes co-stars.It was written by Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur and directed by Tom Shadyac.Fletcher Reede is a lawyer obsessed with his career, and he's devoted his life to bending the truth to his advantage. This habit has broken up his marriage to Audrey and isn't doing much good for his relationship with his young son Max.He repeatedly promised Max that he'll be there for Max's eighth birthday party.But when an important assignment comes up at work,he calls Audrey and makes an excuse so flimsy that even Max can see through it. When it comes time to blow out the candles on his cake, Max makes a wish that his Dad could go just one day without telling a lie. Suddenly, Max finds himself physically incapable of saying anything that isn't true which, given the divorce settlement case he's just been handed, is going to make his next day in court very interesting indeed.The movie revels in the broad physical comedy that made Carrey a star.Aside from that,it is also designed to show off his warmer and more likable side of his personality especially with his role as a father.And most of all,he is extremely funny as the truth-impaired Fletcher Reede.With regards to the plot,the film is surprisingly touching despite of being a mainstream comedy to generate laughs from the viewer.Overall,it is one of the better comedies ever made.",Liar Liar

14,hitchcockthelegend,If Carrey is your man? This is a laugh festival.,7,6 February 2010,"Flethcher Reade {Jim Carrey} is a sharp tongued attorney for whom lying has become second nature. When his son Max finally gets fed up of Fletcher breaking his promises to him, he makes a birthday wish that his dad can't lie for 24 hours. This creates monumental problems for Fletcher at work, especially as he has a big case in court today.A delightful premise is executed with boundless energy by Carrey, who clearly revels in the chance to show his flair for berserker visual comedy. Some may say over acting, others will say comic genius, either way there is no getting away from the fact that Carrey's brand of high energy, rubber faced comedy is marketable box office product. There has been an annoying trend in some of his movies where his antics have just engulfed the film, leaving no room for anything, or anyone else, to breathe. That's not the case here tho. The family arc is well treated, and well acted by Justin Cooper & Maura Tierney as Fletcher's son & ex-wife respectively. While the lawyer/court room based story provides plenty of scope that is utilised to get its messages over. It's all silly nonsense of course, but even as the film drifts into treacle pudding territory, the laughs continue to outweigh the moments of froth. Be sure to stay for the outtakes during the closing credits; joyous. 7/10",Liar Liar
15,Theo Robertson,It Had The Potential To Be A Good Movie ...,4,13 July 2004,"... Until someone decided it was going to star Jim CarreyI can imagine the studio execs got together for a script meeting "" okay lawyers are total spivs aren't they ? "" Everyone nods in agreement "" They'd sell their mothers for a flat fee "" More nodding in agreement "" Hell someone of them keep child molesters out of the jail if the offender pays a big enough lawyers fee "" . By now the studio execs are in danger inflicting brain damage on themselves as their heads bob up and down , "" And if there's one thing that supersedes a lawyer's greed it's his dishonesty "" , it's a minor miracle how the execs heads are still attached to their necks as they violently nod their heads . "" So let's make a comedy about a lawyer called Fletcher Reede who no matter what will always tell the truth ""Then someone had to spoil everything by saying "" Let's cast Jim Carrey as the star "" Did I mention in any previous reviews that I can't stand Jim Carrey ? I also have no idea why he's so popular because with the exception of ME MYSELF AND IRENE and a couple of other movies he's been in I find Carrey unwatchable . On paper LIAR LIAR might have been a clever comedy but on film it's totally spoiled by Carrey's OTT and even by then far too predictable splac stick spiel . Scream in laughter as Fletcher Reede pulls a funny face , screech with howling laughter as Fletcher Reede attacks himself with a pen , gasp for breath due to fits of laughter with the Fletcher Reede toilet scene .

16,Hey_Sweden,My favourite Jim Carrey comedy.,8,28 December 2013,"True enough that ""Liar Liar"" isn't exactly original - see also the 1941 Bob Hope vehicle ""Nothing But the Truth"" - and that it's ultimately formulaic Hollywood stuff, but when Carrey is on fire, this movie is just riotous. He indulges in some memorable rubber-face and body contorting gags, all in the name of laughs. The script, by Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur, allows him some great opportunities to improvise and bring the house down.He plays Fletcher Reede, a hotshot attorney with a tendency to lie a LOT. And he's good at it, too. Unfortunately, this leads to him upsetting his young son Max (adorable Justin Cooper) one too many times, and the neglected boy makes a birthday wish that his dad will be unable to lie for 24 hours. Naturally, the wish comes true, and Fletcher suffers one major episode after another as he struggles to get through an important divorce case without resorting to falsehoods.Most everybody else here plays the straight man (or woman, as the case may be) to the energetic star. They help to ground the story in *some* level of reality, although by the big action climax, things go completely over the top. One good touch in the movie is to not portray the new man in the ex-wife's life as a villain, i.e. someone she obviously shouldn't be with. There may be a little too much sentiment here for some folks' tastes, but there's still plenty of shtick and good lines to enjoy, such as Fletcher beating himself up in a public restroom, his various bouts of truth telling, and his ""roasting"" of his fellow employees. Carrey is ably supported by such fine actors and actresses as Maura Tierney, Jennifer Tilly, Swoosie Kurtz, Amanda Donohoe, Cary Elwes, Jason Bernard, Mitch Ryan, Anne Haney, and a briefly seen Cheri Oteri.Very funny overall, with the closing credits outtakes adding to the ""feel good"" vibes.Dedicated to the late Bernard, who died on the last day of filming.Eight out of 10.",Liar Liar
17,zardoz-13,"""Liar, Liar"" doesn't capture any of the ""Ace Ventura"" lunacy",7,11 June 2008,"Although Jim Carrey's pants never catch on fire in director Tom Shadyac's ""Liar, Liar,"" this modestly funny comedy should shield him from the bad connection that he made last summer with his offbeat change of character comedy ""The Cable Guy."" ""Liar, Liar"" reteams the elastic faced comic with his inventive ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" director Tom Shadyac, who pulled Eddie Murphy's dying career out of the doldrums with ""The Nutty Professor."" Unhappily, neither Shadyac nor Carrey can chuckle up the barrels of laughter needed to tickle their wishy-washy script. ""Liar, Liar"" casts Carrey as divorced, upscale, philandering lawyer, Fletcher Reede, who lives to lie and lies to live. His lies have already sabotaged his marriage, and his ambitions to become a partner in an illustrious law firm now threaten to scuttle his daddy ship.Hollywood has given us another adorable mop-headed child actor, Justin Cooper. When Fletcher skips out on his son's birthday party, Max wishes that his pop could stop lying for a day. As Fletcher is about to defend a conniving slut, Samantha Cole (Jennifer Tilly of ""Bound"") in a multi-million dollar alimony suit that could win him his partnership, he finds himself compelled to tell nothing but the truth! The premise of ""Liar, Liar"" is as cute and predictable as any episode of the Elizabeth Montgomery TV sitcom ""Bewitched."" Plug Carrey into any predicament that prompts him to prevaricate, and you'll laugh yourself silly at his shenanigans. If you've the ""Liar, Liar"" trailer, you've seen some of the movie's funnier moments. But there's still just enough added hilarity to justify ticket sales. The scene in the board room where Carrey spreads the awful truth about his boss, Mr. Allen (Mitchell Ryan of ""Magnum Force""), and his co-workers is outrageously funny. The outtakes at the end of the movie are as funny as anything from an old Burt Reynolds comedy, too.Sadly, the guffaws don't go far enough in ""Liar, Liar."" Although Carrey dominates the film with is trademark facial contortions, the producers have seen fit to shackle his insanity within a morality tale of suburban schmaltz. When Carrey fight to fib, his face erupts into a kaleidoscope of cheek-tweaking, lip-curling, jaw-jutting expressions matched only by the kind of bodily gyrations that would make him the envy of St. Vitus. The trouble starts when ""Heartbreakers"" scenarists Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur confine Carrey's clowning so that they can develop their sentimental, happily-ever-after storyline. As one movie critic observed, this kind of movie would have been perfect for Michael Keaton, but for Jim Carrey, it is a misfire.""Liar, Liar's"" unwholesome plot elements distract you from the humor. First, they have made Carrey a divorced dad. Second, they have him sleeping with his boss mistress in a ""Disclosure"" style subplot. Third, they have him trying to break up his ex-wife, Audrey Reede (sexy Maura Tierney of ""Semi-Pro"") and her hopelessly bland boyfriend Jerry (Cary Elwes of ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights""). Jerry wants to wed Audrey and wing her off to Boston where he has a job as a hospital administrator. When Fletchers learns that he may lose his son, he experiences a radical conversion that makes you want to cry instead of giggle. Hollywood prefers to whitewash its heroes, but Fletcher seems beyond redemption by the time that he realizes the error of his ways. That's the problem with this contrived comedy; it's far too washy and not wishy enough.""Liar, Liar"" helmer Tom Shadyac seems to have forgotten the light touch. He spends more time deploying his actor for the big jokes instead of letting you enjoy the Carrey-on type of humor that made Carrey a box office sensation. The moments when Carrey gets to mug are wonderful, but when he becomes a puppet of the plot, ""Liar, Liar"" folds.Although ""Liar, Liar"" doesn't capture any of the ""Ace Ventura"" lunacy, Jim Carrey's fans should find it a welcome relief after his role as ""The Cable Guy.""",Liar Liar
18,Calicodreamin,I'm kicking my ass!,7,2 March 2021,"One of the great Jim Carrey movies, Liar Liar is the perfect mix of goofy comedy and heartfelt moments. The storyline is unique and well developed. The characters are well cast and surprisingly well acted.",Liar Liar
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Carrey at his best,7,30 July 2004,"I have to admit, I'm probably a little biased with this movie, as it contains two of the things I love the most in any movie; court scenes and Jim Carrey. I'll try my best to be objective in this review, though. The plot is good, and as the film barely takes 90 minutes it's fairly fast-paced(well, for a Jim Carrey comedy, anyway); I don't think there ever passes 5 minutes without one single joke. The acting is fairly good; Jim Carrey is in his element, so it's no surprise that he's good, but I did find both Maura Tierney and Cary Elwes pretty good too. I know that Elwes is English, not American, and after seeing another movie in which he has a strong English accent(Robin Hood: Men in Tights), I was impressed at how well he does American parts as well. The characters are well-written and credible. The humor is great, partly because it's, well, Carrey, but also because unlike some of Carrey's previous roles, this is fairly ""clean"", so teenagers and some kids will be able to enjoy it as well. The theme of the film is great; I mean, we all know that we lie several times a day(heck, it's even been scientifically proved), but what about if we, for one whole day, couldn't tell one single lie? Great theme, provokes some thought and is executed fairly well in the film, though I do think it could have been done a tad better. Overall, I don't have any major complaints with the film though; I guess it could be argued that most of what Carrey does in this film, the comedy and all, is stuff he's done before, but that's OK; it's not any less entertaining here, regardless of the fact that we've seen it(or something similar to it) earlier. The dialog is great, with some very memorable and quotable lines. All in all, a typical Carrey film, which can be a good thing as well as bad; Carrey does exactly what you expect him to, and he's very entertaining and all, but it never transcends the standard level of the typical Carrey comedy. On a final note, I think this(as well as his other work) proves that Tom Shadyac is the best there is at bringing out Carrey's talents(he also directed Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Bruce Almighty). I recommend it to any fan of Jim Carrey and/or Tom Shadyac. 7/10",Liar Liar
20,neil-476,Good vehicle for Carrey gurning,8,14 March 2020,"Fletcher Reede is an ambitious and unscrupulous lawyer. His success, based on a willingness to say what is necessary, irrespective of whether not it's true, has worked its way into his private life. It has destroyed his marriage - his ex-wife is on the brink of starting a new life with someone else - and it is about to destroy his relationship with his young son. Having been let down once too many times, the lad makes a wish for his Dad to have to tell the truth for 24 hours. This proves hugely problematic in court, where Fletcher is representing a deeply unscrupulous young woman in a divorce case.Jim Carrey's career started with bit parts, then he abruptly hit it big with a series of movies which involved much face pulling and physical comedy. Liar Liar is towards the end of that phase. The story is good, and Carrey's physical shenanigans while trying, and failing, to lie, are often very funny. The supporting casr are excellent, particularly Maura Tierney as the frustrated and disillusioned wife, Cary Elwes as the rather wet but fundamentally decent new boyfriend, and Jennifer Tilley as Reede's odious client.Then we found out, in The Trueman Show and The Majestic, that Carrey could actually act.",Liar Liar
21,Uriah43,A Dishonest Lawyer Grappling with the Truth,6,24 April 2020,"""Fletcher Reede"" (Jim Carrey) is an extremely good defense attorney due in large part to a conscious decision on his part to say anything to get his client off the hook. Unfortunately, this lack of honesty on his part has bled over into his family life with the result that his wife ""Audrey Reede"" (Maura Tierney) not only doesn't trust him but has divorced him as well. He does, however, have some visitation rights to see his son ""Max Reede"" (Justin Cooper) but being the self-absorbed person that he is often wastes these opportunities due to work commitments. Naturally, to absolve himself he then lies to his wife and son rather than telling them the truth. However, that all comes to a screeching halt when his young son blows out the candles on his birthday cake and wishes that for just 24 hours his father has to tell the truth. And having built his entire career on lying that becomes a nightmare for him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an extremely uneven comedy which had some really funny scenes but also featured some serious over-acting on the part of Jim Carrey. Still, the good points managed to outweigh the bad and for that reason I have rated this film accordingly. Slightly above average.",Liar Liar
22,anaconda-40658,This Film Making Any Sense is a Lie.,5,25 May 2015,"Liar, Liar (1997): Dir: Tom Shadyac / Cast: Jim Carrey, Jennifer Tilly, Maura Tierney, Cary Elwes, Justin Cooper: A one joke comedy made completely out of cardboard. Title indicates an accusation made against the title character but the screenplays fails to be anything more than a sitcom. Jim Carrey plays a lawyer who is unable to lie after his son makes a particular birthday wish. He had promised to spend more time with his son but he often fails in keeping these promises. He misses his son's birthday after engaging in an affair. The whole idea of his inability to lie is never explained. It makes no sense that he cannot even write a lie. His next case is constructed totally out of lies. Jennifer Tilly is trying to gain custody of her child even due to a long list of affairs. Directed by Tom Shadyac who previously directed Carrey in the even worse Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Carrey holds his own using much physical humour and a clever manner to his disposal in dealing with the court case. Tilly is in excellent form as Carrey literally makes her believe her own horseshit. Supporting roles are the usual flat cookie cutters such as Maura Tierney as his ex, and Cary Elwes as her potential new boyfriend. Justin Cooper plays his son who seems to have the amazing ability to create magic with birthday wishes. Good idea with a lot of physical humour but without payoff and that is no lie.

23,FlashCallahan,I've had better......,6,5 June 2016,"Fletcher Reede is a fast talking attorney and habitual liar. When his son Max blows out the candles on his fifth birthday cake, he has only one wish, 'that his dad would stop lying for 24 hours'. When Max's wish miraculously comes true, Fletcher discovers that his usual smooth talking, has suddenly become his biggest liability. Legal and emotional havoc takes its toll as soon as the candles are blown out as Fletcher tries to keep his practice afloat and his ex-wife Audrey from taking their son and moving to Boston......Between the release of Ace Ventura and The Truman Show, it seemed that nothing could stop Jim Carrey at the box office........maybe Ben Stiller directing him, but The Cable Guy was a highly original piece of work. Maybe a little left-field for the masses,but it's still one of his best popcorn movies.But what made Carrey so huge was simply his mugging and his animated performance in each film. He basically played the same character with different names and haircuts in each film.You will find a lot of Ace, The Riddler, and Stanley Ipkiss in this performance. In fact Bruce Almighty could have been called Fletcher Almighty and have been a direct sequel to this, and no one would have fluttered an eyelid.The film is perfunctory, and has an almighty sweet streak running right down its sugar coated sign, but we all know why we saw this film, for his hilarious lying, his facial contortions, and the part where everyone becomes so happy, that life could never be more perfect.But nearly twenty years later, it's easy to see why Carrey's star has faded. He was a one trick pony at comedy, played the same character every time, and yes, The Truman Show was good, but it isn't as amazing as what critics made it out to be.It just stood out because he did something from the norm.So all in all it's still funny, but the parts where Carrey isn't mugging or lying, it's pretty bland stuff.",Liar Liar
24,Aaron1375,"Funny, but it did get overly sentimental at times too.",7,11 December 2010,"This film came after the poorly received Jim Carrey film ""Cable Guy"". While I do say this one was better than that one, it was not really all that much better. It was funny watching an attorney that could not lie and the bizarre things he had to do at times to try and get around it and win the case, but it was also a bore watching him with his son and realizing how bad a father he was. It was also just embarrassing to watch him do that claw thing. The film is about a man who has not been the best father in the world and has a habit of breaking his promises. So his son decides to make a wish on his birthday that his father not be capable of lying and strangely it comes true. Funny scenes abound like his awkward elevator encounter, his courtroom antics and a very funny scene where he beats the crap out of himself. The film is just about all Jim Carrey as the only other character that made an impact is Jennifer Tilly as a very nasty woman who is suing for custody of her children and trying to get all the money she can from her husband. Still, Jim Carrey is pretty much on fire for most of the film and he had enough energy to carry this film at this time. I realize you had to have a reason for him to be incapable of lying, I just did not really care for the son and the family parts of the movie. Just a matter of personal taste.",Liar Liar
25,SimonJack,A good comedy borrowed from an earlier smash comedy,7,12 September 2020,"This is a pretty good comedy with Jim Carry as Fletcher Reede, a fast-talking attorney who has to tell the truth for one full day. He promised his son, Max (Justin Cooper) that he would not tell a lie for 24 hours. Fletcher has some encounters during the day that are very funny. Some others seem forced or contrived for the plot and don't register much on the humor scale.""Liar Liar"" is an idea borrowed from an early 20th century book that was made into a very good 1941 movie. Bob Hope stars in it, along with Paulette Goddard and a host of top supporting actors of the day. But, where that film, ""Nothing But the Truth"" has some very funny dialog and crazy antics based on sophisticated comedy, this film has a single track for comedy.The 1941 film plot was based on a character who always believed in telling the truth. And he had three protagonists who were out to trip him up. All of that generated much mayhem at times, along with tremendous comedy. In this film, Carrey's character is faced with a reverse of his usual character. His rapid-fire style as an attorney was constantly peppered with untruths, and he lied often in his personal life with his family.So, he is challenged to keep his promise by himself, and has some funny scenarios as a result. This happens in discussions with cohorts, staff and clients. It is entertaining and a fun film. But, it can't match the comedy of the 1941 film that has a cast of characters divided between Hope's business buddies trying to trip him up on the one hand, and a larger group of people who are shocked by what he often says to avoid telling even a fibAfter watching this film, modern audiences should get many more laughs watching ""Nothing But the Truth"" of 1941.",Liar Liar
26,Mr-Fusion,Carrey in fine form,8,20 November 2017,"There's a virtuous message at the heart of ""Liar Liar"" (a yuppie lawyer learns the cost of putting career before child) that helps the movie achieve timelessness; and that's part of the reason this is still so watchable after twenty years. It's even one of those ""cable movies"" that tends to draw you in whenever it's on. But seriously, can you think of anyone other than Jim Carrey who could've carried this movie? Even back in mid-'90s Hollywood. Absolutely not, and most of the laughs come from just pulling the ripcord and watching him go. It's his anarchic style and manic energy that gives the dialogue its potency. The supporting cast is left to do the heavy lifting while Carrey owns the screen. And it's for the best. This is over-the-top in the best sense, and it remains highly watchable today.8/10",Liar Liar

29,Smells_Like_Cheese,Jim Carrey's best film!,10,15 November 2003,"Liar Liar is in my top 3 favorite comedies of all time and my favorite Jim Carrey flick! He was just so awesome and hilarious in Liar Liar! Not only did he do mental comedy, but physical comedy that will make your stomach hurt from laughing so much! I'm not kidding when I say that I know a dozen people where we just rehearse the lines from Liar Liar back and forth, because all the scenes are just so memorable.Fletcher Reed is a lawyer who, surprise, lies to win cases. He's a huge success and is about to be made partner by his firm if he wins one last case for Mrs. Cole, a divorcée who cheated on her husband with tons of proof against her, Fletcher has to prove that she was a victim of circumstance. Fletcher has a son and an ex wife as well, he lies to them all the time as well and makes excuses why he can't spend enough time with his son, Max. When he lies and cancels going to Max's birthday party to sleep with his boss to get ahead, Max is terribly disappointed and hurt, so he makes one birthday wish, that his father cannot lie... guess what? It works! Fletcher wakes up and tells his boss she was not the best he had, leading to an encounter with a hottie in the elevator and making offensive comments about her ""jugs"". He passes a homeless man and tells him why he doesn't give change to ""the decay of western society!"" and goes to court not very ready to fight his case that could make or break his career since he can't lie. More comedy ensues as Fletcher deals with the pressure on how to learn to tell the truth to win the case and prevent his son and ex wife from moving to Boston with her new boyfriend.Liar Liar will make your sides hurt and you'll watch this movie again and again when you see how hilarious Jim Carrey is. My sister isn't a Jim Carrey fan and even admitted that she had more than a few good laughs watching this film. Not to mention that it has a great feel good ending that you'll just fall for.10/10",Liar Liar
30,MovieAddict2016,One of Carrey's finest -- it doesn't try to be anything it isn't. Would I lie?,6,16 December 2003,"""My dad is a liar,"" a small child says. ""You mean a lawyer,"" his teacher responds. He shrugs his shoulders. They're both the same, aren't they?Jim Carrey is a liar in ""Liar Liar"" (1997), which successfully uses Jim Carrey -- the king of annoyance -- to its full advantage.Jim Carrey has, given time, grown on me. I didn't like him at first. Then I learned to put up with him. Now I find him perfect for some film roles such as Lloyd Christmas in ""Dumb and Dumber"" (1994).I never think that Jim Carrey is ideal for a role, really, until I see him in it, and then I think that no one could have done it quite so well. But I still don't particularly think he's a very good comedian, per se.Here he plays Fletcher Reede, a high-grade attorney so caught up in his work that he has little time to devote to his young son, Max (Justin Cooper), the type of plot-created kid that these type of films deserve. Max is mad that his dad keeps missing out on all his activities, so his birthday wish is every lawyer's worst nightmare: no lying. Max wishes (or commands) that his father can no longer tell any lies, and the wish is granted by the powers that be. This is a problem for Fletcher, indeed, since he has just acquired the case of an adultress housewife (Jennifer Tilly) who wants to keep her kids. She spills the truth to Fletcher -- that she has had many affairs -- and this is not the type of thing a man uncapable of lying is able to cope with.Fletcher spills his guts at the court proceedings, tarnishing his image as a professional lawyer. In one of the film's better scenes, he walks into a court bathroom and beats himself up, slamming his head in a toilet and punching himself so that he can postpone the trial to a later date.Why is the sight of a man violently clapping his head against and between a toilet seat funny? Because it's Jim Carrey who, as I mentioned above, may not be the funniest man alive, but by the box office numbers may technically be -- and he does have a knack for physical, spastic comedy (too bad it can overtake his roles sometimes). Here he unleashes it when it is needed, and it works, because it is not a pointless exercise in energetic behavior, but quite the contrary.The situations one can get into with the restrictions of only telling the truth are limitless. These types of formulas always work good in Carrey's movies -- those involving abnormal abilities. There's a reason they keep making similar films following the same formula.As my (small number of) readers probably know, I am not a commercial critic with my grading scale. I am quite conservative, only giving high ratings to films that really deserve them. I hesitate to give ""Liar Liar"" anything more than the rating I have given it, although I must say that it is a very fine comedy with some great gut-busting laughs, and that any fan of inventive comedy -- Carrey fans or not -- should see this movie.After all, would I lie?4/5 stars.John Ulmer",Liar Liar
31,DKosty123,The Truth is not in Order,6,23 February 2013,This movie is very much and example of a Jim Carrey film where Carrey runs rough shod over the script and puts on a one man comedy show. The results of this is very funny. The thing is it is one of many films that establishes Carey as a sort of Jerry Lewis for this generation. His manic comedy is very much like Lewis was in his prime.Carrey has a lot of energy here as a Lawyer who has to tell the truth for 24 hours due to his sons wish. There is some Lewis type schmaltz in his sympathy for the kiddies. In a way Carrey came along at the right time because his manic humor can include adult themes more in the 1990's where Jerry Lewis was more limited by censors what he could do.This gives Carrey's Comedy more bite than Lewis could have in his movies. For example he can tell a woman she has big... where Lewis would just be able to mug a va va voom in his movies. Carrey is very funny when he does his stuff. That is the main reason to,Liar Liar
32,sddavis63,A Pretty Funny Movie,7,13 December 2009,"Not all comedies manage to get a laugh out of me. This one did - several times - so I have to rate it as a success. I'm not a huge fan of Jim Carrey, and what I don't like about him was evident in abundance here. It was actually summed up by castmate Swoosie Kurtz in the last of the closing out-takes when, while filming one of their courtroom scenes, she turns to him (in a scene where she makes an objection) and shouts ""Over-Actor!"" Yeah. That sums it up, and Carrey responds with the words ""They're on to me!"" Give him credit - at least he can poke fun at himself! Having said that, his over-acting is distracting and detracts from both the movie and the credibility of his character. Questioning the honesty and ethics of lawyers may be everyone's favourite sport, but Carrey's portrayal of lawyer Fletcher Reede was just too over the top to be believable.And yet, this still works - it's a pretty funny movie. Fletcher builds his law career and his life on lying - to everyone (hence, the play on words: liar/lawyer) including his ex wife (which is probably why she's his ""ex"" wife) and his young son, whom he regularly hurts by promising to visit and then making excuses to get out of it. His lies make him a success in the courtroom though and he's on the verge of making partner at his firm when his son makes a wish while blowing out his birthday candles - that for one day, dad wouldn't be able to lie. The wish comes true and the result is chaos. I suppose there's three basic points being made: first, if we all told the truth about everything it would cause a lot of trouble (think of Fletcher speaking to the woman he's never met on the elevator and telling her how much he likes her rather significant ""endowment"") and a lot of hurt even to the people we truly care about; second, if we were to lie about everything it would also cause a lot of trouble ; and, finally, don't ignore your kids - they're precious and they need our attention.It's a funny movie with a message. If you can deal with Carrey's over- acting, it's worth watching. 7/10",Liar Liar
33,thesar-2,The sequel should involve a Politician Pappy...,9,8 August 2010,"I could fill two pages of quotes from Liar, Liar and only skim the surface on how incredibly funny it was. Yet, I wouldn't be doing the movie justice because it's not all about comedy, but heart, drama and growing.A lot of movies try hard, they really do try their best to blend comedy and human drama and come up with the same conclusion when water meets oil. Director Shadyac picked the perfect crew, writer and actors to make us truly believe the heartbreak these characters go through.Immediately labeled as a ""liar"" or lawyer, as teacher corrects student Max Reede (Cooper,) attorney (and Max's father) Fletcher Reede (Carrey) is close to the top of his firm and inching closer. Unfortunately for him, he's sacrificing the love he truly has for his son, whom he shares joint custody with his ex, Audrey (Tierney.) He doesn't just sacrifice, he's abolishing all hopes and dreams of the little one, even when Max, nor, oddly his mother, give up on him. In the main premise scene of the movie, Max make a birthday wish that for one day, Fletcher cannot tell a lie, strangely enough, the day starts at 8:15 PM.Unfortunately, Fletcher has the biggest and Make-Partner case of his life defending Samantha Cole (Poker Goddess Jennifer Tilly with unusually short and blonde hair) when everyone knows she's slimy/guilty/slutty and the only way to get her ""just rewards"" in her own divorce case is for Fletcher to lie.He needs a work around, when it's finally clear to him (THE PEN IS BLUE!) he cannot even fib. Serious comedy ensues when he juggles his anti-deception (apparently in any form), his son who might be leaving 3,000 miles with mom and new fiancé, the case, his boss & boss's boss and actually taking to heart what this really means.A la Groundhog Day. Which, by the way, ranks slightly over this movie, but both are under the same fantasy realm in which a character must embark on unusual circumstances to, well, learn a lesson.I hate to downgrade the movie to ""Okay, fine, you have to like Jim Carrey to like this."" I understand the world's divided with Carrey lovers/haters, Adam Sandler haters/lovers, etc, but I have spoken to multiple people that don't care for Carrey and still love this movie.I'm thinking it has to do with the excellent acting all around, the deep humor and characters and also the heart that went into the story.If you've seen the recent Toy Story 3, and you see that little girl in the finale sad she couldn't get the toywell, that's a cartoon (and well done, I might add.) I truly felt Max's heart shatter when his father lies to him or lets him down. At the same time, I honestly felt he never gave up, even though it was absolutely knocking him down. Simultaneously, I felt Fletcher grow and show true love for his son. You don't get these two characters in half the Dramas that come out.And this is labeled as a comedy. It's freaking hilarious from moment one to Carrey actually making fun of his own career, concerning funny faces, to the outrageous finale that if you feel like you don't believe that could happen – remind yourself: the movie's based on a birthday wish that actually comes true.Make sure you watch the deleted scenes, including the outtakes in the closing credits. Too bad this received a PG-13aside from a few minor words and sexual situations, this really is good for the whole family. SEE IT!",Liar Liar

35,ElMaruecan82,"Jim Carrey as the man who ""can't handle the lie"" ...",8,17 January 2013,"Ever since societies existed, lies could either be the drivers or killers of human relationships, but I guess we have to blame it on truth. The trick with the truth is that sometimes we want to tell it but not to hear it, or vice versa. Do we really want to know what is said about us at the third person? Truth is a social double-edged sword, and lying a psychic boomerang, hitting you in the face when you don't expect it.This is why the main premise of a film like ""Liar, Liar"" where a man endures the curse of not lying, worse: not being able to articulate one lousy syllabic that wouldn't tell the truth is not only hilarious, but intellectually challenging, as it incites us to question the place 'lying', occupies in our lives and daily agendas... and occasionally on America's judiciary system. Indeed, maybe the fact that the story focuses on a slick lawyer in Los Angeles, a sort of Lionel Hutz in flesh and blood and competence, asks a bit too much on the suspension of disbelief department, still what a premise, the kind that probably started with a simple ""what if"" question and one wondered how no one ever got this idea before. It seems so clever, yet so simple, but it's not a laugh-riot guarantee either, my guess is that it's the kind of plot premises that can only work if you have the comical performance to efficiently conduct it from paper to screens. Think about that, ""a man can't lie"", so what, what is funny? The fact that he can't lie can easily become redundant; it's all in the diversity of reactions then. And who's better than Jim Carrey to takes you by surprises even when you expect to laugh? Only Carrey could have been so hilariously, pathetically, frantically funny in his desperate attempts to let one single lie comes out of his mouth, especially the day of a very tough divorce and child custody trial.Jim Carrey delivers his funniest performance, and certainly one of the funniest of the 90's, Adam Sandler? Chris Farley? ""Liar, Liar"" is the ultimate proof that Carrey is the real thing when it comes to comedy. Carrey's face is a gift from Cinematic Gods, hell, you don't even need CGI, it's like every parcel of his face is capable of displaying more hilarious elasticity than all the comics of his generation combined in all of their films. ""Liar, Liar"" is 80 minutes of demonstration, of Carrey's talent and comical superiority. Naturally, it's not just all about grimaces, funny faces or scream, like the best comedies, ""Liar, Liar"" has a heart and maintains an overwhelming everyday feeling, we're enjoying Carrey's talent, but still, we think of our own lives or lies.Marking the return of Jim Carrey after the film 'that almost ruined his career' according to Homer Simpson, ""Liar, Liar"" is the second collaboration with Tom Shadyak after ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" in 1994, the breakthrough year where he starred in 3 movies from the Box- office Top 10. He made it again with ""Liar, Liar"", for all the zaniness, Jim Carrey played a more mature, and identifiable character through Fletcher Reed, half liar, half lawyer (a clever opening joke probably lost in translation in all the foreign versions). While it does flirt a little bit with the too-busy-to-see-his-son father cliché, it avoids it by focusing on lying, this is Fletcher's problem, he can't see his child because he just built his whole life, professional, social and familial, on lying.And when the kid gets one lie too much, he blows the candle of his birthday cake and makes the wish that his father can't lie during 24 hours, the curse applies immediately with the hilarious sex aftermath comment followed by the unforgettable drool-inducing elevator scene. Indeed, this scene speaks for all the men who tried to maintain eye-control in front of a nice pair of juicy  well, that's our mind whispering to us, and Fletcher's nightmare is that it's his mind controlling his words. And while transposing his case to my personal life, I wondered to what extent my life would have been different if I had one day without lying. I even shudder thinking to the eventuality of my wife asking me some questions about my past. Of course, it's just a film, but still.So, as soon as the curse operates, the movie takes off for a magnificent, flamboyant bravura performance from Jim Carrey, one gag after another, making the little archetypes, from the cute Justin Cooper with the worst haircut ever to Maura Tierney, the comprehensive divorced wife who still has feelings toward her ex-husband and the dull and boring replacer, Cary Elwes doing well in a rather ungrateful role, not to mention the scene-stealing Jennifer Tilly as the slutty ambitious unfaithful wife, they all become insignificant, because it's Carrey's film. And Carrey carries it with the power of his face, and a terrific script, one that visits every kind of situation where the 'to lie or not to lie' dilemma plays a pivotal role, even one that allows Fletcher to relieve himself by roasting everyone during an unforgettable board meeting, literally the film's laugh-out-loudest moment. And we catch our breath during some genuine moments of true father- and-son tenderness showcasing an unknown capability for seriousness, something the previous movies didn't show. And ""Liar, Liar"" probably played a vital and pivotal role in Carrey's career, proving he was at ease with slapstick humor (damn, I can't get the face he had with the luggage thing stuck in his face) and emotions too, a versatility that would be confirmed in ""The Truman Show"" one year later. And ""Liar, Liar"" concludes with a nice moral, if you build your life on lies, it might collapse sooner or later, if did for Fletcher, but the essential remained, and he would finally value it.",Liar Liar

Now, with the Fletcher telling the truth, there is going to be turmoil in the life of Fletcher. The acting is good for the most part. I thought that Jim Carrey was annoying doing his comedy antics. Some of his scenes were hilarious though especially when he his beating himself up. The other actors such as Maura Tierney and Jennifer Tilly did a good job. I liked the music in this film.

40,sol-,Truth hurts,6,18 January 2016,"Unable to lie as a result of a birthday wish, a lawyer who has built his career on fibs discovers how hard it is to tell the truth all the time in this Jim Carrey comedy vehicle. The premise is fairly decent with the overarching question of whether it is possible to live without lying a little. One of the film's best scenes has Carrey insulting all the partners and senior members of his law firm simply by telling the truth as he sees it, which they mistake for practical joking (why else would anyone be so insolent?). Most of the film though does not capitalise on this agenda as Carrey constantly chews the scenery, making absurd noises and weird faces as he struggles to lie. In fact, the film's funniest bit comes in the end credits blooper reel as Swoosie Kurtz calls him an ""overactor"" - though there is also a fun part in which he tells his son that not only will his face not freeze if the wind changes, but in fact some people (Carrey) make living out of making funny faces! The film does not stack up particular well to repeat viewings though since much of the plot hinges on Carrey doing the unexpected, and beyond Carrey's facial antics, the father/son angle is just schmaltzy. There is also something uncomfortable in how the film wants us to cheer for Carrey getting an adulterous client off the hook and cheer for Carrey himself, who only ever seems like an obnoxious human being. The film does have several genuinely hilarious moments though in between Carrey's mugging though and it does highlight how much society is built on white lies, but 'Liar Liar' is really a Carrey showcase all the way.",Liar Liar
41,filipemanuelneto,Jim Carrey at his best.,6,22 November 2016,"Fletcher Reede is a competent lawyer who has learned that lying is easier and more rewarding than telling the truth. This will change when his son decides to ask as a birthday wish that Dad spend at least a full day without being able to lie. A day that will change Reede's life. Or at least that was the intention of Jim Carrey in this deeply beautiful and touching film, where the laughter mingles with the beauty of the love shown by a father who truly wants to regain his family. The script, by telling a morally edifying story in an effective way, can therefore be considered as one of the strongest points of this film.Jim Carrey has achieved here one of his most important successes. With it, he became a consecrated comedian. His performance is truly colossal, there isn't a moment where he doesn't shine, completely overshadowing the rest of the cast, with the honorable exception of Justin Cooper, who gives life to the sweet and innocent son of the lawyer. Some of the scenes involving Reede and Max are worthy of humorous anthologies.Personally, I consider this film as the consecration of Jim Carrey, rather than the most famous and popular ""Bruce Allmighty"", who came a little after. The story is very simple but beautiful, the cast work was very competent, the direction of Tom Shadyac worked well... basically everything was up to the project. It's not an exceptional film, it's not a timeless work of art. It's a film for familiar entertainment, to see and to laugh. If viewed in this light, it's an excellent film.",Liar Liar
42,funkyfry,Fun for Carrey fans,6,5 October 2007,"This is a Jim Carrey vehicle and it's hard to see it amounting to much more than that. But taken in that context it's an entertaining movie, certainly more fun to me than most of his attempts at drama. In this one Carrey plays a man who, as a result of a birthday wish from his lonely son whose party he's missed, finds himself unable to lie for one day. That sounds simple of course but there are many comic complications stemming from the fact that his character is a lawyer with rather low ethical standards who must present an important argument in court. The meat of the story concerns his relationship with the young son, after his absentee behavior is thrown into relief by the mother's plan to move to Boston and marry a straight-laced man (Cary Elwes).It's worth noting that the film is well enough written to avoid some of the genre clichés in such a way as to actually make the film more interesting. For example in a lot of these types of ""divorce dramedy"" movies the new fiancé would be depicted in a really ridiculous way, a total obnoxious jerk or loser. In this film he's more of a nobody than a loser, and they carefully avoided making Elwes' character a jerk because in actuality it's Carrey's who is the jerk, at least at first. The fact that the guy is not a bad dude makes it even more hilarious when, for example, he and the son go off to play ball with the glove Carrey bought for the kid. Carrey's got no good reason to hate him or be mad, but he is anyway. And we totally understand! Some of the courtroom scenes are laugh out loud funny, and I also really enjoyed the scene where Carrey's character presents the case he's been preparing and turns on both his boss and his client (Jennifer Tilly). The child actor, Justin Cooper, was refreshingly free of the kind of manufactured ""spunk"" that seems to infest most child performances in comedies. Basically the movie should be commended for avoiding some of the stale aspects of the family film, but at the same time I didn't feel that it really transcended the genre either nor did it provide any really memorable characters that would have enhanced the human element of the story. It's an excuse for Carrey to once again make us laugh with his rubber face, and he does do that well.",Liar Liar
43,Anonymous_Maxine,"Jim Carrey is back in yet another great comedy, although it doesn't quite live up to the spectacular Dumb & Dumber.",8,3 September 2000,"Liar Liar is about a boy who, after being stood up by his big-shot lawyer father one too many times, wishes that for just one day his dad couldn't lie. This wreaks havoc on his personal life and even more on his professional life as a lawyer who makes a living putting criminals back on the streets. Carrey is immediately and constantly hilarious in his role as the unwillfully honest Fletcher Reede. Every scene is full of awkwardly straightforward behavior and dialogue (""Whatever takes the focus off your head!) that is funny because it is so unusual and unexpected. Maura Tierney delivers one of the best performances of her career (second only to her wonderful job in Primal Fear), but Cary Elwes plays a disappointing turn from his amazing job in The Princess Bride. Seeing him as the endlessly charming Wesley in that film and then seeing him as a squirrely step-father type in Liar Liar just didn't seem to fit, but the film was able to overcome such small problems and present itself as a good and entertaining comedy.
In addition to the good comedy that Liar Liar presented, there were strange comedic scenes that Carrey had never done before. For example, I have never seen him portray a descent into madness as was shown with the blue pen, and it should be noted how well this funny man played the part of a man trying very hard not to be funny, with hilarious results. This is a bit like his role in Man on the Moon where he was a comedian playing a comedian who was often deliberately not funny, and the results there were hilarious as well. Jim Carrey's great comedy acting skills were a crucial element of this film, but they are not the only redeeming value of the movie itself. The story is solid and legitimate as well, and it is well-presented and directed, resulting in a good, fun comedy.",Liar Liar

However on his son's 8th birthday party,Fletcher starts to tell the truth which causes hilarious consequences. From the hilarious pen scene to the part where he punches himself in the bathroom,this film is hysterically funny. I've always been a huge Jim Carrey fan since I was a kid and this film just shows how over the top he is. It's also a very short film as its on for 87 minutes.If you haven't seen this film do watch it.

IMHO, this is his best performance yet.There is not one millimeter of wasted film to this work.

Sometimes it all goes too far and becomes what I call ""actor gags"" where the humor is all in the performer with nothing funny in the joke at all.But I can't not be fascinated by the particular physicality of this man's interpretation of the role. Sort of like a snake devouring a pig it morbidly demands the attention.There's a fine plot here and all but thankfully the experience is just a joke book of stuff they could come up with surrounding the central idea. It is pretty cool to explore how this curse works. I did find it a little strange that he was not able to ask a question that he knew would lead to a lie but could still lie by omission, but hey, who said that the wish granting gods were perfect?The more human side of the movie with the non-Carrey characters is a lot less charming but they never dwell on it and in the meantime I never got bored enjoying one goofy gag after another.And overall I did sort of like the sentimental father-son aspect too.",Liar Liar

A pretty cute premise that just got overwhelmed by Carrey's brand of physical comedy.

I was really touched when Fletcher told Max (Justin Cooper) that he was hurting emotionally, played with him, and hugged him. The part I really like is when Fletcher and Dana (Swoosie Kurtz) call each other names. It was funny during the movie as well as during the credits. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that Max was brave to make that wish.

50,gcd70,Likable Carrey,5,29 August 2008,"For someone who does not normally enjoy the bizarre antics of in-your-face comedian Jim Carrey, I rather liked this amiable light fare about habitual liar Fletcher Reade, a man whose career is set way above fatherhood on his priority list.Carrey performs some amazing physical slapstick, and he makes the ridiculous look humorous quite often. His persona, however, is still difficult to adjust to.When in comic mode, ""Liar Liar"" works well, and the support play off the leading man admirably. Especially likable is Fletcher's feisty secretary, played by the wonderful Anne Haney.The film does err in focusing on drama at times, and this is when the movie's soft under-belly is exposed. Still, it's the best Carrey film I have seen to date.Sunday, April 19, 1998 - Video",Liar Liar
51,Enchorde,Very funny one man show,8,11 February 2005,"** Here be spoilers, and that's the truth **Recap: Fletcher Reede (Carrey) is a successful lawyer about to become partner at the law firm where he works. In his work he frequently lies and he cannot stop out of work either. He constantly lies to his former wife Audrey (Tierney) and son Max (Cooper). This leads to him constantly disappointing and hurting his son, and now Audrey plans to move with her new boyfriend Jerry (Elwes) out of town. But Max very much loves his father and at his birthday party, which Fletcher of course is absent from, he wishes that for one the day, his father cannot lie. His wish comes true. And this proves to be a tremendous problem for Fletcher. His new case is utterly depending on him being able to lie and manipulate, but he cannot do it. His entire world falls around him.Comment: Even if there are many other good actors around, this basically is a one-man show. Carrey's show. His character's inability to lie puts him in bizarre situations where Carrey can use his entire range of vocal and gesture comic ability. And he does it well, very well. His co-actors find themselves in his shadow, even if their performances still are good. But they're not given as much space and time as Fletcher is, and by all means, in this movie this is as it should be. Carrey even outshines the story, though it is a mistake to overlook it completely. The story is the foundation for Carrey's character ability to act and helps with some nice witty and funny lines. And there are a fleck of seriousness in the development of the relationship between Fletcher and Max. However, the best parts might actually be after the movie ends. During the credits some outtakes are shown, and they're hilarious. Be patient, sit tight and enjoy them. All in all, a great comedy well worth to watch more than once.8/10",Liar Liar
52,Samiam3,"Ironic, amusing, and kind of touching. Among Carrey's best",7,31 October 2009,"There are two facts which Liar Liar stresses clearly. One is optimistic and the other is rather pessimistic. In truth, most of us probably tell far more lies than we tell truths to people because it keeps us from getting slapped in the face among other things. It also points out that the most that in a capitalist society, where the family unit is never as communally linked as in other parts of the world, the most important thing to a boy (once he passes the age of Oedipus complex) is being with his father. With this in mind, Liar Liar is one of Jim Carrey's more emotionally intelligent comedies. Carrey is Flecher Reede, a sly/sharp criminal lawyer. His success comes from the fact that he is full of lies. He is away from home a lot. On the day of his son's birthday, he makes a couple of promises that he doesn't keep because he gets a good offer that evening. He misses the party. For the kid's birthday wish, he wishes that his father could only tell the truth for a day. It is going to be a very hectic day for Flecher, hopefully he can pull of the latest case he has been assigned to but can he also convince his ex wife not to leave with his son for Boston? She has a new boyfriend who has proposed to her.In the tradition of Charlie Chaplin, and Buster Keaton, Jim Carrey is the best slapstick comedian today (or he was a few years ago). He is never dull here. Although I cannot recall a time when Carrey has made me scream with laughter, this I think is one of his best performances. Unlike with the Mask, this is Carrey doing the work, not the special effect department. I doubt if I need to describe what he is capable of, Most of us know, but for those who don't this might be the best film to introduce Jim Carrey to you. Either this or Ace Ventura...and that's no lie.",Liar Liar
53,triple8,Solid funny entertainment,7,18 February 2005,"Liar Liar is one of those movies that's great when you just want a pure comedy. And what a comedy it is too! Carey turns in a manic and very good Performance as the dishonest attorney, forced to his horror, into telling the truth for an entire day because his son made a birthday wish that happened to come true. Liar Liar takes a concept that's funny to begin with and makes it, at times, actually hilarious , mainly by not taking itself to seriously and just going wildly creative and outrageous with the concept. This is a movie that I would solidly recommend to someone who just wants a light, if rather manic, comedy. I am picky about my comedies and consider this to be actually hilarious in some places, a good example being in the court room when Cary in the middle of questioning a shady client (who is lying), objects to his own questions. LiarLiar is not without flaws, there are some times it gets a bit to slapstick, a bit to obnoxious and the ending, while very sweet was a little over the top with the airport scene. I still liked this a lot though as a whole. It's purpose is to entertain which it does. I really do love this concept. Imagine someone who lies regularly having to tell the straight truth no matter what. I could think of a few people who might have trouble with that(and who it might be really entertaining to see while they do it!). In closing, I really liked this very much and the movie makers and cast, especially Carey, did a great job of having fun with the concept and pushing this as far as they could.

54,Movie-ManDan,A Freaking Hilarious Film With Lots of Heart.,10,14 January 2015,"In 1994, Jim Carrey broke out as Hollywood's favourite funny man in movies with Dumb & Dumber, The Mask and Ace Ventura. 1995 and 1996 saw him starring in the lesser like Ace Ventura sequel and The Cable Guy. 1997's Liar Liar made him show the world that he was still the real deal.This is one of Jim Carrey's best and funniest movies. He is over-the-top funny and also displays good acting. He plays hotshot lawyer, Fletcher Reede, who is the best liar in the business. His fibs help him score huge wins in court, while also distancing himself from his son (Cooper). When he misses his son's birthday party, his son makes a wish that he couldn't lie for one whole day and it actually comes true! He gets in trouble with everybody in the courtroom that day as well as everybody out because he depends so much on lying. Sole honesty makes his chances of winning a prestigious case impossible. He must also find a way to keep his ex-wife (Tierney) from taking their son with her boyfriend (Elwes) to Boston.The character of Fletcher is, like most of Carrey's characters, goofy and comical. When he gets cursed with honesty, he becomes extremely outrageous and Carrey's comedic brilliance really pours out. Every time he confesses to something, the entire truth rolls out as he struggles to keep it in and lie. I believe that sometimes wishes do come true. But not lying is too unrealistic. The movie's theme is not to go back on a promise and stick to the truth whenever possible. It is nice to see such a hilarious movie with such a nice moral.",Liar Liar
55,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A comedy that really makes you laugh with a couple errors,7,26 May 2015,"By the middle to late 1990s, Jim Carrey had solidified his presence in Hollywood history by moving from Saturday Night Live skits to major box office grabs like Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994), The Mask (1994) and Batman Forever (1995). It seemed as if Carrey was destined to always play some kind of supernatural character that had no limits as well as not being able to live on the common social level at the time. That is until he starred in this movie. For this role, it was actually a step down from the weird and crazed out parts Carey had played in the past. It is by no means as toned down as his performance he would later play in The Truman Show (1998) but at this point, it was the beginning of that transition. The story follows Fletcher Reede (Carrey), a lawyer who loves doing what he does by unethically lying to get by; that also means his family. After missing out on his son's birthday, Max (Justin Cooper) wishes that his dad couldn't lie for one whole day, which ends up coming true.The catch is, Fletcher has a huge case coming up which if he wins (by lying) he could earn the big bucks. The script written by Paul Guay, Stephen Mazur and directed by Tom Shadyac (who has worked with Carrey before) prepare and execute the story properly. Specifically the way the characters are written is a big part. The Reede family show that his son and divorced wife Audrey (Maura Tierney) try endlessly to work with Fletcher's schedule of lies but it wears thin quickly. Making things tougher is Jerry (Cary Elwes) a friend who's moving out and wants Audrey and Max to come with him. Another large strain are the characters that take part in the court case, mainly Samantha Cole (Jennifer Tilly) the defendant and Fletcher's boss Miranda (Amanda Donohoe). All of these smaller threads are taken care of and provide the right character development for Carrey's role. The other interesting spin the writers put on this story is how the plot uses morals, ethics and social commentary on the judicial system as a backdrop for the entire message of the film.The only problem to the writing is the wish that Fletcher's son, Max makes. Up and until the wish is made and takes full effect, the audience gets the idea that the world they are in is the real world. However, when the wish is made Fletcher can't control himself. By what means made this come true and what's keeping him from making a lie? Most would consider this very nitpicky and too critical but it is a giant question in the film's story. Who has the power to grant these wishes? Do they apply to other children or people in general? All unanswered questions that probably the writers had no time to think about. The best supporting element to the story however is Jim Carrey's comedy. These are the moments that allow Jim Carrey to be himself and be spontaneous with his responses were which many are sure most lines were unscripted. But it's also not just the lines, the actions Fletcher takes to make sure that he doesn't get himself into trouble is hilarious too. Some of which situations are so extreme it makes the viewer wonder if one would go to such measures too.The other elements that work in this film's favor are the music and cinematography. The director of photography belongs to Russell Boyd who is competent in his work at getting the right shots from the courtroom to the office hallways. However, the best things Boyd does is when Fletcher starts going crazy. This leads to various angles at which the camera portrays other objects in the room as other living things. That's clever because audiences then begin to believe the object being focused on is living. As for music composed by John Debney who didn't have many well-known scores released at the time manages to pull off the comedic and dramatic scenes quite well. The only negative thing that can be said is that it sounds very dated with its familiar like 90s family comedy drama sound. It sounds so 90s. Finally the only other thing that dates the movie more than it should have were the visual style of the haircuts and dressers back then. Haircuts like Jerry's are just really old looking now. Other than that it's good.The dated sounding music and visual appearance of the actors don't let it age well. Plus the reasoning behind how Max's wish came true weren't explored. But for the most part, the writing is spot on with well- developed characters, downright laugh out loud scenes, and the story's subtext commentaries it addresses.",Liar Liar

That's not just another clichéd romance between a bad father and a son without attention from his father, it had a more intelligent plot. And it's interesting that lawyers have a lying fame all around the world, not exclusively in my country.Of course I laughed in some parts when Carrey did his crazy faces spittin' at everyone, but I don't think it was fair to classify this movie as a comedy.OK fellas, now I have to exercise the bitchy side of me. The judge wasn't that believable, obviously he would have stopped the judgment when he noticed Fletcher was kind of sick. Also I don't believe that a dad would trade a son's birthday for sex.

He always promises the boy that he will pay him a visit, but when that moment has come he always has something better to do. Because the boy is so disappointed by his dad, he wishes that the man will be honest for an entire day and surprise, surprise: his wish comes true.What you get is typical Jim Carrey, but it works perfectly if you ask me. It could have been a corny movie that you would love to hate (in other words a typical Disney movie), but he made something original out of it. In some movies he really exaggerates and then I'm not a fan of his work, but this time his style and overacting didn't bother me once. I had a great time watching this movie and was laughing all the time. I just loved the idea of the career driven lawyer who always lies but now has to be honest for an entire day and therefor almost loses his job and career that is so dear to him. I'm sure that many lawyers in real life would have a lot of difficulties as well if they had to be honest for one day.All in all this is one of Jim Carrey's finest comedies.

60,DeeNine-2,Pants on fire,7,20 October 2002,"Jim Carrey puts so much energy and pure comedic brilliance into this movie that we hardly noticed how corny and hackneyed was the plot or how wearily didactic was the moral lesson for all fathers who neglect their children for the goddess of success. And really we didn't care. What we loved almost as much as Carrey's rubber mouth and oral blockage (like an overheated boiler fighting not to explode) was the premise: a lawyer that can't lie. Now there's an oxymoron! As Carrey tries to explain to his son Max, lawyers need to lie. Actually he says grownups need to lie, which is a truth that we really do not need to exam too closely here. To laugh at something deeply troubling in our nature is a way of dealing with it.So the genius of this movie is first the talent of Jim Carrey, but second, for kids who come to the realization of adult mendacity for the first time, it is the discovery of comedy as a way to cope. Why do adults need to lie? is a question that a kid can never figure out, and then by the time he is an adult himself (or actually a teenager), he can no longer comprehend how important the question once was. Call it innocence lost, or the socialization process.My favorite part of the movie is the courtroom scene with Jennifer Tilly dressed oh so sluttily and her adulterous beaux looking like a model for the cover of a romance novel and Carrey in tatters in his $900 suit. Second would be the bathroom scene in which Carrey tries to tear himself apart (and seems to almost succeed). His flapping mouth between the toilet seat and the bowl was inspired. Give some credit to director Tom Shadyac, who managed to steer the vehicle with Carrey at the controls, and to writers, Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur, who wrote some funny lines.The great comedians totally let themselves go. They are totally on. They go to extremes and beyond. It's like transcending not just the ordinary, but even the imagined. See this obviously for Jim Carrey, one of the great comedic talents of our time, an original who would have delighted Charlie Chaplin with his extraordinary muggings, his blatant audacity and his suburb timing.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

61,dunmore_ego,Fabrication Retardation.,7,1 January 2011,"Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey) is a lawyer aka, ergo, ipso facto, a liar.

It comes true.In LIAR LIAR, Carrey is once again directed by Tom Shadyac (who rocketed both their careers with ACE VENTURA PET DETECTIVE) and the result is once again as magical as the inexplicable force that compels Fletcher to tell the truth no matter the consequences.The hook in LIAR LIAR is that Carrey plays a normal guy, not a ""character"" - and the honesty ""curse"" turns him into a ""character."" Because he is just a regular man in the real world, his descent into truth and his resistance to it is all the more explosive. And his normalcy sometimes catches us off guard, highlighting what a brilliant dramatic actor Carrey can be when he isn't careening off the walls, as when he blurts to his wife ""I'm a bad father!"" Maura Tierney is Fletcher's long-suffering wife, who has put up with his dishonesty long enough and plans to move to another town with her new boyfriend (Cary Elwes), taking little Max with her. Though his actions prove him discourteous, disrespectful and untrustworthy, Fletcher's abiding love for Max causes him to identify and make the changes he needs to keep Max nearby. It takes a day of telling the truth for him to realize what a big liar he's been all his life.Jennifer Tilly is the unethical defendant Fletcher must represent without the ability to lie. Amanda Donohoe as the office slut who exploits Fletcher's honesty by asking him what he thinks of the office staff and the boss - in front of them.Each scene is a Carrey masterpiece of ingenuity, of twisted faces and frenetic limbs, of speaking in tongues and grappling with oneself; as with his best work, it is indescribable and inimitable.One of Fletcher's clients calls him after being arrested again, needing advice, to which Fletcher screams into the phone, ""Stop breaking the law, asshole!"" Every time I call my own lawyer, I'm grimacing and waiting for him to say the same thing...During Fletcher's Truth Phase, Max asks him if it's true that if you make weird faces they'll get stuck that way, to which Fletcher assures him, ""No, in fact some people make a good living that way.""

My favorite comedian will always be Jim Carrey. I think that Liar liar is such a funny and heartfelt comedy that it's awesome. It's hilarious. I know it may seem a bit unbelievable at first or throughout but it's real. Jim Carrey did this film and Yes Man, which had a similar sort of premise. I prefer Liar liar, though Yes Man was really funny. Carrey doesn't say no a lot in this film, he lies. Though he is hoping that lies will get him somewhere, it actually comes back to bite him in the ass. It's the same thing with Yes Man. Except in Liar liar he doesn't really have a love interest.

I always have been and love the energy and charisma he brings to his roles, so 'Liar Liar' was always going to be entertaining for me.A film as silly and over-the-top as this would fail with just about any other actor, but these are the films that Carrey always thrives in. He's excellent once again in 'Liar Liar' and I can't fault any part of his performance - he's hilarious from start to finish. Carrey's facial expressions and mannerisms alone are enough to make you smile and he is probably the only reason why such a simple and shallow plot remains interesting for the duration of the film.As a Jim Carrey comedy, it gives you exactly what you expect and you can't really ask for anything more.",Liar Liar

66,blott2319-1,Superb comedy that still makes me laugh out loud,9,29 July 2020,"I have loved Liar Liar for decades. It came out when Jim Carrey was still at the top of his game, and was a massive box office draw. While goofy things like Ace Ventura and The Mask made him popular, I think that this film is the ultimate example of what he can do as an actor. This movie allows him to have those unhinged moments, but gives an explanation for his insanity that makes it feel relatable instead of idiotic. I love the more heartfelt moments that he includes in the movie as well. He never feels like he's faking it when he's with his son and ex-wife, despite the fact that a few scenes earlier he was flopping around on the ground simply because he couldn't say the color of his pen. The film has a charm that makes it feel authentic even though the premise is crazy, and most of the sane characters would try to have him committed if this were the real world.One of the things I appreciate most in Liar Liar is that it is one of the rare films about a workaholic father that actually makes you feel like he is in the wrong. Typically these movies make it seem like the father is bad simply because he's dedicated to his work and doesn't want to sit at home all day playing with his children (as if work and income are instantly evil.) But in Liar Liar we see a father who is genuinely neglectful, who can't keep his promises to his son, and who will completely blow him off for lousy reasons. It makes the transformation by the end more satisfying and is one of the rare times where ""maybe I should quit and start my own firm"" actually feels like a good solution. It also helps to have Cary Elwes in the film as the stark contrast because he is the type of father-figure young Max could use.However, I am able to recognize that Liar Liar isn't a perfect movie. There are many things that go on which would never be accepted in an actual courtroom, or even in an ordinary office. You have to accept that in some ways this is all taking place in a heightened reality separate from our own so that a man can rant and rave without serious repercussions. The tone of the film can also get a little saccharine at times. It's funny, because Cary Elwes' character is mocked for being too square and cheesy, but the movie falls into the same trap at times. Also, Justin Cooper was not a good child actor. There are some important story points handled by this kid, and he is on par with Jake Lloyd in the Phantom Menace. But I am immune to noticing these flaws when I watch Liar Liar, because I'm too busy laughing at it all. This movie never fails to put a big goofy smile on my face.",Liar Liar
67,hall895,Settle down Jim,6,27 June 2010,"In Liar Liar you get pretty much everything you would expect in a Jim Carrey comedy. You've got your physical humor, your screaming and shouting and, of course, you've got lots of mugging for the camera. Carrey never met a camera he couldn't make a funny face into. In some of his movies all of this Carrey being Carrey stuff works perfectly. This movie however leaves you wishing he could have dialed things down a few notches. There are moments here where the typical Carrey zaniness works. But there are more moments where Carrey's outlandishness overwhelms the story. Which is too bad because unlike some of his other movies where the outlandishness was the whole point this movie actually has a story you can really appreciate. The movie is actually rather charming but you get the sense it would have been even more so if only Carrey could have reined himself in a bit. You just wish that Carrey and director Tom Shadyac had trusted their story a little bit more and let the story carry the movie. Instead this becomes just another typical Jim Carrey movie. Not that there's anything necessarily wrong with typical Jim Carrey movies. It's just that this one had the potential to be something a little different and a little better than that.In this movie Carrey plays lawyer Fletcher Reede, a man very focused on his career. And certainly not nearly as focused as he should be on his young son Max. Fletcher is separated from Max's mom and whenever he sees his son it seems all he does is make promises he can't or won't keep. And then comes the fateful day when Max, upset that Fletcher has failed to show up for his birthday party, makes a wish that his dad could not tell a lie for an entire day. And when that wish immediately comes true the consequences for Fletcher are immediate. Having to tell the truth all the time can really get a guy into trouble. Not to mention make it rather difficult to do your job when you're a lawyer whose whole case is one giant fabrication. Hilarity ensues. All that Carrey being Carrey stuff. Some of that stuff is admittedly quite good but some of it does miss the mark. There's a great story in there about Fletcher trying to reconnect with his son but too often that story gets lost amidst all the Carrey shenanigans. Carrey overshadows everyone and everything else in the movie. Which is too bad. Yes, you know Carrey's the star of the movie. And yes, you know Carrey's going to do all the things which made him a star in the first place. But this movie called for a little less wackiness, a more grounded performance. Here Carrey had a good story and a couple of other really good performers, most notably Maura Tierney playing Fletcher's ex-wife, to work with. But he just couldn't help himself. Jim Carrey was going to be Jim Carrey, with all the contortions and overacting and relentless mugging that entails. And in the end, despite all its potential, that makes this just another Jim Carrey movie.",Liar Liar
68,Stampsfightclub,Occasionally important comedy that Carrey once again steals,7,21 January 2009,"Fletcher (Carrey) is having difficulty seeing his son, putting his career first. On his birthday his son Max (Cooper) wishes that Fletcher can't tell a lie for a whole day.Jim Carrey has always been a comic genius. From the wonderfully daft Ace Ventura to the insane Mask, the actor has been pleasing audiences for years. On seeing Yes Man in cinemas recently, I couldn't help but feel he has out grown that wonderful slapstick nature he produced so easily. Many have critics have said that recent flick is this 1997 picture all over again, only with a bungee jump and a Terrance Stamp lecture thrown in, and in all honesty, that really is the case, though this is thankfully funnier.With an inevitable ending and a central character who has to overcome a difficulty for everything to be alright again this is conventional cinema at its most obvious. But, and it's a big but, Carrey has taken his comic ability and thrust that into the central character which will please fans and his Fletcher feels like a somebody, more because he knows he is a bad father.The issue of parenting is brought up frequently, though far from significant as it was in other comedies like Ferris Bueller's Day off. Thanks to the encoding of this important issue, the story itself feels important, but then it is still lost on cinematic stereotyping and conventional story. As good as the comedy is to; the shine falls on that instead of the important issue of parenthood.Justin Cooper is really good as Max, a young lad who wants a strong role model. The supporting cast otherwise offers no surprises with everyone as predictable as next Easter.The narrative with its predictable nature still surprises every so often. There are some sharp moments and Carrey's funny nature maintains likability. His humour is the only reason to carry on watching. The first ten minutes or so are incredibly unfunny by his standard so hang on in there for some great slapstick and insulting comedy.To be fair the narrative offers up a twist towards the end, but this appears as an attempt to preach to an audience already lost in the comic nature of the film. Kudos of including it though as most comedies round off straight away.Liar Liar, though consistently predictable, has a charm and a likability that can't be ignored and though the preaching of parenthood is obscured by the comedy, it still feels important.",Liar Liar

Until he starred in this film, he had been in ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""The Mask"" and ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" to name a few. None of them are quite as funny or entertaining as ""Liar Liar."" It's basically the story of a lawyer who lies quite often, until on his son's birthday, there is a wish made for him to not lie for one day. My, the things that occur! Carrey stars as Fletcher Reede, a defense attorney who wins his cases by having the defendants lie. His life is turned upside down however, after his son's magical wish comes true. He realizes afterward that it is family that matters most, not his work. The film sends a good message to parents about not lying to your children.",Liar Liar
72,krorie,Bubble Paper,6,9 November 2005,"This is a remake of a 1941 Bob Hope film ""Nothing But the Truth,"" done by the producer and director of the remake of ""The Nutty Professor."" Though the scripts are very different from the originals, the general plots and developments are similar. Whether you love ""Liar Liar"" or hate it depends on your feelings toward Jim Carrey, because it's basically a Jim Carrey movie. There are a few comic gems thrown in from time to time, especially by the motor pool guy and by Jason Bernard as the judge. The two funniest routines are the cop pull over and the hilarious scene when Carrey beats himself silly in the men's room of the court house in a vain attempt to get a postponement until he is able to lie once more. A befuddled elderly gent walks in just as Carrey begins to ram his head against the wall. His double takes are as funny as Carrey's self flagellation. When he finally inquires as to what is going on Carrey flippantly replies, ""I'm kicking my ass."" Realizing this must be a mad man, the elderly gent takes off like lightning.Carrey's ability to distort his facial and physical features is uncanny. In this ability he is similar in many ways to the great Jerry Lewis. Lewis' humor, however, was generally, though not always, on a much higher intellectual plain than is Carrey's. Carrey's histrionics are at times outrageously funny when they work and embarrassingly silly when he goes over the top. His humor is very unpredictable. There can be no doubt that he has a knack for far out comedy. Of all the Jim Carrey movies I have seen, ""Liar Liar"" pleased me the most. I found myself laughing aloud from time to time. The elevator bit with the woman with big boobs is excruciatingly funny. On the other hand, the final comic episode of the movie when Carey jacks equipment so he can catch the plane taking off on the runway is so far fetched that even his wild antics cannot salvage the scene.If you're a Carrey fan, you'll die laughing. If you're not a Carrey fan, you may still find this outing funny.",Liar Liar

Hey, it's just a movie!! Of course, I do know a little eleven-year old who knows literally every single word to this film! It's not even funny. I've seen this movie many times over and I recently watched it with him. He spoke every damn line of the film out...it was annoying!!!Anyway...if you liked this film, I recommend you see some of Carrey's other films that came after this one. ME, MYSELF & IRENE and THE GRINCH are probably good choices. BRUCE ALMIGHTY is another movie that seems like it would be a good recommendation. Either way, LIAR LIAR is one of Carrey's better works.

There are few movies as humorous as this one, being ""Mousehunt"" one of those few - another 1997 motion picture.Every minute of ""Liar Liar"" is pure fun and every minute means a good laughter. Many moments are hysterical! Jim Carrey is often a great comedian, but this is him at his funniest side.The story is very funny and entertaining: Fletcher Reede, a lawyer with the habit of lying and breaking promises, suddenly sees himself forced to become honest during the next 24 hours after his son's birthday wish comes true. He doesn't understand what's happening to him and that is driving him insane... he can't tell any lies, not even write a little lie! Whenever he tries to and whenever he talks, it's a huge mess for sure! He even transforms the court room into a circus, seems to lose his mind and makes goofy faces! Incredibly hilarious!The actors have great performances. Jim Carrey is great as Fletcher Reede, but there are other equally good actors, like Maura Tierney as Audrey Reede, Cary Elwes as Jerry and little Justin Cooper as Max (Fletcher's son). Max is also referred to as ""Maximillian"" and ""Monster Max"" by his father, who loves to do ""The Claw"" much for his son's delight. I know Cary Elwes from ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" and I do know that he is an English actor, but he speaks with a good American accent in this film. Some might think that Jim Carrey overacts here and that his humor is too crummy, but the energy he shows here is not something anybody could do. It requires a very energetic and patient comedian and Jim Carrey proves his talent to do so. The kid is cute. He almost looks like Sean Marshall in ""Pete's Dragon"", with that face and long hair.At my point of view, ""Liar Liar"" has funny humor, not irritating or dirty humor. It is a modern light-hearted comedy. Its aim is purely fun at the highest level. I think it's difficult not laughing while watching this movie. Lots of very funny lines are another attribute.Directed by Tom Shadyac, ""Liar Liar"" is the best thing Jim Carrey and Tom Shadyac ever did together and slightly superior than the later ""Bruce Almighty"".",Liar Liar

Carrey has proved himself time and again many times and should be taken more seriously as an actor. i can't honestly say i liked 'Dumber' or 'Ace', but movies like 'Eternal Sunshine', 'Truman', 'Man in the Moon' and 'Series of Unfotunate Events', are certainly Oscar worthy. he most definitely should have been nominated for 'Liar'. i checked the other nominees that year and his performance was better than more than a few of them. is it because Carrey is a comedian who specializes in over the top humor and slapstick? just because a man is loved by little children doesn't mean you shouldn't take him seriously.'Liar Liar' is a charming film and should be revisited by those who don't take it seriously. it has a message with heart and is a minor classic among recent films.",Liar Liar

He has the amazing ability of being able to project his feelings and emotions to his audience,Most of the other characters watch with open mouth his rapid succession of antics.

The concept might have worked, but the problem was that Jim Carrey spoiled everything by his extreme facial mugging. We compared him to Jerry Lewis, whom he was trying to imitate, but even Lewis never twisted his face around so much like Carrey kept doing in this movie. After a half hour, we got sick of it and unloaded the video.It's a high-concept idea, and perhaps could have worked if some other actor had done the job. If instead of twisting his face around to an extreme when he couldn't give a false answer to a question in a courtroom, the lawyer might have used a more subtle way of showing he couldn't talk, the movie might have had some laughs.

His attempts at dramatic work aren't half bad, either. His prime of comedies came in the late 90's, with such movies like Liar Liar. In it, the script's written for him and he doesn't need to do any acting, just make faces at the camera. That has got to be the world's easiest job.Carrey plays Fletcher Reede, a lawyer who is known for winning a case in any way possible. However, he rarely has time for his wife and son, so they break up. And any time that he is supposed to do something with his son, Fletcher never makes it and makes an excuse. So for his son's birthday, he wishes that his father would never tell a lie for one whole day. And lo and behold, it comes true. On the day of Fletcher's most important case, he can't tell a single lie, which causes distress in his job and more.For the most part, Liar Liar is a good comedy. It's entertaining, it's humorous, and a plot that goes someplace. Although some of the subplots don't really go anyplace, or don't really work, like his wife's new relationship, it did open up another trademark Carrey ""funny thing"", like The Mask did with ""Smokin'!"" and Ace Ventura did with ""All righty then!"", and that is the whole thing about The Claw, which is pretty funny. Tom Shadyac seems to know how to direct Carrey and not to really have the camera off of him, which works well, since his constant mugging to the camera and his zany antics are basically what make up the movie.On the downside of everything, though, there's one thing that takes away from the movie. That's the lack of laughter that was going through me.

I only watched this movie because it was starring Jim Carrey, who happens to be one of my favourite actors, and I'm glad I did because his movies doesn't really disappoint, and Liar Liar was no exception. In fact, you could argue that this one was one of his best comedy movies available. Jim Carrey literally stole the show or limelight. When you see it, it feels like he was the only one that made this movie to be such a success, and it's hard to argue against that.

The other actors' performances could just have easily been reading from cue-cards through the whole thing and it wouldn't have made much of a difference.The reason I give it a 7 is simply because of Carrey's outrageous performance when he is under his son's spell and from who else could you see a man brushing his tongue and still find it kind of funny.

Jim Carrey gives the best comic performance of his career here as Fletcher Reede, a fast-talking lawyer who's always lying. His son Max doesn't like this one bit. Fletcher promises Max that he'll be at his 5th birthday party. But Fletcher calls and tells his ex-wife Audrey that he can't make it because at the moment he's being seduced by a female partner. Max has had enough. His birthday wish: for one day his father can't tell a lie. And it miraculously comes true! And this is where the movie gets explosively funny. This is the beginning of a long and crazy day for Fletcher. He gets in trouble left and right. Everyone around him thinks he's going crazy. And the habitual liar continuously makes a complete fool of himself. Carrey is the whole show here in what has got to be the craziest, nuttiest, silliest, goofiest, and downright best comic performance of his career. And he's got a terrific cast of actors to support him. Maura Tierney and Justin Cooper shine in the main supporting roles as Audrey and Max, respectably. Swoosie Kurtz, Jennifer Tilly, Amanda Donohoe, Anne Haney, Cary Elwes, Mitchell Ryan, and the late Jason Bernard also generate laughs amongst the craziness. ""Liar, Liar"" is one extremely funny comedy directed by Tom Shadyac who directed another crazy comedy, the aptly titled remake ""The Nutty Professor"".

95,bbewnylorac,Decent comic movie,7,14 July 2014,"I think this is one of Jim Carrey's best movies. He clearly is ecstatic at being given free rein to express his physical, Jerry Lewis style comedy in every single scene. But he is capable of expressing the deeper emotional dilemmas underneath the character's manic facade -- the fear of losing his son, and the sudden panic that for some mysterious reason he can't lie. His whole life up until now has been a lie, so the movie becomes a fish out of water tale. It's like he has to deal with becoming a whole new person, and it is funny. As his world weary ex-wife, Maura Tierney is excellent. I like how the producers chose her -- someone capable of giving an individual, quirky performance -- and not some vacuous dumb bimbo. The character of Carrey's son is one of those factory line six year old boys -- bowl hair cut, cute little face, spilling out cute little lines. Which is no reflection on the little actor, it's just an annoying Hollywood 'type' that I wish they'd change. And the boy does have good comic timing. Jennifer Tilly, as Carrey's buxom, adulterous client, and Swoosie Kurtz, as the rival courtroom lawyer, are among an ensemble giving excellent acting support. To me, the best character is Carrey's secretary, played by the late Anne Haney. Haney came to acting very late, in her 40s, and when she played this role must have been in her 60s or 70s, yet she is a riot playing a strictly 'straight man' role, ridiculing Carrey's outrageous antics and utterings as he tries to lie, but can't. She plays that upright New England, morally correct personal assistant type to a T, and it's a pleasure to watch, and very funny. I think it's the quality and depth of the supporting roles that are often the most telling aspects of a film and so it is here. Even the judge, again playing it straight, shines as he takes many of Carrey's blatherings seriously, making them more funny.",Liar Liar
96,DavidSim240183,Could have been more.,3,13 January 2010,"Jim Carrey has made a career out of rubber faced antics and slapstick gymnastics since becoming a star with Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. The Cable Guy was an admirable attempt on Carrey's part to try something different that didn't quite come off because it was just the same old shtick in a whole new movie. The Truman Show was a more successful attempt to flex Carrey's wings as an actor.After a frosty reception greeted The Cable Guy, Jim Carrey returned to what he knew best in Liar Liar, a film with an interesting premise - a man who lies for a living can only tell the truth. Played with a wider scope of imagination, Liar Liar could have been something akin to Groundhog Day - a single premise put through a rigorous, intensive experiment that scaled greater and greater heights. Or a cruelly hysterical black comedy if made by the Coen Brothers. But in Tom Shadyac's hands, instead it just becomes a one-gag vehicle for Jim Carrey's manic mugging.I've never been a fan of Tom Shadyac. His films either collapse into silliness like Ace Ventura, or sink into soft-headed sludge like Patch Adams and Bruce Almighty. The one exception on his resume is the delightful remake of The Nutty Professor. The one film he's ever made where he pulled everything together into a successful package. A film as funny as it is sweet.But Liar Liar sees Shadyac return to his usual weaknesses. The problem I have with the film is it never really knows what to do with its idea. Even at a slim 85 minutes, Liar Liar's one and only joke is stretched. And that's to see Jim Carrey acting like a one-man loony bin. Not for the first (or last) time.Jim Carrey's given some pretty whacked out performances in his day. But the one he gives in Liar Liar almost makes them seem minimalist. After his son makes a birthday wish that his father can only be truthful for a whole day, it springboards Carrey sky high. There are some who no doubt derive amusement from watching him go completely off his head. But I just found all of the shouting and the yelling and the wailing so wearying.Carrey throws himself into the role with total reckless abandon. In fact, that's what he does a lot of the time - throwing himself around. Some scenes in the film are just awful and they go on at embarrassing length. Like when he's holding a blue Biro, tries to say its red and he can't no matter how much he wants to. But even worse then that is the scene in a men's room when he trashes the place to get out of the courtroom. It all makes you wonder what lunatic asylum Jim Carrey escaped from.The main problem with Liar Liar is that Jim Carrey isn't the right actor for the role. Since the theme of the film is a dishonest, inattentive father seeing the error of his ways, then what it needed was someone who can play greedy and sarcastic, and then equally downplay it to meet his redemption. Someone like Bill Murray.But because this is Jim Carrey, all we get instead is him yelling the house down from start to finish. That's all he ever seems to do. Whether it be the slick lawyer lying through his teeth, the attorney forced to tell the truth, or the changed husband and father who wants to fix things with his son. There's no sense of a man changing into a better one. Just an obnoxious man that knows no limits how far over the top he can go. Its an annoying, one-note performance.Because Tom Shadyac refuses to rein in Carrey's excesses, Liar Liar just gets more tedious as it goes on. Even before we're halfway through, the film has become like gristle between your teeth that you can't dislodge no matter what. And the film arrives at a ridiculous ending. Something that involves Carrey using a stair escalator at an airport to stop his ex-wife and son leaving on a plane. The fact that they get back together is stupidly contrived. And it seemingly casts aside her relationship with a good man in an irritably cavalier manner.Liar Liar may have been a sizable box-office success, but I just found it irritating to the max in every way. The comedy. The way Tom Shadyac tries to tack on a false moral at the end. But even worse is watching a potentially good idea wasted on such a lame vehicle. A missed opportunity that really could have been so much more.",Liar Liar
97,SkullScreamerReturns,I can't lie - this movie is pretty funny!,6,10 June 2020,"I'm not the biggest fan of Jim Carrey, I think his style started to become a bit repetitive at some point. But I must admit he manages to be quite funny here, and the concept of the film - a sly lawyer who suddenly loses his ability to lie - is hilarious from the start. A lot of crazy things happen and I found myself laughing out loud many times... often in absurd moments like him dumping a garbage can on himself in the toilet. Asking myself why am I laughing to this, it's not even funny...but it just is!
Recommended for anyone who likes Carrey's over the top goofing around (with a good plot too).",Liar Liar
98,lagudafuad,just there,6,23 December 2012,"Jim Carrey does have a gift for slapstick comedy, making you laugh all the way to the bank, this is the second of the three movies that Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey made together and to me it is also my second favorite after Bruce Almighty but before Ace Ventura.The thing for me is that Liar Lair, didn't strike as a very funny movie, after a while the slapstick humor become more annoying than it was entertaining. The storyline which has a sticking resemblance to a Twilight series episode which will be easy to catch by twilight fans, had the tale of not being able to lie for just 24 hours, while the Twilight series episode was about the protagonist not being able to lie as long as he owned a car or something.The movie plot is about a chronic liar and divorcée who has wrecked his home with his insensitivity, and his carelessness. With only one thing that is true in his life Fletcher (Jim Carrey) was still finding it hard to meet up to expectations as his constant lying was costing him his relationship with his son Max (Justin Cooper). After Fletcher blew off his son's birthday party to have sex with his co-worker (lying that he had to work) Max decided to make a wish that his father will not be able to lie for a whole 24 hours.Now Fletcher is a lawyer, who has a multi-million dollar case that he is on at the moment, a case all built on lies and he is finding it difficult to keep at it, since he can't lie nor ask a question knowing full well that the answer is a lie.Well Liar Liar found a way to make a man who is insensitive and not caring find a way to have a happy ending, and all he did to learn his lesson was winning a case with some honest deductions, and chasing his son on a hijacked mobile stairway in an airport which landed him on a stretcher.Like all other Tom and Carrey movies it was a box office hit, recouping its production cost and more. This is not my favorite Carrey movie and as I have said not my favorite of his duo with Tom Shadyac but Liar Liar has its moments. So if you are jumping on the wagon of a Carrey DVD collection; you may want to consider this one, but mind you to me it is just there.www.lagsreviews.com",Liar Liar

101,theshadow908,Jim Carrey's funniest film.,8,14 June 2006,"Liar Liar tells the story of Fletcher Reede, a hotshot lawyer, father, and ex-husband with commitment issues. Every single time he promises something, he doesn't do it. After upsetting his 5 year old son, his son wishes that for just one day his father couldn't tell a lie. The wish comes true, and hilarity ensues as Fletcher struggles to lie himself out of situations when nothing but the truth can leave his lips. Liar Liar is a comedy with a message, and with Jim Carrey's hilarious style, the movie is a guaranteed fun time.Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey apparently work really well together, because all of their pairings have been hilarious. This is a god comedy for Carrey because he's not playing a zany character like a pet detective, a dumb limo driver, or a superhero on steroids. No, instead he plays a normal every day guy. An intelligent lawyer who just doesn't make time for his son. Only when he can't spit out a simple lie, such as saying a blue pen is red, does the movie get truly hilarious. He suddenly finds everything he cares about crashing down around him because he can't lie, and Carrey's hilarious facial expressions and actions just amplify the already funny situation. The fact that the movie makes several jabs at the lawyer profession and that the movie actually has a message behind it makes it a better comedy than most.I am a huge Jim Carrey fan. Have been ever since I first saw him in Ace Ventura. His movies of late haven't been all that satisfying, but I can always turn to Liar Liar to make me laugh. Most comedies are funny for the first two times you watch it, but afterward they become dry. As for Liar Liar, it keeps me laughing every time. Overall, it's a really good comedy that I think most people will enjoy.8/10",Liar Liar

103,mOVIemAN56,Carrey is pure genius,8,16 April 2006,"Jim Carrey proved yet again with Liar Liar that his comedy and acting abilities are outstanding. Carrey plays the witty Fletcher, a divorced lawyer who is in the middle of the biggest case of his life. Along with trying to prepare for the court hearings, he has to find time to spend with his cute and loving son Max who he constantly is breaking promises too, never intentionally. On the night of Max's birthday, in which Fletcher promises to attend but gets 'caught up' at work, max wishes that his dad could for one day, not tell a lie. What follows is the funniest day of his life. Being unable to tell a lie, Fletcher now must find a way to win the case and his son and ex-wife to his side. The court hearings are pure genius with Carrey as the lawyer acting opposite Jason Brenard as the judge. The two make a comical duo unlike any other with Carrey providing the wit and Brenard the sternness needed in the judge. The reason the film works so well is the acting. The plot is nothing to rave about, man not able to lie trying to win over his ex-wife and win a court hearing, but the actors in their roles are superb. Carrey carries 90% of the comedy and is fantastic. The final court hearing will have you in pain you're laughing so hard. Jason Brenard gave a great performance and it's a shame him and Carrey did not get to work again before his death. Jennifer Tilly easily convinces anyone that sees her that she is a total b*tch and not deserving of any money in the case. Maura Tierney wouldn't have been my first choice for the role of Fletcher's ex-wife but she held her own in probably the only serious role of the film. Cary Elwes even has a short role as Audrey's (Tierney) new love interest who may be taking both her and Max to Boston and out of Fletcher's life forever.The interaction between characters is outstanding. The scene where Fletcher makes fun of his boss and all of his executives for five minutes straight was pure genius. Carrey carried most of the film but no one should look past the other actors, they bring some great laughs also.Liar Liar, even though it isn't the most thought out comedy, it sure is one of the funniest. Carrey was pure genius with all the one liners and just plain actions he performs during the movie. He's constantly moving and jumping and yelling. The film gives a clear message of how people are much happier when they don't lie and it's done in Carrey fashion.4/5 Stars",Liar Liar

His son then makes a wish that his father won't lie for a day, and unfortunately for the dad, who's trying to win a case in court for a client who's clearly guilty. As you can see, it's a very funny setup and the movie delivers constant laughs, thanks to Carrey's 110% efforts in the physical comedy department. Throughout most of the movie, Carrey's character doesn't want to have to tell the truth so the a highly visible battle between the side of him that doesn't want to tell the truth and the spell cast on the other side of him which, provides Carrey with the perfect arena he's been looking for to showcase his high-energy antics since his sophomoric days of Ace Ventura and Dumb and Dumber.

His son, Max, hates this, so he wishes on his 5th birthday(since his Dad is too busy having sex) that his Dad will go one day without lying.This works, and his father gets himself in outrageous trouble for it.I was sheltered as a kid but I was allowed to see a few PG-13 movies. At first my Mom allowed me to see this-but then she realized how dirty it was. There's a ton of sexual references that neither of us approved of.

I do not understand how they can speak ill of ""Liar Liar"" if it's excellent, not only makes of a liar father but makes of a liar and crazy father who works like lawyer, I die of laughter the funny things that does Jim Carrey in this movie but it's a bit exaggerated like when he hits with the toilet lid in the bathroom and a gentleman who does not understand it looks at him.The ending phrase ""Nothing stops the claw!""

After half a hour I had had more than enough, but I love Maura so stuck it out until the end. Sure there's a few laughs here and there but not nearly enough to compensate for Carrey's stomach turning idiotic performance. First, no judge would tolerate the ridiculous antics of this buffoon. And the judge's final decision is unfathomable absurd. Trust me, you will want to smash your television to oblivion after watching Jim make this face and that face and contort his body into all these weird positions. Not funny. Not dramatic. Not clever. His attack of conscience at the end was just the final nail in this commercial for Jim's ""talents."" Complete with a predictable sappy ending.

Whether you were a person who saw it in 1997 or if you're seeing it for the first time in 2010, this movie includes a whopper list of gut-wrenching jokes along with Jim's best performance.Fletcher (Jim Carrey) is a lawyer who's career currently hinges on a case that requires him to lie, but when his son Max gets upset for the last time (after Fletcher misses Max's birthday), Max puts a curse on his dad where he can't lie for 24 hours.On a wild adventure of watching Fletcher try to lie when he clearly can't, we're forced into watching the overacting of Carrey but it's needed for the comedic effect to be priceless. A long list of supporting actors help draw out the big laughs and make the film that much memorable.I really enjoy Liar Liar even thirteen years after it's release. I think that a comedy like this, it's jokes are timeless giving it the ability to make you laugh no matter it's release. It's not just a funny film, but inspiring and emotional.

This movie is not good, yet I still laughed - exactly because Carrey's acting is so over the top from beginning to end, which means every 10 minutes or so some of his overacting will inevitably make you laugh.

117,MF210,Carrey is the main reason this movie works,8,16 January 2004,"My Rating: *** out of ****. If you are not a fan of Jim Carrey, then watch Liar Liar. I almost promise you that you will become a fan. In terms of his comedic performances, Carrey is at his absolute best here. I have this feeling that without Carrey here the film would not be much. The script is uneven. The writing for the comedy part is good and made atleast ten times as better because of Carrey's performance. However, the dramatic part is average writing at best and Carrey is no better than ok in those scenes. So if Carrey is not as good in the dramatic scenes is his performance uneven? A little but the dramatic scenes mean nothing when he is beating himself in the bathroom which is just one of several hilarious scenes. Its a shame to see how Carrey's comedic talents have gone down recently. If you want to see what I am talking about check out Bruce Almighty.
In terms of supporting performances, everyone does an adequate job. There are no standouts though. Jennifer Tilly looks great but does not make her character memorable. Actually, maybe the woman who plays Carrey's secretary (I forget her name) is a standout because she is actually quite good for limited screentime. I recommend Liar Liar for anyone who just wants to watch an entertaining movie. Its not a great film but you certainly won't be bored.

That makes for hilarious comedy.The movie is a little too goofy for any rating higher than an 8, though the goof factor is slightly lower (and certainly not the entire focus of this film) than usual. But, for what it was, I'm not sure I could ask for anything better.If you like Carrey, you will really like this movie.

120,richspenc,Funny idea and funny lines but major overacting from Carrey,6,3 February 2016,"In a film thats geniunly funny, the characters need to act silly but without them looking like they're forcing it. Jim Carry in 'Liar liar"" looks like he is forcing his silliness so intensely, he is just shoving it into everyone's face. He overacts so much it gets pretty irritating at times. Like for example in the boardroom scene, that scene would've been much funnier if Carry had still said all of the exact same things but if he'd just toned it down about 20 notches. And the boardroom manager's reactions were just as bad, so forced, annoying, and draining to watch, I felt like doing the same thing Carry did at the end of that scene, he fainted. The same problem occurred in a scene where Carrey's secretary asked him a question about if he would normally lie if she was asking him that same question. Just watching Carrey yell and kick and put his fingers in his ears and make and twist faces when she was trying to talk to him, I was not laughing even slightly, I was totally irritated. Carrey's exaggerated overacting continued through a lot of the film. And it's a damn shame because the other aspects of the film were pretty darn hilarious. The idea was a good one, about what Carry would say in given situations if he was unable to lie for a day. And many of the things he said were very very funny. Like what he said to the guy at the impound lot, or what he said to the cop pulling him over, or what he said to his different work colleagues at his law firm, or the things he said in the courtroom, or the things he said to his sexy client (Jennifer Tilly). Very creative, funny lines from Carry. It's too bad he had to overact so forcefully in the way he delivered them, so in your face. I could imagine Groucho Marx saying similar kinds of lines in a similar kind of plot, but it would be so much funnier due to the difference in the deliveries from the two different guys. Groucho did not overact like that. I did like the way Carrey bonded with his five year old son, and the scenes with his ex. She kind of reminded me of Jennifer Aniston. Carrey's ex's new boyfriend Cary Ewles was seen in a more American role, instead of the English acting and English accent he's been very good with in films like ""Princess Bride"".",Liar Liar
121,Torgo_Approves,Classic Classic,9,1 February 2007,"Being a major Jim Carrey nut, I have to say that this is his best comedy (his best serious movie being the mesmerizing ""Eternal Sunshine""), and the one that stands up to the most amount of repeated viewings. Not only do you pick up new jokes each time you watch it, but the jokes you were already aware of are no less hilarious on second, third, fourth, or in my case, thirty-seventh, viewing. This makes Liar Liar a classic comedy which will always have people who can appreciate Carrey's über-wacky sense of humour toppling over laughing. Unlike in Ace Ventura, Carrey actually has a solid (and original) plot to work with here, and the messages about the dangers of neglecting your family can be as touching as you want them to be - but I'd advice you just shut out the messages and enjoy Jim's madness.The movie is helped by a fantastic supporting cast, including a cute Maura Tierny as Fletcher's ex wife, Cary Elwes as the sublimely dorky stepdaddy, Jennifer Tilly as Fletcher's sexy client Samantha Cole, and the late Jason Bernard as the honourable (pfft) Judge Stevens. Justin Cooper is also good as Fletcher's son Max, which says a lot since most Hollywood actors his age seemingly just graduated from the Hayden Christensen School of Being Annoying.The script is incredibly witty and hilarious - those who said that Americans can't make comedy beyond the usual Adam Sandler jokes need to think again. Even the not-so-great lines are rendered hilarious by Carrey's relentlessly goofy delivery. Unless you're plagued by a severe broomstick/backside injury, I guarantee you that Liar Liar will have you rolling.The bottom line is: Liar Liar is a classic comedy which will never get old.

In itself it is a really great idea with a nice message, but I don't know if it is wise to end up with a pretty malty kitschy Hollywood in a movie that is about telling the truth because in the end everything turns out well and the couple comes back together is the biggest lie. I am sorry for the new friend of mine because I really think that he is a personable person and they deserve more than Jim Carrey's character who is just too unappealing.Despite his thin plot, Liar Liar is highlighted by Jim Carrey's exuberant physical humor, and the result is a laughing revolt that has helped to add to the comedian's appeal.But I like that the film has a relatively vulgar and rough way that makes it much more believable even though it is an adult film for children it is not held back when people shout at each other.despite everything I'm not happy with the end and wonder if that was really the right decision because Jim Carrey is unemployed at the end of the film, a good man with good intentions didn't get married, a boy who had the opportunity to get into a bigger one Moving to town continues to live alone with his mother in a small apartment, and the woman has come together with a constant lying to the idiots.Also, if he's such a good liar, I mean why doesn't Fletcher Reede just become an actor.
I know you don't have to do it with a hundred percent logic in the end it's still just a film but it has to be credible and meaningful somewhere.

Carrey's legal advice to his repeat offender client (""Stop breaking the law, a**hole!"") captures the flavor. There is also an underlying morality -- that your kids are more important than money, that some things are just wrong no matter how much you benefit from them, that material success is no reflection of character -- that helps the film rise above the level of purile humor.Okay, so you don't get profundity.

128,Snake-666,Heart-warming yet funny movie!,8,19 September 2003,"At his fifth birthday party Max (Justin Cooper) makes a wish that for just one day his inattentive father Fletcher (Jim Carrey) will be unable to tell a lie. Miraculously the wish comes true which causes countless problems for Fletcher whose job as a lawyer may be in jeopardy unless he is able to lie.Director Tom Shadyac teams up with Jim Carrey for the first time since the hilarious Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' (1994) and while one may expect more of the same, Liar Liar' benefits somewhat from having a tighter and heart-warming story rather than just the usual Carrey hijinks. The rubber-faced comic master Jim Carrey is at his best for this movie and while his off the wall antics provide seemingly endless humour, it is the poignant and touching scenes towards the end that really stand out in my opinion and prove Carrey's incredible acting ability. Once again Carrey steals the show but strong performances from Jennifer Tilly and Maura Tierney allow Carrey's natural comic ability to bounce around during the movie and makes for some humorous scenes in which Carrey was not involved.Credit should be given to writers Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur who managed to create an accomplished for Carrey to feed off, and feed off it he did. The screenplay is fairly tight and, despite a few plot problems, allows for a heart-warming story to be told despite the often complete lunacy being portrayed. The relationships between Max, Audrey (Tierney) and Fletcher are shown to the viewer in an almost profound and meaningful way. Despite Justin Cooper's limited acting abilities (though considering his age one can hardly expect an Oscar-winning performance!) the viewer is made to feel sorry for Max because of all the hurt he has felt in his relatively short life so far.As with most Carrey films there will be people who just do not find Carrey's unique brand of humour funny. The jokes are generally more mature than earlier films such as Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' (1994) and Dumb & Dumber' (1995) which might impress those who were less than impressed with the often infantile humour found in his earlier films but still might not be enough to make an impact on the non-Carrey fans. Personally I feel that Liar Liar' is Carrey's finest work to date which benefits from Carrey's bizarre behaviour, an enjoyably talented supporting cast and a strong script featuring some great gags, witty one-liners and a heart-warming story. My rating for Liar Liar'  8/10.",Liar Liar

130,darkjosh,Likeable Carrey Vehicle Bogged Down by Schmaltz,8,5 November 2000,"Liar Liar, Jim Carrey's return to comedy that made him a star (after audiences failed to appreciate his bitingly dark turn in 1996's The Cable Guy) finds him as a habitual liar/lawyer whose son decides to wish his father can tell nothing but the truth for an entire day.Carrey, as usual, turns in an all-out, body-flailing, mugging, and excruciatingly hilarious performance.  His comedic timing is impeccable, his physical antics singularly unique, and he constantly proves to be an inventively outrageous comic actor.  We can sympathize with his inability to lie as well, as we realize that we all lie to some extent.With such a big focus and so much more attention put on Carrey's dilemma, however, the rest of the cast is overshadowed.  Maura Tierney and Carrey Elwes' relationship isn't really too believable and Carrey's relationship with son Justin Cooper really feels tacked on at times.  While the film is certainly more accessible to a much wider age-range than some other of Carrey's crude, ill-spirited brand of humor, the family-film element brings down this movie.  This obviously isn't a family type film, so why bog it down with such a subplot?  Jennifer Tilly, on the other hand, fares well in her thinly-scripted role.
Besides the sometimes schmaltzy familial moments, Liar Liar is a much more likeable, restrained second collaboration between Carrey and director Tom Shadyac.  Newcomers to Carrey's brand of comedy will be pleased, as he isn't out-and-out crude and is generally likeable; die-hard Carrey fans might ask why he's not out of control.  Overall, however, a very enjoyable, light-hearted comedy.7 out of 10",Liar Liar

Jim Carrey portrays the separated husband and father of a young boy. He works as a lawyer. His son makes a birthday wish that he cannot lie for 24 hours. This sets up the comedy that follows. As comedy pieces, the boardroom meeting scene and the bathroom scene work best for Jim Carrey to display his talents.Best for Jim Carrey fans.",Liar Liar

Do some of us not recognize the truth when we're told it, like Fletcher's senior partner? it's too bad that these questions are put forward in something that appears to be just another silly comedy.OK, maybe that's the way to deal with these issues, in an entertaining vehicle, even if Jim Carrey goes over the top trying to suppress the truth from coming out of his mouth. This movie obviously isn't perfect but it's not half bad. To me, it's worth watching just to hear the lines: ""My teacher says that beauty comes from within.""

Liar Liar is the perfect comedy that can be also considered a drama because of the plot. Only Jim Carrey can act the way he acted in Liar Liar. He is definitely the king of comedy. I think in this movie, it made him a better actor because it made him the same insane funny guy yet it gave him a serious role when he needed to be a good father. Unlike the Majestic, where he was serious through out the whole movie, he was able to do many different things in this movie. This was a different kind of comedy.

The logline reads ""A fast-track lawyer can't lie for 24 hours due to his son's birthday wish after he disappoints his son for the last time."" The plot of this film is rooted in an inexplicable fantastic idea that, for an inexplicable reason, this one child's wish is granted for his birthday. Once you can adopt the plausibility of this logical fallacy, the rest of the film is an adorable concept. Watching through this film I can't imagine anyone else in the role of Fletcher Reede other than Jim Carrey. His over the top nature and larger personality definitely brought the role to life. I also enjoyed seeing Cary Elwes in the role of Jerry. Elwes is a fantastic actor and I feel like this role gave him something unique to work with. Other than the actor's performances, the writing in this film really brought out the humanitarian message of the importance of parental involvement in a child's life. To be fair Justin Cooper also translated the role of Max Reede into a character that the audience could deeply care about. In my opinion, I feel that this film really encapsulated what good chemistry between a writer, director, and actor can do.

Every lie Fletcher has told begins to unfold in a highly energetic and trademark Carrey comedic way. I have admired Jim Carrey since ""In Living Color,"" and was always afraid his slap stick comedy wouldn't always transfer to the big screen, but this film was pinpoint perfect. His over-the-top antics effectively added to the film versus taking away. I enjoyed this film when I watched it the first time and enjoyed a bit of nostalgia this time.I am sure that Jim Carrey probably had much more to in his tank, but Tom Shadyac did an amazing job keeping Jim reeled in for this part. The overall acting was superb, even though it did feel that Jerry played by Cary Elwes was a bit ""too cheesy."" Even though this film isn't very realistic, at least as far as the wish coming true, the consequences would be very accurate in ""real life"" making the storyline immaculate because it has a real lesson, always tell the truth.

He fails to show up at key moments in his young son's life, much to the annoyance of his ex-wife Audrey (Maura Tierney). After missing his son Max's (Justin Cooper) birthday party, Max wishes that his father would be incapable of lying for one day. This happens the night before Fletcher would be forced to give false testimony in order to win a prenuptial divorce settlement worth millions for a gold-digging wife (Jennifer Tilly). What follows is a series of genuinely comedic and heartfelt moments mixed in and marred with Carrey's annoying buffoonery and zaniness, and a dull, generic, and uninteresting plot.The funny moments come not from Jim Carrey's performance and wacky epileptic outbursts, but from the reactions of shock and dismay from the people he is forced to confront with the truth. Maybe it's just a personal thing, I've heard friends praise Carrey in this film (and others similar to it starring him), but I just find him incredibly grating and annoying. Which is very interesting because I love him when he plays a more subdued and down to earth role in more serious movies like ""The Truman Show"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", two of my absolute favorites of all time.This one isn't without its own merits, and there were times when I legitimately laughed out loud. It is funny. But at the same time the story is extremely dull and simple, fitting in with a whole list of generic 90s family comedies like ""Billy Madison"" and ""Kindergarten Cop."" Sure, it's got a fantastical element to it with Fletcher's inability to lie, but it's not all that interesting, as the nature of the curse is never given any further explanation and is only used to get Fletcher into wild and uncomfortable situations. The finale at the airport is also just really, really stupid.If you're a die hard Carrey fan, a fan of aforementioned hit comedies from the 1990s, or are just channel-surfing and have nothing better to spend ninety minutes of your time with, you might consider giving it a watch.

JJ's Verdict: Jim Carrey, at his rubber-faced best (or worst if you hate it, like me), manages to create a sweet and loving film that would actually be better off without him. The majority of his films are just vehicles for him with little plot, but this role wasn't written for him and actually has a good plot which Carrey unfortunately distracts you from.Liar Liar focuses on Carrey's Fletcher Redde, a fast-talking and outgoing lawyer who is ready to lie to win his case as quick as a flash. So when he lets down his 5- year-old son (Justin Cooper) yet again, making many lies in the process, the boy makes a birthday wish to prevent his dad from lying for a whole day. This wish comes true without any explanation and becomes problematic for Fletcher as he cannot lie during a case where the woman he is defending is certainly in the wrong. It is kind of ironic for Fletcher that although some aspects of his life go horribly wrong, his relationship with his son and wife improves drastically. Carrey, although he puts a huge amount of effort into the film, is just not funny when he goes into his ridiculous and over-the-top physical humour mode. Although it works when he is playing around with his son, it is just not a normal thing someone would do. He flaps his arms like crazy and pulls off almost impossible facial expressions but I'm afraid he just isn't funny. In fact the only time he is funny, is a scene where he isn't jumping around everywhere but just talking. I wish he would do more of it because he is actually a very funny guy which shows off in the worryingly hilarious credits (worrying because it is probably the best part of the film).Liar Liar is a loving and actually quite cute film, which also gives us some decently entertaining court scenes. It is just a shame its lead actor doesn't suit the role he is given.",Liar Liar

151,timefreezer7,Hilarious ! (and one of Carrey 's best),8,20 February 2003,"I am not a HUGE fan of Carrey . He did quite well in ""the Mask"" but I am really not a sucker for dum comedies with rubber-faced comedians (like Dumb and Dumber) . I also believed he was mediocre as the Riddler in Batman Forever and his stupid grimaces hurt quite a bit the ""Truman Show"" . This overacting was uncalled in Peter Weir 's film but what do we have here ? A solidly written comedy which really fits Carrey and gives him the chance to exploit his comedic talents but without being annoying . The result is (for the most part) amusing .OK lets recap the plot . Fletcher Reede (Carrey) is a successful lawyer who lies not only in courthouse but to everyone he knows including his colleaques and boss who he simply uses as a ladder for his career , his secretary whom he doesn 't give a raise , even his 5 year old son Max . Fletcher is divorced and Max lives with his mother Audrey (Maura Tierney) . Audrey divorced him because he didn 't invest much of his time to her but the problem still remains the same for Max . Fletcher is an absorbed workaholic and never finds time for his son (not even quality time that is). He keeps going back on his promises about picking up Max from school , playing baseball with Max etc , etc (If you have seen Hook with Robin Williams you already get the idea) . Audrey is fed up with Fletcher and has decided to move to Boston . Apparently Max will see his dad as frequently as now so she doesn 't have hesitations . Laura wants to start a new life with her new boyfriend Jerry . Jerry is a very ordinary calm little guy and although they are not officially engaged , they seem to be moving on tying the knot . At Max 's 5th birthday , Fletcher once again breaks his word and doesn 't arrive at the party . Max is so disappointed that the wish he makes blowing the candles on his cake is "" I wish that for 1 day my dad wouldn 't tell lies "" . The wish actually works and Fletcher is unable to spout (or even write!) even the simplest lie for the unbearable time course of 24 whole hours !!! The side effects are evident from the first moment since he reluctantly tells the truth to every question (and as the movie progresses we learn about other side effects due to this weird curse) . This is nearly the beginning for Fletcher 's torture since the truths embarrass him in front of the courtroom , his colleaques , his mother , his secretary and the police officer who checks his unpaid parking tickets !!!The premise was intriguing and Carrey is given free reign to spout the unpleasant truths in the most tragically funny way !! Carrey is superb in most of scenes like when he talks on the phone but he fails in others . One example is the scene with the pen which was badly staged . I would also like to complain about the scene where he beats his self up in the bathroom . It is totally unnecessary and at the worst case they should have at least shortened it . I especially liked the fact that the movie goes straight into action because the introductory scenes cover the first 10 or so minutes . Most of the consequences of Max 's wish are hilariously entertaining . The film is also short in order not to drag and be boring . Although it is inevitable that most of the viewers will simply focus on the gags and Carrey 's morphasms the writers pulled off some enjoyable messages . The satire on the profession of the lawyers is apparent . The usage and the benefit of lying in the ""adult world"" are also pointed out . As the plot unfolds we see Carrey actually redeeming his relationship with his fellow lawyers and his family even he was forced to outmouth bold and vulgar truths . For a family comedy Liar Liar actually contains a sensible amount of profanity although IMO it was used properly and rightfully "" I am gonna take it up to my tail pipe "" . If you have small children think twice before you let them see the film.Acting wise the team has done extremely well . This is not simply Carrey 's one man show - if it was it would fail . All the supporting characters chip in with their performances . Justin Cooper as Max plays convincingly the 5 year old character . Laura Tierney as Audrey is solid too . The show seems to be stolen by Jason Bernard as the strict Judge . He acts very well and is the nemesis of Carrey since if Fletcher embarrasses himself in court , the Judge 's wrath will be hard on him . Anne Haney is also a sensible supporting cast member as Greta , Fletcher 's secretary . She basically copycats her own role in ""Mrs Doudtfire"" (she was the social worker) but nevertheless with splendid results . She has more screen time and her constrained behavior is a hilarious opponent over Carrey 's fast and furious attitude . The rest of the cast is passable . Cary Elwes is literally unrecogniseable as Jerry , Audrey 's wannabe new husband . He appears briefly but is quite convincing in a very unusual for his standards buffoonish character .Liar , Liar is one of the most entertaining comedies of the 90 's . It is worth seeing even by non Carrey fans . For a fun evening with many laughs I recommend renting it.LIAR , LIAR 8 / 10",Liar Liar

The film is quite predictable, it has a lot of cliche moments and tons of tearjerkers that don't work out that well, imo.But even so, this film is just fun to watch. The acting is solid, the characters are mostly memorable, most of the jokes are legitimately funny. The pacing is also quite good, and I think that this movie keeps you engaged, even though you kinda know what's about to happen, generally, most of the time.So, yeah. Liar Liar is a fun little comedy , and I had a good time watching it. It's a movie to watch with someone who likes this kind of humor and just have a good time for a while without thinking too much. I give this a solid 7/10.",Liar Liar

Beats me why anyone would want to be the new Jerry Lewis, but My Lord, Jim Carrey surely does seem to want to be here. (Or perhaps he'd rather be a cartoon? He certainly seemed ideal for The Mask and The Riddler.)He mugs, he pratfalls, he does funny (?) voices, he even literally beats himself up, in pursuit of a laugh. But it's an awful lot of effort for a fairly poor return.The plot is basically the same as Bob Hope's Nothing But the Truth, with the addition of a mystical element (and does it strike you as strange how many adults are willing to believe that a child's birthday wish has come true, after about two seconds of convincing?) I bailed out before the no holds barred, all stops out sentimental redeeming climax, which was being telegraphed so heavily, I was suffering sugar overload ten minutes before it arrived.Reasonably entertaining. 7 out of 10 because I'm feeling generous.",Liar Liar

This love really is the heart of the film (no pun intended), but without Jim Carrey's over-the-top face-pulling performances, 'Liar Liar' would be relatively unspecial - a so-so plot, bland cinematography, an unmemorable score and more cheese than the dairy section of a supermarket.

My two favorites scenes are the speeding ticket scene with the cop and the elevator scene with him and the beautiful brunette; Not to mention there are quite the handful of classic moments in the film, the scene with him and his son at the school playground is a good one as well as the scene with him and the magic marker as well.  If you are a Jim Carey Fan, this is a must see, assuredly one of his most outstanding performances as a great comedic actor.

After the candles go out, Fletcher can't tell a lie for 24 hours and what a riot it's going to bring.Lair Lair brings out the laughs and brings out the excitement that you would expect from a comedy.

175,sundaresh-a,Is the lawyer(liar) above the law(lie) ?,1,2 June 2019,"Perhaps the answer to this question is also the answer to the pedagogical question of the relationship of god to good ? Is god above being good , or is he the embodiment and the personification if not also the pinnacle and the summit of all that is good ? Now all of us clearly have two nature's, one is our true or our real nature and our genuine personality and the other is our artificial or our feigned or our second nature and our affected personality. There is often a huge be it real or be it illusory discrepancy or gap between who we presume ourselves to be and who in fact we really are. Unfortunately, who we pretend to be, or try to be or pose to be is not who we really are, or even, deep down who we really aspire to be and really want to be. Whether such a worthy or unworthy desire of who we want to be, entertained by us is within the realm of possibility and is in-fact attainable and achievable especially by someone perceived to be as insignificant such as us, and in our situation, in our circumstance, in our plight and in our predicament is another question altogether ? We often project and portray an image of ourselves before the society and before this world which is not who we really are ? We are not honest in our dealings either with ourselves or with others and are prisoners of our own persona and do not tell people what we really think and what we really feel ? Now keeping up this image or facade is too much work, and on top of it, to make matters worse and much more complicated, the society and this world while itself miserably failing, tells us who we ought to be, and expects us to be someone or something that we intrinsically or naturally are not inclined to be or given to be, and do not fancy being, or even care to be. Neither are we outspoken in our opinions nor are we forthright and sincere in our attitudes and in our interactions. Besides apart from the native complex of putting up appearances there is the age old question, should we care for what other people think about us and the opinion they have about us or should we not, and are we in this world to please ourselves and to do our own bidding or are we in this world to please others(this world and this society) and to do others bidding ? Which of these two options is right ? We need to stop creating and to stop believing in myths about ourselves and about our true nature as well as about this world and its true nature, lay down our false ego and burn it for good, not just bury it for later resurrection and reemergence.

Jim Carrey literally carries the entire film, even though there are some great little performances scattered throughout as well. Jerry is perfect. Carrey does such a magnificent job with his humor, that you sometimes forget he is acting here. His love for Max is apparent, as are his horrible tendencies as a human being. By the end of the film, you are rooting for him the entire way. It's also one of the most quotable comedies ever. ""Yeah, in your bra!""

The Truth. - also known as what he is really thinking. And that is not the same thing.Trust Me. I would have benefited viewing this before the world met Impeached President Donald John TRUMP. Yup. The latest thing President Trump will stongly push back on and bravo The Donald.But when Liar Liar turned into Mr Reede (Jim Carrey) finds he really loves his son - I turned off mentally.And mused if one could curse or wish President Trump to tell the Truth under these terms until his Re-election in November 2020; well would it increase his winning majority?These terms? Saying what he really thinks - unfiltered. Until Election Day.A phew good men and women! The Handel of our generation.The truth is beyond his ""ken"". Are you really a billionaire?

This movie is stars Jim Carey and he plays a civil attorney called Fletcher Reed and if you can't tell by the title, he's well, a liar...i mean a lawyer (his son said that). Anyways, Fletcher is a compulsive liar, he will lie like every time he opens his mouth. he comes to pick up his son to spend the day with him and to take him to a wrestling show and sees his ex-wife (who likely divorced him due to his lying) and her boyfriend (who's on the dorky side). he takes his son to his office, only to find out that he's getting a case and now has to work and won't be able to take his son to the show. after he drops his son back off (on his birthday) he tells him that he'll see him at his birthday party, but big shocker here, he misses that. so his son wisely wishes for his dad to (for one day) not tell a lie and the wish comes true and quickly (and badly for Fletcher) he can't lie at all and tells the cold and blunt truth which hilariously gets him slapped or thrown out of a room. i won't give away too much, but basically this is a very funny movie and it's worth every penny to watch it. Jim Carey is just amazing in this movie and it's almost like the person who wrote this movie told Carey, ""you know what, just be yourself.""

His brilliancy is also previewed in other movies, such as, ""Ace Ventura: The Pet Detective"", ""Bruce Almighty"", ""A series of unfortunate events"", ""Yes man"". And around the Christmas holidays, we think of ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""The Grinch"" of course. Timeless classics! Last time I checked Mr. Carrey was the 69th highest ranked actor in the world according to www.IMDb.com. I am not surprised by this, but I am surprised he is not ranked higher. He is nothing short of a genius! He is one of my favorite actors. Along with Jackie Chan, Mark Vincent (AKA Vin Diesel), Will Smith, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Owen Wilson, Leo DiCaprio, Johnny Depp (definitely) and many more. Anywho, my point is this.

198,Swayze52,This movie screams Jim Carrey,10,13 June 2002,"I have never watched a movie where someone was so suitable to their role as this movie was to Jim Carrey(Besides Dirty Dancing and Patrick Swayze). It brings out the best in him. His love for his job, children,and his comical talent. When I came out of the theater after watching this film the first time,my ribs were sore. You can tell how much he loves children just by the way he relates to Max. I don't think that is all acting there. I don't know why he wasted his time with Me,Myself, and Irene. He was good in it, don't get me wrong, I just think that he is above a movie like that. He has tremendous comical talent, he doesn't need a movie peppered with profanity. I think the profanity kept Jim Carrey in the background, instead of the foreground. The movie would have succeeded if it had more Carrey antics and less people who like to curse! Jim is funny, they aren't!!",Liar Liar
199,sachinsethi-mib2011,Laugh-Out-Loud!!,9,27 November 2011,"Jim Carry, an actor that redefined the comedy genre by his marvelous comic timing and wit & humor. His movies have always been a laughter riot and have left millions of people laughing their hearts out seeing the way he delivers and performs. Liar Liar is another movie which has demonstrated that Why Jim carry is one of the best comedians of our times. This is a simple story about a Lawyer Fletcher Reede (Jim Carry) who relies heavily on his lying abilities to win cases. He has a broken marriage with and a beloved son whom he loves but can't spend time with due one reason or another and lies with him. The story then takes a twist when on his birthday, due to his father's inability to reach and in the spirit of disappointment, wishes for only one day his father cannot say a goddamn lie even if he wants to lie. Now, this wish comes true and now the fun part of the movie begins. The routine situations where earlier Fletcher used to carve the way out easily by lying would straight away bluntly say the Truth. But the only problem is speaking the Truth is that it hits at the person badly which he/she is not able to digest. There are umpteen instances which makes us laugh the hearts out by seeing Jim Carry perform all those silly and hilarious scenes. A few of the Noteworthy scenes are ""When He Jostles with pen about its color"", ""The Court Room Drama – Case of Mrs Cole"" and many more. This movie makes us realize how evolved an actor is Jim Carry. This movie is a must watch for all just for a simple reason to witness the greatness of Jim Carry, how he performs even the simplest scenes and takes it to the level which has been witnessed never before. I would give this movie a 9/10. Enjoy, Laugh and breathe!!",Liar Liar
200,nlasser,Boring,2,8 October 2015,"I think Swoosie Kurz sums it up nicely in the bloopers: OVERACTOR.There's nothing in this film except Carrey doing his over-the-top routine in front of a camera. He's talented, but it's just silly and at times even embarrassing. It seems as if the script was ""let's have a basic plot outline, and then have Carrey do whatever he wants in front of the camera for about 80 minutes. And that's a wrap"". This isn't comedy, there's nothing funny or entertaining about it, and even as slapstick it doesn't hold up. In his own words, had ""somebody stopped him"", the film would have benefited greatly.

The characters grow on you by the minute, they have personalities, they have chemistry, and the events often cause impact on later scenes.""Liar Liar"" was great, still great, with an on-point duration and dozens of guaranteed laughs and giggles to satisfy the ones looking for some numb-minded fun.Dispite it not exactly being for kids, it's still something very light to watch, and does no real harm.Plus maybe it'll even make you rethink your acts, and teach you a thing or two about moral ethics.",Liar Liar

This movie is about a man who is a victim of his own tongue.  As much as he wants to lie, he can't help himself.  The reactions on his face are hysterical when he realizes that what he wants to say won't be coming out of his mouth and the exact opposite does.  It gets just a little schmaltzy in regard to his relationship with his son and ex-wife, but it's not so sentimental that it is nauseating.  In fact, it adds a more human touch. When I originally saw this, I came out of the theater feeling like I had taken a little vacation from the cares of the world.

Look at the film as the consequences of telling the truth everyday in our consumer driven culture... You would be locked away, quite simply. OK its got the Hollywood ending where everything works out and the lead characters character is completely changed (noise of me vomiting) which turns me right off the film. But every instance of his truth telling is devastating for him and his career, co-workers, relationships etc.It raises some questions about a society where children are lied to, that is, don't tell lies but when you're older you have to tell lies... A society built on a series of lies breeds more lies until there is no truth anymore.So beneath this passable storyline is an interesting dissection of modern society and a truly twisted film! Try it, don't lie to people, most of us do it all the time and as the film shows it is so bad that entire vocations are based upon it and they are very highly paid.Oh yeah, Carey is hilarious but if you watch it just to laugh then OK, switch off and drift away and laugh as he tells a woman she has big breasts... which is interesting in itself, how do women get on so well in life when it is clear they are mentally lacking, oh right, its because men attach an awful lot of importance to the size of her assets... Every lie he fails to tell describes a part of society we cannot always say or see. Thats why it comes under comedy, if you told the truth no one would accept it.So yeah worth a watch!",Liar Liar

Not only was this a hysterical comedy, but it also had a serious family element to it that was crucial for Carrey's advancement into his role in ""The Truman Show"". This was an excellent stepping stone into the world of serious film.  This movie was a more acceptable ""serious role"" because he still had his moments to spaz out and make the audience laugh.

But oh, just how good it is to see Carrey playHis son Max Reede, however, seems unable to get an opportunity to enjoy his father's (Jim Carrey's character Flether Reede) company even less in Liar Liar.

218,lhansen14,Review of Liar Liar,8,18 April 2013,"Liar Liar is a hilarious comedy about a career-focused attorney, Fletcher Reede, who has a bad habit of lying in his personal as well as professional life. Ultimately, Fletcher's son, Max, becomes fed up with his father's lies and inconsistencies and decides to put an end to it using a birthday wish. Max wishes that for one day his father cannot tell a lie. Max's wish comes true setting forth a series of hysterical events and circumstances for Fletcher. This turn of events seems like a miracle to Max who can no longer be hurt by Fletcher's lies, but where Fletcher struggles the most is in his profession.Fletcher's strong reputation as a defense attorney is based significantly on his impressive lying skills, a theme that is portrayed throughout the entire film. (The word ""liar"" is even used as a pun on the word ""lawyer"" in the very first scene of the film.) Fletcher's professional performance is basically rendered nonexistent without the ability to lie, mislead, or withhold a truthful answer. Fletcher's struggle is most evident during the trial of an extremely important divorce case Fletcher plans on winning by having his client commit perjury on the stand. But Fletcher cannot even ask a question if he knows the answer is a lie. The film continues to focus on Fletcher's predicament as an attorney with the inability to lie. At the end of his struggle, but before the day has ended, Fletcher ultimately has a change of conscience about the way he has been living his life. He realizes that he has been living senselessly and that Max is his first and most important priority.Although the comedy is over the top at times, Jim Carrey plays the role perfectly and is as hilarious as he's ever been. I mean, how could we expect anything different? I laugh constantly every time I watch this movie and feel like it never gets old. I recommend it every chance I get!",Liar Liar
219,jhdenneracc,My favourite comedy of all time - very mild spoiler included,10,2 October 2014,"At this point in my life, I am not quite sure just how many times I have seen this particular movie. It is unbelievable that the movie is already 14 years old.I would not describe myself as the greatest fan of Jim Carrey, but in my view, he managed to get a fantastic balance between the obvious slapstick crazy comedy and pathos. I really care for the characters despite laughing a lot.I thought the director did a good job in allowing Jim some free reign and to use his talent as a vehicle.I thought Maura Tierney did a good job as well and Jennifer Tilly was very funny.The ironic thing is, I have not been able to prevent a little tear running down my cheek every time I see the scene at the end where he makes his promise to little Max.MILD SPOILERHe did lie, though. When Gretha asks him whether it is fair that her friend had to pay the robber who got hurt by a knife in her house, because of lawyers like Fletcher, he said no (to her initial surprise), adding that he would have gotten him TEN. (LOL) When she turns around angrily saying GOOD BYE MISTER REEDE, he blubbers, but then says, ""I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION!""

This film is one of the best comedies there is. Jim Carrey definitely proved his brilliance as comedian. He's the best comedian i know.Carrey plays a lawyer called Mr Reede and he's son Max wishes at his birthday party that he's father can't tell a lie for 24 hours. Reede's personal life starts changing. And he's taking Max he's son to the office and he promised to take son at wrestling but he lied. The part in the movie is really funny when he's at the elevator he came out in the office floor and everyone was ventilating with paper the bad air in there and Carrey said: it was me. Har Ha. it laughs every time.The acting is really good 8 points for that and 8 points for the movie. The side roles are good. I know Reede's boss is from Dharma And Greg TV series the Greg's father but don't remember he's actor name. I recommend this movie to all who likes a bit of comedy.,Liar Liar
225,mjaybib,Classic Carrey...,10,30 October 2004,"I've seen and read all the anti-Carreyisms about this film, but you should enlighten yourself and ponder the indisputable fact that Carrey made this movie work. The plot and cast are mediocre at best and without Jim's uncanny ability to add-lib there would be no humor, ultimately resulting in just plain blandness. Jim Carrey has taken a diverse leading actor role since his ""true real-self debut"" in Ace Ventura, and has never been overwhelming disappointing. Liar Liar would have been a sub-par comedy if Carrey was not present. Great actors have that effect on movies, in which they can either make it or break it!

We all know that lawyers are not that trustworthy and all dislike people that commit adultery (the main character does both a great deal). But yet we are rooting for him to get thru the legal mess he is in as well as make his little boy proud and win back the love of his ex-wife. I found myself laughing throughout the entire film from the beginning to the end. Great casting job with the supporting actors ... everyone here was amazing.

You could make a drama out of it or a hilarious comedy.Unfortunately this movie is neither: It lacks elegant and sophisticated play of word. The main actor resorts to spasms and stuttering rather than just saying in dry words what's on his mind.This movie is too far from reality to be really funny: It's hard to recognize yourself, saying ""yes, that's life"" and then enjoy a good laugh from that.I still like the idea of the movie and hope that somebody with more style will pick up the plot and put it into more sophisticated entertainment.",Liar Liar

You can really feel his struggle, which only makes it more hilarious. He's acting like his life depended upon it.Kudos to the director too, Tom Shadyac really did a good job on the timing, which is so important in comedy.Carrey can be annoying when not kept in check (I'm looking at you, Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls) but here he's really at his comic best.

Carrey does a great performance as Fletcher Reede, and found himself in a twister full of real hilarity. Carrey finally gets rid of the ""Ace Ventura"" stereotype, and manages a more fine style of comedy. I watched it in two languages (Original English and Spanish Dubbing), and I just can't stop laughing. His character is trapped in a hole, because of his son's wish and fights his way to get out of it. In the end, it's basically a story of a father and a son, and the fragile balance of their relationship, damaged for the lies of the father.

We laughed hysterically at the not-so-subtle innuendoes aimed at balancing career with parenthood (in Fletcher's case, being a defense attorney with questionable clientele and the premise of his having to tell the truth for 24 hours, due to his son's birthday wish, is brilliant.)

242,Species 8472b,"Carrey's best, too bad for the American moralism",8,7 January 2002,"In terms of comedy one of the best films I've ever seen, and Jim Carrey is really at it's best. One you can see over and over again. The one (major) drawback is this typical American moralism that HAS to be in every major American production. Annoying, but if you're prepared to see through that it's great fun watching this film. Don't forget to watch the bloopers at the end!!!",Liar Liar
243,winky963,Wrong hand?,9,21 May 2007,"I love ""Liar, Liar"" - I have to admit it's a guilty pleasure and one of my favorite Jim Carrey movies! There are so many memorable scenes and quotes. But I've read over the comments and the goofs and haven't noticed anyone mention the faux pas I noticed in the scene where he's in his office, trying to lie about what color the pen is. He takes the pen (and writes with it) with his RIGHT hand. Jim Carrey is left-handed ... at least according to what I've read. I wonder if this is a goof or filmed that way because of camera angles or whether he's just ambidextrous. Since I'm left-handed myself, I tend to notice when actors are also lefties. Anyway, I know it sounds nit-picky, but if anyone knows the answer - I'd appreciate a comment back.",Liar Liar
244,LoveBunny96,Need A Laugh,10,5 January 2009,"This was the most heart warming movie about what we all would love for our parents to be. And it does teach us something to tell the truth to our children because they can read us inside out. And it shows us that we all should take the time to spend time with our children no matter how things may get in our lives. I could not stop laughing it was so funny that i child could wish a birthday wish like that and it worked. And how Jim Cary did the part.I put this as a all thumbs up and will watch it again, again. This is the movie to make your day go by so good. Laugh out loud and let the good come out of yourself. I will be buying this movie too. Please watch this movie it is the best of the best you need to get a soda, popcorn and good place to sit and watch it The most funniest movie of what we all should do every day is tell the truth no matter what.",Liar Liar
245,violentjay5,Jim Carrey Is Just Brilliant!,9,6 May 2004,"One of Carrey's finest films (he has many mind you). Why this man has never received an Oscar nomination is beyond me but i am a big fan. But moving right along..Liar Liar is an hilarious comedy with a touch of drama to. Jim Carrey is just brilliant, absolutely hilarious but also handles the more emotional scenes in the film very well.Jim plays Fletcher Reede, a dedicated lawyer, so dedicated he has very little time to see his son, Max (Justin Cooper). After he fails to show up to his birthday party, Max makes a wish that for one whole day his dad cant tell a lie and the powers that be grant this wish causing a very big problem for Fletch as he has just took on the case of an adulteress housewife (Jennifer Tilly) who wants to keep her kids. Fletch discovers he will need to lie in order to win the case and the mayhem begins.Fletcher ends up losing his mind in the courtroom which leads to him beating himself up in the bathroom, an absolutely hilarious scene. With Fletcher not being able to lie his day goes from bad to worse with some hilarious Memorable moments.Once again Jim Carrey has delivered another fine comedy with plenty of laugh out loud moments, everyone else in the film are also very good. Jim Carrey fans and comedy fans in general wont be disappointed, this is a must see Carrey film. Brilliant!",Liar Liar
246,matt0489-514-604626,Liar Liar is a great example of a film that teaches the audience to appreciate their loved ones and to be honest.,10,28 October 2012,"Liar Liar stars Jim Carrey as the lying, self-full lawyer, Fletcher Reede. His life takes a turn for the worse when his son, Max, wishes Fletcher would not tell a lie an entire day. This came after Fletcher broke yet another promise and missed his son's 5th birthday party. The theme of this movie is honesty and appreciating your family and friends. During the film we learn that Fletcher and his former wife, Audrey were divorced due to Fletcher being unsupportive and breaking promises like he does through most of the first act of the movie. Fletcher finds out that Audrey and Max will be moving to Boston after Audrey's new boyfriend, Jerry, proposed to her. Audrey had mixed feelings about leaving from Los Angeles to Boston, as this would make it more difficult for Max to see his father, Fletcher. After missing Max's birthday party, Audrey decided to move to Boston with Jerry and Max. While blowing out his birthday candles, Max wishes his father could not tell a lie for an entire day. This wish comes true and Fletcher finds out the hard way. Throughout most of the movie Fletcher struggles to do his job and nearly loses his job, friends, and family during the way. He even gets put in jail and gets his car towed away. As mentioned, this film's theme is honesty. During the film Fletcher realizes he is a bad dad and even he knows it. During the day he cannot lie, he says ""I'm a bad father."" This saddens him and he realizes he is a bad father. The directory uses a low angle to put emphasis on Fletcher hitting rock bottom. The audience at this point begins to realize just how important it is to be honest with your friends and family. Fletcher wants to change, but his friends and family are sick of giving him second chances. By the end of the movie Fletcher is able to make everything right and get back together with Audrey and restart his family with Audrey and Max. Liar Liar is a great example of a film that teaches the audience to appreciate their loved ones and to be honest. Even though Fletcher is a successful lawyer, he made his way to the top by lying. He even got a case by agreeing to lie to the judge. However, we learn in this film that being a liar will eventually cause you problems. For Fletcher this happened all at once. This life lesson can be implied to anyone.",Liar Liar
247,jkibby,A little overacting and a loose script make for huge fun,8,25 December 2004,"Liar, Liar is a simple plot: An absentee professional attorney dad can't spend enough time with his son, and risks losing him should his ex-wife move out of town with another man. Repeated scheduling conflicts and moral discrepancies force Jim Carrey's character to break promises to his young son. The son, in a birthday wish, requests 24 hours during which his father cannot lie. The movie follows the attorney's path as he attempts, usually unsuccessfully, to navigate adult life and a legal career with perfect veracity.While Carrey's acting is, at times, a tad overpowered for the script's objective - this is a wonderful and fun film. My kids love it, even with a hint of innuendo peppered throughout.The final courtroom scene which vindicates Carrey and wins his case is so well done and performed that owning this movie is worth the price. The movie is huge fun, and one of Jim Carrey's best overall performances.Casting is simply impeccable, including Anne Haney and Jason Bernard in late-career performances. Casting for Liar, Liar could not have been improved in any way, with Swoosie Kurtz and Jennifer Tilly turning in excellent characters. We watched this again Christmas night '04, and the family enjoyed it (again).",Liar Liar
248,alanismorrisette7,I love this movie!!,10,27 February 2007,"I loved this movie, it's so funny :D one of the best comedy movies ever!!! It has (like many movies) a message, that it's best to tell the truth, but above all it was very funny. My favorite scene was: About Mr. Allen Miranda: Well, what do you think of him? Fletcher: He's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless steaming pile of cow dung, figuratively speaking. a moment passes and Mr. Allen starts laughing. The other board members follow his lead and start laughing also] Mr. Allen: That's the funniest damn thing I have ever heard. You're a real card, Reede. I love a good roast. Do Simmons. Fletcher: Simmons is old. He should have been out of the game years ago but he can't stay home because he hates his wife. You have met her at the Christmas parties, she's the one that gets plastered and calls him a retard, and you, Tom; you're the biggest brown nose I have ever seen. You have got your head so far up Mr. Allen's ass, I can't tell where you end and he begins. Mr. Allen: *roaring with laughter* Priceless! *Fletcher continues with every member* Fletcher: You have bad breath caused by gingivitis. You couldn't get a porn star off. Your hairpiece looks like something that was killed crossing the highway. I don't know whether to comb it or scrape it off with a shovel and bury it in lime. Loser! Idiot! Wimp! Degenerate! *Slut*! Mr. Allen: I like your style, Reede! That's just what this stuffy company needs - a little irreverence! Fletcher: Good! I'll see you later, dick-head! Great movie!!!",Liar Liar
249,Nikolaiwww,More than you expect.,8,3 July 2005,"It's Jim Carrey, so you expect he acting out. Well, he does, but only in one scene, which I find a bit misplaced (he beats himself up in the bathroom to get out of court). This movie is funny, sweet and can bring out both tears and laughter. This can be seen by the entire family. For once, Jim Carrey isn't just Jim Carrey, but a serious actor, and it is a nice supprice. He is really good.I recommend this movie.What I fell for in this movie was the father caught up in his work, really wanting, but not yet is in that place where he can be both, to be a father. The son, a sharp little fellow, makes a wish, that his father, the lawer, does not lie for 24 hours. Well, being a lawer unable to lie, is really well preformed by James.",Liar Liar

He is an awesome actor. The lines in this movie are hilarious...i couldn't stop laughing throughout the movie. I am telling everyone to sit down and watch this movie because i guarantee that you'll love it like i do!!! I love the claw scene with Max and fletcher. The assistant in Fletcher's office is hilarious...watch out for her wacky hair-do's and crazy clothes...she's the one to watch. When the lies ware off and Fletcher has to tell the truth, listen for his comments... Absolute crack-up...seriously, do yourself a favour hire this movie its awesome",Liar Liar
252,bab-29,I wish all men had to tell the truth for a day!,10,16 January 2006,"I wish all men (and maybe women, too) had to tell the truth for at least one day. Then people might actually get to know one another, good, bad, or otherwise!In the usual Jim Carrey style, this character in ""Liar, Liar"" is totally hilarious. He just can't seem to lie once he has been hexed. In order to see all the trouble he gets in and out of you must simply see this movie to appreciate one of Carrey's better movies.I'm not a particular fan of Carrey's, but I really did like ""Liar, Liar"" and have it as a part of my video library which consists mostly of comedy movies. Laughter is GOOD for you!",Liar Liar
253,coletcarlson,I Can't Lie This Movie Is Good,8,31 August 2018,"When I went to see this movie I had high expectations and I was not let down. I could barely stop laughing. If you love Jim Carrey this is a MUST-SEE. Alhought this film is really funny, it is more of an adult movie with all the sexual content and language. So if you have the night off and are looking for a good movie to make you laugh, this is the perfect movie to watch. Don't let the low ratings fool you, but to be honest everyone has their own opinion so the only real way to know if this is a good movie or not is to just watch it. But who are you to read some random review! Just go see it yourself!",Liar Liar
254,crazylad19,great movie,10,26 January 2006,"Liar liar is one of Jim Carreys finest movies EVER, he is the funniest actor and he really shows it in this movie, he has this thing about being very silly but it really works for him that made him what he is today. liar liar is very well written and very very well acted the producers should be really proud. of course the film is made even better by Jim Carreys yet again fantastic acting and general being silly. The movie is about a slick lawyer (Jim Carrey)who fibs a lot, until one day his son makes a wish on his birthday that he cannot lie for one day which comes true, he ends up being humiliated and of course very daft. its based on a true story honest.... mwaaaaaaaaaaaah",Liar Liar
255,tripleurlist,Jim Carrey at his best!,6,1 August 2010,"I watched this movie the other day and I have to admit I really enjoyed it! Jim Carrey's acting and comedy just makes me ask for more. This is a really fun movie. Its got a good plot and also a good message ""Lying will get you in trouble"".The story is pretty simple. Jim Carrey is a lawyer and his job naturally requires him to do a lot of lying. Due to his job, he frequently breaks the promises he makes to his son. His son tired of all this makes a birthday wish and for a day his dad could only speak the truth. The wish comes true and here's where all the fun starts.....But don't expect any surprises. This is just a fun movie to kill some time.Watch it if you want to have some laughs. If you are a Jim Carrey fan, this will definitely be a real treat! Carrey doesn't fail anywhere in the film.",Liar Liar
256,annierobinson-64055,"Definitely not a family film, not funny, just crude, rounded off with a bucket of cheese.",1,10 August 2019,"Terrible film filled to the brim with crude jokes and slapstick 'humour' that anyone with two brain-cells can only roll their eyes at.Utterly unbelievable that the apparently sane and sensible ex-wife wants anything to do with the Jim Carrey character rather than the thoroughly nice guy she gives up for a useless creep who eternally lets her and their son down, even if he is apparently a reformed person by the end.
Even when he is telling the truth, the main character seems to think it is fine to tell his young son that when his mother was pregnant with him she put on weight (wow what a crime) and he lied to say she didn't look bad when he actually thought she looked like 'a cow'. Well, that's a keeper ladies!Why do all the women in this film let him get away with it? Even his elderly secretary who walks out after learning how he had been underpaying her, mysteriously reappears at the end to bail him out of jail (without explanation) just so the film-makers can get her to make a creepy joke about him whether he's been molested in jail.Probably says a lot about the makers of the film that his revelation moment is the main character's about face in court where he suddenly argues in favour of the defendant he is meant to be opposing - arguing to the judge in a custody case that the father is a good guy despite the fact he just proved he married her as an under-age girl - apparently we're meant to shrug this off as a mistake any decent man might make?The whole film is yuk from start to finish. Only anyone who for reasons passing logic enjoys Carrey's manic gurning should watch, but definitely not with children present.",Liar Liar
