0,Leofwine_draca,Frivolous but fun,6,16 October 2015,"A typically bombastic and derivative actioner from the Bay/Bruckheimer team, this time taking the form of the age-old '80s ""buddy-buddy"" movie and reinventing it with the casting of not one but two black men in the leads: Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. Surprisingly, the central pairing is what makes this film work just fine. Despite the juvenile and unnecessarily crude script, Lawrence and Smith have a successful enough screen chemistry to provide a fair quota of laughs along the way (their pairing proved successful enough for an sequel in any case). In fact this film works just fine as an action comedy without ever breaking any new ground. Every scene and situation is sign-posted and clichéd but nonetheless I still found myself enjoying the laughs, antics and comedy situations in which the protagonists find themselves.The action sequences are often loud and quite splendid, although I would have liked a little more originality in the settings and events rather than the predictable old shoot-outs and gun-battles. At least the choreography is spot-on and the action is greatly improved by the bombastic music score which just pumps sheer adrenaline through the listener's system. Highlights to watch out for include an excellent car chase scene and the final, bloody battle at the aircraft hangar which doesn't disappoint in any respect.The usual cast of solid faces flesh out this big budget enterprise: a young and surprisingly beautiful Tea Leoni is the fragile but feisty witness; Joe Pantoliano is the stressed out superior and the sneering Tcheky Karyo is the evil European bad guy (a nice part but Karyo is grossly underused; to see him in a similar but far better role check out KISS OF THE DRAGON). Even Marg Helgenberger and Kim Coates have brief cameos. On a final note, BAD BOYS is one of those films where the two characters have to swap identities halfway through, leading to a major running gag which never lets up and provides some worthwhile situations and banter. Frivolous but fun entertainment.",Bad Boys
1,SnoopyStyle,Great buddy cop duo,6,6 April 2014,"Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) is a single playboy cop with lots of family money. Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) is strictly a family man. Together they are a fast-talking smart Miami buddy cop duo. Fouchet (Tchéky Karyo) is a wily ruthless criminal leading a crew that robs the police evidence room of a large stash of heroin. The guys need to recover the heroin before others come in to take over the case. Mike's hooker CI encounters one of the crew. She is killed while her roommate Julie Mott (Téa Leoni) witnesses the murder and escapes. She is willing to only talk to Mike, and Marcus ends up pretending to be Mike.This is Michael Bay's big screen directorial debut. He already has much of his bombastic style. The best thing in the movie has to be the brash comedy duo. The movie sizzles every time they are together. The biggest problem is the switched identity gimmick. It's stupid and the movie struggles under the premise. There is some comedy derived from it but somebody needs to come up with a better excuse for the switcharoo. This is loud. This is cool. This has a great duo. But it's also overblown.",Bad Boys
2,claudio_carvalho,"Although Full of Clichés, An Excellent Action Movie",8,16 November 2004,"The honest and efficient Detective Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) is a married cop with three children, having difficulties for the payment of his mortgage and for having sex with his wife. His partner is the also honest, efficient and wealthy Detective Mike Lowrey (Will Smith), who inherits a large amount from his family and although living like a playboy, has not resigned to his position in the police department. After a daring robbery of heroin from the police department stores, the two detectives try to find some clue about the gang. The chance appears with the hooker Julie Mott (Téa Leoni), the witness of the murder of a 'working girl' friend of her. The detectives are assigned to protect her and chase the killers. Although full of clichés, 'Bad Boys' is an excellent action movie, in the same line of 'Lethal Weapon'. There are lots of funny parts, Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are excellent as the two partners with different behaviors and Téa Leoni is gorgeous. I saw this movie a couple of years ago, when Will Smith was an unknown actor, and now I saw it again on DVD, with the intention of watching 'Bad Boys II'. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'Os Bad Boys' ('The Bad Boys')",Bad Boys
3,kosmasp,Miami Bad Boys Vice,7,5 May 2021,"When Miami Vice gave us Cops who cared very much about their appearance, not just clothing wise, but also what car and other things they would have ... who would have thought that we still get it referenced so many years after that? And beginning in the same or a similar vain, that we or at least the bad guys would not guess that they would be dealing with cops in a race car! But here we are ... the first movie of ... two at first but as I understand a fourth one is in the works.Michael Bay and Bruckheimer make a great team when it comes to entertain viewers, without challenging them too much. This has some things that may rub you the wrong way (in an offensive kind of way, the ""switcheroo"" as I call it but also depiction of gay people and things that could easily be called sexism) ... I'm not telling you how to feel about those things or if you should feel offended. I am giving you information and you deal and work with it the way you feel is the right way to deal with those things.Having said all that, there is comedy and there is action here ... and there are quite a few good actors in front of the camera! Even the first encounter, which I sort of laid out in the beginning, has some actors at least I am familiar with and some others may know too! Even if it is only the SoA regular and not the woman who distracts our two main heroes - although it's more Will Smiths Mike Lowry who has eyes for her - giving us an early glimpse on their (cliche filled) characters.Again, I can't tell you to care about Political correctness or not - if you can work with what they give you here ... you'll have fun, that much I can tell you - I mean whatcha gonna do, right?",Bad Boys
4,gavin6942,Probably the Best Black Action Film I've Seen Without Denzel,6,2 July 2007,"Some very skilled gang members break into the police station and steal millions of dollars worth of drugs. A young woman, Julie Mott (played by Tea Leoni) is witness to a murder. She seeks the protection of Mike Lowrey (Will Smith), whom she's never met, and ends up living with his partner, Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) who pretends to be Mike. All this while there's still a crime to be solved...I liked this movie. I didn't think I would. It was very black (by which I mean the actors talked as stereotypical black men would and lived like stereotypical black men would, which I can't identify with). It was directed by Michael Bay (who, I have to concede, knows how to make a good car chase). And it starred Martin Lawrence, who is generally not funny (although I liked ""Black Knight"") and something of a poor man's Eddie Murphy (which isn't really a compliment).But for kicking back with my dad and a half dozen cans of Old Milwaukee, this was alright. Plenty of guns and bombs and stuff I normally don't go for, but seem so much better when you're hanging out with your father half in the bag. And it had Tea Leoni, who has a very strange quality about her. She's got almost an exotic look which makes her attractive, though not in any conventional way. Since her role was basically just to be ""the chick"", she did more than alright (she had a fair share of action scenes).I watched this a while back, and don't really remember it well enough to analyze particular parts. The ""pretending to be your friend"" plot line is nothing new, and there's certainly nothing new about cops shooting and blowing things up (""Die Hard"", ""Lethal Weapon"" both do it better). But if this is what you want fro ma movie, and want to hear ""The m-f word"" a few dozen times, this is a movie you'll get into. Oh, and they drive really nice cars. Michael Bay loves nice cars.",Bad Boys
5,jboothmillard,Bad Boys,7,31 October 2005,"This was the directorial debut of Michael Bay (Meat Loaf: ""I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)"", The Rock, Armageddon, Transformers), the second major movie role for the star of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and the movie debut for the fellow comedian known for his self-titled sitcom. Basically, Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence), a hen-pecked family man, and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith), foot-loose and fancy-free ladies' man, are detective partners in the Miami Police Department, and lifelong friends. Their latest case is investigation involves $100 million of seized Mafia heroin stolen from a secure police vault. Internal Affairs suspects that it was an inside job and threatens to shut down the entire department unless they recover the drugs within five days. Lowrey asks one of his informants and ex-girlfriend Maxine ""Max"" Logan (Karen Alexander) to look for people who are newly rich and therefore suspects. She and her best friend Julie Mott (Téa Leoni) pose as hired escorts to meet with Eddie Dominguez (Emmanuel Xuereb), a former crooked cop. They are soon interrupted by Dominguez's French drug kingpin boss Fouchet (The Missing's Tchéky Karyo) and his henchmen Casper (Frank John Hughes), Ferguson (Vic Manni) and Noah (Marc Macaulay). Dominguez and Max are killed, Julie witnesses the murder, and manages to escape before the criminals can kill her. At the police station, Julie insists on talking only to Mike Lowrey. With Mike away, captain Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano), knowing she has not met Mike, forces Marcus to impersonate Lowrey to talk to her. At her apartment, Marcus and Julie are attacked by one of Fouchet's henchmen, whom Marcus kills. When they rendezvous with Mike, Marcus and Mike have to impersonate each other, and they keep it up in Julie's presence. Looking through mugshots, Julie identifies Noah as one of the henchmen. Mike and Marcus go to Club Hell, one of Noah's known hangouts. Julie is told to remain in Mike's apartment but wants vengeance for Max's death and goes to the club armed with a handgun. Marcus is spotted by Casper; Marcus knocks him unconscious during a bathroom fight. Julie tries to kill Fouchet but Marcus stops her. The criminals chase the trio, until Mike kills Noah. The three manage to get away but are caught on camera by a news helicopter and later seen by Marcus's family. Mike and Marcus meet their old informant Jojo (Michael Imperioli) and learn where the chemist is who is cutting the stolen drugs. The three return to Mike's apartment, where Marcus's wife Theresa (Theresa Randle) confronts them, and Julie realises they have been impersonating each other. Fouchet's gang shows up and kidnaps Julie. Mike and Marcus's department is shut down by Internal Affairs. Despite being reassigned, Howard delays the order, giving Mike and Marcus more time to solve the case. They find out the police secretary Francine (Anna Thomson) is Dominguez's former girlfriend after accessing his private police database profile. Mike, Marcus and detectives Sanchez (Nestor Serrano) and Ruiz (Julio Oscar Mechoso) head to the airport to face Fouchet and his men. After a fierce shootout, the remainder of Fouchet's henchmen are killed, including Casper and Ferguson, and Julie is rescued. They chase a fleeing Fouchet and force his car into a concrete barrier. As Fouchet tries to flee, Mike shoots Fouchet in the leg and arrests him at gunpoint. After a tense moment, Fouchet draws another gun, but is shot by Mike before he can fire, avenging Max. An exhausted Marcus leaves Julie with Mike and heads home, eager to be reunited with his wife. Also starring Marg Helgenberger as Alison Sinclair, Saverio Guerra as Chet the Doorman and Lisa Boyle as Girl Decoy. Smith and Lawrence are a terrific buddy cop duo, wise-cracking and bantering with each other, the plot is almost irrelevant, there are bits that really make you laugh, and the explosions and chase sequences are exciting, overall it is an energetic and likeable action comedy. Will Smith was number 51 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",Bad Boys
6,ccthemovieman-1,"Fabulous Opening, But After That.....",2,22 June 2007,"Wow, this had a great beginning. The opening credits scene was as good as the best of the James Bond flicks. Those overhead shots of Miami at night were awesome, too. Unfortunately, a few minutes after that great opening, the movie starts to go downhill and then accelerates most of the rest of the way.The two leads, played by Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, spend most of the film yelling at each other. That's entertaining? No. The action scenes are very good, but these stupid characters are just annoying and wear thin very fastIn this end, all this is, is another overly loud, stupid buddy movie with ridiculous profanity, and a very predictable script which includes an easy-to-guess ending. I am a guy, and I love crime movies and a good action flick....but this is just mindless machismo, led by one of the worst examples of that in the history of Hollywood: Mr. Smith.Why does Smith always have to prove to every audience that he is the coolest, hippest, meanest, nastiest dude on the planet? Is he that insecure? The same, to a lesser extent, goes to Lawrence and to producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay, who never any object that wasn't worth blowing up on screen.",Bad Boys
7,Tweekums,Solid action with a good number of laughs,8,23 February 2017,"Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett are two Miami narcotics cops. Mike is privately wealthy and has a reputation as a ladies' man; Marcus is a family man. When a gang of thieves break into the police evidence room and steal $100,000,000 worth of heroin they are put on the case. Mike asks various contacts including former girlfriend Max to keep an eye open for anybody who has suddenly come into money. Max finds one but doesn't live to tell anybody; her murder is witnessed by her friend Julie. Julie gets away from the killers and tries to contact Mike; unfortunately he is out of the station when she calls so Marcus is ordered to pretend to be Mike. Now he must keep her safe and find out what she knows while the real Mike has to play Marcus something that isn't easy when he has taken Julie and her two dogs to Mike's luxury apartment! It isn't easy for Marcus either as Mike is staying at his house. The level of danger increases for all of them as they close in on the killers.If you are looking for a film with lots of great action, plenty of laughs and fun characters you could do a lot worse than this. The central story is interesting and Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have a great chemistry as Mike and Marcus respectively; it is easy to believe they have been partners for years. Téa Leoni is also impressive as Julie; a spirited character rather than just a damsel in distress. The rest of the cast are pretty solid too; most notable Tchéky Karyo as the villain Fouchet and Joe Pantoliano as Captain Howard, Mike and Marcus's under pressure boss. As one might expect from a film directed by Michael Bay there is plenty of action including an explosive finale. Thankfully this action is not the obvious CGI we get in more modern films. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting a fun cop movie with loads of action.",Bad Boys
8,BA_Harrison,Not bad.,7,18 June 2020,"This is a fairly typical Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer action movie from the 90s, a classic slam-bang buddy cop set-up, the gimmick being that the protagonists are black, allowing for lots of rap music and 'Yo mama' jokes to go with the orange filters, gunfire, hot women, fast cars, and slow motion.Will Smith plays womanising cop with a trust fund Mike Lowrey, while his less affluent partner, married man Marcus Burnett, is played by Martin Lawrence. After a heist relieves the precinct's evidence storage room of a massive amount of uncut heroin, Mike and Marcus are given the task of finding the people responsible. Murder witness Julie Mott (Téa Leoni) is the key to cracking the case, but keeping her alive proves risky for the guys, especially for Marcus, whose wife Theresa (Theresa Randle) is sure that her husband isn't been honest with her.Explosive finalé excepted, Bad Boys is surprisingly light on the action, the emphasis being on the abrasive friendship of the two wise-cracking cops. Amazingly, director Michael Bay makes this work for the most part, the film not quite so rapidly edited and migraine inducing as his later efforts, and his handling of the many clichés - the grouchy police captain (Joe Pantoliano), the foreign baddie (Tchéky Karyo) and the spunky heroine with great legs -- is all done with a knowing affection for the genre (plus it's nice to have a bad guy who is not British for a change).With Smith on top form, Lawrence cracking some great funnies, and Leoni in a short skirt, this is undemanding fun for all '90s action buffs.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",Bad Boys

There is plenty of shooting and blowing up, especially at the end of this film.Helgenberger plays it straight and then provides comedy relief.While the language in the film becomes salty at times, unfortunately, it is needed and you might even become calm with it eventually.",Bad Boys

11,hitchcockthelegend,What you gonna do when they come for you?,8,20 June 2020,"Just great high octane action entertainment. You could argue it's a shallow exercise, but with outstanding action set pieces and a couple of leads hitting chemistry gold, it's an action junkies dream. 8/10",Bad Boys
12,jotix100,The Lawrence and Smith show,5,20 February 2009,"The producers of this film appear to be parodying some of their own better made action features involving two cops. In this case, narc cops working in Miami. The director, Michael Bay, indulges his two stars in what becomes a show where the two leads trade barbs and funny lines, perhaps to amuse themselves. This is a total rip off of much better cop films the producers have made.The irritating factor of watching the film resides in Martin Lawrence's take on one of the cops, the supposedly normal Marcus. He has a knack for turning serious situations into his screen ""shtick"". Will Smith doesn't fare much better.As an action movie, it owes big time to the crisp cinematography of Howard Atherton who gives it a great look and captures the Miami scenery in its splendor. The art direction of Peter Politanoff takes us to some out of the way places and even familiar ones around Sun City. The music score is by Marc Mancina.This is highly recommended for fans of the two stars who will probably have a ball watching their idols.",Bad Boys
13,lastliberal,You know you drive almost slow enough to drive Miss Daisy.,7,5 October 2008,"What better movie to watch while I am waiting for the Miami game to start. This action-packed buddy flick situated in Miami had just what I needed to get pumped up.Believe it or not, this is the first time I have seen it. Martin Lawrence is really not my cup of tea, and I have only occasionally enjoyed Will Smith (Independence Day, for one).Together they were really funny. It was almost as if they were married. The gay reference by Téa Leoni was really on target. I don't know why she doesn't get more credit as she was funny, and really hot in this flick. Teresa Randall wasn't too bad herself.My man Tchéky Karyo from Nikita is always a pleasure. he makes one hell of a bad guy.I'm pumped to the max and ready for some football!",Bad Boys
14,Calicodreamin,Great action/comedy,7,8 November 2019,"Bad boys has a great combo of action and comedy. Smith and Lawrence's characters are well developed and have good chemistry. The supporting actors and actresses are good actors and really add to the movie. The action scenes are really great and have a real vibe to them. The plot makes sense and has good flow, but for me the movie is too long. I think it could have been streamlined by getting rid of some unnecessary filler scenes.",Bad Boys
15,Boba_Fett1138,The beginning of a new action movie era.,8,11 September 2007,"Michael Bay is a much hated director but I don't think that this is right or really justified. Fact simply is that he has changed and upgraded the action genre over the past years. He gave action movies more style and certainly also made them more fun and entertaining to watch. It was never really a genre that was ever being taken serious as a genre that delivered real quality or any new stars. Now days the action genre is definitely taken more serious when comparing it to 15 years ago. If it weren't for him, we would probably now still be stuck with overblown and stupendous Steven Seagal and Chuck Norris type of action movies. The fact that studio's dare to spend lots of money on action movies now days shows how well the genre is doing, by both a wider and new range of public but also certainly the critics. As long as he doesn't attempt to make any ""Pearl Harbor"" type of movies again, I'm happy to continue watching his movies and will always be eagerly awaiting his next project.""Bad Boys"" is Michael Bay's first movie and its also one of his best. It's fast, stylish, action filled, great characters but above all it's fun!Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are a golden duo. It's no coincidence that the best moments of the movie features the both of them in those sequences. The two of them are the main reason why the movie is so much fun to watch. The dialog and chemistry between the two are great! This movie also marked the big breakthrough of both actors. Lawrence decided to keep continuing on the comedy-genre road, while Smith by now is fully taken serious as an Hollywood actor, that still is also a much demanded and popular one, who is also perfectly capable of playing serious roles and already is a two time Oscar-nominee.The two of them will make you almost forget that the movie also has a truly splendid supporting cast, such as Téa Leoni and the always great Joe Pantoliano in a typical Joe Pantoliano-role. The movie its main villains is being played by Tchéky Karyo. I really like this guy and he serious needs to make some more Hollywood-type movies! His character is this movie is perhaps a bit underused and not featured enough but still Karyo adds a lot with his acting to the movie.The movie is made with lots of style, that gives the movie a real fast and pleasant pace and also uplifts most of the action sequences. You know, this movie really didn't had the highest of budgets but they managed to do an extremely good job with the resources they had. Even though the movie isn't, it still looks and feels like an $100,000,000 production. There is never a slow or dull moment in the movie and it features lots of action, such as gun fights, big explosions and car chases. You know it's one of those movies in which the story really isn't that important. They basically could had given these guys anything to do and the movie still would had remained just as much fun to watch. It's a movie that even makes you forget that there is a story! You just sit back and let this movie entertain you. It's a movie that never looses any of its power, not even now almost, 15 years later. I loved this movie in 1995 and I'm still loving it now.The fact that this movie is great looking is also thanks to the editing by genre specialist Christian Wagner, the musical score by Mark Mancina, who was really great and hot in the '90's and the touch of producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, who definitely helped to evolve the action genre.Highly fun and entertaining! Definitely a recommendable movie!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Bad Boys
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Pretty entertaining buddy comedy,7,25 July 2004,"The 'buddy comedy' genre is fairly well-known, there have been plenty of them, all of them primarily based on the basic idea of having two main characters who are, well, buddies; they act like friends to each other, they get in fights, they help each other out, they compliment each other. It's a fairly easy genre to master, and an easy way to make a good movie. This is one of the best examples, since Smith and Lawrence really do compliment each other so well; Smith's the sleek, cool one who is popular with the ladies, while Lawrence is often nervous, and pretty much a direct opposite of Smith. They have pretty good on-screen chemistry, too; you believe that these are good friends and partners. My only real problem with the film is the way the comedy almost all is generated by stereotypes, and, worse, the age-old complications that arise from certain situations. I think that's a little unoriginal, but, hey, that's the only complaint about it, and the film does have some very entertaining comedy parts. The plot is pretty good, it keeps the film going and supplies every single scene with comedy, action, or both. It takes off immediately, and keeps a good pace throughout the 2 hour duration. The acting is all pretty good. The characters are well-written, well, for stereotypes at least(because, lets face it; they are). The comedy is well-done and often made me laugh out loud, and, believe me, I am not, in any way, shape or form, a Will Smith fan. The action was well-done too, intense and exciting. The film, all in all, was pretty good, very entertaining. For a buddy comedy, it's good. For an action comedy, it's good too. I recommend it to all fans of action comedies, and buddy comedies. 7/10",Bad Boys
17,FlashCallahan,You forgot your boarding pass.......,8,26 February 2012,"Marcus Burnett is a hen-pecked family man. Mike Lowrey is more of a loose cannon. They are partners on the Miami Police Department, and they are about to take on a highly dangerous case.100 million dollars in heroin, from the biggest drug bust of their careers, is stolen from police headquarters....A few years before this movie was made, the buddy cop genre was drying up. We only had Riggs and Murtaugh for company, but they were getting to family friendly, and rather than killing the bad guys, they were subliminally telling us to give up smoking and not to eat tuna.This movie is groundbreaking for many reasons.It made Smith a bona-fide Hollywood star.It gave us Michael Bay and his editing.It's Lethal Weapon for generation X.It made Martin Lawrence endearing.Other than that, it's nothing new, but the chemistry between the two leads, and the fantastic, stupendous set pieces, make this stand head and shoulders above other, formulaic action movies.The story is nothing new, the sub-characters are straight out of 'last Action Hero', and despite Tea Leoni doing nothing but strange leg exercise, it never fails to entertain.It may have dated a little in seventeen years, and Smith is a little annoying now, but you can watch this movie through rose tinted specs, and enjoy the most orange action movie you will ever see.",Bad Boys

""Bad Boys"" offers nothing new, but the archetypes work so well here that it's easy to overlook. Joe Pantoliano is genuinely funny when he's losing his cool, and the movie really rides on the chemistry between Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. It's a bickering spouse partnership, and what could've been a stale formula outing turns into a great mismatched cop movie.But it's also a movie that's totally within Michael Bay's wheelhouse; some sort of loud high-gloss MTV genre flick.

21,StevePulaski,"When you're in a small box, whatcha gonna do?",6,6 May 2012,"Michael Bay's Bad Boys, his first feature film, is probably his best. But that sure isn't saying much. He has always favored the route of bloated and stupid rather than coherent and intelligent, and he is anything but subtle in his first feature attempt as a director. Consistent readers of my work know I have an incredible disdain for the director/writer himself, but I in no way believe he is a bad, horrible person. I'm just saying he writes, more often than not, bad, horrible films. I have no doubt in my mind that he is capable of writing and directing a good film, but he gets too involved with things that should be the secondary elements in a film. He brings background elements firmly into the foreground, and that poses a big problem.The story centers around Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith), two detectives for the Miami-Dade Police Department, who are called in to hunt down a $100 million worth of heroin that was intricately stolen from a secure vault. One of the petty criminals is Fouchet (Karyo), who early in the film shoots one of two escorts in his mansion. The other one named Julie (Leoni) will only speak to Lowrey on the count of her friends' relationship with the man.When Julie calls in about the murder, Lowrey is away, and the Captain forces Burnett to pose as Lowrey so as not to lose a valuable witness. He accepts, and off on a tangent we go through what is soon to be the long, eventful odyssey of mistaken identity. While Burnett puts Julie under protective custody, both the men work in seclusion to try and capture the drug lords and get their stash back.While not wonderfully executed, I can at least say that Bad Boys is fun and provides lightweight entertainment for those seeking it. It isn't the finest example of goofy, popcorn entertainment that I have encountered, but I can recognize the film has an audience that will be satisfied with the turnout, much like those horrifically awful Transformers films Bay so contently puts out. Just because I can respect that there is a fanbase for his material, doesn't mean I am forced to sit back and like it, and that's why I choose to voice my opinion on a lot of his films.Lawrence and Smith do a great job working together, both having expressive personalities and cheery, electric chemistry that provides kinetic energy to the screenplay. Although it appears as if their roles were switched. I have a hard time believing that Lawrence's Burnett is the mostly straight-laced cop with a family, and Smith's Lowrey is the fearless player with an act for taking advantage of women by having a different one every night. During the course of the film, I couldn't help but feel it should be the other way around. If that's a bit too vague to try and grasp, let me try and put it this way; has Will Smith ever been given a lesser role in any of his recent filmography? I too discovered that the original title for Bad Boys was going to be ""Bulletproof Hearts"" with SNL buds Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz taking the roles of Lawrence and Smith. While I would've adored a buddy-cop comedy with Carvey and Lovitz as the leads, I couldn't quite grasp the idea of two cleaned-up guys like them playing dirty cops. For better or for worse, the roles were given to the right people.While the film provides light escapism, Bad Boys, however, makes one near-crucial mistake; it is too heavy-handed and over-produced to classify as campiness, which is what it is seemingly trying to achieve. It's a tad too long, shot like a music video (what else do you expect from Bay, who started out in that field?), and is viable because of its leads who have a charming chemistry and their commitment to a project so quirky and arbitrary. But, really, when you're working on a glossy piece of Hollywood, brought to you by someone whose talent is in the visual effects field and not much else, and are sometimes trudging through muddy clichés, whatcha gonna do?

My only thing that was holding me back from seeing this film was Martin Lawerence. For the most part, he annoys me and it seems like he has the same part in every movie, but I have to admit, I could tolerate him during this film.Marcus and Mike are two partner cops on the force together, they have been friends for a long time, Marcus is a married family man and Mike is still living up his one night stands. The boys are assigned to a missing dope case that turns into murder and helping the only witness, Julie, survive. Marcus takes the role as playing Mike to make sure that his family is safe, but you can guess how this story is going to turn out from here.Bad Boys was a pretty good buddy cop film, but it could have been funnier. Still, it was more original than most buddy cop films, considering that at least these bad boys had been friends for a long time. I would recommend Bad Boys for action movie lovers, it's worth a good watch, otherwise, it's an OK film for any average film fan.6/10",Bad Boys

One of the better flicks to come from the Bruckheimer and Bay team who brought us such Hollywood suck-excesses as ""Pearl Harbor 2001"", ""Bad Boys"" has lots of personality and sequel potential in addition to an abundance of raw action including firefights, chases, pyrotechnics,  etc. Worthy of a second look by action junkies or any one old enough for an R rating who missed it first time around.",Bad Boys

Maybe it's because he didn't have the budget to put in all of his shenanigan. So yeah, Bay's first few movies were fine as entertaining popcorn flick. Until his success got to his head and the guy went overboard with everything. To the point where his films started to give me headaches from all the explosions and no substance at all. At least ""The Rock"" has memorable scenes when it came to the action sequences. With some entertaining dialogue that didn't have that much depth to it. But it was entertaining never the less. As a matter of fact in today's standard this would have been a pretty decent straight to DVD movie. It's a generic buddy cop action movie. But what makes it work is the chemistry and the character dynamics between the two leads. Mike Lowrey(Will Smith) as the gun toting, charismatic womanizer and Marcus Burnett(Martin Lawrence) as the overly serious family man that exaggerates things. The interaction between these two during chaotic circumstances is to a certain extent amusing. 6.2/10",Bad Boys

29,Pjtaylor-96-138044,What you gonna do?,6,22 May 2021,"'Bad Boys (1995)' is your typical orange-and-teal, hyper-sexualised 90s action flick. It owes practically all of its success to its two stars, with Lawrence and Smith's constant banter being pretty much the only interesting thing in the entire affair. I mean, it's not like the movie is boring or anything. It's just very by the numbers and isn't all that compelling. It's entertaining enough, I suppose, for a bit of brainless fun, and I will admit that it has one or two genuine laughs. Most of it is just pure nonsense, though. The plot, for instance, is all over the place. It's almost impossible to follow, in a sense, because it just sort of happens. At the same time, it isn't all that important. The flick's focus is certainly on the odd 'in disguise as each other' dynamic that keeps its charismatic leads on their toes. Their relationship is a decent amount of fun, but it's a bit frustrating because it never really evolves (and barely has any consequences). Still, it gives the movie an undeniable charm. Ultimately, the picture is relatively enjoyable when it's underway. It's quite forgettable, though, and it isn't exactly a genre defining experience. 6/10.",Bad Boys
30,bowmanblue,Bad boys. Fun film,7,9 August 2014,"Back in the nineties there was one name that was becoming synonymous with big, loud action movies. And that name was Michael Bay. How times change! However, don't be put off by seeing the man responsible for Megan Fox and Transformers' name in the credits. 'Bad Boys' is actually quite a fun film.It's nothing new, i.e. two bickering cops do their best to protect a material witness while fending off various attempts on everyone's lives courtesy of 'the mob.' But it's fun and its two stars (Martin Lawrence and Will Smith – believe it or not, back then Martin Lawrence was the 'star' and Will Smith just the supporting cast member. Again, how times change!) play off each other nicely. They shoot, they playfully berate each other, while watching each other's backs at all times. There are car chases and shoot-outs, plus a load of wise-cracks to keep you entertained.I would almost say this is the perfect loud, dumb action movie. However, the only downside (in my opinion) is the film's length. It doesn't really need to be nearly two hours. The 'extra' plot lines revolve around the witness to the murder believing that Martin Lawrence's character is really Will Smith and vice versa. A lot goes into this plot line and I couldn't see the need for any of it (it almost degenerates into 'farce' at some stages). I'd rather the writers had played the film – a little – straighter and had more serious stuff with just the odd one-liner to keep things a little happy.But that's a minor gripe. The film is still fun and should be enjoyed with a big (bad) bag of popcorn.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Bad Boys

Representing the very best of the guilty-pleasure genre, the Michael Bay vehicle (before he went full Bayhem) is a genuinely funny, consistently entertaining, even if somewhat dated buddy-cop thriller. Something that cinema seems to be missing in 2019, but Will Smith & Martin Lawrence present an incredible combo that has now lasted 25 years, and counting. You can make the case that this film is a 90's classic.8.0/10",Bad Boys
32,Cineanalyst,"""Those Aren't Ideas; They're Special Effects""",3,20 July 2020,"For whatever misguided reason, I decided to catch up on the ""Bad Boys"" series. I don't remember if I ever saw the first two before, which isn't surprising because the narrative in this first installment is forgettably formulaic and the actors are constantly playing intense, shouting their lines, to the point that nothing they do or say becomes memorable. It doesn't help, either, that their lines are extremely stupid. Exclaiming, ""You forgot your boarding pass,"" and other witless rejoinders before killing baddies--really? I like my share of mindless action junk, but this is too much. Not that such is surprising, however, given that two of the most notorious filmmakers of excess, Jerry Buckheimer and Michael Bay, in his directorial debut, were behind the camera.So, of course, there's choppy cutting, with transition effects, such as the suggestion of zooms and whip pans for cuts on action, to make the editing appear even rapider. And if the tempo seems to be lagging or nothing very interesting is happening, which is often, the score is cranked up. Plus, explosions--lots of explosions. Chases, too. All of this is balanced by the slow-motion shots thrown in throughout--often seemingly with no motivation. Miami is bathed in yellow, which looks garish, especially in Bay's many close-ups of screaming actors shining in sweat from the harsh lighting on their faces. For every joke that is almost amusing for its ridiculous randomness (the police captain shooting basketballs poorly, e.g.), there's another scene, such as Martin Lawrence's character explaining, in so many words, how he's too homophobic to be gay, to remind me why I hate these guys' movies. ""Bad Boys"" is obnoxious.*Review title taken from a reply in a ""South Park"" episode parodying Michael Bay.",Bad Boys

I saw this film on sale and I told myself to buy it and I'm happy I did.Smith and Lawrence play two foul-mouthed cops with a mission to recover stolen narcotics and to deal with one sexy witness.Speaking of sexy, that's the way to describe Tea Leoni in this film. She would keep any guy glued to the screen. Smith is good as usual. This has to be Lawrence's best film.This movie has a great mixture of comedy and action.

35,CuriosityKilledShawn,The movie that put Michael Bay on the map...to notoriety,6,17 March 2001,"Say what you want about Michael Bay, all criticisms are valid, but I do think that he is a skilled and talented director with a vision, it just so happens to be a poor vision that hasn't changed in 25 years. Bad Boys was his debut feature after honing his skills on music videos, and all this time later he has not matured as a filmmaker, which is kinda sad. He still makes mindless popcorn trash with the stolen aesthetic of Ridley Scott and Tony Scott.Bad Boys took ten years to get to the screen, starting out as an 80s buddy comedy called Bulletproof Hearts that was to star Jon Lovitz and Dana Carvey. It was rewritten, chewn-up and thrown out by the studios before it ended up with Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, who, at the time, did not have a hit since Days of Thunder (which was mauled by critics). They rebranded the script Bad Boys and a phenomenon was born.Does the movie deserve it's popularity? Not really.The plot, for what it's worth, concerns screaming foreign crime boss Fuchet (Tchecky Kayro in an intimidating and effective performance) who slays an idiot member of his drug-dealing gang. Beautiful Julie Mott (Tea Leoni) witnesses the slaying and is marked for death . She calls the cops but for painfully contrived reasons will only talk to Mike Lowrey (the uber-obnoxious Will Smith). Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) is the only person there who can take the call and assumes the role of Mike in order to take Julie into 'in-home' protective custody. Why he doesn't just reveal to her right away that he told a little white lie only to get her out of harms way...I dunno. Perhaps it is because it's the only plot element that the legion of writers could abuse to inject the slightest amount of comedy and drag out an 85-minute premise to 2 hours. There are so many lulls in the action that the movie frequently threatens to keel over and die. Bay has a habit of making his movies overly long but even with his debut he couldn't recognise the dead weight that drags everything down.The action scenes, when they do happen, are thrilling, and it's to Michael Bay's credit that he's managed to pull this off. Without him the movie would be long forgotten though he could have reigned in on Will Smith's complete inability to ad-lib and cut out the irritating screaming matches between the various cast members. No one has clever dialogue here, it's all anger and rage, and it's horrible.Strangely, Martin Lawrence comes off the better actor of the two and is almost endearing.Mark Mancina's fun score keeps the slow pace just about bearable and keeps the transitions between scenes ticking over nicely. The 90s soundtrack is a little dated and the entire plot is an 80s relic to the point where it's hard to ignore how unoriginal it is and appreciate it for its true merits, few as they might be.Bay Boys was shot in standard 1.85:1 widescreen by Howard Atherton, famous for his work on Fatal Attraction and Black Rain (where he was usurped, somewhat unfairly, by Jan De Bont) and it looks gorgeous in 4K HDR. The compositions, set designs, and filtering techniques all have a Ridley Scott flavor to them which sets it apart from its wretched sequel. For all it's flaws, Bad Boys sure does have amazing cinematography which I believe helped give Michael Bay the edge he was looking for among the crop of hopeful action directors who were emerging at the time.",Bad Boys

37,The-Sarkologist,One pretty slick film,8,14 October 2011,"This is a Jeremy Buckanheimer/Don Simpson production, the two who were behind two of the Beverly Hills Cops movies. Now I tend to ignore producers because they tend not to be involved in the actual creative side of the movie, but there seems to be similarities between this movie and Beverly Hills Cops. In a way, Bad Boys is like Beverly Hills Cop with two Eddie Murphies which quite successfully bounce off of each other. As an action movie it is not much but as a movie that focuses on Martin Lawerance and Will Smith it works quite well. Lawrence and Smith add a lot of life into what would be a quite boring movie. When I first saw this movie it was years ago and I was disappointed. I was expecting an action extravaganza and didn't get it. Now I watched it after a couple of friends spent an entire night quoting Bad Boys and Men in Black rips in a café, and now I have come it appreciate the movie. Bad Boys is not focused on the action but more on the characters of Smith and Lawrence. What makes the movie interesting is that Burnett (Martin Lawrence) must pose as Mike Lowry (Will Smith) to keep a material witness for a case. Mike Lowrey is a smooth bachelor while Burnett is a married man. Unfortunately Burnett must pretend to be Mike Lowry, who is well known for his smoothness, yet remain faithful to his wife while he looks after a rather attractive woman. It is interesting though that I thought Will Smith played Burnett but rather he plays Lowery. Now that I know I reckon Lawrence was far more entertaining than Smith. Lowery was a very straight person while Burnett was the one that constantly shouted his mouth off. It is interesting that Smith takes on the role of the smart talking cop in Men in Black. This movie's cool. It appeals to the sense of just watching characters simply bounce off of each other and are so comfortable with each other that they constantly pay each other out. That is probably why so many people watched this movie. It also seemed to put Will Smith into a niche. I can't end this without commenting on the cinematography. It was absolutely beautiful. It caught me when I first saw it and it caught me again. The cinematographers used a very effective dusty light to create a more dirty and run down view of Miami. It wasn't like that all the way through, but it turned away from the glitz that Miami is known for. Other scenes where just awesome, like the boat that moved across the screen behind the car. I also thought some of the camera shots with very well done, such as moving it over the characters. It can be done but the equipment must have been purposely built. Some of the editing seemed to have been cut a little too quick, but beyond that I think the film makers have been severely under praised.",Bad Boys

His first three movies Bad Boys, Armageddon and The Rock are all superb action movies of the highest calibre. Truthfully Bad Boys still holds up very well twenty two years later. OK, it borrows or recycles a lot from other movies, it's style over substance and some of the dialogue is more than a little hokey and lame, but that is only a minor problem when the movie is this much fun. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence (improvising a lot of scenes) are a lot of fun, and have great on screen chemistry. Tea Leoni is gorgeous, but her delivery at times is awful, though I'm not sure if it was the fault of the awful dialogue or the actress, ""No, it's another murder case, you twerp!!"" Stands out, as does what a noisy eater Martin Lawrence is!! I've said a few times, how much I hate noisy eaters!! Theresa Randle is fun and Joe Pantolianao steals all his scenes as Captain Howard.

I admit, the humor does work for 'Bad Boys', but I did find the humor a bit too much for my taste. Then again, this is an action comedy, I suppose...At least some of the humor was funny. Too much foul language, too. Ok, but let's forget about the humor and the bad mouths for a while. Will Smith stars as detective Mike Lowrey - a rich guy thanks to a generous inheritance from his parents. He nevertheless just wants to be a cop, and he's good at it. Martin Lawrence stars as his partner (erm, colleague) and best friend, Marcus. The chemistry between the two were enjoyable.When a gang of robbers steal heroin worth $100 million, Mike and Marcus are assigned to crack the case. The situation gets out of control when a girl, Max (Karen Alexander) who is also Mike's friend - is killed by the gang, leaving a witness, Julie (well played by Tea Leoni).When Mike is not available to take Julie's call, Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano) insists Marcus pretends to be Mike in order to speak to her - since she will only speak to Mike. Marcus and Mike then switch identities when they take her in protective custody. I found this identity switch preposterous, to say the least, and was more than just a bit distracting. That should have been an entirely different comedy altogether.At least the film redeems itself during the final act with impressive action sequences as it picks up the pace again. Will Smith is in perfect shape, and they use this to the film's advantage. The camera work is very good and the film boasts a stunning climax. If I can erase the stupid identity switch from my mind, 'Bad Boys' is an entertaining action thriller.",Bad Boys

The film has been somewhat panned by critics but adored by fans alike. As a film, it does bring a certain entertainment lead by Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as their chemistry and slick talking dialogue is the main reason for their constant back and forth. The plot is somewhat thin but there is enough action, explosions and gun shootouts for action fans to enjoy. Although predictable completely, some parts of the film seem off and forced. Such as, the need for Martin Lawrence's character Marcus Burnett in pretending to be Will Smith's character Mike Lowrey to impress Tea Leoni, since she specifically asked for Mike.

The music, the slow motion, the excessive amount of explosions and the reference to a retired Michael Jordan in 1995 give that away easily. Good films transcend time and a majority of the people that watch ""Bad Boys"" in the future will not be too impressed with what they see.The movie is in the action genre, but the plot seems focused around the lives of Mike and Marcus (Smith and Lawrence), cop partners with different lives who constantly argue with each other. Basically, what you get is Smith and Lawrence arguing or doing something stupid, action scene, Smith and Lawrence arguing or doing something stupid again, another action scene. It gets redundant and old very fast, especially because the plot is simple (someone stole heroin from the police) and the 'bad boys' or the antagonists are so distant from the film that they seem stupid.Michael Bay deserves credit for establishing himself as the best director when it comes to blowing stuff up. He will forever have that mark on Hollywood and this is where it started, but his interesting action sequences are empty and aimless thanks to a bad cop movie plot.The only thing keeping the entertainment value of ""Bad Boys"" up is the duo of Smith and Lawrence. While they argue way too much, there are some funny scenes and other scenes in which they come across as very bad ass. Without them, the film would basically be like someone trying to turn Walt Disney World's Indiana Jones stunt spectacular into a movie: there would be nothing interesting worth following and just stuff blowing up to keep people intrigued.",Bad Boys

47,Anonymous_Maxine,One of Jerry Bruckheimer's better films.,8,30 April 2001,"Bad Boys is another one of the typical highly glossed action films from producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay, but it works much better than many of the other mediocre films produced by Bruckheimer (such as Armageddon, Gone In 60 Seconds,  Coyote Ugly).Martin Lawrence and Will Smith work very well as this movie's odd couple, in a police partnership that goes further than police partnerships might be expected to. Not only are they partners, they are also best friends, despite tremendous differences in personality (which was the same for Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh).While the movie may get a little excessive at some points, the entertainment value is high, due mostly to the quality performances delivered by Smith and Lawrence, as well as Tea Leoni. It seems that a huge amount of narcotics, Smith's and Lawrence's career bust, has been stolen, and they are assigned to investigate the disappearance. What follows is a very well thought out and interesting crime film that rivals many of the better James Bond films, even if it borrowed heavily from the traditional Bond formula.
Bad Boys is clearly exaggerated in many ways, it is unmistakably a Hollywood film, but it does not fail to entertain beyond the mindless cinema that is common from Bruckheimer as well as Martin Lawrence (remember that idiot film, Big Momma's House?). This is not necessarily destined to be a classic action film (that distinction is reserved for nearly flawless films like The Fugitive), but Bad Boys is definitely worth the time to watch.

There's a car chase, there's an overabundance of black jokes, there's a stressed chief who likes to yell at his subordinates, there's a misunderstanding between lovers, there's fanservice, there's... You know, I could go on like this for quite some time.But, the movie was bearable, as stated. Because while the plot was old and worn-out, it wasn't terrible either. There were some really dumb jokes, but there were some good ones as well. And, as stated, the two main characters were played by talented actors, and to the movie's credit, they are the main focus, as they should be. I can't say that I regret seeing this film. It has its reputation and it is one of those movies that everyone knows about. Has it earned that reputation? Yes and no. It has its upsides, but it has its downsides as well. All in all, a mixed experience.",Bad Boys

51,FiendishDramaturgy,Fast-paced action comedy entertainment,8,16 September 2003,"As two hard-line cops who work hard at their job, and do their best along the way. When a ""career bust"" in heroin disappears from the city police's locked evidence cage, it's up to our two heroes to find out where it went and why.In the classic style of ""Beverly Hills Cop,"" ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Tango and Cash""-meet-the-Wayan Brothers style, this movie entertains you at least as good as the aforementioned comparisons Lawrence and Smith are highly volatile in this action/comedy, pulling off gritty one-liners while kicking major butt. There is the predictable presence of car-crashes, explosions and obligatory chase scenes, but the performances of Smith and Lawrence totally redeem the predictability of the movie.Their characters are well developed and are convincingly portrayed with the greatest of talent. The one-liners take an appropriate break when the drama is high, and Smith shows a very gifted side to his talent as a thespian in the portrayal of his character. I must also say the same thing about Lawrence. I never thought I would like Martin Lawrence as a dramatic actor, but his abilities really shine in this film. He is quite believable, as is Smith. Very talented actors. I'll never think of either of them as strictly comedic actors again. I was actually impressed with them both. I liked them both better in these more serious parts than in the comedies they've each done. Also, I highly recommend the ""Special Edition"" version of this movie on DVD. There are the usual stunning music videos at the end of this version (featuring Martin Lawrence and Will Smith, of course) and, while I find them completely self-serving and to be the height of arrogance, they are also entertaining.I would also like to add that the cinematography of the scenery between scenes is breath-taking. Michael Bay must have spent days scouting the scenery that was filmed in this movie. He captured some of the most beautiful areas of Miami. Finely and expertly done.Afterward: Tea Leone was extremely believable in this movie. Much better than her stiff and sometimes halting performance in ""Jurassic Park 3."" MUCH better.This is an excellent movie and I can't wait for Bad Boys 2 to come out on DVD!! This was great fun with beautiful cinematography and a solid story-line.It gets an 8.3/10 from...the Fiend :.",Bad Boys

But then it manages to peck, and mock, and spoof Miami Vice in pretty subtle ways through the film and it manages to do it without being a blatant Scary Movie style stupid spoof. It does it in a way that it can get it's digs in and still stand on it's own as a film, so as far as I'm concerned that makes it pretty north of brilliant.",Bad Boys
53,Polaris_DiB,Romp,7,13 February 2006,"Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer, two household names that are very successful Hollywood filmmakers often renowned for releasing that ""same old clichéd garbage"" and ""those movies with the 'splosions,"" bring us Martin Lawrence and Will Smith, box office magnets themselves, in what can only be described as a vastly entertaining romp through Miami as two cops try to reclaim their career-long stash of stolen heroin. It also involves Tea Leoni in very attractive outfits.With films like these, it's a race to see the newest and most intriguing way of getting our heroes into those situations we know and love (and love to hate): car chases, gun-fights, explosive climaxes, and evil meanies with foreign accents and the inability to shoot anything that's not a vase, a column, a window, and maybe the occasional wall.However, to mix it up a bit, we get a nice little subplot about mistaken identity, as Martin Lawrence's character tries to mimic Will Smith's character, and vice-versa. Such provides just enough humor and acting to leave the whole thing worth it, and what do ya know but you can't help but feel for these bumbling heroes as they run along getting into mishap after mishap before saving the day by blowing up everything in site (which includes some of their friends which the film failed to acknowledge at the end, but whatever).So for the visual bonanza and exciting demise of warm, sunny Florida, look no further: these are the bad boys.--PolarisDiB",Bad Boys
54,kevin_robbins,T his is an action junky's dream and an absolute classic,9,9 November 2021,"Bad Boys (1995) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows two childhood friends, Marcus and Mike, who grew up to become detectives together in Miami. When a friend of Mike's gets killed and her best friend needs protection, they need to switch identities to protect the whiteness and solve the case. This movie is directed by Michael Bay (The Rock) and stars Will Smith (Men in Black), Martin Lawrence (Martin), Theresa Randle (Spawn), Joe Pantoliano (Memento) and Téa Leoni (Jurassic Park III). The storyline for this is pretty fun for the action genre. The cast is outstanding top to bottom. Lawrence's awkward moments are both painful and hilarious. The dynamics and chemistry between Smith and Lawrence are excellent and the dialogue is well written and executed. There's some all time classic lines in this but ""mother bitches"" always makes me laugh out loud. This film has some cool slow motion sequences, both for drama and great action enhancements. The action scenes overall are excellent, especially the ending. Overall this is an action junky's dream and an absolute classic. I'd score this a solid 9-9.5/10.",Bad Boys
55,dee.reid,"""Bad Boys"" - Same old stuff, but still ""badder"" than the rest",8,1 April 2005,"I don't know who encouraged the creative teaming of comedian Martin Lawrence and rapper-turned-actor Will Smith in this big, loud, explosive action-comedy from 1995, but it's certainly an inspired team-up.""Bad Boys"" plays a lot like a collision between every buddy-cop movie we've ever seen, and since many of those ideas were exhausted in what seemed like eons ago, almost nothing here seems fresh. But what keeps the movie afloat is the dynamic interaction between stars Lawrence and Smith.This film, which in 1995 was the latest collaboration between producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, the team that was responsible for heavy-hitting Hollywood action vehicles such as ""Top Gun"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop,"" brought audiences another big blockbuster to rake in the cash.""Bad Boys,"" directed by Michael Bay, starred Lawrence and Smith as Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery, a pair of Miami narcotics cops whose careers had been made by a huge heroin bust from a few years earlier. As the film opens, a crack team of vicious thieves/drug dealers led by Fouchet (Tcheky Karyo) breaks into the Miami P.D. headquarters and steals their career-making bust.As a result of this f**k-up, Internal Affairs, specifically a bloodthirsty agent named Sinclair (Marg Helgenberger), comes down hard on the cops' Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano), who's afraid that this theft will become a public relations nightmare. To further complicate matters, Julie Mott (Tea Leoni), a witness to the murder of a close friend of Lowery's that was committed by Fouchet and his thugs, is forced to go into protective custody and results in having the two detectives to have to switch identities until the stolen heroin can be recovered.Burnett and Lowery then go to work to track down the bad guys, the dope, and protect Julie - and they only 72 hours to do it in. And then get ready for the explosions and the action that ""Bad Boys"" has to serve up to you.The movie works largely as a result of the comradeship between Lawrence and Smith, who both according to the IMDb, ad-libbed a fair number of their scenes together because reportedly Michael Bay didn't like some of the dialogue in the screenplay. The acting from these two is brilliant, and so is the acting from many of the supporting players too.The action sequences, as you would expect from the former music video director Bay, who's also making his big screen directorial debut here, is of the flash-and-cut-type, giving way to many exciting scenes and slow motion shots of the actors in threatening poses.Given that this is Bay's feature directorial debut, it is certainly a fair way for him to enter into the world of action directing. Too bad some of his more recent work doesn't quite live up to the standards he may have defined himself with here. The film's sequel, released in 2003, which is bigger, badder, and louder, really upped the action and dynamism between the two returning leads.""Bad Boys"" is an excellent action movie that's certainly entertaining and fun to watch again and again.8/10",Bad Boys
56,alindsay-al,A Good fun buddy cop film,7,17 January 2020,"In preparation for Bad Boys For Life, I have decided to rewatch both Bad Boys and Bad Boys 2. So to start with the first Bad Boys film and this is my opinion on this film. The premise of the film sees two cops have to protect a witness and track down a shipment of drugs they had previously tracked down.
Main Character
This film has two leads in this film and they are both great, Martin Lawrence & Will Smith plays the leads in the film and they have brilliant chemistry together. They really carry this film to make it better then it really has any right to be for a generic action film, they are both hilarious and you can tell Smith was poised to go onto huge things in the industry.
Supporting Characters
Joe Pantoliano plays the police captain in this film and I thought he was actually really good in the film, he fit his role really well and I thought he had a fun dynamic with Smith & Lawrence. Tea Leoni plays the witness in the film and she does a good job in the film, she is an interesting character in the film and she wasn't just a one dimensional female character and fit the team very well. But an important part of a film like this is having an interesting and cool villain and this film doesn't have that. The villain is really boring and he has no clear motivation in the film to make him a credible or interesting threat for the good guys.
Story
The film has a good dynamic between the two leads and it is very entertaining watching them go on this investigation. But this film is very generic and fitting of the time, the side plots are dropped pretty quickly and it is very obvious where the film is going and how it is going to end.
Script
The script is really funny, I was laughing quite a bit in this film as Smith and Lawrence spurt out really entertaining one liners and rise above what could have been seen as a cheesy script. But the drama when attempted just didn't quite hit for me and I didn't care about the drama that was going on in these guys lives I just wanted to watch them be entertaining and doing police work.
Style
The action scenes are very entertaining and seeing the gunfights makes this film feel maybe a bit more modern then it actually is. There are some old techniques used such as slow mo but it just fits for this film and I can't deny that I was engrossed when the action scenes were happening.Overall
Overall this is a very entertaining action film that sparked the buddy cop film really, it has been imitated plenty of times but this is a fun film that might be worth a watch if you enjoy fun action films.",Bad Boys

59,jimbo-53-186511,What chu gonna do?,7,25 March 2020,"When a huge haul of heroin (worth $100 million dollars) is stolen from a police station lifelong friends and partners Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) are assigned to recover the goods (as it was they that were responsible for bringing the haul in). However, they soon find themselves having to deal with a murder case as well as the heroin, but a key witness informs Lowrey and Burnett that those that stole the heroin are also responsible for the murder...It's been over 20 years since I watched this film and oddly enough before I started watching Bad Boys this evening the only part I remembered was Martin Lawrence saying 'Sit your lanky ass down' to Fletcher (no idea why it just stuck in my head for some reason). That aside, I'm glad to report (now that I'm well into my 30's that Bad Boys is still just as enjoyable all these years later)Most of the success is down to Martin Lawrence and Will Smith whose chemistry is second to none (which is an essential ingredient in any cop film). Whilst the trading insults and trash-talking between Smith and Lawrence would have probably been enough to keep things ticking over I think a funny aspect to the narrative was seeing them effectively 'swapping identities.' It never comes off that convincingly (deliberately I assume) for comedic effect, but it nevertheless provides a lot of laughs.As with a lot of these type of films the story is perhaps where the film is at its weakest; the investigative side of the film is not all that interesting and the villains are paper-thin, but this is compensated by Bay directing the film in a snappy manner and allowing the film to move so fast that it doesn't matter (Smith and Lawrence's good cop/bad cop shtick is another asset that Bay exploits to maximum effect).Aside from a generic story, a few other weaknesses lay with how certain things unfold on screen; one such example is Will Smith disappearing from the film for what felt like about half an hour (could have been more/could have ben less). To my knowledge he disappeared without reason and Lowrey never explains his absence so I was kind of with Burnett thinking ""Where yo been?"" It's noticeable because I felt Lawrence needed Smith to make this work so when Smith's not around the film does suffer slightly... I also wasn't entirely taken with Tea Leoni's character who seemed to just get in the way (despite her being integral to the plot).In fairness though, the film really comes in to its own in the last 30 minutes and it's here where you can imagine Michael Bay started to salivate when he was saying to himself 'Come on here it is the big action finale watch what I can do' and in his defence this is his piece de resistance the finale is overblown and exciting with plenty of explosions, slow-mo shots and things crashing and it's all unashamedly good.Bad Boys is far from perfect and if you called it 'loud and superficial' I wouldn't argue, but what with the Corona Virus putting 20% of the world on lockdown at present this is just the kind of escapist nonsense that we need. It's a lot of fun and the amount of time Bay spends winking at the audience you get the feeling that he knows this.",Bad Boys

After this one, I think Michael Bay has been cemented in my mind as one of the worst directors of all time. As you can tell, I'm not one of his fans. This time, he has taken a couple of pretty appealing movie stars and turned them into worthless action heros with the occasional one-liner thrown in (Aka -Travolta & Cage w/ Face-Off). This time he's done it with Will Smith & Martin Lawrence. He has the unique ability of spending lots of money blowing things up and devoiding the audience of all caring for it's characters. This movie is about a bickering cop due who become involved in a major drug deal and protecting a witness, played by Tea Leoni. She provides some of the only nice moments in the movie with some witty lines despite her weak character. Smith & Martin bicker throughout the whole movie, their cop boss yell at them a few times, things blow up, there are a few car chases, people get killed and the good guys end up winners in the end. That's about it for this mindless action-comedy movie from one of the biggest money wasting directors of our time, who has very little good stuff to show for it.

69,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Nice Popcorn Entertainment,7,18 July 2015,"It's definitely something to see when watching a film that kick-started a lot of Hollywood's contemporary stars. Although Will Smith was already a popular sensation with his hit TV series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990-1996), this would be Smith's first entry into the action genre of films, thus having to never turn back after that. Martin Lawrence was pretty much in the same seat except that he didn't have as much notoriety as Smith. However, this film would too have Lawrence jump into the action film typecast role. Then there's the biggest realization of all. Other than directing a number of music videos, this would end up being the first film helmed by action director Michael Bay. It's interesting that there wasn't even a transition for this man. Straight from music to action blockbusters. Not even a TV movie before this, he must have had some connections.The plot follows a drug heist headed by mastermind Fouchet (Tchéky Karyo) where two cops who grew up together through childhood, Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) only have a couple days to figure out where the deal to sell the drugs is going down. The only way these two can get the information is by protecting eyewitness Julie Mott (Téa Leoni), who happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. For three writers consisting of Michael Barrie, Jim Mulholland (who both wrote for comedy sketch shows for Dave Letterman) and Doug Richardson (Die Hard 2 (1990)), the script actually has nothing that stands out as something without good quality. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have energetic chemistry and work off each other well. Both also properly emote at the right times and give the right amount of clues to the audience on how each one grew up compared to each other. Will Smith is the smooth, calm and collected one. Even when he's mad, he's still calm. Martin Lawrence plays the opposite; a hyper, loud and rambunctious married man.Plus, there's a slew of other casting choices that make each scene worthwhile. Theresa Randle (a popular actress during this decade) plays Marcus' wife named Theresa (oddly enough). Joe Pantoliano plays Mike and Marcus' captain on the force that definitely acts like one. And then there's Nestor Serrano and Julio Oscar Mechoso who play another pair of cops who work along side Mike and Marcus. The only actor who isn't interesting in their role is Tchéky Karyo as Fouchet. Aside from trying to get his plan into action without being caught and speaking with his foreign accent, there's not much to say about his performance. Sure, Karyo is an unfeeling man with no conscious but much of his scenes don't involve him interacting directly with the main leads for the majority of the time. It just feels like there's a disconnect. Other than that, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have some very comical exchanges. Plus, with the film having an R rating, they both can really unleash their thoughts uncensored.Téa Leoni as Julie also adds some inventive scenes that aren't usually exploited in the buddy cop genre films. Although this film is in that vein, it doesn't feel so much like that here. Does the Julie character act with courage - yeah but does she do it because it's needed - no. It's always good to have a headstrong female character but here, Julie is just there to get Marcus and Mike hot headed. Then there's the action and special effects to this film. From what it looks like, this movie looked like it used no CGI, just practical effects. The action is also abundant as well with plenty of fistfights, shootouts and an occasional explosions. Which again, are all real looking. It's funny to see a movie directed by Michael Bay and see a movie done completely with practical effects and infrequent explosions. It just doesn't feel like the same guy everyone knows of today.However, the cinematography shot by Howard Atherton (best known for Fatal Attraction (1987)) isn't anything to cheer about. There are some camera shots that capture the Miami setting, but much of it is closed quarters. Whether it be in someone's home or warehouse, the angles from inside just don't suffice. There are a number of slow-motion shots (most likely due to Bay's request) that look good but again don't always stand out. Finally the music was an enjoyable listening experience. Composing the film score was Mark Mancina who had his first successful music release with Speed (1994) and then Fair Game (1995). Here, Mancina thankfully has a main theme for the franchise using guitar and what sounds like islander type drums. Considering the setting and who is starring in the film, it sounds appropriate. The action cues, which sound familiar to that of Trevor Rabin (but not entirely synthetic), are also lively enough to match the sequences that are displayed on screen. It's at those points; more percussion is used along with strings and horns. It is certainly effective. It's a fun watch.The plot's main villain isn't well defined and the cinematography is rather plain looking but the rest is wholesomely entertaining.

THe title of the movie is based on a popular song used for the classic tv show COPS, and both movies including this one have a killer soundtrack. Will Smith got his big break with this movie before getting into an even bigger movie with ID4 (soon to be dwarfed by others including Alladin).

71,Rob_Taylor,It was like deja vu.....only not.,5,11 October 2003,"Yep, with the upcoming Bad Boys 2 I felt I had to watch the original first, so I could comment on whether No 2 was better or worse than the original. But the really freaky thing was, as I watched Bad Boys, I became more and more convinced that I had seen it before. Yet I couldn't remember a damn thing about it. It was only right at the end, with the airfield climax, that I was certain I had seen it already.And that really sums up Bad Boys.... a movie that you will watch, then instantly forget....or blot from your memory vigorously.Its just plain formulaic cop-buddy movie-no brainer action movie stuff. You know whats going to happen within minutes of the films opening scenes.
In fact, what this movie put me in mind of was a Starsky and Hutch episode. Think about it...You have the yelling police chief in the form of Joe Pantoliano. He's no Capt. Dobie, but he gives it a shot.You have the two buddy cops who love each other dearly, but are always bickering.You have the constant arguments about who drives the best, the ""don't mess up my car"" dialogues etc.The only thing missing is Huggy Bear.In short, this movie is dull and predictable. The action scenes are looking very dated now and fail to impress.About the best thing I can say about this film is that it isn't I Spy, which was even duller.I'm hoping BB2 will be better, but I'm not holding my breath.",Bad Boys
72,PredragReviews,Miami Vice for the Nineties... not at all!,7,14 June 2016,"Hilariously enjoyable as any black comedy and full of fast paced action, ""Bad Boys,"" as a 'slick flick,' stars Martin Lawrence as Marcus Burnett and Will Smith as Mike Lowrey playing two cops who fall on to the trail of millions of dollars of Heroin stolen by a criminal mastermind named Fouchet (Tcheky Karyo) and try to recover it as well as rescue Julie Mott (Tea Leoni) who is also involved. Personal matters appear to Marcus Burnett who is obsessed with getting ""quality time"" with his wife Theresa (Theresa Randle) and almost loses his marriage when he is forced to switch names and use Mike Lowrey in front of Julie. The comedy works unmistakeably well, however, the only mistakes I find in here are the heavy profanity and the violence used. But I keep saying this to myself, how can you pardon the profanity if it works well with the script? Really many actors would probably have the problem with making the jump from TV to film, especially when their primary job had been comedy, with very little drama and no action, but Will Smith and Martin Lawrence succeed brilliantly. The comedic timing between these two actors is outstanding, and both pull off the dramatic scenes very convincingly, and the action scenes are well played and laid out thanks to the adrenaline charged directing of Michael Bay and the athletic prowess of the actors. Jerry Bruckheimer's skill for picking projects and finding the right people to make them come together seems to never fail, and ""Bad Boys"" is no exception.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Bad Boys
73,eric262003,Another Line of Buddy-Cop Rip-Offs,6,7 March 2016,"In the 1980's and 1990's there have been numerous buddy-cop films that were in the long run very entertaining. Stuff like ""48 Hours"", Lethal Weapon"", ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and more. Sure they're filled with excitement and intrigue leaving you fulfilled, but over the years, the tiresome formula has also spawned several rip-offs that were quite cheap. In 1995 ""Bad Boys"" was added to this list of cheap knock-offs with the direction that looks too MTV-like and has recycled plots from those action comedies that I have aforementioned. This movie is flooded with action sequences and the real reason behind that is to hide the fact that the storyline lacks any credibility behind it. The director (Michael Bay) thought the audience are only going to watch this movie to see explosions, bullets, and lots of dead bodies and not care in the least for logic and cohesiveness in the story. The inactive moments serve no purpose as were are left wondering if any of these pieces fit. Sure the pacing is very fast but at times it tends to just spin out of control. I mean if you lose control with the action scenes, you lose the story of the script and ""Bad Boys"" falls victim in that area. When it came time for brainstorming, the writers (Michael Barrie, Jim Mulholland and Doug Richardson) had the simplistic idea (drug heist in Miami located in a police safe) and just have a way to wrap things up (like we know what will happen to the villains). Then we have like always the odd couple pairing of Marcus Bennett (Martin Lawrence) and Michael Lowery (Will Smith) who in spite of their hostility towards one another have mutual respect behind it all and a female witness (Tea Leoni) who's role is quite pivotal even if she messes up here and there at times. Sure there's nothing new to offer here, but it's the only thing about the movie that saves it from being entirely contrived. The poor script has very little thought and it truly brought this movie down quite substantially. In one very nonsensical scene Marcus and Michael are forced to swap identities when they are with the murder witness Julie Mott (Leoni). The comical elements serve no real purpose and it comes to the point of even caring about it at all. In fact sitcoms like ""Three's Company"" has managed to pull it off much better. I'll say that Lawrence and Smith are a likable duo. There's a great chemistry between the two of them goes beyond the humour factor. It's just that even their dialogue is just rehashed from other movies that executed them far better here. The supporting players are also victims to the formulaic tripe like the witty sidekick, the loyal wife (Theresa Randle), the corrupt criminal mastermind (Tcheky Karyo) and the always angry superior captain (Joe Pantoliano). If there was a positive thing about this movie was it was energetic and had a lot of style. The cinematography by Howard Atherton was very vibrant in colour and detail. The score by Mark Mancini compliments quite nice in terms of the chase scenes and the fights. But even the technical traits couldn't really save this film very much which in the end leaves ""Bad Boys"" an average film at most with lots of details that could've been handled with more care.",Bad Boys
74,philip_vanderveken,"99% of all action movies is pure rubbish, but there is 1% that's not that bad at all.",7,18 October 2004,"I don't like action movies, 99% of them is pure rubbish. All you get in this kind of movies is an army of bad guys being shot with more bullets than were used in World War I and II together, all fired by our beloved hero. He comes out of the fight without a scratch of course and quickly spits out some bad one-liners when standing over all those dead bodies (think of all the movies with Seagal, Schwarzenegger, Stallone...) They make me sick!If you have seen one, you've seen them all. So why did I watch Bad Boys then? Well, as I said, 99% is pure rubbish, there is still 1% left and I consider Bad Boys to be one of this percent. OK, the story isn't very original, but the acting is OK and I had a good laugh from time to time thanks to Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. Don't expect an intellectual movie when renting or buying Bad Boys. Just go for the action scenes spiced up with a nice dose of humor, which certainly make it worth a watch. When watching a movie I look for some quality time and a good and original story has a lot to do with that of course, but having a good laugh from time to time doesn't hurt either... That's why I reward it with a 7/10. I liked it.",Bad Boys

The banter back and forth between Smith and Lawrence is priceless not only at the beginning but throughout the whole film. Michael Bay loves to saturate his action films with comedy and having real comedians deliver the punchlines actually works, however, compared to forcing others to try it out like in Transformers or Armageddon. The action is great in this one as well as the script. Entertaining film all around.",Bad Boys
79,rivertam26,Fantastic action setpieces,9,15 January 2020,This movies action scenes are ridiculous and utterly fantastic. The way in which Michael Bay artfully executes the action sequences are breathtaking and amazingly edge of your seat. The film is a reminder of why Wil Smith became such a superstar and his chemistry with Martin Lawrence is spot on and they are just hilarious. The pair of officers come upon a drug cartel and end up protecting a feisty witness played by a slightly annoying but kinda bad ass Tea Leoni. It's strange as the film almost comes across as a parody because it revels in such cliches and celebrates them. And honestly that's really part of its charm. Still watching this so many years later it's still so overly entertaining and unique.,Bad Boys
80,Sirus_the_Virus,Smith and Lawrence are great together.,8,13 October 2009,"Michael Bay, now days, might not do that good of movies. I liked the original Transformers. But besides that one, what other good films did Michael Bay direct? Me, I think that Michael Bay's other good film is Bad boys with Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. Did I think that this was as good as Lethal weapon? No, but for a buddy cop movie, I liked it a bit more than Rush hour.I haven't seen this movie in a long time. so I can't exactly give you the story to it. But I sure know it was a good film. Michael Bay can't do good sequels. The only two sequels he directed sucked. Bad Boys II really blew and so did Transformers:Revenge of the fallen. At a time, Michael Bay wasn't so bad. But now days all of his movies aren't very good. Bad boys was a funny, fast paced, and fun movie.

The performance of Will Smith, Martin Lawrence and Téa Leoni are good.",Bad Boys
83,baumer,one of the best action/comedies around,9,26 July 1999,"There is something about black humour that I love.  And I don't mean humour that is gross or dark, I really mean humour by black actors/artists. Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor were funny in their day.  Whoopie Goldberg has me in stitches when she is on stage or in a movie.  Chris Rock is an up and coming comic genius.  And the two guys in this film have me in laughing almost every time I see them on screen.  Martin Lawrence was the best part of Boomerang and in Bad Boys he is hilarious as the married side kick to Will Smith's bachelor playboy.  And of course Will Smith launched his career with this movie.  He is very funny in The Fresh Prince television show and he shows here that his propensity for comedy is excellent.  Together these two are brilliant, one of the best cop buddies since Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh.Bad Boys is a story of two cops that have to protect a witness that saw her best friend murdered.  Her best friend may have had information on some guys that committed huge crimes that involved drugs.  Now it is up to the two heroes to try and crack the case and not get into too much trouble in the process.  There are so many cliched things about this movie, but sometimes cliches are good, if you have likable actors to carry out the script.  As in every buddy cop movie, you have the two partners that are very different but have a mutual respect for each other.  You have the police chief that does nothing but tell them how much they have cost the department, how they could be suspended if they are not careful and how they are the best at what they do but a little too care free.  You have the bad guy with the foreign accent who is charming and debonair but as deadly as a rattlesnake.  Take any good cop/caper movie from Lethal Weapon, Stakeout, Beverly Hills Cop to films like Last Action Hero.  They all have the same themes, but what makes them all good, and that includes this one, is how well they are executed.  A lot of the credit has to go to Smith and Lawrence, but I also think special attention has to be given to Michael Bay.  He was a new comer here and he proved that he has a great eye for action.  The chase scene that starts in Smith's apartment and ends on the street where Lawrence almost dies, is one of the most emotionally charged scenes I've seen in a cop comedy.  It kind of reminded me of Lethal Weapon 2, when at the end I thought Riggs was dead after his battle with the South African bad guy.  That had power, this one is even better than that.Bad Boys is great entertainment and Smith and Michael Bay have become major players in Hollywood now.  This is the start of it all and if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it.  It is funny, action packed and likable. You can't go wrong.  If you like some of the films that were mentioned in the review, then you'll have a hard time not liking this one.  An excellent film.",Bad Boys

When one of Lowery's contacts is murdered by heist mastermind Fouchet (Tchéky Karyo) a witness is left in Julie (Tea Leoni) who will only cooperate with Mike. With Mike unavailable tracking down a lead, Marcus is forced to pretend to be Mike who must deal with Julie's volatile behavior and abrasive attitude while trying to locate the drugs before their sold off.Released in 1995 to mixed reviews but massive box office success, Bad Boys became a massively influential film that not only redefined contemporary action trends (for better or worse) but also springboarded the careers of Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, and director Michael Bay. The trio had become quite well known through their forays in television with Smith and Lawrnece's sitcoms The Fresh Prince of Bel Air and Martin respectively making the duo household names and while Michael Bay was not known by name his dynamic style had gotten him attention with his award winning ""Aaron Burr"" Got Milk? Commercial defined the marketing strategy. Both Smith and Lawrence are effortlessly amusing and charismatic as the leads and Bay does show himself to be adept at staging action with a thrilling opening heist scene and some good set pieces, but unfortunately along with Bay's strengths his weaknesses are just as apparent as he takes a familiar buddy cop framework and unnecessarily bloats it with needless padding and ill timed comedy that diminishes the entertainment value of Bad Boys as it struggles for momentum under the excess.Martin Lawrence's overworked family man Burnett and Will Smith's care free ladies' man bachelor Lowery do well as the mismatched cop duo and are able to generate good comedic friction from strong personalities and improvisation. There's a real charm in place watching the two play back and forth off each other and it's clear while watching Bad Boys these are star making performances. The supporting cast is unfortunately where things get a little more mixed. Tea Leoni is a prominent presence in this movie (almost a third lead really) and while I love Tea Leoni she's playing such a brainless abrasive chaos agent that I was thankful when the movie found reasons to keep her off camera. Everything the character does is irrational, thoughtless, selfish, and annoying and most of this movie's weaknesses can be traced to how poorly this character is written. The rest of the cast are basically just serving as place holders with easily the biggest waste being Tchéky Karyo who was so imposing in Le Femme Nikita as Bob, and here is a barely there antagonist whose biggest distinguishing point is his adherence to his ""timetable"".The plot is a standard cop movie stakes but with the gimmick of Burnett and Lowery built upon pretty flimsy pretext even by the standards of Summer action films. Why Burnett has to continue being Lowery instead of having himself, Lowery, their captain, and Julie sit down and talk about the situation is never even really addressed and it's a plot point that isn't all that special and is just used for some rather base gags that aren't nearly as funny as the film seems to think they are. What humor there is in the movie came more from Smith and Lawrence's improv than any of the comic setpieces given to us in the movie. I will at least say on an action level the film does deliver even if the justification for the action sequences admittedly isn't the strongest out there. There's a sense of weight and presence to the action scenes with Bay's camera work capturing dynamic movement and visceral impact that gives the film a unique look and with the Miami setting and sunset/magic hour photography it is a very nice looking movie.Bad Boys is a serviceable buddy cop action film that suffers from a messy screenplay and an overlong runtime. While the movie isn't all that strong structurally, it does make up for it with strong action and good performances and chemistry from its two leads.",Bad Boys
86,muamba_eats_toast,Underwhelmingly average,6,7 January 2020,Given the cast and things I'd heard about the film in the past I was looking forward to watching this especially ahead of the new film coming out. Overall I was disappointed sure action film wise it was ok but nothing special but laughs wise I cant say I particularly did laugh it just wasn't all that funny which I really was hoping it would be. Maybe it just hasn't aged well but I just couldn't fully buy into it.,Bad Boys
87,hnt_dnl,The last great buddy cop action movie!,10,6 July 2008,"I'm pretty sure that BAD BOYS is the only film of Michael Bay's that I like. Well, technically, while it is the only Bay flick that I like, I can also say that I LOVE it, too! I know that it's supposedly a mindless action buddy cop flick, but it is hugely entertaining and extremely well done. THIS is the type of movie where all of the Bay trademarks work: the driving musical score, the quick jump cuts between and within scenes, funny dialogue (which actually is funny in this film!), strong leads, some seriously sexy females, and characters that sweat all the time (and there's a reason for it here: there in Miami!).Actually, the jump cuts are a big part of why BAD BOYS works. They move the story along nicely and are perfectly placed during the film. Also, Bay does a great job with the camera angles, accentuating the scenes. You don't have time to think or analyze the action, just enjoy. The movie moves at a speedy pace, but not too speedy. And the scenes where the film slows down are all very well done. A really solid action film.The main reason to love BAD BOYS is the ideal pairing of Martin Lawrence and Will Smith as Detectives Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowry, two of Miami's finest undercover narcotics cops. Lawrence is especially impressive as Marcus Burnett with his hilarious stand-up routine being a part of his character, but that's a good thing. He's a laugh riot throughout. But his stand-up act is actually toned down, believe it or not, perfectly to satisfy the constraints of a film; they could easily have screwed up his character, but Lawrence is extremely likable and funny, without being too over-the-top. Smith is very good also as Mike Lowry. He is so comfortable in this role that you could foresee a star in the making based on his performance here. Both actors give really solid performances and do a great job of carrying this film. I find Smith (just slightly) more believable as a cop than Lawrence, but still I go with it b/c the 2 have such great chemistry.The story is moot: some bad guys confiscated drugs from the police station. The cops have to catch the bad guys and get the drugs back. That's the plot! Main reason to enjoy is the humor, fast pace, and chemistry of the leads. Typical cop buddy stuff. Been done before and to death, but it still works in this film. We've seen it in LETHAL WEAPON, 48 HRS, STAKEOUT, etc. In fact, this may be the LAST really good film of its kind.Also of note are sexy Tea Leoni as an important witness the guys need to help catch the bad guys (she and Smith should have gotten together in the end!), Joe Pantoliano as the basic-always-in-a-foul-mood-yelling-cops-boss, Tcheky Karyo as the big bad guy himself, and a host of great supporting characters, most notably Sanchez and Ruiz (the funny sidekicks to the 2 main cops), Mike's doorman Chet (who almost steals the film!), and JoJo (Michael Imperioli of SOPRANOs fame). The film also has working in its favor great cinematography showcasing the sights of Miami, catchy 90s music, and a memorable score, all driving the story along. Bay can hang his hat on this one! It's a keeper!",Bad Boys
88,Stampsfightclub,average crime comedy with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence,6,5 November 2007,"Recently the crime genre has gone through some dramatic changes. Take Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. It was sharp, controversial and dealt with crime issues in such a succinct way it was a marvel, shocking and powerful to watch. And sadly that has been replaced by either pointless comedy and dialogue or ridiculous action sequences.Comedians Will Smith (Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Hitch) and Martin Lawrence (Blue Streak, Martin) try as they may, are unable to capture such brilliance as Scoursese and Robert De Niro did in the crime genre and deliver average performances and jokes in this average crime comedy by Michael Bay. Detectives Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowry discover there has been a drug bust and there only chance of recovering the heroin, is if witness Tea Leoni is willing to cooperate. Whereas the two leads strike up an interesting partnership, it soon wears down and becomes tiresome as the slow moving plot drags along with the detectives trying to find out the mystery to their case. The on screen relationship between Lawrence and Leoni is interesting but far from jaw dropping. There are occasional funny moments but the whole name swapping business is ridiculous and childish.This was Smith's first noticeable film appearance and put him on the map as an established star. He has developed more since this film but this was a good blockbuster for him to get started and he does fairly well as Mike Lowry.Joe Pantoliano (Matrix) plays a good angry Captain Howard but he's hardly in the 2 hour film to establish his character fully. In many ways it's a very obvious plot but the action sequences towards the end are very impressive and are worth watching. The sequel was average and this probably just has the edge with the action sequences.If you're a fan of Will Smith its worth watching but otherwise it isn't.",Bad Boys

It was coming off Netflix, so I thought I'd give it another shot for old times sake. Nostalgia isn't always good. This film really hasn't aged well at all. It's also super forgettable. I know that I won't remember it a week from now again. It's painfully formulaic. The script probably wrote itself. I'm sure the special effects were ""special"" back in the day, but they're barely mediocre by today's standards, and without them the plot hardly qualifies as a skeleton. ""Bad Boys"" is like food that has been so processed it has no nutritional value left. So why am I still giving it 5 stars? Basically, because I have only myself to blame. If you buy a bag of potato chips, you really shouldn't be complaining about getting a bag of potato chips. I would even have given it 6 stars, except that these chips are a bit too stale and soggy. They're certainly not Ruffles. My rating only reflects my feeling that this ""product"" likely has appeal to aficionados of classic action flicks.

Ok you got Cage in Con Air, but with this one two great stars are born. First of all Will Smith, all of his following movies were pretty good and successful (except Wild Wild West) and of course one of the best new Directors of the 90's, Michael Bay. He is terrific, the way he works with the camera man, slow motion, turns, colours, really GREAT. You see the music  video influence. Michael Bay is going to be one of the greatest soon (among Spielberg, Cameron and Lucas), with his status proven with The Rock (his best one yet (GREAT FLICK!!)) and Armageddon (pretty good, but better at the box - office) and now he's making Pearl Harbour well this is a success story that will carry on for a long time.
Well back to the film, everybody is great here, but I must say I especially like Tea Leoni and Theresa Randle and I regret that I haven't seen those pretty and talented young ladies in other big and good movies except Randle in Space Jam three years ago and Leoni in Deep Impact (which was big but not that good) two years ago. Well the last thing I want to say goes out to Bruckheimer, please make a sequel with as much of the original cast and crew as possible, it is bound to be great. Do it, there have been sequels of worse films made a success. And by the way, you have a little few action movies on your list right now (those are the flicks that made you great REMEMBER THAT!!), so I suggest you make Bad Boys 2 to cash a few bucks more that you will with Remember the Titans, Coyote Ugly and Gone in 60 Seconds. OK Pearl Harbour will be big business, but that's not an action movie like Con Air, Face/Off, Bad Boys, Lethal Weapon or Die Hard, so do BB 2. Also make another action flick with Bruce Willis!!!!!!!!

92,ivo-cobra8,"One of my all time favorite best action buddy cop films of my childhood, I love it to death!",10,17 October 2016,"Bad Boys (1995) is the best Michael Bay's buddy action movie, my all time favorite buddy cop film starring Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. This is a film that I really do believe that it is a classic action movie of the 90's. This is my childhood movie my all time classic action buddy cop films honestly? I think it is MILES way better action movie than Lethal Weapon and Beverly Hills Cop, but that is just me and my opinion. I love this film to death it is my all time favorite Michael Bay film along with The Rock (1996), Transformers and Transformers: Dark of the Moon. I saw this movie probably over 10.0000 times more than the sequel, my mom bought me a VHS tape which I still have it. I bought this movie on Blu-Ray years ago and no I don't have (Mastered in 4K) I have a normal Blu-ray disc. The only thing that bothers me is a green cover which does not fit to this film. This is my all time favorite Will Smith movie I grew up watching his TV show The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990 - 1996) and Bad Boys become my favorite Will Smith film along side Bad Boys II and Independence Day, these are my all time favorite Will Smith movies that he did. Someday I am going to re watch Men In Black trilogy.Plot: Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are Miami Police Department detectives who find themselves protecting a murder witness while investigating a case of stolen heroin from a dangerous drug lord.The basically plot for this movie is about a 100 million dollars Heroin is stolen from the police headquarters. Two police officers have 72 hours to reclaim the heroin before the Internal Affairs Division gets involved and close their department forever and everyone on the force will lose their job. Their is a lot on stake and only one witness is ready to identify a drug dealer in return to get a justice for her murdered best friend.Why I love this film: This movie has practical everything has ton's of action, great dialogues, a few comedy scenes and a great babes including great theme scores by Mark Mancina. The chemistry between the lead is well written and I love the story off the two unlikely heroes who protect innocent people. It's filled with non-stop action. Michael Bay did a great job, it has awesome action with gory gun fights, fast car chases, massive explosions, but is still funny with Will and Martin.This is a prototypical ""good"" action movie -- intense, perfectly executed, original action, shown to the tune of a forgettable and occasionally insulting story.The final shoot-out in the airport hanger is one of my favorite action scenes from Michael Bay and it's all beautifully shot.Téa Leoni is hot, gorgeous and sexy as Julie Mott a murder witness she is so charming and beautiful heart in this movie.This film is dark and sometimes is really scary when the moment like Will Smith is attacked in pimp's dark house and thrown out of the window.Mark Mancina gives his second best score (after Speed) which also is very similar in tone. You can tell it's from the same guy. It's got a great theme tune, screeching electric guitars and some funky hip hop beats too.Tchéky Karyo almost steals the movie as the villain Fouchet; he just oozes menace and when he's on screen there is a constant threat of impending violence. Tchéky played another bad guy villain in Jet Li's Kiss of the Dragon (2001), so i saw him twice as a bad guy.The heroes in this movie are two Police Officers Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) who are well written and they are very likable. My favorite character is Mike Lowrey. I love the switch identities that was really hilarious and funny, I laughed my ass off on Martin's character.There's no shaky cam or CGI here but real explosions, Hard-R fight scenes and some nice one-liners.I love Bad Boys song on the end of the title credits performed by Inner Circle.Of course, this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The gunplay in this movie is delivered in a perfect Bay-Lawrence-Smith style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you'll see a lot of hand guns and heavy automatic weapons, and you'll see them used well. Hard explosions and an awesome bad ass car chase on the end of the movie! The film is violent, and bloody, but ALL of the mean-spirited violence is dealt by the evil characters, not the ones you root for (Quentin Tarantino fans: sorry). And then the truly amazing scenes that bypass acting are shocking and memorable -- just wait for the bad guy (Tchéky Karyo) been shoot to death by Will Smith on the end sequence.Splitting the difference, I am giving an 10/10 -- an outstanding score.Bad Boys is a 1995 American buddy cop action-comedy film directed by Michael Bay, produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer and starring Martin Lawrence and Will Smith as two narcotic Miami detectives Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey. The first in the Bad Boys franchise, the film was followed by a sequel, Bad Boys II (2003).10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Columbia Pictures Starring: Martin Lawrence, Will Smith, Téa Leoni, Tchéky Karyo, Theresa Randle, Joe Pantoliano, Frank John Hughes, Nestor Serrano, Julio Oscar Mechoso, Kim Coates, Marg Helgenberger Director: Michael Bay Producers: Don Simpson, Jerry Bruckheimer Screenplay: Michael Barrie, Jim Mulholland, Doug Richardson Story by George Gallo Rated: R Running Time: 1 Hr. 59 Mins.

93,fernandoschiavi,"A competent buddy cop mix from the 90s, with the differential of Bay knowing how to explore the comic dynamics between Martin Lawrence and Will Smith",6,22 August 2020,"In 1995, Michael Bay was not yet a name of strong appeal in Hollywood. At the time, the director had only directed music videos and television commercials when producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson asked him to lead Bad Boys, an action comedy devised by George Gallo. This would become his first feature film that would kick-start one of those who would become one of the greatest directors of recent decades, amending several box office hits. Nowadays, it is no longer possible to debate that we are facing a director who is fully aware of his own cinema and who follows his own style - which, however, is not a guarantee of success. The 360º turns on the faces of actors, the slow-motion in an epic tone, the perforated action, the fetish of shooting always at sunset, thin women with voluptuous breasts and, of course, the stereotypical humor of their films already they were all there. Affectionately dubbed Bayhem (a mixture of the surname Bay with the word mayhem, which means chaos in English), it is curious to see how his birth occurred in this film, in the mid-1990s.In the plot, we are introduced to the police duo Mike (Will Smith) and Marcus (Martin Lawrence), the two need to investigate the theft of a heroin load that occurred inside the police station itself. In the midst of this, there is Julie (Téa Leoni), a witness who witnessed a murder that is linked to the theft of the drug shipment. So for some ""witness protection"", the two policemen will need to pretend that they are the other and that will make their lives a little bit complicated.Bay's debut appears to be genuinely based on the relationship between detectives Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) as its driving force. In the best buddy cop style, Bad Boys bet on this dynamic between two opposite personalities who need to live together. In fact, this is something that has been enunciated since the first scene, in which the two manage to get out of a situation that they are hostages, precisely by staging a fight between themselves so that the assailants are distracted. This contrast between Marcus and Mike is further deepened when the two need to change their identity for much of the film, turning into a true staging comedy, although none of this makes much sense in the script. On the other hand, it is the classic situation of literally putting yourself in the other's shoes to better understand your life and the choices you have made.The secondary characters at least are full of charisma, whether it be Captain Howard, of Joe Pantoliano, a looted, funny and basketball-addicted fellow, or Marcus's family, Milke's porter or a murder witness, Julie Mott, played in turn by Tea Leoni beginner, but still very important for the whole plot, thanks among other things for his strong presence. In addition to them, there is the tire maker Jojo, played by Michael Imperioli four years before the Soprano Family.Working as a living element in the film, it is evident that Bay uses a visual contrast to portray two very different Miamis, which consequently generate different atmospheres. First, we have the sunny orange of the outdoors, a rap playing in the background and the simple day-to-day life of Marcus and Mike. The city looks friendly and inviting. Later, the night takes over and Bay bet on a blue that, together with a smoky lighting, dictates a much darker tone for the story. For example, the death of Max (Karen Alexander), Julie's friend, is the moment that the director most seems to drink from the sources of a Brian De Palma or Hitchcock mannerism in his career, stylizing the scene's suspense to the maximum through close-ups and slow motion.
As the script by Michael Barrie, Jim Mulholland and Doug Richardson is not a masterpiece and does not seek to reinvent anything, the characters' personality ends up being very basic, Lowrey reminds a lot of the Will of the series that was not over yet, mainly for being a very womanizer charming, and Burnett is the typical insecure Negro. The various holes in the script are covered by an uninterrupted series of action scenes, alternating with funny ones. If we start to question the need for the exchange of identities, the difficulty of the dangerous bandits eliminating the witness, among others, the film becomes unpalatable. Bad Boys still bears marks from its era of achievement. Many scenes have smoke, beams of light coming in through the window are there. These and other aspects make the film already partially dated. We see communications made by beep, at a time when the cell phone was practically still taking its first steps and the landline phone still dominated communications, in addition to classic jurassic operating systems and monitors, costumes and makeup from the 1990s. Even the sound of gunshots. and explosions refer to the sound effects of the 1980s, as well as the sources of inspiration ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Die Hard"".Away from all the visual chaos for which Michael Bay's films became known, still with a not-so-generous budget even though it is a blockbuster, the explosions and action are more restrained and less spectacular, inserted in specific moments. The highlight even goes to the chase after an escape from a nightclub involving explosions in ether barrels, the chase scene with much rush through the streets of Miami after a kidnapping, and the exaggerated final sequence in an airport hangar, but it works, just before a breathtaking high-speed chase.Music is an important element in the film, both the score composed by Mark Mancina, which sets the tone for Mark and Mike's wanderings, and the Inner Circle theme, which was used as the opening of the COPS series, and is sung by both police as they follow the trail of heroin traffickers. There is not much complexity in villains and opponents, they are basically clustered and visually scary, they do not have many layers, they are generic, scared and violent mobsters, as was typical of programs like the aforementioned COPS, Miami Vice etc., and this whole climate works, because the viewer feels familiar.The Bad Boys are very much the result of their time, they do not try to be revolutionary, they are just fun, full of action, humor and violence, showing the vigilantes and defenders of the law as people of dubious morals, with defects, hostages to their selfish feelings, showing clear difficulties in giving or not vanity or revenge, in a plot with multiple twists and turns.Of all of Michael Bay's works, his debut in Bad Boys appears as one of the director's most restrained and drinks the most references - in fact, in the future, Bay will start sucking references from his own films. Without fully embracing its visual chaos, it is already possible to see some flirtations of what would come next in future works. Other than that, the film is configured as a competent buddy cop mix from the 90s, with the differential of Bay knowing how to explore the comic dynamics between Martin Lawrence and Will Smith, and a thriller with traces of mannerism. The action and humor are balanced, although the humor is a little prejudiced, the chase scenes are exciting, something that would also become one of the director's marks and the soundtrack also works very well. The film not only elevated Michael Bay's status to a film director, it also catapulted Will Smith to Hollywood star status. A film that can amuse even those who don't like the director's films.",Bad Boys

Certainly the characterizations are shallow and quickly changeable, often for little or no reason.As social commentary I give it an eight; for story and acting a five.

103,LebowskiT1000,One of the best action films ever made! Great fun!,10,1 February 2003,"I've read a number of other reviews on this site and I have to say that I'm shocked that some people feel so strongly in the opposition of this film. This film is, without a doubt, one of my favorite action/comedies!!!The action is non-stop and VERY well done, quite intense.  The story is excellent.  The cast is nearly perfect, with a number of superb characters. The cinematography is fantastic, as is the overall direction of the film. Michael Bay is a truly fantastic director.  Yeah, he's a bit ""flashy"", but doesn't over-do it (too much) and he has just enough of the flash in his films.  Personally, I love his style.As I mentioned above, the cast is excellent.  At first I wasn't sure if I could accept Will Smith in this role, since I'd only seen him in ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air"", but he really nailed the role and did an excellent job. Martin Lawrence is usually not an actor I enjoy watching on the screen, but he was able to pull it off.  Sometimes his comedy is very funny, but at other times, I can't help but cringe.  Joe Pantoliano is a personal favorite of mine, his character in this film is nothing less than perfect.  I enjoyed every scene with him in it.  Tea Leoni was a perfect choice for her role, she looks great and pulls of the character quite nicely.  Tcheky Karyo shows his true acting talent in this film, excellent antagonist.  Marg Helgenberger was a nice touch in the film, although her role is somewhat small, yet important to the story.  Theresa Randle was another nice touch, very well done.  The entire cast is superb in the film.The humor in this film is very well placed, very good and extremely abundant.  I can't remember a time that I've laughed more during an action-comedy film.  Will Smith's comedy is superb as is Martin Lawrence, for the most part.  The chemistry between Will and Martin is very good, you can tell that they had a lot of fun with their characters.If you are into action films, then you should definitely check this out.  Be warned though, this film is rated R for its violence and language, and there are plenty of both.  I cannot wait for the upcoming sequel, also directed by Michael Bay, it's going to awesome!  I truly hope that you'll see the film and I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Bad Boys

105,dilipbts,Bad boys,8,7 June 2020,"I had no high hopes when I walked into this film. I like Will Smith, I like Martin Lawrence, so I figured this film will at least be funny. And it was funny, and then some. It was action packed, thrilling and a helluva good time. I came out of the theatre thinking that the guy who directed that movie is going to be huge.Michael Bay, former music video and commercial director, has made an incredible directorial debut. The film never stops. When it isn't action-packed, it is funny. It is sexy, fun and always moving. Christian Wagner's editing is phenomenal. I love action movies that really try to be action movies. A lot of action films know that they are action films so they try to incorporate other genres to make the film more complete, but they often fail miserably. They try so hard to be something they are not that they forget what they are in the first place. The essence of the action film is the action. It is a necessary component, it needs to be there otherwise it loses its edge. ""Bad Boys"" doesn't just throw in the occassional action sequence to meet the expectations of the genre, but instead uses the action to help tell the story. It is this use of filmmaking that allows an action film to remain an action film and still go beyond.Watch ""Bad Boys"" again and every time there is an action sequence, ask yourself why that was there and what did it accomplish. You will find that each sequence took the film to another level; it introduced an new conflict, it increased the present conflict, it eliminated a key character, it introduced a new character, and so on. There are a lot of action films out there that sacrifice story for spectacle, and the audience notices this. At the centre of all films lies the story and if it comes to a halt so does the interest of the viewers.""Bad Boys"" of course isn't the greatest story on film, or even in the action genre, but what is so appealing and memorable about ""Bad Boys"" is that it is just as entertaining with its story as it is with its action by combining the two without sacrificing either. Michael Bay understands the importance of the story within the structure of the film. He tells a visual story, entertaining and complete, and leaves you very satisfied. Watch for Michael Bay because he is here to stay.",Bad Boys
106,saadanathan,Nice action but an average cop movie 6/10,6,27 June 2020,"Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are great actors who do a fantastic job in the film. But even they can't save the movie from becoming an average cop chase movie, with explosions and curses all over the place. The villains are not interesting and feel kind of empty. There is no emotion or twist in the villains actions thus they have no quality. It seems like the director made an action movie full of cops and robbers with no impact. The personal lives of the characters are not interesting, the dynamic between mike lowrey (Smith) and Marcus burnett (Lawrence) is pretty simple, they are partners and they have nothing in common but they are a good team. If I wrote the script, I would have made both of them partners for the first time. Not partners for years but new partners and then see how they work together. Kind of like a situation where two people are forced to work together even though it's their first time. I think that idea would have worked better.",Bad Boys

The biggest surprise is that Martin Lawrence can act, he's doing a really good job here, and opposite Smith, it's hard to pull attention. The other thing to note is that Will Smith's character has a trust fund, that's a throwaway detail to explain why he can afford a hundred thousand dollar piece of crass product placement. I'm sure this is not brought back up again. Mark Mancina's score is a delicious blend of neo-noir and late 80's action movie stingers.

111,stevenrotherforth,"Looks good, sounds ok on 4K Blu-ray",9,16 September 2019,"Bad BoysBad Boys became an instant action movie classic upon its release and we had to wait some eight years for the eagerly anticipated sequel.
I remember going to the cinema and seeing Michael Bay's unique style of direction.
Bay might have sullied his reputation recently with the dire sequel after sequel of the worn Transformers franchise but Bad Boys was his debut and say what you will. He is one of the finest when it comes to visual splendour.
He often uses vibrant colours and filters that make his movies pop.
He has a very distinctive style of direction making it easy to identify his work.Bad Boys stars Martin Lawrence and Will Smith as two LAPD detectives.
The film follows their exploits as they try to capture Drug thieves and solve a murder case before their department is shut down.
With strong support from Joe Pantoliano as their Captain and a villainous performance from Tcheky Karyo.
Michael Bay blends humour that is expertly delivered by his two young leads with some breathtaking none stop action.
Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have a superb onscreen chemistry and their relationship is comical to behold.
There's been many a buddy cop movie over the years and Bad Boys can rank among the best.
I actually prefer the long awaited sequel out of the two but this movie is also pure eye candy.Michael Bay's style transfers on to 4K Blu-ray effectively.
That said this is by no means a reference transfer.
Sure it looks good. Shot on 35mm there's still a noticeable amount of grain but this never distracts.
Just don't expect a 4K crisp image.
HDR allows colours to pop here and there but it is more of a solid upgrade over the Blu-ray rather than a 4K revelation.
This is certainly the best the movie has ever looked.
Shame then that the Dolby Atmos mix offers little punch for an action movie. Especially one directed by Michael Bay.
Usually his movies have a thunderous sound mix.
Gun shots are limp. Explosions lack impact. Only the musical score has any flavour.
There's some good sound placement and overhead effects are abundant.
Sadly the mix is a little flat and is dynamically lacking.
Audio quality from this 1995 classic shows its age. It is by no means bad but by today's standards it is a little feeble.
If you consider that Saving Private Ryan was released some three years later. Comparing the sound quality of the two 4K discs.
The Spielberg movie is in a different league.Bad Boys is a thoroughly enjoyable action movie and is decent on 4K Blu-ray.
I'm looking forward to checking out Bad Boys 2 in UHD.
The sequel was demo worthy back in the day on standard DVD so it should look great with superior resolution and HDR.",Bad Boys

Okay as usual you see a great Will Smith (the guy is just a godlike appearance on your screen) but all by all this was just a sort of Beverly Hills Cop filmed ten years later and with a new black cop. The acting is average and the story is so ridiculous you better not think about it as all by all this is like an episode from Miami Vice filmed with a bigger budget....,Bad Boys
113,thomasjay-2201,Bay's Best,7,25 January 2019,"As the title suggests, this is probably the best film made by Michael Bay, and wow it was a great watch. A simple enough story that's made by the cast of Will Smith, Martin Lawrence and Tea Leoni who's interplay is the best asset of the film. Providing laughs and humour and solid relationships between the characters there's a lot to enjoy from the film, be that the leads of the story in general. The action is fairly grounded and also spectacular, particularly the final sequence. In all a solid, entertaining film that's definitely worth a watch",Bad Boys
114,HelenMary,"visually exciting, amusing and entertaining - a sexy action film",7,1 February 2013,"Bad Boys is reminiscent of Beverley Hills Cop - it showed off LA, beautiful women, blue skies and palm lined boulevards, and this shows off Miami and looks impressive, it's shot expansively and affectionately... it's a show piece. A blockbuster - no expense spared. Lowry and Burnett (Will Smith and Martin Lawrence) are Miami PD and working on a drug bust heist from within the PD itself. It's a big film, even on a small screen you get the impression of scale, and everything is impressive. You are treated to slow motion shots accentuating our heroes in grand cinematography-style, long chases with Will Smith's shirt wide open, model-esque women everywhere, and everything is just glamorous. Tea Leoni is the ""love interest"" but in a messed up sort of way because she's in the middle of a subterfuge and Lowry and Burnett have switched roles... she witnessed her best friend get shot and is now the target, and Lowry is looking after her, except it's Burnett and his wife is MAD. It's typical action-adventure stuff; huge scenes, car chases, big stunts, car chases, explosions, wanton disregard of realistic police procedure, respect for human life or property and thinking nothing of blowing up a motorway etc ... very similar in feel to Speed, which incidentally has a very similar theme tune to Bad Boys (along with The Rock), and all three are exciting and ramp up the feeling of action. There's a lot of comedy - between Smith and Lawrence, in their fast talking brash way, then there's the sarcastic humour of their boss Joe Pantoliano (Matrix) in similar fashion to John C McGinley in Point Break, then there's the situational comedy of things being silly and going wrong and you really get the connection between Smith and Lawrence as actors - they play it well. There is a really good chemistry between them, and it's quite a bromance movie as well as action (I have no idea whether the two are friends in real life but their relationship is believable on screen). The plot is of course the least of importance in this film and is rather flimsy, but films like this are about visuals and Bad Boys is a great watch that you can watch again and again. It hasn't aged too badly - except in terms of technology (pagers and large in car phones) - and Will Smith is always a joy to watch. Tea Leoni is very good, and oddly believable in her role and her chemistry with the two actors was fun. It's a sexy film; Smith just is as he is so assured of himself, but also the chemistry between Leoni and Smith, although it's not at the forefront of the plot. It's clichéd left right and centre, of course, nothing original, or particularly challenging but not mindless, and I wouldn't be giving out any Oscars but everything comes together to create something you want to go to the cinema to see. It's a very entertaining action film with the added and lightening aspect of comedy. Generally speaking action films like this are for the boys in the audience but there is most definitely plenty in it for the girls so a win win for everyone.",Bad Boys

All of those elements make Bad Boys one of better Action movies of the 1990s that is Michael Bay,Martin Lawrence and Will Smith at their best.Set in Miami,Florida,Bad Boys tells the story of Marcus Burnett(Martin Lawrence)and Mike Lowery(Will Smith)long time best friends who are also Cops and partners in the Miami Police department and are good at their jobs. When a large supply of Heroin is stolen from the police department Burnett and Lowery have to try and get back the dope while protecting and watching over a murder witness Julie(Tea Leoni)with Action,thrills and laughs coming from every corner.Released in 1995,Bad Boys is a terrific,Action-packed and hilarious Action-Comedy that looking back on the movie seemed like a big gamble at the time because it was the directorial debut of director Michael Bay with Martin Lawrence and Will Smith(who were both on very funny hit Sitcoms Martin and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air)in lead roles. But the gamble was a big pay off with Bad Boys grossing 141 Million dollars dollars worldwide at the Box Office and is one of the better Action-Buddy-Comedy films in the genre that is still watched to this very day and is one of my favorite Action-Comedies. Bad Boys is a movie that I have loved since I first saw it in theaters in 1995 and is a film that I watch to this very day whenever it's and is just a movie that is just pure,solid entertainment from start to finish for 2 whole hours with Action,thrills and laughs that come at a non-stop rate and is a film that grabs your attention with lots of style. While Bad Boys has an air of predictability and the storyline isn't very groundbreaking or revolutionary there is just something about Bad Boys that makes it so re-watchable after many viewings. The Action scenes in Bad Boys are terrific and memorable with plenty of gunfights,explosions and chases that are exciting and well-done like any Jerry Bruckheimer-Don Simpson production. All of the Bruckheimer and Simpson style is in this film:slow motion,flashy visual style and camera movements presented in all of it's glory in this film. Also,Miami,Florida in Bad Boys is stunning and gorgeous and is one of the best movies set in Miami because with Bad Boys you as a viewer are sucked into Miami and you are having fun while being thrilled. The Comedy and laughs in Bad Boys are just hilarious and funny with scenes and dialog that come alive thanks to the antics of Burnett and Lowery whether it's the back and forth bickering between them or the one-liners that are said. The thing that makes Bad Boys so entertaining all of these years what holds the movie together is the duo Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery. Unlike most Buddy movies or Action-Buddy-Comedy where the duo are put together and take time to gel together,Burnett and Lowery are already partners and best friends who know each other like the back of their hands. You feel like there is a love and brotherhood between the two and when there is always trouble they will be there for one another no matter what. We also see the differences between them in terms of their personal lives where Burnett is a married man with kids and Lowery is a bachelor with a lavish life style,but when they get into a shootout or chase the two manage to work together and get the job done. Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery are a great and funny duo that are in my opinion one of the better buddy cop duos in the Action-Comedy sub genre. The ending of Bad Boys is fantastic and great with plenty of Action and thrills that will leave viewers smiling and wanting more. A wonderful ending.The cast is wonderful. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are excellent and hilarious as Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery,with Lawrence and Smith being funny and having great chemistry. Tea Leoni is terrific,beautiful and sexy as Julie,a witness who's being watched by Burnett and Lowery. Tcheky Karyo is fantastic as Fouchet,the main villain. Joe Pantoliano is great as Captain Howard,Burnett and Lowery's commander. Theresa Randle is memorable and beautiful as Theresa Burnett,Marcus' wife. Vic Manni(Ferguson),Frank John Hughes(Casper),Nestor Serrano(Detective Sanchez),Julio Oscar Mechoso(Detective Ruiz),Marg Helgenberger(Captain Ailson Sinclair),Michael Imperioli(Jojo),Saverio Guerra(Chet),Mark Macauley(Noah),Karen Alexander(Max),Emmanuel Xuereb(Eddie Dominguez)and John Salley(Fletcher)give good performances as well.The direction by Michael Bay is wonderful and stylish,with Bay giving the movie a nice pace and a cool visual style using different angles and doing a great job with the Action scenes. Fine direction,Bay.The score by Mark Mancina is great,intense and matches the Action throughout the film. Good score,Mancina. There is also a terrific Hip-Hop/R&B soundtrack with songs that goes with the energy of the film.In final word,if you love Michael Bay,Martin Lawrence,Will Smith,Action films or Action-Comedies,I highly suggest you see Bad Boys an excellent,thrilling and hilarious Action-Comedy that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Bad Boys

Lets first go to Bad Boys.This film is actually the first film done by Micheal Bay and this movie is very hidden in the shaddows along with the sequel. I am here to dig them up and talk them over.The film is about 2 cops Mike Lowry played by Will Smith and Marcus Burnett played by Martin Lawrence who have just 72 hours to reclaim a consigment of drugs and protecting a witness to a murder named Julie Mott played by Tea Leoni.The film has intense action, great comedy and is entertaining every single minute. I have heard talk about a third movie an I do hope it comes about.

We all know how funny and succesfull was Will Smith in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air with some over the top comedy, maybe the best comedy series I've ever watched. Martin Lawrence is even better, funnier than Will, which he proves in a dozen films, especially Nothing to Lose with Tim Robbins. Anyway, for me, this original movie does not manage to deliver as much comedy as I expected, some scenes are to long and boring, altho the comedy is there.

Swearing and action violence that keeps the thrill's coming and the action rolling. Bad Boy's, which was made in 1995 has had an advantage over previous cop thriller's, firstly there's more hype and suspense than previous and secondly u could never get bored of Smith or Lawrence, especially in these genre's.As for Michael Bay, who has had a bumpy directorial path along the way, end's his shame and misery here, and still ""has got it"" in the sequel- Bad Boy's 2. So respect's to him, and the stunt coordinator's worthily deserve stupendous credit for part 2, whereas, shades of the action are lost in part 1.

128,kingofdanerds,Michael Bay's big theatrical debut: Bad Boys,7,10 May 2021,"Michael Bay has certainly made lots of money directing and producing (even if it is not that great) movies. But oddly enough, his directorial debut was a buddy cop film called Bad Boys. Bad Boys was released in 1995 and was Michael Bay's first big budget theatrical film. The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson. The film stars Will Smith (Fresh Prince of Bel Air and Independence Day), Martin Lawrence (Life and Big Momma's House), Tea Leoni (Jurassic Park III and Madam Secretary), and Joe Pantoliano (The Goonies and Grand Theft Auto III) all of which is just to name a few. Bad Boys was a huge success commercially perhaps thanks to it's relatively low budget of $19 million. The film was not a huge critical success but has gained a huge following since.Marcus is the cop who lives paycheck to paycheck and has a family. Mike is the rich cop who does not have a family to help raise. Marcus and Mike are both partners for the Miami police and after seizing over $100 million in heroin, they only have five days to find out who it is that stole all of the heroin.Bad Boys is one of those films I fondly remember from the days of old. So it was nice to return to this one after a few years and I was pleased for the most part. Bad Boys is a fun film, not a perfect film though. I should get out the obvious negatives. First, the story. Even Michael Bay himself admitted that he was given a bad screenplay and while it is not the worst, it certainly is not great. The film takes a huge amount of time to tell a story that could easily be told in less amount of time. Which is ultimately done and the remaining time is dedicated to Will Smith and Martin Lawrence who truly shine here. Now I am fine with the comedy. In fact, I got a huge laugh out of most of the jokes and lines in the film. But put it into context of the story and see that the story itself stops. There is no progression. Again, Smith and Lawrence are comedy gold and their chemistry really really works here and really is what makes me like this film. Without them, this would be just a generic buddy cop action film. Which leads me to the second complaint. The cliche buddy cop aspect. Bad Boys does nothing new with the buddy cop genre whatsoever. It is full of cliches and what not but that does not mean that I do not have a fun time watching this film. I really do. The third and final major complaint is the action. This is all partly due to the budget that was given for this film. We have a few explosions here and there and let's be honest, it can be fun. Just nothing groundbreaking. Some of the action is all in close up which can be a little annoying as I want to see everything that goes on. Outside of the negatives, the acting is fairly good. Again, Lawrence and Smith really shine here and are very memorable. Lots of their lines were improvised and it truly works. They truly save the film because if they were not in this film, I would be giving this film less than a 5/10 rating.Bad Boys is nothing remarkable save for the two leads who are the most (in my opinion) iconic duo in buddy cop film history. The action is solid but yet again, nothing too remarkable but it is a fun film to sit down and watch.",Bad Boys
129,welhof1,Nice action flick,7,9 February 2020,Action scenes were incredible and very nicely done. I miss brainless 90's action movies like this one. Just sit down and be entertained for 90 minutes. Nothing wrong with that.I didn't care for the banter and yelling back and forth between the two. It was a bit much at times.Overall a definite watch if you're in the mood for a quick action movie!,Bad Boys
130,bmiller59,So many things to like,10,12 April 2020,"Where to start. I haven't seen Bad Boys since it first came out, and I forgot just about everything except for a couple scenes. Amazing.Michael Bay, though this wasn't his first directorial debut, it was his first action movie. How can he top this?, he has. Bay's directing is so distinctive, everything blowing up in a spectacular fashion and the action sequences are so hard core.Smith & Lawerence, great combo. I'm not a big fan of Martin Lawrence, but with Will Smith, they're a great combo. Timing and chemistry is awesome, and their comedy together is like they know what the other is going to say.Supporting cast is dead on. Starting with Tea Leoni, and Joe Pantoliano, they all play great supporting roles. I always go for the villan and Tcheky Karyo is excellent, why haven't I seen him in many other bad guy rolls?Oh yea, besides standing on its own as an action film, the comedy is first rate.Can't wait to watch Bad Boys 2...again, but I already forget it's premise.",Bad Boys
131,refinedsugar,"All sizzle, no steak.",5,8 March 2001,"Bad Boys is the type of action flick I'm becoming accustomed to seeing Hollywood pump out. Put a glossy shine of new paint on the same old ideas but without any heart. Throw money at the screen. Put the emphasis on explosions and gunshots. Disregard characters and story. It's very much a hit or miss affair.This flick has a lot of fans, but I can't get behind it because it simply doesn't work very well. It pours a lot of talent into trying to be as hip and loud as possible, but boil it down. Remove the two high profile lead actors. Take away the infamous licensed song from Inner Circle the movie owes it's identity (and title) to and in no way is Bad Boys memorable. There wasn't a joke, set piece, or crazy stunt that forever immortalized it in pop culture or to set it apart from the long list of action flicks I've saw.The best thing that can be said about Bad Boys is Will Smith. He has a certain level of charm and easy-going coolness about him, he's easy to like and he's not a bad actor either. However that doesn't shade the fact that the movie's villain is in no way memorable, the story is predictable and borderline stupid without the much needed fun factor to counterbalance it, and Martin Lawrence is often annoying.I think when people look back and try to remember why they liked this entry into the buddy cop genre, they're going to have a hard time. It doesn't ask much of you, but the style the movie wants you to buy into never once feels real. It's manufactured and soulless. I'm sure the bantering between Smith and Lawrence took a lot of work to get right too, but it feels forced. The kind of crazy cool tough guy dialog you expect guys in slick, over the top action vehicles to say. Not an original bone in it's body, Bad Boys has entertained many of people, but it didn't do much for me.",Bad Boys
132,shaun98,So-so,5,22 February 2004,"(Possible spoiler here)Plot -- Two vice cops (Martin Lawrence and Will Smith) must protect a young woman who is the only witness against a lethal drug lord. Also at stake is millions worth of heroin, stolen from a police evidence locker.Critique -- ""Bad Boys"" is an appropriately mediocre feature film debut for director Michael Bay. Though clearly intended as an action-comedy, the film does not deliver enough laughs or thrills to be anything other than a passable time-waster. It's one of these movies you rent on a rainy Sunday afternoon, only to forget the next day. I'm shocked it was such a hit, but I guess the stars had a lot of fans (I do like Smith, but I don't run out to catch everything he appears in).Lawrence and Smith both have strong screen presence, but they've done better in other movies. As the story unfolds, circumstances force them to exchange identities, in a plot development that is...contrived, to say the least. I could practically hear the plot-mechanisms creaking and groaning. Still, it's not a total loss. The final half hour is quite diverting, with two consecutive action scenes. The two stars, as well as Joe Pantoliano as an obnoxious but dedicated police captain, have an undeniable charisma. ""Bad Boys"" has a slick, glossy sheen throughout. But that isn't enough to recommend the film. It's most telling that according to the Internet Movie Database, even Bay himself disliked the script, and had the stars improvise certain lines. This movie goes on for much too long; its flaws would have been less apparent in a tighter film. In fact, I would have welcomed more explosions and a higher body count.Rating: (**) out of fourReleased by Columbia Pictures",Bad Boys

136,clydestuff,How do you spell garbage? B-A-D B-O-Y-S,2,7 August 2003,"Bad Boys, unlike Bad Boys II, that spawned from the loins of this film, runs less then two hours, coming in at 118 minutes.  The reason I mention this is because I wanted to start my comments by saying something positive about this film.Bad Boys is without a doubt one of the more insipid, tasteless, humorless comedy/action films ever to be put on celluloid.  Bad Boys is so bad it makes a film like Smokey And The Bandit look like Academy Award stuff in comparison.  At the beginning of this film, we get a group of criminals, led by the evil head criminal Fouchet(Tcheky Karyo), who are intelligent enough to steal $100 million dollars in heroin from a police vault.  Unfortunately for them, they get away with the heroin, but leave their brains back in the vault as they then become the stupidest criminals to pull off a heist since Peter Falk concocted The Brink's Job.  They kill stupidly and randomly, starting with a girl friend of Mike Lowery(Will Smith), then one of their own guys, all in front of a witness, Julie Mott (Tea Leoni).  So of course instead of going into hiding, getting their job done and selling the heroin, they decide it's a better idea to chase down Mott and shoot at some cops, shoot up the city and make themselves as conspicuous as possible.  Compared to the actions of Marcus Burnett(Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowery though, these drug dealers are Einstein.Burnett and Lowery are partners, who must find the heroin and the crooks, protect Mott, their only witness, and do it within three days time so their department doesn't get closed down and they are out of a job.  We know this because their boss Capt. Howard(Joe Pantoliano)keeps calling them in to yell, scream and holler this point several times during the film so that they couldn't possibly forget let alone the audience.  As if all this wasn't enough, we get this totally ridiculous side plot, having to do with mistaken identity, that is straight out of an old Doris Day/Rock Hudson movie.  Why they put it in this film is beyond me and totally unnecessary.  It does give Martin Lawrence a chance to do mug for the camera, act stupid and annoying, sort of like Jerry Lewis in some of his worst movies.The only interesting worthwhile actor in this film is Tea Leoni, but they give her a case of the stupids along with everyone else so her performance is wasted.  Martin (I never met a four letter word that wasn't funny) Lawrence seems to have most of the screen time, and it is excruciating to watch.  Will Smith isn't quite as bad, but he just phones this one in and appears disinterested throughout.  The so called ""banter"" between Lowery and Burnett, is never funny just forced.  There is no rapport at all between them.Michael Bay might know how to stage an action sequence, he just doesn't know how to film one.  He seems to think that action sequences are the same as a music video, filming them with quick cuts, shaky camera, incomprehensible close-ups at crucial moments, slow motion of Burnett and Lowery firing their Weapons, so that when there is something going on it's unwatchable to the audience.  It is incomprehensible that this film did as well as it did.  It's amazing what star power will do I guess.  Worst then that, and even more astonishing, is that this mess bred a more inept sequel.  At least we had eight peaceful years before Bruckheimer and Bay dropped the second bomb.  Be thankful for small favors.",Bad Boys

140,Criticalstaff,A story about two black guys in a Porsche,5,3 May 2020,"The movie is like a dog chasing its own tail. It is absolutely unfocused and is in permanently distracted by itself.It starts as a strange rip-off of Lethal Weapon. Mixed in with Miami Vice. A buddy cop movie where two charismatic cops are (reluctantly) pitted together in a criminal case in search for justice and/or the truth. Bad Boys breaks new ground by having Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. They carry the movie. Not their characters, but the actors themselves. They are not particularly likeable or engaging, for instance Will Smith is a trust-fund kid that is a police officer by choice (I know it is just an excuse to have them drive a Porsche but still). For some reason Martin Lawrence steals actually the show, even though the police work aspect is dropped midway through and the humour stays juvenile. But Lawrence is the star of the movie. He give his character a good performance, and even has more screen-time than Smith.The first act of the movie, we are presented to something that pretends to be a police investigation. Although it is never really focused in the first place, the movie then rapidly shifts into a comedy premise of Smith playing Lawrence and Lawrence playing Smith. Full with jokes like: why are there pictures of Will Smith on your wall Martin Lawrence ? Are you the gay man ? (By the way why would there even be pictures of Will Smith at Will Smith's house? He is not living with his mom). If it was not bad enough the movie itself seem uninterested. The household drama is constantly interrupted to indulge in action set-pieces that are increasingly loud and impressive.The third act of the movie is two long action sequences interrupted by one scene at Police HQ (basically the I want you gun and your badge scene). It is not as bad, but it is a bit jarring. I guess it is there so there could be a ticking-clock.The action scenes themselves are not bad. They are very stylistic and there is some sort of mastery. They are somewhat clever visually and distinct. However, the rhythm makes them difficult to follow at times. The cuts are a little too fast and it is hard to follow who is doing what and where they are with respect to each other.The style of the film is its strong suit. It is not necessarily beautiful, but it is unique and original. Every action scene stands out. They all take place at a different and unique location; also, there is a low-key love of architecture and design. The sets are engaging and sometimes gorgeous. There is a fantastic scene where Joe Pants gives the two detectives exposition or orders or whatever, the whole scene takes place on a basketball court. It is dumb, it is unrealistic, but oh-boy is it unique and so striking visually.
That being said the style is so prevalent and strong it can become a bit abrasive.
The use of colours and contrast is unparalleled. But it is very bombastic. The movie does not really let us breathe in these things: we have to blow-up cars, shoot someone or some things and go to the next action set-piece. The movie is relentless.
And it is something that bizarrely devolves in the dialog too. Almost every line is shouted. Everybody shouts at everybody all the time. They don't talk, they shout. That is why the switcharoo 2nd act works so poorly, because these characters are not people, they are just angry cartoon cutouts. I would not say the characters are stereotypes or clichés, they are an even lower-form of characterisation.
The two leads are simultaneously annoyed and annoying. Victims and bullies. They both hate each other. One guy loves his family, the other loves his money. There is no conflict but there is still plenty of tension. The movie has tension without conflict, without stakes. And without resolution.Overall, the movie has some good elements. The visual style is very enjoyable, and it gives a subtle neo-noir feel sometimes. Moreover, the movie features Miami in glorious fashion, with its unique geography and landmarks; the movie is a celebration of Miami.However, the over-stylisation cannot save the movie from the lack of characters and depth. It is a very stylish and very flashy movie, but at the core, it is empty.",Bad Boys
141,rowanmaillot,Bad Boys- What you gonna do?,8,26 July 2020,"Bad Boys is by far the best buddy cop movie I have seen and one of the greatest action films of the 1990's! Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are the best parts about this movie and they absolutely steal the show every single scene they are in, their dialogue is amazing and this is action movie fun! If you go into this movie expecting the new ""Pulp Fiction"" or the new ""Shawshank Redemption"", you will not get that and you will leave disappointed, go in expecting a really fun awesome action, buddy-cop 1990's masterpiece that is absolutely what you are going to get. It's yet another divisive Michael Bay movie and this is his first movie that I've seen, and I'm pretty impressed. I know people call him one of the worst and most cliche directors working today, but maybe worst is a little bit too far. I was tossing between giving this movie an 8 or a 9, but after some long hours thinking about it, I'm going to give the movie an 8, I have issues with Bad Boys, it's by no means a flawless movie, but it's one I think I might re-watch another 20 times in the future, because it's such a re-watchable action movie, and I loved the scenes with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence talking together, I was laughing so hard.I don't want to review this movie in depth, because this is no movie to analyze and talk too much about, it's just a great time and an absolutely fantastic buddy-cop action comedy, that isn't really underrated, it just doesn't get talked about as much as some of the other buddy-cop movies, but Bad Boys is one of the most fun movie experiences I have had in recent memory.",Bad Boys
142,actionmoviestar,The movie that shows what Michael Bay was destined to be: a great action director,9,5 August 2006,"What do you get when you mix stolen drugs, too wise-cracking savvy cops and high octane action together? You get ""Bad Boys,"" the 1995 sleeper hit directed by a then unknown commercial director Michael Bay and staring two television stars named Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. ""Bad Boys"" is perhaps the epitome of the 90's with all it's stylishness and flashy colors that is guaranteed a rare treat for action fans.In every scene, it is evident that Martin Lawrence and Will Smith has chemistry and it is not hard to believe that some of their lines were improvised through the filming of this production.However most praises definitely go to the then, unknown Michael Bay who got his start in directing commercials and music videos. Every explosion and camera angle was a grave representation of what would become Michael Bay's trademark in his later films: directing visually stunning movies that make even the little guys look heroic and intimidating figures of royalty.If you haven't seen ""Bad Boys"" by now, you'll be doing a grave injustice to the world by not seeing it.

Bad Boys has a lot of action to it, gunfights, car chases, the usual points that a buddy film has. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence deliver good performances as the squabbling buddies who just want to get the bad guys.The film has explosive action like most films of the same genre, maybe this is why this is in most people's eyes only a moderately good film. But you must also remember the genre has been done so many times with sequels and badly made crossovers, Bad Boys isn't a cross over or just another cheap studio attempt. Michael Bay directed Bad Boys, and he has made his mark in the industry with the likes of The Rock and Transformers, maybe because he did this film is the reason why I love this film on a Friday night.This film I would recommend for mostly action junkies or just a movie for the boys hence the genre. Not much is new here to some critics, I would agree with them yes but I would also say that Bad Boys puts a new look to an old genre that has been re-done so many times very well.",Bad Boys
144,Legendary_Badass,Action packed and hilarious,9,27 March 2006,"With his 1995 directorial debut ""Bad Boys"", Michael Bay established himself as the premier action film director. Using a budget under 25 million dollars, and two stars in the making; Bay crafted an action film that delivers. The talented Will Smith and Martin Lawrence lend enduring charisma that helped revive a dying genre as well as create a comedy that can be appreciated across races.On a technical level, ""Bad Boys"" delivers amazing bang for the buck. Highly stylized gun fights combine flawlessly with chase sequences. The score by Mark Mancina is slick and draws the viewer into the world of our heroes. Filmed with vibrant reds and oranges, ""Bad Boys"" has a warm look that accentuates the heat of Miami. Quick editing serves to keep the laughs and action flowing, while still being simple enough to establish the surroundings.Comedy is difficult, but I dare say that ""Bad Boys"" is one of the funniest films I have viewed personally. The comedic skills of Lawrence and Smith shine brightly and are aided by Leoni in a refreshingly delightful performance. Lawrence and Smith are articulate while hip, breaking a color barrier between the humor of whites and blacks. More amazing is the meshing of action and comedy, as both are served as high points. Here is a world that is believable, action packed, funny, stylistic, and most importantly entertaining.",Bad Boys
145,rigovega,Lawrence and Smith do great together,6,18 October 2019,"There is some good chemistry between Lawrence and Smith here.

The dialogue is horrific, Martin and Smith is normally great at their game, but in this mess they don't know what the hell they are doing.

Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are two cops in Miami that have too swap identities in order to pan the lame screenplay out. I'm sorry I always try to describe the plot briefly. Something about a load of a heroin getting stolen from a police station, a dead prostitute, a dead prostitutes friend who only trusts Will Smith's character (Forgot his name in the film) even though she has never met him, then Martin Lawrence decides to pretend to be him on the orders of his chief because when she phoned saying she only trusted Smith's character, Smith was on the toilet.",Bad Boys

Will Smith was not as good in this movie as he was in Hitched but I'll give him a pass since when this movie came out, in 1995, William Smithsonian was turning 148 yrs/old and he's pretty close to retirement. My teacher's favorite scene in the movie is when Martin says ""LO-RIS-A!"" and then the dog destroys an expensive above ground pool. God bless the United States government for funding this production directly from the Pentagon and god bless Richard Nixon for faking our entry into the Spanish American war so that we could pay for it. In total Michael Bay and George Lucas's production quality on this was amazing and didn't cost a nickle, only $0.04! I loved the cameo from Bobby Kennedy though, very posh!

151,Rinho18,My number 136 movie ( contains story + spoilers ),8,4 February 2001,"´Bad Boys´  is my number 136 movie. ( outta 750 about )I do like it, because it is a good action movie, and it is just fun. I also liked ´Armageddon´ and especially ´The Rock´, which were also produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Michael Bay. The story : Markus Burnett ( Martin Lawrence ) and Mike Lowrey ( Will Smith ) are two cops. One day Mike´s wife is killed by a drug dealer. She ´visited´ him with her friend Julie ( Tea Leoni ). So she is the witness and she has to be taken into custody. She just wants to talk to Mike Lowrey, but since he is outta house, Marcus Burnett has to pretend to be Mike Lowrey. Marcus Burnett has a wife, so he brings her to the house of Mike Lowrey, without letting him know that ( at first ). Then he tells him this stuff, and since Tea Leoni thinks that Marcus is Mike, Marcus has to stay in Mike´s house, while Mike spends the nights in Marcus´ house. Julie says Marcus who the killer is, so Marcus and Mike just have to find and kill him. But that is not that simple, and Julie has been abducted by the drug dealers. During a drug party"" Marcus and Mike free Julie and kill the murderer.I think this one is the worst of the three action movies mentioned above, but still good. It is worse than Armageddon and way worse than ´The Rock´, which I consider to be the best action movie after ´Jurassic Park´. But I do not recommend it to guys who do not like provoking action movies, because this one provokes a lot of reactions. All in all, I rated ´Bad Boys´  8/10, because it is a good and fun action movie. But there are definitely better action films. If you have any quetions, feel free to ask them.",Bad Boys
152,TheProteanGirl,Lighthearted and Funny!,9,18 January 2021,"This was a really entertaining movie to watch for me. I found Martin Lawrence so funny and it was overall just a chill movie. Quality wise in the plot is just meh with a lot of action, but funny.",Bad Boys
153,GeorgeSickler,"Sorry Boys, Way Too Bad",3,9 August 2009,"This has to rate somewhere among the 25 worst high-production-value movies of all time. The plot and story line are so weak and poorly developed that a lot of the action doesn't make sense, nor does the dialog and reactions among the actors during the scenes. A lot of the problems they encountered throughout the movie could have been resolved by applying high-school-level common sense. But then the movie would only run for a half-hour or less.Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are supposedly a detective team along the lines of Danny Glover and Mel Gibson in the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, or the spy team of Bill Cosby and Robert Culp in the 1960s ""I Spy"" series.The difference is there is no chemistry between Smith and Lawrence, unless you consider a cocktail of hydrochloric and sulfuric acid ""chemistry."" Their non-stop verbal abuse of each other without comic relief quickly stopped being entertaining and migrated to the tedious and boring. I found myself surfing other channels, but came back because other interesting shows were either in Spanish or German with Spanish sub-titles.Sure, watch the movie for the first time if it's on TV and there's nothing better. It will help if you're of age and have a pitcher of Margueritas or a bottle of wine handy. If not, consider having a root canal that day and be on Codine -- the movie will replace your focus on the pain.",Bad Boys
154,asandor,A goofy action film,5,9 February 2016,"Bad Boys is a film directed by Michael Bay, and stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as two buddy cops. The film revolves around a drug heist from the vaults of a police station, and encompasses a related double murder, that needs to be solved by Mike Lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence). Fortunately for our buddies, one witness, Julie Mott (played by Tea Leoni) survived and will only assist Lowrey in his investigation, for fear of retribution from the criminal gang responsible for the heist and murders.This is a typical '90's action film, with buddy cop comedy, gun fights and explosions, and incomprehensible ""switched identities"" confusion. This film is pretty muddled where the plot is concerned, to say the least. The acting is typical Smith/Lawrence. They are funny and the buddy drama is well done, but it is difficult to take the two seriously, as they are often pursuing a punch line over any criminals. The heroes feel invincible, as they drop one liner after one liner during gunfights and car chases. This isn't always a bad thing, but leaves the viewer craving more of that, and less of the muddled Lowrey/Burnett swapping, or the wife who mistakes the switch for a cover-up affair with Leoni's character. Leoni herself was pretty good, but her character had little to do throughout the film, besides being the maguffin of the film.As you can see above, my opinion on Bad Boys is mixed. It's fun, and good for a laugh or two. The action is solid, if clichéd and a bit dated, but this is no complaint. The story, however, is a befuddled mess. The side characters are useless, and Lowrey and Burnett's buddy cop routine is strained during much of the film, due to incomprehensible identity swapping. The film is fun at times, and trying at others. It's worth a watch because it's fun, but for very little else.",Bad Boys
155,momjessicaandjordan,All Time Classic,10,3 August 2021,Just Martin Lawrence and Will Smith alone makes this movie entertaining. Their chemistry makes this movie acceptable for me.

158,k-dhesi,A fun action comedy. But a little over done.,7,30 May 2009,"Bad boys not doubt was full with loads of laughter and packed with action. The action never really stood out in a way, but it was some very decent shooting scenes. Definitely some scenes were well overdone. But more positives reflect from this movie then negative. It does more then enough to keep you very entertained and connected with what's going on and certainly keeps you laughing! What makes this movie so favoured is for two main reasons.1) The casting was superb and a sure excellent choice. Not one actor/actress was disappointing never the less the script was too superior to the acting, it was not brilliant but very decent and very funny. The now familiar but up coming star in those times, the legendary Will Smith. (mike Lawry) Was as you would expect powerful, funny and himself! Flawless job. Along side him another star. Martin Lawrence (Marcus Burnett) as you would expect too he was very funny and also a delight to watch. A great partnership to watch, them too together were truly historical they offer many many laughs.2) Is just simple. You just don't see many flicks like Bad Boys today. It's funny and action packed. It doesn't really get better then a action/comedy like this. The plot too was a tad original and it lead to a fun adventure.I wouldn't really say negative because this movie was superb. But one thing is for sure, some scenes were a little overdone. Perhaps it was the camera shots or the background music or even the look on the actors faces. The phenomenal director Michael Bay did a magnificent job. After making many minors he stepped up to make his first real movie, with a bigger budget and bigger cast for the big screen. He impressed the world and that is truly reflected on the movie. However some scenes were made too tense, the music in the background or the heat in the actors playing there roles needed to be cut down a little, the tension was to high but the situation is not that big. So yes. Michael Bay or even the movie editors could have cut down some unnecessary ""hype"" But nothing real major.All in all. a great flick and excellently executed by Michael Bay. Although a little over done Bad Boys will leave you laughing thanks too the good humour from Smith and Lawrence. Also leave you satisfied with its decent action. A sensational blockbuster to always be remembered.",Bad Boys
159,nEoFILM,What ya gonna do,8,11 March 2012,"What a surprise, a pleasant one mind, this film was. Michael Bay's first feature and collaboration with the late Don Simpson and the very much alive Jerry Bruckheimer, I've never really been interested in this franchise. But in the effort to complete the Bay cannon, Bad Boys and Bad Boys II are hot on my watch list.This was funny, sharp and reasonably action packed, a real 90′s blockbuster. This was, by today's standards, 'Michael Bay light', or toned down, with much less action than today, but what was there, was classic, with ridiculous explosions, slow motion and magic hour all day!Very enjoyable, with good performances all round, even from Martin Lawrence who I'm not fan of. Looking forward to Bay Boys II and have yet to find a Michael Bay film which I actively dislike.",Bad Boys

Action and comedy are my two favourite genres, so it's no surprise that I like both in the one movie, one of the reasons I loved most of the 'Lethal Weapon' series. (except the first)  Bad Boys is no exception, it is very funny, with a lot of violence and action mixed in.  There is a lot of coarse language, also similar with the 'Lethal Weapon' series (especially No.4), and it is great for a buddy cop movie (which the 'Lethal Weapon's' are too).  So, if you liked this, you're more than likely going to like the 'Lethal Weapon' series. (except the first)",Bad Boys
162,fidelio74,'Just do what you do. Only faster.',6,6 November 2010,"Michael Bay's directorial debut, 'Bad Boys', is so beautiful to look at you could switch off the sound and just luxuriate in the stunning visuals. Bay's camera is rarely still, swooping energetically all over the place. If you are looking for mindless action with plenty of laughs thrown in then you have definitely come to the right place.Martin Lawrence and Will Smith star as two Miami cops who go after a bunch of bad guys who have stolen a huge amount of heroin from the two cops' police station. In the process they must provide witness protection to Julie Mott (Tea Leoni), a young woman who can ID the villains.The bad guy of the piece is Fouchet (Tcheky Karyo), and he is wonderfully sinister in a role quite similar to the one he would later play in the Jet Li martial arts actioner 'Kiss of the Dragon'. But the real treat of 'Bad Boys' is Joe Pantoliano as Captain Howard. Character actor Pantoliano is always likable, except perhaps as Cypher in 'The Matrix'. He takes his role which is pretty thankless - the screaming police chief - and really invests it with wit and charisma.The action scenes are dazzling and competently handled, climaxing with an explosive showdown at an aircraft hangar. On the whole, 'Bad Boys' is pretty forgettable. But it is very entertaining, and will definitely satisfy action fans.",Bad Boys
163,LG72387,"A funny, thoroughly entertaining action comedy",6,7 August 2003,"Bad Boys is a great action comedy from producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. It features Will Smith (in his breakout performance) and Martin Lawrence, an unlikely pair who quite simply are the best movie duo I've seen since Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in Rush Hour. The film features incredible action sequences (i.e. the Ether truck chase scene featuring massive explosions and pervasive gun fights) which all lead up to the film's action-packed climax which could only be done in a Jerry Bruckheimer film. The film also stars Tea Leoni (who is pretty good in playing the damsel in distress), Joe Pantoliano (whom we all know as Ralphie on The Sopranos, as a police captain) and Tcheky Karyo as the villain. (He was also the French officer opposite Mel Gibson in 2000's The Patriot) The movie features comedic one-liners from Smith and Lawrence as well as a few by Leoni. It also features a few sex jokes and just plain ""disses"". However, the characters are so underdeveloped that all we are left with is action and comedy. This formula is also seen in the recent summer blockbuster Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, in which we could care less about the characters and just look for the action. However, Simpson and Bruckheimer's Bad Boys succeeds where T3 does not. By the end of the movie, we care about the heroes because they are fun to watch. In T3, the great Ah-nuld is just a figurehead for a movie romped with action-packed sequences and jaw-dropping stunts. This is one of only three good Michael Bay films (right next to Pearl Harbor and The Rock) and should seen by any action movie fan.

And in my opinion bay deserved a Best director Oscar nomination for thisthe film was also produced by Jerry Bruckheimer one of the most prestigious film producers in Hollywood being responsible for producing some of the best movies of all time that are also the reasons cinema was invented as well as being produced by his then co producing partner don simpson who produced most movies with him before his death and when director Michael bay himself filled him in for producing his next movies with Jerry Bruckheimer like I said they made a great team and it's to bad they don't produce and do movies together anymore this movie is the reason Michael bay is part of cinema he is the superstar of cinema and he is also like i said the reason blockbuster cinema exists,this movie is pure gold it has everything you need to make a great film with a fantastic cast ensemble an amazing direction from Michael bay and awesome chemistry between smith and Lawrence this is also among will smith's best movies Michael bay casted both smith and Lawrence properly and did not waste their talent once he makes it so perfectly that I would just watch this film over and over,I would gladly recommend this to anyone looking for themselves to get entertained cause Michael bay knows how to make a watchable popcorn flickthis is among bay's best films as well as being among the best films Will smith stared in and is the best film Lawrence was in the bad boys franchise would never exist without Michael bay and Michael bay wouldn't exist without it the films are again like i said the reason Michael bay was put in cinema he makes films anything but crap watch it to get yourself in a good mood.

In the other bad boys they labeled him as a wealthy police but didn't say where he got his money from, but in this one he was poor and joined the police and then went and work undercover for some mexican Cartel and fell in love with the wife of the Cartel's boss, so where did he get his money from? Should we assume he was a corrupt police man, who while working undercover for the cartel got very rich?That is how absurd the whole story is. Smith's role was just plain, and Lawrence's was a bit funny but the whole story is just stupid and there is way too much violence with brutal killings and shootings and dismembered innocent people, which seems to be unnecessary.Worst of all in the end they leave the door open for another one in which Smith and his newly found son will be working together.By the way Bad Bunny looks terrible, fat, ugly, untidy, unhealthy, a complete sociopath, just what he probably is in real life.",Bad Boys

The boys get set to handle this case with some very violent and hilarious outcomes.Now this movie has one of the best introduction to the main roles ever.

A type of conversion, where you may fathom that you were just witnessed to one of the most immaculate action packed, adrenaline sense, and light melodramatic films of all time? I incidentally experienced a feeling such as this in the aftermath of seeing this spectacular film. The plot is short and precise, the dialogue crisp and coherent, the acting surprisingly non-superficial and droll and all aspects which constitute to making a film everlastingly stick in your head, is what Bad Boys 1995 is made of. Words cannot begin to describe the sensation that was prevalent to me whilst watching the nonstop action of two vivacious black cops (Martin Lawrence and Will Smith) as they avidly followed in the consummate steps of a scrupulous villain.The saga begins with a brief introduction of the habitual hectic lives of the two protagonists. At first it appears all ""cheerio"" and glamorous but after an overtly callous verbal accost over the telephone the two cops have to get down to business! They speed to their precinct and are privy to the fact that several tones of heroine have been recently purloined by a perspicacious antagonist and his subservient crew. In the midst of their incessant search for the villain (Tchéky Karyo), the life of the most gorgeous ( I've ever seen in my opinion) brunette white woman (Tea Leoni) falls into jeopardy when her best friend is unexpectedly murdered for not divulging critical information. From here on out, the hilarious and unified black cops do everything in their power to pursue justice.On top of a brilliant plot outline, the theme of the soundtrack supplements the tensions in the film in ways that I can't even begin to describe. I mean how brilliant does the sonorous line ""Bad Boys, Bad boys, Whatcha gonna do? Watcha gonna do when they come for you!"" sound when it is placed in a film that is just that! I will candidly acknowledge that this is the greatest film I have ever seen in my entire life (and not only action film, the greatest FILM) and I would highly suggest that you do as well(although such an opinion might be chastised for its naivety due to the fact that I haven't seen many films, at least in comparison to the potato couch nonstop television viewers nowadays..).",Bad Boys

185,Stevieheuge,A kick-ass action ride,8,17 November 2002,"Bad Boys has everything in a buddy-cop movie - the duelling comedy between the two main characters, the angry as hell boss, the pretty lady, the crazy foreign bad guy, blah blah blah, but this film just makes it all work together perfectly. Smith and Lawrence are one of the best and funniest double acts I have ever seen on screen, and that alone is reason enough to give this a watch. Joe Pantoliano is often hilarious as their boss too.
Although more of an action comedy than a serious crime thriller, Michael Bay keeps it serious enough throughout so that the viewer, whilst laughing his ass off, will still pay close attention to what is going on, and actually care what happens, something most action comedies fail to pull off.Bad Boys can also proudly boast of having on of the best finales ever in a movie of its kind, with an explosive shootout in an aircraft hanger. Its easy to see where the budget went here, and it is used to great effect.With never a dull moment and plenty of top notch humour and violence, i give Bad Boys a very solid 8 out of 10.",Bad Boys

I am a HUGE comedy fan, if there's a big comedy, I WILL watch it, and despite the fact that this was not all that funny, I still liked it, and I will go see Bad Boys 2 at some point in time.This IS a movie worth watching, with enough laughs to not annoy you (there's nothing worse than a movie trying to funny and failing).

It's pretty obvious that a number of scenes (Pretty much every scene that's good for a laugh) was ad-libbed, and it's equally obvious that Smith and Lawrence had a great time filming this.Aside from that, the movie is a strictly by-the-number buddy cop-flick with absolutely no surprises that suffers even more because of Michael Bay's seizure-inducing camera techniques.

The plot is not a multi-layered one which critics seem to be demanding all the time theses days but its good and keeps the film on the move. Fans of Lethal weapon and Rush Hour will enjoy this a lot. I just hope they make a third Bad Boys as it has a lot of good potential. If you are a Michael Bay fan than you will know he likes to have a flashy, stylised look about his films (The Island, Bad Boys2) and like all his films, I recommend you see them in Blu-ray to get the most out of these gems.",Bad Boys
192,sonumania123,It is best to say Bad Boys is nothing but a watchable action comedy.,6,30 April 2013,"Michael Bay's Bad Boys is Bay's first feature film and it may probably be his finest film. Unfortunately it's not saying much because Bay happens to prefer the road of over-stuff and senseless rather than clear and capable. The story is simple and easy-going, Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith) are two detectives for the Miami Police Department (MPD), who are called to search a one-hundred millions dollars' worth of heroin that was stolen from a protected vault. The main anti-hero Fouchet (Karyo) plans out the heroin high-jack. Julie (Leoni), the protagonist just happens to be in the wrong place at wrong time, and becomes the key witness for the MPD. It is up Lowrey and Burnett to capture Fouchet and his men, and be sure Julie is in protective custody. Lawrence and Smith did a fine job occupied together as detectives; both men have characters and an understanding that delivers the moving drive to the script. Fouchet in other hand was lame. He was the leading villain, but he didn't seem cool, badass, or even interesting. Through-out the entire film, the guy seemed boring and unexciting. Though Bad Boys was not perfectly completed, but it is best to be said that Bad Boys is entertaining for those who are looking for it. It's no-where near the best example of ludicrous popcorn flick, but the flick does have the viewers that will surely be pleased with the entire film.",Bad Boys
193,james-jones180,Bay before Bay went full Bay,4,20 January 2020,"As one of Bay's earlier entries to his filmography, Bad Boys has fewer of the typical Bayisms, which is both a blessing and a curse. While the action is not excessively over the top, Bay still attempts some stylizing which is a nice way of saying blurry slo-mo. The characters aren't really well written, particularly the female characters who are written solely to annoy the leads. Those leads however are the film's saving grace as Will Smith and Martin Lawrence play off of each other very well and have good comedic chemistry.",Bad Boys

Micheal Bays action is really bland for me. It doesn't age well and is really mediocre. However when we are not focusing on the plot or the gun fights then we get a chemistry that really frustetates me. I really want to be able to enjoy the performances and revisit this film but it is too clutered with everything else that is soo boring. A little fun, kind of like orange juice.

Martin Lawrence and Will Smith have palpable chemistry and are a delight to watch. On the negative side, Michael Bay's affinity for gaudy explosions is back and as egregious as ever - though one can question whether that's truly a negative given the genre off the film.

Luckily for them there is a witness The only problem is the timing as Martin Lawrence is forced to pretend to be his partner Mike Lowery well trying to keep their only witness safe. Joe Pantelione is great as the cliché Sergeant. With great lines and great chemistry Bad Boys is easily the best buddy cop film since lethal weapon.

211,Gerryt22,Michael Bay at his best.,10,20 August 2014,"Bad Boys is just a pure action classic! I am a sucker for buddy cop films and Bad Boys is without a doubt my favorite buddy cop film. It is also the perfect action comedy. It seems as though with action comedies there are two possible things that can happen. You can have a film that has mostly comedy but with some action, though not BIG action like Beverly Hills Cop for example. Or you can have a film with a ton of BIG action yet just have some humorous moments here and there like Die Hard for example. What I always loved about Bad Boys and it's sequel is that it has equal amounts of action and comedy. You can be at the edge of your seat watching an intense action scene then laugh out loud in the next one and so on. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence were perfectly matched for this film. at the time the two were big sitcom stars on TV and have yet to have a break out hit on the big screen. This film was also Michael Bay's directorial debut. This film had a fairly small budget for an action film and what I've always appreciated about this film was how Bay was able to make a fun, entertaining, explosive action film while staying on budget. He even sacrificed part of his salary just so he can film extra action scenes. The point is Bay proved in his debut that he can work with a budget long before his high demands with Transformers. Now Michael Bay these days seems to be a popular magnet for hate and criticism. I feel as though he does NOT deserve the amount of hate he gets. Whenever I hear someone say ""I hate Michael Bay"" I always bring Bad Boys to their attention hoping to prove to the viewer that Bay is talented. Sure, obviously he isn't Spielberg good, but Bay is good enough that people should give him a chance. One things for sure is that even though film analyst, critics, and all sorts of film buffs love to hate Bay, the general audience seem appreciate his works since all of his films have been box office successes. Bay knows what audiences want and gives it to you. What's so bad about seeing a brainless action film every once in awhile?!?! Haters act as if Bay murdered a village filled with children when he does his films. When Bay presses all the right buttons in his directing machine he can make something truly entertaining. Overall this is without a doubt a film I can re watch at least 5 times a month. This and its sequel are not only on my top 10 all time favorite action films but also my top 10 films in general. Love or hate Bay, Bad Boys is his best work. 10/10-Gerry T",Bad Boys

Will Smith is not much better, he tries to be the super cool, charming black hero who can get every woman.The story is all the way predictable, after the first 5 minutes you know how the movie will end. So the story is not exciting, it doesn't astonish the audience, it is just boring and you always can easily guess what will happen next.If you want to watch a senseless action movie better watch XXX because even this crap is better than Bad Boys.

It had been playing on cable about 4 times a day for the last month so I finally decided to watch it.  OH MY GOD!  Why people like Joey Pants, Will Smith and Tea Leoni ever signed up for this piece of trash is beyond me. I hardly know where to begin.First, we all know that movies are shot scene by scene, but rarely is it so apparent as it is with this movie. Note the instantaneous switch from broad daylight to night as Tea climbs the stairs to escape the bad guys before jumping off the roof into the pool. Huh? I don't think even creative editing could have melded these disjointed segments together.The dialogue is so bad that the writer should have been ashamed to put his name in the credits. With the caliber of people in this movie I KNOW they could have add-libbed the entire thing and done a better job.  And when Will and Martin go into their ""spontaneous"" arguments every time they are in trouble it just gets old very fast.The only reason I kept watching beyond the half hour mark is that Tea Leoni looked SO HOT in this movie.  But even that couldn't keep me from pulling the plug after around the 1 hr 15 min mark. I could go on and on but then I'd just be wasting more of my time on this train-wreck of a movie.If you like action/comedy movies and or ""buddy"" movies you'd be better served by walking through that aisle in Blockbuster with your eyes closed and picking one at random.

Smith and Lawrence are really funny and cool together in this stupid but really entertaining and funny actioncomedy. The jokes were often very good and the actionscenes were awesome.

229,joswalt,Just plain good stuff,8,10 April 2000,"I have to be honest.  The first time I saw this movie, it was in a cheap theater, I was not impressed by Will Smith's first excursion into the action foray.  My friend went to see it with me because of Martin Lawrence's ""You So Crazy"" and was anxious to see it.  He liked it more than I did.  I gave it a second chance on VHS when it was released.  I liked it more.  The humor was better and I appreciated the talky tone of the film.  It was different from other action films in this respect.The basic outline is one of a typical action flick.  Bad guys perpetrate a big crime and its up to a buddy team of cops and a beautiful witness to foil the crime in only a few days.  Several things elevate this film to one of the better in the genre.  One is the direction of Michael Bay.  A veteran of music videos, he is no stranger to the quick-cut, breakneck pace that a hip, modern action movie might require.  Another is the chemistry of the two leads.  Smith and Lawrence work together, and play well off of each other. The screenplay by George Gallo, who brought another action film ""Midnight Run"" to new heights, and Michael Barrie is talkier than usual for an action film.  It provides the usual cheesy punchlines here and there, but isn't afraid to stray from the plot a little here and there.  Many critics of well-oiled action flicks see this as a crutch.  I see it as an oppurtunity to get human qualities from the characters to add what realism possible to the script.These aspects of the film earn it an 8 out of 10 from me.  Fans of action comedy will be pleased with the results.  As my friend, an avid action-comedy fan, says:  ""It has everything you could want in a movie: action, guns, explosions, humor, and beautiful women.""  As far as the genre goes, I would have to agree.",Bad Boys
230,jplentini75,A good idea but a terrible script,1,13 August 2001,"I like a good action comedy. I loved Martin in Blue Streak, Big Momma's House, loved Rush Hour, Men in Black, etc. These kinds of comedy's usually are very entertaining and do very well at the box office. I was very disappointed with Bad Boys. The script was horrible. The dialogue was either cliched, strained or cheesy - mostly a bunch of mindless bantering and arguing between Smith and Lawrence that makes you want to fast forward to a good part (but except for some action sequences - their aren't any). The characters were cliched as well, but what was really bad was the plot itself- horribly deficient and full of holes.Near the beginning of the movie, Martin Lawrence's character, Marcus Burnett, has to assume the identity of his partner Mike Lowry (Will Smith's character) in order to protect a witness who saw her best friend murdered by some drug kingpins. Mike Lowry is the only cop she trusts, (and only knows him by name). Marcus arranges to bring her into protective custody, and claims to be Mike who is indisposed at the time. In the process, Marcus saves her life numerous times but yet for some reason doesn't tell her he is really not Mike. Later she meets Mike and the both of them save her lousy hide several more times. She obviously trusts both officers, but they still can't reveal their true identities for whatever reason. She is beautiful but other than that, her character is annoying and if they had just shot her, it would have really helped the film.The two officers get into all sorts of problems attempting to pass of as the other, and the longer the charade goes on the more you realize how little thought went into developing believable characters who react logically with their environment and situations. The film is an insult to anyone's intellect who has more than two brain cells firing.Don't waste your time watching this movie! It's not worth the $2 at Blockbuster.",Bad Boys
231,janderson-97364,T'was a knee slapper,8,30 April 2021,I watched this awhile ago but I wanted to give it some love. I loved the humor in this movie while having it so action packed! Good job boys and gotta watch the next one.,Bad Boys
232,hbk17,My FAVORITE film of ALL-TIME!,10,8 January 2014,"A movie with a sick name with two of my favorite actors Will & Martin, need i say more? This film has to be one of the GREATEST films of all-time . Will & Martin give EXCELLENT performances and the casting is just excellent as well. It has an amazing OST also. If you are a fan of Martin or will, you really need to add this film to your collection. This film had a HUGE influence on my life when i was younger, when Will & Martin are running with their shirts open flying in the wind, i started doing it because it looked so cool. I used to be a hall-monitor in elementary school and because of Bad Boys, i used to chase the other kids down the hall trying to be like Will. This film needs to go in the National Film Museum if there is such a thing.",Bad Boys
233,trvsclark,not bad,7,3 August 2011,"Quite frankly, I'm sick of people endlessly bashing Michael Bay and his movies. His debut here is great for what it wants to be and brings back what was becoming an extinct genre in movies. This takes the buddy cop style and retrofits it with a highly stylized Miami backdrop, never- ending action and great characters. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence work extremely well together and have a great routine of ridiculous arguments and fighting. I like that this already has an established friendship, rather than another unlikely duo scenario. The plot here is great for what is necessary; an evil French mastermind trying to pull a fast one on Miami PD. When it comes to beautiful looking movies, you definitely can't even attempt to criticize Michael Bay. His talent in that area is obviously. Also, no one knows how to blow things up and cause mayhem and destruction like the mad scientist he is. While he might make movies that critics hate and oversimplify, I think it's obvious that he's a very talented director that knows exactly what he wants to do. Bad Boys delivers on every level for a buddy cop movie. It knows how to be genuinely funny, serious and action packed. I realize that there are those who just have an instantaneous hate for all things Michael Bay, but it's really no excuse to make Bad Boys out to be anything other than a great Buddy Cop action extravaganza. It's really fun to watch this every few years and remember what makes it so much fun.",Bad Boys

235,igorashu,The Bay of bud,7,14 July 2017,"Bad Boys is a great action comedy from producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. It features Will Smith (in his breakout performance) and Martin Lawrence, an unlikely pair who quite simply are the best movie duo I've seen since Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in Rush Hour. The film features incredible action sequences (i.e. the Ether truck chase scene featuring massive explosions and pervasive gun fights) which all lead up to the film's action-packed climax which could only be done in a Jerry Bruckheimer film. The film also stars Tea Leoni (who is pretty good in playing the damsel in distress), Joe Pantoliano (whom we all know as Ralphie on The Sopranos, as a police captain) and Tcheky Karyo as the villain. (He was also the French officer opposite Mel Gibson in 2000's The Patriot) The movie features comedic one-liners from Smith and Lawrence as well as a few by Leoni. It also features a few sex jokes and just plain ""disses"". However, the characters are so underdeveloped that all we are left with is action and comedy. This formula is also seen in the recent summer blockbuster Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, in which we could care less about the characters and just look for the action. However, Simpson and Bruckheimer's Bad Boys succeeds where T3 does not. By the end of the movie, we care about the heroes because they are fun to watch. In T3, the great Ah-nuld is just a figurehead for a movie romped with action-packed sequences and jaw-dropping stunts. This is one of only three good Michael Bay films (right next to Pearl Harbor and The Rock) and should seen by any action movie fan.",Bad Boys
236,hannischristian,A fun start to the Career of Michael Bay,10,9 August 2020,Michael bay is the best action director today. I had a great time watching his first film. This film builds really well. I had a fun time watching it. God Bless Michael Bay!,Bad Boys
237,K&M,"Action, Humor, Guns, Girl.. what more?",9,19 February 1999,This is a fantastic movie.. I have developed an appreciation of the Simpson/Bruckheimer style ever since Top Gun.. but this movie takes the cake.. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence work so well with each other and Tea.. well what more needs to be said!! This is a classic and epitomises the production style of Simpson/Bruckheimer and this is the same style continued by Bruckheimer in Enemy of the State.. do yourself a favour see anything these guys produce!,Bad Boys
238,herks,This movie is the Bomb!!!!!!!!!,10,14 January 1999,"This movie brings together two of the funniest comediens around in an big budget, big thrill, big action packed spectacular. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence click together with their offbeat humour which is backed up nicely by Tea Leoni. This movie has it all, fast cars, sexy women, comedy, chases, and some great explosions! Do yourself a favour,  GET THIS MOVIE!!!!!! !",Bad Boys
239,Zooba_Ms,"a Kick ass, VERY funny, action movie",10,14 July 1999,"This is one of the funniest action movie ever made. You can see the magnificent chemistry between Martin and Will, I believe they really enjoyed making this movie. The combination of the excellent producers- Don Simpson & Jerry Brukhiemer and the great action director Michael Bay- made this movie not only funny, but packed with high speed cat chases, and numerous gun fights, that just looks great. All of my friends saw it at least twice. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",Bad Boys
240,Hastaman,Great all around movie.,7,2 March 1999,"This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The action scenes themselves are a treat to watch. This film along with The Rock are what make me believe that Michael Bay will become one of the best action directors ever. The movie is a crack up too, it's hilarious. The whole score is fantastic done by Mark Mancina, which I believe brings this movie to a higher level of excellence. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are great together, although I enjoy watching Lawrence the most by far.  If you haven't seen this movie, go now!",Bad Boys
241,robgreen,Excellent!!!!,9,17 July 1999,"bad boys is one of the best action flicks which struggles with the story line, but what it lacks in plot it makes up admirably with quick fire humor, impressive action and special effects. A good all-rounder.",Bad Boys
242,georgsimic,It is one of the best Action movies,10,2 January 2000,"Bad Boys is one of the best Action-Comedies ever made. It is of course a typical Buddy-Movie and a typical loud Action firework. But it has lots of fun in it! That comes from the actors, whose are good comedians. Especially Martin Lawrence-who has the funnier part- made his work very good. The explosions and shoot outs are perfect styled. This was excellent filmed by Michael Bay, which was his debut! But now he is one of the best director for Action movies. And this movie is it too - one of the best Action movies! It is not only the action, it is the fun.",Bad Boys
243,mjordanj2309,Bad Boys Rules,10,24 April 2000,"Will Smith and Martin Lawrence play extremely well opposite each other.  The one drawback, and this was the only one, is that Tea Leoni had an annoying voice.  The plot of Bad Boys has been knocked, but name me a true action movie that actually has a plot?  No one goes for the plot, just to see things blow up.  I definitely recommend that everyone who reads this go to the local movie store and rent this movie.  Besides Tupac is on the soundtrack and that makes this movie even better.",Bad Boys

245,graceemilygibson,I absolutely love this film,10,16 July 2020,"Bad boys is probably one of the best action/comedy films i've ever watched. The chemistry between Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) is brilliant. They're quite the comedic duo, but when it comes to the action, they are badass. This duo is absolutely perfect. Films like this are rare to find nowadays, so i'd definitely recommend watching it! Can not wait to watch Bad Boys 2 as well as Bad Boys for Life!",Bad Boys

247,DaVeHetesi,Bad Boys movie is underrated !!!,9,12 June 2009,"You people are IDIOTS !""Bad Boys"" movies are classically ,everyone knows how good are these films. I think IMDb users are absolutely underrated this movie. This film has a very good technically ,effects ,actions ,story ,actors... and not at all a very-very good director ,MICHAEL BAY. Look at the release date ,it's 1995 !!!....In 1995 ,bad boys movie wasn't just a film ,and wasn't just a good action movie. In 1995 that movie was the great breakthrough of todays action movies. The directors ,the actors are done a very good job ,I think Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are the best pair to make this film successful. Everything in this movie is so GOOD.... And in the end look at the numbers ,They spent 19,000,000 $ to make this fantastic movie ,and in the of the premiers they gross more than 7x profit !!!....but the accurate number is 141,407,024 $ !!! And look at this movie is exciting ,it's funny ,and one of the most enjoyable movies...I hope you agree with my opinion.",Bad Boys

250,Sublimaze,"Ultra-stylish, intense action movie",10,10 July 2003,"Bad Boys is one of my favorite movies of all time.  This movie oozes style. Stylish good guys battle stylish bad guys in the stylish, sizzling city of Miami. I just can't say enough good things about Bad Boys.This is a film that works on many levels.  Before Bruckheimer and Michael Bay became famous and lazy and made disappointing flicks (think Pearl Harbor and Armageddon), they made excellent movies like The Rock and Bad Boys. First off, directing is top notch.  From the get-go, this movie moves along at a furious pace, and Bay's trademark slow-motion, close-up sequences are amazing.Will Smith and Martin Lawrence give first-rate performances as the supercool Miami Narc good guys.  The villain Fouchet is also well-played by Karyo. Of course, there is the beautiful Tea Leoni.  The assortment of smaller characters like Sanchez and Ruiz, Jojo, the Captain, and the goons add flavor to many scenes.  Everyone is just so cool and stylish.  I love Jojo the tire-man!Action sequences are some of the BEST ever filmed.  The lobby shootout, Club Hell, and all the others.  Even the soundtrack in this movie is awesome. Mancina's score fits this movie like a glove.  And in between the action, there is hilarious humor and some quite moving emotional scenes. As for style...just watch.  Miami, Miami Beach, Lowrey's black Porsche, the clothes, the bad guys, the women...its all there.I could go on and on about every single thing that is so great about Bad Boys, but I will stop here and invite all the action junkies out there to definitely see this!I give this movie 10/10.  Action does not get any more stylish and cool than this.",Bad Boys
251,lemoncandy,"if u have time to kill, find better ways of doing it than watching this...",1,15 February 2004,"I started watching Hollywood movies 6 years back, watched some of the greatest classics and blockbusters of all times. Was amazed and awestruck that how was Hollywood capable of churning out such amazing stuff with such amazing consistency...but after seeing ""Bad boys"" and a few other disappointing movies, I realized that Hollywood too, wasn't perfect. Coming to the movie, the plot was an oft repeated one of two cops pairing up, both different in personas (infact diametrically opposite), and still great pals, one has a wife and kids and other is single and hot, the usual clichés. But that's not all that is bad about the movie..., there is more-the silly dialogues, lousy work by the lead pair, the female lead has no clue what to say or do, she often keeps mumbling and muttering in the background. Above all, the scenes are illogical and can't be attributed to be the actions of sane people. Martin Lawrence does ok in his role, but maybe he could have done better if he hadn't tried to fake that dialogue delivery style which looked very irritating and totally lacking in humor. Comic timing and wisecracks have to be differentiated from silly mannerisms, and this movie is a big example of that. Will Smith, is a little more subdued...but isn't able to emote much or come up with funny stuff. Téa Leoni has no role in the movie, she acts in the craziest, most insensible ways, invites trouble each time(if it was real life, she would have been killed the first time she tried to pull off those stupid stunts of hers), not to mention the male leads who too are guilty of this!!! The wife too is shown as an irrational human being who would make unjustified demands on his apparently busy husband. The movie is about the most irrational and stupid people we are ever going to come across. They do all sorts of crazy and suicidal things at the silliest pretext and dumbest logic!!! I hope there are no people of such kind anywhere in the universe. About the director, he must realize that a movie can be comic even though it has intelligent people in it, everything doesn't have to be so dumb. Besides, showing African Americans in such clichéd roles just tarnishes their image. THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THE MOVIE is the action scenes, and occasional good comedy. So, my advice is, if u have better things to do in life, don't watch it. If u really have to watch a movie, then rent some old favorite rather than go for it. GOD SAVE YOU.",Bad Boys

254,mayormal-1,I worked on Bad Boys 1,9,24 October 2005,"I was the stand in for Vic Manni (Ferguson). Bad Boys was an awesome film to work on because I really got to see the pros at work. Man when I think how huge Michael Bay is now and that was his first feature. I remember when I said bye to him at the wrap party I said ""Good luck"" and he said, ""Thanks, Ill need it."" I also got to do some precision driving. I drove one of the black Suburbans in the final chase scene. Ken Bates, the legendary Hollywood stuntman directed it. What a guy. he was awesome, totally friendly and full of great stories about the stunt business. I think he won an Oscar for the rocket sled he designed for the tunnels. Barry Waldman the producer of Domino was the second unit producer. Another real nice dude with a good sense of humor. I even attended the premiere and after party in L.A. Will Smith was real nice too. After all I'm a homeboy from Philly. I never really spoke with Bruckheimer or Simpson, but i could tell they were total pros. After all they'd already done Bev Hills Cop and Top Gun. One of the coolest locations was the legendary Biltmore Hotel former home of Al Capone. That place is incredible. It was so cool watching the stunt guys scurrying on top of those high Spanish tile roofs shooting machine guns. One of the actors i got friendly with was Tchecky Karyo the French actor. He starred in La Femme Nikita, one of my all time fa-vs. Hes not a bad guitarist either. Always strummed an acoustic on set.
