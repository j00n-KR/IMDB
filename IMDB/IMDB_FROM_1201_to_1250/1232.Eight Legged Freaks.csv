0,Leofwine_draca,Effects-packed B-movie with dumb humour and well-staged action,6,7 July 2016,"With the accent on tongue-in-cheek humour, movie references and in-jokes, this clichéd outing in cinematic excess is a good example of a modern B-movie that gets by on special effects alone more than anything else. The story certainly isn't anything special, managing to incorporate about every modern cliché in the book, whether it be the ""toxic drum falling off a truck"" scene, the ""holed up in a café with chaos reigning outside"" spectacle or the oh-so-predictable explosive climax (the minute you hear one character early on say ""the mine is filled with methane gas"" you just know the whole thing is gonna blow), the surprise level is minimal. Even worse are the movie in-jokes which are dumb beyond belief, consisting of a parrot who says ""I see dead people"" to a guy who says ""It's a spider, man"", although astonishingly these got laughs from fellow audience members at the cinema I visited.The comedy consists of dumb gross-out jokes (somewhat overworked lately in the comedy genre) involving characters wetting themselves and some surprisingly mean-spirited shots of family pets being butchered by the hungry arachnids - although the cat-in-the-wall scene is quite imaginative I wasn't sure that I should have been laughing along with it. Along with the derivative script, there are some rum casting decisions, especially the choice of David Arquette (SCREAM) in the leading role - is it me or does this guy give the exact same performance every film he acts in? At least Arquette is bearable in comparison to Doug E Doug's Eddie-Murphy-wannabe DJ, all shouty and sweary and not at all clichéd. Kari Wuhrer and Scarlett Johansson provide pretty faces but average performances as the females in trouble, with only Scott Terra impressing with his performance of the knowledgeable kid with a fascination for spiders. Horror fans, keep your eyes peeled for MANHUNTER's Tom Noonan as the first victim and a hilarious scene involving a cameoing Jason Vorhees taking a chainsaw to the spiders! The action - which consists of about 70% of this movie - is thankfully pretty good, always fast paced and not too repetitive. The spiders themselves are almost entirely created with CGI, which is not that bad a thing anymore considering the recent improvements in special effects. At least we now have the creatures looking realistic every now and then instead of just looking like the colourful animations of a few years ago. Scenes in which the town swarms with hundreds of arachnids, the giant spider mother chasing the dirt bike through the mine, or the hairy tarantulas wreaking havoc in general are quite exciting and fun to watch, although my money's on the oil tanker explosion as the film's best moment. Fans looking for turn-off-the-brain-style pure entertainment, goo, gristle and action may find this to their liking; I enjoyed it for what it's worth, although I have no plans to watch it again any time soon.",Eight Legged Freaks
1,SnoopyStyle,Fun campy B-movie,7,14 October 2013,"Toxic waste lands in the reservoir of Prosperity, Arizona. An exotic spider farmer collects crickets for his spiders, and his spiders grow to enormous size. The townspeople are overrun by the giant spiders, and rallies around mining engineer Chris McCormack (David Arquette), funny paranoid Harlan (Doug E. Doug), sheriff Sam Parker (Kari Wuhrer), her kids Mike (Scott Terra) and Ashley (Scarlett Johansson).This is a great example of well made creature feature B-movie. The characters are likable and fun. The action is ridiculous and campy. The story is well structure, but it's the actors that we love to root for. It's a movie where there isn't a higher calling than to have a little gleeful fun battling giant spiders.",Eight Legged Freaks
2,Prismark10,Spiders unleashed,5,21 July 2015,"Eight Legged Freaks wants to be old fashioned B movie with broad acting, some comedy and scares, gooey effects and hopefully remind you of the early 1990s horror comedy Tremors.A barrel of toxic waste leaks into a lake in Arizona which causes spiders to grow at an alarming rate who get hungry and set about attacking the local town. Just be grateful that the toxic waste did not give rise to Zombeavers.The female local sheriff (Kari Wuhrer) and Chris McCormack (David Arquette) a bad boy who has returned home after some years lead the town's fight back. Arquette does well as the goofy hero like the type he played in the Scream films, just about likable enough and gets a romance subplot with the sheriff. Scarlett Johansson plays the sheriff's headstrong teenage daughter. Doug E Doug plays the local conspiracy nut. The wealthy town mayor is the bad guy.The finale at the mall goes on for too long as the entire town throws everything at the giant spiders. The film is fun and goofy enough, not really scary but also not memorable. A fast food snack that you will forget about the next day. Maybe because it cynically was a corporate attempt to be a monster B movie and lacked heart.",Eight Legged Freaks
3,nogodnomasters,They never believe the kid,10,10 February 2018,"This is a fun horror movie for the cliche filled genre. The film opens with a spoof of ""AM Coast to Coast."" The town of Prosperity is broke. The local mayor and emu entrepreneur (Leon Rippy) has allowed the abandoned mines under his town to be used as a toxic waste dump. When one of the proverbial poorly packaged drums of waste spills, this results in huge spiders who attack the local community in leaps and bounds.David Arquette and love interest Kari Wuhrer lead the attack against the spiders. This is a young Scarlett Johansson film as she plays the teen daughter. It reminded me of Jennifer Aniston in ""Leprechaun"" or Sandra Bullock in a Roger Corman film. They all start at the bottom. Scott Terra plays a young Harry Potter looking kid that no one believes.The spider special effects was fairly decent. My one criticism is that spiders of different species do not band together and hunt in packs. They would eat each other. Humor, action, and cartoonish horror. The spider noises and sound track go counter to a true horror film.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Some PG-13 words and minor sex talk/situations.",Eight Legged Freaks
4,kosmasp,Attack of the spiders,7,15 September 2010,"Or as the original title said ""Arac Attack"". Why did they change it? It seems the production company got cold feet, because the title was too close/similar to something completely different (""Arac"" sounding a bit like ""Iraq"" it seems). But apart from that little trivia fact (which shouldn't make you think this movie is political or anything serious for that matter), the movie can be a whole lotta fun. Not a movie that will make the top 10 list of many people mind you, but something you can watch to have a good time.The movie knows where it comes from and pays tribute/homage to the early monster/animal movies that paved the way for this movie. It is apparent by quite a few story tweaks and twists, what it means and tries to achieve. Just put in the disc, press play, get a few friends over and have a good time. If you are into such things that is.",Eight Legged Freaks
5,gavin6942,Some Poor Effects,6,30 October 2017,"Venomous spiders get exposed to a noxious chemical that causes them to grow to monumental proportions.What separates this film from some of the lowest-budget science fiction films out there is the cast. The effects are not really any better than the films shown on SyFy, but the talent in the cast brings this up a notch from crud to minor cult classic. The inclusion of Scarlett Johansson right before she got big helps, too.Having David Arquette as the leading man is an interesting choice. Arquette is fun, quirky and does a great job as comic relief. We rarely see him carry a movie. But, to be honest, he did a fairly good job here. The cover tries to play up his goofiness, but he is actually very much the ""straight guy"" here.",Eight Legged Freaks
6,jboothmillard,Eight Legged Freaks,4,13 July 2005,"If you have a fear of spiders, aka arachnophobia, this probably isn't a film for you, but on the other hand, it adds to the feel of the film. Basically a chemical barrel falls from a moving truck, and contaminates the water which is right next to a shop selling many breeds of big spiders, and obviously they are all mutated. When they escape, it is up to Chris McCormick (Scream's David Arquette) and Sheriff Samantha Parker (Kari Wuhrer) to warn people and get them all in the mall where strong walls and weapons can hold these giant, some poisonous and all aggressive, arachnids back. Also starring young Scarlett Johansson as Ashley Parker, Scott Terra as Mike Parker, Doug E. Doug as Harlan Griffith, Rick Overton as Deputy Pete Willis, Leon Rippy as Wade, Matt Czuchry as Bret, Jay Arlen Jones as Leon, Eileen Ryan as Gladys and Last Action Hero's Tom Noonan as Joshua Taft. The special effects are quite cool, there are some deliberate amusing moments, and the B-movie feel actually helps, I judged this too harshly the first time, I used to think it was rubbish, now I think it is alright. Okay!",Eight Legged Freaks
7,ccthemovieman-1,I'm Shocked This Turned Out So Good!,8,1 August 2006,"The only way I gave this a look was that someone loaned it to me for free. I now own it! This looked like it would be a stupid movie, and it some scenes it certainly was, but it was so entertaining that I know I will watch this a number of times.This is a 1950s-type sci-fi flick with modern-day special effects. In fact, if you liked ""Them!"" you'll get a big kick of out of this film. The difference is the much- better special-effects but some low-grade attitudes and some profanity. The characters are dumb but they were dumb in the '50s, too.The story starts off a bit slow but once the overgrown spiders emerge, the film goes full bore and gets extremely entertaining. It's almost too much action. One needs a break! By the end, you're glad it's over. Thus, if they had chopped 5-10 minutes off this, it would have been much better. Nonetheless, it's a fun ride with some genuinely scary parts and some humor, too. Since ""entertainment"" is the name of the game, this gets 8 stars even though it's lower-grade material.It flat-out entertains.",Eight Legged Freaks
8,ma-cortes,"A monster film plenty of spectacular scenes , frenetic action and humor",6,23 May 2010,"It's a monster movie' s homage with gigantic spiders as protagonists . A truck transporting waste crashes and dropping an unfortunate chemical spill in a river . Some spiders are accidentally escaped and the eight-legged beasts increase their weight and wreak havoc , terrorizing and destroying the villagers . Residents of a rural mining town called Prosperity discover that a radioactive stuff has caused hundreds of little spiders to mutate to a giant size . It's then up to mining engineer Chris McCormack (David Arquette)and Sheriff Sam Parker (Kari Wuhrer) to mobilize a diverse group of townspeople , including the Sheriff's young son, Mike (Scott Terra ), her daughter, Ashley (Scarlett Johansson), and paranoid radio-speaker man named Harlan ( Doug E. Doug), into fight against the lethal eight-legged Aracs. Meanwhile the bloodthirsty spiders meet up local citizens and spontaneously catch them and begins to consume people. The spiders rapidly multiplies and the protagonists confronting with them . The eclectic bunch takes refuge at the Prosperity Mall and the little town is devastated by the spiders attack.This monster/comedy film with quite budget packs thrills, some good action and funny moments. It's a hybrid of monster movies from the 50s such as 'Tarantula' and modern American production plenty of C.G.I. The thrilling screenplay is a bit yawn-inspiring but nifty special effects will keep you from dozing off, with nice creatures designers, created by means of Animatronics and computer visual effects . This is a suspenseful and amusing thriller especially at the amazing ending tableau when Lewis Arquette and Kari Wuhrer have to tackle the gigantic spider at the lair in the final. The flick is lavishly produced by Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin. Emmerich is a good director, writer and producer who founded along with Dean Devlin the company Centropolis Entertainment and expert on making movies for the masses and specialist on large-scale disaster movies ¨Day after tomorrow¨, ¨ 2012 ¨, spectacular stories ¨ Stargate ¨,¨ The patriot¨, ¨Universal soldier ¨ and giant monsters as Mammoth and Sabretooth in ¨10.000 B.c ¨ , aliens in ¨Independence day ¨ , ¨Godzilla¨ and spiders in ¨Eight legged freaks¨. The picture is well directed by Ellory Elkayem with rather too much camera movement and there are also lots of low-angle shots of people hanging around waiting to get bitten by the carnivorous spider. Although nothing which haven't been seen before, this is not the picture to watch if you are scared of spiders , however the movie is quite entertaining. Utterly arachnophobia people must flee this film.Other movies about those bugs are the following : ¨Tarantula(1955)¨ by Jack Arnold with John Agar; ¨Tarantula: the deadly cargo(1977)¨ with Claude Akins; ¨Kingdom of spiders(77)¨ by John Budd Cardos with William Shatner and ¨Arachnophobia(1990)¨ by Frank Marshall with John Goodman.",Eight Legged Freaks
9,BA_Harrison,I rate Eight Legged Freaks a freakin' fun eight out of ten.,8,25 April 2008,"As anyone who regularly watches big-bug movies should know, toxic waste and creepy-crawlies are not a great combination, the result usually being monstrous, over-sized critters intent on devouring humans and trashing cities. Eight Legged Freaks is no exception, and opens with a barrel of radioactive goop leaking into a pond near the seemingly-soon-to-be-ghost-town of Prosperity (why do they always tempt fate by giving these places such silly names?); before you know it, giant spiders are everywhere, wrapping up victims and taking them into their arachnoid lardera network of disused gold mines.David Arquette plays Chris McCormick, owner of the mines, who teams up with various townsfolk who have managed to avoid becoming spider fodderincluding sexy Sheriff Samantha Parker (Kari Wuhrer), her equally sexy daughter Ashley (Scarlett Johansson) and geeky son Mike (Scott Terra), and conspiracy theory nut Harlan (Doug E. Doug)to destroy the gigantic spiders and save the town.With a likable cast and a whole slew of impressive special effects, Eight Legged Freaks is an affectionate tribute to the B-movie monsterfests of the 50s. Planting tongue firmly in cheek, writer/director Ellory Elkayem delivers an action packed, thrill-a-minute movie that will have arachnophobes squirming in their seats, whilst everyone else will be having a blast.Occasionally, the film's comedic elements veer towards the cartoonish a tad too much (the spiders make unnecessarily silly noises, do pratfalls, and in one silly scene, even have a wrestling match with a cat inside a dry-lined wall cavity), but, on the whole, the film is a great mix of the silly and the scary.I enjoyed Eight Legged Freaks very much (not least because Wuhrer and Johansson are perhaps the fittest mother/daughter combo ever to grace the silver screen) and highly recommend it if you're after a fun popcorn flick for a Saturday night.",Eight Legged Freaks
10,paul_haakonsen,Creature feature with a comedy twist...,5,9 January 2016,"Despite the really bizarre and misplaced attempt at humor that director Ellory Elkayem opted for ""Eight Legged Freaks"", then this 2002 movie is still worth watching if you enjoy a monstrous creature feature.The story, in all its simplicity, is about a small town that become the hunting grounds for huge, aggressive spiders.While this movie doesn't instill any academy award winning moments, then people still managed to do good jobs with their given roles and characters. Most memorable was Doug E. Doug as the eccentric Harlan Griffith.The spiders in ""Eight Legged Freaks"" were actually quite nicely animated and did look like real arachnids. Well, aside from the sounds they made at times, which were epic fails at bringing comedy into the movie. It was a shame, because this actually dragged the movie down into a mediocre experience.Yes, there are far better spider movies available, but I do think that if you enjoy such movies then ""Eight Legged Freaks"" is still worth sitting down to watch, just tune out the ridiculous sounds that were added to the spiders in many scenes.",Eight Legged Freaks
11,Coventry,Arachnocomedy!,6,18 March 2004,"You could either be really harsh and say the film is a stupid and completely unnecessary CGI-playground or.you could sit back, relax and search for all the adorable references towards the delightful monster-movies like they could only make them in the 50's. In fact, that's all Eight Legged Freaks represents! A spoof slash tribute, updated with the latest and most expensive computer techniques. All the typical cliché aspects are there: the isolated little town with the ironic sounding name, the unfortunate hero and all the charming (slightly retarded) redneck town-inhabitants. And of course the giant, mutated spiders complete with ludicrous yummy-noises. The ways these spiders are hunting they preys is funny instead of scary with complete over-the-top situations. You should already be warneda film that stars David Arquette as the heroic savior can't be taken too seriously. Present in Eight Legged Freaks as well: two generations of stunningly beautiful actresses. Kari Wuhrer and Scarlet Johanssen. The latter is working her way up to the highest regions of Hollywood these days through starring in Oscar-favorites like Lost in Translation' and The Girl with the Pearl Earring', whereas Wuhrer is fixing her career as a B-movie queen. After Eight Legged Freaks, she starred in (mediocre) films such as King of the Ants, The Hitcher II and another Hellraiser sequel. I shamelessly admit I had a great time while watching Eight Legged Freaks. It reminded me of Tremors' a biteven though that one is better. Nonetheless, it's fun and a nice change from all those irrelevant and dull teen-slashers. If you're looking for a real tribute to the 50's monsters, check out the short film `Larger than Life' by the same director. That little film really breathes the monster atmosphere and formed the inspiration (and budget) to shoot Eight Legged Freaks.",Eight Legged Freaks
12,michaelRokeefe,Freakin' spiders run amok.,4,7 August 2003,"With David Arquette starring you would immediately think this to be a stupid movie. Well, it is a stupid movie with a horrid script. But the F/X, namely the eight legged freaks, makes this flick a hoot to watch. A tribute, albeit on the silly side, to those great mutant creature features of the 50s. Arquette and Sheriff Sam(Kari Wuhrer)summon help in fighting off the toxic waste induced giant spiders wreaking havoc on their tiny town in Arizona. Also in the cast are Doug E. Doug, Rick Overton, Leon Rippy and the charming Scarlett Johansson.",Eight Legged Freaks
13,sunwarrior13,Mildly Amusing,8,25 September 2012,"Eight Legged Freaks is a comedy horror that stars David Arquette, Kari Wührer and Scott Terra. The plot concerns a collection of spiders that are exposed to toxic waste, causing them to grow to gigantic proportions and begin killing and harvesting. Chris McCormick is the son of a deceased mine owner, returning home to the economically depressed hamlet of Prosperity, AZ, after a long absence. His arrival coincides with a toxic waste accident in the local water supply, the result of a barrel jostled loose from the back of a passing truck. Unfortunately, said water source abuts the region's least-popular attraction: an exotic spider farm. The farm's owner,Joshua Taft becomes the first victim when the spiders, already possessed of keen predatory abilities, grow to the size of small automobiles. Laying in wait underground, they begin picking off the town's pet and ostrich population, and soon it's all the local sheriff,Sam Parker can do to raise the alarm before the siege begins.In the grand tradition of atomic-age monster movies, this movie delivers everything you'd want from a giant-spider thriller. The plot's hardly original, but familiarity is half the fun, beginning when toxic waste results in a stampede of gigantic, ravenous arachnids in the depressed mining town.Though not quite witty,it offers a deft balance of creepy shocks, sight gags, and tongue-in-cheek satire. And it is mildly amusing as well.",Eight Legged Freaks
14,hitchcockthelegend,Arach Attack!,7,12 June 2009,"Spiders escape from a spider farm in Prosperity, Arizona, and become giant man eating beasts on account of toxic waste accidentally dumped in a near by river. Can the odd ball inhabitants of this Arizona town escape with their lives? Or will spiders rule the earth and lay waste to man kind?Eight Legged Freaks is unashamedly homaging ""B"" movie creature features from the 1950s. The likes of Tarantula and Them! have their Pedipalps well and truly watered, in what is possibly the most undervalued of all the modern day creature feature homages. Having no pretensions what so ever, the only real thing not in ""Freaks"" favour is the usage of CGI, but even that doesn't hurt the film, if anything it adds to the obvious preposterous nature of the genre. I mean how else are we to get 20 foot jumping spiders chowing down on some annoying teenager?Perhaps ""Freaks"" is viewed harsh because the cast is relatively ""C"" list? Again that is a genre staple, surely? For what it's worth I think they do real fine, David Arquette has oodles of goofy charisma, Kari Wuher makes a fine female ass kicker, and the kids (one a young Scarlett Johansen) are really rather cool. Director Ellory Elkayem, who after doing They Nest in 2000 clearly has bug issues, adheres to genre staples. Kooky western town out in the desert, the inhabitants of which range from near loonies to dopey politicians, and the plot follows the traditional sense of impending doom played for laughs. Listen out for the score from John Ottman, which plays on variants of ""Itsy Bitsy Spider"", whilst cast a keen eye on John S. Bartley's Arizona camera work.Whilst not having the savvy scripting of homage daddy, Tremors, or the star appeal of 1990's Arachnophobia, Eight Legged Freaks deserves its place amongst such fun and creepy company. As the tag line says, ""Do you hate spiders? Do you really hate spiders? Well they don't like you either.""With that, I think it's web well and truly spun, don't you? 7/10",Eight Legged Freaks
15,Hey_Sweden,Let the squashing begin!,7,22 January 2018,"A runaway barrel of toxic waste lands in a rural body of water, contaminating the local crickets that are used as food for the residents of a nearby spider farm. Naturally, the 200 or so exotic arachnids grow to mammoth proportions and attack the terrified townspeople en masse. A former resident, Chris McCormick (David Arquette, the ""Scream"" series), has returned home, just in time to help Sheriff Samantha Parker (Kari Wuhrer, ""Anaconda""), the romantic idol of his life, and various other citizens combat the eight legged monsters.""Eight Legged Freaks"" turned out about as good as one could hope for, given that it's treading rather familiar ground. But it does do its job, which is both spoofing and paying homage to its influences, namely 1950s ""giant creepy-crawly"" cinema such as ""Tarantula"" and ""Them!"" (The latter is briefly shown playing on TV.) While it's not in the same league as ""Tremors"", it still serves up an agreeable dose of PG-13 rated horror along with comedy. Also offering up echoes of ""Gremlins"" and ""Aliens"", it makes its fearsome CGI beasts pretty funny themselves by giving them cartoonish vocalizations (supplied by the legendary voice-over artist Frank Welker). Yes, the beasts are digitally rendered most of the time, but some of the animation is pretty decent.Co-writer and debuting director Ellory Elkayem gives his movie great pace and great energy, and keeps things interesting by offing quite a few of the more expendable characters. Pets are also fair game.The typically amusing Arquette dials down his particular brand of goofy eccentricity a bit in order to play a more conventional sort of hero, and he does an alright job. Wuhrer kicks lots of spider ass, and looks damn fine doing it; she has to be one of the sexiest ever small town sheriffs seen in film. Scott Terra (""Daredevil"") is Wuhrers' egghead son, the character whom we know will grasp the situation early on, and Scarlett Johansson (""Don Jon"") is her somewhat sassy teenage daughter. Doug E. Doug (""Cool Runnings"") has his moments as a paranoid local radio DJ. Comedian Rick Overton (""Groundhog Day"") is a hoot as Wuhrers' fumbling, Barney Fyfe-style deputy, Eileen Ryan (""Feast"") is endearing as Arquette's aunt, and the great character actor Leon Rippy ('Deadwood') is effectively slimy as the crooked mayor / entrepreneur. Tom Noonan (""Manhunter"") appears unbilled as the spider farm owner / operator.""Eight Legged Freaks"" will be too overly silly and juvenile for some tastes, but it's quite endearing overall, and impossible to dislike.Seven out of 10.",Eight Legged Freaks
16,poolandrews,Fun with great CGI effects but slightly lacking.,7,8 May 2009,"Eight Legged Freaks is set in the small Arizona town of Prosperity where a lorry transporting barrels of toxic waste sheds one of the barrels which ends in in a pond. Joshua (Tom Noonan) runs a spider farm t which he keeps & breeds various types of spider, he also collects crickets for the spiders to eat near the pond where the toxic waste barrel fell. Somehow the crickets have become contaminated with the toxic waste which in turn gets into the spiders when they eat them, soon Joshua notices that spiders are growing at an alarming rate. Soon the assortment of spiders break out of their tanks & head into the nearby abandoned mines where all the toxic waste was being dumped, soon the spiders are huge & the population of Posperity have to fight for their lives as these spiders get hungry, it's up to Sheriff Parker (Kari Wuhrer) & former resident Chris McCormick (David Arquette) to stop the rampaging spiders...This Australian American co-production was co-written & directed by Ellory Elkayem & according to the IMDb (never the most reliable source of information to be fair...) was written & shot under the title Arac Attack until David Arquette ad-libbed the 'eight legged freaks' line & that was chosen as the new title although it was released in certain European countries as Arac Attack & the Japanese title apparently translates as Spider Panic! which is a crap title whichever way you look at it. Anyway, under whatever title this is a fun little comedy horror flick that pays homage & takes inspiration from the giant bug films of the 50's & 60's only Eight Legged Freaks had the sort of budget most of those films could only dream of. The script never takes itself too seriously even if it does tend to go a bit too far on occasion with the jokey scenes (the scene with the cat is just dumb while the disappearing ostrich scene is quite funny), the pace is good at less than 100 minutes, there's plenty going on, there's lots of fun references & it's a great film overall with some superb set-pieces but the character's are really lacking here with maybe the blandest bunch of B-Movie character's seen in a long time from the annoying comedy relief DJ & Deputy to an old lady to the greedy businessman to the local Sheriff to a highly irritating kid with glasses who seems to know everything about spiders & if they had put him in charge no-one would have been killed. I just couldn't get behind anyone & I wanted the spiders to win & actually felt more sorry for the killer spiders than the humans. Eight Legged Freaks is a fun popcorn flick to sit back with, take it easy & just enjoy the ride but I doubt I would want to see it again in a hurry & some of those character's are awful.The one thing I will say about Eight Legged Freaks is that the CGI computer effects are very impressive with some terrific scenes of all sorts of giant spiders attacking people including some jumping spiders terrorising kids on motorbikes & a giant tarantula attacking a mobile home. Anyone with a dislike of spiders, there's plenty of them about, might get creeped out while watching Eight Legged Freaks as the effects really are that good. The one aspect of Eight Legged Freaks that really annoyed me more than anything else was the constant roaring & squeaking noises made the spiders, in reality spiders don't make any noise & I personally thought it just sounded weird & something in my brain kept telling me it was wrong. The film tries to strike a balance between funny & scary & for the most part it works although I did think the comedy elements were a little bit too in your face at times & even worse not that funny.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 Eight Legged Freaks didn't set the box-office alight, actually shot in Arizona the production values are very good & it's well made with a definite affection by the makers to the giant bug flicks that inspired it. Maybe one reason for Eight Legged Freaks not doing so well at the box-office is because there are no real star names in it, you have David Arquette & that's about it which says it all.Eight Legged Freaks is a great homage to those giant bug flicks of the 50's & 60's & most of the quirky sci-fi horror loving crowd should enjoy it. I did although I found the human character's far less likable & memorable than than the eight legged kind. Goof fun & well worth a watch.",Eight Legged Freaks
17,grantss,Common-or-garden creature-horror,4,31 May 2014,"Common-or-garden creature-horror movie. Only worth watching because it includes a pre-fame Scarlett Johansson.Not original - reminds me a lot of Tremors (which itself wasn't that original). Pretty much standard creature-horror plot, action and CGI.Even the CGI, which you would think would be the best feature, seems a bit crude.As mentioned, worth watching because it includes Scarlett Johansson before she was famous. Her next movie was Lost in Translation...Kari Wuhrer is also eminently watchable.

18,Boba_Fett1138,"Fun movie, obviously not one to take serious.",6,24 September 2006,"If you're going to watch ""Eight Legged Freaks"" expecting a tense 'monster' movie with spectacular action and a solid story you shouldn't even think about watching this movie. ""Eight Legged Freaks"" is a pretty fun parody/homage to the fake and ridiculous monster movies from the '50's.As a parody/homage this movie is a pretty good and successful one. It uses all of the genre clichés and the movie is filled with some typical B-movie moments, characters and dialog, which obviously were put intentionally into the movie. It makes ""Eight Legged Freaks"" a fun movie to watch, especially when you're familiar with the '50's B-movie monster genre.But just because its fun, that doesn't mean that the movie is a great or perfect one to watch. There are several things wrong with this movie, which is the reason why the movie is overall still a bit of a disappointing one. I expected a fun perfect to watch parody/homage but the end result was a mixed movie with a fun and comical undertone but also with a disjointed story with simple characters which makes this movie not always a pleasant one to follow.The overly present humor makes sure that the movie never gets tense or horrifying. Because of the tone of the movie you can never take the movie and what happens in it ever serious. That's the reason why it lacks in tension, which causes this movie also being far from an interesting or compelling one. ""Eight Legged Freaks"" is fun but not great to watch.The movie its story starts off well and promising but soon after that it starts falling flat when it begins to introduce and follow way too many characters. Some of the characters aren't in the movie for like 15 minutes but then suddenly pops up again and the movie starts to follow them like they are some of the key characters of the movie. It makes ""Eight Legged Freaks"" feel like a disjointed movie, filled with some arachnid attack sequence without feeling an obvious connection. This also adds to the reason why the movie isn't exactly a very tense, exciting or compelling one to watch.The effects of the movie are only so-so. I don't know it this was done on intention but I don't think so. They should had made the effects look entirely convincing or entirely fake looking. Now it's somewhere in between.The actors did a great job. They obviously knew to not play their characters very seriously with as a result that they help to set up the right mood and B-movie atmosphere. Especially David Arquette did a great job with this. It was also great to see Scarlett Johansson in a role before her great breakthrough one year later. No way she would had ever played in a movie like this one now, at this moment.By no means a must-see but when you watch it you'll probably have a good time, if you at least know not to take it very serious all.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Eight Legged Freaks
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,A highly entertaining spoof of the old 50's sci-fi horror movies,7,6 March 2004,"This is a parody of the old B-movies of the 50's, concerning gigantic animals, mostly spiders. It's filled with corny humor and cheesy special effects, which only help to make it a funnier spoof movie. It spoofs a few other well-known movies too, there are references to Indiana Jones, Tarzan and the likes. The plot is far-fetched and extremely cheesy, but it's all in context with the very theme of the movie. The acting is mostly not very convincing, but it once again fits perfectly. Half of the actors are not exactly A-list actors, so they did OK, in my opinion. The characters are either cliches, caricatures or stereotypes, which makes sense, considering it's just a spoof movie. The special effects are pretty good, not great, but good. They definitely fit with the movie perfectly. Something I found particularly funny was the cheesy sound effects and the nice touches that contained great humor; most of the spiders seem to have their own unique personality, which is shown by a collaboration of campy sound effects and comical movements by the spiders. I would recommend this to any person who enjoys spoof movies, especially ones which contain campy humor; I'd also recommend it to anyone who's seen one or more of the old ""giant spiders"" movies, and couldn't take it seriously. 7/10",Eight Legged Freaks
20,view_and_review,Arachnophobia magnified,7,29 April 2007,"""Eight Legged Freaks"" earned my respect simply because it never tried to pretend to be something it wasn't. It came right out and let it be known that it was a 'B' style comedy horror (or horror comedy, however it is supposed to be worded), instead of trying to disguise itself as a genuine and serious scary movie. They even gave the movie a silly name. If more movies were as honest as ""Eight Legged Freaks"", then they would probably do better at the box office, and they would definitely get better reviews because the audience would already know what they are going to watch. ""Eight Legged Freaks"" was very much like ""Arachnophobia"" of the early 90's except with the small difference, or should I say large difference. Of course, in ""Eight Legged Freaks"" the spiders were gargantuan and terrorized an entire town as opposed to being small and just terrorizing a couple of households. I liked the movie, it was funny, it was eerie and it was as cheesy as advertised.",Eight Legged Freaks
21,Uriah43,Lots of Spiders and Action,3,20 July 2016,"One night on a dark, desert highway the driver of a truck carrying a few barrels of hazardous chemicals takes a turn too quickly and one of the barrels accidentally gets dumped into a pond off of the side of the road. As luck would have it this pond just happens to be near a house where an eccentric man collects all kinds of spiders. Noticing that the insects near the pond have started to grow to a pretty good size, the man gleefully begins to use them as food for his exotic pets. What he doesn't count on is these spiders getting loose and subsequently growing to a massive size. Soon the residents of a nearby town notice that their cats and dogs are disappearing with no apparent explanation for it. However, that soon changes one night when the spiders decide to start feeding on the humans as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this started off as a decent sci-fi/horror film not unlike those seen back in the 50's. Unfortunately, the focus shifted from horror and suspense to non-stop action which resulted in an all-too-typical over-reliance on special effects and other assorted gimmicks thus causing it to essentially morph into a host of similar movies produced in the last decade or so. Basically, if you've seen one action film like this then you've pretty much seen them all. And, quite frankly, there's only so much enjoyment a person can get from watching the same action-packed scenario over and over again. In short, there were a lot of big spiders killing people for almost 90 minutes followed afterward by a rather predictable ending. No doubt those who enjoy movies of this type will absolutely love this particular film. However, I got bored with it after the first 30 minutes or so and I have rated it accordingly.

Doug, Rick Overton: Presenting a mutating normality that isn't a great idea. The simple plot regards a barrel of toxic substance spilling into a river with a growth affect on spiders. What follows is numerous attacks on people for no other purpose than to entertain stupidity. Horrible special effects with spiders jumping out at people but it doesn't even look as if any contact is being made. Repetitious story with director Ellory Elkayem quoting from other pathetic spider trauma movies. David Arquette hardly sympathetic as he arrives back in town after ten years away. After this film he may desire to take ten years off from acting so to forget this sh*t stain film altogether. Kari Wuhrer plays a Sheriff who warns daughter Scarlett Johansson about sexually corrupt males. Perhaps she should warn her about accepting scripts as lame as this one and then apply the same medicine to herself. Doug E. Doug plays a radio personality who believes in aliens. Well, if he believes that this film is a career booster then perhaps he can believe in anything. Rick Overton plays Wuhrer's moron Deputy who has cob webs for brains. Basically a send off to superior monster movies of the 1950's but this film should be squashed with an oversized sledgehammer. Score: 3 / 10",Eight Legged Freaks
23,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Wholly fun and enjoyable creature feature,9,29 October 2016,"After returning to a small Arizona mining town, a man hoping to settle his past debts instead finds that it's being overrun by gigantic mutated spiders born from toxic waste and must band the town's survivors together to ward off the rapidly-growing approaching creatures.This one here was a highly-enjoyable effort. Most of this here is due to the film's rather goofy atmosphere, which comes from comes from the good old glorious creature-feature fun that's featured throughout this one. The film is mostly done with an old-school spirit and a lot of cheese, and the fact that some of it's good gives this one some of it's better scenes here in the manner of how the spiders not only get mutated and then later escape from their lab, their running around the outskirts of town grabbing animals and the rather fun encounters where the creatures hit the different home of the residents. These here are balanced out incredibly well by the film's other high-impact style of action here with the genuinely exciting and thrilling encounters with the extended dirt-bike chase that's one of the film's highlights with the creatures jumping onto the bikers and the really frantic chase that emerges from the scene, the family's charge into town that goes from the spiders' appearance at their house and the gunfight to get away as well as arriving in town itself which is the kind of cheesy action-packed goodness found in most monster movies where the creature's rampage across the city attacking townspeople in great attacks or surprise shock scenes in a huge, extended sequence leading into even more thrilling action afterwards. There's a lot of great work here in the spiders coming inside to get them forcing a wholly exciting series of action scenes inside the mall and down underground which really goes for the grand extended scenes of the group trying to get through the massive cobwebbed tunnels with the spiders chasing them and leading into the last big attempt at finishing them off which really works quite well in it's uniqueness and explosive action. That it features a lot of action makes for a fun time, and alongside the cheesy antics gives this one a lot to really like. Although these here do work, it does have a couple of minor flaws, stemming mainly from the fact that while it may work it's cheesiness to great effect some of it not so much as it can be too silly for it's own good. The creatures here are threatening only in their size and proclivity towards attacking people, though every other facet about them might be more troubling with their comedic screams and cries while attacking making this quite cheesy overall. Beyond that, their CGI-laden creation makes for some rather troubling times with their inherently fake look and sheer static-filled appearance looking quite ridiculous at times and readily contributing to an overall cheesy feature. The last flaw here is the film's rather surprising ease which it demonstrates all the different species here working together as a whole at hunting them down since it's stated several times about the different species being together yet there's nothing about why as several of the species shouldn't work together. There's a lot to like, even though it does need work in a few areas.Rated PG-13: Violence and Language.",Eight Legged Freaks
24,FlashCallahan,Spider people from Mars.....,4,5 April 2017,"The residents of a mining town discover that a chemical spill has caused hundreds of spiders to mutate overnight to the size of SUVs. It's then up to mining engineer Chris McCormack and Sheriff Sam Parker to gather a group of townspeople, including the Sheriff's son, Mike, her daughter, Ashley, and radio announcer Harlan, into battle against the eight- legged behemoths.With all the good intentions of the film trying to homage creature features from the fifties, Eight Legged Freaks forgets to do the important thing when homaging a genre, to make it a fun.I wanted something in the vein of Gremlins, something that was dark, as well as funny, but it's not dark at all, in fact, watching it 14 years after it's release, it's about at the standard of an Asylum production.To make a film like this, you really have to go over the top with the narrative, because after the initial Spider rampage starts, you need some characters who are eccentric, and have some strange character traits.The cast are okay, but they have nothing about them. Arquette just does Dewey, but with a higher intellect, Doug E Doug plays the most interesting character, but again, they could have really made the paranoid DJ just that little more crazier.In a world where Sharknado and Lavantula exist, this bigger budget product looks quite lame compared to those two franchises, because it's just a little to serious for it's own good.Only worth seeing if you have a strange desire to see Scarlett Johannssen get covered in a spider web....",Eight Legged Freaks

This is a tale of spiders that mutated from some chemicals and grow to giant size and attack. Simple enough.  The effects were good and the actors were rather good themselves.  Arquette was good too, and that was somewhat surprising.  There were three or four different types of spiders on the rampage so you got to see them kill in different ways.  The comedy was pretty good too, as this one doesn't take itself to seriously.  I agree with those who said it was like a 50's sci-fi flick and it is definitely worth a look.",Eight Legged Freaks
26,Wuchakk,Amusing horror/comedy with Scar-Jo & Kari Wuhrer,6,26 September 2014,"As the name would indicate, ""Eight Legged Freaks"" shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's a horror comedy about a variety of arachnids growing huge due to -- what else? -- accidentally spilled toxic waste. They terrorize the citizens of Prosperity, Arizona, where Kari Wuhrer plays the Sheriff, Scarlett Johansson her teen daughter, and David Arquette the Sheriff's love interest.The plot of terrorizing arachnids in an Arizona town automatically brings to mind 1977's ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" with William Shatner, but that movie took the topic serious and the tarantulas were normal size.The Arizona locations are great and the movie is consistently amusing as ""Eight Legged Freaks"" is just a fun flick, but the main highlight is the mother/daughter combo of Kari Wuhrer and Scar-Jo. Kari has a strikingly attractive face and personality and Scar-Jo was 17 years-old during filming and looks great in tight pants.On the downside the film seems too long at 99 minutes because there isn't enough depth to the characters and their story to warrant going over like 85 minutes. As such, the final act in the mall, mines, etc. seems to go on forever. Another criticism is that the spider F/X appear too cartoony (I'm sure they looked better in 2002), but this is hardly a flaw in that the movie itself is cartoony. My main beef is that Scar-Jo isn't prominent enough, but that's likely because she was only 17 and wouldn't become a ""star"" until her next film, 2003' excellent ""Lost in Translation."" On the other hand, Wuhrer is very prominent.GRADE: B-",Eight Legged Freaks
27,zetes,Not nearly as fun as it should be,5,21 July 2002,"Swerving to miss a rabbit, a truck driver accidentally loses a barrel of toxic waste. It ends up making the crickets in the area `like spider steroids.' A local spiderologist feeds them to his little friends. They get a bit testy, grow too big, and then eat him. Soon, they are terrorizing the small town of Prosperity, Arizona. It should have been easy to make a fun creature feature out of the material, but the filmmakers miss every opportunity. I'm scared to death by spiders (which is why I decided to see it), but there's not even a half-assed attempt to make these CGI beasties into believable arachnids. Spiders are scary because of the creepy way they move, and Eight Legged Freaks' spiders move the wrong way. Not an ounce of research went into the film. It would have made all the difference! There are some funny parts, but not nearly enough to make it worth seeing. Add to that the fact that there isn't a single good character in the film. David Arquette will never be a movie star. Kari Wuhrer and Scarlett Johansson (best known for her recent roles in The Man Who Wasn't There and Ghost World) do halfway decent jobs (although I don't believe for a second that Johansson is Wuhrer's daughter; they're like eight years apart!), and Doug E. Doug and Rick Overton provide some decent comic relief (although Doug's character gets very annoying as the film nears its end, reminiscent of Chris Tucker's DJ character from The Fifth Element).

29,StevePulaski,Great badness,6,19 June 2012,"The most riveting sequence that exists in Eight Legged Freaks is the scene where spunky teenager Bret (Matt Czurchy) is riding his dirtbike over sandy desert hills trying to evade and outsmart monstrous leaping spiders. The scene is so ridiculous, free-spirited, and equipped with such an improbable finale it brings a smile to an easily amused face. Eight Legged Freaks is so consumed with on-the-spot amusement, its kinetic creatures, and asinine events that, sometimes, the only thing one can do is grin and chuckle at it all.Its goal is to pay homage or perhaps parody such classic monster films; the ones I can think of on the spot are Empire of the Ants and Them! which follow the same blueprint. The film has just enough fun and excitement to pack in before it hits its slow second act and its groggy third. By then, the joke has become unraveled and worn, unlike the spiders' webs, the story becomes a joke, the characters become lamer, and the film turns into a laborious exercise stockpiled with anarchic idiocy.We are placed in the ""trailer trash town"" of Prosperity, Arizona (instantly reminds me of Perfection, Nevada in Tremors, with its adjective for a town name and state that's more than half desert area), where we see a young boy named Mike (Scott Terra), who is fascinated by a spider farmer's collection of arachnids. The spiders are quite muscular, and able to jump a severely questionable length at a severely questionable speed. Upon Mike's departure, the farmer is attacked and cocooned by his collection, and the spiders are free to roam around Prosperity.At the same time all this is occurring, Chris McCormick (David Arquette) returns to his hometown and hears the mayor of the town is planning to sell the mines his father helped construct. He gets into a fight with the mayor, and is reprimanded by the gorgeous Sheriff Sam Stroud (Kari Wührer), the mother of Mike and Ashley (Scarlett Johansson), her rebellious teen daughter.When the spiders begin to grow to larger proportions, the town starts becoming their prime target, and all this time Sheriff Sam was so infuriated when Mike visited Josh to learn about spiders, he now becomes the commander in chief.From there on out, what is to be said? The spiders begin to rip up everything in their sight, the town becomes deliriously paranoid about the attack, when most of them didn't believe it in the first place, and Chris and Sam become the protagonists and help kill off the spiders. Another character is the extraterrestrial enthusiast, Harlan Griffiths (Doug E. Doug), who operates a radio show ""exposing"" government conspiracies and broadcasts it through the town. He becomes involved in this epidemic, helping Chris and Sam along the way.The effects on the spiders are surprisingly decent. They are a nice hybrid of traditional, effect-driven monster films, yet still occupy enough realism for the new age. Not to mention, they are sort of fun to watch, especially during the desert/dirtbike scene. Watching them jump is a unique experience too. When they do, there is some audio distortion that sounds like wind hitting a cheap camera. It's not a complaint, but an observation. It provides the film with the campy quality it is seeking, and I must give it credit for that. In those respects, the film achieves what it wants to be.But there are some inevitable things that do come up along the way. If one were to scroll through other monster movie tributes of recent time, they will find a much better selection. Tremors is the one that comes to mind instantly; among my favorite monster films. In that picture, we had sufficient characters who weren't overrating to be cute or memorable, but realistically responding to situations, great character actors in their positions, and some wonderful scenic backdrops to give us a nice, welcomed countryside vibe. Eight Legged Freaks does nothing but remind me how that film worked so well with so little. It was a tribute to the weird west monster films, but didn't glorify and embellish its purpose of existence. Not to mention, it was a helluva a lot more concise, and doesn't push one hundred minutes and a twenty minute climax. It's all worth it just to hear that annoyingly catchy rendition of ""Itsy Bitsy Spider"" during the end credits.NOTE: The scene where the cat is viciously mauled by a giant spider inside the walls of a house - why?Starring: David Arquette, Kari Wührer, Scott Terra, Scarlett Johansson, Matt Czurchy, and Doug E.

31,MovieAddict2016,The Most Overlooked Parody of Last Year...Pure Fun from Start to Finish!,10,16 April 2003,"""Eight Legged Freaks"" was originally titled ""Arac Attack"" before the film's star, David Arquette, thought of a better title (""Eight Legged Freaks""). The great thing about this title is it sets up the film perfectly--it's a parody, and a surprisingly entertaining and hilarious and fun one, too.David Arquette is the film's main character: the local boy who has returned after 10 years and still has a crush on cute Sheriff Sam Parker (Kari Wuhrer). Once he arrives, he tries to spark a relationship with her, but everything is put on hold when mutated spiders (which formed from pollution in the mining caves) start to attack humans and animals, and everything goes haywire. Now David's character must put an end to these eight legged freaks before all legs break loose. (Yeah, that was a pretty bad pun.)""Eight Legged Freaks"" was one of the biggest surprises of last year, mainly because it was so darn funny and such a good spoof. I went into the theater expecting, at the bare minimum, a film with a rating of...say...2, 2.5/5 stars. I'd have to give this a 3.5. It was completely overlooked, probably the most overlooked film of last year (though that is pushing it). The parody is classic.Do you remember those old films about mining towns in the middle of nowhere, population: 9, where giant grasshoppers, spiders, worms--heck, I saw a film with giant ants once--start attacking? That's what ""Eight Legged Freaks"" spoofs. It takes the old formulas and twists it around to have fun with.Towards the end I found myself having such a pleasurable experience that I couldn't believe this film was so underrated. Nothing is more fun than seeing a bunch of people going after giant spiders with shotguns--it's pure fun. The people that went into this film expecting Oscar material were nuts.The most sad thing about ""Eight Legged Freaks"" is that the people going into ""Men in Black II"" were probably expecting something like this: something funny, smart, original, witty, and satirical. I went into ""Men in Black II"" expecting something as good as ""Eight Legged Freaks,"" and apparently Roger Ebert did, too. I'm on the same level with him, because I thought this film was extremely entertaining. There are some plot holes and stupid cliches, but most of them are there to be made fun of. People going into deserted malls late at night trying to escape the spiders, people going into the lair of the spiders (which ends in them being chased by a giant Black Widow Spider). Y'know those movies where people do things, and you hear people in the movie theater (maybe it's you) shouting, ""Don't go in there! It'll get you!""? That's what ""Eight Legged Freaks"" plays on. Basically this film makes fun of every misused B-monster movie cliche, and that's what is so darn funny about this movie.This film delivered everything I go to the movies for.3.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",Eight Legged Freaks

33,sddavis63,Surprisingly Decent,7,10 February 2015,"I have to admit (and maybe this is sexist) that when Kari Wuhrer appeared playing the sheriff of this Arizona town it was almost enough to make me give up almost before the movie started. She just doesn't fit the bill. Too young. Too pretty. But truthfully - as the movie goes on, she works in the role. First, her performance was pretty good, and second, it's a movie that forces you to suspend your disbelief anyway, and so the fact that she doesn't work in the role actually makes her work in the role. If you see what I mean. Sheriff Parker has a big job on her hands. Her town is being invaded by giant spiders, grown into huge mutants by the dumping of toxic waste. There are tarantulas and jumping spiders and trapdoor spiders and all kinds of - well - eight legged freaks. (The name of the movie sums it up so well!) There's an interesting enough cast of co-stars for Wuhrer, including David Arquette as the owner of the local mine who's just returned to town, Scarlett Johansson as the sheriff's daughter Ashley, and Doug E. Doug as a guy running an outlaw radio station who believes in every conspiracy theory going.The story's fun, it's sometimes exciting and every now and then frightening - and it does have a few ""cringe"" moments as the spiders do what spiders do. Sure it's a silly movie - but I suppose that it does have barely beneath the surface a serious undertone about the environmental dangers of toxic waste. Establishing the romantic link towards the end between Arquette and Wuhrer was too predictable and too formulaic, and not at all necessary for the story.

Naturally, it comes in contact with crickets, which are used to feed a collector's exotic spider collection and over a short matter of time these spiders have vastly grown. Arriving in town is a old resident, Chris McCormack who has return home after 10 years to look for the supposed gold that his deceased father claim was in their mine and also hopefully to clear up a certain matter with the lady he secretly loves; Samantha Parker, the town's sheriff. He discovers that the town is in ruin, but he wants to help it back from its economical ruin by finding that gold. But he didn't plan on the town soon being overrun by giant spiders! Now it's up to Chris, Sam and a small group of folks to team up and settle this ""massive"" problem.""Eight Legged Freaks"" is a lively B-grade, Sci-fi parody on the giant monster features from the Cold War era, where it combines nuclear matter with the disgusting fear of creepy crawlies. But this project adds some campy charm to proceedings, which does share a common interest with the even better ""Tremors (1990)"". This is a enjoyable, no-brainer of a film that doesn't waste any time by giving what the audience wants! There's nothing overly clever about it, but it delivers the excitement and occasion laugh when needed. While, the story might seem heavily cartoonish, the director is capable enough to provide good timing with the goofy humour and that of some thrilling set pieces that can raise some tense energy. What you'll notice would be the constant homage's cropping up and it goes out of its way to poke fun of the usual clichés that make headway in these films. The script is mostly in tongue-in-cheek and doesn't go into sort of mumbo-jumbo, but there are some self-knowing winks about too. The performances are all played with a straight-face, which definitely works in its favour and the combine cast turn in fine performances (yep, even David Arquette!). David Arquette is surprisingly good in a tone down way as the awkward Chris McCormack and his babelicious co-star Kari Wuhrer (who mostly makes appearances in shoddy b-grades) is equally impressive as Sheriff Samantha Parker. Other recognizable faces offered solid support included the always wonderful Scarlett Johansson, the humorous deputy sheriff played by Rick Overton and Doug E. Doug is the paranoid disc jockey, the usual comic relief guy. Now the film's main talking point has got to be well-presented CGI arachnids who come in many different shapes, sizes and personalities. Which, would create a spine tingling thought with anyone who suffers arachnophobia with the giant infestation of spiders who have a growing appetite. Though, one thing against the creative effects was that it was probably, terribly overused. The versatile score works out greatly too, by sticking with and drumming out the right tone to what's eventuating on screen. Also the closing gimmick song in the ending credits; ""Itsy bitsy spider"" by Joey Deluxe is rather a nice touch. Just expect some happy, feel good entertainment.Sure it's forgettable, but I found it a delightful B-grade spoof that achieves what it was sets out to do. This throwback is nothing more than some good, lazy fun.Side-note: Definitely check out Ellory Elkayem's suspenseful, experimental short film ""Larger than Life"" to see the inspiration for this piece.",Eight Legged Freaks

Perhaps an autumn release would have suited ELF. But then any movie opening opposite MIIB and taking a portion of its audience is fine by me.While he may not be the best director in town, executive producer Roland Emmerich knows what makes a good movie and his hobby seems to be lampooning paranoid Fifties sci-fi. Think of Independence Day (a War Of The Worlds update) or Godzilla (another radioactivity created monster). Do these movies want to be taken seriously? No, of course not. They were made to entertain and that they do with reckless abandon Eight Legged Freaks is another take on Fifties paranoia. Don't mistake this for an Arachnophobia clone. ELF does not make the goof of creating small monsters. They are massive. The cause for this mutation? Radioactivity. Only, when these suckers bite you they won't turn you into Peter Parker camping it up in a bad Sam Raimi movie.David Arquette plays goofball Chris McCormick, who returns to his hometown of Prosperity, Arizona, only to find it on the verge of bankruptcy.

He handles the far-fetched hokum very well and with a constant sense of humor - the cat being eaten off-screen is hilarious. It's weird that a film with a 12/PG13 rating can get away with so much death. Many, many extras are offed by the ELF, which squirt multi-coloured puss and goo everywhere when they are squished. Perhaps the movie's only failing is that it kills off too many innocent people. While not graphic, there's no big fun in human death.The script is better than you would expect. There is enough character, situation and invention to elevate beyond its roots. It's hard to pull off a B-movie making fun of B-movies, but ELF ends up being a better film than mainstream crud, such as Minority Report or Reign Of Fire.Think of it as Tremors with spiders and having the imagination of Gremlins - only better.

Also I don't like to spoil things you can check out my other reviews for examples although not much to spoil about this except maybe David Arquette is a balls deep hero and you'll learn that as you watch it even though it's been out awhile now so this is mostly for anyone new.",Eight Legged Freaks
39,Movie Nuttball,A good funny film!,10,1 November 2002,"Eight Legged Freaks is a good comedy.David Arquette plays a serious role and Kari Wuhrer looked great in the film.Rick Overton and Doug E. Doug was good.Leon Rippy was good.Tom Noonan to Me had a surprising role which he played very good.Though I didn't really think the comedy was with the actors I mostly laughed at the spiders because how they acted. They made little noises which almost sounded like words. It was hilarious when one of the eight leggers jumped on a stuffed animal and took a bite out of it and then spit it out and said something like Puwie! It was very funny! Most of the spiders did funny things.the effects are great! I liked this movie as it was a different type of comedy which was somewhat serious.I recommend all fans of comedy,horror,sc-fi,and spider films to see eight legged freaks!Note: The film at the end of the VHS version has special bonus footage.They are scene that never made it in the film which in My opinion the one with Leon Rippy when he talks about his ostriches played a big part in the film but was deleted.",Eight Legged Freaks
40,johnnyboyz,"A fun 99 minutes..........that's it, I'm afraid.",6,28 June 2006,"It's the return of the classic sci-fi/horror film using large insects as the 'bad guys' and using them as an excuse to create chaos! In fact, it's a throw back to the classical Hollywood era when films like 'Them' (1954) (which was actually featured in Eight Legged Freaks) and the original 'King Kong' from 1933 were made. Unfortunately, this new more modern edition doesn't hold up too well; in fact it wouldn't be a travesty if it was never even made in the first place.The main problem with Eight Legged Freaks is its 'B-movie' approach. Its typical science fiction and horror genre laden content is blended with comedy in a rather distasteful manner and this glares rather badly throughout. The film actually starts out rather well. The stage is set without too much messing around and it's clearly established that the 'kid' is cleverer than his age suggests, we're even introduced to the comic relief character of the film (The radio DJ) rather cleverly and this introduction blends into the initial incident of the toxic waste coming into contact with the towns water supply. In fact, there are a few incidences like this which blend into one another rather nicely; another being the connection between a good action/chase scene and the phone lines cutting out so the beginning is done well. Unfortunately, the acting is pretty shocking all round through out the film and the dialogue is constantly ruined as a result. Another odd thing about this film is the fact that although I'm slightly arachnophobic, I found the smaller, real spiders scarier to watch than the bigger, more fake ones. Any one else who suffers from the fear need not worry to be honest, as you really do get used to them after a while, especially by the time the mall scenes arrive and they're swarming all over the place.There are a lot of annoying flaws in this film, one of which is the fight between a house cat and a giant spider which occurs behind a recently plastered wall. We actually see imprints of the cat and spiders 'expressions' from the outside and this immediately extinguishes any suspense or fear we're feeling as a result of the eerie build up prior to this fight. This also counter acts something that happens later on in the film as a dog is faced with a similar situation/fight and is killed without any fuss at all so it makes you think that the cat fight would never had happened like it did. The fact that this spider remains in the guy's house for, what we assume to be, the duration of the film yet the character living there remains unharmed by it. Are we to believe it stayed there in the house within the walls the whole time? Even during the night when the guy's sleeping? Apparently it did.Another incident is when the genius kid is dumb enough to venture deep into a mine entrance early on in the film. He knows something's 'up' and the giant webs and discovery of a large spider leg should be enough evidence to deter him from venturing into the entrance, but he goes in anyway. Another occurrence is the fact that a character is willing to go out onto the roof of a building yet when we're all finally out there, he exclaims that he's afraid of heights. Did the writer(s) realise this? Did they even KNOW their characters and what they would/ would not do? Evidently not; take a lesson from Tarantino(!) By the finishing act of the film, you can't help but feel that you've seen it all before anyway. The final fight takes place in a shopping mall which is a homage to 'Dawn of the Dead' (1978) I'm sure, not only this but hints of 'Deep Rising' (1998) occur. If you've seen it, replace a motorbike with a jet ski, fill in a couple of other blanks and I'm sure you'll get the picture.All in all, it's an enjoyable film but I can't help but think the whole 'B-movie' thing is just an excuse to paper over the cracks which are there. I'm not looking at it for what it is with a relaxed mind, I'm merely warning/informing you of what is actually there if you choose to watch it. To sum it up in one word: Frustrating.",Eight Legged Freaks

It has a surprisingly good script, and a probable story, stretched I guess, a little bit. When spiders feed off this toxic waste, they augment to gigantic proportions, and the whole show town becomes their pray. I must say, the whole spider thing is well staged. The spiders look awesome. If you hated Arachnophobia, then make this one, the last film, you'll never want to see. It's a great starring vehicle for Arquette, who returns to town to his old love, cop, Wuhner, who's arrest of some young teens, mirrors that same familiar scene with cop, Shue, in Piranha. The thrilling action and spiders come in spades making for a great monster flick, with a little bit of sappy romance, which heightens it's quality some. This is much better than a lot of type of monster, pick off victims, flicks. It even has the killer from Manhunter, of all people, as a geeky hermit who has a fascination with, of course spiders, who Wuhner's nerdy son hangs out with. Just leave your brain at the door, sit back and enjoy the guilty pleasure ride and popcorn flick, and let the spiders do their thing.",Eight Legged Freaks

This movie is directed by Ellory Elkayem (They Nest) and stars David Arquette (Scream), Kari Wuhrer (Thinner), Scarlett Johansson (Scoop) and Scott Terra (Daredevil). This movie is super fun in a Tremors/Gremlins kind of way and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's also really fun to see a young Scarlett Johansson in this. The special effects are really good and so are most of the kill scenes. There's some really great dialogue in this - both for comedy as well as to develop the relationship between characters. The ending is a bit blah and focuses more on being funny than good; but overall, this movie has great entertainment value. I'd score this a solid 7/10 and call it a must see.",Eight Legged Freaks

45,aidanratesmovies,Do Yourself a Favor and Watch Arachnophobia Instead,4,7 June 2021,"Although it does start out with the fun B-movie antics you would expect from it- Eight Legged Freaks is ultimately weighed down by its rather tedious and useless plot devices and its overdone cheesey antics. I tried to go in open minded to this film, I had heard many bad things about it, but expected it to be at least a somewhat fun little flick I could enjoy for 100 minutes or so. Sadly, it just tries too hard for it to be any real fun. It has a promising start, but once we get into the plot with the deputy's family, the son of some town idol, and other bologna no one watching cares about- you begin to loose focus and interest in the plot its setting up. Once the giant spiders do come though, it's almost like the same scene again and again and again- and it gets frustrating to watch rather than finding any true enjoyment. The CGI is comically bad, and the acting is trash as well, and David Arquette providing his usual tough nerdy guy character persona to his role is anything but refreshing. In the end, Eight Legged Freaks is a missed opportunity of a fun ride, which instead settles for cheap antics and CGI for what could have been a real blast.My Rating: 3.6/10.",Eight Legged Freaks

When I saw the original trailer, I knew this would be some cheesy satire, especially when David Arquette and Kari Wuhrer are receiving top billing. Full of bad puns and cheesy special effects, this film really embodies the old school monster movies that had bad special effects and poorly feigned fear. I especially loved the fact it was based in Arizona, and it had a lot of cultural aspects of the state few ever get to see (the dieing mining industry, the short lived fad of ostrich farming, and paranoid fanatics). However, Tucsonans were portrayed as nothing more than yokels, which continues the constant bad mouthing my home town gets (see Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion, Final Fantasy and The 13th Floor).

Kari Wuhrer is hot to watch and I've always thought David Arquette was an underrated actor. The special effects are good and the film keeps up a good pace so as not to drag. I do think it could have been better like not having the spiders uttering noises! They give the spiders the same sound effects as the Gremlins had in two movies. And the spiders here really don't act like spiders. Spiders don't go roaming around hunting for food. And why was Arquette's aunt one of two survivors they found in cocoons? Spiders bite and paralyze. But thats just nit-picking. Its a lot of fun to watch and belongs in the category of guilty pleasure.,Eight Legged Freaks

In fact, I was right. ""Eight Legged Freaks"" utilizes some aspects of the scary 1990's ""Arachnophobia"" and creates some giant spiders that terrify a small city. As very expected for this kind of movie, the main characters always end up escaping from the monsters, whilst the unimportant subplot dies in a matter of seconds. I must confess the cast is very professional, with big congratulations to Kari Wuhrer and David Arquette-- this one, for finally doing a decent job, after his boring character at ""Scream""'s franchise. My only complaint is that the movie feels overlong, specially for me who hates action scenes, since there were minutes and minutes of never ending running away.

If the plot summary, title, poster, and presence of David Arquette isn't enough of a tip-off, rest assured that this one has all eight of its feet in campy/cheesy territory; the problem is that it doesn't go far enough in that goofy direction (it's certainly not serious or scary). The script isn't witty enough to be clever, not outrageous enough to be pure schlock, nor focused enough to be satirical; similarly, the special effects should either be a lot better or a lot worse to work. Workmanlike direction doesn't help much, either. Its overall effect is quite mild, a passable way to waste an hour-and-a-half watching giant arachnids stomp around, but most of its inspirations (""Tremors,"" ""Arachnophobia,"" any number of 50s atomic monster rampage flicks, etc.) are more fun.

It's a junk food movie, as some old-timers put it, but it's also a gem for people who love monster films and creature features. The golden age for said sub-genres is long gone, but occasional movies such as Eight Legged Freaks let you know there's still people out there hungry for more.The spider effects and various effects surrounding the spiders (such as web-shooting and whatnot) hold up surprisingly well for a movie that came out in the early 2000's; a time when God-awful CGI was ruining movies from the get-go and destroying the future potentiality for re-watches.The characters and acting isn't awful, but it's not great, either. You should expect that with these types of movies. It's a given.

This means Chris (Arquette) has picked a bad time to come home for the first time in over a decade, even if is for the noble intent of stopping Big Business from trying to buy out the town for some initially unknown (but assuredly fiendish and underhanded) reasons.This leads to Chris, a young Scarlett Johansson, B movie queen Kari Wuhrer and some bug-loving kid to join forces against an incredible array of over-sized arachnids – 95% of them the CGI variety – who after they announce themselves to the sleepy town jump, crawl, scuttle and leap after, on and over the local population.It's silly, inane, implausible and full of crappy effects and even worse acting, and the sound effects have to be heard to be (incredulously) believed. Just about everything that you could ask for in your B Movie creature feature really.The only major drawback to Eight Legged Freaks is the dodgy CGI, this could have been Piranha 3-ish with today's computers and a few better jokes. That aside if you're after a decently atrocious $1 weekly rental you could do a lot worse, if only to see that even at a young age Scar-Jo already had a fair amount of what has made her so famous today.

Although one thing that apparently nobody could realize is that you CAN'T hold a shotgun like the way they do in this movie. The butt of the gun can't just be hanging out there in midair behind your elbow like they do here. That would just break your wrists.

Eventually Chris McCormick (David Arquette), the owner of the town's exhausted gold mine gets sees the spiders for himself and sets out to help save the tow from being overrun.Directed by Ellory Elkayem who made insect based horror film They Nest, the movie was the first producing project for frequent Roland Emmerich (who serves as an executive producer) collaborator Dean Devlin's newly established production company Electric Entertainment. The movie had a modest run upon release making a respectable $45 million against its $30 million budget. The movie hasn't had much staying power since its release, and that's mostly because it doesn't do much that wasn't done better by other similar movies.In the tradition of films like Critters, Arachnophobia, and especially Tremors, Eight Legged Freaks takes 50s b-movie settings of ""desert set town attacked by killer giant _____"" playing itself for laughs. Unfortunately while Eight Legged Freaks has the elements for b-movie comedy silliness, the movie's flat characters and an overly silly and self-aware delivery make Eight Legged Freaks rather lame in comparison to similar films like Tremors or the previous years Ivan Reitman comedy Evolution. Most of the characters aren't engaging or memorable (barring a few exceptions) and even the spiders are done poorly with shaky CGI and poorly inserted ""noises"" for the spiders by Rob Paulsen, Kevin Michael Richardson and Frank Welker that are ill advised attempts to make the movie more zany than it is.

Although the special effects in EIGHT-LEGGED FREAKS won't break anything in the record of special effects creations, they do their job. These slime-spewing, screeching arachnids are both phony and convincing, sometimes at the same time. But they are what they are, there the behemoths that are expected from a B-movie homage called EIGHT-LEGGED FREAKS.Almost every frame of the film is devoted to those old B-movie clichés. There's the hero, an average Joe returnee named Chris McCormick (David Arquette), returning home after years of absence. He, as son of a famous mining engineer, is disappointed at how the town's (Prosperity, Arizona) economy has dropped. The mines are being closed in favor of a mall being built by the town's greedy consumerist mayor (Leon Rippy), who has also moved to a business of an ostrich farm. Chris is the town hero who leads the brigade to stop the creeping crawlers, who are by the way mutated to large size when they ingest a certain amount of nuclear wastes.What B-movie (or an homage) would be complete without the presence of the kid who discovers the danger and is never believed by those he tells. This kid is played by Scott Terra, a kid who loves spiders and freaks out when he finds one that's way bigger than the usual size. Kari Wuhrer (from ANACONDA) plays Sheriff Sam Parker, another tough fighter as well as Chris' ex-flame and Scarlett Johanssonn plays her rebellious daughter. Doug E. Doug provides the most hilarious character as an eccentric radio announcer who believes in the coming of ""them"". Eileen Ryan and Rick Overton play other townies fighting against the giant spiders.Despite the human cast, there's the real stars of the show, the giant spiders. Like dinosaurs in JURASSIC PARK or the cantina creatures in STAR WARS, these critters come in all of sorts. There are giant tarantulas, leaping spiders, trapdoor spiders and spiders the size of the latest SUV's. It's all thanks to the creative wackiness of the special effects crew. The script is also filled with wit an charm, a straight to those B-movies like THEM and TARANTULA.

60,gftbiloxi,Let The Squishing Begin,7,18 April 2005,"EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS was not well received by the critics and it did poorly at the box office--and frankly I'm surprised. Obviously we're not talking about ""deep meanings"" in reference to this film, but what it does, it does extremely well: part homage, part spoof, part horror, part comedy, and all of it a tremendous amount of fun! The film is essentially the classic 1950s ""big bug"" movie brought up to date and given a comic spin. A truck driver skids on the road and accidentally releases toxic chemicals into a pond; unfortunately, an ""exotic spider farm"" happens to be nearby, and when the spiders are contaminated by the chemicals they explode into creatures of monstrous proportions, nasty dispositions, and insatiable appetites. Cats, dogs, and even the occasional ostrich goes missing--can human victims be far behind?The cast plays expertly, and two deserve special mention: Doug E. Doug, who is hilarious as the independent radio station broadcaster obsessed with UFOs, aliens, and government cover-ups, and Eileen Ryan as the chain-smoking, drop-dead-talking Aunt Gladys. But although every one does well with their often-comic characters, the emphasis isn't on the cast: it's on special effects, sight-gags, and a traditional ""big bug"" plot played at a breakneck speed. It's all smoothly, slickly done, and the special effects are terrific without going into overkill.Now, the film is rather icky: after all, the spiders jump and bite and slurp, and when the townfolk go after them with everything from guns to pitchforks to chainsaws they also splatter in an appropriately disgusting way. Some viewers will be turned off by the black humor of the piece--particularly as it references the pets that go missing early on in the film. (I admit I winced a bit myself there!) Some viewers may be turned off by the ""ick"" factor and the violence, of which there is aplenty; others may take issue with the plot itself, which as noted is pretty traditional. But this isn't an Ingmar Bergman or Fellini film we're talking about here, and if you want a modern twist on a classic sci-fi theme, EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS is sure to please.

The time line is way too accelerated, I don't think the spiders would get so big in such a short time even toxin filled crickets? Oh well. But when the spiders get bigger it really starts to get funny. I still can not figure out what is up with the mayors teeth, they seem to be trying to look a little like a vampires but not quite. If those are his real teeth he must not be a real actor or he would have them fixed. The cat in the wall is pretty funny except that dry wall would not imprint that easy, especially with spider bodies. When Scarlett Johannson zaps mister horny with the stun gun it is well deserved, no means no. The perfume use is hilarious. The kid that is finally listened too is pretty cool. When every one who is still alive manages to get to the theater things come to a head. People die, spiders splatter, the green ichor is a bit much but hey they are mutants, right?

63,vostf,Starts out pretty good but the tongue-in-cheek ruins it,4,27 August 2014,"It is OK to make a spoof movie. I am not a great fan of these, but it is a - lazy - genre. Now I really hate it when they switch horses in midstream with tongue-in-cheek jokes taking over. You cannot sell the real stuff and its spoof at the same time.Eight-legged Freaks (not 8 legged freaks; see Goofs to see that Studios find it difficult to speak English) starts out pretty good for an horror movie. It is a well travelled road, so it is not actually original, but that is fine with me for the genre. The usual characters are in place and it is quite enjoyable to follow. Then, either it takes too long to establish the little community or it unfortunately switches from building up tension to unleashing hell. I reckon Roland Emmerich as a producer doesn't help maintaining subtlety as a motto.Once the spiders are all over the place the movie becomes a ""family horror roller-coaster"". You don't have to care for the characters anymore: it is all just for a laugh! With all those CGI spiders everywhere they simply stop being scary. Pity since there were good ideas at first to make the story real creepy. The cat fighting with a spider behind plaster walls was a great idea, but it already got stretched beyond the point of goofiness. Same for the motocross chase in the desert: fine idea which eventually turns cartoonish.The final act at the mall is a total mess. At this point every character is a puppet. Extras and background characters get killed, top-billed get to live whatever they do. Bottom line: Arac-attack/Eight-legged Freaks does not deliver on its promise of being an impressive horror movie. And it fails too as a spoof since the first part is seriously developing a scary plot.",Eight Legged Freaks

67,LebowskiT1000,See it for the special effects alone!!!,8,8 August 2002,"I'm not going to lie and say this movie has a great story, it doesn't. But, it's not supposed to have a good story, it's just supposed to be a fun movie about spiders taking over a city, is that so hard to accept? Anyhow, the story is SUPER simple and is pretty much what you can expect from the trailers. It's basically ""Arachnophobia"" on steroids!All the actors did a fine job. I've noticed that some people have complained about their acting. You have to remember that for most of the scenes in the film, the spiders weren't even there, they were put in with a computer some time after the scene was shot. So, I've got to give some props to all the actors in this film, they did a great job, and I commend them for it, David Arquette, Kari Wuhrer, Doug E. Doug, Scarlett Johansson and everyone else....And while I'm talking about the actors...this actress, Kari Wuhrer... Could they have got a more beautiful woman to play this part!? Good lord, that is one beautiful woman! And I've also got to mention Scarlett Johansson, another beautiful young woman!I haven't even mentioned the special effects yet! The special effects are worth watching the movie alone. The spiders actually look like their really running around munchin' on some people! It's really shocking how far they've come these days with computer effects! Whoever did the special effects for this film should pat themselves on the back, they did a fantastic job!As for the comedy aspect of the film: There was some good comedy and a lot of really stupid comedy! Sadly, a lot of the best jokes were given away in the trailer for this film, so don't expect this movie to be a total laugh-fest! But, laughs aside, the film was fun and enjoyable.I wouldn't recommend this film to everyone, but if the idea of a movie about huge spiders taking over a city interests you, then you might want to take a peak at this film...or if you're just a fan of cool special effects. Anyhow, If you see the movie, I hope you like it as much I do. Thanks for reading,-Chris",Eight Legged Freaks

This looked like a case where the special effects budget started to eat a big whole in the project and overwhelm the film and the director.The writer's need to find the fine line between verisimilitude and telegraphing the ending.They also made the mistake of showing scenes from ""Them"" on a television screen and make you realize how much better (and scarier) the original was without modern computer special effects.I probably would have been much better with an ""R"" rating and showed more mangling of human bodies.For fans of fifties Science Fiction, this film is almost not a waste of two hours of your life.",Eight Legged Freaks

74,the amorphousmachine,Forgettable irritating giant spider movie!,5,28 July 2003,"***MINOR SPOILERS***Contrary to popular belief, David Arquette (Scream) is capable of starring in decent films, however, this is not one of them. David Arquette stars as mining guru Chris McCormack, who has returned to his home town to take over the business. Unknown to him, a chemical spillage in another part of town has affected some guy's spider collection, so that they grow extremely huge in a short amount of time. McCormack must try and save the town-folk, as well as his estranged ex-girlfriend, Sheriff Sam Parker (Kari Wuhrer) and her two children (Scott Terra and Scarlett Johansson), from legions of hording hungry spiders before its too late.Ultimately, 'Eight Legged Freaks' is a spoof/homage on the old-school horror B-movies of the 50s that featured these giant spiders, yet it does nothing new with the material nor is it particularly funny. In the beginning of the film, young Mike Parker (Scott Terra) visits the spider-farm before they grow into fearsome creatures and the audience is introduced to various types of spiders- from jumping spiders, a spider under a trap-door, to the very fearsome spider that liquefies it's prey. In that one scene with such obvious exposition; the whole damn film is spelt out, and it was irritatingly apparent. So, it annoyed me straightaway, but I found myself bored with the storyline involving McCormack's rekindling romance with Sam Parker, where Kari Wuhrer (Thinner) lacks any chemistry. Scarlett Johansson, last seen in 'Ghost World', can do better than this film, and her character was very uninteresting. Other annoyances included the amount of time it took Sam Parker to realise her son is not making things up about giant spiders when the signs where so blatant!You'd think the film would get better when the giant spiders arise, yet the scenes with them are not that funny, rather stupid, and lack suspense. There is only one really genuinely funny scene! That being the cat scene, which is ridiculously funny yet a very guilty feeling at the same time! That, plus a couple of decent action moments, decent visual effects, saves this film from oblivion.The visual effects range from good to fairly average, but they are definitely a step up from older giant monster films. Overall, I found this an annoying experience but certainly not one of the worst from 2002. It's a just a tired formula when the cheese doesn't cut it. I don't mind cheesy movies but it has to have the characters to sustain it, and it is not an excuse for bad writing. I've had fun with other schlock horror/monster films mainly because the humour worked and the characters were decent. Or, in the case of 'Scream' (the best example), a film that had excellent characters and combined suspense with humour quite successfully. 'Eight Legged Freaks' fails to achieve anything new by revisiting the giant spider themed monsters, a fails to give audiences a creepy spider movie, and the excuse of cheesy homage doesn't still well with me especially when I only laughed at one scene. Watch 'Arachnophobia' instead to see a decent spider movie. 'Eight Legged Freaks' is boring, contrived and silly, yet a couple of decent moments and one hilarious scene gets it a passing grade.......just!**½ out of *****!",Eight Legged Freaks

77,Quebec_Dragon,Running out of juice on the last leg,5,18 March 2013,"This is a throwback/homage to old monster movies of the 50s/60s with modern special effects. The giant spiders of several different kinds were very expertly made (computer graphics mostly) and integrated perfectly with their surroundings. Even better, there was more ""interaction"" with humans than you'd usually get, because that's the hardest thing to do. Memorable moments included jumping spiders going after motocross racers in daytime, a cat vs spider fight in the walls of a house and the small town invasion by spiders itself. I thought the movie was pretty fun, inventive and better than expected until the last 30 minutes or so, from the mall probably, when it started to fizzle culminating in an anticlimactic journey in the last location.I didn't find it really scary. The realism of the spiders was a bit creepy sometimes, so it would better (or worse) if you have some kind of arachnophobia. The freakish aspect of the spiders was offset by the cartoony high-pitched sounds they made as well as the total lack of human blood visible. As for the comedic aspect, it's more fun and entertaining than actually funny. Lighting was very good, special effects were excellent, acting was below-average to average.

It must be very difficult to act with CGI, yet there are rarely, if ever, occasions when you see this cast looking even slightly lost.It may be a parody, it may be silly, but it's apparent that a lot of care went into making this, and the cast look like they're having fun - which always creates a good impression. There is nothing remarkable here, or particularly scary, but it does what it's supposed to do - entertain the audience.

Unfortunately, it's merely an entertaining one.What's wrong here? Lots of things. The first 45 minutes of the movie absolutely stink. They are slow as molasses, and introduce so many characters you can't keep track about who to care for. And when you do know who the good guys are, character development is so weak you barely *SPOILER AHEAD* feel bad about the aunt being captured by the spiders *END OF SPOILERS*.But the second half... ah.

82,BigGuy,Attack of the Giant B movie,6,19 July 2002,"A widely released B movie?  That is exactly what Freaks is and that is all that it is.  The only thing more gaping than the maws of the spiders are the holes in the plot.  Also forget about the laws of science being maintained (even after allowing for the giant spiders existence in the first place).Freaks follows the same formula as just about every B movie.  First the setup: Barrel of hazardous waste gets dumped in the lake.  Couple that with the local weirdo/scientist (who in this case feeds crickets from tainted water to spiders).  While the spiders are feeding and growing the subplots get established.  In this case evil developer type tries to con the town, romance buds between the two leads, and third a mother and daughter have problems they are trying to sort out.Second part:  The spiders are loose and hiding in the walls and other dark places where people keep sticking their hands and faces.  Inevitably the first prey are pets and people out by themselves.  Progressing to the stupid person investigating a hole or some such (truly lots of tension! heh!).Third part:  This is where the B-movie diverges from other types of movies featuring similar themes.  The rampage.  No more skulking in the walls or hiding.  No more tension or surprise attacks, just people getting eaten. People running through the streets screaming.Fourth part:  The stand.  The surviving people all band together to face the rampaging beasties.  This is also where all the subplots get tied up nice and neatly.  The end of the stand part of the movie is inevitably some incredible plan which saves the day.Fifth part:  Resolution.  Everything gets wrapped up, boy gets girl, calvary arrives as soon as they are no longer needed, etc etc.Now if a movie of this type appeals to you, by all means go see it.  If you are expecting anything more prepare for disappointment.  This is simply a classic style B movie.

83,LanceBrave,Arachnid Goofballs,8,3 November 2013,"This is going to date me. ""Eight Legged Freaks"" is the first time I can remember being excited about a movie no one else cared about. It was my first year of high school, I think. I was just far enough into my teens that my love of black and white creature features were confirmed. Someone was attempting to revive the big bug picture in 2002? Hell yeah, I was up for me. No one else was. It bombed domestically (though broke even internationally) and reviews were middling. The movie isn't quite old or endearing enough to have a cult following. If the ""Eight Legged Freaks"" fandom has to start somewhere, let it start with me.The story is basically ""Gremlins"" by way of ""Tarantula."" This is most obvious in how the film treats its threats. The giant spiders of ""Eight Legged Freaks"" are arachnid goof balls. The CGI is clearly dated but the animators and special effect guys made sure the spiders had personality. They mumble, shriek, and grumble like Killer Tomatoes. Their vocalizations are intentionally exaggerated and cartoonish. On two separate occasions, giant spiders get dragged behind moving cars. One grumbles in frustration after taking a bite out of a stuffed moose. Another jumps flat into a closed window. One spider out-boxes a boxer. Another cheers on his brothers as they rush the mall. One slides down on a rope, screaming the whole way. A shot spider swings on a thread, dousing his pals with green spider goop. One of the best spider gags involves a sneaky tent. Even a die-hard arachnophobe is more likely to laugh then scream. ""Eight Legged Freaks"" is less a modern reinvention of the classic big bug flick then a Mel Brooks parody on the subgenre. I guess some might find that to be a one-note joke but, I don't know guys, wacky giant spiders? Count me in.The film also nails the small town setting. Prosperity, Arizona is nicely isolated at times. The ensemble cast quickly gives you a sense of community. You believe that this small time is fighting for their mutual survival. The crusty old barber and near-sided janitor are equally amusing, each assign simple, entertaining personalities. Doug E. Doug finds a great home for his overtaxed comedic style as the local conspiracy radio host. His beleaguered shouts of frustration prove consistently funny. Rick Overton is also great as Deputy Pete. His reactions to the spiders are, at first, shocked confusion, later transitioning to dead-pan fear. Leon Rippy's talents are also well-suited to the conniving town mayor. Tom Noonan, uncredited and with minutes of screen time, makes an impression too. The strong character actor cast is another reason to love ""Eight Legged Freaks."" The supporting cast proves far more memorable then the leads. I'm willing to give David Arquette more slack then others. But there's no mistaking the guy for leading man material. His attempts at one-liners are especially groan-inducing. His performance works best when playing up his nervous qualities. Kari Wuhrer is never convincing as a mom or action heroine. Yeah, she looks fantastic in tight jeans and t-shirts but can hardly carry the film. She has zero chemistry with Arquette. Even Scarlett Johansson, hardly a great actress in her right, outshines the leads. (And also looks fantastic in tight t-shirts and jeans.) You can actually see elements of a more serious horror film under ""Eight Legged Freaks"" goofy exterior. A mouthful of spiders, regardless of size, is likely to make some squirm. The trapdoor spiders snatching people running across a parking lot could have been mined for real scares. Probably the biggest action set-piece in the film is the jumping spiders going after the kids on dirt bikes. This is the closest the film comes to real tension and, even then, it's awash in silly special effects. I'm not complaining, simply noting. It wouldn't surprise me if this started life as a more serious screenplay.The script is decently constructed. You can tell that the cigarettes, stun gun, and underground gas veins will be important later. I still appreciate the effort to set them up. I also appreciate the horror in-jokes, ""Them"" on TV, the mall invasion finale, the Hockey Mask/Chainsaw combo. The Micky-Mousing score is probably the only thing about the movie I don't like. That's the only overly jokey element. Even then, incorporating a low-pitched version of ""Itsy Bitsy Spider"" was clever. An early scene where a spider and a cat wrestle inside a wall probably goes on too long and reaches too hard for the kind of silly laughs the rest of the movie has no problem with. ""Eight Legged Freaks"" is still underrated and underseen. This surprises me. I can think of many horror fans who would love its goofy charms.",Eight Legged Freaks
84,Pavel-8,Gleefully campy.,7,15 June 2003,"In the grand tradition of ""Gremlins"" and ""Tremors,"" this movie drives full-steam ahead into the satirical horror movie genre. 
The key to this movie's success is the tone, which is set from the onset by the title alone.  Some movies are unintentionally humorous, but ""Eight Legged Freaks"" is plainly and gleefully tongue-in-cheek, as it pokes fun at nearly every horror movie cliche.  I think the tone is also set in large part by the score.  From the opening shots, the music is playful and screams B-movie.  Once you recognize the campy attitude, you can rachet down any serious expectations and enjoy the show.    The story can be summed up in two words.  Spiders attack.  And do they ever. Once the necessary but lame stage-setting is done with, the spiders arrive to provide the movie's best visuals, attacking with excessive violence that spawns laughter with every aggressive movement.  That's not necessarily surprising.  What is surprising is the humor the spiders provide.  From attacking a stuffed deer head to being dragged behind the bumper of a car, the anthropomorphic arachnids achieve a higher level of comedy than any actor in the movie.  Many of the spiders are computer-generated, often obviously so.  But I think this is intentional, adding to the campiness. The sounds effects also enhance the feel of the movie. Often they are cartoonish, as the spiders giggle (seriously), squeal, liquify, and go splat.  Just the sheer size of the spiders is hilarious too, particularly when they engulf their human prey.  The acting is nothing to speak of, everyone is suitable, but no one stands out.  In contrast to most movies, the humans are the props here, just people for the spiders to 'act' against.  When the people do act, they're usually lapsing into horror movie cliches, such as poking their heads into dark places and running off alone to save the town.  These norms are combined with some freshness, which presents itself most blatantly in a X-Games scene in which the giant spiders chase down teenagers on dirtbikes.  Fun stuff.Better to see than relate, ""Eight Legged Freaks"" is something that hasn't been done well lately, a B-movie that knows it's a B-movie. Not great, but highly entertaining.Bottom Line:  Everything one could want from this type of movie.  You'll laugh; you'll wince; you'll enjoy. 7 of 10.",Eight Legged Freaks

Also I noticed when the spiders were attacking the mall one of the spiders up on the ledge was waving them in - like a commander. I thought this was funny - like lots of other things in the movie.In my book, Tremors comes first, but Eight Legged Freaks gives it a run for it's money and is the second best sci-fi/comedy spoof i've seen.8.7/10By the way, if you don't like spiders you probably shouldn't see it.",Eight Legged Freaks

There are several laughs (""Bob?"") based on dialogue, stunts, and critter noises, but pay close attention to the music (who notices the music ? YOU should!) and John Ottman's score will give you an extra humor dimension (listen for a familiar children's melody in minor mode). This is so much better than the 50s giant spider movies it nods to, with the CGI effets only looking a little phony once. It IS violent, too much for any small fry, but teens and up should be able to keep the flee/pounce/slurp in perspective. A little, er, dead in spots, but picks up steam once the BEMs go on the attack.Frankly, I wouldn't wait to see this on video/DVD.

The special effects were well done and the acting was a lot better than I expected from a movie starring Kari Wurher, who has always been a pathetic actress (until this movie).

91,TheSeaLion,Fails to meet even the lowest of expectations,1,12 January 2019,"It's not like I was expecting anything more than some superficial entertainment from a movie entitled ""Eight Legged Freaks;"" I thought it would be dumb but fun action flick that was self-aware of what it was and wanted to be. Instead, ""Eight Legged Freaks"" not only doesn't reach that low bar, but it also has almost zero successes in it.""Eight Legged Freaks"" feels in a way like it wants to be Joe Dante's 1984 classic ""Gremlins."" It is a dark comedy with hints of horror to it set in a small town with a colorful cast of characters that gets attacked by monsters. It's a fairly straight forward premise, but ""Eight Legged Freaks"" manages to fail with every single one of these details.Dark comedy with hints of horror: That should have been the tone that this movie goes for (""Arachnophobia"" with Jeff Daniels did that right), but it instead goes for a comedic tone that one of those ""Scary Movie"" spoof films would have. This dissolves the tension and the creepiness in every scene the spiders are in.Colorful cast of characters: There is definitely a variety of characters in the movie, but none that we really get to know. There are a couple of background townsfolk who are a bit prominent, but they have no quirks or traits to make the audience care about them. The secondary characters are annoying and unlikable, so who cares what happens to them? The leads played by David Arquette and Kari Wuhrer are dull, boring, and have no chemistry together. Arquette is pretty good at hamming up his scenes, but that is the most likability that is displayed by a singular character. Then there are a lot of characters who just feel like they've had chunks of their stories and arcs removed, creating characters that behave strangely and make choices that are illogical to what has been established. For example, when everyone is trapped in a mall, the mayor (Leon Rippy) decides to use a hidden exit to escape without telling anyone else, and subsequently locks that exit so no one can follow. While the mayor has been established as a bit selfish, trapping people to die is a bit far and out of character.With these two major components to what the movie is trying to be utterly failing, ""Eight Legged Freaks"" is already in poor standing, which is made worse by the insufferable script.The movie at least knows to provide set-up and payoff for the things that happen, so it could at least pass a screenwriting 101 class, but the payoffs are so dumb that it just becomes aggravating. Take for example a motorcycle that one character uses to escape the arachnids. The character takes the bike with him everywhere he goes, despite how illogical it is, so it can be used in the final action piece of the movie.""Eight Legged Freaks"" is a dumb but not fun action flick that has zero self-awareness and has no idea what it is doing or what it wants to be.",Eight Legged Freaks

95,tstudstrup,Dumb/horrible cgi,1,28 October 2016,"I love creature movies. But this is just too brain dead. The spiders are extremely bad cgi. Even for a 14 year old movie. They clearly didn't have the money to make it believable. And yeah I know what you're gonna say: it's a movie about giant spiders. But even giant spiders can be believable if they get the CGI right. Like for instance the piranhas in Pirahna 3D. Or get the suits right. In Aliens, it was men in suits and puppets. And it's way more believable than this crap. A movie made 16 years before this when there was no cgi. It's also a matter of having a fun or scary story with decent acting. This movie has neither. David Arquette is a terrible actor. He plays the exact same character as he did in Scream. If he had to act in order to save his own life, he would die. This movie should have killed his career, like it pretty much killed the directors career. Watch it for they eye candy. Kahri Wuhrer and a very young and still unknown Scarlett Johansson as a mother and daughter I would love to have a threesome with. But hey, it's not even worth watching it for them. Just watch porn instead. The acting isn't much better here and at least they screw in porn. This movie didn't even break even as far as budget versus box office goes. Had this been a movie from a small studio and not Fox, it would have bankrupted them. But hey on the plus-side it didn't kill Johanssons career. And was it not for this movie Pirahna 3D wouldn't have been made as it clearly is inspired from this but made much more convincing with a cast of famous actors, but with a budget 6 million dollars smaller than this movie. Avoid this!! Even boys from age 10 to 15, will hate this, because of the horrible cgi.",Eight Legged Freaks
96,tord-1,Great little spider film!,7,18 July 2011,"This is one of those films that you can see over and over, and finding new things to enjoy. The story is simple, and similar to many other horror films, where insects/spiders for some reason become unnaturally big and prey on man. Great spiders, good acting, not that bad dialog, and a lot of humor.Many films in this class take themselves totally serious (like the abysmal Alien vs Zombies), which this does not - a big plus in my book. That a Taser should be able to fire up an entire electrical grid (if small), is just about the only total slip-up - the rest is fairly good in both continuity and SFX. Some guy is waving an unloaded crossbow at the spiders, and still he can fire it, and nobody collects any fired bolts (the missiles a crossbow is bolts, not arrows), also quite questionable.Well worth watching, and great fun!",Eight Legged Freaks

In a way it looks upon its predecessors with the same irony and awe that the 1970es sadly underrated ""beware the Blob"" had for its cult original.So unless you are averse to the genre or have arachnophobia, this is guaranteed enjoyment with the right mix of laughs and jump scares.Oh and the most far fetched thing too, you also have Scarlett Johansson playing a teenager while actually being a teenager.",Eight Legged Freaks

102,A_Roode,It's called 'Eight Legged Freaks.' What did you expect?,7,12 March 2006,"Certainly there were any number of reasons for me to not like 'Eight Legged Freaks' before I watched it. I'm not a spider guy so I wasn't really interested in the first place. As far as actors go, I can't stand David Arquette. Generally I find him aggravating in the extreme and his characters highly unlikeable -- but more on that in a moment. And to paraphrase Val Lewton about his own RKO films: ""It's hard for critics to give positive reviews to films called 'I Walked With a Zombie.'""At the time of this review's writing, the film has a rating on the IMDb of 5.5/10. I'm actually quite surprised by that because despite my own personal biases, the film proved me wrong. I had no level of expectation for it and really no desire to watch it in the first place. I was wrong and I admit it. It was truly funny with some great sight gags and lines. There are definitely some decent scares and a pretty competent job of raising the level of tension in the film to a steady and consistent level. David Arquette surprised me and this might be the best performance he's ever put in. My personal bias against him was dead wrong in this movie.'Eight Legged Freaks' is a throw back to creature films of the 50's and, as some other reviewers have alluded, to more contemporary films like 'Gremlins' and 'Tremors.' Horror-comedy is a difficult genre to work within but 'Eight Legged Freaks' manages to pull it off. The acting all around is good. A lot of the film is satirical (Doug E Doug's conspiracy guy) and the cgi is so obvious and over the top that, while it might be aggravating in a movie that took itself more seriously, you can't help but admire and respect the results.That really is the strength of the movie -- it doesn't take itself as seriously as a lot of its critics did. 'Eight Legged Freaks' does what the best films should do: for two hours you forget you're watching a movie and you just enjoy yourself. I hope that time will be kind and maybe people will come around and give the movie another chance. Had this film taken itself seriously we would have ended up with a spider version of 'Bats.' This version and its self-deprecation are much worthier of your time.",Eight Legged Freaks
103,Charles-31,Where have all the chiche's gone?,3,28 July 2002,"One thing I have never cared much for is the movie cliché.  You know, evil twins and the like.  You've seen them many, many times.  And, horror movies have more than their fair share.  Let's split up.  Invincible monsters that cannot be destroyed.   Just stick your head into that hole.  The inevitable ""bad guy who's only out for himself"".  Telegraphing the means of your salvation to the audience.  ""Nobody believes me!""  The brilliant kid nobody will listen to.  The rebellious daughter.  Television series die from their inclusion.  Movies such as Hollow Man resort to them because they have no original ideas.  In general, they are a sign of awful film making.Interestingly enough, Eight Legged Freaks appears to have spent considerable effort cataloging the horror/monster genre cliché's in an effort to get them into one film all at once, and that they do so admirably.  No, the movie is not very good.  The acting is awful, there is NOTHING you can't predict, the heroes can escape any hazard, and the extras are toast.  But, just the amazing completeness of the cliché catalog makes this movie worth not only watching, but worthy of detailed study by a film researcher.  They have them all, some more than once.  Had I spent weeks working on a checklist, I could have checked them all off as present and accounted for during this film. So, be sure to see this film, though I don't recommend actually giving them money.  Wait for it to be on cable TV.  If Mystery Science Theatre ever returns, that would be the perfect forum for it.This movie has another interesting characteristic that is worth pointing out.  I first noticed this characteristic in the old Stephen King movie Maximum Overdrive.  It's what I call the surrender to comedy trend.  About half way through Eight Legged Freaks you can tell that the director has given up on making anything remotely resembling a horror movie.  The rushes have demonstrated that attempts at fright are coming out dumb or humorous. So, they give up.  It happened in Maximum Overdrive and it's happened here. They decided to make a comedy.  They try to cover it up a bit, but it doesn't work very well.  You know that they know they failed and are trying to salvage what they can.  I did expect one thing that would have been fun in this movie, but did not happen.  I fully expected the ending (after everyone is happy) to exhibit the ominous shadow of a very large rabbit.",Eight Legged Freaks
104,Rooster99,Excellent! A terrific Horror-Comedy! One of the best in years!,7,15 November 2002,"I have been disappointed with most horror movies I have seen recently (what do I expect, they are horror movies after all), however this one is terrific!  The spiders are nasty, the characters take the spider-attack seriously rather than going for stupid one-liners as their friends are being dragged away, the enemy is merciless, and the comedy is right on queue.The special effects are very impressive, not once did I think that I was looking at a miniature or CGI spider.  I particularly liked the scene with the motorbikes in the desert and the jumping spiders, it was extremely well done.  After a long string of B-movies, Kari Wuhrer proves she can carry a lead role.  OK, it is not Gone with the Wind, but she is tough, she acts well, and you never get the feeling she was given the role solely on her looks (probably true, however she played her character well).  For instance, if you compared her role against the acting of Heidi Schanz in Universal Soldier : The Return, you would give Kari Wuhrer an Oscar.  She never succumbs to lame one-liners, her worry over her children's safety appears genuine, and she is believable in a last-stand-against-the-enemy situation.I loved this movie!  Definitely one for the DVD collection.  Do not go see this movie if you are expecting another Citizen Kane, however at least the title will give you a pretty good idea of what to expect.  It was much, much better than I thought it was going to be.  Even the little Harry Potter know-it-all 12-year old didn't bother me!  He tries to tell the adults about the spiders once, but immediately says, ""I'm a kid, and they never believe the kid.""  He knows how most B-movie horror movies work!The arrival at the end of the movie of the police from another district is classic!  ""Cocoons?  We got cocoons?

105,Old Crow-2,"Arachnophobia rocks, this one doesn´t.",4,17 April 2003,"I saw Arachnophobia when I was a kid and I remember it giving me creeps. I´ve always been to all kinds of weird creatures (I study biology and I love snakes, lizards, spiders...) and that´s why I found this little movie exciting. Whether all that could possibly happen wasn´t important at all, I was a kid! I´d sure love to see the good old Arachnophobia again, just to see if it´s still enjoyable. In the meantime I decided to check a movie called Eight-Legged Freaks which couldn´t be titled Arac Attack because the word Arac reminds every American of Iraq... That´s just so stupid, but back to my review...Eight-Legged Freaks was a very mediocre movie. It´s not a movie that´ll be remembered because it has nothing it could be remembered for. Sure, those spiders look nice (I guess they´re supposed to look a little fake), but they are neither scary nor funny and I suppose they were meant to be both. Those tiny killer spiders in that good old Arachnophobia were a lot scarier because they were more realistic.Eight-Legged Freaks lacks a real momentum and it runs out of steam after one hour. The plot is as simple as it could possibly be and you couldn´t care less about the characters. Since this is a part-comedy the characters are meant to be funny, but compared to John Goodman´s exterminator in that older spider movie I´ve mentioned so many times they don´t come even close to being funny. There are some amusing moments, but after sometime all that trying becomes very tiresome. I won´t say anything about the cast because there really isn´t anything to say.If you want to see this movie turn your brain off for 90 minutes and try to enjoy the ride. Perhaps this movie just wasn´t for me. It just made me miss Arachnophobia even more.",Eight Legged Freaks
106,rbsjrx,Amazingly entertaining,8,27 July 2008,"Arachnophobia is one of the most common phobias, and one of the strongest among those subject to it. I tend to be one of those and so have never much enjoyed horror films featuring giant or menacing spiders. To my surprise, I was never particularly uncomfortable during ""Eight Legged Freaks"". This and ""Arachnophobia"" are my two favorite spider films.This is a horror-comedy, a genre that's difficult to pull off effectively. What makes it work are the personalities (sic!) of the spiders. They're not unlike the title characters in ""Gremlins"" (another favorite) as they gleefully go about, rampaging and wreaking havoc among the humans (it's worth noting that the film never actually shows anyone meeting their gruesome death nor do any of the humans you come to know actually die). And that's the key - although these spiders are physically typical of their kind, their actions have been anthropomorphized to make them much less creepy. Just as in ""Gremlins"", they've been given voices - which ""real"" giant spiders undoubtedly wouldn't have. The human actors, while uniformly competent are consistently upstaged by the CGI spiders. Also, like ""Gremlins"", the small town setting is populated by a collection of eccentrics, which only helps. The plot is just a device on which to hang the action and comedy.

It doesn't try to portray itself as a high tech, knock your socks off horror or thriller. It's a portrayal of the '50s genre of horror. As Slapsticky as that was, this is as well, in a sense. The spiders look pretty realistic, if you ask me. Of course, they squeak and sputter nonsensical stuff, kind of like the little gremlins did in the 1984 Gremlins, or like Critters. It's a good popcorn, leave your brain at home, make sure to buy a matinee movie ticket type of flick. But heck, it's a lot of fun! This is one of David Arquette's better movies to date.

This film also features Scarlett Johansson (The Horse Whisperer, Ghost World), Scott Terra (Daredevil), Kari Wuhrer (Anaconda), Doug E. Doug (Cosby, Jungle Fever), Rick Overton (Mrs. Doubtfire, Groundhog Day) as you can tell, these actors aren't just fresh off the street. It does have somewhat of a B-Movie feel to it, but the spiders don't look low budget. The acting isn't anything to spectacular, but it's good enough to make it effective.

115,walkingwithprimeval,Scarlett Johansson's original Black Widow film,6,19 June 2020,"If you're looking for a more serious monster movie to watch, then you might be sorely disappointed by this one. However, if you're just craving to have some senseless B-movie goodness, then look no further. The film's executive producers were none other than Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, the notoriously bad-filmmaking duo who brought us the spectacular flop that was TriStar's Godzilla-In-Name-Only, amongst other such schlock (knowing that much, it seems like they've finally managed to get something done right for once in their lives).The movie's roots hearken back to when the sci-fi boom of the '50s kicked off a whole decade's worth of cheesy creature features, wherein a regular-sized animal would almost always get mutated by some form of nuclear radiation or toxic waste and rapidly grow to a ginormous stature, all thanks to a mad scientist's experiment gone horribly wrong. In fact, this was directly based on director Ellory Elkayem's effects-heavy short film Larger Than Life (1997), which payed tribute to that particular period in Hollywood's history.In retrospect, this film honestly seems more like a goofy comedy than a scary horror movie. I'm guessing the behind-the-scenes crew were very well aware of this and in on the joke, which is probably why they went so far as to add in little vocalisations of the spiders making daft cartoony noises (no spiders have vocal cords in real-life) during the post-production's phase of sound-editing, to help ensure that the audience understood the silly tone they were going for and that they got the point across about it having a tongue-in-cheek quality feeling (that being said, if my childhood memory serves me correctly, I do remember a few of the earlier scenes had some genuinely creepy moments in them before everything quickly devolved into all-out monster madness).The only downside to all of this is the fact that the computer-generated arachnids themselves don't really hold up too well when compared to today's CGI visuals. They may have looked good for their time back in 2002 but as the years have passed on by, you can just tell they've aged poorly in certain shots. Even so, I suppose you could make the argument that its outdated digital graphics only enhances your further amusement of rewatching it again as they do have an odd charm to them (sort of like the case with the 1995 miniseries adaptation of Stephen King's The Langoliers novella, although not nearly anywhere as drastic as that one was).A nice attention to detail, I noticed they sneakily included an instrumental rendition of the traditional Incy Wincy Spider nursery rhyme, which was woven into the background music of John Ottman's orchestral score (and not to mention, they also had a swingy version of the actual song itself which was performed by Joey DeLuxe with some extra lyrics, who made it pretty catchy).Yes, Eight Legged Freaks is kind of dumb in a few places here and there. But it's the best type of bad movie there is; a fast-paced and entertaining one. It's supposed to be nothing more than nonsensical, stupid fun which you really shouldn't take all that seriously. Besides, it's still miles better than any cheap little made-for-TV thing you'd often see playing on the Syfy channel (and at the very least, it's also a step above those tremendously awful direct-to-DVD rip-off flicks by The Asylum). Just sit back and enjoy the wild ride because this is the ultimate early-2000s cheese-fest!Oh yeah, and the human cast were all pretty OK too (with some of them even hamming up their already overacted performances, a bit).",Eight Legged Freaks

Since ELF was the only one playing in my time slot, I went in. Despite Ebert's glowing review, my expectations were low.Lucky. Eight Legged Freaks is not a great movie, and it's barely good. However, there is enough campish self-awareness to make it fun (in the ""Tremors"" tradition) and the characters are pleasant enough. The story is exactly what you'd expect, and nothing is particularly surprising, although there are a couple of genuinely funny moments that you'll recognize when you see them.If you want something light, and you can get it cheap, then ELF is okay.

As it was, there was no mystery after about 30 minutes.  The ""plot"" was full of holes and the writing was stilted at best.  There were a few decent lines, but by and large, if there weren't more fun with the spider chases and the spiders inflicting violence on everything and anything, this movie would have blown, big time.  Still, like I said, I liked it for the sense that it seemed to have, even in the advertising, that it was gonna be a classic B movie.

We are introduced to a kid who is obsessed by spiders and pays regular visits to the owner of the local exotic spider farm.  During one visit, it is revealed how the toxic waste has given rise to fauna which when fed to the spiders causes the arachnids to grow at an alarming rate.  Pay attention to this bit as the titbits of information relating to spider behaviour provided by the owner will all be put to use later on in the film! 
It doesn't take long before the giant spiders get hungry and threaten the lives of both local residents and pets.  Led by the local Sheriff (who happens to be the mother of the aforementioned spider-obsessed kid) and Chris McCormack (David Arquette), the people of Arizona fight back. 
David Arquette makes for a likeable and slightly goofy hero but one feels that the romantic sub-plot has just been thrown in.  The Sheriff is far too foxy to be convincing in the role and as is often the case in these monster-type movies, the kids often appear unphased. The 12 certificate prevents the film from being too gory but the special effects are realistic enough to make the skin of anyone with any hint of arachnophobia crawl.  Eight Legged Freaks' is definitely played for laughs rather than scares which are often predictable with pets and grannies going down dark holes they really shouldn't be going down!  The finale is pure mayhem with the whole town being forced to fight back with guns and chainsaws as well as other more inappropriate weapons.It is unlikely that anyone will be going into this film expecting anything other than a simplistic, silly and totally implausible storyline but I did have a lot of fun watching it.",Eight Legged Freaks

Let's discuss the IMDB's qualification:**Spoilers**ACTION: Well, the movie is more action than anything else I give it that. You'll see a bunch of big CG spiders doing stupid noises, jumping around and killing people throughout the movie. The final sequence shows a Humans vs Spiders scenario in which you know who will win and lasts way more than it should. Pretty typical for this kind of movies and doesn't delivers anything knew for that matter.COMEDY: It's easy to do a story when its main story is something stupid. I don't know why people think of this movie as funny since there are so many better ""comedy-horror"" movies out there. Nothing here was new, nothing here was funny, it was more of a pathetic failed effort to do a comedy. The movie was supposed to be stupid and funny, but stupid is as far as it gets.HORROR: Unless you have a very serious case of arachnophobia and you are truly disturbed by big, more-than-obvious CG spiders that make stupid noises, then, the only thing that will truly horrify you, is how bad this movie is.SCI-FI: When the need comes for a writer to do a stupid movie with giant spiders, then the story becomes something that can be completely ignored and on which the smallest the effort made for an original, interesting story, the happier everyone is. Who cares how the spiders got there!?? People want giant spiders, people want stupidity and that's it! No much thought required here.  **Spoilers End**Watch this movie only if you are completely bored and with nothing to do (like I was at the moment I saw it).

136,humpback,best popcorn yet this summer,8,15 August 2002,"Eight Legged Freaks (ELF) is _not_ shakesspearean Artistry. Neither does it have perfect Artistry in the fields of imagery, camerawork or great, epic dialogue. Admitted and put down in writing. If you absolutely want to see something in that vein, buy a ticket for the next Kurosawa movie.  THIS IS POPCORN  - and good one at that !Beyond those high brow criticisms, ELF surely is one of the fastest, wittiest (wackiest, too ) and at times even scary movies to hit the screen this summer (which has been full of disappointments, sigh).It basically is a vintage 50ies insectoid monster flick plot (lone desert town, weird accident turning local insects into frightening monstrosities...you get the drift) , told with 21st century (sometimes breathless) pace, great FX spiders (sure you can do even better, but this is not ""Spiderman""), some smart (and some rather cynic) dialogue and a lot of cool moments, especially for people who are watching more than one movie a year (and therefore do actually ""get"" the asides ). And yes, like every good monster flick it requires some suspension of disbelief. Lets say this again - this is POPCORN !It's not as bloody as one may fear (most violence and imaginably gross moments happen just ""off-camera""), and less likely to produce sleepless nights than 'Arachnophobia', although the bodycount _is_ high, and it starts piling on fast, once the all out ""arac attack"" starts rolling. That's ok though, because long-term character development and intense, heart rending dialogue were left out of the script - but who expects them in a B-category monster flick, anyway ? On the other hand, you get lots of great laughs (the ""catfight"" is especially funny - ok, not for felinophiles, so what ?) and one can simply lean back and enjoy the ensuing mayhem and carnage in sweet Prosperity..... Expect people and spiders to die great numbers and many interesting and surprising ways.Two minor quibbles should be noted - ELF has the minor problem of too few heroes to root for. David Arquette falls apallingly short as the ""hero protagonist"" - probably that's why he was affordable - while the less known Kari Wuhrer is far better ( in terms of onscreen presence and simple charisma), but does get neither enough room nor heroic opportunities. The rest of the cast simply features noone to really cheer on, either.Second, the final ""endmob"" spider is IMHO simply not scary and convincing enough , not to comment on the less than exciting and slightly illogical way of her dispatching ( combustion engines.... lets repeat this once more, _combustion_ engines...     frankly, some more money and script reworking should have been spend on this sequence - had it been available, it would have been, I guess ). But besides this, the movie is an utterly enjoyable treat if one does like monster movies at all .

138,StevePaget,Not nearly as good as it should have been.,4,13 December 2004,"1990's Arachnophobia was a great little film. It was scary, with lots of good creepy shocks, but it was aimed firmly at a family audience, with lots of humour and some good acting. Eight Legged Freaks tries to bring the killer spider genre into the new century by adding oodles of CGI. It's how 50's B movies would have looked if they had had the budget and the technology.The idea is very simple. There's an accident involving the sort of dangerous bio-waste which is always being carted around in rickety trucks in cheap horror movies. Via a rather convoluted path, the mutation-causing goo ends up affecting hundreds of spiders which are being reared in a nearby exotic spider farm (doesn't every small town have one?). The movie takes great pains to introduce us to the characteristic of the different spider species through the clever narrative device of an annoyingly clever child who knows a lot about spiders. Jumping spiders, trapdoor spiders, ""orb-weavers"", they're all explained in depth so that we will recognise them later in the movie and go ""ooh, that's that one which makes trap doors"". What do they think we are, stupid?Actually, the film-makers must think that we are very stupid, because they somehow think it is necessary to keep mentioning the fact that the mines beneath the town are FULL OF METHANE, and the characters must be very careful because METHANE is dangerous and the mines are FULL OF METHANE. I'd be amazed if anyone who ever saw this film was surprised by the ending. (Clue: it involves methane)The problem with Eight Legged Freaks is that it is bound to appeal to almost no one. As a horror movie it is too silly. As a comedy it is not sufficiently funny. As a family movie it is too frightening. The spiders kill loads of people (which is cool), but they make little squeaky noises like the Mogwai from Gremlins (which is stupid). Worse is the use of cartoon-style violence, totally out of place in a film trying to appeal to anyone over ten years old. On more than one occasion a spider jumps and splats into a wall before slowly sliding down. Really poor.Though it may lack the big beasties, Arachnophobia still beats Eight Legged Freaks by a long way and remains king of the spider films.",Eight Legged Freaks

From the trailer, it even looked like the CGI effects were good. And to top it off, it featured Kari Wuhrer, one of my favourite TV actresses (from the series Sliders). But what can I say - sometimes even the best ingredients can produce a terrible movie. The creature CGI effects were third-rate, nearly all of the jokes fell flat, it was afflicted with extremely poor editing (obvious scene deletions which befuddle the flow of the movie), and all of the major characters were one dimensional. Arquette and Wuhrer obviously have no enthusiasm for the roles, and deliver lackluster performances. The side characters who are supposed to be quirky and engaging instead all just come off like annoying idiots. The best I could say for this movie is that it might be worth a watch on TV if you've really got nothing (and I mean nothing) else to do.

It may not have incredible acting, serious drama or anything that would set it in the bounds of a well-produced film, but its nicely directed action sequences, quick scene changes combined with the clever usage of many minor characters to create lots of scenarios makes it immensely enjoyable to watch. I had as much fun watching this as I did Goodfellas or Terminator. It didn't get a 9 because it isn't snazzy in the stylish sense, but quite frankly its comical outlook and lighthearted approach to a tired genre was very refreshing, i enjoyed every minute of it.If you're looking for an easy night in with something to entertain all ranges, this is definately it.

A strange looking man is then seen collecting small bugs from the lakes edge. Unbeknownst to him, the bugs have been contaminated with the waste. It turns out that he owns an exotic spider farm and is feeding the bugs to the spiders which is making the spiders grow larger than normal.When one of the spiders escapes from its' glass cage all hell breaks loose with quite a nerve shredding scene that is also quite funny at times. Freaks then progresses at lighting speed as the spiders grow to monstrous proportions with some well handled action sequences and some good comic moments to boot. Even the spiders are given a sense of humour.
As the film only lasts a short time, the main bulk of the plot is in the first ten minutes with the remaining ninety being used for the action. During that time we get a low down on the different characters in the film. There is the usual bad guy who is only looking out for number one, you've got the guy who has been away for years and conveniently comes back at the right time and the usual annoying teenagers who are just gagging to be killed. Oh and there is the love interest too.This is your usual popcorn movie that doesn't require you to have a degree in rocket science to follow. Eight Legged Freaks has all you could ask for in a big budget B-movie with great special effects and cheesy acting. Just leave your brain at the door and you'll enjoy it whole lot more.",Eight Legged Freaks

But that doesn't mean it doesnt deserve that, it does. Anyway this film was just really entertaining and I loved it, it was really funny and people are complaining about the acting, but it wasn't that bad, I mean most of the time they would have to be running for thier lives, it's not one of those really emotional movies where the acting has to be perfectly into what thier doing, it's still got quite good actors/actresses in it anyway, including David Arquette, Scott terra, and scarlett johansson. Anyway its really good and I could watch it over and over again and it wouldn't get old, see it it's really cool, 9 out of 10Francesca Orr",Eight Legged Freaks
147,bootderek,Gone is the gore,4,30 October 2008,"OK, some pretty good special effects are put into this film. The spiders are well-animated and well-choreographed. The casting is OK, but there's some poorly dramatic moments with most of the characters. Doug E. Doug did an OK job as a neurotic radio guy. The main problem with this movie is that there's no proper horror involved. I mean sure, some little deaths were gruesome like the ostrich scene. But just about every step of the way, there is no gore included like in the original giant spider movies (or any other horror movie for that matter). The little spiders (ok maybe all the spiders) made sounds that didn't even sound spider-like. That was an annoying part. Some of the characters were just plain stupid to begin with and are poorly introduced. Another thing that I found most perplexing is that they don't give a proper description of the chemical that caused the growth stunts. They brought in a rendition of George A. Romero's version of the film ""Dawn Of The Dead"", which I found to be fine as long as nobody's going off on their own (surprisingly, that didn't stick). I feel that instead of just a big, bad female orb weaver spider as one of the main focuses, maybe they could have brought in a BLACK WIDOW, or maybe just a bunch of colossal tarantulas. The humor, drama, action, and horror were all very poorly done, and the script was average. I mean, come on. I expected horror, as in ""supposedly non-stop action, gore, and guns"". That's the horror genre that I know. I can accept that they mixed extreme humor with horror in the Scary Movie series, but in a giant spider movie? 4/10",Eight Legged Freaks

Doug, the town boy who has just returned to be the hero played by the ever excellent David Arquette who is the most perfectly cast B-Movie actor EVER! and the really hot sherriff who is in love with the hero and vice versa, a great film, some ropey effects on occasion but it only adds to the brilliant and fantastic B-Movie feel of a truly great and memorable movie i hope more movies like this come along and quickly!",Eight Legged Freaks
149,zh84,Don't watch if you have any attachment to science or the facts,3,4 July 2006,"I admit I'm writing this review after seeing only the first half-hour of the film on TV; I may not be able to stand much more. Yes, I know it's just for fun, but even in a horror comedy it really would be better if they paid SOME attention to the facts. In particular, whoever is responsible for the sound effects - a whole bunch of them, according to the listing - needs to be spanked. Spiders do not make noises; I'm pretty sure they're deaf. They do not growl, chatter, yap, squeak or gurgle. Hunting animals which depend on creeping up on their prey generally aren't noisy, for obvious reasons. The annoying little boy, who is supposed to be an expert on spiders, identifies the thing he retrieves from the old man's house as a ""pedipalp"" or ""a spider's leg"". Pedipalps are not legs - in fact, they're part of the spider's anatomy that it uses for mating! If you put this into human terms, you can see it's a pretty major mistake ;-) Finally, we have the grand cliché of the Big Company/Big Government Conspiracy: how many films have we seen where They are the ultimate source of the problem? In a film which throws away all kinds of facts in favour of ""imagination"", they could have been more imaginative!",Eight Legged Freaks
150,mkools,One of the worst movies ever.,2,20 October 2002,"My expectations were high after seeing the trailer. They were even higher when i saw the movie had the same director as independance day and godzilla. The special effects in independence day were much better then in this movie. The whole movie I was waiting for the spiders to show up. The rest of the storyline was really boring. And when the spiders came, they had a very amateuristic look, like the special effects were from a movie made in the 60's. I didn't watch the whole movie. When it was played for about one hour I switched off my DVD-player. I watch 3 movies almost every night, and I have never walked away from a movie, even if it was that boring. The only thing good in this movie was the pretty sheriff :) That's why I voted 2 instead of 1 :) So don't go see this one, instead you should go out and rent Starship Troopers, it's like the same only 10.000 times better.",Eight Legged Freaks
151,phil0011,Creepy and funny,6,13 February 2004,"6/10Monster movies are few and far between nowadays. The B-movie is dying. It's a shame, because if they were all as entertaining as this we'd all be queuing up to see them. Not since the masterpiece of Tremors in 1990 has a truly good B- movie come along. We've had the nauseatingly dull and overblown Congo andAnaconda and although we did get the spectacular Independence Day, it wasnever really a monster movie. Now along comes Eight Legged Freaks  anhomage to the monster movies of the fifties and a satire on the more recent films of this nature. Lines such as, `Come on we got to go! We got to get out of here! They're coming!' and `They're not aliens they're spiders mutated bycontaminated waste!' don't particularly work if you take them seriously. And this is where I think a lot of people stumble when they come to view Eight LeggedFreaks. They take it in as though we're still living in the fifties and monster movies were supposed to be taken seriously. Gremlins started it, Tremorsperfected it and now Eight Legged Freaks is poking fun at it.Ellory Elkayem, the director, has a lot of fun playing around with the clichés and the actors do a fine job of not over acting. Surprisingly the director is able to handle both the laughs and the scares with an equal amount of adeptness. It's a fine and intelligent piece of direction, which you don't often see in Dean Devlin/ Roland Emmerich pictures.It's difficult to criticise a film like this  one that is continually having a laugh at itself. And while I chuckled throughout and was occasionally creeped out byspiders the size of cars lurking, biting and enveloping; the film never seemed to rise above its self-referential humour. If the benchmark is Tremors, then this never lived up to it. By the time the final last stand takes place you've become a little tired and the ending is much welcomed.But don't be too put off  this is charming, light-hearted, funny, and occasionally scary stuff. Although there are better films of a similar genre out there this can be pigeonholed into `perfect popcorn fodder for a dreary Saturday night.'",Eight Legged Freaks
152,anaang,great,9,30 July 2002,"this is a great movie for the sci-fi channel on Saturday afternoons. I loved the fact that they payed homage to all the great ""horror""films of days of old.

153,Mr_Jackhammer,100% pure fun! Yeah baby!!!,10,9 November 2002,"This movie is definitely one of the best monster shows ever.  It has everything.  Excitement, suspense, humor, shoot 'em up action and even good ol' fashioned swatting on a large scale.  The movie may not be the most scientifically accurate film in the world, but it doesn't try to be, and that's not the point of the show.  Personally I haven't seen too many mutated giant spiders listed in the encyclopedias, so there really isn't any real world example to compare them to as far as behavior patterns or markings etc. etc...  Taking this movie at face value, I paid my money, went into a theater expecting a lousy piece of excrement like ""Rats"" and I was completely taken aback.  I went in prepared to give ELF a bad rap, and I was so impressed that I now own it on DVD.  The acting is actually GOOD, something that is very rare in this genre.  The movie has lots of action, but it never degenerates into the typical ""run run scream scream"" flick.  It always remains a give-and-take free for all, which is quite refreshing.  I can't recommend this movie enough.  It may not be the greatest movie of all time.  It's definitely not the most deeply plotted movie of all time (ELF should be easily understood by all but the most hopeless of brain damage victims)  but it IS the most fun and memorable movie I've seen in a long time.  Also, IT IS NOT A RIPOFF OF TREMORS!!!  I have seen all three Tremors many times, and ELF is nothing like them.  Just because the tongue-in-cheek attitude is similar, that doesn't make it a ripoff.  Watch this movie expecting to have a good time.  But mostly, just watch this movie!  If you haven't seen it, do so now!  In conclusion, I have to say, this movie is pretty well summed up by it's own slogan...Let the SQUASHING begin!",Eight Legged Freaks

Giant spiders invade, humans evade- this is the premise and the execution is deft, if not engaging. This is a classic example of a good B movie, made on a decent B movie budget where the monsters are perfect and the acting not too much further from self deprecation. David Arquette is perfect as the lead and the film also features a young scarlet johannsen. All in all this is a fantastic B movie.",Eight Legged Freaks

Get ready for the fun!
Eight Legged Freaks (a.k.a. Arac Attack) delivers what most modern day horror movies don't: the ultimate fun experience of shivering horror. The choice to make David Arquette the leading actor for this movie couldn't have been better. Arquette has made Wes Craven's Scream a special event. Looking like the little lost boy of a backwater town he adds to the funny moments of the movie.Kari Wuhrer, Scott Terra, Scarlett Johansson as the Parker family have so many gags, references to other movies and fun moments that you might think they jumped right out of an mid-1980ies Steven Spielberg movie.The very unrealistic yet extreme funny story of how the spiders morph to big man-eating monsters reminds of the fantastic 1950ies trash B-movies of science fiction and horror.The movie has its moments with horror but most of the time it's just plain good old fun to watch the story unfold. Boombastic sound underlines the action sequences with motorcycle chases etc. It's pure adrenalin-fun to watch the actors work their way around the monster-sized spiders. If you watch thoroughfully you'll also catch many humourous references to other horror movies.Best of all you'll probably laugh throughout the whole movie. Fun, excitement and speed never stop in Eight Legged Freaks. NOW GO AND WATCH THAT MOVIE! IT'S GREAT FUN.PS. 8 Arachnoid Thumbs Up!!",Eight Legged Freaks

ELF is some of the best ""popcorn movies"" i have seen for years. Good looking monsters (especially the real big ones rule), all stereotypes needed (toxic waste, non-believed children, crying women, cash-hungry old men, young saviors) and a lot of action. And the best thing about this movie is, that it's partly self-spoofing. For example the little boy that exactly knows (and says) that noone will believe a little child. Or like a big spider trying to attack a deer head on the wall. As the producers said they're big fans of 50s B-Movies and you can see that in every single scene. As some might say (or have said) the acting is not that good, but i think that fits perfectly the whole concept of the movie. It even has some of the good illogical parts like the motorbike in the mine ;) You know what i mean... So, all in all i would've give it 10 stars if there were more splatter in it (scenes like the chainsaw ""cutting""). But that's my personal taste, splatter isn't the prevalent part of B-Movies, so i guess it's ok.All in all: Watch it and have fun. Nothing more but for sure nothing less",Eight Legged Freaks

It wasn't ever supposed to take itself seriously as a traditional horror movie.

You can pretty much guess what happens next...This film is a tribute to every great sci-fi/horror movie since the 1950's. It has great special effects and drops you right into the action. It's entertaining from start to finish. What I love most is the total (and I think purposeful) disregard for trying to create that cliche horror 'suspense'. Anyone who walks backwards into a room, or pops their heads through a hole in the wall is immediately eaten by a giant spider! Am I the only person who sees this as deliberate disrespect by the director to all those cheesy horror flicks from the 80's :)Watch this movie with some squeemish girls for extra laughs :) My wife is terrified of spiders but she loved it despite screaming several times.

Even seeing them on screen freaks me out, but I only had to cover my eyes once.  Throughout the entire movie the spiders giggle and laugh.  The characters are fun, and funny.  The entire theatre was laughing along with me.
If you're looking for some sophisticated film this isn't it, but if you are looking for fun, here ya go.  Seriously!  I was waiting for this movie to come out because it was supposed to just be nothing more then an homage to the bug movies of the 50's, and it fulfilled it's goal.  I was so entertained.Not only that, but the CGI in the film was believable.  It didn't just look like computer animation.

I actually wish they would make funny films like this. I suppose they do on Syfy and channels like that, though this had much better quality in comparison to something from T.V. I can remember certain scenes pretty well, one of the best was when the female spider stabbed someone with a poker and began feasting on their blood while the webbed up person was still squirming. It was so appallingly creepy and yet extremely effective in the quality of the effects. It did well in generating emotional response. I loved how they ended up in a mall and started killing all the spiders too. I definitely need to check this film out again soon. Overall if your looking for Citizen Kane, this isn't it, but if your looking for a lot of fun with creepy special effects and fun characters who act over the top against giant arachnids. This is definitely a must watch. I would also say this film has that early 2000's quality as it was made in 2002. I don't know but films are fun to watch to get an idea of the time they were done in, which to me at least, is enjoyable as you think about what that time was like.8 out of 10 and only because the two missing stars add to the quality of this being a fun film that should wear any imperfections with pride.One more thing, forgot that ScarJo was in this, this should absolutely be considered one of her best films ever!!! ;)",Eight Legged Freaks

When Sheriff Sam asked him to help load her son's bike onto the truck: ""Yeah, okay, sure."" Poor thing was crying and sniffling like a baby when his wife left him over the cat's electrocution. You could also tell he was totally henpecked by his wife. He didn't even have enough sense to wipe the spider sh*t off his face after shooting it. Something nasty and slimy is dripping down on your head and you don't even care? Greasy, ponytail-wearing Mayor Wade: ""That was an excellent ostrich burger."" Gotta give it to him: he actually had ostrich burgers as a fast food meal at his mall since he was raising the nasty little buggers on his farm and wanted to turn a profit with them somehow. (Give me one jumbo ostrich burger, fries and a Coke! Ewwwww). He locked the basement door at Prosperity Mall so the rest of the townspeople could deal with the spiders and only thought about saving himself. He deserved to be eaten by the spiders and I was sort of sorry they rescued him. How he ever got elected mayor is anybody's guess. Maybe nobody else wanted the job.Sheriff Sam wasn't very convincing: Her daughter looked about 5 or 6 six years younger than her mom! It made her mom seem like sort of a slut and an underachieving one at that --- Pregnant at 16, divorced with 2 kids and staying on as Sheriff in a small, economically, disadvantaged mining town of no importance to anyone but its out of work residents. Did she even finish high school? I guess you didn't need any qualifications to be Sheriff in Prosperity so why not give the pretty, divorcée a chance to wear a uniform and carry a gun? The daughter was just a mean spirited teenage brat and her part was sort of a throwaway.I didn't really care if Chris McCormick survived. He was ""sooooo boring"" and not attractive in any way. Why on earth would Sam want him? Aunt Gladys was sort of a hoot, but why was she so alcoholic and ravaged looking? She looked like the product of some hard drinking, inner-city New Jersey, crime-infested ghetto instead of an Arizona desert town.They didn't really flesh out the characters very well because the focus was on the mutant spiders.The movie suffered from split personality: I'm a comedy, no I'm a horror story, no wait, I'm an action movie, I'm romantic.....whatever.It would have been so much better if they were either a comedy or a horror story and had a plot that was true to one or the other.I actually did enjoy this movie because I overlooked the stupidity and bad acting and just had fun with it.",Eight Legged Freaks

I could not believe how boring this film was.  Maybe I can put the blame on the PG-13 violence (I have seen more blood shed on the Disney Channel).  I can only imagine what a producer like Roger Corman could have done with this material (think The Nest, a fun film on many levels), with high campiness, lots of cartoon gore, and a couple of gratuitous shots of naked female flesh.

The characters in the ""classic"" B monster movies from the 1950s and 60s had this sort of breathless amazement at the giant praying mantis/creature from the black lagoon/space creatures that are attacking the town/state/planet. ""Eight Legged Freaks"" seems to be winking at the audience the entire time in a ""this is goofy and we know it"" sort of way. Most of the time it succeeds in striking the right tone. If you're like me and go into this movie expecting nothing, you will be pleasantly surprised. Let me be perfectly clear though, this is not a good movie, although it is better and funnier than ""Mr. Deeds"". Also, I dare say that this is the finest film ever made about spiders attacking humans, surpassing such classics as ""Arachnophobia"" and ""The Giant Spider Invasion"".

My biggest complaint that some of the film seemed like it was filler, quite generic, and bland until the spiders reappear. the town scenes seemed like a rehash of gremlins and other critter movies. dont go to the film expecting a horror or gore fest, or even a complete comedy. the movie is a good balance that never takes itself too seriously. id say wait till budget if you are unsure, but do yourself a favour enjoy this guilty pleasure.",Eight Legged Freaks

Basically, It was one of the biggest messes of a film that I have ever seen.The story (if that) was okay, a small town being taken over by giant spiders, it had the potential to be a fun movie.

The scripting does a pretty good job of providing the tension - release necessary to make you jump out of your seat occasionally. Arquette basically plays the same character he portrayed in the 'Scream' series. That's ok, it's what's called for in this movie as well . . . a bumbling, head-strong, likeable hero.  And, really that's where the biggest disappointment (other than the dumb name) lies.  With one exception, everyone plays his or her role adequately but there's nothing special. Geeky kid who no one listens to until its almost too late (ok); bad guy mayor (ok); tough single-mom-sheriff-love-interest (slightly better than ok); belligerent teen daughter who is actually a good kid just trying to spread her wings (actually pretty good); and intellectually challenged deputy who manages to come through in the end (borderline).  The one truly bright casting move is the paranoid talk show host given just the right touch of crazed prophet by Doug E. Doug.  Doug (works for either first or last name) is probably best remembered for his inspired character acting in early '90s comedies like Class Act also fairly recently spent a stint as one of Hollywood's Squares.Some of the special effects are really outstanding, but they seem to be somewhat wasted on this cast.  So, if you like the genre, it's probably worth at least one viewing, but this is not the movie to introduce into the ranks of fans of 'nature gone wild' science fiction.",Eight Legged Freaks
174,Eugangus,A valiant effort,5,2 August 2002,"I imagine that `Eight Legged Freaks' had a troubled pre-production period. It is not easy to get a giant animal movie made in Hollywood. However, it is perfectly feasible to film one in Roger Corman's backyard.  In fact, I believe that at least one video about giant animals and topless bimbos gets filmed on Corman's property once every three hours.  But I digress. Hollywood just has a phobia of producing of films about tank-sized spiders, crocodiles, basset hounds or whatever mammal or gastropod is all the rage with the kids these days. No plot summary is needed in this review. You can pretty much surmise from the title of the flick that it's not a musical rendition of  `Death of a Salesman'. Nope, it's about spiders.  Toxic waste, rap music or violent video games  I don't remember which  mutates a whole slew of small unpleasant arachnids into a whole slew of giant unpleasant arachnids.  Some unknown influence then drives several different species of spiders to join together in loving union and work towards the extermination of every household pet and human on the planet. I am by no means an expert on this genus, but I have watched enough Discovery Channel programs to know that arachnids are not the most amicable creatures. It's my belief that if a bird-eating tarantula were to encounter another class of arthropods, half its size that it would probably eat them; not attempt to form a perfect Utopia with them. Ex-miner, Chris McCormack (David Arquette) and Sheriff, Sam Parker (Kari Wuhrer) gather the townsfolk together to battle the invading hordes of creepy crawlers. Arquette and Wuhrer each deliver some good performances. The supporting cast deserves kudos as well for creating one of the weirdest bunch of rednecks ever to shuffle across the silver screen. Unfortunately, good casting was not enough to save this cute little film from poor writing and not-so-special special effects. Good try though.After viewing this production, I could not help but feel a little sad. For you see, it will probably be a really long time before Hollywood musters up the courage to make another giant animal movie. Until then, we'll all be stuck watching giant lustful lemurs ripping the tops off B-movie queens Lorissa McComas and Michelle Bauer in Roger Corman's latest backyard production. Sigh.",Eight Legged Freaks
175,Dr Pepper,"Fun, but too fun",4,16 September 2002,"Eight Legged Freaks is a modern monster movie, like a remake of any of the old 'Attack of the giant [INSERT ANIMAL HERE]'-movies of the 50s, 60s and 70s. Or rather, it should have been more like a remake of the, instead of what is was. So, how is a monster movie done in the year 2002? Well, from the typical opening with some chemical making the spiders grow to huge proportions, they mix movies like Gremlins, Jurassic Park, Starship Troopers and flavor it with some parody like Scary Movie. Gremlins is probably the best comparison, but Eight Legged Freaks was so full of parodies and stupid jokes that it was sometimes more like Scary Movie. It was way too much, at least if you're looking for a monster movie and not just another parody movie filled with jokes.For a movie like this you don't expect much of the acting, and that is just the way it was. The story though was extremely thin, with just a bunch of loosely connected events to show off some action mixed with all of the jokes, leading up to an easily spotted and corny ending.I rate Eight Legged Freaks a 4/10, and that includes the fact that the special effects where pretty good and that the noises the spiders made where hilarious.",Eight Legged Freaks

Oh Lord, was I ever laughing... NOT! This is why I like similar themed 50s films more: they don't try to be something they're not. You watch THEM, and THEM is what you get. Is THEM a children's film? I don't know, but I did see it first when I was a child. Oh, no wait. That's right. People are so much more SOPHISTICATED today. They can never accept giant spiders on the loose, so it's got to be made into a comedy for them to ""enjoy"". Obviously there is a contigent of people out there who think genre stuff is ridiculous.

I usually can't stand David Arquette, but in this movie he is actually tolerable. He cuts down on the cheese factor and plays it fairly straight, and that was a great relief to me. This has a great campy feel to it. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and allows us to be in on the fun.

Afraid not. Is it Academy Award material? I don't think so. Is it *fun*? You bet! Part of the fun of this movie is that it *isn't* trying to educate anybody about the environment, the ozone layer, global warming, or terrorist attacks.

Thankfully, this movie proved to be everything I had hoped for, and then some.Eight Legged Freaks is a throwback to the classic B&W sci-films of my youth, the kind that you used to be able to see late at night or on a lazy Saturday afternoon.  There is no complicated justification for the giant spiders, they're just there.  There's no dramatic over-acting, or glaring displays of special effects, not even any gratuitous sex or nudity.  All this movie has is fun, and it's got plenty of that.Beyond the joy of watching these spiders run amok and completely destroy the city, Eight Legged Freaks has numerous homages to classic movies.

The plot is SO bad, it's unbelievable, and i think you can easily guess it by the title. Here's the story: A horde of spiders mutate overnight, and start killing people in the local town. It's not a horror movie. There's not a single scene that's chocking, and where's the atmosphere? Even if the characters have seen their best friends been eaten by giant mutant spiders, they don't seem to be very affected. They are still sarcastic and make stupid b-film jokes, where they are supposed to be frightened and sad. Okay, we laughed a couple of times while we saw this (when the spiders got shot, and the ugly-made blood splattered all over the place), and the silly sounds they had given all the monsters. When did spiders start making *squaky* alien sounds?And a little one for the goofs: At the ending, they are walking around in a mine, filled with methane gas. They can't make any kind of fire or sparkle, because it will set it off. Still, they can run a motor cycle with an explosion-engine. LOL.1/10 stars. crap.",Eight Legged Freaks

192,moffitt2,Delivered what it promised.,7,5 November 2002,This is the best movie about giant spiders eating a town that I've seen in a long time. If you are in the mood to watch people and animals being eaten by mutant arachnids then you must see this movie.Not only does this movie rank fairly high on the list of giant spider films it also stands up quite well when compared to the entire 'mutant creatures/monster/walking dead/space alien/biker gang/etc. attack isolated town' genre of film.Admittedly 'Eight Legged Freaks' doesn't have as good of a story or acting as 'Shawshank Redemption' but then 'Shawshank Redemption' doesn't have people being eaten by giant mutant spiders. It all comes down to what you want to watch in a movie. If you go in expecting to see a B movie about giant spiders them you will be happy with 'Eight Legged Freaks' because it delivers just that.

Child actors in most movies are just not very good and come across either self-conscious or remote. Doug E. Doug was also very funny as a radio personality who thinks aliens are coming.The only slow part of the movie for me was during some of the mine scenes toward the end where the action got a bit repetitive.Given the limitations imposed by using a typical B movie story line, I don't know if this film could have been any better.

I think people say to themselves, ""Are they still making movies like that?"" Answer: Yes. This is a great B-movie, with great effects and a few genuinely fun-to-watch scenes. The plot is minimal, truck accidentally spills toxic waste into a pond, crickets get infected and are fed to the spiders who grow to super-size and start eating people. The best scene is when the jumping spiders chase the dirt-bikers around desert hills. There is no human blood, lots of spider blood, no dialogue, a couple of good gags, and lots of spiders.

197,srfryer,a review,10,30 July 2002,"Two months ago, while I was wasting away the afternoon in front of the television, I saw a preview for ELF on some random channel. I think I was hooked on this movie from that moment on. The stuff I saw on that trailer was exactly what people like me hope for in a movie. First, I saw the GIANT MUTANT SPIDERS. That's something that everyone enjoys in a movie. Then there was the title, Eight Legged Freaks. It's not serious and its not dumb. It's the best title for this kind of movie. They could have called it GIANT MUTANT SPIDERS, but that gives too much away. And I also saw David Arquette in the trailer screaming ""Get away you eight legged freaks!"" and that was awesome. Arquette's been in most of the SCREAM movies, and he's always been a good actor in the horror category. I expected he'd be just as great in ELF.So from that short trailer I was sure that this movie was going to be awesome. I'm sure many people didn't share my immediate enthusiasm toward ELF, since there weren't a lot of clips and it was probably not as good as other summer blockbusters. Anyway, summer went on and I saw a few other random movies. They'll be reviewed somewhere else. Finally more commercials began to show up between my favorite shows and they only further melted the film into my brain. Soon the only movie I could think about was ELF and not even the trailers for SIGNS could distract me. I knew that if I didn't see this movie I would go insane.Turns out the weekend ELF was released was the weekend that I was allowed to invite a friend to come over. I met Paul over at Golfland and then he, his friend Ted (?) and I went to Century Theaters. This theater was empty of life except for a few young kids in the arcade and some employees at the concession stand. I'd be avoiding the stand because a small candy can cost up to $2.75 and that is about $2.50 too much. A small soda is the same price as renting a movie. If I wanted to buy expensive food I'd go to a fancy restaurant. So I spend my remaining four dollars in the arcade with San Francisco Rush. We had to wait for about forty minutes for the movie because we got there so early. I just wanted to get inside and watch the movie already. Soon enough it was time to go into the theater.The previews were pretty good. DREAMCATCHER looks like it'll be good, mostly because it's from a Stephen King book. Anyway, the movie starts and the credits begin to roll. All the while I am expecting nothing out of this movie beside a good time. All horror movies start out the same way. All the classics, at least. In TREMORS, no one knows about the giant worms, the roads are conveniently closed because of construction, and the phone lines are down. In ELF, no one knows about the spiders (except the smart kid, but that's okay because no one listens to the kid anyway), the roads are blocked and the phones are down. But, unlike TREMORS, these three things happen over time- and not right away. The phone lines, for example, go down after the spider's chase down the motorcycles. That's not for about twenty, maybe thirty minutes into the movie.And then there's always that one completely random place or thing that causes all the trouble. And it wasn't the truck driving through town with the toxic waste that was random, because the barrels of waste were going to the mines (that was briefly explained later in the movie). It was the Exotic Spider Farm that caused all this trouble, and why the hell is there a spider farm in the middle of nowhere, anyway? So a barrel of toxic waste falls out of the truck and lands in a pond. The crickets around the pond are used as food for the spiders in the farm, so soon these toxic waste carrying crickets are being fed to the spiders and this is where trouble begins.But before you get to see the GIANT MUTANT SPIDERS, you have to meet the characters that will later save the day. There's David Arquette's character Chris, who left town ten years ago and is just now returning. His dad owned the mines around town. It's not totally clear why Chris leaves town. But his dad went crazy and died while Chris was gone and it was because of the methane gas that the mines were full of. Inhaling too much of that stuff will make anything look like a gorgeous woman, even a bottomless pit of death.Then there's the hottest police officer ever filmed. Kari Wuhrer plays Sheriff Sam Parker, a single mother of two. She runs the town with help of her partner, Deputy Pete (played by Rick Overton, who was hilarious). Her children, Mike and Ashley, are also important characters. Mike is a regular visitor at the spider farm and knows a lot about the creatures. He even has a program on his computer to show how large a spider can grow based on spider body parts. Ashley is a rebel in the making with a motorcycle-riding boyfriend. Scarlett Johansson plays Ashley, and she is pretty damn hot.And there's Doug E. Doug's character Harlan. He's a paranoid guy who talks about conspiracies and such things over his radio station. Everyone in town listens to it. He has some good lines here and there, but it wasn't really about the comedy in the movie anyway. There's a bunch of other people to meet as well. Wade, the mayor, is a money-spending jerk that no one really likes. He owns a couple ostriches. There's Chris' aunt Gladys who gives Chris a place to stay.So by the time you've met everyone, the GIANT MUTANT SPIDERS have already grown gigantic. They slowly make their way into town through the mines. First they eat pets and small animals like that, but soon they begin feasting on people. No one knows what to make of it. The movie goes at a steady pace and gradually speeds up as more spiders show up. It's just like every horror movie before it, which makes it perfect. And after about an hour, all hell breaks loose when all of the GIANT MUTANT SPIDERS are crawling through town jumping on people or snatching them into their holes. The smart kid has told us that these spiders in town are all males, and that they're just taking the people back to the female- who must eat.The female is 3 times the size of the males, so now that they've become GIANT MUTANT SPIDERS, you can expect a really freakin' huge beast. Now they must destroy the female to save the town, but also find a way to dispose of the males at the same time. How will they do this? Well, I'll tell you that it has something to do with the mines.Overall it was a really awesome movie. People expected a comedy and they were disappointed. But the actors and film crew tried to tell people that the movie was not a comedy. It was a horror movie. I knew that, and so I was pleased. The pace was perfect and the death toll was high and great. The special effects were very well done through most of the movie except for a few short spider attack scenes. The guys from INDEPENDENCE DAY worked on this movie, and they're the ones who brought us the awesome scenes where the wall of fire moves through New York. Good stuff.I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes old-fashioned horror movies or that just likes GIANT MUTANT SPIDERS in general. I liked this movie a lot. I give it a solid 9 out of 10. I lowered the score one point because of the few scenes where the spiders looked way too fake. I mean, how hard is it to make better lighting or use more shadows to make the scene look realistic? I'm talking about the scenes when someone's on the ground kicking and screaming because there's a spider on them, but I really couldn't believe those scenes because the spider looked like it wasn't really on top of the person. It's hard to explain, but easy to notice.

(then gets eaten) or -man looking at dead people trapped in all kinds of webs in a mineshaft ""Just what in the heck has been going on here!?"" (dude has already seen the giant spiders too ;) It's fun though. The spiders are clever. They use a tarantula as a battering ram to get into places where the smaller spiders don't have the muscle to bust in. Mind you, this is smarter than anything the humans do during the entire movie (except when the ten year old saves them at the end).
So, if you are looking for a fun Creature Feature romp then this can be a good flick. Just don't expect too much out of the two legged freaks and you won't get frustrated. The spider special effects are detailed and realistic and that really gives it a nice newer creature flick appeal. They also hit up the classic ""trapped in a mall"" trope that I never seem to get tired of, only this time with spiders instead of zombies. All in all, it scratches the itch for a creature horror movie.",Eight Legged Freaks
203,eor14,Campy Fun!,8,24 February 2003,I watched this movie on DVD based soley on the reviews that said it was funny and a return to the B-movie genre.  It was that and more.  I don't usually enjoy David Arquette but he was loveable in this movie.  This movie made me both laugh and jump.  It knew how to poke fun at itself without seeming pathetic.  If you're looking for a campy movie with things jumping out at you this is a good pick.,Eight Legged Freaks
204,fgibbs,"big ass spiders, big ass action, little ass story",6,18 July 2002,"it had good special effects, good action, but the acting was a little shaky and the story-line with all the subplots seemed unnecessary. nobody's cares about kari wuhrer's and david arquette's history. get to the spiders dammit!",Eight Legged Freaks
205,James_IV,It's a good B-Movie,8,7 November 2021,"I still remember when this film came out when I was a kid, and it seemed to be a theme of movies at the time. Well I never got the chance back then, but thanks to Netflix I finally was able to see this ""gem"".First of all, as my title says, it's a B-Movie. So it's not going to win any awards, it's not going to be deep or philosophical, you're going to get what you expect. Stupid silly humor, with way out in left field ideas that make not a lick of sense, that you can sit back, enjoy, and not have to take serious.The film of course follows the usual molds out there. Chemicals are leaked, because of a tired truck driver, that are due to the mayor's shady business. Then you mix that in with a guy who is trying to make money off spiders, even illegally importing them. Mix it all together, and you got a receipt for massive spiders that are hungry, with humans being the best food source (outside cats, dogs, and ... ostriches)Anyone is a target, many people will die, in all sorts of ways.The film is predictable, shoot I already figured out how it would end probably 15 mins in, but that didn't stop me from watching it and laughing.Which speaking of laughing, the part that probably got me the most was the comicalness of the spiders themselves. Mainly the sounds that were used for them. The best way I could put it, it reminded me of good old classic cartoons. They were totally out of character, but made the spiders almost feel ... playful. There was also a scene when the big bad tarantula, squashes a fellow spider, because it didn't get out of the way and was stepped on ... comically.One thing I was really impressed with, was the CG. The film came out in 2002, and of course, was a B-Movie. Yet the CG of the spiders was actually pretty good. Their movements felt very natural from all 8 legs running around, to how they'd hang off stuff, or jump. Every movement they did was rather impressive. Even how they interacted around the environment (like crashing into a wall or something). For the type of film, and the year, they get huge props.If you find yourself with a few hours to spare, and just want to take it easy, I'd strongly suggest you give this film a watch, especially if you are a fan of the Tremors films, since those were the vibes I got watching this. Just be warned, if you are a cat person, the beginning may not make you the most pleased with the film.",Eight Legged Freaks
206,VirtualBob,Rockem'-Sockem' Fun... If you're not expecting much.,7,18 July 2002,"Don't go to this moving expecting a flowing, grandiose plot with detailed character development and what have you.  Go to this movie expecting... something more along the lines of an amusement park ride.You don't go to an amusement park expecting deep, philosophical meaning or great feats of magical artwork.  You to go an amusement park to simply have some simple fun.  You should expect the same from this movie.The advertising has done an excellent job of suggesting this.  Every advertisement I've seen (from the two or so different TV ads to the theater trailers and, especially, the web site) has been very straightforward about the movie's high gross-out factor (lots of ooey-gooey, slimy chunks flying everywhere and tons of squishing and squashing sounds).  The ads have also let you know that the movie makes no attempt to be anything other than just what it is - just a bunch of silly, simple, slimy, cool, hokey FUN.Go; have fun; enjoy the popcorn!",Eight Legged Freaks
207,mward45,8 stars from me,8,10 August 2002,"I enjoyed this film mainly because of the way the spiders were handled. They were all given their respective scientific names and habits. The effects were very good, and the storyline was basically one from those monster movies in the 50's and 60's - small town invaded by giant creatures and the townsfolk fight them off. There were enough laughs to stop it becoming an all out boring B-movie whilst there were enough jumps to keep you jumpy. The characters were ok, nothing special. I think that there is enough here to keep most people amused, even if they are afraid of spiders. No doubt there are those out there that don't like this film, but that is their opinion. I liked the film, I'm saying that everyone else should. Everyone is entitled to their opinion.",Eight Legged Freaks

From start to finish COMEDY! Anyone who expects to see a ""serious"" film about gigantic spiders(more than one breed) plauging a small isolated town is out of luck.

The spiders steal the show.  Though the plot does drag a bit in a few places the film generally moves quickly and has you jumping in your seats as spiders big and small pop out of everywhere.  The film appears to be done in the same style as ""Tremors"" and definitely captures the light heartedness of that film.  Good Entertainment.  Enjoy the popcorn.",Eight Legged Freaks
218,Faldace,Campy spoof on horror films of the past,9,20 July 2002,This movie was hilarious. I went expecting something cheesy but it far surpassed my expectations. The performance of the spiders reminded me of Gremlins and the human stars played it so straight that Leslie Nielsen would be proud. Some of the information about the spiders was redundant and inaccurate but everyone I saw it with laughed until our sides hurt. There is some violence to small animals and some gross scenes but they fit the movie well. I would recommend this to anyone who just wants to laugh at big ugly things.,Eight Legged Freaks

It Confuses The Audience To Much,5,21 July 2002,"Based On My Viewing Of The Movie (Eight Legged Freaks) I Have Come To a Conclusion that the movie deserves a lower grade than a 6. When I Viewed It, I heard other audience members laugh or scream when A Spider attacked someone. I Have to Admit I laughed myself at a lot of the scenes. My Girlfriend was a little of both. In My Point, If The Directors of the past wanted to scare us, they would scare us. These Directors knew how to scare the audience and have them not give a giggle. In 8 Legged freaks, The directer does both during a special effects movie when we are supposed to be scared and wetting our pants. Independence Day was more scarier then this movie and we laughed a few times, not at almost every scene.",Eight Legged Freaks
220,americarulesus,"Enjoyable to start, but ends up slightly stale.",7,18 July 2002,"I just got back from seeing this film and my opinions are that it was a pretty fun movie, but got a little too boring at times.  I knew that it would be just like old B-movies and didn't take itself seriously, but I expected it to be a little more funny than it actually was.The premise is your average fare (and one of the highlights in my opinion). Spiders are exposed to radioactivity and become as large as humans.  These ""Eight Legged Freaks"" naturally eat every living being they can find, until the town bands together to save themselves.  Quite cheesy, but it seems like it's supposed to be.The plot moves along nicely, and I found myself laughing at the little jokes and other things that happened along the way.  I had expected it to be a lot like it was, but I was disappointed to see a lack of humor at the end. The movie starts out extremely funny (how the spiders are exposed, different characters personalities, etc.)...but ends up like the end of any monster movie.  It wasn't as fresh as I thought it would be near the end.If you are a fan of classic B-movies, specifically those about bugs and spiders, you owe yourself to see this one.  If from first glance it doesn't seem funny, DON'T watch it.  I thought it would be funny, and indeed it was pretty funny and enjoyable...it just became a little stale at the end.",Eight Legged Freaks
221,cdask1,Let the squashing begin!,10,17 July 2002,Maybe the best action freak movie of the last decade! The dialogs are very clever and there is a lot of suspense all the time.

Granted there are a few places the movie kind of dips towards almost dragging, but overall the movie is pretty darn good. Spooky? Well, with the way things jump out and fly by the screen you do jump from time to time.  There were times when I knew exactly what was going to happen, but the volume level still made me jump.Good summary of the flick:  ""Aracnaphobia on Steroids""",Eight Legged Freaks

If you on the other hand are looking for a fun, easy going, self-ironic, goo-filled and delightfully exaggerated monster-flick that'll make you crack open from laughing, you sure have come to the right place. Don't be to overly concerned by the acting or the few holes in the plot - Keep in mind that ""Eight Legged Freaks"" is a monster-flick, and more than true to this genre.

What can possibly be better than giant spiders replacing humans as top of the food chain!?  It is in my mind an instant big bug classic! MOVE OVER KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS!! MOVE OVER THEM!! 8 legged freaks is WONDERFUL! I was not only on the edge of my seat saying, ""no! not the doggie!"", but I was laughing til my sides ached! Yes, my taste in movies is somewhat caseating at times but, even if you don't like cheesy horror, this is a must see!  If only once, you have got to at least rent it! I personally love David Arquette movies.  He makes me laugh and he pulls off his rolls so well. There isn't a movie he has been in that I haven't seen and that I didn't think he did a great job in. And! I am ever so pleased that Kari Wuhrer got such a good part.  I have watched her since ""remote control"" and this movie was so much better than swamp thing the series(which I watched quite often....maybe that will show you where my visual entertainment ball rolls). They did great casting Kari for that part and I hope she gets other rolls that show can act as well. My rant has been vented....I made my husband buy me this movie the second it came out so we could watch it. I can only hope all of you at least watch this movie once.....even is it's just for giant spider death...:)...and look out for then hand on David Arquette's leg when the dog chews on his pants.",Eight Legged Freaks

I have to say I don't really know anything about the actors, director but a first class job! I found it very, very funny and liked the way the spiders (the CGI was pretty good for what I presume was not made as a blockbuster) adopted some ""human"" characteristics. Loved the way that great big one reacted to perfume in the face! And also the on-going joke throughout the movie of the hero trying to approach the sexy sheriff only to be interrupted each time - with the final part of ""Oh, your Dad told me that"" and ""that was easy!""

Although i will admit not the best film i have ever seen in terms of acting it still ranks up there with some of the best i have seen.

It is very firmly a throwback to the giant monster movies of the 1950's. The premise is a familar one; 'something', be it radiation or chemical causes a lifeform, usually in a small out of the way location, to hideously mutate and grow.

It's not trying to be Hamlet or Die Hard, it's stupid and it admits it's stupid. The premise is silly (spiders will never be the size of houses e.g.) but it's an enjoyable romp. Plenty of hidden jokes - Grant Wood - American Gothic et al; and yes a predictable outcome. It's not a ""Fuck You"" movie as Reginald D. Hunter would describe. It's humorous.

230,sprx117,Flash backs from the 50's,9,2 March 2005,*****Spoilers****** OK the movie starts out with a person moving back to a backwater town that once had a mine as the primary income but the mine dried up and there's nothing there now so the town's mayor does whatever he can to raise money from making an ostrich ranch to sell them as burgers to making a mall. Basically the person moving back had been in love with the chief of police and her son on a regular basis visits a crazy old man that lives in the middle of nowhere and collects spiders which recently have tripled in size by drinking the water. In a deleted scene I thought they should leave in the mayor was making money by burying toxic waste in the town but they did leave in a scene where they fish out a barrle of it. But the movie just goes on with the Town rallying together when the spiders get to big and start attacking which leads the survivors to gather in a mall and get whatever they can to fight the spiders the movie brings back memories of the movie Dawn of the Dead and I think it was a great movie which I thought would be scary because of the fact that I have Arachniphbia but the movie was funny as hell. The acting was stupid but in a good way the movie just wouldn't seem good and funny if the lines weren't cheesy and redone like a thousand times in other movies.,Eight Legged Freaks
