0,TheLittleSongbird,Fantastic,10,26 April 2011,"I wasn't sure about Serenity at first. I knew it was based off the brilliant TV show Firefly, and while I was interested part of me had my reservations too. Apart from a couple of exceptions I have seen a fair number of based-of-TV-show films and they haven't worked at all, the worst offenders being Dragonball Evolution, My Favourite Martian and Wild Wild West, and I remember disliking The Avengers and The Dukes of Hazzard too.Serenity to my surprise worked wonderfully. On its own it is a fantastic film and is not a disgrace to the show. Firefly as many before me have said was amazing, and one of the worst decisions FOX ever made was cancelling it before it had the chance to blossom even more. Serenity does have a somewhat simplistic story, but it is also a well-written, intense and thrilling one that maintains the tone of the show nicely. The dialogue is often intelligent and thought-provoking too, and Joss Whedon does a great job directing the film.The action thrills and excites, the music is clever and doesn't detract from the atmosphere and the visuals and effects are dazzling. The actors do do a credible job in connecting to their characters, who may be over-familiar perhaps in set-up but quite likable and compelling thanks to the acting and writing. Nathan Fillion especially is great.All in all, a fantastic film both as a stand-alone and a successor to a superior but equally fantastic show. For me, Serenity is easily one of the better based-of-TV-show films I have seen. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Serenity
1,Leofwine_draca,Good stand alone space adventure,6,13 December 2016,"SERENITY is a spin-off movie from the sci-fi TV series FIREFLY. I'd never watched the latter but decided to watch this because – well, I was just in the movie for some decent science fiction. I got it. The good news is that you don't need to be knowledgeable regarding the series, because this film is designed to appeal both to serious fans and newcomers alike. I was slightly worried about this being the brainchild of Joss Whedon, having never been a big fan of BUFFY, but I needn't have worried as it's clear Whedon's developed plenty of experience and skill when it comes to directing, and this is never less than a polished and efficient movie.The story is fairly predictable, but the scenarios are kept fresh and consistently engaging. A bunch of misfits pilot a little ship around the universe and have to contend with a sinister evil corporation and a bunch of cannibal types. Much of the film is a chase scenario, with a heavy focus on the action. I like action films whether either a) the action is so great that you don't need story, acting, or a decent script – see Tony Jaa movies in general, or b) the characters are engaging enough for us to go along with them for the story. Well, they didn't skimp on the characterisation here, which makes a refreshing change from the usual throw-money-at-the-screen-in-the-hope-something-sticks attitude of many Hollywood producers.Nathan Fillion is great as the tough-talking captain, a thinly veiled Han Solo but deeper than that, too. He's supported by an attractive cast of familiar faces (Adam Baldwin, Alan Tudyk) in strong roles, kooky Summer Glau who steals many of her scenes, and Chiwetel Ejiofor playing another multi-layered, eminently likable bad guy. Although I'm sure this had more budget constraints than plenty of similar fare, the special effects look pretty darned good with only one scene – a chase between two hovering ships – feeling unrealistic. There are the requisite space battles and martial arts interludes that don't disappoint, as well as an exciting siege-focused climax that nods to ALIENS in an effective way, and some other effective set-pieces (the interlude on the planet full of corpses was very unsettling). This is the usual sci-fi adventure film with a sheen of intelligence to lift it above similar lunk-headed fare.",Serenity
2,SnoopyStyle,"Better for Firefly fans, but still good for everybody else",8,1 January 2014,"Mankind had left Earth for a new solar system with dozens of planets and hundreds of moons. The inner most planets had formed the Alliance, and conquered the outer Independent planets in a destructive war. Mal (Nathan Fillion) and his ragtag band of former rebels are living on the edge of survival. Simon had bought his way on board and rescued sister River from a government facility. She's a secret experiment with psychic powers and hidden memories of a deadly government secret.This is the follow up to the short-lived cult TV show Firefly. Although it's not absolutely necessary to know the TV show to understand the movie, it would help to get the feel of the group dynamics. The relationships are what gives the movie its emotions. The characters are pretty easily decipherable. Nevertheless, their backstories would help.This has the Joss Whedon touches. It has the fast talking inside jokes of a Scooby gang. That's what makes this fun. The CGI is not the absolute top rate, but he makes up for it with inventive energy. The random craziness of the big space battle is something that Star Wars can only aspire to. In fact, Mal is Han Solo. Imagine if Star Wars centered on Han Solo, and you've got this movie.",Serenity
3,claudio_carvalho,Building a Better Utopist World without Sin,8,3 June 2006,"In the future, mankind consumed planet Earth, called ""Earth-that-was"", and moved to other planets and satellites. A new order is established with the totalitarian government of the Alliance, which fights and wins a war against their opponents, the independents. When Dr. Simon Tam (Sean Maher) rescues his teenager telepathic daughter River Tam (Summer Glau) from the claws of the Alliance, they are sheltered by a group of mercenaries and smugglers in the spacecraft Serenity, leaded by the former hero Captain Malcolm 'Mal' Reynolds (Nathan Fillion). The Alliance sends a killer to bring River Tam back, while Mal and his crew find how powerful she is and the truth about the hidden planet Miranda and the origin of the cannibals Reavers.I am not familiarized with the TV series ""Firefly"", but I found ""Serenity"" a good entertainment. The story follows the pattern and clichés of ""Battlestar Gallactica"" and ""Star Wars"", but from a small mercenary spacecraft and the group of politically incorrect captain and crew and not from the military warship as usual. Most of the characters are non-charismatic and incorrect but the other side is worse; therefore in this Utopia, there is no space for good guys. The Brazilian Morena Baccarin has a very exotic beauty in the role of Inara. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Serenity – A Luta Pelo Amanhã"" (Serenity – The Fight For Tomorrow"")Note: On 04 November 2016, I saw this film again.",Serenity
4,kosmasp,Evolution,9,12 July 2007,"It's not necessary to be aware or have seen the TV Series (Firefly), but it doesn't hurt if you have watched it! The cool thing is, that even though, this does help newbies get into the Firefly World, it's also aware of the many fans, the show had/has, so it's not an obvious ""previously on the ..."" reprise, but you'll get glimpses of characters, background information, all woven into the plot. For some the pacing might be too much to bare, but if you're willing to stick with it (especially if you haven't seen the TV Show), then you'll be rewarded a great sci-fi/western/comedy/adventure! The whole cast from the show reprises their roles and they love it. Nathan Fillion is great as the others actors are, because they ""know their roles"" (pun intended). Witty charming and above all well written!",Serenity
5,classicsoncall,Let's think about this a minute.,7,6 October 2005,"Twenty years from now, people will still be watching sci-fi movie classics like ""Star Wars"", ""Alien"", and ""Terminator"". I have a hard time convincing myself anyone will even remember ""Serenity"". Granted, I have never seen the ""Firefly"" series on which the film was based, but even if I had, I can't imagine this movie even being mentioned in the same breath as those listed above, not to mention true sci-fi classics that have withstood the test of time of half a century like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"".I'll concede that the film is entertaining enough as an action adventure diversion, with moments of humorous dialog and exciting martial arts mayhem. But ultimately, it's all been said and done before in more innovative and better films. For fans invested in the TV Series, I can understand how the death of a major character like Wash might have caused a shock to their movie going system, but once again, the death of a principal is no longer untimely or surprising.In all honesty, I couldn't go on record stating one should stay away from this film; again, it's an eye candy two hour diversion. But to leap to it's current standing in the IMDb Data Base is a gross testament to popular mass culture. Let's check back in 2025.",Serenity
6,Tweekums,A Great Little Sci-fi Film,9,19 July 2008,"Initially I was unsure about watching this as I knew it was a spin off from a television series that I hadn't seen, I need not have worried though as the characters are introduced in a way that lets us know who they are and what their role is in the story.The story opens with it being explained to a class why humanity left Earth and settled a new solar system which has many habitable planets and moons and how this system was governed by the Alliance which initially ruled the more advanced core planets but after a war now governed the entire system. We are then shown, some years later, one of the students, called River Tam, undergoing a medical procedure in a laboratory till her brother Simon rescues her. This turns out to be a security recording and we learn that the Alliance wants her back because she is a psychic who may have learnt dangerous government secrets, they have sent a character known only as The Operative to retrieve River by whatever means he deems necessary.Mal, the captain of a small transport ship called Serenity, had been a soldier fighting for the losing independents who now makes a living smuggling and stealing from the Alliance, he is also transporting the Tams not knowing just how far the Alliance will go to get River back. As well as the Alliance the crew have to contend with the Reavers, a ferocious race of people who's origins are unknown and who's existence is questioned by those on the core planets.Before watching this I didn't know any of the actors involved but thought they all did a great job especially Summer Glau as the troubled River Tam and Nathan Fillion as Captain Malcolm Reynolds. The dialogue was snappy and for a film with a 15 rating it was refreshingly free from obscenities. There is plenty of action including an impressive scene where River beats up just about everybody in a bar after seeing a subliminal message hidden in a TV advert.Many TV spin-offs feel like a double episode or worse like a single episode that has been padded to fill the time, this however was a proper film that stood on its own. That said I would recommend seeing the series before the film if possible if only because that way you will get to know the characters better and have grown to care for them.",Serenity
7,ma-cortes,Sequel to TV serial with great lot of action and breathtaking special effects,7,24 November 2006,"We are in a future mankind when Earth is exhausted , then people have fled to other satellites . A confederation called the Alliance rules the universe with a new order based in the totalitarianism and dictatorship . Dr. Simon (Sean Maher) recuperates his psychic teenager sister named River (Summer Glau) from the claws of a nasty killer (Chiwetal Ejiofar) who pursues them throughout the whole movie . They are saved by the Serenity spacecraft commanded by captain Malcolm (Nathan Fillion) and with misfit crew members of smugglers and mercenaries (Alan Tudyk , Adam Baldwin , Gina Torres, Jewl Stait , among others) . River finds a planet called Miranda and the crew must discover mysterious secrets behind this hidden place ; besides , confronting the cannibal Reavers .The film displays great loads of action , abundant FX , suspense , terror and results to be extremely entertaining . It begins with a real sense of wonder with stimulating action set pieces illuminating the full-blown adventures of the Serenity crew and winding up into overlong bombastic special-effects when the Serenity confronts enemy crafts with several scenes that have you on the edge of your seat . It's the following-up from the ¨Firefly¨ series also by Joss Whedom (Buffy Slayer) but more focused , more deeply emotional , spectacular and more exciting than television episodes and , of course , with bigger Budget . Fine and ideal cast , they are the habituals from the series . Most actors performed many of their own stunts , as Summer Glau , a trained dancer, used her dancing skills in River's two fights , for the second fight the cameraman, who was also a dancer, moved through a gap around the combatants to achieve the movie's dynamic camera angles . The movie contains a stunning array of technical visual effects by Illusion Arts and with amazing miniature sequences . Furthermore , well executed set design with phenomenal production values . Sensational music by David Newman and colorful cinematography by Jack N.Green (Clint Eastwood's usual cameraman) . The motion picture will appeal to ¨Firefly saga¨ enthusiasts as well as the neophytes who haven't seen the previous television chapters . It's essential and indispensable seeing for Sci-fi buffs , in fact , the film was number one in the US box office . Rating : Better than average , notable.",Serenity
8,BA_Harrison,Forget the hype; Serenity is tripe!,1,25 December 2006,"Having heard great things about this movie, and seeing its high rating on IMDb (currently at 8.0), I threw caution to the wind and bought it on DVD. Having just finished watching it, I have learnt a valuable lesson: never buy blind! Serenity is one of the biggest piles of excrement I have seen in a long while. While it might be the sort of fare that nerds wet themselves over, any sane person will find this mess almost unwatchable.Writer/director Joss Whedon (creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer) has made a film that could only possibly appeal to socially inept teenagers and 30-somethings who still live with their parents. The plot has a germ of a good ideaan attempt at chemically controlling a planet's population backfires resulting in the creation of a race of violent cannibalsbut with an awful script and poor direction by Whedon, the whole thing ends up as a confusing mess. I can only guess that the film's high rating is down to the fact that it had a ready-made fan-base of sci-fi dorks, since it was based on the cult TV series Firefly. Had this not been the case, I imagine the film would have disappeared without a trace.Whedon has no idea how to generate excitement or build tension and fills his script with characters that only serve to annoy. His 'heroes' are so damn irritating that I actually wanted the bad guy to kill them all! They also speak a derivative of standard English (the sort of language sci-fi geeks love to learn and then speak to each other in, assuming they actually have any friends to talk to); even if you have a grasp on the plot, actually understanding what people are talking about in this film is something of a chore.Don't be misled by the overzealous ravings of rabid Firefly fanatics: Serenity is utter codswallop and should be exposed for the bilge it truly is.",Serenity
9,Quinoa1984,"even better once you watch Firefly, but it's not mandatory for enjoyment",9,17 May 2006,"Serenity, the off-shoot of Joss (Buffy-Vampire) Whedon's show Firefly, is able enough to be a dark, thrilling science fiction thriller with some interesting story bits, grandiose special effects, and a few really amazing fight scenes (when River sets off in this one, whew) even if you're a 'virgin' to the whole world. I thought before that it lacked a portal for a non-affiliated viewer, but this isn't entirely the case. After watching the entire series once seeing the movie in the theater, and then seeing the movie again, Whedon is really working a double-edged sword: for the regular sci-fi fan and new to life out in space with Serenity vs. the Alliance/the Reavers, it's still a solid and well plotted movie on its own terms, and for the fan already comfortable with the characters it's a enormous treat. The latter part, for me, came with a kind of caveat.Because Whedon's working both angles, as a mainstream/commercial movie (albeit with a slightly less budget than most, certainly a helluva lot more than he had on the TV show) he needs to make things a little simpler or more condensed for the unaffiliated, so that, for example, the bond between River and the crew is very shaky for a good portion of the movie as opposed to the series where, by the end, they had all come to become closer than at the start when she and Simon first came aboard. Nevertheless, only this- and a major fumble at the very end with something that the Chiwetel Ejiofor character *doesn't* do, which he said he was going to twice- are the biggest flaws to the piece. Upon a reviewing I'm convinced that there's so much that's rich and smart and dangerous for the common genre picture, and when it works it takes risks and keeps things entertaining and bloody (sometimes all at once)!The basic story is that Capt. Reynolds (great lead actor Nathan Fillion) heads the Serenity, carrying the volatile River (Summer Glau) who was made an unlikely weapon by brain treatments that her doctor brother Simon stopped at the last minute. But Ejiofor's assassin character, a clear-eyed, dogmatic type who feels it's his innermost duty to kill River, won't let her or the Serenity get away. Within this, Whedon crafts a stable of characters that's full of romantic entanglements, bitterness, and a consistent strength that somehow binds them through this very dark chapter in Serenity's saga. We also get to see some kick-ass kung-fu scenes (the bar and with the Reavers), some cool special effects out in space, and, surprisingly, some taut carnage and sudden, small tragedies that come up in the climax, which is like a blend of I Am Legend in combat form (and better).The cast is as terrific as it was on the show, with an always fantastic Ejiofor and David Krumholtz very welcome additions, and it has become, rightfully, a quick cult classic among its ardent supporters (of which, for some chunks, I'm one of them). While it's not one of the very best films of its kind, or even of 2005, it speaks to Whedon's impeccable skills as a compelling storyteller- one who's not too different now than in the Buffy days- who can blend action, drama, comedy, romance, etc in a frothy, alive concoction. At the least it's absorbing, and worth repeat viewings..",Serenity
10,hitchcockthelegend,"This is the captain. We have a little problem with our entry sequence, so we may experience some slight turbulence and then - explode.",7,20 August 2011,"Serenity is written and directed by Josh Whedon. It stars Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin, Jewel Staite, Sean Maher, Summer Glau, Ron Glass and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Music is by David Newman and cinematography by Jack N. Green.When the captain Mal Reynolds (Fillion) of the space craft Serenity takes on board Dr. Simon Tam (Maher) and his troubled sister River (Glau), it thrusts the entire crew into a world of conspiracy and galactic despots.Coming at it as a complete novice as regards ""Firefly"", the short lived TV show that Serenity is spawned from, I personally have no frame of reference to work from. What I found was a hugely enjoyable sci-fi Western hybrid that deserved a better box office than it got. The cast are all comfortable with each other and very watchable, which isn't surprising since Whedon has transported them all over from ""Firefly"", good move that, while the action quota is high and the black comedy rich.Where the itches start to appear for newcomers like myself, is that it does feel like an extended TV episode. With a twisty plot that sees Whedon cram much into the 2 hour running time, it demands the utmost attention. Which is fair enough to a degree, but many go (or more pertinently would have gone) into ""Serenity"" for a sci-fi action adventure, not for a tickle of the cranium. If this contributed to the poor show at the box office? I'm not sure. But you have to think this really was only made for the die-hard fans of the show.Galling really, because the last third is a ripper of a blockbuster. The action sequences are expertly crafted, the story explodes still further and the principal characters really let loose, particularly the excellent Fillion. Biggest plus of all, the finale doesn't cop out by insulting those who have stayed the course chartered by the good ship Serenity and its crew. It's smart genre film making, a very enjoyable film without doubt, but really it's not got mainstream appeal. Which might suit those die-hards in a selfish kind of why, but that also means we are unlikely to get a sequel. And that's a shame because a newbie like me could easily stand some more of this whizz bangery. 7/10",Serenity
11,Hey_Sweden,I aim to misbehave.,7,30 January 2020,"The crew of a spacecraft named Serenity buy trouble for themselves when they take on two passengers. Simon (Sean Maher) has just rescued his kid sister River (Summer Glau), who's been getting groomed by an evil organization for use as a living weapon. The Serenity captain is a tough, cool Han Solo type named Mal (Nathan Fillion) who transforms from protagonist to genuine hero when his consciousness is raised, and he learns to fight for the greater good.The decent sci-fi / action flick ""Serenity"" was designed by writer / director Joss Whedon (a man who made his name creating TV series like 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer', 'Angel', and 'Firefly') to be a fairly self-contained story that newcomers to the 'Firefly' universe could enjoy. Of course, I'm sure it helps if one has already seen the series, but this is a reasonably entertaining story in its own right.Whedon gives his audience a lot of razzle-dazzle: visual effects, world-building, action scenes, and a blazing pace. There are whole sections of the movie where Whedon barely give the viewers a chance to breathe. The hip, stylized dialogue runs the risk of being annoying, but it never does take top priority. It's fun to take in some of the details here, such as those numerous and unrelenting antagonists known as ""Reavers"", who are cannibalistic savages.Mal and his crew are a colourful, likeable bunch: Zoe (Gina Torres), Jayne (Adam Baldwin, a hoot as a comedy-relief macho character), Kaylee (Jewel Staite), and Wash (played by one of this viewers' favourite actors, Alan Tudyk). They're *not* heroes in the traditional sense, but like their fearless leader, they do learn something about helping their fellow man (and woman). The whole cast is great, with Michael Hitchcock, David Krumholtz, Sarah Paulson, and Ron Glass playing other key characters. Chiwetel Ejiofor is a standout as the brutal, coldly efficient antagonist. This is a man who knows that he does monstrous things, but he simply regards them as things that need to be done.With a nice score by David Newman as accompaniment, ""Serenity"" shows its audience a pretty good time, and may motivate some people to check out 'Firefly' in order to spend some more time with these characters.Seven out of 10.",Serenity
12,poolandrews,Decent enough TV spin-off.,5,31 May 2010,"Serenity is set in the far future where mankind has left Earth to inhabit other worlds, an entire solar system has been terraformed & colonized & is controlled by the Alliance on the central planet. However the outer planets rebel as they fear control, Dr. Simon Tam (Sean Maher) rescues his sister River (Summer Glau) from a secret Alliance laboratory & they both seek refuge on the spaceship Serenity under Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) with various rebels & smugglers. During a business deal River goes crazy & kills lots of people in a bar before Simon stops her, Reynolds then finds out that they are being hunted by a top Alliance assassin (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who has orders to kill River at all costs as she knows top Alliance secrets. River recalls a planet called Miranda which holds a terrible secret the Alliance want kept secret...Written & directed by Joss Whedon this was a spin-off from his short lived one season wonder sci-fi series Firefly which ran for fourteen episodes before being cancelled so quite how this big screen adaptation got made is a mystery since the TV bombed so badly, anyway set six months after Firefly ended Serenity is a fairly enjoyable mix of sci-fi, comedy, action & moralistic quandaries. At two hours in length I did think it went on for too long & although it's always watchable to some degree it can be quite slow. The central issue & heart of Serenity is that old sci-fi staple of Government control, the loss of freedom & those who oppose it as seen so many times before & while it's not groundbreaking here it's a competent & engaging enough story which benefits from some good likable & quirky character's, good exchanges of dialogue & good action scenes. I have never seen any episode of Firefly but by all accounts all the character's are present (even though some get more screen time & feature more prominently than other's) & the sets & look of the series remains intact although several major character's are surprisingly killed off. Even though the big secret the Alliance are trying to keep quiet is about the evil cannibalistic Reavers they oddly get very little screen time, the main villain here is the Alliance & the super cool assassin sent to kill River who should have had more screen time. A good sci-fi film that I am sure fans of the TV series would probably get more out of than a casual watcher like myself.There's plenty of CGI computer effects on show here, the main Serenity ship shaped like a sort of horse just looked daft to me although the effects are generally very good. The action scenes are alright, there's nothing that memorable here but it's well staged. The look of the film is very nice, it's futuristic & sleek without going too over the top. To get a audience friendly PG the violence levels are low & maybe that's why the cannibalistic Reavers don't feature that much despite the entire story revolving around them.With a supposed budget of about $40,000,000 Serenity flopped at the box-office & didn't even make it's production costs back & that includes worldwide box-office takings too. The acting is good but the cast having shot the TV series already had a certain chemistry anyway, Nathan Fillion is great as is Chiwetel Ejiofor although maybe a lack of any star names hurt the box-office appeal.Serenity is a good solid likable sci-fi, it has a sense of humour, good character's & decent action but overall maybe it's a bit lightweight & for those of us who haven't seen the series Firefly this is a nice alternative but maybe we're missing out on something. A good film but not a great one.",Serenity
13,lastliberal,She is startin' to damage my calm.,8,29 December 2007,"I am not a Josh Whedon fan as I have never seen ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Firefly"", or ""Angel."" I am judging the movie on it's own merit, and I found it to be really exciting and a good story.Another story of someone in power thinking that they know what is best for us and manipulating our environment to their own way of thinking. It didn't work here and it doesn't work in real life. I does, however, make for a thrilling premise and a good story.Summer Glau was exceptional as River and I am certainly looking forward to seeing her in ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" next year.Nathan Fillion was also very good, and, of course, one of my favorites, Chiwetel Ejiofor (Kinky Boots, Children of Men).The only negative thing about the whole film was the language. What were those people using? Ebonics? A perfect script diminished by lousy grammar.",Serenity
14,grantss,"Great movie, but it helps a lot if you've seen Firefly",9,17 July 2016,"Picking up a short while after Firefly left off, the crew of the space transport Serenity are harboring a highly sought after fugitive - River, a girl with incredible mental ability and amazing fighting skills. The Alliance, the rulers of the galaxy, have sent one of their top operatives after her. He is a one-man army and will stop at nothing to accomplish his mission. Meanwhile for the crew of Serenity it is business as usual, and that business generally involves smuggling, stealing and doing whatever gets them a payout.After Season 1 of the brilliant series Firefly the show was cancelled. Two years later, as a consolation prize, and in lieu of Season 2, we have the movie Serenity. Follows well from the series and is a great follow-up to it.Not exactly the same vibe as Firefly though, and some of that difference might be put down to Firefly being a TV series and Serenity being a feature film. Firefly was less about action and more about characters - the crew of Serenity, their relationships and how these relationships develop. Serenity is more about action with a nod to the relationships already developed in Firefly.This does make Serenity a bit less engaging than Firefly, though probably more accessible to people who didn't watch Firefly.This said, it helps a lot if you've already watched Firefly. The backstory is only briefly explained at the start of Serenity and there is not enough time in the movie to fill viewers in on the characters' personalities and relationships. So, as a standalone film it is pretty shallow. It does thus rely on the viewer to have seen Firefly to appreciate Serenity.This I can testify to this myself. I originally watched Serenity without seeing Firefly and found it okay but not great (gave it a 6/10). Recently I watched Firefly (found it brilliant) and now have rewatched Serenity. Very different view on it now (9/10).Ultimately, Serenity provides the closure that Firefly never had and is a fantastic conclusion to the series.",Serenity
15,Boba_Fett1138,Stick to television if you can't do movies.,5,3 January 2011,"Problem with most movies that are based on television-series is that they often feel like an extended TV-series episode. And there is also nothing in this movie really that couldn't have been featured in a couple of TV-series episodes. As a matter of fact, it would had probably worked out way better that way.I have never seen a single ""Firefly"" episode, on which this movie got based. So I didn't knew anything about the characters or any of the backgrounds. If I did, I would had probably liked this movie much better. Now instead I just couldn't connect to any of the characters. This is also because in the movie they are being presented as typical cardboard type of characters, who just didn't seem to have anything interesting about them. There were also far more characters than the movie needed really. Again, having all these characters works for a TV-series but just not for a movie of this sort. I still don't know who is being how in this movie or what his or her specialty or purpose within the movie is. The movie was therefore also a quite emotionally bland one to watch.But the movie is also far from being interesting to watch due to its simplistic story. It's being so simplistic that I don't even know what it is all about. It's a story about getting from point A to B, with a young girl who telepathic but what is being the point of it all and why this specific crew helped this girl out and what is exactly being so special about this girl, all is still being a bit of a mystery to me. As a matter of fact, I don't even know what point B was supposed to be. Where were they ever planning on taking this girl to in the first place? To me, the movie and its story seemed like a bit of a mess at times and some stuff seemed to happen at random and characters often popped up out of nowhere, which made it all the more a bigger mess to follow.So, the movie is based on a television-series and this also really shows. The movie does really have a TV look over it, with only some average action and some acceptable looking special-effects, at best. Again, there seems to be nothing in this movie that couldn't had been featured in a television-series episode.Also the acting never surpasses the level of an average television-series. I'm sorry but none of the actors in this movie seemed to be very good ones. I'm still sure they are going to have a great career though...on television, where they belong.Sorry but to me this movie seemed nothing more than an extended television-series episode, that just didn't worked too well as a movie.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Serenity
16,neil-476,Draws a line under the series,9,7 January 2009,"This movie shows what a shame it was to cancel the show so prematurely. Excellent in its own right,it provides some sort of resolution to plot lines which were left dangling, but also illustrates how much better it would have been to have allowed them to be developed and concluded in a less forced timescale.For those unfamiliar with the TV series Firefly, the movie stands alone but is much better if you have seen the series first. And, if you are familiar with the series, at least this movie provides something of a resolution to, in particular, River's story.The cast are all very good, the effects are excellent, and the dialogue is crisp and enjoyable. Only the plot is a little disappointing.",Serenity
17,evanston_dad,A Sleeper Hit,8,6 February 2006,"""Serenity"" is one of those movies that flies in under the radar, quietly plays out its theatrical run, and then slowly but surely builds a solid base of fans and praise until sheer curiosity compels you to see it. I think it's based on something I'm not familiar with: a t.v. show or comic book series or something. And I'm not even a sci-fi/fantasy fan. I CAN enjoy sci-fi, but it has to be of a certain kind. Well, ""Serenity"" is that kind, and I had a lot of fun with it.It's greatest asset as a sci-fi movie is its sense of humour and its refusal to take itself too seriously. Just when things get too geeky or intense, there's a throw-away line or bit of physical comedy tossed in to help you regain your bearings. And the main hero (a Han Solo type) speaks with a strange old cowboy movie dialect (""darlin'"") that takes a while to get used to but adds a sense of fun and silliness once you do.""Serenity"" has an attractive cast with a lot of chemistry between them. And unlike other sci-fi stories, the characters here go beyond simple types easily summarized with a word or two, and instead become full-bodied personalities that you care about, so that when they're put in dangerous situations, you have something vested in what happens to them.The special effects are fine, but they're not what you come away from the movie remembering, which is a compliment. For once, spectacle doesn't drown story.Grade: A",Serenity
18,The_Void,Lots of fun...but not much more,7,10 October 2005,"I have never seen the TV show 'Firefly', but that doesn't matter because writer-director Joss Whedon said himself that the aim of this film is to make non-Firefly fans like it. And nothing went over my head. Like too many modern films, Serenity has too much to live up to. I've heard comments on this film like ""it's the film the latest Star Wars prequel should have been!"" and all the like - and while this is a very enjoyable and visually stunning film, it's also another example of massive over-acclaim. Anyway, judging the film on it's own merits, it's not bad...but hardly a masterpiece either. Simply put, it's too flawed. There's too much focus on sharp dialogue, many sequences defy logic; and there isn't a definite point to the story, making it feel very much like a standard episode of Star Trek et al. The story isn't bad, and tags along a sort of Sci-Fi Western mould. We follow the spaceship Serenity and it's crew. Lead by the Han Solo-like captain Mal; a man more concerned with making as many wisecracks as possible than the safety of his crew, the crew fall foul of the Galactic Empire (it's called 'The Alliance' here...hmmm) when they kidnap a young psychic named River, sister of one of the crew.It's obvious what sort of film Serenity will be after the first fifteen minutes. We start out with a sequence, which indirectly morphs into another - and then another! Then we cut to the central spaceship, and watch the crew as they quip their way through a soon-to-be botched landing. This would be all well and good if Serenity was touted to be another fun little space flick - but as the first fifteen minutes show; there's one or two many Firefly fans attending the cinema these days. The main point of the movie, however, has been left to the special effects department. It's another nail in the 'modern masterpiece' coffin, but the lack of substance definitely is accounted for by the visual element of the film. The space battles look great, and these are topped by the even more impressive ground battles. Of course, it's hard to liken this film to the likes of the original Star Wars trilogy, what with all the CGI that they use nowadays; but at least Serenity has pooled it's resources well. The hand-to-hand fight sequences let it down, thoughvery cold indeed. Writer-director Whedon said himself, after the cancellation of Firefly, that his cast were too good to be cancelled; and that is something that we don't agree on. It's really hard to rate the acting in this film with all the silly lines that the script is riddled with; but really, nobody stands out. Don't get me wrong; I'm not saying that this is a bad film. It's a fun packed two hours - but it's more the visual stunner that it looks like than the important masterpiece that people want it to be.",Serenity
19,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Serenity (2005),8,14 May 2006,"The back story of Serenity and its TV series Firefly is what stuff like soap opera is made of. Created by Joss Whedon, popular creator-scribe of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel television series, the Firefly television series was yanked from the airwaves by Fox midway through its first season, but as all real life fairy tales go, the series was released on DVD, and became an instant cult classic. Hence, the movie was born given the built fan base.And having not watched the Firefly series, I think Serenity is a satisfyingly good sci-fi movie which can stand alone. Although it will take some getting used to the characters, it'll not take too long before you get into the swing of things to enjoy what this movie had to offer. Serenity refers to the Firefly class of spaceships in an era of the future where planets are colonized and banded together as an Alliance, with a band of rebels opposing the oppression of a totalitarian regime. Think of Star Wars scenario of an Empire with its Rebel Alliance, and Star Trek with its ship and crew in focus, combined.We follow the adventures of Captain Malcom Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and his crew of merry men and women (doctor, navigator, pilot, ex-lover etc) as they undergo a rescue mission of one of their own, River Tam, who's a psychic turned dangerous weapon, or so they think. While they unravel the mystery and secrets of what River knows, they must outrun the ruthless Allaince's assassin who's after River, as well as fend off the deadly vicious creatures known as the Reavers.The Reavers are extremely dangerous folk, and I kinda liken them to Star Trek's Borg - they keep coming like zombies, and are known to rape and murder. The pacing is kept very tight, with witty dialogue flying all round. Humour is peppered throughout and you'll never know when it'll hit, even up to the very last frame (no, I'm not kidding here).The production sets, though most are CGI, are really very pretty to look at, and the advanced world they live in, is an amalgamation of American and Chinese, so much so that the characters also spout (sometimes intelligible) Chinese phrases. There are memorable moments in the movie, though the action fights are quite ordinary, save for River's battle with the Reavers which seem to beat Aeon Flux's and Ultraviolet's hands down. Her storyline did thread very closely to resemble that of Leeloo's in Fifth Element though.Filled with deep characterization, Serenity will make you want to get your hands on the TV series to indulge in more adventures of the space crew. After watching this 2 hour movie, it's no wonder why Firefly has fast become a cult favourite. Too bad the movie didn't get a wide release locally (only a GV Surprise Screening and another one-off at Prince), which will probably serve to extend its popularity here. Good, interesting Sci-Fi, must watch.Code 1 DVD comes chock full of extras. There's a full length feature film commentary by Joss Whedon, plenty of deleted scenes with Whedon's commentary, lots of outtakes, an laced- with-humour introduction by Whedon, three documentaries - 1. Future History: The Story of Earth That Was, 2. Re-lighting the Firefly, and 3. What's in a Firefly, and an easter egg too, which showed the creation of that weird Fruity Oaty bar advertisement containing the sublime message ala The Manchurian Candidate.",Serenity
20,Mr-Fusion,"Whedon's first time out, and it's a great one.",8,14 June 2012,"""Firefly"" is one of my very favorite TV shows, and in my opinion features Joss Whedon's best creative work. So let's get it out right now that I'm biased towards a big screen incarnation of the undeservingly canceled show. That Whedon was able to take an axed property to a major Hollywood studio (Universal) and actually get funding for it is pretty incredible. What's even more remarkable is just how good ""Serenity"" is.We find Capt. Malcolm Reynolds and crew (aboard the titular mercenary ship) in dire straits. The only work that can be found is illegal, good-paying jobs are hard to come by (as well as keeping the crew well-stocked in food), and the mentally-unbalanced teenage sister of the ship's doctor is harboring a deadly secret that the totalitarian Planetary Alliance would very much like to kept swept under the carpet. It's a story that tests the familial relationships among the crew as well as Mal's grit as his foundering leadership is in question.Two major questions arising from the show are addressed: 1)the cause of River's deteriorating mental state and 2)the origins of the cannibalistic Reavers. These are two fairly major plot threads that were never clarified on the small screen, and it's impressive that they are finally attended to (in a larger medium, no less). And when we're not looking for those answers, there's plenty of character development to go around. Whedon's script is chock full of his signature sense of humor we've come to expect from these characters, and we care about every single one of them (especially when they come to harm). His first time out as movie director proves that he knows exactly what he's doing, keeping things moving at near-breakneck speed, while still giving time for these actors to turn in great performances.As an adaptation from a small-screen property, ""Serenity"" really is a terrific movie. The ship that fans grew to love on TV benefits from suped-up production design (tracking shots through the actual corridors and bowels of the craft), Everyone involved gets their share of face time, and it's just an all around well-executed production. The story is left open to future entries - but even if that doesn't come to pass, this was a fine note to go out on. 8/10",Serenity
21,siderite,Worthy film for Firefly,9,17 September 2016,"There is no point in watching the film without seeing the Firefly series from which it has spun off. I was lucky to first binge on the TV show and then watch the film, which is my recommendation for all of you, as the movie feels like an beefed up episode to tie up loose ends.I liked Firefly - can't say loved - because of its original take on a sci-fi show. Yes, it is basically outlaws in space, but God is in the details. The actors have chemistry, the script is very well written with scenes and dialogues that are both deep and witty - as they should always be. The only issues were clearly tied with budget, although it was a fine show nonetheless.Serenity is clearly better in regards to budget, scope and I dare say development. It also wraps up nicely the more subtle theme of the show, that of rebelling against oppression and being true to yourself, no matter who that really is. The film disregards said subtlety and instead shows what Malcolm Reynolds is truly like when he goes to war.Overall I had some qualms with the movie that are normal for this type: the obvious foreshadowing, the tools that pop up nicely when you need them. It's something interesting stories need, but that in the end become made entirely out of and feel like cake icing that no one bothered to bake the cake for. Other than that, good film. I am actually surprised that after its release someone didn't pick up Firefly again and all we are left with now is Con Man.",Serenity
22,disdressed12,"not exactly my bag, but still well done",6,2 November 2007,"i'm not sure,but it think this movie may be related to the TV series,Firefly or at least have a similar style.if that's the case,it would probably be better to be familiar with the show before watching the movie.i have not seen the show,so that may explain why i didn't get the movie.or not.anyway,i don't think Serenity is a bad movie.in fact,i think it's well done.it looks great,and there are some amazing fight sequences.nevertheless,i couldn't follow it.the dialogue was different,sort what i would expect to hear during the Civil War era or in the old west.so, some of the things they talked about,i wasn't quite sure what they meant or what context to put things in.anyway,this movie wasn't really my bag,but i think fans of Firefly and a lot of general science fiction fans will enjoy it.for me,even though it's not my cup of tea,i'd still have to give Serenity a 6/10,because it is so well done.but that's just my opinion.",Serenity
23,Buddy-51,OK at times but too indebted to Star Wars,6,27 August 2006,"""Serenity"" is writer/director Joss Whedon's theatrical film follow-up to his defunct TV series, ""Firefly."" I have never seen the original show so I have no idea how a fan would be likely to react to this film. As a newbie, however, I can only report that ""Serenity"" might have been a bit more fun if it didn't look and feel quite so much like a ""Star Wars"" wannabe. Instead of the ""Empire,"" here we have the ""Alliance"" as the mega-force against which the rebel forces are fighting. The twist in this case is that the rebels have been forced to give up their more noble aspirations of overthrowing a repressive regime and have turned to what amounts to inter-galactic bank robbery and payroll heists to put food on the table after suffering a defeat in the war with the Alliance. Malcolm Reynolds' transport ship, Serenity, is the equivalent of Han Solo's Millennium Falcon, with its rogue passengers doing battle with the evil forces of not only the Alliance but some carnivorous creatures known as Reavers.The story begins with a 17-year old girl named River, who possesses psychic powers, being brainwashed at the hands of ruthless scientists working for the Alliance. After her brother, Doc, rescues her from the laboratory, the two of them seek refuge on the Serenity, a ship whose crew is unaware of River's troublesome background. Soon, the captain, Mal, and his cohorts are plunged into a battle with the Alliance forces who are attempting to destroy River at any and all costs. Again, as in ""Star Wars,"" the ship and its crew engage in an intergalactic chase with a force much bigger and more powerful that they somehow must find a way to defeat. There's even a scene so reminiscent of the Luke-I-Am-Your-Father encounter in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" that I half expected the combatants to whip out their light sabers at any moment.Despite the feeling of déjà vu that permeates the work, ""Serenity"" has a few fun moments involving the characters' interactions with one another. The rebels aboard the Serenity are not always prime candidates for heroism, often acting as much out of fear and self-interest as righteousness and courage. The acting is generally wooden, but the plotting is intriguing enough to sustain our interest through most of the movie. The special effects are a mite below par for what one would expect to find in a sci-fi film today, but Whedon pushes the action along fast enough to keep us distracted from some of the weaknesses in the visuals.This is definitely a mixed bag when it comes to science fiction entertainment. The dialogue ranges from the sharp to the cheesy, as does virtually everything else in the movie. It makes for OK viewing, but, in all honesty, you'd be better off popping ""Star Wars"" into the DVD player and watching the real thing instead.",Serenity
24,thesar-2,"Serenity, Now!",8,4 September 2010,"I sincerely took a chance on Serenity, for not only have I not seen the show, Firefly, I knew absolutely nothing the basic plot, the characters or anything tied to the short-lived TV series other than it's Sci-Fi and, well, that's it.This is an unfortunate side-effect of marketing, and eventually the movie, itself. For one, I study movies, even ones I've never seen or intend to. Eh, it's more of an obsession than hobby, so for me not to know one additional thing, other than the Sci-Fi aspect and it spawned from a then defunct cult-TV series, it's pretty poor advertising that was step one of the movie's weak box-office and viewings by the public. Not to mention, the name change from Firefly to Serenity couldn't have helped. Also, being a newcomer, I spent the better half of the movie trying hard to get to know the crew of the Serenity ship. It never appeared like this was made for ANYONE but those who are familiar with the show.Per shame. I almost gave up half-way through. And luckily, I didn'tit was about to get a whole lot better in the second half through to the end. For that, I am grateful I watched it.Like I said, once you get past who's who, what they do, why they do it, where they're fromhold on, this was a lot of work to ""catch up"" on a series 1/1000th the viewings of Star Trekand the somewhat corny lines – some worked, most didn't – you can finally relax and get into a decent story and a helluva lot of action.I don't want to seem like I'm completely criticizing the movie, for at the conclusion, it's not hard to see Serenity makes Star Wars look like an AGES 5-7 movie and Star Trek an unrealistic fantasy of the future. Despite the corniness that's spread throughout – I'm seeing Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Fillion) as a cross between James T. Kirk, Indiana Jones and Jack T. Colton (Romancing the Stone) thrown in for good measure – it's a pretty grown up Sci-Fi Action/Adventure that involves no aliens and multiple deaths, including ones you'd never suspect.Let's back up. A Sci-Fi Action/Adventure set in the far reaches of spaceand no aliens? Hallelujah! Not that I'm bashing Sci-Fi Alien films, I do like them, but what a refreshing and original take. RARELY will any filmmaker have the balls to reject the ancient alien-on-the-ship routines. And despite somewhat-plausible mutants and a psychic – River (Glau), it's one of the few realistic Sci-Fi movies ever. Bravo.SoIn the far-distant future of Earth-relocating into new worlds, we have this renegade group of thieves on a junk yard of a ship who take on a girl, River and her brother, doctor Simon (Maher) and inadvertently begin an adventure while A: trying to stay alive & hidden, B: solving a mystery and C: growing.I didn't really attach myself on any one character in the opening; I am a bit of a Trekkie, and since these are the anti-Enterprise crew members, I was very skeptical at first. The ""C"" from above is just one aspect that I really liked. The growth of everyone, but namely the Captain, was a wonderful addition. I mean, it was hard to like him, even when he tries to be coy with his one-liners. Doing the right thing is as foreign to him as the Alliance he so hates.And this Alliance does mimic a darker version of Star Trek's Federation meshed with ""The Company"" from the Alien films, so it's not exactly unique. No matter, what it lacks in originality, it makes up with a human, though he acts more like an android or Sith, in the form of The Operative (Ejiofor) who was one of the best aspects of the movie. He does ""what he thinks best for the overall picture"" despite being a self-proclaimed monster. Also, he wields a steal sword that I'm not quite sure if its homage to the lightsaber.As I said prior, I did almost give up – something I am known for doing .08% of the time – but I'm glad I didn't. The graphics were sublime, the fight sequences – namely from River – exciting and it had one large space battle that trumped Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith's opening scene. And that movie came out mere months before this one.While I did like the Episode III's opening – this one flew right past it. I think it has something to do with the realism and this scene/movie did NOT contain the tragedy of bad acting George Lucas demanded from his leads. Sure, Serenity had its share of unbearable jokes/lines, at least they left them out of this one scene (you'll know what I am talking about when you see the giant cloud in space) whereas Lucas felt fit in adding his signature toddler humor and acting while they shot Episode III's space battle opening.What can I say? I would suspect around 150 people actually saw this movie in the theatres, and I doubt more on DVD. I HIGHLY recommend this feature. Though not perfect, it's completely worth a viewing for any Sci-Fi buffs looking for a more grown-up space saga.",Serenity
25,cherold,if the series had been this entertaining I would have kept watching,8,16 August 2006,"I didn't shed any tears when Firefly was canceled. I saw the first two or three episodes and then I gave up on it; the central mystery of the crazy girl was interesting but the individual episodes were slowly paced and bland.With the episodic structure gone, Serenity takes Firefly's central mystery and runs with it, creating a fast-paced, consistently entertaining sci-fi western.The movie is a lot of fun, with sharp dialog and pretty good acting (especially the assassin played by Chiwetel Ejiofor), but like Star Wars, there's really not much to it beyond surface flash. Which is okay, since I'm a sucker for good surface flash, but it does mean this cannot be called great science fiction; just very good action.While I enjoyed the movie a great deal, it does contain one of the central flaws of the series; the characters are a little bland, except for Gina Torres and the aforementioned Ejiofor. Nathan Fillion is a decent dashing hero, but he lacks the panache of a Harrison Ford or Errol Flyn. The crazy girl is an interesting concept but the actress doesn't have much to do except look fretful, and her brother is painfully bland. The other couple of women are likable but really don't have much to do. And the big tough guy, I almost forgot to even mention him.It seems Whedon's concept of a sci-fi western included using typical western stock characters, and I think that was a mistake. You can't have a good series full of two-dimensional heroes. But it actually works pretty good in a fast-paced action flick.",Serenity
26,FeastMode,my notes,1,26 July 2019,"Absolute trash. this is tv quality made into a movie. and not good tv quality like hbo, showtime, or even fx/tnt/usa. trash network tv quality. i barely gave it a chance since i hated the show. i didn't finish it (1 viewing)",Serenity
27,Robert_duder,Step Aside Star Wars and Star Trek...make room for Serenity!!!,10,3 October 2005,"I admit it...I was a Firefly fan. Joss Whedon creates more than a story, an entire world. He is the most intense and gifted writer and he holds no punches. If a character needs to die...he'll do it...no matter what the outcome. If it's twists and surprises you're after Whedon will deliver. Firefly, I think, was so unique. Sci-fi is a crowded genre and yet he managed to make it something completely new. It was a world of the future forced back into the past by a civil war against The Alliance and the less conformed people, the rebels so to speak. The character of Malcolm Reynolds who was a heroic war leader is a brilliant protagonist. His moral compass is definitely off kilter but he has a very specific brand of justice and morality in his own right. The unusual mix of the old west with the future science fiction was brilliant and Firefly was so open to so many different stories and things to find out which is why it was so devastating to have it stopped. Whedon vowed he wouldn't let his creation go unfinished....and he tackled the near impossible...he took a small cult TV show and brought it to the big screen in Serenity. If anyones vision can do it, it'd be Whedon's as he helms direction and writing for the big screen. Did he accomplish it?? MIND BLOWINGLY YES!!! This is quite possibly one of the best science fiction films I have ever seen. It held in tact everything that made the TV Series so wonderful. He didn't hesitate to pick up the story three years after the show ended and he did it in such a way that movie goers wouldn't have to have seen Firefly to enjoy it. But if you've seen both you're in for even more of a treat. Whedon basically wraps up everything from the series, a perfect last call. I didn't expect that. I thought and hoped that Serenity would be the beginning of an Epic series on the big screen (and it could very well still be) but Whedon didn't care about that, he wanted to give his characters the world he created their finale.Serenity doesn't go over the top with big budget, in fact it's not a far cry from what the TV Series was and that's okay. Modesty!! Even with a more modest budget and special effects the film is mind blowing because of the story and characters. The action scenes and space fights are intense!!! And the worlds and ships they inhabit are perfectly created and leave you craving to know more about what's out there (sequels!!!) The cast of Serenity is the exact same cast, every single person from the TV Series, which is just awesome. None of them are overly familiar with being a big screen actor. Take lead actor Nathan Fillion, despite some minor roles in big movies this is really a leap into the lime light and he's wonderful. Mal Reynolds is the equivalent any day to Luke Skywalker or Captain Kirk. His character is full of depth and emotion and he is a tough son of a bitch to boot. You hate him, root for him, love him, just like his crew. This could be Fillion's big breakthrough. Gina Torres who plays Zoe, Mal's second in command. In the TV Series there was some tension there because Zoe always felt indebted to Mal no matter how morally estranged their missions were and it always upset her husband. They left this little detail behind in the film which is okay. Some things have to be left in order to transition to big screen. Torres is great, she's tough as nails and a good actress but I didn't think they used her all that much in Serenity. Alan Tudyk plays Zoe's husband and driver of The Serenity ""Wash."" His character is a little underused but he's a good guy, and gets a lot of the one liners. The lovely Morena Baccarin playing Mal's love interest Inara. She does a good job in her role and her and Fillion have a good chemistry and they build a good start at future romance. One of the more seasoned actors of the group is Adam Baldwin. He plays tough mercenary Jayne. His character is fantastic and could hold his own film. Jayne is a seemingly self centered war driven muscle man but Whedon gives the character great humor and always a hero type story line. Jewel Staite plays the mechanic Kaylee who is in love with the doctor. She's trustworthy and strong and a good female lead. Sean Maher plays the doctor who is desperate to protect his sister at any costs. And that begins the real focus of this particular installment in the Firefly legacy. River...played brilliantly by Summer Glau. She does amazing action sequences and her character is so emotionally torn between being this void like robot and her real inner self. She holds the secrets to the Universe and everyone is tearing her apart. Her story is captivating and there could be much more to her in the future.Needless to say I believe the characters are everything in Joss Whedon's world and he creates them with such believability. This film, Serenity, is on par with anything George Lucas has done. I was a little sad that they ended the story with the character Shepherd Book played by Ron Glass. In the TV series his story was becoming even more dominant than River's and I was dying to find out more about Book but it may never happen now. Nonetheless Serenity is brilliance, simple brilliance. The sarcastic humorist style of Whedon is my favorite and the action is non stop. If you're a sci-fi fan, or a Firefly or Whedon fan you NEED to see Serenity, it will be a classic. It's perfection in space. 10/10",Serenity
28,dromasca,"real fun, but for science-fiction fans only",6,14 February 2006,"That's one of the most interesting rating on IMDb that I have seen. 8 is a very high average, close to the top 250, and the explanation must be that fans of the TV series voted in masses here. Although I am a science-fiction books and movies fan I did not see the TV series. I suspect that this actually may be a problem, because some of the action and characters could be easier to understand for people having seen the series. Still, 'Serenity' is good fun for science-fiction fans, but far from being a masterpiece.The TV roots of the film are quite visible. Director Joss Whedon was involved in the creation of the big teen vs. vampires hits 'Buffy' and 'Angel', but 'Serenity is closer to the Gene Rodenderry material, with a touch of 'Profiler' and some cosmic politics of the Star Wars genre. It's good TV stuff overall, fair acting, and well developed characters. Nothing is too spectacular here, special effects are best one can do with low budget, and the pace gives quality and keeps the interest high for the whole duration (almost two hours) of the movie.Released in the same summer entertainment window as big budget films in the same genre from Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, 'Serenity' does not fall badly beyond as a science-fiction action movie. This tells a lot, and fans of the genre will love it, even if they are not the 'Serenity' TV series fans. However, I doubt that the film can attract film lovers out of the science fiction fans circle.",Serenity
29,ThomasDrufke,World Without Sin,8,13 May 2014,"I waited a few months before watching Serenity after finishing my Firefly binge-watch because I was underwhelmed with what the show offered. It's cancellation was most likely the main reason that show never came to be Whedon really wanted, so after waiting a few years to make the movie, he delivered on an epic Sci-Fi adventure.The biggest reason why this movie works is the dedication and depth to other parts of this world we didn't discover in the show. I loved that we found out more about how River got to be who she was, and even the Reavers as well. It's the back story we all wanted with the show. The show's main flaw is that there isn't an overarching story that gets you to come back and watch every week. With weak effects and no elements of intrigue you get a canceled T.V. show. But Whedon does everything right with Serenity. He brings back all the characters we fell in love with on the show, continues the bickering between the crew, but also adds in a terrifying villain.Chiwetel Ejiofor shines in his role as 'The Operative', although the character comes off as bland, he does show heart towards the end. Firefly never gave us a villain we remembered, which is what makes Serenity that much better. I also like that even people seeing the movie without ever watching Firefly would understand the premise of the film. In the first five minutes Whedon perfectly introduces us to the characters and their various roles. Although i would have liked to see more time put into some of the main characters' deaths. It's beyond me that nobody went to see this in theaters. Perhaps if they committed it to be more of a blockbuster, and spent more on effects and budget the movie would made more.The hopes for sequels and continuations can be virtually thrown out the window, but this film does give us a satisfying conclusion to the short lived space-western.+ Whedon's beloved characters+ Satisfying end + Reavers and River Backstory Weak effects Quick deaths, no time for grief8.3/10",Serenity
30,ericstevenson,"I love you, Nathan Fillion!",10,16 March 2018,"This is a continuation of what is regarded as one of the best TV shows ever made, ""Firefly"". It's a true pity that it was cancelled before its first season was even over! Luckily, they were nice enough to give us a movie afterwards. I admit that one main reason why I love this film so much is because it stars Nathan Fillion, one of my favorite actors! I guess I can regret not seeing him at that Atlanta Con. Anyway, I never watched the original show.Of course, there wasn't much of an original show to watch. From the very first three minutes of this movie, I was hooked. It's mostly because it starts out by giving the audience a fakeout and then a fakeout for the fakeout! It's kind of like ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" where the action just keeps on going and going. It's of course helped by wonderful acting. I also love all the haunting nightmarish imagery in the film.My only complaint is that it does kind of drag on in the middle. I feel bad for not knowing anything about these characters because I could have associated with them more. Of course, a movie this good makes it so that you don't need to watch the show to truly love it. I never saw a single episode of ""Star Trek"" and I still loved those movies. This is the best movie I have seen for TV Month! I'm just that much a Nathan Fillion fanboy. ****",Serenity
31,lesleyharris30,"A Mostly Disappointing Affair,",6,10 July 2016,"Serenity is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed plot and stellar performances. The original cast of the short lived series Firefly are still in great form here, even after being separated from their characters for some time before filming this movie, the likes of Nathan Fillion and Morena Baccarin are so convincing, it is as if they never stopped playing them. As for the overall story, it was disappointing, it did not grab my attention and engross me in to this universe half as much as the television series did. As well as that, several character arch's and lots of loose ends from the series are left untied in this, which I would have assumed was its main objective, to wrap everything up. Its biggest downfall is that it tries too hard to be bigger than the series, losing the western vibe in favour of more space travel and adventure, making it feel like any other Sci-Fi, taking away what made Firefly original and fun in the first place. Despite a top notch cast, Serenity is mostly a let down, fans of Firefly should still check it out and form their own opinion, but I would not recommend it as a good Sci-Fi film. The crew of a spaceship clash with inter-planetary rulers after picking up two fugitives. Best Performance: Nathan Fillion",Serenity
32,A_Different_Drummer,Over 1500 reviews and still not even a 10 score?,10,28 November 2013,".. which is some sort of a record. Makes you wonder what the armchair reviewers are saving the ""10"" for ...? A sign from above? Godfather XIX? Here are the unvarnished facts, purely for the historical record. Joss ""Long Arc"" Whedon was doing his thing, happily building a show (Firefly) that, typical of Whedon, was getting better and better and better. Then they took his show away. Now, Joss has a history of dealing with people who take his toys away (see the first horrific Buffy feature, and his reaction thereto). Somehow, using the Whedon magic, he was able to gather all his notes for the 10-year arc of Firefly and use them surgically, in this film on a single strike. Ah, what a film. Understand that Joss is one of the greatest living writers of our generation, and for him this was ""personal"" -- he wanted to show the world what they almost missed. From the opening sequence to the last frame, this is a perfect movie. Citizen Kane watch your back. This is flawless. It should be studied in film school and buried in a time capsule with the original Brylcreem formula. The recycling of an already perfect ensemble cast from Firefly was expected, but the addition of Chiwetel Ejiofor, who steals every frame of every scene he is in, was inspired. As as I hinted before, if you did not give this a 10, you need to seriously rethink whether Talking Pictures is your preferred form of entertainment.",Serenity
33,Bored_Dragon,"The final episode of ""Firefly""",7,6 December 2016,"Watching this right after watching Firefly in two days, I cannot objectively say if this movie can stand for itself and have any sense to people who are not familiar with Firefly. Basically, this is just one more episode of the show, great finale meant to be the conclusion for the good show that ended way too soon. It gives us answers to some questions about things that Firefly had no chance to bring to their conclusions and it would be a good ending for the show even if it was not canceled and had many seasons instead. The movie is not great, but it was necessary for sure. Firefly was not so much about space action and adrenaline as it was about characters that were real and convincing and that we could relate to, characters we fell in love with even after just dozen of episodes this show lasted. This movie brings back those characters and gives us a conclusion after the show simply stopped out of nowhere and left us missing them badly. Now it's easier to move on. I do not consider this show or ending movie to be great, but it gets under your skin and you simply have to love it. So it is hard to rate it...7,5/10",Serenity
34,tabuno,A Delight Space Adventure Romp,8,23 January 2019,"1 October 2005. A hyper-intense movie version along the lines of the television series Andromeda - the floor vibrating with exciting noisy energy. Serenity actually starts with a serious somber explosive beginning and then introduces the audience to the lighter television episodic theme which flows into a full feature movie. The action is good, the special effects adequate and interesting, the plot is solid, the evil operative a cool, sinister character. The movie pushes the sci fi envelop some, but never succeeds in going where no man as gone before but incorporates the echoes of Star Trek, The Matrix (1999), Aeon Flux (2005), and Hannah (2011) and other scripts that are crafted well together to make the movie its own original making. An elevated Eight out of Ten Stars.",Serenity
35,paulclaassen,Forgettable...,4,17 March 2020,"'Serenity' is the continuation of a cancelled TV series, 'Firefly'. If the series failed, my logic thinking ability tells me a film won't be a success, either, so I can't understand who greenlit this film. Needless to say, it was not a box office success...There's just so much wrong with this film. Firstly, the dialogue. There's so much dialogue here that doesn't mean anything or make sense - like a song with random lyrics. The film is also far too comedic to be taken seriously, and it gets carried away with its inventions and visual effects. It is overbearing and overpowering in almost every scene. Much of the film is beyond comprehension.'Serenity' takes so many detours in its plot that one actually forgets what the film is all about. (What was it about again?). River is also too much in the background for a film to supposedly revolve around her, and then steps in the limelight only when the story requires it. Nathan Fillion as Mall did not feel strong enough to carry the film.
I still honestly have no idea what the film was about. Maybe it would have made more sense if I followed 'Firefly', but as someone who didn't, this left me scratching my head in confusion. Just like 'Jupiter Ascending', they tried so hard to be too clever that it ended up far too complicated.I'll remember 'Serenity' as a forgettable film.",Serenity
36,sol-,Complex Future,4,3 April 2016,"Set several hundred years in the future, the crew of spacecraft finding themselves facing unexpected danger as they discover that a seemingly innocuous telepathic teenager, who they have rescued from assassination, has been trained as a deadly killing machine with the power to kill them all if her latent talents are activated. In addition to this very decent premise, 'Serenity' is crammed full of interesting ideas on topics as varied as overpopulation, terraforming, subliminal messages and manipulating human emotions. All these great ideas though tend to get lost along the way as the film is crafted as an action thriller first and foremost with twice as many explosive combat moments as exposition scenes. The film is spun off from a television series ('Firefly') by the same writer-director, Joss Whedon, and it is entirely possible that the plot might make more sense to someone familiar with the series. For someone who has never seen the series though, there is a bit too much go on, and without a good grasp on the characters' backgrounds and the futuristic setting, it is hard to appreciate the set pieces and feel for the plight of the characters. Summer Glau provides an impressive performance either way though as the deadly telepathic teen; though a bit old for the role, she has quiet, mysterious quality to her. It is also fun to see 'Death at a Funeral''s Alan Tudyk in a more serious (though hardly humourless) role. The special effects and newfangled sets are quite impressive too and the film ends on a solid note too even if it is a bit of a bumpy ride.",Serenity
37,briancham1994,Exciting follow-up,7,2 June 2020,"This is an exciting and worthy follow-up to the Firefly series. The action scenes are great as always. I liked all the new environments, the assassin, the battles and the backstory of the Reavers.",Serenity
38,Thanos_Alfie,Protection...,6,15 November 2020,"""Serenity"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch a crew of a spaceship called Serenity trying to evade the military since they have a secret weapon that they want. They have to protect that weapon because if the military get it a lot of things will change and that's something nobody wants.I liked this movie because it had an interesting plot, much of action and suspense that made it even more interesting. The interpretations of Chiwetel Ejiofor who played as The Operative, Nathan Fillion who played as Mal and Summer Glau who played as River were very good and I believe that all of them made the difference. The direction which was made by Joss Whedon who is also the writer, was very good and I liked the way he presented both the whole concept of the movie and the main characters of it. Lastly, I have to say that ""Serenity"" is a good movie with a simple but nice plot, and I am sure tha you will have a great time if you choose to watch it.",Serenity
39,zkonedog,A Microcosm Of The Series Itself,7,6 March 2017,"While watching the ""Firefly"" TV series, I was only so-so about the show after the first couple episodes. Then it started growing on me and by the end I was really drawn into the characters. That is the same basic pattern, ironically enough, for this follow-up movie ""Serenity""...starting up slow but building momentum with every passing scene.For a basic plot summary, ""Serenity"" sees Mal (Nathan Fillion) and his crew ""still flying"". The focus this time is on River Tam (Summer Glau), who is being pursued by an operative of the Alliance (Chiwetel Ejiofor). Along the way, Mal & Co. have in a few rough scrapes, learn much more about the psychotic Revers, and ultimately make a decision that will define their overall mission.Half-way through ""Serenity"", I was thoroughly unimpressed and thinking a 2-star review would be in order. The characters seemed different from where the TV show left off and I was having a difficult time meshing the two things together. Of course, Joss Whedon was given a very difficult assignment here by having to introduce a new audience to already-established characters. So, for more season ""Firefly"" viewers, the first hour seems a bit disjointed and strange.The last 45 minutes or so, though, are truly incredible and showcase everything that is good about the entire ""Firefly"" concept. The characters come together and begin interacting as a team again, the humor is at the right pitch, and the gritty nature of the future is never more apparent. What was very much a middling effort is turned into a great cinematic experience in the span of just under an hour.Though ""Firefly"" was never given a true send-off from FOX (instead being cancelled just when it seemed things were getting good), ""Serenity"" provides a very nice coda to such a well-written, well-imagined series. The character ""re-development"" is a bit strange, but once things settle down this flick tells one of the better ""Firefly"" stories in the show's canon.",Serenity
40,Floated2,Wasn't interested,2,24 January 2011,"Having not seen the television show ""Firefly"", I cannot properly judge the film based on that. I will base Serenity solely on its own merit, as a stand a lone film. Having said that, I personally found Serenity to be quite boring, overlong and not as much action as I was anticipating- especially from reading positive critic reviews. Maybe its because I haven't seen an episode from the show, that I didn't find the film humorous, exciting and fun. I liked the special effects but they were pretty basic and I've seen better effects and visuals in plenty of Sci-Fi films. Serenity's plot line is somewhat confusing to follow. Ill be honest, I didn't quite understand it at first, then as I continued watching, it made a little more sense to me. Maybe you need to be a fan of the show to quite get some of its subtle humour and appreciate some of those subtleties, but speaking from someone who hasn't seen the show, I don't really understand the hype coming from fans about the film. I found some parts okay but for the most part, I was bored and was waiting for the film to end. I also didn't really care about the characters, and didn't feel any less pain when a character died. Overall, this film is probably enjoyed by its fans of the show- much less regular moviegoers.",Serenity
41,digitalbeachbum,Sci Fi meets cowboys,8,6 August 2018,"Serenity was originally a television show on the FOX network back in the early 2002-2003 era. It was created by Josh Whedon. It ran for one season before stupid executives for FOX cut it from their lineup. One of the dumbest, moronic things I've seen from executives who have their heads up their asses.The show is original and provides a fantastic cast. It has great writing for the scripts of the television show and as well, the movie. The special effects are good enough, but not the best. The plots are solid. The dialog filled with one liners. Minor love interests. Action. A conclusion which is left unfinished and unfortunately will never have a proper ending.The movie does have some issues but them are minor and don't break the viewers ability to suspend reality to enjoy the show or movie. Space cowboy/rebels left over from a Civil War attempting to make a living on the outskirts of space away from the government which is corrupt and dominating.There is a lot of unsolved and resolved issues in the story but with this movie and the series you get enough of the picture to know what is going on with the characters and their past.Eveyone should enjoy this movie except for the kids. There is some violence and blood in the movie and there is also a lot of adult themes.Overall I rate this as one of the better movies in my collection. It makes my top 25 movie list.",Serenity

44,Vartiainen,Deserving finale to one of the greatest scifi TV series,7,6 January 2014,"To this day, fans of science fiction rate the discontinuation of Firefly as one of the most bawling and worst mistakes in television history. Conceived by the inimitable Joss Whedon, Firefly followed the noble tradition of depicting space as the next great frontier - it actually was just as good as a western as it was as scifi - but it did it with its own spin, with great characters, clever dialogue and surprisingly decent special effects. The individual stories had their ups and downs, but you could see the promise and the potential for growth and future story lines. Unfortunately, the series was cancelled after the first season. The reasons varied, but the harsh truth was the there would be no more Firefly, no more Captain Malcolm Reynolds, no more Zoë or other crew members.Joss Whedon wanted to give the fans at least some closure, which eventually led to this film. Serenity has the feel of a TV movie in that it feels like an extra long episode. It does a good job of introducing its premise and characters to those that are just getting in, but it's still much better if you've seen the series first.And for what this movie is, it's very good. We return to the main conflicts of the film, once again stepping onto Serenity as she flies throughout the distant solar system, carrying her crew from one adventure to another. Most of our favourite characters come back for a final hurrah and in the end we are provided with enough answers to satisfy our curiosity and to leave us content.That's not to say that it's not a good movie in its own right. The world of Firefly is given a visual update with movie level budget, the action works beautifully, all the characters are just as good as in the series and as a whole it's very enjoyable experience. Even the villain is properly menacing.My only real negative is that they tried to cover a bit too much ground with the plot. The foundation for the story was laid in the series and you could see then that it was supposed to form an overarching plot several seasons long. To try and squeeze all that into a movie only a few hours long is a taunting task, and while Whedon does a really good job, it still feels a bit rushed. Could have been a lot worse, however, and the plot in no way ruins the movie. It's just a damn shame that we couldn't have enough time to properly uncover and examine these mysteries.Serenity is a must-watch for any fan of Firefly. It has the exact same feel as the series and as an individual episode it belongs among the best. As a movie it falls just short of being great, but is still easily recommended for all fans of science fiction and action.",Serenity
45,JohnSeal,Absolutely bloody baffling,3,26 September 2006,"Prior to screening Serenity, I had only the vaguest idea of what it was. Of course, I knew it was 'science fiction', and I knew it was based on a television series that I'd never seen. I also knew the series had a sizable following, and I foolishly thought this meant it might actually be good. Well, perhaps it is--but the movie sure ain't. The crew of characters manning the Serenity are completely bland and unengaging, and the story is baffling for those of us unfamiliar with the series. In addition, Jack N. Green's cinematography is absolutely horrible, as he swings his camera back and forth from character to character as they utter their banal dialogue. This is quite odd, considering Green has done sterling work on behalf of Clint Eastwood. On the plus side of the ledger, it's always good to see Chiwetel Ejiofor in anything, even when he's given next to nothing to do, and David Newman's score is quite good if a bit sparse. Padded to a numbing two hours, Serenity left me scratching my head. Perhaps I'm just too old for this stuff--and perhaps I'd better stick to reviewing obscure art-house oddities and Jess Franco movies.",Serenity
46,GOWBTW,Enjoyed this piece of work!,9,25 June 2007,"""Serenity"" is one of the few scifi/fantasy films I have ever seen. The scene of space has never been interesting. I liked the way they had the spaceship made. And the characters, they are top-notched. The crew consists of a leader of a resistance named Mal(Nathan Fillion) who happens to hold a prodigy fighter named River(Summer Glau) who happens to be very dangerous to anyone who gets in her way. She has the a potent memory, and her fighting skills are top of its class. She takes out anyone, anywhere, anyplace, at anytime. Then you got this leader of the Alliance known as The Operative(Chiwitel Ejiofor) is very merciless, and very lethal. His sword is what I like in the movie. I liked the scene where he let the doctor land on the sword after he got him with that nerve strike. Then you got these freaks known as the Reavers. They seem to be the worst of the bunch. The crew of ""Serenity"" seems to have difference of opinions when it comes to survival. After finding about the poison gas these researchers have found, they learned the hard way that the cure didn't turned out the way they hoped for. It was a very fun movie and the choreography is amazing. Worth the watch! 4 out of 5 stars!",Serenity
47,Polaris_DiB,Takes what's given and does what it must,6,23 April 2007,"Despite the popularity of Firefly, even if Fox hadn't had screwed it up, I figure the series had maybe three or four seasons max to it. In a way, it's actually a stroke of luck that the Joss Whedon and the makers of Firefly and Serenity were given an oppotunity to go all out long before the characters began to fall into repetition and ennui.Firefly started out with a bang and pretty much needed to end that way. In the pilot episode, many characters get hurt and almost die, but then survive, giving off a strong impression that they were never really going to be let go throughout the rest of the series... a feeling that the rest of the season one didn't really argue against. Now that Whedon was faced without prospects for carrying the characters through an even larger exploration of the worlds created, the movie gave him an opportunity to take what had been built (fun characters that the audience both loves and can get behind, a galactic political structure worth fighting for or against depending on what you're willing to sacrifice, and a universe of beasties, to name a few aspects) and absolve them of the fact that they weren't really meant to change much at all, instead letting them go all out.The result is an action adventure space Western that is both fun and willing, creating a decent two hours to attract the fans and allowing itself enough space to make it worth it for newcomers. Despite a few naysayers who state that the film never really rises above its television-style roots, the camera is finally allowed to stretch its legs and ultimately the story is much more versatile and engaging than the series ever was, even despite Fox's mismanagement of its release.Of course, there's a few people who might be bothered by the deaths of certain characters. But I think it's a token of just how much more adventurous and imaginative the film is that it allows the fact that these characters have more than dark pasts to worry about... they're still in a universe of danger.Whether there will be subsequent works in this series or franchise is unknown to me, but I'm satisfied.--PolarisDiB",Serenity
48,dfranzen70,Not quite good as the series,6,31 March 2006,"If you were a die-hard fan of the cult-favorite TV series Firefly, then Serenity will surely satisfy you. If not, then you're probably better off skipping it entirely. The heavyhanded writing and direction by Joss Whedon, coupled with the hamfisted, cardboard acting of Nathan Fillion, reduce this big-screen offering to just another mishmashy sound-and-fury action movie.The setting is 500 years in the future. Owing to overpopulation, denizens of Earth have emigrated to other worlds, known as the Core planets, where life is pretty darn good, and trade and communication betwixt the planets is booming. Mal Reynolds (Fillion) and the crew of his Firefly-class spaceship Serenity travel the heavens, taking on jobs that usually skirt the edge of legality, and sometimes dive headfirst over said edge into a pool of sin.Mal's crew includes his second in command; Zoe (Gina Torres); pilot Wash (Alan Tudyk); muscular hothead Jayne (Adam Baldwin); mechanic Kaylee (Jewel Staite); and three passengers-turned-crew - Simon, the doctor (Sean Maher), Simon's sister River (Summer Glau), and Inara (Morena Baccarin), a Companion (otherwise known as a high-class call girl). Over the course of fifteen episodes, the crew becomes used to one another, just as devotees of the series will have grown accustomed to their faces. This is key; the more you know a character in a TV series, the more forgiving you'll be if the subsequent movie doesn't explain everything sufficiently, because you'll have the requisite background information already.Simon and River are fugitives; Simon busted his sister out of a government facility, where faceless drones picked apart and brain and drove her quite crazy. Trouble is, no one knows what she's capable of, and throughout the series she's shown flashes of skills beyond that which a typical teenage girl should possess. In the movie, River's instability is making things tough on the crew; because the government is looking for her and Simon, Mal must turn down jobs in order to fly below everyone's radar. So times are tough, and tensions are running high.When River - apparently directed subliminally - engages in a mêlée against a fewscore men (and wins) and Simon subdues her with a safe word, the pressure for Serenity to hand over the fugitives increases dramatically. Just before succumbing to the safe word, River utters her own mysterious word - ""Miranda."" Who or what is Miranda? Warning: Don't read further if you're a big Firefly fan. You're not going to like it...Serenity felt to me like an amateur-hour show. Yes, the effects are pretty cool, although nothing spectacular. But the writing's subpar. Whedon seems to have a pretty good sense of plot movement - no time for exposition or reflection needed - but he's not so adept in characterizations. I got the distinct feeling that the actors, for the most part, rose above their stilted dialog to turn in fine, appealing performances. Particularly effective was Baldwin as the scoundrel Jayne; he does get some of the funniest lines, but more importantly he knows how to deliver a comedic performance. Appropriately adorable is Staite as Kaylee (dig those everlit eyes), and flawlessly elegant is Baccarin as Inara.But the one character on whom the entire show and movie rest is also the one that's the most confounding - Malcolm Reynolds. Ethical vagueness is a very good descriptor for your characters to have; why announce his or her intentions every step of the way? But this can be problematic when the character is constantly changing attitudes and approaches, and those changes don't make a heck of a lot of sense.For example, there have been numerous times in which Mal has performed some sort of loyal act for his crew, even the fugitives. That's honorable. But then there have also been numerous times in which he's laid down the law, tyrant style, to that same crew. I don't mean with a simple my-way-or-the-highway approach, because that's certainly not unacceptable from the captain of the ship. I mean in a cruel, hateful manner. Here's what it boils down to for me - you can be a lovable Han Solo rogue, or you can be a mean despot, but it's really tough for any actor to play a character who's both. A good actor, perhaps, could pull this off, and Fillion is not a good actor. He has very little range; when he's joking, he wears this weird half-smile, not quite as developed as a sly grin, and when he's upset, his voice gets thick as week-old jelly. And that's about it.But back to the movie itself. I liked the plot, although certainly the fact that the show was over by the time filming begun played a huge role. The problem with this kind of approach is that a movie can feel as if plot devices were thrown in just for the sake of throwing everything into the mix. To clarify that statement would be folly; I'd risk spoiling some fun for you who haven't watched the movie yet. What I'm saying is that although there are plenty of surprises, since the movie is based on a well-known TV series, you get this sense of nothing really mattering - it's not as if there'll be a Season 2 with the consequences of those surprises apparent.I think Serenity (which, sorry, sounds more like adult diapers than a ship name) looks merely like a TV movie writ large; it's not as exciting or intriguing as the show was, for all its foibles, and I think that although blinded-by-the-Whedon acolytes will no doubt think it's the bee's knees, the rest of us can do better.",Serenity
49,JoeB131,A great movie,10,20 July 2008,"My only disappointment is that what we DESERVED was several full seasons of this fantastic show, rather than this well-intentioned movie that tied up the story lines raised during the too-few episodes we did get.Give the creators kudos for getting the entire cast back, and developing all of their characters. Also for taking chances, such as killing off two major characters to underscore the seriousness of the story. I was sad to see them go, but I realize the importance of their sacrifice.I also liked the ending. I contrast it with too many Star Trek films, where Kirk or Picard would conclude that kind of battle by kicking the antagonist to his demise. Not Malcolm Reynolds. He actually lets his enemy live (despite the death of several allies) and demonstrates the error of his way.My sadness is that we won't get anymore Firefly/Serenity after this. It was an excellent coda for the series, which left me wanting more. (As opposed to Star Trek, which wore out its welcome two series longer than it should have run.)",Serenity
50,Chris_Docker,Firefly  the Universal version,8,22 August 2005,"From a humble TV series (Firefly) by the man who made Buffy comes a full-blown galactic space adventure. The TV series was cancelled before completion, whereas the movie successfully erupts amid a fanfare of glory.Serenity secures an emotional investment from audiences in the first few minutes. The child psychic, River Tam is already questioning the conditioning, which the ruling alliance of planets imposes. Her talents are spotted and she is probed in a laboratory for military use. Her brother frees her, and she ends up on a rogue scavenger ship called Serenity whose crew, having lost the galactic war with the Alliance, try to eke out a living with shady deals.Even before opening credits conclude, we know and like the Captain, the lovely bad guy, the rebel without a cause. The woman we've seen since she was a victimised child has a temporary haven and our hearts; but she's such a big liability it's in everyone's interests to kill her. Futuristic settings look convincing, dialogue is sharp and gritty, and acting is played for adults. There's no shortage of excellent special effects and superb characterisation. Writer-director Joss Whedon's method of dry humour keeps it crackling  mostly by stating the obvious line and then turning it on its head. One fist-happy member of the crew remarks, ""I'll kill a man in a fair fight,"" then adds, "" . . . or if I think he's gonna start a fair fight."" When a scene could look excessively reminiscent of a Star Wars light-sabres duel, the Captain pulls out the only weapon he has  a tiny knife  to do battle with an enormous sword. Sexual innuendos are fair game  one female crew member complains it's ages since she's had anything between her legs that didn't need batteries. For monsters, the Serenity crew face the horror of the Reavers, cannibalistic half-humans that attack with incredible frenzy.Having been knifed by Fox for making a superb TV series, Joss Whedon and the cast deserve a round of applause for getting Serenity made at all. Artistic freedom in America doesn't come cheap, and the original series was far too hedonistic for a family values USA. Fans bought up the DVDs in such numbers that studios couldn't afford to ignore the dollar signs. Whedon is a brilliant writer and his cast have done the characters justice. Serenity is a great sci-fi action film that is well worth seeing.Shortcomings? Firefly was a very ambitious project and is hard to live up to. It was low on special effects but high on emotional drama and moral challenges that kept you thinking. It wasn't just the 'sci-fi' angle that pulled people in. With Zoe and Wash, the 'couple' on the ship, she outranks him and is also much smarter, posing a challenge to his macho image. Inara (Morena Baccarin) is the most controversial character of all: she is a 'companion'  a highly trained, highly qualified escort, commanding respect and attention almost like ancient geishas. She is the 'VIP' onboard and gets the captain and crew into places they would not be admitted and out of scrapes for which they lacked the finesse. In Serenity, Zoe and Wash just call each other 'Honey' all the time (any ranking is minimised) and Inara's role is completely dumbed down  sadly I thought, as it was mostly the dilemma of her character that got me hooked. A passing remark is made but her job is never explained - if you haven't seen the series you probably wouldn't know she was a 'lady of the night'. There is no attempt to challenge deep seated beliefs and stereotypes in the way that Firefly did (and probably killed by Fox, who preferred action over psychological drama). But are Universal the good guys? They're a studio, and they need to make money if they're investing wads of it, so a film that will upset the 'moral right' of the USA is needlessly cutting profits in half.I challenged Joss Whedon at the premiere about maintaining the artistic integrity and vision of the original over the next three years, but he replied that everybody had taken pay cuts just to get it made. I don't doubt their dedication too much, but I don't want to see a formularised part three just because it's gotten out of their control or they've had to lower their sights. Unlike Fox, I could manage with one or two less spaceships and big action sequences (if anything needs to be cut from the budget) and more drama. I want someone (probably not Universal) to give Joss Whedon the money to make part two as in-your-face as Firefly was. I want a movie that prompts more questions than it provides answers. I want science fiction that stretches my brain, not just my eyeballs, that challenges convention and, most of all, makes use of the incredible talent that Whedon and his fabulous cast have between them. (If not, given what they can do, they should jump ship for more independent funders, the way Boyle or Tarantino or even Ridley Scott did when they started.)Firefly set the hearts and minds of fans alight with one of the best science fiction stories ever made, a story that asked questions without giving simple answers, a bold excursion that breathed life into well-worn starwars tales, adult drama that wasn't afraid to upset people. Serenity has more action, more battles, more spaceships, but manages not to ruffle the waters of universal conservatism. Ironically, given the ultimate plot, one wonders if the civilising influence has not been overdone. It's such an enjoyable and well-made movie that it's nitpicky to say this, but in the welter of enthusiasm it could get lost. Keep fingers crossed and fanmail pressure up, to ensure a trilogy not only sees the light, but lets the light of inspiration shine stronger than studio doctrine.",Serenity
51,estebangonzalez10,Whedon's first feature film,6,29 July 2013,"""I'm going to grant your greatest wish. I'm gonna show you a world without sin.""Serenity was Joss Whedon's first feature film after experiencing a series of success as a writer and a TV director. Whedon's recent success with The Avengers made me want to go back and watch his earlier work which has a pretty solid fanbase. It has become somewhat of a cult film and it is an adaptation of Whedon's TV series Firefly which was only aired for one season despite having a decent amount of followers. The events in Serenity take place six months after the last episode of Firefly and shares the same cast as well. I never watched an episode of Firefly but had no trouble understanding the plot of this sci-fi film, but I would guess fans of the series will take greater pleasure in this movie. It is pretty easy to follow and despite a very slow beginning the film does pick up and has a very climatic ending. I thought the film was OK, the characters were pretty funny, but I didn't really find anything that stood out in order for me to consider this a classic. It was a decent sci-fi film, but I didn't find anything special about it beside the great sense of humor it has about itself. The characters are pretty strong and well developed, but the effects are pretty weak. I enjoyed this film, but it didn't blow my mind. Whedon also does a pretty decent job with the narrative of the film and wrote a solid and imaginative screenplay.Serenity takes place in the future, in the 26th century, after humans had to abandon Earth due to overpopulation and they discovered new galaxies where they were able to establish themselves. After a civil war between the Alliance and the rebels known as Independents, the Alliance came out victorious and colonized the entire galaxy. The surviving rebels continue to drift across the galaxy, and among them is the crew of Serenity. Their captain is Mal (Nathan Fillon) who fought for the rebels during the civil war. His first mate who also fought with him in the war is Zoe (Gena Torres), who happens to be married to the pilot, Wash (Alan Tudyk). Among the rest of the crew there is the mechanic, Kaylee (Jewel Staite) and the gunman, Jayne (Adam Baldwin). The crew wonder the galaxy trying to survive by doing jobs (including some illegal and criminal activities) or taking along passengers. One of the recent passengers they pick up are Simon (Sean Maher) and his sister River (Summer Glau). They soon find out that River has special psychic abilities and that she is being hunted down by the Alliance and one of their trackers (Chiwetel Ejiofor) thus putting in jeopardy the entire crew, and so the action begins.Nathan Fillion is a pretty strong lead and he gives a very charismatic performance. He is better known now as the lead in the TV series, Castle, but fans of Firefly and Serenity will forever remember him as the tough captain with a clever mouth. The rest of the cast is pretty strong thanks in most part to the inventive screenplay by Whedon. He is a great screenwriter and is known for creating some interesting narratives and memorable characters. The action in the second half of the film is pretty strong as well but it really took a long time to get going. Summer Glau has some pretty interesting action sequences, but the highlight of the film is the face off between the tracker and Mal. This sci-fi film mixes some western elements to it as well. Despite all this Serenity wasn't quite the classic I was expecting, but I still had a good time. Whedon's The Avengers is a much stronger film and you can tell how much he has matured as a director.",Serenity
52,Fluke_Skywalker,"'Serenity' flies, but never quite soars",7,13 November 2014,"Though I only ever watched the pilot episode of Joss Whedon's short-lived sci-fi series 'Firefly', I was certainly aware of its growing cult status over the years. So when it was announced that there would be a feature film, I wasn't surprised, and fully expected it to be a hit that spawned numerous sequels. It wasn't and it didn't, and fans were left with only half a season and this one movie.I still haven't watched the series, but this was my second time watching 'Serenity'. Originally inspired to do so by my admiration of Whedon's work on 'The Avengers', I revisited it this time to see if my initial pleasant surprise held up. It did.Despite some superficial similarities, 'Serenity' doesn't share either the humanistic optimism of 'Star Trek', nor the spirituality and do-goodery of 'Star Wars'. It's very much a Western in space. At times this notion is pushed a bit far, particularly with the cowpoke dialog, but that Libertarian-tinged rugged individualism is at the very heart of the movie. I give Whedon credit for respecting his audience enough not to beat them over the head with it, but it's there if you want to see it.The cast all seem quite comfortable in their roles, and there's a very understated chemistry between them that works well. They are archetypes, but never caricatures, and I give the bulk of the credit for that to them. The story here manages to hold the hand of the uninitiated until we're up to speed, and it wasn't long before I felt like I knew these people and at least got the gist of the universe they lived in.Though 'Serenity' is intelligent and very well made, it never does quite hit the emotional high points that it seems to be aiming for. Still, when it was over I was more than satisfied and found my self wishing that there were more adventures in store.",Serenity
53,mattkratz,good adaptation,9,20 January 2018,"This movie relies a lot on visual effects and picks up where the cancelled series Firefly left off. It also has a decent story as the cast wards off a threat. If you're into science fiction and enjoyed the show, this is a must for you. It would help if you're a fan of the show and are familiar with the cast. The ending was a little tragic though. I enjoyed the action scenes, the great moments among the cast members, and how this might remind you a bit of other great science fiction shows like Star Trek and Babylon 5. The cast really works well together, as it did in the show. You will love this movie! *** out of ****",Serenity
54,jimbo-53-186511,Far too cerebral and heavy-going without being much fun either,4,7 May 2016,"When one of their crew members is discovered missing, an assassin who is a member of The Alliance does everything in his power to make sure that this crew member is recovered. Those on board the ship known as Serenity are doing everything in their power to stop the assassin from recapturing her, but it turns out that she may be more dangerous than they anticipated.I came into watching Serentiy with no prior knowledge of the film - it's only after I watched it that I realised it was based on a TV Series known as Firefly. Clearly I have no real knowledge of the TV Series but will throw down a few thoughts on my viewing experience of this film....Well as you'll gather from my summary I didn't find Serenity to be a particularly enjoyable viewing experience and I suppose part of that may be down to what I expected from it. I was hoping that the film would offer a gritty battle between good and evil, a nifty bit of cat and mouse action and some humour to make it more digestible. Sadly these vital elements are pretty much absent for most of the running time and do mean that the film lacks any sort of urgency or excitement and as mentioned some dry humour now and again wouldn't have hurt.Although she's clearly important to the story I felt that River's character was shockingly underdeveloped - we learn very little about what happened to her whilst she was with The Alliance and how she acquired her 'gift'. This may or may not have been elaborated on in the TV Series, but either way considering how important she was to the story I felt that more could have been done with her character.Again considering this is supposed to be a film that is a battle between good and evil would it have hurt for us to have seen evidence of this more often?? Although this aspect of the story gets some focus towards the end, it isn't focused on often enough throughout the rest of the film meaning that it rarely feels exciting or intense. I think part of the problem with the middle section of the film is that it essentially focuses on River's journey and the crew of Serenity discovering the 'truth' about what the Alliance have done. With better character and plot development this certainly could have made this section of the film interesting and would have complimented the 'good versus evil' battle nicely, but this aspect of the story isn't handled well and again learning next to nothing about River clearly does more damage than good to the story. The simple truth of the matter is that when I watch a Science Fiction film I expect it to be fun and in all honestly that's something that's absent from this film and that's the main reason why it didn't work for me.",Serenity
55,sauravjoshi85,Disappointing and a major let down,6,24 February 2021,"Setenity is an action movie directed by Joss Whedon and stars Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Summer Glau, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin, Sean Maher and Jewel Staite.Before watching this movie I read some very good reviews of the movie and was excited to watch the movie and was expecting a funfilled joyride but was disappointed, either I am not able to understand the movie or the movie could be another case of overrated movie.The plot of the movie is predictable (please note that I haven't seen the original series) and the execution is slow. The screenplay also gets slow and boring. Cinematography of the movie is good but could've been more creative in creating the space and other planets.Although being an action movie but action are just average, the fight scene between Ejiofer and Fillion looks funny and unimpressive. The climax is just average.Acting is also disappointing as most of the characters had either over performed or under performed. Summer Glau was majorly irritating and Ejiofer was underutilised.Frankly speaking I am still not able to understand such high reviews for this movie, for me it's just one time watch movie.",Serenity
56,cjonesas,[8.2] The star of the movie is Summer Glau,8,16 August 2020,"A nice closure to a ""nostalgic"" series.It had the feeling of a mix of Indiana Jones-The Matrix in space, in a good way, with very good filming, VFX and a more serious and on point music.Each Firefly crew shone and delivered with humor, but to me, the star was undoubtedly Summer Glau with her multi-personality performance, better than in the series IMO.Lovers of Sci-Fi space movies adore Serenity, while others surely appreciate the hard work of Joss Whedon.",Serenity
57,noralee,"Most Fun, Straight Ahead Intelligent Sci Fi Movie of the Year",9,3 October 2005,"Yes I looked forward to ""Serenity"" as a fan of writer/director Joss Whedon from TV's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" through the ""Firefly"" series that inspired this film, but anyone who likes rollicking, intelligent sci fi movies will also love that it is the most fun, straight ahead sci fi movie of the year. Whedon plunges us into the post-TV series plot much as ""Star Wars"" initially plunged us into an ongoing story. So newcomers won't know that the information revealed in the opening segment was still being built up to in the TV series, as fans and newbies get all caught up quickly with a minimum of explication. The essential back stories on each character are quickly established with nifty visuals and various tense and romantic relationships can be easily inferred without knowing how they got that way, even as they progress, some in surprising ways, through the snappy, bantering camaraderie that is Whedon's hallmark. Unlike most films these days the trailers don't use up all the good lines, partly because some of them are only funny in the specific context.The movie doesn't invent much new in the genre, but George Lucas didn't either. Yes Nathan Fillion's ""Mal Reynolds"" is a lot like ""Han Solo"" as a captain of a rag tag ship, but he's more than a smuggler with his memory-haunted back story as a veteran from a losing side and moral code. The blow hard elements of ""Solo"" are given almost satirically to Adam Baldwin's tough guy ""Jayne"" (which always seemed to be a bit of ""A Man Named Sue"" kind of joke.) Religion is a component, but not a force, as the Christian ""Shepherd"" has a small, advisory role here. Though this far future is familiar from other imagined futures, with a post-war, victorious alliance, the particular political situation the characters are caught in has a specific pay off that is both smart and emotional, emphasized by the numbers who are sacrificed for its suppression.But Whedon's strength is always his unusual female characters for sci fi, particularly his trademark teen girl as ""The Weapon"" with ""she's simply extraordinary"" powers (the series had been canceled before we found out about all her powers and her newly developed uneasy alliance with the crew is a creative element of the film); plus a sex-starved tomboy mechanic and Gina Torres as a magnificent soldier -- and the tough men who are intensely loyal to them, particularly a brother and a loving husband. One female character is somewhat mysterious here, and even misrepresented a bit as her importance is pared to her essentials, but she is ancillary to the plot here. Key is that you really care about these characters and what unexpectedly happens to them.Chiwetel Ejiofor, with his native Brit accent, makes a neat enemy as ""The Operative"" with more intriguing motivations than usual for an implacable foe as he is both cynical and ideological, though his samurai sword calling card is a bit overly dramatic.Though I wasn't able to stay for the credits to see what special effects techniques were used, it seemed that whooshing editing and shaking models effectively made up for a small CGI budget. The busy screen is filled at all times. There are background, imaginative touches throughout the production design, such as the dominant Asian alphabets.There are a few banjo sounds in David Newman's swooping score to remind of the original premise of the series as a space western, though the cowboy element isn't obvious here",Serenity
58,aharmas,In the not so very far future,9,16 October 2005,"Watching this film is like riding a roller-coaster. It's never dull, and when the action is on, which is most of the time, it's very good. Before going on, I have to say that I didn't give it a 10 because I am still confused about some of the plot. It shouldn't really matter, but every other aspect of the film is so well presented that I couldn't let that go.For starters, I was very pleased to see characters that are not sketches or just poor introduced ideas; instead these very interesting people are well fleshed-out, with flaws, and tremendous amounts of charm. They're not too original, but they're not badly botched attempts at being original or cute. The main hero is a man with a short fuse and plenty of determination, and yet he surprises us by having one or two deep thoughts. The siren has a brain. The psychic child actually is able to articulate what is going on, without having the special effects go haywire.It is an intense film, owing much to contemporary times (if we bother to look carefully at some of its nuances). This one is a movie that begs for a sequel. We keep hoping they keep as interesting and lively as this one. Very good job.",Serenity
59,Enchorde,I did find serenity...,9,7 November 2006,"Recap: Malcolm and crew suddenly finds themselves in a much more dangerous position than they ever have before. The Alliance has sent a most lethal and unscrupulous agent to find and terminate River Tam, seen as a great threat. After a bar brawl where River single-handedly neutralizes everyone else, the crew find themselves wondering if she is a threat to them as well. Still, they run and hide, as the net from the Alliance tightens. Finally, they're desperate enough to gamble everything, ship and lives, to reveal why River is a threat to the Alliance.Comments: I know a movie should be viewed and judged separately, and in its own light. But it is impossible not to consider and compare Serenity with the series Firefly. Though this movie is very good, it does not really reach the heights of Firefly, and that is not very surprising. In a series, you have lot of time to develop characters, reveal mysteries and evolve the series and story. In a movie, where time is very much limited, this depth and development is not possible. In addition every scene in Serenity must deliver something spectacular, a demand that doesn't exist in the series in the same sense.Though, much of the air and feel of the series are conserved and brought back in the movie. And the series are stellar, so this is great. A Western/Sci-Fi/Comedy combination that has no comparison (besides the series).The movie loses a little quality as it focuses much more on River as the threat and Malcolm as the captain. Other characters have been made to take one step back - and the quantity of characters and personalities is one of the strengths of the series. As said, the movie loses a bit of this. Still, all characters are there, in one way or another, and the cast has preserved the special bonds and air between them. Much of the dialog is delivered with a lot of sense of humour, in perfect tune to the movie.No expenses seem to have been spared on the effects, so I have no complaints there. In fact, they are very good, and should serve as a model for other filmmakers. A good portion of action makes sure that you get a lot of chances to study them as well.It is possible to view the movie without having seen the series, as the makers has made sure to include background enough to build a base for the movie. But I would surely recommend seeing the series first as you have much more knowledge about all and everyone. And have you seen the series and liked it, I would be surprised if you saw the movie and found it disappointing. I found it great, almost perfect for my taste. Afterwards I was able to find the serenity I have searched for since I saw the final episode... Hopefully there will be more sequels! 9/10",Serenity
60,questl-18592,Firefly: The Movie,9,11 September 2021,"Serenity falls into that category of movies really only meant for fans. If you in the past or present haven't been a fan of the series Firefly, this will likely be entirely wasted on you. Which is a shame because the characters are wonderfully rich and complex. The humor is on point, they actually had a budget this time around so could work some special effects.It's still far from a perfect movie. In order to tie up as much as they could they had to make some story alterations from the show that don't really make sense. Some drastic character alterations to characters and there are still plenty of hanging threads but it's such a glorious finale to this universe that it's hard to be angry at it.",Serenity
61,Seraphion,Solid enough,7,17 October 2015,"The story shows how Joss Whedon is a great writer/director for anything adventurous, or anything that spurs your imagination right on. It's presented nicely and comes in very solid. All the plots are displayed beautifully; some are shown as twists, while some are seeping in even from early on. What's good is that the movie didn't bother to use much of any uncommon jargon or technical terms, instead focusing more on the adventure side of the story. It also introduces a slight dose of mystery and horror's jump-scares without having to stretch itself too far off. The end parts sure tastes like a genuine sci-fi action ending. What this movie lacks is the part where the CGI fills in. Those CGI additions and replacements seemed very much like this movie is a work of a great indie house, and not of a big production house like Universal. The CGI looks botched in many places, and there are even more spots when it would have been better if the movie puts CGI on them. The action overall feels nice. Nathan FIllion, Gina Torres and Summer Glau did well in their characters. Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin added nicely to the ensemble.",Serenity
62,Matt_Layden,"""Exactly What The Star Wars Prequels Should Have Been.""",9,9 January 2006,"The crew of Serenity are on the run with a passenger that, unknown to them, is a deadly-weapon and has a deadly secret. An assassin in pursuit of them, believing what he is doing is right. This leads the crew of Serenity on a dangerous adventure, trying to tell the world of the secret and the military that will stop at nothing to hide it.Joss Whedon is a cult phenomenon behind such hits like, my personal favourite, Buffy The Vampire Slayer and it's spin-off counterpart Angel. Here he takes his imagination to space with the western/sci-fi themed Firefly. After it's abrupt cancellation Whedon fought to get the story complete, hence Serenity.Serenity is a wild ride from start to finish. It has everything that you could ask for in a film. The special effects are great, the cast works extremely well together and the story is entertaining and actually quite good. Serenity is exactly what the Star Wars prequels should have been, a great entertaining sci/fi adventure.Nathan Fillion has his first major role with Serenity and hopefully big movie executives will take notice. Fallion is able to not only act strong, but lead a strong cast that work well together. Granted, the same actors worked on the small screen, seeing a cast that actually clicks together and play their characters so well off one another is fun. Chiwetel Ejiofor is decent as the assassin, who showcases no emotion because he is in fact just following orders, until he sees the horrors of what he is protecting.The special effects, although not as jaw dropping as Star Wars, is able to still give you a wow factor. Seeing the ships chasing Serenity through the clouds and the military not ready for it was amazing and leads into a huge battle, that is on par with any of the Star Wars prequels space battles, if not better. Serenity uses originality in it's battle rather then fly and shoot, which we've seen a little too many times.The story is not so complex, girl has powers. Learns of a dark secret from the government and escapes. Government sends assassin to catch and kill her. What makes the plot of the story more interesting then what it sounds, the way Whedon constructs it all. Subliminal messages in TV commercials playing on all the planets trigger the girl's mind and turns her into a killing machine. Of course a young girl taking out huge guys left right and centre will attract some attention.While there are enough inside jokes for fans of the firefly series, Serenity is a movie that anyone can enjoy. You do not need to know any back story to any of the characters or even heard of firefly to enjoy or understand Serenity. Whedon applies witty dialogue to the characters to make you laugh when needed and emotional situations to make you cry. Not in a while has there been a movie that is sharp, funny, sad, and entertaining all in one in a long time. There is enough action for the action buffs, enough comedy for people who like to laugh and enough sci/fi for space nuts. There is not a dull moment in the film, when the action is gone the dialogue keeps us on track with the film.Any fan of the TV series will be more then satisfied. Any sci/fi fan will be more then pleased. Any movie goer will have a fun time. Serenity was too good for the average movie goer. I sometimes wonder what kind of place we live in when a great film such as Serenity goes unnoticed in the world and some of the crappiest films you can ever imagine go on to make the big bucks. Whedon has closed the Serenity chapter in his life and will go on to make other projects, but for now, Serenity is where the entertainment is at.",Serenity
63,pc95,"Good Sci-Fi, but could've been Great",7,18 July 2013,"Saw the high average IMDb rating for Joss Wheden's ""Serenity"", so decided to give it a viewing, and to my delight I was not disappointed. It's strengths which is it's great story-line and related nice pacing. Also there was good cinematography, and some good performances The story grabs you quickly and manages to improve as it moves along brisk-fully. Without giving too much away it is well thought out Sci-Fi. However the main drawbacks for me was the dialog which was very poor during the first quarter of the movie. Bad lines are followed with bad line-delivery, and some of the early group scene dialogs on space-ship Serenity were horribly wooden in delivery (think TV show cheesy) - this is mostly on the director and editors. However if you stick with it, the movie and dialog sharpens. The production values are pretty cheesy, and maybe expected for this ambitious of a story. I think a much larger budget and enhancements to the dialog/script, and perhaps another director would've made this a top movie. Chewetal Ejiofor was marvelous. I'd seen him earlier in the later movie ""Salt"" with Anjelina Jolie where he clearly was the best actor and salvaging that movie. In Serenity he anchors the movie, giving much needed weight and quality. Lead Nathan Fillion holds his own especially considering the early tripe he has to work with. I would recommend ""Serenity"" especially if you like Sci-Fi. It was good, but could've been great. 7/10",Serenity
64,lewiskendell,"So good, that it leaves you desperate for more.",9,27 April 2010,"I'm about to do a lot of rambling, because I love anything related to Firefly. If you'd rather not read all that, the most important part is that you absolutely must see this movie. It's funny, smart and thrilling, and you don't have to know the slightest thing about the Firefly universe to love it. I didn't, the first time I saw it. Serenity features some of the most well- written characters ever seen in sci-fi, or elsewhere, the best space battles since the original Star Wars trilogy, humor, emotion (especially for people who have seen the original series), and epic action scenes out the wazoo. Watch it. Watch it now.  Firefly stands with Lost, the Battlestar Galactica reboot, Terminator: TSCC and Alias as the best sci-fi flavored drama TV shows in American history. This is not an opinion, it's a fact. Alas, it was canceled as many excellent shows that don't pander to the lowest common denominator often are, and the most promising new fictional universe in a while, was brought to an end without any firm sense of closure for its fans. A fanatical fan-base kept supporting the show through DVD sales and across the internet, and eventually rumors of a movie began to look more and more concrete. Thank Gid for that. Not only is Serenity a fantastic entry into the series canon, it's also a perfect segue to bring newcomers into the series. That's exactly what it did for me. I saw the movie, then immediately had to get the show on DVD. Five years later I still regularly pop in the movie and the TV episodes, because they're just that good.    Every episode of Firefly was like a self-contained movie, and you didn't need much knowledge of the show overall to really enjoy it. Serenity is the same way. Even if you've never seen a single episode of the series, you should watch this movie. It's a fantastic fusion of action, sci-fi, and even westerns. I can't imagine who would be disappointed by this. I'm far from a Joss Whedon super-fan (I loved his run on Astonishing X-Men and the excellent episode of The Office he directed, but I couldn't care less about Buffy or Dollhouse), but this movie is amazing in nearly every way. From the settings, to the choreography, to the brilliant cast and story, it's a gem.",Serenity
65,brando647,A Perfect End for the Series,8,18 September 2012,"When I fell in with Joss Whedon's ""Firefly"" series, I sort of did it backwards. I saw SERENITY a few years before I ever got around to watching the actual television series so, I'll be honest, I was a bit lost the first time around. Once I sat down and watched the series, then revisited the movie, it all came together, but it went to prove that you probably want a bit of context before going into SERENITY. It's not hard to follow the basics but, if you truly want to get the most from this movie, you'll want to be familiar with the show first. SERENITY is a great movie and the best possible closure we could've gotten for the series. It's a horrible shame that ""Firefly"" never got a real chance to thrive on TV, but Whedon gave the fans a great send- off with this movie. The movie focuses on the largest underlying plot thread from the series and the one fans would most want to see resolved: River Tam. The Alliance becomes desperate to recover River when it is believed she may have dangerous Alliance secrets buried within her broken mind. An Operative, a cold-blooded killer with a strong sense of ethics, is dispatched to find her and bring her back, but he will competing with Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his crew of their Firefly-class transport, Serenity. Captain Reynolds isn't one to give up on a member of his crew (no matter what trouble they've brought) and he's willing to risk it all in protecting her and bringing these 'verse-shaking secrets to light.Fans of the show are guaranteed to love this movie. It remains perfectly true to the series and characters and does it's best to give some sense of closure since we'll never get further episodes to detail the exploits of Mal and the Serenity's crew. For those unfamiliar with the series, ""Firefly"" wasn't your typical science fiction. It's not all clean and beautiful like the STAR TREK series, and it never gets as fantasical as STAR WARS. It's more down and dirty. It's an awesome blend of science fiction and western, and the combo makes it a hundred times more appealing for me to watch. Captain Reynolds and his crew a band of scavengers/smugglers just trying to eke out a living in their dire circumstances. Once he brought River and her brother Simon on board his ship, they became a part of his crew and this movie expands on the series by showing just what extreme lengths he will go to when the Alliance comes sniffing around for them. Fans of the show can also dig the fact that Whedon uses his final journey with Serenity to delve into the past of the Reavers, a barbarian breed of men who have supposedly been to the end of the galaxy and seen the vast emptiness and proceeded to lose their minds. I'm sure all of this would have been handled with in greater detail if the show had made it past one season, but Whedon does a great job of giving the fans what they want in the two hour running time.The entire cast from the show returns for the movie, so everyone's favorite crew member gets a chance to shine. Nathan Fillion continues to prove that he's leading man material as Captain Reynolds and raise the question: why hasn't his career taken off more yet? As if the show wasn't proof enough of his charm and charisma. As Whedon has proved a natural talent when working with ensemble casts, there is a perfect balance and no character is left neglected, but be warned that no one is safe at this point. This is Serenity's final mission and, as such, the risk is higher. Chiwetel Ejiofor is the Operative tasked with hunting down River Tam and bring her back to the Alliance and he makes for an intriguing villain; he's as deadly as he is civilized, following his own code of ethics without regard for the big picture. He is told to bring River back, and he will bring her back. There is only his job. He is vastly intelligent and he will give Mal and his crew a good run in his efforts to complete his mission. There is enough here to please fans and non-fans alike. SERENITY is a great adventure film that captures the spirit of the show and gives newcomers a taste of what could have been if ""Firefly"" had been given a fair chance.",Serenity

Then came Serenity. It's one of my favorite movies. The cast really puts it together, the story is great. The enemy, the nameless agent is one of the best semi-villains ever on cinema. I regret the deaths in it and still wish for a sequel, but this movie hits it out of the park. Fruity-Oaty bars, Jayne wishing he HAD SOME GRENADES, River kicking ass in the bar (look for a hand weapon from Babylon 5), the entire finale battle AND Joss's wink at the fans, C-57-D (the cruiser from forbidden planets registration number) shows up quite often.

The 13 episodes prior to that final episode ran from predictable to mundane and when it was cancelled, I couldn't have cared less. Serenity however, is one of the best science fiction movies of the last 20 years. Not a wasted scene, bad performance or a slow bit in the entire movie. Between cable where it now plays constantly and my Blu Ray (I passed the DVD onto a friend) I've watched it over 50 times and never been bored.

Not only have the characters, setting and storyline become beloved by a wide cult audience of millions, but the behind-the-scenes drama the show experienced with Fox due to its pre-mature cancellation have become ingrained into our culture, and ""Firefly"" is inevitably always mentioned as a series that was tragically canceled before its time.However, those same cult fans who continued to adore and love the show also managed to do the seemingly impossible- their love and dedication managed to resurrect the series in the form of ""Serenity""- this motion- picture adaptation which serves as a sort of sequel and follow up to the series, which manages to resolve the major leftover plot lines.And ""Serenity"" is a near flawless follow-up, supplying fans with the same high-quality writing, characterization and fun that they so desperately missed.Written and directed by ""Firefly"" creator Joss Whedon, ""Serenity"" is as good a follow-up as possible.The film follows the motley crew of the spaceship ""Serenity"", as they are drawn into a deep conflict set forth by a ruthless government agent known only as the ""Operative"", who seeks to claim and possibly destroy River Tam, a crew-member who possesses deep-seeded power and is a potential security-threat for the main governing body of the future- The Alliance.It will eat up too much space in this review to go over each of the nine lead characters and their respective actors (although I was able to discuss them in my review for ""Firefly""), but suffice to say, everyone is at the top of their game. Particularly Nathan Fillion as our lead character Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds, the captain of the ship, and Summer Glau as River Tam, who is given a large focus in the story and is explored in exquisite detail. Every actor does an amazing job in this film, but Mal and River are the beating heart of the production.The production is top-class all around. Whedon's script is fast, funny, concise, well-paced and develops the universe of the show in new ways that will bring about some shocking revelations. His direction is fluid and a lot of fun, showing some true creativity with his choice of shots, composition and handling of the characters. The costume and set design is amazing. It takes the foundation of the series, but is able to build upon it thanks to a larger budget. And it makes the film feel all the more realistic and fascinating as a result. And the effects are first- rate, and hold up astonishingly well even now, eight years after the film's release.Another great strength of the film is that while it is technically a follow-up to ""Firefly"", Whedon is able to use his talents as a filmmaker to craft the film in such a way that it is surprisingly accessible. It may be a film for the fans first and foremost, but I can easily see a newbie to the franchise enjoying the film without first seeing the series. A lot of care is put into establishing the universe, and Whedon is able to organically catch the audience up through dialog and action, so this is definitely a film for everyone, fan or not.All of that praise being said, there are a few points of criticism that some fans have, and I do feel they are valid, and are what holds this back from getting a perfect 10 from me. It mainly comes down to two points.First, this film does feel like a sort-of abrupt ""digest version"" of a much larger storyline. The issue is that the series was canceled after only one season, and it can said without doubt that Joss Whedon had a much larger storyline planned that would have encompassed multiple seasons to resolve the conflicts. This brings about the issue that the film does feel a tad on the abrupt side, as multiple seasons worth of resolution had to be compacted down into a single 2-hour film. And it does make some of the revelations, though well-written and well thought- out, feel a bit on the contrived side.And the second issue is that this is a tonally and stylistically different beast than the series. While the series was very much a Western in space, and followed a lot of the stylings and philosophies of the Western genre, this film drops that for the most part. Whereas the show was a Sci-Fi Western, the film is Sci-Fi action. It can cause a slight period of re-adjustment for viewers familiar with the series, and I can see how it could negatively impact the film for some fans, although I had no issue with it whatsoever.That being said, these two issues cannot diminish in any way the rampant strengths of the film. This is still an incredible, entertaining, thought-out, complex film, and it's an absolute blast to watch. And that fun-factor is something that cannot be ignored... this is without a doubt one of the ""funnest"" films I've ever seen, and that does have a really big impact on it. While it isn't quite as flawless as the series that inspired it, it has all of the heart.I give Joss Whedon's ""Serenity"" a near-perfect 9 out of 10. See it. See ""Firefly."" Have a shiny day.",Serenity
70,denis888,"Not Perfect, But A Fairly Decent Sequel To The Series",8,9 January 2016,"Bot always the TV series can be painlessly transformed into a full- time cinema film, or movie, as one can say. Often, a specific pace of a longer serial can be rushed and thus perplexed. Some people complained that this is what exactly got down to Serenity as a sequel a cult-classic Firefly. Well, I can say that yes, some humor was lost and some warm Wild West-ish atmosphere was almost gone, too, but the whole cats is here, and yeah, the pace is frenetic and it sometimes dazzles and stupefies. Bit is the movie that bad? Nay, it is not. The cast cats did an admirable work there, and Nathan Fillion as Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds is marvelous, as well as Morena Baccarin as Inara Serra and all he rest. My personal IMHO is that Summer Glau is the weakest link in this albeit seamless chemistry, she seems to be a bit listless and a bit vapid, but still, that does not hurt as the movie grows well and builds the suspense extremely well. You can watch and enjoy this movie, it is still good",Serenity
71,mike48128,Right up there with Star Wars! How Did I Ever Miss This One?,8,11 April 2017,"This has been called everything from a ""Space Western"" to ""1984 in Space"". It borrows well from many concepts and is indeed better than a few of the grandiose overblown Star Trek Movies. A critical success that barely broke even at the box office. Outstanding in almost every category. Acting, script and dialog, EFX, costumes, sets, photography, you-name-it! Based on the 14 episode Fox Series ""Firefly"" using (some of) the same cast. Capt. ""Mal"" Reynolds and his ""rag-tag band of pirates and thieves"" fight and die hard (Yes, some die) and become involved in the plight of a 17-year-old girl, completely raised and programmed by the Alliance, in an effort to control her amazing psychic abilities. She can ""hear"" thoughts.""River Tam"" is saved by her brother, Dr. Simon Tam, and they end up as passengers and participants on an amazing space adventure. A bank robbery on a planet and a ""kick-Ass"" fight in an alien bar. Along the way we are given ""hints"" about River's other fighting talents. Untimately, it's all about a terrible secret that the Alliance wants to keep hidden. After ""terraforming"" an entire solar system, on the planet ""Miranda"", a special gas released into the atmosphere killed off most of the population and turned the rest of the inhabitants into flesh-eating monsters. A most unusual plot twist has the good captain almost fighting-to-the-death and then creating an uneasy truce with ""The Operative"". I enjoyed it and so did Roger Ebert, way back in 2005.",Serenity

Great movie. Would have been better as a TV series. But, I'm grateful to see at least some recompense paid to the fans. The additions to the cast were top notch. The CGI was good. The writing was superb. EPIC fight scene(s) with River.

73,DJAkin,I already saw this when it was called Star Wars!,4,8 October 2005,"This movie was OK. I guess you have to really be into Buffy the Vampyire Slayer and Firefly to really get into it. This guy who tries to be like Han Solo pilots a makeshift Millinium Falcon. He has a job of taking jobs to make money. I was half expecting him to deliver a spice load to Jabba the Hutt. Then there are the evil sandpeople who FLY called Reefers or something to THAT affect. There is the gentle black man who reminded me of Darth Vader. Also, there was a rebel alliance. I mean how much of a rip off can you get? This movie was more like a reminder of the images I see on the TV as I flip channels and see Farscape or Babylon 5 on the TV. I was not impressed with that River girl. Was she going for the Alanis Morsette look? Hello? Can you be any MORE obvious? She was a cross between that fighter chick from Riddick and Alanis Morsette with a little bit of brat thrown in for good measure. And what's with Ron Glass? I guess he needed work since nobody will hire him since the days of Detective Harris in ABC's long running hit series, Barney Miller. Get a life Ron Glass. Nobody likes you. Also, that pathetic excuse for a TOUGH guy played by Rick Linderman, the tall and strange guy in Cliff's class is the perfect candidate to be engaged as a body guard in the movie MY BODYGUARD.

74,sme_no_densetsu,Is this what passes for good sci-fi these days?,7,22 September 2008,"In case you're unaware, ""Serenity"" is a continuation of the TV series ""Firefly"" which was axed from Fox's schedule before the first season had even finished airing. Considering that, this film was most likely meant specifically for the many devoted fans of the series. The high IMDb rating suggests that Whedon hit the mark in that respect.Unfortunately, if you're coming into the film fresh then you may have the same lukewarm reaction that I did. A big part of the problem is that Joss Whedon doesn't seem to realize that ignorance of the backstory nullifies much of dramatic impact. When characters died and relationships were kindled I couldn't care less because Whedon didn't bother to convince me that I should care about these people. Presumably the necessary character development was done some time earlier in the TV series.Also, I can't quite define it but, to me, the characters have a distinct straight-from-TV feel. Perhaps that could have been remedied somewhat by having better acting talent on board. As it is, there are at least a couple of below average performances in my opinion while the vast majority are strictly average. Of course, Whedon's script doesn't exactly help matters as most of the quips fall flat and there's a smattering of cringe-worthy dialogue to boot.At least the CGI is fairly well done but as far as I'm concerned it's wasted on a mediocre story populated with uninteresting characters. Whedon's direction is good enough I suppose though I honestly can't recall even a single shot that was in any way memorable. Nor can I recall anything about the score, which suggests to me that both were strictly average and not worth remarking upon.Perhaps I've been a bit harsh but that's only to counteract the high IMDb rating which is almost certainly buoyed by die-hard ""Firefly"" fans. See this only if you're a certified ""Firefly"" fan or if you're a more general sci-fi fan prepared for a merely decent film.",Serenity

Now he must battle with the totalitarian state government who pursue him with a relentless passion with their number one guy, a priest like man....similar to the villain that Nathan Fillion played in Buffy, Caleb.The film isn't an eye opener like Star Wars, but it will have you laughing and cringing...mainly cringing in the fight scenes. The jokes are very subtle and I don't mean to criticise anyone but...you have to have a certain type of humour for this movie...Still a great movie with a great cast.

It wasn't a bad movie although I think it may have been more emotional as one reviewer said it was for them if I knew the backstories. I think seeing so many characters getting killed off put this into a weird genre different than what it should be. I have to say that having seen this that I do now want to see the first season or at least start it if for no other reason than to see if I'd like it.",Serenity
78,mstomaso,"Not brilliant, but entertaining and consistent with the series",7,1 October 2005,"I tried desperately to avoid getting my hopes elevated beyond reason, but it was to no avail. I have watched the entire Firefly series twice over the last two years, and had always hoped that it would somehow return. Firefly was one of the most recent examples of an intelligent, challenging, sci-fi show getting mismarketed and canceled by network TV. Firefly was a western adventure set in space with a compelling plot and bold, very likable characters. Serenity is its reprise in a full-feature film. Still, Serenity endeavors to introduce non-fans to its characters and major story arc in a very clever and subtle way, so that fans and non-fans alike can appreciate it completely. Those familiar with the saga of River and her alliance pursuers will enjoy the consistency with which the characters are portrayed and the development of her character into what she could have realized had the show been permitted to fully mature.Before I go much further, I should state that I am no Joss Whedon fan - as I have found most of his TV work trite and over-hyped. Firefly earned my respect for Joss within a few minutes of the first episode, and I now watch him in my peripheral vision - just in case he does something this original and clever again.Serenity is a Firefly class space transport ship operating illegally on the outskirts of Alliance civilization - the lawless edges of a solar system with many inhabited, terraformed, planets. Captain Malcolm Reynolds is stuck between reavers - cannibalistic semi-human sociopaths who prey on unsuspecting ships in this outer realm, and the alliance, from which he and his crew have been running for months.The focus of this movie is the resolution of a story arc first developed in Firefly - that of River Tamm and her brother, Serenity's ship doctor, though it focuses on the entire ensemble cast in much the same way the TV show did - allowing each to fully and complexly develop. I will give a bit of the back-story here though you don't need it to appreciate the film.Mal is an internally conflicted man with a strong sense of justice and a big warm heart which he shields with a frigid philosophy and an attempted stoicism. He and his first officer Zoey were part of a defeated rebellion against The Alliance (a federally organized empire of fascist urbanites reminiscent of the society of Gattaca). With the war lost, Zoey married to his pilot (Wash), a thug (Jayne), a young prodigy engineer with limited social graces (Kaylee), an aristocratic prostitute (Inara), and a few mysterious fugitives Shepherd Book, Simon, and River, he has set out to smuggle and thieve his way through the outer territories, disrupting and avoiding the alliance all along the way. The crew of Serenity have given up civilization as the cost of freedom.River and Simon had begun as passengers, but Simon's medical skills and the fact that the Alliance seemed to have an irreversible interest in either killing or kidnapping Simon's sister River gave Reynolds reason to become interested in them. After a while it became clear that River had been the subject of a variety of experiments involving violence and telepathy conducted by The Alliance. First appearing to be dangerously insane, River became more and more recognizable as a weapon.The characterizations in Serenity are very strong, and the cast is top-notch. Although I was never entirely thrilled with her in Firefly (though I always respected her talent), Summer Glau (River) really steals the show with her powerful, evocative performance. The script and story are excellent, though I felt the pace of the dialog could have been slowed a bit for the sake of dramatic quality. There is plenty of action in this film, though it does not fall into the trap that most recent sci-fi has of losing its plot, intelligence and characterizations in boring and absurd action sequences. The cinematography, though not as revolutionary as that used in Firefly, is excellent. My only disappointments - and they are mild at worst - are that I thought the plot could have been a little more complex, original and intelligent, giving the film the intense drama that some of the best episodes of the series had (such as Bushwhacked) and the fact that excellent original theme song for the show did not appear anywhere in the film.. The villain of the film was interesting and well developed, but I would have preferred a few minutes less action and a little more character development for him.Nevertheless, I recommend Serenity highly to sci fi fans - particularly those who want more of a human story than Star Trek has offered lately, and might be looking for something less soapy and intense and more fun than the excellent new BSG. it really does not matter if you have seen the series. This film stands on its own.",Serenity
79,vithiet,I'm a die hard Firefly fan so I'm completely biased,9,29 December 2018,"I am so happy they allowed them to make this movie to conclude the way too short-lived Firefly TV show. Do not watch this movie before watching the show; it's only 13 episodes. Also do yourself a favor and search online for the ""correct"" order to watch those episodes. Then watch Serenity and keep wondering (and crying) about how epic this show would have been if they could have developed the story over several seasons.",Serenity
80,film-critic,Half of writing history is hiding the truth.,8,19 January 2006,"As I glance through other reviews of this film, I see several people mention that they had not seen the television series prior to watching this film. While most still loved what Whedon had to offer in this big screen adaptation, I must warn everyone that you MUST watch the television series first. There are character connections and emotional moments that you may not develop an understanding about without watching the series first. Serenity is a conclusionary film in the sense that its purpose is to finally answer those questions that were left on the table at the end of the television series. With that said, Serenity is the BEST conclusionary film ever! The true conclusion to Whedon's science fiction epic is finally told with the budget it deserved. While I do believe that Whedon could have successfully done this perhaps seven seasons later, due to the final termination of the first season, he did the best that he could. Actually, who am I kidding, he did magnificently.I am an enormous, yet new, fan of this series. For those that have not experienced the television show Firefly, you are missing out on possibly the best that television had to offer. This film is just a brief snippet of what was offered in the television series. So much of this film is left up to the idea that the viewer has seen the television series, no matter what others may say. You need to watch the television series first. Whedon has amazingly transformed the bond between these characters, the tension, the excitement, the passion, and given them their feature debut. Everyone, from the small background characters to the head-honchos of this crew, give more than 100% in their efforts for Whedon's dream. It is obvious as you watch this conclusion that those involved with this series were extremely passionate about what Whedon was creating. The actors were completely immersed in their roles, giving us the same spunk, pizazz, and charm from the original series. Watching Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin, Jewel Staite, Sean Maher, and Summer Glau reprise their characters was like revisiting your favorite book on a beautiful spring day at the beach. Nothing could have been more enjoyable or relaxing.One of the aspects that I love about this film is that Whedon honestly does answer all of those burning questions that are in the back of your mind. Fans of the show will know what I am talking about. Those watching the series and wondering about River, Reavers, the Alliance, and a bit about Book will know more coming out of this film. Whedon does not disappoint his fans. He does this by keeping so many of the same elements in the film that we grew to love in the television series. The very technological CGI, the western atmosphere (though this film does feel a bit more sci-fi than the television series), and the bond between the crew (a element that you do not see in most television film adaptations) are all points that made the series great. Whedon has taken these and crafted one of the best films this year. Even three years after the final episode, Whedon remembers what brought his fans to this series. He remembers the humanity of the characters, the humbleness of Mal, and the fire that is in each of their eyes. It is about having faith (but not always about God), it is about honesty, and it is about courage and dedication. After watching this film you cannot help but feeling motivated to get up and fight for what you believe in. Mal and his crew ignite that passion within you! If I had to have two gripes about this film, they would be very small, yet still dwelling within my mind. Where were the men in the blue gloves? Remember, River always chanted, ""two by two""? There was even an episode called ""Ariel"" nearly dedicated to them. I wish Whedon had expanded with them instead of focusing so contently on this Operative. While I think the Operative was amazing, I just kept thinking about them throughout the film. The second remaining question that I had was this, ""Who was Shepard Book""? I thought out of all of the characters, even River, he was the most complex. While he is hardly in this film, he continues to force us to ponder on what is truly in his past. What makes him different, yet special at the same time? Just two simple questions that I did not feel validated by the end of the film. Small gripes, nothing huge to talk about.Overall, this movie was fantastic. It carries everything a sci-fi, western, action genre person would want. Whedon proves that he has the power to control his characters and develop honest stories that keep simple themes and devoted morals. Serenity was nothing short, to use words from my Firefly review, of perfection on a stick. Never have I finished a series, coupled with a film, only to want to start from the beginning again to see my old ""friends"" in action. I actually felt very emotional when this film was over because I really didn't want to have a final closing to this series. I wanted to know that my friends would still be out there waiting to make me laugh, enjoy an adventure, and grow challenging secrets. It is what I loved about the TV series, and it is what completed this film for me.Whedon, from Firefly to Serenity, I applaud you!! BRAVO JOSS, BRAVO!!Grade: ***** out of *****",Serenity
81,saptesh786,Serenity for River !,7,22 February 2019,Serenity is a sci-fi movie. I did not see any series of this story. But this standalone movie is right for gives you enough enjoyment. However some points of the story do not clear like memory strikes of River. We could not understand what was happened in the past. But tempo of story is taking you ahead to leave your mind back as it was. I wonder why not its sequel comes so far even till in 2019. River ( Summer Glau) is most highlighted part of the movie. Innocence face but excellent combat art is must watchable! Morena Baccarin is looking beautiful and seems like bollywood actress. Nathan Fillion is perfect in his role. I actually feel him like Flash Gordon! Chiwetel Ejiofor brilliantly plays villain! 'The 'Mr. Universe' is another attraction of the movie. Over all it is Good movie for sci-fi lovers.,Serenity
82,sarastro7,Hot damn! Better than my wildest expectations,10,2 December 2005,"For many reasons, I was not that big a fan of the Firefly TV-show, although I did find it entertaining (but not believable). But thankfully many of the things I disliked about the series almost weren't in the movie at all (the Western aspects, to be more specific). Serenity was a powerhouse of edge-of-your-seat sci-fi action, excitement, and plenty of story. And did I mention space battles? And the martial arts fight scenes? And the wonderfully brainwashed Operative? I loved it, and will definitely be going to watch it again.As I watched the movie, all the questions I had were answered in the course of it. I wondered where the Reavers had come from in the first place, and we got the answer. Some of these plot lines were probably supposed to be long-running in a series, but since there may not be another series, all the story got crammed into the movie, and it worked extremely well. Story very often seems to be too decompressed in TV series, and we just don't get very much of it, which makes it unsatisfying, even though the story itself may be very good. The end result is an impression that the writers only had a few ideas and had to drag them out for far too long to tell them. Which means that the story doesn't seem as good as it may be. TV shows still have a long way to go before they can tell good stories properly, but I admit that the Firefly show did have a complete and well-rounded story in each episode, which is good.Anyway, my only other comment is that I was surprised that we didn't see the men with blue hands in the movie. In the TV series, they seemed to be tied in with River's past in an important way, but there was no mention of them here. I don't think Whedon has forgotten them, though, because they actually appeared in the Serenity comic book prequel. So maybe, if there can't be another series or another movie, the story will continue as a comic book. That would be good. I'd buy it.I rate Serenity a straight 10 out of 10. It was spectacular.",Serenity
83,mentalcritic,...and?,2,13 December 2005,"The cult of Joss Whedon is either something he thanks his stars for, or laughs himself silly about. I am not sure which. After watching Serenity, I am inclined to say the latter. Whedon burst onto our visual consciousness some time ago as one of the writers of a dismal film called Buffy The Vampire Slayer. Biting into every trend marketed to teens of the time, and starring one of the brain-dead cast of yet another television series that personifies normalism, Buffy was received about as well by cinematic audiences as a parent receives the news that their child has been kidnapped. Somehow, Whedon got a second chance when television executives were willing to allow him to retool the Buffy concept for their medium. While I have not viewed the series myself, its inclusion of Sarah Michelle Gellar as its primary star tells me a lot more than I really need to know. Then there is Firefly. Just when James Cameron's creation, Dark Angel, was getting to some form of relevance, they canceled it to put Firefly in its place. It lasted half a season.Quite frankly, if Serenity is anything to go by, that was half a season too long. It starts out promising. Find me an Aspie in the audience who could not relate to the initial struggle shown by River Tam, the main protagonist. The problem is that once River is escorted away from the government's facility by her brother, things start to go downhill very quickly. All throughout the film, we are given hints that River is meant to be some kind of super-agent who can pull apart the government's enemies or troops like Popsicle sticks. The problem here is that we are shown little, if anything, of River's capabilities. Another big problem is that we are asked to take it on faith that the government shown in the film is universally bad. There are no shades of grey in Whedon's world, it seems (a fact that probably should have been evident in some of the dialogues I've heard from Buffy). Then there is the crew. A crew less interesting, I have yet to see in a science fiction film. We know less about them at the end of the film than we do when they are first introduced.Even discounting the total lack of investment we have in the characters, the story is as boring as watching an elderly dog lie in the sun. No, scratch that, I could watch my mother's pet silky terrier lie in the sun for two hours without checking my watch every ten minutes. Since the entire galaxy seems to be the property of this entity that serves as the evil of the story, the film often feels like an intergalactic version of The Fugitive, only nowhere near as exciting. Mostly because of one facet of X-Files Syndrome: the ruthless power of the bad guys is utterly broken down by the fact that they cannot capture or even restrain what amounts to a tiny bunch of mercenaries who mostly do not give a damn about their mission. Compounding this is the film's propensity to show, rather than tell. A classic example is when River finally whips out her weapons to fight her antagonists. The door closes on her, we see nothing, then what seems like hours later, the doors open again, showing her standing about the corpses with blood dripping off her blades. Umm, Joss? This is a visual medium! Well, to be fair, films that forget they are meant to be telling a visual story can acquit themselves. In spite of managing to do the impossible and messing up a Borg story, Star Trek: First Contact managed to entertain somewhat. One commentator has likened the TV series to Star Trek and this film to Star Wars, stating that by going the Star Wars route, Serenity loses the ""human stuff"" that supposedly made the TV series worthwhile. This is unfair. Star Wars, even the mediocre prequels, relied upon a certain human element to hold its audience. The first two prequels tried hard (and failed) to show us how a seemingly innocent little boy could slowly be turned into a monster. The third succeeds somewhat by focusing entirely on what the boy does as a monster, whereas the originals showed the monster slowly reclaiming his humanity. Serenity has nothing quite so compelling to offer.To its credit, the film does show some minor promise in the closing chapters when the origins of the Reavers are explained somewhat. Had this film been about citizens of humanity (or whatever) battling Reavers for some purpose, this could have worked. Unfortunately, the utter non-investment in the characters rears its head once more, and the film can only offer visual space battle by way of compensation. Even Battle Beyond The Stars did it a lot better than this. Hell, stories revolving around groups of people wandering aimlessly through the galaxy in search of a goal (and being presented with one not to their liking in the process) have been done better, too. So after looking at my watch for the thirtieth time, I found myself waiting in vain for a climactic moment that never comes. Sorry, Joss, but if you want to tell a story about universally-scorned outsiders, you would do far better serving as a cinematographer or second unit for someone who can actually do it. Bryan Singer or Ridley Scott being the two examples that spring to this Aspie's mind.When I give a film a two out of ten, I am trying to send a message to those fortunate enough to have not seen it yet. This message is that the film is not even bad enough to be good in a Woodian manner. Instead, it is just plain boring. Sereneity is a two out of ten film. If you want a film about an abused or neglected minority, watch Bryan Singer's X-Men films instead.",Serenity
84,Joxerlives,Good send off for the series,9,12 January 2012,"The good; Obviously benefits from a greater budget, cool opening tracking shot. Love River and Zoe's little look during the robbery, love River's goggles. Stonking great spaceship battles and the scene where they slip through the Reaver fleet is truly creepy. The bad; Mal's getting an inoculation at the start conveniently informs us that Simon is a doctor. Disappointing that we get no Saffron or Jubal Early. Kinky dinky; River voyeuristically watches her brother and Kaylee having sex. Maybe the subtexters did have a point? Kaylee appears to have been using a self-pleasuring device which horrifies Mal (who seems to like to think of Kaylee almost as his virgin daughter) but intrigues Jayne. The crew eavesdrop on Mal and Inara for gossip/thrills. Mal cross dresses again and may have gone through Inara's clothes (for her scent or to try them on?) Notches on the Serenity bedpost; Simon and Kaylee, at last Capt subtext; Note River actually sniffs Inara's bed in Kaylee's video. Mal considers Fanty 'pretty'. Total Serenity crew; 7-Inara rejoins but Book and Wash die. River now takes Wash's place as the co-pilot of Serenity. Subverting the Hollywood cliché; Facing the Reavers our heroes bravely run away and leave it to the Alliance troops to fight them, THEY save the day. The villain survives. Mal pushes the guy off the mule and leaves him to the Reavers. We never do get to hear Book's story. Mal the noble hero never hesitates to shoot unarmed people. Whedon clichés; People with subliminal triggers. Happy high-class hookers in Space; Inara is working as an instructor at a companion training school which must be the best job EVER! Alliance good or bad?; In this case Alliance bad but well intentioned, trying to create a society without violence which seems laudable but in the end turns into a nightmare. The Alliance troops defeat the Reavers, saving the crew and rebuilding the Serenity. Whilst the Alliance seems set to continue it may be very different from now on. Mal says the war is long done and Joss comments that he's put it behind him. So when he tells Simon that needling the Alliance is one of the reasons he let's him and River stay is he being truthful? Simon really looks the part of the Alliance officer in the beginning. The Operative says that Mal isn't the hero and the Alliance isn't the evil empire. Joss himself remarks that he sees the Alliance as a largely benevolent force. So, who would you have sided with in the war? I have to say that Blue Gloves aside I'd lean towards the Alliance. Fanfic; The continuing adventures of Serenity post-movie obviously popular especially with Wash dead Mal having to choose between Zoe and Inara as his love.Missing scenes; Reputedly had the series continued there'd have been an episode where Mal and Zoe are tracked down by a group of ex-Alliance soldiers intent on avenging a war crime that their Browncoat unit committed (like Principal Wood and Spike). Reminds me off; River spying on Simon and Kaylee having sex reminds me off Dawn who was quite the voyeur with Buffy and Riley. A world without violence is something Joss reuses from season 4 of Angel. The Reavers are reminiscent of John Carpenter's film Ghosts of Mars. The opening scenes are very BSG whilst one of the guns in the bar fight looks like the ones they used on Babylon 5. The new mule is very Star Wars landspeeder (did they sell the Lassiter to pay for it?). Mal shoots the guy being eaten by the Reavers, very Last of the Mohicans. Now of course Miranda (meaning 'most wonderful') is Prospero's daughter in The Tempest. We've already seen Ariel (the wonder of the Alliance?), does this make the Reavers Caliban? ""This thing of darkness I acknowledge mine"". And of course it was adapted as 'The Forbidden Planet'. River's trigger is very like Spike's in Buffy. Alien is referred to again although this is a universe without aliens (The Operative refers to 'Building better worlds' which is the company's motto). Questions and observations; So we finally meet some real Reavers (we've only met one pseudo one before in Bushwhacked). But the Serenity crew never confront the Blue-gloves? Note when we see the slaughter at Haven Jayne still takes the time to loot. Who helps Simon rescue River? The Browncoat diehards who were to try and recruit Mal and Zoe if the series had continued? The Mal we see at the beginning is much more like the Mal we see in the pilot than the series. Wash the pilot always seems the last to know everything, he's rather left out. The Alliance now use sleek ships. Mal's record shows him to be a captain in the Browncoats which is why Zoe calls him 'sir' which she shouldn't do if he's a sergeant (although if he really did command 2000 men at one point he's actually an acting brigadier). Are the Reavers all gone, did the Alliance wipe them out? Jayne plays the guitar, I wonder if he know's The Hero of Canton?. The Alliance troops have new armour, very Halo like. Jayne points out that of Mal's 30 man platoon he and Zoe were the only survivors, bearing out Zoe's assertion that a hero is someone who gets other people killed and a leader is 'something of a monster' (like ruthless Angel at the end of season 5 and hardass Buffy in season 7). 9/10, very good, if this is the last we see of the crew this is a fine send off for them. So, Firefly? Well, very enjoyable but I'd still say it's my least favourite of Joss' shows. I think the best way to put it is that Firefly had the potential to be a great series.",Serenity
85,MrGKB,"Impressed this ""Firefly"" virgin",8,15 November 2005,"Caught this baby at the dollar second-run theater and was very impressed. Extremely solid production values made it hard for me to believe that this leaped to the big screen from a TV series. Great script from Mr. Whedon, loaded with engaging dialog that refuses to insult the intelligence of the audience, while still carefully unreeling its plot with a finesse that is most appreciated by this jaded moviegoer. Engaging leads steer a great cast through seamless effects and one accepts this faux-Western space opera without hesitation. It tickled me to find out Mal was played by the same guy who was the ""wrong"" Ryan in ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and as for the little ballerina playing River--whoah! What a hottie, not to slight the rest of the femme fatales, who are uniformly attractive and talented. The men hold their own in the hunk department, as anyone can tell from the ratings given this film by the female IMDb contingent, and also show strong acting chops. Of particular note, besides Nathan Fillion as Mal, are Chiwetal Ejiofor as the bad guy and Alan Tudyk, whom I happily recognized from ""Dodgeball"" and ""I, Robot."" Highly recommended to all sci-fi action buffs, particularly those who are sick to death of cookie-cutter product. I'll be picking this one up on DVD, no question, not to mention keeping an eye peeled for a good used copy of the ""Firefly"" series. Kudos to Mr. Whedon, who is now forgiven the over-hyped ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and has finally delivered something worthy of his ""Toy Story"" reputation. I look forward to whatever further adventures Mr. Whedon may have in mind for the crew of ""Serenity.""",Serenity
86,fwomp,Snappy Dialogue + SF Action = Success,8,25 October 2005,"It would be pretty easy for me to bash SERENITY ...but I won't. The bashings can easily be directed at the lack of advancement in language, limited projectile-type weaponry, and a microcosmic-society inside the spaceship SERENITY that have reverted back to the cowboy-shoot 'em-up days.It could also be considered cliché-riddled with the lone-type gunslinger fighting against far superior numbers and odds, only to win and change the course of everything.But again, I'm not going to bash these things. So you may be asking, ""Why?"" Well ...because it works. The film is not really meant to break any new science fiction movie-making ground. It's designed to be entertaining, with exciting gun-battles, eye-popping CGI, and characters who are great to watch. From Mal, SERENITY'S captain who holds a grudge against the all-powerful Alliance, to the beautiful but lethal River, who can become a killing machine with the utterance of a word, all of SERENITY'S crew have to battle their pasts and presents and, sometimes, even themselves.The other thing that made the film fun and easy to watch was the snappy dialogue and frequent use of humor during extreme situations. It's really great to see comedy in science fiction (not since GALAXY QUEST have I enjoyed listening to this type of dialogue).",Serenity
87,carbuff,"Really good TV Sci-Fi, except that it was a major motion picture.",7,10 May 2015,"For me personally, it's definitely better than the Star Trek movies, but still feels mostly like a really well-done TV production. The sets and special effects are very good, but the actors completely fail to make any emotional connection with the audience. The story line works, but doesn't seem very original and there are countless hackneyed plot devices. Still, it's different enough to be a pleasant diversion, and it has its heart in the right place. It's really hard to find any halfway decent science fiction movies, so I think we have to be thankful for anything we can get that's watchable. Lastly, I should mention that I know absolutely nothing about the Firefly series on which this is based, so this film probably has much more meaning for fans of that series.",Serenity

Meant to be set in the future with new planets colonized and rebels against the state blah blah blah and a telepathic girl whom everyone is after....The film seems more science fantasy than fiction and all over the place with much of the movie having modern day and not futuristic ideas and things. It is all bits of Star Wars and other similar type movies etc but with no charisma or any real conviction.Many scenes appeared to be badly cloned from better sci-fi pictures. And when the lead female started to do Kung Fu, that was enough for me, so after barely 40 minutes I turned the garbage off. There was a few reasonable special effects which saves the film getting the lowest possible score, but only just, hence: 2/10.",Serenity
89,agmoldham,Typical sci-fi fayre,5,28 October 2005,I must make two admissions. I've never seen the TV-series (Firefly) that spawned this film and all but the very best sci-fi movies leave me feeling a bit numb.I found the plot of this somewhat similar to Minority Report although I didn't find it quite as engaging. River is on the run from the Alliance and has psychic abilities which help to keep her one step clear. The undoubted highlights of the film are the fight sequences which are very capably handled. Some of the acting is decidedly wooden though with Adam Baldwin being one of the main culprits. Having said that Summer Glau puts in a pretty good performance.I'm sure sci-fi fans and fans of the TV series will love this. For everyone else it's quite entertaining with a few highlights and something you will have totally forgotten about within a couple of days.,Serenity
90,MihaiSorinToma,A space odyssey,10,20 January 2018,"Mal, the captain of Serenity carries on his ship a very special girl. River, a young psychic who has been trained by the Alliance as a human weapon, was rescued by her brother and thus she represents the number one target for a merciless assassin, sent specifically to get rid of ""the evidence"". Although she is perceived as a threat by the crew, she will prove to be a priceless key in unveiling a disturbing secret, kept safe at all costs by the Alliance.It's a dramatic story filled with action and shooting while its complex characters contribute decisively to a wonderful atmosphere. You become connected to the events, start to care about the captain, River with her troubled life and the others. The action is pretty spectacular, at one point I started wondering if I was actually seeing The Matrix in space. It definitely looks great for its time although the effects are not groundbreaking. It made me enjoy it from one end to the other, it surprised me with its story and course of events and it thrilled me with its characters. A must see!",Serenity
91,TheNorthernMonkee,Quality entertainment.,9,16 May 2007,"SPOILERS Once upon a time there was a cancelled television series called ""Firefox"". Popular amongst a few of my friends, but something I managed to completely avoid, it was cancelled very early on for numerous reasons. Written by Joss Whedon of Buffy fame, it was popular amongst it's fans, and as almost a relaunch of sorts, Whedon made a film based on it. That film was ""Serenity"", and I've seen that, and remarkably it's bloody good fun.In a distant future, humanity has spread across the stars. After a bloody civil war, it has become split between the dominating alliance and an outskirts of rebels struggling to survive in the out planets. Aboard the spaceship Serenity, Mal, the captain of this motley crew is trying to make a living, whilst avoiding the alliance's forces. Unfortunately aboard his ship he has a girl with a past, and this past is about to come back and threaten everyone he cares for.Beautifully shot, and well thought out, I could go on about the great things about ""Serenity"" for ages. I'm not going to though, mainly because there is one aspect of the film which demonstrates just how clever it is.I'll confess here and now that I'm a bit of a science fiction fan. A Star Trek enthusiast (and former obsessive) since the Next Generation began when I was eight, I've seen series come and go and which have basically spent a vast period of time building up characters that we care for and bond with. As such, when you watch an one off film with no previous build up, the characterisation has to be pretty damn impressive to get the viewer hooked. Amazingly, ""Serenity"" does this with ease. Yes the characters are semi-predictable and the plot follows a remarkably familiar story pattern, but as we watch and absorb this film, we find ourselves growing attached to Mal the Captain and his rag tag band of renegades. It's impressive writing from Joss Wheldon, and if he ever branches beyond science fiction and fantasy, Wheldon could produce films to rival any other script writer. Only time will tell however.""Serenity"" is a quality action adventure film. Beautifully written and directed by a man with great potential, it is a thrill ride well worth watching. It is not difficult to see why it did so well amongst film magazine readers, and here's hoping that we get to see more of the same soon. Go watch.",Serenity
92,Carycomic,Surpasses the TV series that inspired it!,10,1 October 2005,"When I first watched the version telecast by Fox Network, I was not too impressed. And, apparently, neither was anyone else, at that time. Fox pulled the series after only three or four episodes! But, I have been watching the SCIFI Channel reruns. And, they were quite entertaining. A little more dramatic than ""BTVS the Series."" But, a lot more light-hearted than ""Angel."" And, now, all the questions concerning River Tam have been answered. Some of them confirm suspicions I had, even before those MATRIX-like theatrical previews. But, obtaining them came at a high price for the crew of the transport ship, ""Serenity."" In fact, part of that price leaves one other question unanswered. Just who was Shepherd Book before he took to guiding lost sheep (like Mal and River)? I mean; that TV-ep where the Graycoats run his ID card, and then treat him with all the fearful deference of Darth Vader, did pique my curiosity! In any event, even if you missed the series, the first time around, you'll still enjoy the movie as a one-shot, B+ space opera. So, go ahead and splurge, this lovely Saturday night: SERENITY is worth it.",Serenity
93,tomimt,You can't take the sky from me,8,1 July 2006,"At first, even though I did find 'Firefly' series appealing, I thought that the praises towards 'Serenity' were mostly stirred by Whedon fan boys. I still think there's some truth in that, but this is a film with merits in it.'Firefly' is the only Whedon production I've myself liked enough to watch it and I was somewhat saddened when the series was cancelled, even though I understood why: it never really kicked off the ground so to speak. The stage was set but the play never really went further than dress rehearsal. And now we have 'Serenity' to fix the error.Some background info of the plot line is needed to be known for this movie, as for now it's mostly clear for the watchers of the show: River (Summer Glau) was a subject in a secret government test and she was set free by her brother Simon (Sean Maher) and together they took on aboard of captain Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillon) ship Serenity. The government wanted River back badly but the series ended before we really got to see why. And now 'Serenity' is here to answer that question.The settings and atmosphere of the film is pretty similar to the series, but this time it's all tightened up and all the fat has been cut off the story. This makes the film very enjoyable to watch. Special effects are a bit boosted up from the TV, but basically the style is the same. In a couple of occasions the CGI stands out a bit, but over all the work is good.'Serenity' really is the better of the two big sci-fi films that came out 2005, the other being 'Star Wars III', though it did fail in the box office. The major reason here is, that it was clearly made for the people who watched the show, so people not having background info won't get everything out of it and secondly the cast, which is good, but not really containing reel in crowds caliber stars.It is more than likely that 'Serenity' will be the last piece of film to set in 'Firefly' universe. The major plot line of the series was ended though the possibility of a sequel was left. I guess only the time will tell.",Serenity
94,moviesleuth2,Solid effort marred by bad editing,4,17 February 2008,"There are many films out there that were probably good films but were destroyed to some degree by incompetent film editing. Such is the case with ""Serenity."" There was a good film here, but some important scenes were cut out at some point, most likely to cut down on the running time.Maybe it's because I didn't watch the series, but I found myself lost a lot of the time. I had no idea who some of the characters were, and what they had to do with the story. Particularly in a show that was canceled soon after it aired, it's a likely guess that most people who go see the movie in theaters won't have much information about the characters or their stories, if any. The characters are incredibly undeveloped for someone who hasn't watched the show, such as myself. The personalities are there, as are the performances, but none of them are fleshed out in any way.But that wasn't the biggest problem. What hurts ""Serenity"" the most is that all of the big transitions from scene to scene are non-existent. Whenever the characters did something new, I had no idea what they were doing or why. Worse, the beginning of the film's main storyline is unexplained. I had an idea of who River was, but the part of how she got on the ship ""Serenity"" and the resulting development, which one would think is crucial for access to the film, is gone. It's not even explained in words. To be fair though, I was able to piece together some sort of a plot, but the premise has been done before, and ""compelling"" really isn't a word I'd choose to describe it.The supplementary stuff that makes up the bulk of the film (the performances, the characters, etc.) is evident, but to someone with no background knowledge of the show, watching ""Serenity"" is like watching a sequel that can't stand alone without watching the prequel.",Serenity

The CGI is sub-par in a lot of scenes, even for 2005. The characters are idiots, like, they are literally dumb... more than once in the movie, they engage in hand-to-hand combat, despite having a gun, OR they shoot a single bullet then turn around, only to be back-stabbed by the person that they just shot (because OBVIOUSLY he wasn't dead from a single bullet).Honestly, if you're looking for a 'nonsensical space action film', then I would much rather recommend something like 'Starship Troopers' as a better way to spend your 2hrs.",Serenity

Having seen the DVD set, I can't say how someone who isn't familiar with the show would react but I think almost all the bases are covered. The whole production looks great, Whedon's direction is very assured if not completely used to working on the large screen. The writing is in peak form and the cast is really in full gear. The music is very good but not the same as the show. I missed the lonely country music playing while spaceships fly around. The TV theme song is also missing unfortunately. A number of people in the audience I saw it with waited thru the end credits just to hear the song.What is the most important to me is this is the first time in a really long time that I've seen a fantasy film that wasn't a cynical production of effects, committee writing and marketing spin. Even the Lord of the Rings trilogy didn't do it for me although it was an honest production. See this film and get what's been missing from Hollywood films for a long time.

100,grendelkhan,"Good film, but with problems for non-fans.",6,30 October 2005,"I have never seen a single of episode of Firefly, so I entered this movie with no background. I went based on good word of mouth and a casual browse of the promotional book in my bookstore. Although I found the movie to be well made and entertaining, it did come with some problems.Having never seen the show, it was hard to discern the various relationships. Very little is explained and I was left to infer quite a lot. Now, it is fairly obvious who is in love with whom, who are allies and enemies, etc.; but, I was left wondering about the origins of those relationships. Much of the dialogue is centered around past events that I have not seen. This made it harder to get into the film. It didn't stop me, but it took far longer to immerse myself into the world of the movie than , say, Star Wars.Also problematic was the stylized dialogue. I don't mind the Western flavor and speech rhythms, but they were a bit jarring; and, occasionally, hard to understand or even hear. It took some getting used to.Finally, some of the performances were too ""tv"" and not enough ""movie."" The acting was not always up to the format, even from accomplished film actors. Some of this may be due to the director's inexperience.With all of that said, this is a very good movie. It has an intelligent story and engaging characters. The special effects were dazzling, but always in service to the story. The action sequences were exciting and the comedic moments were funny, if occasionally overdone. It did make me want to go back and watch the series.If you've never seen Firefly, I suggest you view it first before watching the film. You will be able to better enjoy the story with more background detail. However, even if you don't see the series, the film is excellent and definitely beats Revenge of the Sith for the best sci-fi film of the year.",Serenity
101,FilmFlaneur,Serenity in Proportion,8,1 February 2006,"I've not seen Firefly, Joss Whedon's original, allegedly mishandled and abruptly cancelled TV series - a show which by now probably holds the record for having the most vocal fan base lobby since Star Trek's cancellation a generation ago. This spin off, apparently taken from the original concept for the pilot episode - although it appears to be set some months after the series, has been greeted most effusively by those who know and love the original. This while some mainstream critics, perhaps feeling that such a popular success can't be entirely worthwhile, are less than wholehearted. The truth lays somewhere in the middle. Serenity is a damn fine SF film, and one certainly a good notch above the clunkingly written Star Wars prequels, but still one that never entirely transcends budget limitations or an uninspired central story.Here are the same characters as in the series, perhaps a little older and wiser, a mixed bunch whose camaraderie and banter is one of the film's strengths and amongst whom key relationships are already formed. This could be alienating to the casual viewer, but Whedon's frequently witty dialogue, bouncing between the players, almost as an afterthought in some scenes, sparks enough to create depth and interest. Immediate familiarity is a difficult trick to pull off for casual viewers, and can leave them feeling rather like joining half way in through a private conversation (as Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children, 2005, amply demonstrated). Fortunately appreciating Serenity never depends upon detailed knowledge of what has passed before, although it's a likely advantage. Indeed part of the fun is mentally taking that half step back, reconstructing possible histories between the leads.So if there's any problem it's not with emotional baggage nor, one is pleased to report, the often brisk staging with which writer-director Whedon makes his convincing step from small to big screen (one is particularly impressed by the opening, an extended one-take roving ambitiously about the freighter, as well as his continued willingness as writer to let actors have their breathing space). No, it lies principally with the character of River, the rescued empath, whose brain contains the mighty fact the Alliance seeks to repress, as well as the nature of the dread secret itself. The idea of a tortured mentalist who holds terrible information, or a regime of forced happiness are neither very fresh in SF, and their unfolding discovery involves something of an anti-climax from those expecting Matrix-like revelations, though they serve their purpose.Fans of the series maybe revel in some of the hand-me-down elements or the genre stereotypes on show. Other viewers might find them distracting. For instance some of the locations in which the Serenity crew find themselves too often resemble the reworked mining towns of countless straight-to-video SF movies. Whedon's universe is a retro one, in which there are more than a few echoes of the western - guns are kept in quick draw holsters - with its own wild space frontier, while the cannibalistic human mutant Reevers recall Quantill's Raiders, (or perhaps the Border Reivers who plundered 16th century north of England from horseback). He shows his roots elsewhere, too, in that we have here a modern version of Hans Solo and his crew, braving their way in their patched up ships across the galaxy, a process enlivened again by a good deal of dialogue that's larded with knowing, anti-heroic nonchalance (e.g. ""Can I make a suggestion that doesn't involve violence, or is this the wrong crowd for that?"" ... ""In the time of war, we would never have left a man behind. Maybe that's why we lost"")... Such moments both humanise and add a dimension to the crew, bringing the film alive, just as they brought a touch of magic to Lucas' original inspiration. One can forgive any amount of cliché or unexceptional art design when things are done right like this, and with such witty gusto. Serenity's great popularity can be put down to exactly that: it gives pleasure in spades, through recognition of the familiar, done with huge flair. Of course the cynic might also point to the appreciation and relief of fans not presented with a franchise-happy dumbing-down of a favourite show - or indeed the lack of any decent, intelligent SF competition to be found elsewhere on screen currently, but that's a different story.Outside of the regular cast stands the Alliance's implacable agent, an intelligent man who clearly has chosen the wrong path and who, too, follows his own peculiar code of honour, including the anachronistic use of a sword. It is to Whedon's credit that what could easily have been a black and white portrait of evil, gradually gains a degree of sympathy all of his own. ""Nothing here is what it seems. You are not the plucky hero, the Alliance is not an evil empire, and this is not the grand arena,"" he says during one encounter - a typically knowing assertion and naturally, both given his guile, and what we know of Whedon's inspirations, one not strictly true. Like many of the best movie villains, he brings a degree of regret to his actions. The Alliance clearly is evil, and we think it is the agent's recognition of the fact at the end that allows some transformation of his character. But there's no sign that a defeat has caused any major disruption to the plans of the government, and further developments are likely. Perhaps sensing the ecstatic cult that this film has already engendered, the prospect of a follow up is clearly on the event horizon. This viewer, for one, welcomes the idea - although perhaps next time a larger budget, as well as a more adventurous storyline would make it all really, really memorable instead of just fun...",Serenity
102,judywalker2,Joss Whedon didn't keep his word,8,1 October 2005,"I really liked Firefly as a TV show. It was very smart, clever, interesting, funny, touching and different. Of course the powers that be didn't see any of that. Funny they let a pitiful show like Star Trek Next Generation go on for years before cancelling it; they only gave Firefly one season. Which brings us to the movie. Well I agree with one critic that I read, it was entirely too loud. Part of the reason that I liked the TV show was the quiet in space, very realistic. There were way too many explosions. The plot was passable and the characters pretty true to the show but I thought the climax was extremely weak. And killing off Shepard Book gave away what could have been a great sequel episode. The mystery of the good Shepard Book would have been utterly fascinating. Too bad.

So is it original? Definitely not. But entertaining and fresh, it sure is. I especially liked the first minutes before the opening titles. This is a great sequence.

This is so rare it's practically unnatural, but If I translate this to a TV show, that perfection is ""Firefly"". Well it used to be anyway. I loved the smart scripts, I admired the rich and growing characterization of every person on (and off) that ship, I loved the style and idea of the show and every single time the end credits would appear I would be hungering for more. But most of all, on top of everything I've just said, I loved the fact that it got canceled!!! Why? Because it's about 15 episodes that gave me (and most of us here as well) a glimpse of great television and an immense amount of true heart and spirit. It was canceled way too soon, but to me that's just the beauty of it-like a pro athlete who retires while at the top of his/her game-that takes much more strength and effort than doing it when their time truly comes. Remember Michael Jordan »back in the day« - had he stayed off the court after leaving the NBA he would still be the living legend he was then. But he returned and just kept on diminishing and lowering his status until all that was left of him was his past, outlived fame. Instead of people forever wondering how many championships he would have won or how many more records he would have broken they now know all these answers. None! Don't get me wrong now, he's still the best player that ever held a basketball, it's just that he lost his immortality.""Serenity"" is a decent movie, but just barely. Nothing impresses (except the script-as always), the story presents a good motive to find River, but stays away from exploring anything else. The crew-members are a lot less convincing than in the show (back in the day, huh): Mal, for some unknown reason, just looks pis*ed and annoyed all the time and apart from a great speech before going to war that's it!, Zoe just hangs around and does nothing special (even when her frigging husband dies), Wash says a funny joke, tries to repeat some silly, stereotypically-American retarded line about being a ""leaf""-and then immediately gets killed (I guess those reavers though it was retarded as well), Simon is struck with the same disease as Mal, Jayne, Inara and Kaylee don't get enough screen time and feel totally unused and the preacher just dies. Oh, and River, she gets a big chunk of screen time, but since it is practically her movie that's more than understandable.Legends such as ""Firefly"" only get born with premature cancellation, who wants to cancel a successful show, right. Lucky us, I thought. We'll never know where this space-cowboy crew will end up and what great big adventures await them. Well, I've just been struck with the »Jordan« effect. I now know exactly what happens to the crew, I know exactly what their last big adventure is (and it's not even that grand nor glorious) and sadly no new records have been broken!»Serenity« is much darker that the series, a tone which never comfortably fits in so I never really had the feeling I was watching an extension of the show, but rather some bad attempt of it. Nothing feels homely (which was truly an important par in »Firefly), everything feels weird, rushed and heart-less and overall Whedon messed up. This was his cherished baby, and »Serenity« was a responsibility to fans first and an experiment of movie-making second so I can't understand why he took such a different approach to it. The more I think about the movie, the less I like it, he should have left the Firefly legend live on...instead he extinguished its eternal flame. (excuse the poetic crap).NEW FANS (OR FANS WHO STILL HAVEN'T SEEN IT) TAKE CAUTION!!!6/10",Serenity
106,DavidSim240183,Dammit its great to see Firefly again!,9,2 January 2007,"Joss Whedon will always be best known for Buffy the Vampire Slayer. And what a fantastic TV series it was too! It took what could have been a completely idiotic idea (highschool cheerleader becomes slayer of demons) and transformed it into a sublime show of endlessly inventive ideas. Whedon kept the show going through an excellent cast, not to mention his expert way with crafting witty dialogue and biting satire. A triumph.But in 2002, Whedon was starting to branch off in other directions. He wanted to try something new, and did it with Firefly. Firefly was a sci-fi show about a crew of outlaws living 500 years in the future. An oppressive government, the Alliance, controls many solar systems after the Earth was used up of all its resources. Some people fought against Alliance control, but lost the war. The survivors were forced to scrape a living on distant worlds getting any work they could.Some people who fought in the war ended up on Serenity, a spaceship, on the run from the law. The crew of Serenity were a ragtag bunch from different walks of life. Captain Malcolm Reynolds (the marvellous Nathan Fillion). Zoe (Gina Torres), first mate. Wash (Alan Tudyk), ship's pilot and Zoe's husband. Jayne (Adam Baldwin), ship's gunner. Kaylee (Jewel Staite), ship's engineer.On their travels, Serenity picked up a few additional passengers who became integrated into the crew. Inara (Morena Baccarin), a Companion (fancy term for prostitute). Shepherd (Ron Glass), a preacher. And a brother and sister on the run from the Alliance, Simon and River Tam (Sean Maher & Summer Glau).Their escapades were great fun to watch. In fact Firefly is one of the greatest SF shows I've ever seen. Certainly the best since Star Trek: TNG. Each character was great, and the actors were a finely tuned unit. Getting up to everything from robberies, bar brawls, firefights and bickering. Balancing drama with an appealing sense of humour, Firefly was glorious television.But those idiots at 20th Century Fox seemed to take an instant dislike to Firefly, and killed it off after 15 episodes. A shame. There was so much potential to it, it had many more stories to tell, and it went well before its time. So I was ecstatic when Joss Whedon announced a film version was being made, Serenity. And I'm delighted to say Firefly works very well on the big screen. And all the actors slide back into their roles as if they never left.Serenity is a film that chooses to pick up some of the plot lines left hanging after Firefly's cancellation. In this case, the character of River is central to the plot. She was the most mysterious in the series. The Alliance performed experiments on her, leaving her mind fractured. Prone to psychic visions and fits of uncontrollable rage, we get to learn some of her secrets in Serenity.Also the film combines various running plots in the series. That of the Alliance and their control, and the Reavers. Now the Reavers were an interesting threat. Humans who had resorted to cannibalism, and preyed upon ships and colonies. Firefly was cancelled before we got to learn anything more about them, and in Serenity, we get to see them in action. Gruesome!I was initially concerned that the 40 minute episode format of Firefly might not work so well when stretched to feature-length. But the sheer talent of the actors and Joss Whedon's superb direction ensures things are kept moving along. In fact I was grateful for the 2 hour running time, because Firefly had quite a large cast for a TV show, and each one of the characters is given a singular moment to shine. Except for Shepherd's character. The only complaint I have is Shepherd is hardly in the film, and he was one of the reasons Firefly worked so well. As a voice of reason against Malcolm's sometimes reckless actions. That was disappointing to say the least.But as for everyone else, they're all given plenty to do. Nathan Fillion continues to impress, making a rousing leader, as well as getting plenty of great one-liners, and he's up to the action scenes too. Simon and Kaylee get to take a step further in their relationship. Zoe and Wash's marriage reaches a turning point. Jayne is still a turncoat. An hilarious one! Inara gets to take up arms. And River gets to kick ass!Whedon's broadened his horizons too. The bigger budget has allowed him to stage some pretty spectacular shootouts. On the ground. And in space. The trip through Reaver territory is a real nerve jangler. The mule chase is an exhilarating kicker of a rush. And Whedon's direction is as excellent as ever. I love the way Serenity opens as a voice-over, that turns into a schoolteachers lecture, that becomes a memory inside River's mind, which in turn is a simulation in a history file.Also the way Serenity introduces the crew in one single fluidic tracking shot from deck to deck really impressed the hell out of me. For any newcomers, Serenity does explain a few things about the future and the crew, which slows the film down a little. But not enough to ruin it, especially since Whedon continually drops in his customary witty inflections.Chiwetel Ejiofor is great too as the Operative, an Alliance assassin after River before she spills the beans on the Alliance's dirty little secret concerning the Reavers. He makes an immediate impression and wouldn't have looked out of place in the TV series. It all ends in a spectacular fashion with the crew striking a blow against the Alliance, a fight with the Reavers like something out of Aliens, and the crew changed forever by the battle.Serenity pretty much succeeds on all counts. Its great to see the crew again. Hopefully it won't be the last time.",Serenity
107,Flagrant-Baronessa,"Shame on you, Whedon-fanboys  this has gone too far",2,21 August 2006,"See, when the much heralded Snakes on a Plane (2006) was released, hit #1 at the box office and a rating of 8.4 on IMDb, it was cute. I laughed and cheered with the net fanboys as I saw a small-budgeted dark horse get vaulted into such cult status. Everyone knew how terrible it was and this was its appeal. It was cute; it was a joke. The same thing happened to Serenity, except it wasn't a joke. People actually tried to justify the film. The thing was, the rightly-canceled Joss Whedon show ""Firefly"" had such a rabid internet fanbase that Serenity was finally made as a film version. Unsurprisingly, fanboys immediately got so taken with seeing this come alive again that they creamed their pants and fell blind to its clear shortcomings, voting ridiculous ""10""s and saying this was the one of the greatest sci-fis ever made. Au contraire: Serenity is a dorky, campy, cheesy and fluffy B-action movie set in space, terribly-acted by its lead characters and with writing so bad that some of the lines may actually wound you (""We're gonna explode? I don't wanna explode!""). Even the slightest pause for serious situations and dialogue is usually interrupted by some hip one-liner from one of the characters to add a misplaced humour edge. When this serious situation is not interrupted, it falls prey to sappy sentimental clichés. From the mandatory 'psychic, misunderstood' girl to add a spiritual touch to the street-smart crew, the clichéd ""tough-chick"" (Gina Torres) of the crew, to the detached hunky hero (Nathan Fillion)  everything in Serenity has been seen someplace before. It has been done to death. While we're on that subject when the space crew set out from their spaceship to a sandy, barren outer-alliance planet and entered a bar, I wasn't sure if Whedon was homaging Star Wars, spoofing it or quietly hoped no one would catch onto the blatant rip-offs.I have watched this film twicethe first time I never finished it and the second time (desperately giving it another chance, which I rarely do with films) I was so unimpressed with what I saw that I started disliking the film. This is, just like ""Buffy"", ""Angel"" and all other embarrassing cheesy Joss Whedon teen-shows, an embarrassing mess poorly disguised as a science fiction adventure and peppered en masse with cringeworthy one-liners.2/10",Serenity
108,rajatdahiyax,This movie was only thing i needed to name an ending to Firefly!!!,8,30 June 2015,"A band of renegades on the run in outer space get in more hot water than they anticipated in this sci-fi action-adventure adapted from the television series Firefly. In the 26th century, the galaxy has been colonized by a military force known as the Alliance, but its leadership has not gone unquestioned. The Alliance was once challenged by a league of rebels known as the Independents, but the Alliance emerged victorious after a brutal civil war, with the surviving Independents scattering around the galaxy. Also wandering the edges of the galaxy are the Reavers, who have won few allies due to their violent behavior and habit of ripping apart their enemies and eating them before they're dead. Capt. Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), who fought as an Independent in the galactic war, is the head of Serenity, a rogue freighter ship whose crew includes Mal's first mate, Zoe (Gina Torres), who fought alongside him in the war, her husband, hotshot pilot Wash (Alan Tudyk), sunny but dependable mechanic Kaylee (Jewel Staite), and hard-nosed gunman Jayne (Adam Baldwin). The crew of Serenity wander the galaxy, taking on whatever work they can get, from criminal activities like smuggling and stealing to legitimately offering transport to travelers. Passengers aboard Serenity include professional ""companion"" Inara (Morena Baccarin) and holy man Shepherd Book (Ron Glass), but the real trouble aboard the ship comes with the arrival of Simon (Sean Maher) and his teenage sister, River Tam (Summer Glau). In time, the crew discovers that River has remarkable psychic powers and was being held captive by Alliance forces until Simon came to her rescue. Now the Alliance is hot on the heels of Serenity and its passengers, with The Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a sinister Alliance tracker, leading the chase. Serenity was written and directed by Joss Whedon (in his directorial debut), creator of Firefly, which only lasted 11 weeks on the air but gained a powerful cult following who rallied to get the show released on DVD after its cancellation, leading to impressive home-video sales and and an eventual motion picture deal. A couple of months prior to Serenity's theatrical release, reruns of Firefly were picked up by the Sci-Fi channel, adding even more fans to its cult following.",Serenity
109,docm-32304,Big Letdown,1,24 April 2021,"Big name cast but terrible acting, especially from the miscast Nathan Fillion. Between his bad acting and the cheesy special effects, you'd almost think this was supposed to be a spoof of the genre. To top it off, the storyline is a convoluted mess. I cannot understand how this got the rating it did.",Serenity
110,PyrolyticCarbon,"Excellent entertainment, sharp, clever, quick dialogue and big action",8,22 August 2005,"I am not quite through the entire TV series, but I am enjoying it, yet I'm not totally hooked. The thing is for me the series is still too episodic and the big story line that runs throughout the movie, River Tam, is far too frustrating to hang in with for a long period of time. I mean her lines really are nonsensical, and I couldn't see connections except on a few episodes where she would mumble something and later in the episode you would see what she was referring to and you realised, she's not just mad. So the series didn't really hook me in enough, but still, I wanted to see the movie because it was big, a premiere, two stunning ladies are in it, and Joss Whedon's clever scripting.The movie kicks off straight into the action in a very strong way. You're hooked from the opening moment, and not having seen the ending of the series, the opening is a bit of a shock too. Oh, before I go too far I will let you know that I'm going to write this totally spoiler free.This is a running theme with the movie, it's got some really good action sequences. Actually, no, it's got some excellent action sequences. Something I often notice about movies with set pieces of action is that they stand out, and the gaps between them can often heighten your awareness of the sequences and they stick out from the movie. Not here. In this film although there are sequences of action, they don't stand out from the rest of the movie, and the action actually feels constant throughout. I don't think Whedon let's up much throughout the movie.It's Whedon that does some excellent work here, bringing the movie from the realms of an early evening TV series to a harder hitting, darker and slightly more complex tale. The clever scripting of dialogue and character interplay is still here from the series, and it's been ramped up a bit more too. It's this dialogue and interplay that make the characters so alluring to the audience, making them so different but running with common beliefs keeping them together. Whedon really has to be applauded for that. It bodes extremely well for his coming movies, and hopefully another Serenity or two.He's added some to the characters too. Making the Captain more complex and revealing a bit more of his darker element, which during the second act seems to hint at a huge group split, this is not the happy band as in the series. Taking this dialogue and the interplay and turning it into a believable performance that the audience can connect with is a big job for the actors, and for the most part they pull it off really well. I'd say that some of the roles do rely on previous knowledge, as does some of the dialogue between them, but it won't spoil the movie if you haven't seen the series, just lessen the experience.There are some great moments, and really funny ones too. The Press audience I was with (and the mad row behind me of cinema staff) did laugh out loud quite a few times, and all down to the dialogue and most often from the Captain or Jayne. There's a nice little scene early on discussing grenades which tails off into a conversation behind the main dialogue, I liked that and thought it was cleverly done. It was also still keeping the same level of the writing even though you probably wouldn't hear it.The whole character introduction sequence is very well put together now that I think about it. It wasn't until late on into it I realised I was being taken on a quick tour of introduction, with the camera constantly moving around the ship and talking to each character on board. It was a nice scene for those that have come from the series, and I would think the new audience too.It's not all great though, looking back on the series the movie story is huge, and continues to build as it progresses. I couldn't help but feel that Whedon was writing this as the last outing of the Universe and that the plot had to be much, much bigger than the series and that it had to have a feeling of completeness, rounding everything nicely at the end. I'm not sure it needed to go so big, and so complete. It feels now that there is nowhere for another film to go.The ending was also a little bit of a let down, there is a crucial moment at the end which is just too neat for me, and a couple of twee scenes throughout. The before-attack-""I love you"" speech was a bit too stock and I shook my head in disbelief at how much it stuck out, but then Whedon managed to pull it back just enough with some of his clever dialogue.That is indeed the key to this movie, Whedon's writing, it's superb. The dialogue is sharp, witty, quickfire and sarcasm filled. He's also got a great understanding of how to pull the audience's strings. Tension, suspense and impending danger often twist around in a shocking or explosive moment delivering a good deal of the entertainment value. He's without a doubt a great writer and director and he shows it here, he's a great entertainer.I really liked this movie, it was great fun. However I faltered a little at the end with the storyline, and wished it could have been a little less mammoth, and a little less complete. Firefly fans will positively adore this movie, and those new to the story should love it and be interested enough to return to the series. I think it's a really safe bet to say we'll be seeing more of this crew in the future.",Serenity
111,hokeybutt,One of the Best TV Series Finales of Recent Times,7,21 October 2005,"SERENITY (3+ outta 5 stars) Yes, the filmmakers would like everyone to believe that this movie can be enjoyed without having seen the short-lived TV series ""Firefly"" (of which this is a continuation) but now that the movie has had it's chance to score at the box office the truth needs to come out: there is very little point to seeing this movie if you haven't seen the original 13 episodes (or at least *some* of them). It's kind of like watching the last episode of M*A*S*H or The Fugitive or even Buffy the Vampire Slayer without any basic knowledge of the show's history: you are just not going to get maximum enjoyment out of it. As I was watching the movie I was trying to look at it from the perspective of someone who had never seen the show before and who had no idea who these characters were. Frankly, I think the movie tries so hard to tie up loose ends from the series that the story doesn't really become fully realized. Series characters seem to be shoe-horned in (even when they have no real function in the story) just because fans of the show will expect them to be there. Compare the cast of ""Serenity"" to the cast of the first ""Alien"" movie: everything you need to know about the ship's crew of ""Alien"" is explained through their dialogue and actions as the movie progresses... in ""Serenity"" the crew's back story is too complex to be conveyed simply to a potentially new audience. But... enough complaining! While I don't think the movie really works as a stand-alone film... I think it is among one of the finest wrap-ups to a TV series I have ever seen. It is much better crafted and satisfying than director Joss Whedon's ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"" finales. The new character of the ""The Operative"" (Chiwetel Ejiofor) steals the movie with his quiet intensity... a memorable and more-cerebral-than-usual movie villain. The final confrontation turns into too much of a by-the-numbers movie climax (hero and villain meet on a high catwalk as the clock counts down to zero hour/ hero drops his gun, forcing a hand to hand confrontation/ villain beats crap out of hero until all seems lost) but by the end it manages to confound all modern-day action movie expectations.",Serenity
112,supertom-3,Surprise of the Year!,9,14 October 2005,"What we have here people is the surprise of the year. As Pirates Of The Caribbean gave everyone a good old fashioned wedgie for attention, Serenity does the same, only better. It's a movie that's genre has a history of predominant failures, and relatively few shining lights in comparison. It's sci-fi adventure more in the vein of Star Wars, than Trek but not as fantastical as Star Wars. It's a modestly budgeted yet vastly expansive piece and as many have said it is really the film that the first two Star Wars prequels should have been. It's got charm, thrills and it has the Han Solo factor and chemistry factor sadly missing from Luca's prequels.Based on an axed TV show Firefly that didn't even complete its first season, you might imagine (as small box office numbers suggest) that publicans probably think that you had to have seen the show to watch this film. I never saw Firefly and the film never berated me for that. The film does a superb job of setting the scene. You get an obligatory prologue that you believe is your typical prologue, but turns out it isn't and is really told in an interesting way. Within 5 minutes we know the gist of the universe, the central characters and we have are first inkling into the complication. Writer/Director Joss Whedon's screenplay is excellent. It's full of wit, great pacing and also some depth. The film is more than a thinly veiled reference to ideas of governments trying to enforce their views and ways upon different cultures, and their own, no matter the cost.So we have established this is a great blockbuster movie. It has an engaging and simple premise. The crew of the ship serenity pick up a doctor and his mentally challenged younger sister River. She has been involved in government testing, to harness pyschic powers she has. However this leaves her shockingly off balance and prone to subliminal messaging, that sends her into some deranged ass-kicking frenzy. She's one messed up 17 year old. When the crew of the ship Serenity take her and bro on board little do they realise they now have the alliance (think Empire in Star Wars) after them. Not really what captain Mal Reynolds wants considering his team of ex-soldiers turned intergalactic thieves, really want a low profile. They soon find themselves in trouble and Mal keeps the two passengers instead of dumping them. He wants to help find out why she is so important.The cast are great and what is extra great is that there is not one star name in the film. Not a big name in sight not even a middle sized name. What is extra great is they all give good performance. Nathan Fillion as Mal, is superb. In fine Han Solo form and his character has some depth and diversity to him. On one side he is a tough talking space thief with few morals but on the other he still has the moral code from his soldier days. He has a sense of honour, that the arrival of River seems to re-ignite. Elsewhere his crew members, Alan Tudyk, Adam Baldwin, Gina Torres, Jewel Staite, all good. Summer Glau is also very good as the enigmatic River. Particularly superb is Chiwetel Ejiofor as the Operative. Hired by the alliance for his hunting skills. He is a calm and quietly spoken baddie with genuine eerie menace.Whedon makes his big screen directing debut and while he could easily have made the film end up feeling TV, this is very much a big movie. It's directed with obvious passion and vision. This film could so easily have been another Lost In Space, but it is not it really ranks as one of the best space epics. Elsewhere the film looks great and has a very good score from David Newman, who manages to avoid ripping off Star Wars.The film also has cracking action with space battles that would make George Lucas rub himself against a table leg with glee! Then there are some cracking fight scenes as Glau goes rampaging with grace and skill against anyone in her local vicinity when she's in nuts mode.Overall it's a great surprise and a most pleasant one. Immensely enjoyable and following the sci-fi adventure formula whilst also happy to occasionally break from and expand on it. The film really has plenty of surprise and isn't afraid to something very un-Hollywood and sucker punch you right in the nuts. ****1/2",Serenity

Incredibly engaging from the eerie then utterly shocking beginning to the very mellow and fulfilling end. It was a film made to give the Firefly fans a true ending to the saga and it succeeded in doing so, while also becoming easily accessible and immensely enjoyable to those who have never even heard of the wondrous universe that is Firefly. Every member of the cast works so well and it's a true joy that Whedon got everyone from the show to come back for this remarkable end. Nathan Fillion works his normal awkward charm and charisma, once again embodying one of the most likable characters of all time.

I simply do not understand why. The film is an extension of a TV-show, FireFly, and to me it really shows. The movie is clearly a TV-movie. The plot is nothing to write home about, the acting is TV-quality and the special effects are generally substandard.I have not seen the original TV-show but I wonder if it's mostly die-hard fans that have been for this movie? If this would have been a SyFy-channel production I would have been positively surprised. However it is not and with the rating this movie has received I have to say that I am quite disappointed instead. It really feels more like it should have been a double-episode of the original TV-series. As such I would probably consider it a decent episode but nothing more.",Serenity
115,dilbertsuperman,Make sure you watch the entire Firefly television series before watching SERENITY,7,2 October 2009,"Firefly the series is similar to Andromeda the series yet it manages to keep it's own unique flavor- but being a fan of both series I can't help but see a ton of similarities. Serenity is the movie based on the Firefly series- about an ex-soldier turned captain after the battle of Serenity Valley lost the war against the alliance and made him live on the run, taking jobs as he can using his spaceship to transport cargo and the occasional unusual passenger.PLOT: two of the passengers he picks up are a doctor and his sister(who was worked on by the Alliances' Mengele- style doctors which resulted in turning her into a psychic with battle skills that can pop out at any time- the rest of the time she's a bipolar weepy wisp of a girl).The alliance is after them, they want their weapon(her) back.. and in between all of that, they need to pay their bills by running criminal jobs using their space ship and their warrior skill as their main tools.This is a space adventure, with plenty of planet-side action and a dash of romance here and there.For people that know the series: All the characters are pretty much the same but Kaylee the Engineer is 20 pounds lighter, so she doesn't have that same farm-girl sexiness she had in the series.The alliance assassin is played by a new actor, and the fight scenes are pretty good.. not top notch but reasonable.",Serenity
116,nobbytatoes,slow start to good finish,7,1 October 2005,"Mal and his motley crew are bandits on the ship serenity. One of their passengers though; River, is not what she seems. She's a psychic and has stumbled upon a government cover-up, which the alliance will stop at nothing to keep hidden. On their trail is The Operative, an assassin to kill River and all who protect her. Though this assassin has ideals. He wants to create an Utopian society, which he believes will happen once he has destroyed all those like Mal and his crew; ones he believe stand for chaos and defiance.I didn't see the series fireflies from which this was based, so at first i was abit apprehensive and kept wondering to myself what has Joss Whedon done to himself; this isn't the man i see who did Buffy and Angel. Though this did have a rocky start, this does get better as it moves along. This is like a cowboys and indians, but in space.The acting from all the cast is so camp and cheesy, but it actually works here. They all have their charm and if they did act all serious it would have ruined it, this movie is meant to be fun. Nathan Fillon as Mal is charismatic and is like an anti Robin Hood. He steals from the rich, but keeps it for himself.Though what i felt did faulter was the comic relief. I didn't find myself laughing at the jokes. Basically no one laughed in the session i went to. But they like myself probably didn't see the series and kinda felt like outsiders. But what raised this fault was the action sequences; they are quite spectacular. The dog fight with the alliance ships and the reavers was so well done, though it was short lived; but it was still great and quite breath taking. All the action was well directed by Whedon and is fast passed. Though Joss Whendon i did feel fell into the Spielberg trap; he made the ending to sentimental, i shuddered i few times at some of the sentimentality, but its easy to get over.From something that made me skeptical at first to having a lot of fun, Serenity is one to watch.",Serenity
117,Hunky Stud,Where are the Chinese?,8,30 September 2009,"I started watching ""Firefly"", the TV show first. once in a while, the actors speak broken Chinese which no Chinese can understand at all. It made me wonder why they are speaking fake Chinese? That doesn't make any sense, I thought that maybe the director wants people to believe that those people are speaking a new inter-universe language, so he picks Chinese. So as long as those actors speak something which English speaking people can't understand, it is OK. By the way, Zac Efron appeared in one of the TV episode, he spoke some good Chinese. It was cute.Then I watched the extra on the movie DVD, the director thought that USA and China are the two superpowers, so in the future, those two countries will merge into one. That is why all US citizens know how to speak Chinese. That is fine, but where are the Chinese in this movie? There was none. After all, if he thinks that China will be a part of the future universe, how come he didn't hire any Chinese actors? None of the shipmates was Asian. And there was hardly any Asian faces in this movie at all.Second, some of the ""Chinese"" characters shown on the billboards, dashboards on the machines are not really Chinese. Most of them are Japanese characters, and they don't even make any sense at all. It can't be that hard to hire someone in Hollywood who actually understands Chinese to put some real Chinese characters on those things.Third, the secret at Miranda is not so interesting. And I don't see how Kaylee was able to know the secret herself? And for anyone who haven't seen the original TV show, it might be confusing for them how the doctor got on Serenity at the first place.Comparing with the TV show, the special effects were much better. Even the dashboard on the Serenity looks better. Overall, it is a good movie, but somehow I felt that this movie has too much dark tone. It seems that they used a lot of yellow or brown filters when they were shooting most of the scenes.",Serenity
118,Trevor-Kerensky,As a reunion movie it worked,8,23 February 2019,"I hadn't touched the original series before this came to theaters, but I watched the movie first. It was really good and I enjoyed it. I've only seen it once but part of me wants to watch it again and also revisit the series (which I've seen some episodes of in the past). The Firefly/Serenity series is now one of my favorite sci-fi series along with Star Wars, Star Trek, StarGate, StarCraft, and Dune. Those are the names that will last a very long time. With the help of iTunes, I got all the episodes of the series and the movie, so I'll watch them soon. You should too. This same movie also brought our favorite space nomads back for another live appearance. But see the series first (all fourteen episodes!).",Serenity
119,Quicksand,Easily One of the Top Two Action Films of 2005,10,7 October 2005,"I don't understand the haters of this movie; it seems like everyone who has something negative to say has either never seen it, or only saw an episode or two of the TV show ... and yet they think they know what's going on. Regardless of what anyone says about the TV series that preceded the film, this film-- in a word -- rocks.Every character is fully realized and perfectly embodied by the actor who plays him or her. Every scene finds a spectacular balance between drama, humor, action, violence. It's just so well-written I can't put it into words. The actors are superb, the dialogue is A-Plus, the story is engaging, easy to follow, never boring, never what you think. Like, say, ""Empire Records,"" this is a movie where you WANT to spend two hours with these characters, just to be near them for however long you can. But where ""Records"" was a romantic comedy, this one here is a big sci-fi epic that somehow finds a way to be equally enjoyable, while pushing every boundary of the PG-13 rating (violence, yes; emotional impact, hell yes; sex, not at all).For the cinema nerd, the cinematography and shot-composition are a joy to behold. For the casual fan, it's a rip-roaring, rollicking pirate adventure, like if Han Solo had never met up with Luke, or if Captain Kirk didn't have all those namby-pamby, sissy regulations to follow (and Spock was a stone-cold ex-marine). I loved the lighting. I loved the sets, and my only real complaint is about the costuming-- a nitpick and maybe you won't even notice, but after everything I've said, there's really no reason for the pilot to wear a uniform, nor for The Operative to look like Blade (perhaps the costume designer is either lazy, or merely ignorant to her craft and/or the script). Her shoddy work notwithstanding, I just want to watch the movie again and again.Every time I've seen the movie, the audience has applauded (only other time that happened this year: Batman Begins). People I've taken to the movie, who never watched the show, had good things to say about it. The actors aren't famous, you may not know the name Joss Whedon... but in 1977, you didn't know the name George Lucas, and this film is way, way, WAY better. Yeah, I said it, and you should see the movie before you argue the point. All movies should be this good, this is just a great time at the movies. Alas, alas, alas.......",Serenity
120,brenttraft,Cowpokes in Outer Space,7,1 October 2005,"I had never seen the TV show ""Firefly,"" but the film version ""Serenity"" is an entertaining film which is good for a pleasant diversion.""Serenity"" has more in common with the original Star Wars or the original Star Trek, than the darker recent incarnation of the two franchises. The banter is light and casual, which serves to humanize the characters.The acting is decent, but no one in the cast is likely to be the next Harrison Ford. It's not that they are bad, but they lack charisma. The only one with personality that actually stands out is the bad guy, played by Chjwetel Ejiofor.The directing by is surprisingly good; much better than the recent Star Wars film. The opening sequence of the film uses an ingenious technique which I don't want to give away. Be sure to watch for it when you see the film. The rest of the film runs at a steady clip. Joss Whedon makes good use of the widescreen format and film has a nice look to it.The special effects are a bit on the cheesy side, but that might be intentional. The computer generated effects have a cartoon look to them, and some of the scenes with spaceships look like they were done with plastic models, like effects made 30 years ago.The story is about your basic government cover-up with a subplot about a brother's devotion to saving his sister from evil experiments, all while being chased by cannibals from outer space. In other words, it's good, clean fun.""Serenity"" a mindless, popcorn munching, good time. This comes as a nice alternative after a summer of dark, depressing, comic book films. This could be a film that both the red states and the blue states can enjoy.",Serenity
121,mgd_m,Awful,3,4 July 2021,"Two hours of one-dimensional characters, cheap direction, cheap music, and bad humor. The story is a perfect anticlimax that starts with the intriguing premise of the mysterious girl, then melts into pulp nothingness. Serenity is an awful wannabe classic saga, and it never comes close. I'm quite upset for wasting two hours over this unexcusable 7.8 rating.",Serenity
122,curtis-8,"Extra time, extra action, extra $ don't add up to more.",7,21 May 2010,"I like the movie ""Serenity,"" but not as much as the television series. In fact, I think that the movie would have made a better 2-part series capper than it does a theatrical feature film. I understand that the action scenes were necessary in order to justify a big screen release, but I don't think they were done in a way that added much more than movement. (For example, the big Reivers chase scene was no different from any number of others I've seen in other films, and the scene in which River wipes out everyone in a bar is pretty much the same as one in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."") But as I said, the addition of BIG ACTION was unavoidable if the thing was to play on the big screen. And to be honest, the BIG ACTION sequences only made the already draggy segments of the actual story seem all the slower.But for me, the extra effects and extra money spent on this capper to the Firefly series didn't do it any favors. Nor did the extra time spent writing and shooting it. It all seemed over-considered and a bit canned. The dialog between the actors, while still fairly clever, is delivered flatly as though they were on their 45th reading of the same line. The dialog on the TV show was very clever, but it was also snappy, quick, and had a freshness to it. The plot twist about the origins of the Reivers was great, though, and elevates the film as a whole. But I still think that the project would have actually been better had it been produced under the time and money limitations TV imposes.",Serenity
123,refresh_daemon,"A little television-ey, but still pulls together well",7,1 February 2007,"Well, I watched this film on DVD because I missed it in the theater. After having watched the Firefly series rabidly, I was glad to see everything wrapped up.I'd have to say that this was the best science fiction film released in a little while. The characters were more fleshed out, the movie wasn't based on spectacle (although it certainly had it), the plot was decent and the dialogue wasn't stupid. All these things are rare in science fiction films and this one just happened to have so many precious qualities.That said, although the film does manage to stand without needing to watch the show, I think that, in the end, seeing the show makes the film far more meaningful, as the characters backstories become deeper and the interactions are more sensical. The film also does a slightly better of job of making some of the more mysterious elements of the television series more plausible, like the ""reavers"".I think one of the weaknesses of Serenity is that it still feels sort of television-ey, at least through the earlier parts and the plot progression doesn't quite get to be filmic until about halfway through when the underlying plot kicks in.Nevertheless, this is one of the better moments of science fiction on either television or on the big screen and I'd have to say it was quite enjoyable. It didn't pack an immense emotional ""oomph"" most of the time, except for watchers of the television show who are invested in their characters. The film also had a little trouble focusing because of its plethora of central characters. Still, it pulls it together enough for me to recommend it.It's even more recommended to watch the series beforehand and it will make the film richer. 8/10.",Serenity
124,williampsamuel,The Epiloge Firefly Deserved,9,15 January 2015,"During its brief run on the Fox network, Joss Whedon's Firefly was one of the most original, one of the best acted, and certainly the best written program on TV. It had high production values, a large, talented cast, and presented a view of the distant future far grittier than Star Trek or Babylon Five. But alas, audiences just didn't seem ready for the sci-fi western, and due to low ratings, the show was cancelled partway through its first season. One reviewer gave it a fitting epitaph when he said that Firefly ""Got more done in one season than most shows do in five."" But the idea wasn't dead yet. Whedon couldn't get another network to take up the show. But he did get Universal to help him turn it into a movie: Serenity. With everything that made Firefly great, plus a larger budget, Serenity is one of Whedon's best projects yet. It gets as much done in less than two hours as Firefly did in a whole season.For those of you that didn't watch the show, Firefly followed the exploits of Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillon), captain of the bulk freighter Serenity, as he and his crew do their best to make a buck and stay ahead of the law on the edge of settled space. This is made harder when the ship picks up the seemingly innocent Dr. Simon Tam. But it quickly becomes clear that they've gotten in way over their heads when it turns out that Simon has smuggled aboard his sister River, who he freed from a secret government project aimed at creating living weapons. Now the good ship is carrying a girl who is not only deadly and insane, but also the most wanted woman in the galaxy.Serenity starts right about where Firefly left off. Captain Reynolds and his crew are still hauling cargo and pulling heists in the lawless galactic frontier, and the Central Alliance is still looking for River. Only now they've called out the big guns. The good ship and crew are now pursued by the man known only as The Operative. He has no name, no past, and as far as official records are concerned, he does not exist. He is brilliant, resourceful, and firmly believes that killing River is only necessary, but the right thing to do. And he's not our heroes' only problem; River's programming is beginning to resurface, along with the key one of the galaxy's most devastating secrets.One Firefly's- and Serenity's greatest assets is its delightful array of characters. There's Kalie, the rough-cut country girl and mechanical prodigy who keeps the ship flying, Wash the wisecracking, happy-go-lucky pilot, and Jayne, the ship's hired muscle. He's as big and dumb as they come, but he's definitely the kind of guy you want on your side in a fight. Just make sure you pay him well; he has little that can be mistaken for loyalty. There's Zoe, the Serenity's second-in command, an old friend of Malcolm's from the war and a devoted husband to Wash. Then there's Simon, the polished, soft-spoken but determined ship's doc, and River, once a genius, before the Alliance cut up her mind, taking her ability to block out unwanted feelings and thoughts. Now she mostly stays quiet and keeps to herself, when she isn't suffering horrible nightmares or going through dangerous hallucinations.But by far the most interesting and complex character is Captain Malcolm Reynolds. He's a liar, a thief, and a scoundrel. He's arrogant, cocky, and perfectly capable of being either smarmy or overly blunt, depending on the situation. He has no problems with killing, and has followed no cause except survival since the disillusionment of the war. But he cares far more than he would care to let on about the people under his command, and although he'd be the last to admit it, he's got a conscience in that head or his. He reminds me of Han Solo, but with every part of his personality cranked up a notch.Firefly featured lots of action, and thanks to its larger budget, Serenity takes things several steps farther. There are absolutely stunning fight scenes that resemble Buffy crossed with a Hong Kong martial arts flick. There are also chase sequences and a gun battle out of Day of the Dead. They even included a massive space battle. All of these scenes have been shot and choreographed with the utmost skill, and the special effects, while not state of the art, are still quite impressive.And unusually for an action flick Serenity carries a clear message about the power of beliefs, for good or for evil, and about how no government or authority can ever create a perfect society. To try is only to bring about tyranny and horror. This message is even more surprising coming from an avowed atheist, which Whedon is.My only real complaint about this movie is that a few pieces of fairly important dialogue are hard to catch, other than that I really can't think of anything. If you haven't yet watched the series, definitely watch it first. You'll get to know the characters a lot better and parts of the movie will make more sense. But even for those who come in uninitiated, it's still fairly easy to follow. Serenity is one hell of a movie, and I only wish it could have gotten a proper theatrical release.",Serenity
125,Maleplatypus,"Firefly, keep on flying!",10,7 October 2011,"As a part of a TV-series Firefly (or separately), this is also one of the best movies ever made. If you miss this (both series and the movie), your life here on Earth had no meaning and is worthless. This movie (and the TV show Firefly) should be a part of teaching process on academies. Here and there literally everything in a movie is in the right place in the right moment and with optimal quality. This is it. An example of how movies should me made, why and for whom. A digression: Firefly is a spaceship class, and Serenity is her name.Anyway, I'm never getting bored watching this movie (an series) over and over again, each time discovering some new detail. I'm not only recommending it, but will grow very angry if you don't. You don't want that to happen. Now, go and rent/buy it, add all the episodes of Firefly (sadly, only one season and only 14 episodes) and don't come back here until you watch it all and become a browncoat.",Serenity

That being said, I have seen the show Firefly so my rating will be dictated by that fact. This is a true sequel to the show and therefore, most of the story and emotion is predicated on the viewer having built up a certain amount of investment to take full effect. There were some minor changes where they altered some of the canon in order to explain things to new viewers and I didn't really care for that much but everything else was perfect. The cast of characters was the same group of beloved and diverse people from the series. The acting was fantastic, the charm was still there, the special effects were obviously improved, and they kept the little things that made fans fall in love with the show years ago. Most importantly, however, they wrapped up the loose ends. This is the conclusion Firefly and the fans deserved.",Serenity
127,CineCritic2517,"So bad, it's laughable..",1,10 June 2007,"I believe that what makes this flick the painful disaster it surely is, has something to do with three lacking ingredients.**spoiler in plot description** 1. Decent plot. As I was reluctantly watching the movie I could barely make sense of what I was seeing. A spaceship captain transporting some enigma-chick with a bad temper who (of course) held some secret. After 1,5 hours of agonising film-making we find out that on some planet they accidentally created some zombies out of the residing population in an endeavour to sedate the population to make them less aggressive with an airborne gas. The enigma-chick knows this and that's why she is being pursued by the mean Morpheus wannabe of the federation to prevent her from telling.**end spoiler**Doesn't this all sound a bit childish and familiar? Surely anyone who has seen some episodes of Star Trek (Voyager) got a taste of some far better story plots than this unimaginative drivel...2. Feasible screenplay This has to be the worst script I've heard in years. Over paced, unclever, cartoonish, unfunny etc 3. Believable characters Even in comic books the characters have to be believable to some degree, even if they are stereotypes. None of the characters in this movie were anywhere near believable. None of them are introduced and it is only after 1,5 hours of watching that they slowly emerge from the cheap moulds they were made in. Of course, this is about 1,3 hours too late.The general reason of this complete failure? total lack of imagination, rehashing bits and pieces from far superior shows and films in a most annoying and un-entertaining way.",Serenity
128,rparham,Serenity Now!,9,28 October 2005,"Only once before in history has a science-fiction television series met it's demise on the small screen only to be resurrected on the big one. That television series was Star Trek, which was resuscitated by the release of Star Trek: The Motion Picture in 1979, a full ten years after the cancellation of the original television series. Now, writer-director Joss Whedon has attempted to recapture that same phenomenon with the release of the film Serenity, which is a filmic version of his short-lived, but much-admired, television series Firefly, but this time without the decade wait (Firefly aired on Fox in the Fall of 2002). I am proud to say that, as a fan of the original Firefly, Serenity does a good job of recapturing most of what made the original series so enjoyable, and is one of the high points of my recent movie-going.For those unfamiliar with the premise, Serenity is set in the distant future, where humanity has colonized a new solar system filled with planets and moons terraformed to support life. The solar system has come under the control of the Alliance, who, led by a Parliament, went to war with the outer planets in the solar system to attempt to control the entire range of worlds. Set several years after that war, that the outer planets, the film focuses on a group of outlaws led by Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), who fought in the war on the side of the ""Independents"", who live on a small, seemingly well-worn spaceship named Serenity. Reynolds and his crew, pilot Wash (Alan Tudyk), first-mate and old war buddy Zoe (Gina Torres), young engineer Kaylee (Jewel Staite) and hired gun Jayne (Adam Baldwin), commit petty crime against the Alliance with the intention of keeping themselves in the air and tweaking their foes at the same time. Recently, Mal has taken on two refugees, Simon (Sean Maher) and his sister, River (Summer Glau), who are on the run from the Alliance. River had been experimented on by the Alliance at a secret location, making her difficult to handle, and Simon broke his sister out of her captivity, leading for their need to take refuge on Serenity to stay one step ahead of the law. River is proving to be an important prize for the Alliance, however, as they have sent an Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor), essentially an assassin, to recapture River at all cost. This leads Mal to attempt to stay one step ahead of the Operative, seeking a hiding place with a former crewmember, Book (Ron Glass) and attempting to save former passenger, Inara (Morena Baccharin), who the Operative intends to use as bait, all while avoiding a group of humans named the Reavers, who have gone mad at the edge of space and taken to mutilating themselves and anyone they come across.As with anything else Joss Whedon has created, Serenity (and Firefly before it) has some rather strong dialogue, with a good comic bent to it. All the characters are personable, entertaining individuals, who all make a decent impression on the viewer. Some are a bit more developed than others, and the film obviously has a strong focus on Mal, as well as River, and the best comic relief is mostly provided by Adam Baldwin's Jayne, a character that is a few beers short of a six-pack. The film's wit is infectious, making Serenity a good romp at times. Which is not to suggest that the film doesn't have it's serious side, it does. Whedon has provided his film with some nice action sequences and plot is interesting and important to the unfolding of the film, not an afterthought as in so many other recent blockbusters.The film's characters are all embodied by capable actors, with the two standouts being Nathan Fillion as Mal, and especially Chiwetel Ejiofor as the Operative. Fillion has a natural gift for comedy, making Mal fun to watch, but can play the straight man when necessary also. But Ejiofor is the standout. He turns in a great performance, creating a man who is calm, intelligent and very self-aware of his status as the villain of the piece, yet absolutely ruthless when necessary. It was reported that originally Universal wanted a ""big-name"" actor in this role to help sell the film, but backed off, and that is a blessing, because Ejiofor is terrific.For a film produced for far less than the average blockbuster (the budget was reportedly under $40 million) Serenity is decent looking film, although it's low-budget roots do show through occasionally. The film's visual effects are accomplished, occasionally belying their computer-generated nature, but still more than adequate to the task. But, honestly, Serenity is not really about big special effects or fancy sets. It's heart is in it's characters and it's charm is it's entertaining nature. For anyone looking for a good time at the movies, I recommend Serenity whole-heartedly.",Serenity
129,kooleshwar,Great movie but not as great as the fans would like you to believe.,7,28 June 2006,"Before anything let me tell you that I am a sc-fi movie buff and my original rating for this movie was an 8 (actually 7.5) but after seeing that much greater movies ( namely star-wars) got an 8.4 I decided to reduce the ratings to 7.The only reason I rented this movie is because I read of this movie in the featured section of this site. I rented this movie with high expectations and I am glad that this movie met most of those expectations.The most important aspect of this movie is that it has clearly been inspired by Starwars. In fact I can go as far as saying this movie is an Ode to star-wars. The signs are all there the escapees from a totalitarian and ruthless government, one of whom does not know about the power he/she possesses (luke sky-walker?), the old rusty ship which still rises to the occasion (millenium falcon ?), the criminal captain with a heart of gold and humour to go with it (hans solo?), the ruthless assassin who unquestionably follows his orders ( Darth Vader?).......you see what I mean don't you....And frankly speaking this is still the best part about the movie BUT..... while I expected a hard hitting, cutting edge R-rated action instead I was delivered a pg-13 rated completely sanitised package. I mean if a movie inspired by star-wars wants to be called great it cannot do so by delivering a similarly rated content (pg-13). Joss Whedon is an established personality with a devout and large fan-base surely he needn't have gone the ways of most action and sci-fi films and made another movie suitable for all audiences.The movie has its moments though...and even then it delivers some solid entertainment.The acting and characters of this movie are great considering it consists largely of unknown faces (im from India remember). All the characters are likable but the two that stand out most are ones on 2 opposite sides. Alan Tudyk as the comic pilot and Chiwetel Ejiofor as the ruthless operative clearly stand out and steal the show (the operative especially with an unexplained loyalty and cynical attitude was great). The sea of unknown faces delivering a commendable performance adds that extra bit to the movie.The special effects of the movie were OK and can be described as run of the mill compared to todays movies.The sets, background score, and locations were again good but the least you can expect from an A-list film.Where this movie really scored again are the one liners. This movie is scattered with a liberal dose of one liners and most of those and the scenes that accompany them are memorable. Just the quality of the one liners insures that this movie has at least a dozen memorable scenes which is a phenomenal achievement.Also the unclear aspect of the movie may put of some but was an added appeal to me. Just so that you know THIS MOVIE IS ABSOLUETELY UNCLEAR ABOUT MOST THINGS. I'm not to sure even the fans know the entire details.The action scenes held a lot of promise but were again sacrificed to the ratings. However one scene that stands out is the bar-fight.All in all a good sci-fi movie that delivers more due to one liners and cast performance than anything else. Recommended for all those who like sci-fi and action movies.s PG-13 rating, so-so end, run of the mill cinematically, so-so sci-fi +/-s absolutely unclear, no big actors, star-wars inspired.+ s dozens of memorable one-liners and quotes adding up to a dozen great scenes, great performances, great characters (the operator especially), meets expectations..total 8/10 (because it met expectations in absolute sense more of a 7)",Serenity
130,JaydoDre,A picture that is as genius as it is complete,9,9 December 2007,"Sometimes there comes a movie so satisfying that it becomes a landmark in filming history. It becomes Conan the Barbarian, it becomes Scream, it becomes Die Hard or Titanic. It is not necessarily great from all aspects, but its pieces come together to make it a complete and juicy fruit to remember. Serenity is one of these movies.Serenity is a futuristic epic about a group of smugglers, veterans of a conflict in which they were on the losing end, coming into contact with a girl who carries with her several important secrets. Soon enough the girl brings large trouble to the crew.The movie has its weaknesses, notably in the logic of some storyline moments, but these flaws can be easily excused as side-effects of any action movie.Serenity is based on the show Firefly. Not having seen the show itself, I can declare Serenity to be a perfect standalone. Its storyline, which is that of an interesting chain of conspiracies, is a good base for a space drama. The story touches many social situations and highlights a few of humanity's biggest moral dilemmas. The makers weren't afraid to introduce a clear message that keeps appearing throughout the movie.The actors really do a great job handling the actions scenes as well as executing jokes on the side, the main character Nathan Fillion is particularly noticeable. The fact that Serenity is based on a show with the same crew might have something to do with this.There is a full array of up-to-date special effects the viewer can appreciate, but I guess the makers had to do a good job with the eye candy, seeing how most of the action is happening in space. The Western costumes and Winchester-like rifles are enforcing the characters' style of the freedom loving cowboys, while their enemies from the republic are shown as an organized Roman machine.Serenity is a large film but the time isn't wasted. It has jokes, morals, action, involving conversations, love, hate and pretty much everything else that can be shoved into a good movie.",Serenity

132,KissEnglishPasto,SERENITY - Is Everything But!,7,1 August 2016,"From PASTO, COLOMBIA-Via: L. A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FLMovies inspired by TV shows have always inspired my mistrust. Worse still, if the genre of the film is Sci-Fi! Upon reviewing Serenity's stats on IMDb, before seeing it, I found myself looking at a rating of 8 out of 10 ... Incredibly high! Among the 100,000 titles contained therein, Serenity has to be among the 300 highest. However, as Sci-Fi movies frequently have legions of fans that rate it ""10"", sometimes there is quite a breach between the reality of the film and it's apparent rating! Consequently, I went to see Serenity with relatively low expectations. Well, there are still surprises in life! Although I wouldn't quite give it an 8, SERENITY has much more going for it than against it. The cast, as is almost always the case in the genre, is composed of little known actors. (Except if you're a fan of the canceled Firefly series, which served as inspiration for the film.)From the get-go, I noticed something that really caught my attention. The three main female roles are played by Gina Torres (Cuban-American), Morena Baccarin (Brazil) and Summer Glau (San Antonio, Texas, an American city whose population is nearly 50% Mexican-American). All three women have a very Latin look, yet, at no time, is there ever any mention of their ethnicity. Now, I don't know about you, but as far as I can remember, this is the first time that I've ever seen this! In fact, this is quite a cinematic event, because now Latinos can be assigned all sorts of roles, not just Hispanic ones! There is absolutely NO serenity in Serenity! A tad violent, at times, but nothing really excessive, when taking into account its genre of ""Action / Adventure / Sci-Fi / Thriller"". The scenes where CGI us used are well executed. They combine good action scenes, a certain originality, outstanding visuals, and a script that never tries to overcome the context and tone of the story, as us the case in many other films.As for dialog, there is usually a true skill and deft coolness in the use of language that is not heard and in many dramatic films. In the opening scenes, the acting seems somewhat under par, but the as SERENITY progresses, you see that the performances achieved, usually are in good agreement with the characters. At the end of the day, Serenity achieves a good dose of action and suspense...7*.... ENJOY / DISFRUTELA !",Serenity

The Alliance send an assassin to bring River Tam back, while Mal and his crew find out how powerful she is and the truth about the hidden planet Miranda and the origin of the cannibals Reavers.I have to admit, before watching this film I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I haven't seen the TV series 'Firefly' from which this film originated from and I haven't had a single clue about the whole 'Firefly-Serenity' universe. The reason I decided to watch this film is because of the high rating that it got from the #1 movie web source of all time, IMDb.

135,grandmastersik,Abysmal,1,14 May 2016,"This came on TV the other night and I thought, ""Cool, a sci-fi action flick, I'll check it out."" Sadly, the film is ridiculously camp, self-referential and clearly catering for 10 year olds... it also turns out that it's based on some TV series, which explains why there's so much exposition: the writer/s obviously felt that their 10 year old viewers needed to get up to speed on everything that wasn't in the programme.If you're a 10 year old, you may enjoy this, but for adults, it's bad acting, cheesy dialogue and the fact that it takes itself seriously on top of all this, makes it pretty much unwatchable. I turned it off, hence the 1 rating.Recommended for fans of the programme (which explains its high IMDb rating) and 10 year olds.",Serenity
136,Semisonic,Goofy with a touch of brilliance... or the other way around,9,12 April 2015,"There are quite a few space movies out there, and i've seen most of them. Yet there's nothing quite as like as Serenity. It's just one of a kind, for what it's worth.By the first impression it makes, one is tempted to say that if Guardians of the Galaxy were to be made nine years earlier, with a so-so budget but with wits to compensate for it tenfold, then that's how it might've turned out. Both GotG and Serenity try to play it fun and quirky from the start, but to me only the latter actually managed to pull it off. Serenity looks as cheap as it is, and you can't help but notice. But there's something more to the space adventure films than just the visuals.I must admit that i never watched Firefly (on which Serenity is apparently based), yet with all that cult following one could expect to be in for a treat. But, thankfully, this film was made back in time when it didn't know that yet. So the most unique thing about Serenity is that it seemingly doesn't even try to impress you on purpose. Instead, it just plays its usual gig, while you're simply allowed to stand by and watch.Not being too self-centered is probably the thing that GotG lacked in my opinion. Trying to be cool and funny and all, it crossed the line beyond which easygoing becomes obnoxious and jokes start tasting somewhat forced. Serenity, on the other hand, behaves like an old funny guy who's just tired to pretend and now does it dead serious - which actually makes it both cool and witty. If you recall Bill Murray in Lost in Translation then you know what i mean.Love for Serenity doesn't come in an instant, you do have to work your way to it. After all, it's a rather chaotic story with characters nobody even tries to formally introduce and a goal that's hardly there even after the credits start rolling. There's no saving the Universe from any sort of tyranny, or fighting the almighty foes. The movie never pitches itself to you, instead, it takes you as a slightly unwelcome witness who can watch as long as he or she doesn't ask any dumb questions.And if you can deal with that, then at some point you're starting to be rewarded with a gift very rare in the movies these days. The story becomes alive. As if the language in which the film speaks, rather obscure before, becomes easily understandable. You still don't know anything, neither what happened nor what's about to happen, but you are already willing to play along, cross that barrier between yourself and the story, and unite with it with no questions asked. There's something magical about it.But the abstruse talk aside, Serenity really is a hell of a ride. And you don't even need to understand everything to have fun riding along. I believe the reason for that is how the crew members of Serenity interact with each other. There's hardly any other film where such diverse people really feel like a family. Every movie wants to have that, only a few actually do. And with Serenity, it's both gripping and entertaining. Almost like a sitcom filmed inside a spaceship. Cool mix, right?But the thing that finally buys you over completely is that Serenity never, never tries to be anything monumental. That's the biggest flaw of the space movies: they often try to seem larger than life, and because of that they do feel lifeless. Here, on the other hand, we have something that is built upon love. The whole relationship of the crew - they don't try selling love to us, but keep it to themselves as something to cherish.And that's exactly what makes Serenity easy to love. The otherwise unknown people whom, except Chiwetel Ejiofor, i hardly remember seeing anywhere else. But together, they make a team that even Millennium Falcon could've wished for, and with one of the most charismatic and solid captains the genre has ever had. Too bad they don't make movies like this anymore.",Serenity
137,kevin_crighton,Time to misbehave all over again!,10,19 June 2007,"Serenity was my favourite movie of 2005. I saw it so many times, I think the staff at my local cinema were giving more proof (if proof was needed!) of my movie geekiness. For the record, 10 times in around 4 weeks!! I've not watched the DVD of Serenity since I bought it. I think the reason was that I didn't want to find out I didn't like the movie so much anymore. Well, after finally watching it again, I'm more than happy to say it still remains one of my favourite movies.As most people will know, Serenity was the movie spin-off of the cancelled series Firefly. The show was cancelled before it was ever given a chance by it's network. But in the 15 episodes that were made, it showed all the hallmarks you expect from a Joss Whedon show: mainly interesting story lines, good characters, and some very funny dialogue. It's pleasing to note that all these elements made it to the movie version too.One of the best things about the movie, is how in the opening 10 minutes he's re-capped everything that all fans need to know, YET still done it in a way non-fans can get up to speed on the plot and characters. From something I'd read at the time, the plot of the movie about an Operative of the Alliance hunting down River and her brother in case she knows the Alliances' dark secret, was going to be covered in what would have been the second series of Firefly had it gone that far. This shows that Joss Whedon had really had high hopes for the show, and was determined to keep it going in some way.The actors reprising their roles from the series do very well. Summer Glau does very well as River, now having to reveal a different side of her character that was only hinted at in the episodes. The real star of the movie though is Nathan Fillion as Malcolm Reynolds. His performance dominates the movie, and the part allows for some humour for the character to show, yet he can also handle the action side very well. It was suggested by some critics that Mal shares some qualities with another famous space character - Han Solo. I'd have to agree with that. Hopefully with a bit of luck Fillion can become a big star after this and last years Slither, in the same way Harrison Ford became a big star after Star Wars.Special mention has to go to Chiwetel Ejiofor. His performance as the Operative is very impressive. He shows the characters loyal (if blind) devotion to the Alliance and total belief in what he is doing is right.Obviously for a movie some characters get a bit sidelined or have small roles in the proceedings, however each of the main characters get their little moments to shine even among all the action and explosions. It also means that when certain dark moments for the characters happen you are shocked and saddened by them. I'd heard that in some fan audiences, there were tears at certain moments. I can believe that.But the movie is Joss Whedon's show. He allows the familiarity of the actors and characters to shine through, allowing for humour in even the darkest moments. He handles the action scenes very well for a first time movie director and the special effects and CGI used are all very impressive.If this was the last hurrah for Firefly/Serenity then it goes out with it's head held high, and holding it's own on the big screen against the Star Wars/Star Trek crowds.It's taking me nearly 18 months to watch this again since buying it. I'm pleased that it still is one of my favourite movies. Next time I won't wait so long to re-visit it.",Serenity
138,Benjamin_Cox,How to flog a dead horse - 56%,5,24 August 2006,"I was only dimly aware of a little known sci-fi show called ""Firefly"", created by Joss ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" Whedon. Knowing nothing of how it was cancelled after just two series and the subsequent push by fans to have it reinstated, I was totally unaware that this, essentially, is the last hurrah for the cast and crew. Unfortunately, the flaws of the TV show are magnified on a bigger screen and a telling lack of budget and big-name actors do little to help.After humans have colonised the galaxy after Earth becomes uninhabitable, the totalitarian Alliance wage war on the Independent worlds and win. But once a powerful psychic (Summer Glau) is rescued from the Alliance by her brother (Sean Maher), concerns are raised that she may know too much and an assassin (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is sent to find and silence her. But they are travelling with former Independent war hero Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and his crew on the good ship ""Serenity"" who are caught in their own battle between themselves, the Alliance and the cannibalistic Reavers. Can they survive a conflict which threatens to engulf the galaxy?I'm sure, given the creative talents of Mr Whedon, that the TV show had much more depth to it than ""Serenity"" which came across as being light on content and imagination. It felt like sci-fi written by a fan instead of having the excitement and grandeur of ""Star Wars"" or the depth and passion of ""Star Trek"". The other problem is having the largely unknown cast recreate their roles for the movie but given the only actor I recognised was Alan Tudyk (and again, hardly a household name), the quality of the acting was somewhat suspect. There are some fleeting comic touches but these are few and far between, meaning that ""Serenity"" feels little more than a series of sci-fi action sequences.I'm not adverse to sci-fi films - as a genre, it's extremely varied from the crowd-pleasing excitement of ""Star Wars"" to intelligent and thought-provoking films such as ""Blade Runner"" and ""Minority Report"". But this just feels cheap filler, although doubtless fans of the series will lap this up and weep over what might have been. But personally, this really didn't involve or excite me at all and I couldn't escape the feeling that this could have been much better than it actually was. A wasted opportunity then but like I said, fans of ""Firefly"" will watch this over and over again. Whedon does need to realise that sci-fi fans are a tough crowd to please and getting a standing ovation at one comic convention doesn't mean that your recently cancelled show was any good - I'm willing to bet that most of them were ""Buffy"" or ""Angel"" fans anyway.",Serenity
139,Tehmeh,"Very intensive, character-driven film.",10,9 June 2006,"You know, I didn't see much of the Firefly show, but I liked what I saw. Especially the characters and the chemistry between them.The canceled TV show gets a movie? When has that happened before? Surely, firefly had small but very enthusiastic fan base. This may be small miracle.I liked what I saw in this one too. It did have enough ties to ""Firefly"", yet it worked for someone who's never seen the show too. The movie was very well paced, and the moods varied nicely. There was action, humor, more serious things, relationships, good stunts, good plot with some twists, excellent dialogue....you name it.What Whedon (director/writer) did for ""Serenity"" and ""Firefly"" - well, just check out the characters. Amazing job. The personalities really come through. The way they speak, move, frown, react to things - just great. You really like all of the main characters, even if you hate what they represent. They are just so exciting to watch. Also the dialogue is great, and not at all boring or predictable. The humor doesn't consist of annoying one-liners (or too many quips which plagued some later Whedon movies), but the situations and the characters themselves. Just seeing the characters talking to each other got me excited. How many times this happens in an action adventure movie? You can also notice the great chemistry between the actors which is a thing that gives the whole film a nice boost. Aspiring filmmakers would do well to watch this movie as an example of how to use characters in a fast-paced and quirky adventure. Dialogue and script do not cost a billion dollars.The actors did great. The chemistry is there, and they are clearly enjoying themselves all the time. The captain (Nathan Fillion) was of course my favorite - you just got to love him.The plot is overall pretty good. There are twists, some flashbacks, a couple of sub-plots - it's all here. Somewhat formulaic in a sense, but also creative and exciting. Every bit of the movie is great entertainment. This is not an art film, but it doesn't mean that it's not smart. It truly is.Although ""Serenity"" didn't have a billion dollar budget, it really made the most of its resources. The special effects were just fine. We see some smart FX work, because they had to make several creative choices to go around the budget, and the result is as good as it could have been. The special effects have character and charm to them, which is in line with the rest of the movie.""Serenity"" is a great ride, and it's very fun to watch. Lovable characters crown the cake. I think this is Joss Whedon's finest work, better than ""Avengers"", and probably one he can't top.",Serenity
140,bob-rutzel,Bad Movie,2,7 January 2006,"Space Captain Reynolds (Fillion) who pilots a crew that engages in bank robberies and other similar crimes agrees to protect River (Glau), a genetically superior warrior that the Alliance wants back.This used to be a TV show, FIREFLY, and was canceled in good time. This movie should have been canceled as well. I remember watching the TV show to see what it was about. That glimpse only took one viewing and I am not sure I saw the episode to the end. Then, people kept buying the DVD and some executive with more money than brains said, ""Hmmm, maybe we should make a movie of this."" The first problem was the idea to make the movie in the first place; the second problem with the movie is that everything happens too fast and I didn't have time to absorb anything. I didn't get a real good chance to get to know the characters. I didn't know who the good guys were. I mean, after all, this crew was robbing a bank when this opens. I am supposed to get on board with this? I was all for the Alliance when I learned that they kill people who disagreed with them. And, they seemed to take pleasure in it. What to do? What to do? Okay, I figure the bank robbing crew probably had a good reason to be crooks and so I sided with them. But I didn't like any of them. River, (the escapee from the Alliance eventually put on a fighting show that Bruce Lee would have been proud of) never really came through for me to sympathize with her. She was mute for most of the movie. Her protective brother did most of the talking and there was no information there. The rest of the crew acted like they were auditioning for the lead in a new Patton film and that got old fast. What to do? What to do? Well, the new Spiderman movie still wasn't out so I continued with this mess.I still say medals should be awarded for watching a bad movie to the end. I mean, a lot of people, behind the scenes, put their heart and soul into their work and that's unfortunate when the show bombs. The medals are for their benefit to show that I sympathize with them.The special effects were lame for the most part, nothing spectacular. The dialogue was okay in places and bad in others places. No T&A to keep hope alive. No betrayals to make things interesting. No real explanations of things that might have also kept hope alive. This movie assumes you know things about it and they dance around what is going on and you do have enough information to know what is going on, but something is still wrong. You are really not quite sure about what you hear.Can you imagine for a minute that people actually went out and bought the DVD from the TV show to record sales that told someone to make a movie out of this? It's hard for me to imagine. I guess the real problem, for me, is that I didn't like any of the characters and that's important. Seems the director forgot there was an audience out there. Yes, this is a bad movie and not bad in a good way.",Serenity

142,Barky44,Space Smackdown with Wooden Characters,7,6 October 2005,"Serenity is your average space-opera flick. Grizzled captain leading a gun-toting ragtag crew; a ""bucket of bolts"" ship doing ludicrous stunts; an enigmatic character holding the secrets of the universe; and a quest that can only be performed by these players.Serenity is fun enough to watch, and good enough for the teenaged set. But if you want more out of a film, you'll be disappointed.The problem is the characters and the performances behind them. It is really hard to actually care about the good guys, and it's only moderately easier to find the villains interesting. They really aren't much more than window dressing and a vehicle to throw out plot points to make the space battles more interesting. But it does have The Reavers, a particularly repugnant group of bad guys that make the whackos in Mad Max look like girl scouts.The other problem I have with this film is a problem that's affecting many space sagas, most notably the remake of Battlestar Galactica and the three Star Wars prequels. Directors have lost all sight on how to film space battle sequences. Close-up shots of space ships doing sudden banks; lots of herky-jerky camera motions; and too much cluttered nonsense on the screen actually steal away, not enhance, the excitement and tension of a good space battle. I really, really hate this whole trend and it must be stopped NOW. All sci-fi directors need to strap themselves in to their Barca-loungers and watch the original Star Wars series, paying special attention to the space battle sequences. That's how you film this stuff! But, alas, if George Lucas forgot, then what hope do these other directors have? I give this 7 out of 10. Points lost for wooden characters and annoying cinematography.Barky",Serenity
143,extravaluejotter,Wham-Bang Sci-Fi Adventure,8,26 December 2006,"Joss Whedon is truly a living god among us. He is too ridiculously talented and versatile to exist solely in this dimension. Unfortunately, this talent is sometimes ignored by The Suits, especially those at FOX who decided to cancel his slow-burning TV Sci-Fi series ""Firefly"". Much was made of Whedon's decision to base the series on post Civil War American history and the expansion of the Wild West. Basically, some people got it and some people didn't. In this case, the people who didn't get it were The Suits.As with Matt Groening and the ""Futurama"" debacle, Whedon became a victim of his previous success. The Suits didn't like it when Groening didn't give them a ""Simpsons"" clone and they were even less pleased when Whedon didn't come up with a near-exact copy of ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"". Fortunately for the fans of ""Firefly"" (and lovers of Sci-Fi adventure in general), Whedon put his money where his mouth was and made a stand-alone movie after the series was cancelled. This was a colossal gamble, but it seems to have paid off, judging by the IMDb rating for ""Serenity"".But that's enough background. Did I enjoy this movie? Yes. It's vintage Whedon, full of sympathetic characters (even the bad guy has some human moments) and smart dialogue. Whedon has a way of knitting a disparate group of people together as a team (see ""Buffy"", ""Angel"" and ""Alien Resurrection"" for previous examples) and the crew of ""Serenity"" are a sparky bunch to be sure. The plot paces itself nicely and it's fairly easy to pick up the back-stories of the main characters as you're swept along.The cast do a fine job. Nathan Fillion fills the screen as Mal Reynolds, making me wonder why he hasn't been offered more star roles. Chiwetel Ejiofor is a fine match for Fillion as the Alliance Operative, an implacable and ruthless villain. The rest of the original TV cast all act like they mean it, with Adam Baldwin standing out as the weapon-obsessed he-man Jayne. Baldwin almost steals every scene he's in, but he knows his craft and gives a fine supporting performance. Every time his character's name was mentioned I found myself smirking. Jayne is Johnny Cash's ""Boy Named Sue"" given access to an armoury and a multi-gym.A good human interest story married to a reasonable level of CGI effects and some bone-crunching action sequences, executed by a team that have a lot of faith in each other. Highly recommended.",Serenity
144,craig-hopton,Not bad,7,5 August 2014,"Not a bad SciFi movie. Fits into the 'space opera' category alongside movies like Star Wars, where a whole other universe is created complete with various planets, civilisations and quirky characters and spaceships.However this is certainly not the new Star Wars. The best praise I can give is that it's like an extended version of a Han Solo scene. It focuses on a renegade rag tag crew in a beaten up little craft called Serenity who are moseying their way around the galaxy trying to get by. They take a refugee on board who turns out to be on the Wanted list of the Alliance, the controlling civilisation of most of mankind.Sadly, unlike Star Wars the bad guys are singularly unmemorable. In the main they are represented by an Alliance 'Operative' played by Chiwetel Ejiofor who is regularly outwitted by the crew of Serenity. His sole skill seems to be his martial prowess but even then he beaten in hand to hand combat at the end. There are also bands of 'Reivers' to contend with who are even more pathetic - like B- movie zombies in space.Fortunately the plot itself is a good SciFi script, about an escaped Alliance assassin, her mysterious memories and dreams, and a dark secret about the Alliance that she will reveal. This character, 'River' played by Summer Glau easily steals the show. The only other performance worthy of note is that of Nathan Fillion who makes for a strong, ruthless yet good- hearted captain of the Serenity.An enjoyable viewing and the makers are to be commended for the breadth of their vision in creating an impressive universe to set the movie in.",Serenity

146,spacemonkey_fg,"Fun and intelligent, should be watched by more people",10,22 February 2006,"Title: Serenity (2005) Director: Joss Whedon Cast: Nathan Fillion, Summer Glau, Jewel Staite, Adam Baldwin Review: Joss Whedon is known to freaks and geeks around the world (myself included) as the creator of the two hit television series Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The series where incredibly huge hits the world over. So who would have thought that his next TV series called Firefly would be a complete and utter failure? As soon as it hit air waves it got canceled after just a few episodes. Well, Whedon didn't give up with the universe that he had created and decided to put all his efforts in making a film out of a failed television series, with no stars and a small budget. Sounds like a sure fire way to make a flop no? Guess again! This movie rocked!This movie takes place in a future in which the human race could no longer go on living on earth alone. Overpopulation got the best of humanity. So, once humanity discovers this whole other galaxy with planets suitable for human colonization they start populating those planets . At the same time, the government is working on creating a new race of warriors and they are experimenting on a girl called River Tam. Her brother decides to fly in with the help of a bounty hunter/thief called Mal and rescues her from the grasps of the evil government. Now the government wants River back because she has something hidden in her memory that can harm them. What is the secret? And just what is Rain truly capable of doing with her abilities? With all the bad omens that it had, I wasn't expecting this movie to be a big hit in theaters and I thought it would probably get ignored by the masses, which it was. First off, we get a good solid story. And this is one of Whedons gifts. The dude can write good funny dialog and he can come up with a kick ass story. There's no doubt about that! Heck, the guys has written a gazillion episodes of Buffy and Angel, all that experience in constructing an entertaining, interesting story has to count for something huh? And that experience shows. The story for Serenity will keep you interested every step of the way, revealing bit by bit its story at just the right pace. And a good story it has. Any smart viewer can make associations with todays world events and the story in this film. And I loved that. But its not just about making allegories to current events. The film mixes its interesting story with some truly kick ass action and likable characters.The characters in the film led by Capt. Mal are very layered and ambiguous. They are not cardboard cut outs. And I think its one of Joss Whedons abilities to write characters who are not entirely perfect. With Serenity we get Capt. Mal a thief/bounty hunter who used to be a soldier and ends up being the hero of the film. This character is funny, likable but has an edge to him. Liked him right away! Summer Glau the actress who plays River Tam -the girl who the government wants to recover- is a great character, and yet again as many of Joss Whedons characters, she has a dark side to her. Here I was thinking that this movie was just going to be an excuse to create another female hero ala Buffy but this film isn't like that at all. River has a dark side to her. The movie doesn't completely focus on her which is something that I was fearing. She part of a team. And the movie isn't only about her.The action sequences are fantastic! There's a sequence that involves a hovercraft, that really caught me off guard at how great it was. There's a battle sequence in space thats amazing as well the movie is filled with some really good extended action sequences. And the effects where a nice mixture of CGI and real props. In other words for the most part, the hover craft sequence looks solidly real! There's some cool fight sequences that also were very entertaining. I though, oh no, here we go again with some stupid ass fight ala the dumb fights we see on Buffy..not so! River has some kick ass moves that were so cool I had to instantly rewind to see what she had just done. Clap worthy fighting.The villains in this film are great as well. We get this government operative who is in charge of regaining River Tam for the government that is a calculating evil bastard! Then we get The Reavers which are this race of people who have gone crazy and violent. I loved those creatures, and its not necessarily because they are cool looking monsters or anything. Its more about this feeling of complete evil that they irradiate. They feel like a really true threat for our heroes. There was an element of horror to these characters which I loved. Speaking of which, since non of the cast is made up of famous actors or WB teens, well, you feel like any of them could bite it at any given moment. In all honesty I think this fact helped the movie immensely.Well, in conclusion, this movie surpassed my expectations. Joss Whedon, using all the training he had in creating both Buffy and Angel, has managed to make an entertaining, action packed, funny and thought provoking film. I honestly don't have anything bad to say about this film! Kudos to Whedon and I truly hope that this movies fan base grows with time and becomes a cult favorite, cause this movie didn't need to be ignored by everyone. It was actually good.Rating: 5 out of 5",Serenity
147,Paynebyname,I couldn't have asked for it to be any better.,10,10 October 2005,"Wow, what a truly fantastic film this. Granted I was a fan of the short lived Firefly TV series that it originated from and thus my opinion might be biased but I could still see where the casual observer would be able to pick it up and I can't recommend it highly enough.The SF genre has needed a good shot in the arm after the woeful new star wars trilogy and I'd say this surpasses them in almost every way. There is humour, sadness, great action set pieces and most importantly (though many Hollywood films forget this) excellent, well drawn characters and a cracking story.The characters are all well rounded to the point where you do feel for them and care for their progress through the adventures; they flirt with good and bad virtues so aren't just your basic cut out, stereotypical figures. Although its science fiction a lot of it is firmly grounded in reality and makes a lot of sense. Set 500 years in the future it shows (quite realistically in my opinion) how the in lying colonies are gleaming and shiny and more under the control of the alliance (universal government) whereas the outer lying colonies are more 'frontier like' in a style more akin to the Wild West. This doesn't slow the action down though and creates a believable universe but still with its share of space battles and space ships. There are many standout characters, numerous dramatic standoffs, plenty of great one liners and a magnetic, fabulous bad guy.A great story and adventure on its own and a marvellous addition to a genre that has recently lost its lustre.",Serenity

Several months after watching and enjoying the series, I came across the 2-DVD SERENITY pack.Yes, I thought it was a good SF movie although changes in the characters proved a little annoying. Killing off my favourite was likewise. But I could watch it again which I guess is the real test of a good movie.Strangely enough, the one character who doesn't work for me is Mal. He's somewhat reminiscent of Avon in the BBC classic TV series, BLAKE'S 7. But Mal lack's Avon's sense of humour and biting sarcasm. Blame it on the writing, not the actor.

Even after buying the series on DVD and re-watching the film, it just got better and better. Such great characters, story lines and direction for a film. Science fiction that is NOT about the effects? Give it to me any day.The humor in the story lines and character development is a standout feature. Laughing out loud at the antics of science fiction characters is what makes this all seem so *human*; it's not about the cyborgs or the laser beams in this one. The concept of the Old West in Space seemed weird at first, but you almost overlook it after awhile because it is so seamlessly presented.One of the highlights of the film is the acting, and the performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor really steals the show from the TV cast. Summer Glau is just amazing as River Tam and all that entails: her facial expressions are priceless as they tell her story even without words.One final note: the women in this movie, and indeed on the TV show, are all really, really attractive. That's a lot of eye candy for the male viewers, so enjoy it ...",Serenity

With that knowledge, the movie is a decent ending to a great show that was cut short. The movie follows the crew of the Firefly class transport ship named Serenity through a space-western adventure.It feels as though the movie took what was intended to be the ending of the Firefly series and condensed it into a movie format. This plot would have done so much better if it were stretched out over another season or two. For what it is, the movie blends fairly well into the Firefly series itself.However, if you have not watched the series, you will have a challenging time following and enjoying this movie.

153,1bilbo,Really great Sci fi - best in years,10,26 August 2006,"This is the best new Sci fi film I have seen in years and you don't need to have seen the Firefly series in order to get it.The main characters are actually quite dishonest  and the ship's captain is concerned about himself and his crew rather than saving the universe. The ship they fly in is a rot box that has seen better days  in fact; the film has a deal more reality than the average. Unlike a certain series in which there are 'throw away' junior crew members who are the only ones to ever suffer casualties, Serenity has a solid crew who work as a team  and suffer together.I found the acting, special effects and the settings to be totally convincing with an unusually sensitive musical soundtrack. Since purchasing the DVD I have bought the Firefly series and these are terrific.I rate this movie alongside the original Star Wars and The Wrath of Khan  it is a first class ""Must see"". 10/10",Serenity
154,frankenbenz,Bad TV comes to the big screen,2,2 February 2008,"I keep reading (from obvious Whedon fanboys) how sci-fi fans unfamiliar with Firefly will love Serenity. I'm a sci-fi fan, I've never watched Firefly and I hated Serenity. In addition to corny archetypes, a tired plot, unimaginative direction, incredibly lame fight scenes, painfully cute dialogue and CG worthy of Stargate Atlantis, this movie had nothing to offer aside from spending some time with Chiwetal Ejiofor. If you're not a Whedon fanboy this is a complete waste of time and offers nothing new to the sci-fi genre.I can't express how annoyed I am with having watched this film. I remember seeing the trailer in the theater and thinking how bad it looked. One thing that stuck in my mind about the trailer was the voice over spouting over and over: ""from the mind of Joss Whedon."" At the time I wondered if I was missing something since I had no idea who this great mind was. A few minutes on IMDb clued me in that Whedon was behind TV's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, a show I will admit I have never watched. Of course there was also the TV show Firefly, another show I had not only never watched, but had never heard of before (unfortunately) stumbling across Serenity. So now that I am well versed with Mr. Whedon's mind, I'm praying (something unfamiliar to an Infidel such as myself) Mr. Whedon (and his mind) will be relegated to penning schlock for the small screen, a medium where his lack of talent will undoubtedly float amidst a sea of feces.http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/",Serenity
155,DanLives1980,The outlaw crew of the Firefly make their final stand against the Alliance,10,6 April 2012,"There are more words to describe how awesome this film is than IMDb allows per review so I guess you'll just have to have the short version. Serenity is not just the film adaptation of one of Fox's greatest ever series, yet another one which was cancelled and never allowed back, it's also the end of everything that the show Firefly was ever meant to be.Joss Whedon, once creator of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer television show, is now such a respected creative force in film that his latest feature is none other than 'The Avengers!' How's that for a bit of ""in your face, Fox, you wet bag of poop""? Because Serenity is part film adaptation/part sequel to the series, I don't have to explain both to pitch this to you but what I will recommend is that you watch Firefly first. The boxset is as cheap as any new single DVD now and since the show was as well made as any modern film, it's much more rewarding to develop your love of the best characters ever thrown together before this film salutes them the most befitting farewell ever made.What would you get if you took the crew of the Millennium Falcon, took out all the silly Muppet-derived characters out and replaced them with characters out of a Wild West movie and had someone like comic book writer Garth Ennis writing the story? The crew of the Serenity are one of the most mixed up and conflicted bunch of people ever thrown into the same boat. Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his First Mate Zoe are war veterans on the losing side of the biggest battle in the universe, where the independents refused to bow down to the capitalist control of the corporate Alliance. They lost and now still refusing to bow down, they live as outlaws on the fringes of space, doing odd jobs to get by and their rag tag crew are along for the ride because other than not having lives elsewhere, they're now also the most wanted criminals in the universe.Housing two wanted runaways, a young doctor and his mentally disturbed sister who has been experimented on, they're now on the run from the Alliance's covert operative, not knowing that they're harbouring the only living test subject in a bid to create the universe's greatest weapon. But what they don't know is that she is the key to the darkest secret ever kept by the Alliance, which involves the existence of space's most feared creatures, the Reavers; a race of people gone mad on the edge of space who rape, murder and cannibalise everything in sight.Serenity manages to improve all you could ever love about Firefly and most of all, it ups the ante on everything you ever loved about the show while taking time to explain in almost geeky detail everything that remained untold after the show's cancellation. It's characters and actors are perfect in every way, old and new.Nathan Fillion (Saving Private Ryan, Two Guys, A Girl & A Pizza Place, Slither) as Mal applies every method in his inventory as an actor to make you root for him and the crew, to laugh, to cry and to literally rave at the screen as one of the greatest antiheroes in film and television history takes his fight to an army he could never defeat. He's not the brightest when it comes to relationships and understanding people and that's where his comedy is based but otherwise he's serious enough to give you goosebumps.Acting veteran Adam Baldwin (Full Metal Jacket, Independence Day, Chuck) brings back his uniquely insensitive bully Jayne Cobb with the kind of acting prowess that you don't find in most mainstream actors. His ability to make despicably horrible people hilarious and for people to like him for being a bastard is why he's a legend to those who know him.Alan Tudyk (Dodgeball, Tucker & Dale vs. Evil) as Wash, the unwitting, neurotic ace pilot gets to show off his acting abilities greatly in this adaptation, more so than in most episodes of the series but then again so does everybody else on board.With a crew of nine, five men and four women, Mal is the odd one out as the conflicted and lonely leader of the pack and Whedon's mastery of every character and how they interact, is his greatest gift. Thanks to his creative control and their real life friendships, they are all a bona fide crew and yet each a shining star in their individual rights.The art direction and overall graphic design of Serenity are flawless, sporting action on a massive, MASSIVE scale and still managing to keep the film firmly rooted in reality, which is almost an impossibility for today's CGI choked science fiction action adventures.This film is everything any film alike should resemble; intelligent, dramatic, hilarious, exciting, tragic and poetic. You will not see anything like it again maybe unless Whedon decides to make a sequel just for the sake of a family get together. Watch it as soon as you get the chance but please see the series first!",Serenity
156,liberalgems,What A Rotten And Sickeningly Violent Formula Film!,1,7 June 2007,"The applause from the movie audience was a lot louder before the film started than when it ended. Since this was opening night, packed with fans of the TV series, their lack of enthusiasm speaks a lot louder than words!I don't watch TV (gasp), so I haven't seen a single episode of the supposedly wonderful series. As a lover of sci-fi, my mind was wide open. What I saw was one of the most godforsaken, awful formula movies of my entire life. A modern day cowboys and Indians flick geared towards the mentality a 15-year-old boy with way too much time on his hands! In the world of Serenity the stakes are high because the guys in the black hats are gonna eat ya alive, quite literally, if they catch ya! Or, you could get lucky, and just get a sword rammed through ya by a self-professed psychopath who in the end conveniently sprouts a conscience. Or better yet, we get to see a 90 pound, 17-year old, morose female, kill a roomful of blood thirsty, and hungry, fellers with her bare hands. So make sure you don't get her cranky! This movie is so twisted, disgusting and campy, I can't decide if it should be categorized as a horror flick or an out-of-control comedy. But it was so bad, it wasn't funny!I'm also sick and tired of a rather dangerous message running through this film: Government is bad because it oppresses the poor, innocent, good guys. If only the those liberal meanies would leave us alone nothing bad would ever happen! Boo-Hoo! Yeah, right! This terribly misguided libertarian message of ""no government is the best government,"" simply does not hold water in the real world - as the citizens of New Orleans found out when Katrina struck! One final question: How do Living Dead-type zombies, who are unable to utter a single word, other than arrrrrrgh, pilot high-tech spaceships with ease? How do these zombies have the smarts to maintain these ships, and even go toe-to-toe in battle with the big, bad government? It seems in the world of Serenity being a blood thirsty, insane, speech impaired mutant is no obstacle to success!I hope I have discouraged you from spending your hard earned money on this really rotten piece of celluloid. But if I have failed, please do not let your children see this film. You'll thank me later! P.S. For those of you who continually fawn over this movie with cult-like adoration, I humbly suggest that you learn what REAL Science Fiction has to offer. It will take only one book to open narrow minds: ""Anatomy Of Wonder: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction,"" edited by Neil Barron. It should be required reading for all those lavishing praise on what is certainly one of the worst movies ever made!",Serenity

158,davek28,Disappointing,7,19 October 2005,"I watched the whole DVD set of Firefly a few months ago and was hoping that this movie would be an improvement in terms of scale and effects. Sadly, I was disappointed. Firefly (aka Serenity) is a TV series and should remain a TV series.The first hour was so slow and uninteresting that I nearly walked out. Fortunately, the second hour developed some excitement so I actually started to care what happened next.Knowing all the original characters, I was disappointed to see so little of Inara and Kaylee. In fact, the presence of Inara and Book seemed to be incidental and could have been left out altogether. I'd expect Zoe to be stoic when her hubby got his, but she was just impassive and apparently entirely unfeeling.Firefly made a nice space western on TV where you could serialise the crew and their relationships over time, but the big screen is far too big for it. Respect to Mr Whedon, but I think he has overstretched himself on this occasion. If there was any trademark snappy dialogue in there it got lost in the mêlée.",Serenity
159,rdvljunk,"oh, come on",2,22 April 2016,"It is now clear, ratings on IMDb and elsewhere can not be trusted. There is really now way, I mean absolutely no way, that a basic, plain, and very simple like this can score an 8 out of 10, other than trough manipulation. This movie lacks a story that has any value, the acting is poor, the dialogs are bad and sometimes pompous, there are many, many holes in the storyline, there is of course a hidden backup the bad guys did not find (ofcourse it is not easy to reach, unless you reached it and want to get back) the reavers go just whaaah to scare everybody. Come on people get serious. If you want a evening of meaningless mind-numbing entertainment I assume it is fine, but that doesn't make it a great movie",Serenity
160,brandon_lee420,They have done the world a favour!,10,19 May 2010,"The series Firefly was an intelligent Sci-Fi show that was original and brilliant at the same time. I was very angry at Fox for canceling the show because they stopped a series that would change human civilization for ever. Damn You FOXXX!!!! BUT my anger eased when I heard of the live action film called Serenity. Hearing about it was a miracle and seeing it was a blessing. Never before have I been so proud of Joss Whedon after watching this Science Fiction masterpiece that changed my life. I disagree with anyone who poses bad comments or rebellion against this. This movie truly deserves to be on IMDb 250 and I have no idea in the world why the staff members decided taht this was no longer a top 250 film. This film has the essence and soul of the FireFly series and if you take that and combine it with this film, you will be amazed, even better, BLOWN AWAY. The film introduces new deadly characters like the assassin called The Operative, but apart from new characters they also tell you lot more about the mysterious race called the Reavers, barbaric soulless monsters who rape their victors for ""hours without end"", and once they kill their enemies they skin them. That is utterly disgusting and also fascinating in a sick, weird sense of way. That is my humor at work....I guess. The Operative is a deadly and smooth assassin who has a sense of ""belief"", killing his objectives, and creating a world with no sin. He has a lot of awesome moves and is impressive in result. Chiwetel Ejiofor truly was a surprise at playing him because to me he seems like someone who belongs to the genre ""Drama"". Ejiofor is someone you have to look out for but be sure to stand away. The crew is back even more funnier, smarter, more heroic and slick than they could ever be. We see Nathan Fillion taking on the captain of the ship serenity, Mal Reynolds, and he still shines like a star. Adam Baldwin is still back with his brawn and humor as Jayne. He did an impressive job. Gina Torres is not up to her full potential and lacks the experience of what she did in the series. Her toughness became a weak point to her at the end of the film. To say what it is will be classified as a a spoiler. Alan Tudyk is as brilliant as ever for portraying Wash, the ships pilot. Morena Baccarin was a bit of a nuisance for me, no reason specified. Jewel Staite was, surprisingly, fun to watch as she, for the first time in her life, shot a gun....at the Reavers. She is valuable to the film. Sean Maher returns as Simon, a magnificent medical doctor who, obviously, seems the only one mature enough on the ship. He isn't the weak and vulnerable doctor anymore. He would surely kick Dr. Hannibal Lecter's A*S. The biggest surprise of the whole cast was Summer Glau for her can't-begin-to-describe acting. Her fighting talents are put to use in this film and she is even more deadlier than The Operative. I consider her as the best performer in the whole film. The Shepherd returns back but has a small part in the film. First of all, I want to say is that the actions scenes are spectacular and breath taking. Never before have I seen such brilliant fighting choreography from any choreographist before. Near the end, This film truly reaches its potential. The visual effects have improved a bit and a lot more detail has been put into the film. I would have loved to see some more floating islands though.In the future, when a passenger with a deadly secret. Six rebels on the run. An assassin in pursuit. When the renegade crew of Serenity agrees to hide a fugitive on their ship, they find themselves in an awesome action-packed battle between the relentless military might of a totalitarian regime who will destroy anything - or anyone - to get the girl back and the bloodthirsty creatures who roam the uncharted areas of space. But, the greatest danger of all may be on their ship. From the mind of Joss Whedon, comes a new edge-of-your-seat adventure loaded with explosive battles, gripping special effects and fantastic new worlds.The most disappointing thing about this motion picture is that it left out that legendary song that was played in every episode of FireFLy. I was expecting to see that one last time. The story is clever and exhilarating. Two hours is not enough for a film like this but with a director like Joss Whedon, miracles can happen. I was happy that the film let in a bit more on The Ravers. Firefly didn't tell us anything about them but, thankfully, this film corrected that mistake. The race is even more barbaric than I imagined. And in relation to the Reavers, the costume designers and makeup artists have done a perfect job in making the reavers and the characters presentable. An award should go to them. My favorite scenes were when you first see the operative in action and his samurai-way-of-dying stunt. The other has to be (very minor spoiler) is when River single handily kills an army of reavers in a small area. I loved that scene! (end of minor spoiler). My least favorite part has to be (biggest spoiler ever!!!) when Wash dies by being pierced through the heart. (End of biggest spoiler ever). One thing everyone should know is that before you watch Serenity make sure that you have watched the season Firefly first. You will get to know a lot more about the crew and the story will become much more clearer. Trust me on this. The film does an excellent job of having one or two, maybe zilch, stereotypes and even if it did, it did a good job of hiding it. Recommended to science fiction fans!",Serenity
161,SeminolePhenom,The Sci-Fi movie that perfects what prior Sci-Fi's have lacked for the last 10 years!,9,3 October 2005,"Mal(Nathan Fillion) is the captain of ""serenity"", a transport ship that harbors a crew willing take any job for decent pay. But after picking up a fugitive doctor and his psychotic sister, the crew is caught up in something much deeper than they could have ever imagined as they deal with a deadly assassin tailing them and the seventeen year old girl aboard Serenity, who just so happens to be a human weapon.I have never seen a single episode of Firefly and I found Serenity to be by far the best Sci-Fi movie I have seen since 1999 with The Matrix. It is an artistic, thrilling, sci-fi comedy that can be closely related with only one, Star Wars. It not only has the potential to be as good as the original Star Wars, but could also bring forth a much larger meaning to Sci-Fi that most Sci-Fi movies have lacked for so long.One thing I noticed more than anything was that symbolism and allusions was spread throughout the movie. Camera angles and lighting were frequently being used to set biblical references throughout the movie. In one scene, River(The psychotic sister who was being used as a weapon) was looking at damage done to a village through a flaming swing set showing what to me seemed to be the death of innocence. It was beautifully done and was something that would have been expected from an epic, high-budget film.The idea of a society without sin was the subject throughout the movie, which is a pretty deep topic for the type of movie to being with, but the movie adapted it to a situation in which it was original as well as greatly artistic with meaningful ideas behind the plot. The film's mythological caliber helped preserve its basic concepts and make the single greatest theme stay exceptionally large and noticeable: Free will is needed for humans to exist.I was immensely surprised that the director was the same man who did the Buffy the Vampire Slayer series and I was greatly impressed as well as shocked with his talented work done in this movie. Joss Whedon(the director) will have a great career ahead of him if he keeps creating movies of this caliber.Overall, I found the movie to be not only very well done but I also found it to be greatly artistic. Serenity is a thrilling adventure with a much larger meaning and could very well become a new classic. The only aspect of the movie that I disliked were a few excessively cheesy scenes that seemed to have little or no reason or meaning to the plot or character development in the movie. Besides these scenes, I found the movie to be quite flawless and massively entertaining.I highly recommend this movie.",Serenity
162,ciscokid1970,Brilliant movie for a great show,10,12 September 2006,"This movie was great for so many reasons. First of all it had a new take on sci fi movies. This one combines science fiction with a western. For its fresh perspective alone it would be great. But what makes this even better is the cast of characters and the actors who portray them.The captain is a battle hardened and experienced leader yet he maintains a clever sarcastic wit. They have a female mechanic and female bodyguard that break the stereotype trend. And of course the little sister that is actually a secret weapon.This show was good on its own. It was even better if you were a fan of the Firefly TV series. You can rent or buy the series on DVD now.The only complaint I have is that they could have spent a little more time developing the characters, of course that would have made the movie longer.Still this is a great movie with a fresh idea.",Serenity
163,blackburnj-1,Good Old Fashioned Sci-Fi Fun,8,16 October 2005,"Many have been disappointed, to say the least, by George Lucas' later efforts in his Star Wars saga. Many have complained that it lacked the vitality that the earlier films had and many are waiting for a sci-fi film with the spirit and imagination of those early films. For those people, the wait is over.Although I personally enjoyed the new Star Wars films to an extent, I have to agree that they lacked the humour and soul of the originals. But Serenity, written and directed by Joss Whedon, has rediscovered these stray attributes. The plot is a little confusing but it has the lovable rogue, the ""evil"" totalitarian administration, the secret that has to be revealed and many other parts of the classic swashbuckling sci-fi films of the seventies and eighties.The film is a wonderful comic adventure through the space of some distant future where an Alliance of Planets rules. In an attempt to hide a dark secret which they fear has been discovered by the psychic River (Summer Glau), the Alliance dispatches ""The Operative"", played wonderfully well by Chiwetel Ejiofor, to track River down and kill her. However, before he gets to her, Mal (Nathan Fillion), captain of the Serenity, does and she ends up leading Mal and his crew across the reaches of space in a search for ""Miranda"". Whilst doing this Mal and his crew must avoid the Reavers, vicious space savages. It is, in short, swashbuckling, action adventure, fun.Joss Whedon's script is entertaining and fun and his direction is tight and slick with some very awe-inspiring moments. The film is shot well, sounds great and has some spectacular special effects. But the film's major achievements are that it has inspired me to find out about ""Firefly"", the TV series which this is based on and that, from a failed TV series, Serenity has managed to convince Studio execs. to invest in a truly original film.Immense fun and highly enjoyable, Serenity is one of the Winter of 2005's must sees.",Serenity
164,MovieZoo,This review is better than the movie,5,1 October 2005,"I think I am being fair by saying this movie was made only for fans of the canceled TV show, Firefly. Not that there is anything wrong with that as long as you are a fan of the canceled TV show. The character, Mal, is not another Hans Solo as so many fans would like to believe. There is only a slight resemblance. Besides, it doesn't matter. He is lacking in character as much as the movie is. The biggest problem this movie has is it doesn't even seem any consideration was given to the ""newbie"".If you don't blink you will see bits of Everquest, Blade Runner, Star Wars and BattleStar Galactica. If you are lucky, you will blink between those bits of ""copycat"" sci-fi.I am happy for the fans of the TV show. I know the feeling of deprival when Star Trek was removed from TV and the satisfaction of the movie finally coming out. You deserve to have your moment but I hope you ask for more when and if they decide to make Serenity 2.The best part of the movie was the young ""River"". She was beautiful and fun to watch. And then there was Ron Glass! Man, where has he been? I have good memories of Ron Glass and wish they had more for him.Don't worry, George Lucas, your final episode was better than Serenity(Only slightly). Matter of fact, I hear Serenity fans mortified and screaming, ""No-o-o-o-o-o-o"".",Serenity
165,mungflesh,"Average, at best",5,10 January 2007,"Shocked to see this gets an 8/10 average.It had some great use of cgi s/fx but failed to mask the low-ish budget by (firstly) the relatively unknown cast (in fairness, the performances are strong) and (mainly) the drawn-out, weakly scripted, dialogue-driven sections which supposedly push the story on but in my opinion just dragged.The main issue is that the girl who is central to the plot does not seem to be involved in the resolution of the film's story. I didn't get it.The Reavers showed plenty of potential at the start of the movie but were simply referenced as being a threat and rarely proved frightening.6/10 is generous and comparisons with Star Wars are unworthy. Even The Phantom Menace had more in it to keep me interested.",Serenity
166,Ky-D,Near perfect Sci-Fi adventure.,9,5 March 2006,"Existing as something of an oddity, ""Serenity"" is at once a quality stand alone piece and a swan song for a tragic lost TV show. Having not seen the series ""Fire Fly"" when I first saw this movie I still found it wholly engrossing, then going back and watching the show made it all the more entertaining.In the future, after the fall of earth to pollution and decay, the human race flees to the reaches of space to propagate the species. The world cultures have combined into one super-culture headed primarily by the USA and China. Most groups yielded to the Alliance government, a collective of the upper-class and pseudo-fascist ideology, however some groups rebelled and were termed the brown coats. After the rebels were defeated at the Battle of Serenity Valley, the war was ended and those that lost were cast to the winds of fate. This is were the story begins with the crew of Serenity, a firefly class spaceship, hoping around the galaxy in search of work, both legal and not. After one seemingly random job, they find themselves inexorably tied to a galactic conspiracy that may finally give them a chance to make a difference.Before I start lumping on the praise I might as well get the faults out of the way. Some of the sets look a little 'made for TV', ie not very believable. Also, at a couple of moments the story feels a little rushed. And finally the film gets a just a touch too serious as it approaches the conclusion.Now, where to begin? The plot, story, writing, acting, CG, action scenes, all are expertly constructed. First the writing; on top of the deep back story and emotive plot lines, the script allows for some of the most likable and believable characters in all of Sci-Fi lore. It is nay impossible to pick any one character that stands out, they are all important and equally good. Were that not enough, it also contains razor-sharp dialogue that drives the film and it's conflicts, both in terms of drama and levity.Beyond the script the film holds up equally well. The Joss Whedon's direction is confident and clear, always moving toward a predetermined idea of any given scene. Assisting him is a cast of extremely talented yet mostly unknown actors, each of which takes their respective roles and defines them. Set construction, costume designers and CG artists round out the physical package.Special mention should be made for the CG artists, who with only a fraction of the budget of a ""Star Wars"" film have managed to put on one of the most exciting space battles in all of Sci-Fi.The only part of the film I would say is in any way hurtful would be that it is over. Not in the sense that it ended, but that there is not likely to be more. After the excellent series was canceled the film came along to wrap up those nasty loose ends. Now that it has come and gone, who's to say if there will be any thing left? Hopefully, there is.9/10",Serenity
167,no-skyline,Fun & Adventure In The Last Chance Saloon,8,8 February 2006,"Serenity is a spin off from the much loved early cancelled Joss Whedon (Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel) TV show Firefly, the movie a last chance to fly. But don't let the fact that it's a TV spin off put you off going to see it as it stands alone as colourful blast of summer blockbuster.Fun and adventure is the order of the day as far as Serenity is concerned with plenty of light hearted banter between action scenes and the snappy dialogue we've come to expect from Joss Whedon. I was never a fan of Buffy but Firefly really hit home with me and the reason is the characters who are all unique fully formed people rather than the cardboard cut outs that have ruined many recent Sci-Fi efforts (I Robot, Paycheck etc.) Nathan Fillion is excellent as Mal Reynolds and surely will now have mainstream success elsewhere as the natural successor to Harrison Ford. My favourite though has to be Alyn Tudyk as the irrepressible Wash, providing much of the comic relief without ever being irritating.Although there is a sadness in some plot points of the film you leave the cinema feeling uplifted just like you do from all the old style summer blockbusters. In a summer of dark supper hero's and the bleakest Star Wars since Empire... Serenity really brought a bright light to the blockbuster party its a shame more people didn't see it.As a note it's a shame there seems to be an ongoing debate Serenity or Star Wars raging all the time on IMDb. Was Serenity better than Revenge of the Sith? Who cares they were both great see them both.9/10 - A real sugar rush of adventure.",Serenity
168,phiggins,"Awesome, actually",9,12 October 2005,"As someone who has never seen any of Wheedon's earlier entertainments, I had no particular expectations of this movie. Imagine my surprise, therefore, when I ended up seeing one of the most entertaining, balls to the wall, pedal to the metal science fiction adventures in living memory. Make no mistake, people, this is top-flight entertainment that will live on for many years and be required viewing among those who care about such things at all (and this should include you). Serenity is packed with action, more-than-adequate effects, imagination, wit, verve, style, gorgeous women, sassy dialogue, and non-stop momentum. It lasts for two hours. It feels like ten minutes. Most importantly of all, you care about the characters. You believe in them. You root for them. You are mildly upset when some of them don't make it to the end. This is no pompous, soul-less St*r W*rs ""epic"" with as much genuine depth as a puddle. No, this is quality film-making, relying on character and imagination and fun and suspense rather than billion-dollar effects-sprees and green-screen emptiness.

169,DrTuvok,Cry havoc and let loose the trolls of war!,4,24 April 2020,"Okay, a lot of geeks adore this movie and its series but I found it to be just a bit overrated. I haven't seen the TV series which might account for why I didn't really care about the characters, but a movie should still be able to stand more or less by itself. It has the overall feel of an extended TV episode, with competent-but-bland direction, the rote, in medias res story which doesn't seem to have as big a scope as Joss thinks, and the tone-setting opening credits that appear TV style over a scene of the characters going around their ship. I didn't think the acting was particularly good either, but the dialogue was breezy enough. The action scenes were, once again, quite blandly directed (even though the ships with lassos were interesting), but they still felt like outtakes of an old Star Trek movie. The zombies were dumb.I kind of have an idea of what Joss the director was doing here, he wanted to make his own Star Wars but needed something *different* from SW so he took 'space western' to a whole new level and added in a bunch of Chinese swearing for world-building. It could have worked, maybe, but the result in this movie felt forced and somewhat clumsy, with Joss still maneuvering his way out of TV directing status. Maybe he needed a better grasp on storytelling.",Serenity
170,leilapostgrad,Austin Movie Show review,6,10 October 2005,"Apparently there was once a TV show called Firefly, created by the same guy who created Buffy The Vampire Slayer and its spin-off, Angel. This writer's name was Joss Whedon, and he was very successful at writing TV shows that lots of people liked to watch.But not enough people watched Firefly, so it was canceled. But it had such a cult following, that Whedon wrote a feature-length film adaptation of the TV show and called it Serenity. Here's the irony  in 1992, Whedon wrote a script for a movie called Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Not a whole lot of people went to the theater to watch it. Then he wrote a script for a TV pilot by the same name, and it became one of the most popular TV shows of the 90s. Weird.So there's your background info. As for the movie itself, it's okay. Having never seen the TV show that it's based on, all I can say is that Serenity is like a really well written 2-part episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Set four hundred years in the future, humans have settled a brand new solar system, with half the planets joining an ""Alliance,"" and the other half wishing to remain autonomous. Thus began ""the war."" The characters are all pretty likable, and Whedon is pretty good at writing smart science fiction with funny dialog at the same time. If you liked the TV show, you'll love the movie, and if you've never even heard of Firefly, I think you'll have a good time at Serenity.",Serenity
171,Alcaminhante,I'm glad the original series was canceled...because...,10,10 October 2005,"...otherwise i can bet everybody here, that we wouldn't have had this amazing movie at the theaters right now yet.Everything i wanted to see in the new Star Wars movies is here in Serenity. It even has a better ""Han-Solo"" character than in the Star Wars original sequels !! Everything i loved in the Han-Solo concept as a kid when i first saw the original Star Wars, is present here and in the TV series Firefly. Not only that concept of a space mercenary was totally well developed and updated in the Firelfy TV series, it came with a whole new and original universe attached. One i hadn't seen yet anywhere before and that is far more appealing than the carpeted future from the overly politically correct Star Trek universe for example. The Firefly universe feels real, there's not many difference between heroes and villains, there's just people flying around the solar systems like if they were colonizing some distant part of the earth.Classic Space-Opera is back, and it doesn't need a Star Wars tag attached on it to be a success which is something i'm very glad to see, as i thought that i would never be seeing a decent space-opera coming out of Hollywood for many years. For two decades it seemed that audiences only thought that Star Wars was it, that there was nothing more or superior to create in the Space-Opera genre where Hollywood was concerned. I'm not only glad that something like Firefly and now SERENITY appeared because, not only managed to create a whole new universe in the Space-Opera style, but it did that without using well known movie stars ! I can't even believe that someone in Hollywood produced this movie without Mel Gibson or Brad Pitt in it ! SERENITY keeping its purity from the original TV Series it's a real miracle. The characters are all amazing and i would be very disappointed if someone had picked new actors to play them instead of this amazing bunch of people who live in this characters so well.I loved the movie and i'm going back to see it a couple more times yet. But although i loved the film, there were a couple of things i was disappointed with. For example , i didn't felt the Western style as much as it's present in the TV series. One thing i love in the series is the lighting inside Serenity, where the interior of the spaceship feels warm and cozy with all that brown, pastel and yellow. In the movie most of the interior of the ship was lighted with a cold blue light which for me spoiled a bit of the atmosphere i was hoping to find. There are a couple more details that disappointed me, but they were not enough to spoil the joy of seeing the best Space-Opera movie since the original Star Wars appeared.SERENITY not only completes the unfinished series but also has plenty of material to start a new one. So please...someone...bring back FIREFLY and then more SERENITY sequels please. Although...few dramatic surprises regarding some of the characters, make me wonder, how will Joss Whendam now bring the original crew back for a sequel...although i can think of a couple of ways...;)If you love space-operas in books, if you were disappointed with the new Star Wars movies and want to see something new and refreshing , you can't go wrong with SERENITY. 10 out of 10. In fact...eleven out of ten. Ten is just for the people who don't know the series.I want more !",Serenity
172,cdelacroix1,Edgy Humorous Action-Packed Sci-Fi Ride,7,1 October 2005,"I just saw this movie and thought it was wonderful. I never saw the original Firefly series on which this is said to be based but now think I might want to go back and see if I can track it down.I think what I myself liked most about this movie was the excellent balance of sci-fi special effects with the human experiences of the characters. That's just plain not an easy balance to make, as far as I can see, but this movie made it. The special effects and cinematography were superb but never, ever overwhelmed the Story and Characterizations.Think of sort of an edgier Star Wars, with strong flavoring from the Matrix, a Xena Warrior Princess manque (and not so manque), and a bunch of blood-thirsty zombies thrown in for good measure, you'll have an approximation of this movie.The acting was competent, the dialog was top-notch, the humor always on cue, the action was non-stop, and the sheer sense of fun ever-present.Wonderful flick to say the least. Check it out.",Serenity
173,das417,"One of the best movies of this year, Serenity will blow you away",9,3 October 2005,"I am not one to overstate my case. What I say for the most part is what I believe. Especially when it comes to movies. Therefore, when I say that Serenity is one of the better movies of this year, I am not saying this just to say it.I confess that I came to the Serenity scene rather late. I remember the series several years back and finding it rather dull. However, since I have started watching the reruns, I was able to find enough justification to watch the movie. And its a good thing because what few episodes I watched gave me enough background information to enjoy the movie. (In fact, I may not have even watched the movie if it wasn't for the episodes I watched).That being said, on to Serenity. For the most part, it picks up where the series left off. Serenity finds itself in the typical situation. Desperate to complete a job, Mal leads his fearless crew on a daring raid to rob Alliance financial holdings. The Alliance has grown stronger and it seems jobs are harder to come by. Thus, the certain urgency to complete this task.However it is River, played by the lovely Summer Glua, who is the main concern for Serenity. Plagued by constant nightmares she cannot understand, it becomes obvious that something more is driving her once she literally beats up nearly thirty people AND threatens Mal's life. It is during this 'mania' that Mal (played by Nathan Fillion) and the others discover that she knows the location of a seemingly almost forgotten world. Whatever is driving her, and the answers as to why the Alliance is after her, can be found there.To make matters worse, the Alliance has sent a mysterious agent (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor) to hunt River down at all costs. It is apparent that life means little to him and will deal with anyone who gets in his way or who he sees as aiding River.Throughout the movie we are treated to a steady series of events which only add to the suspense. We learn more about what has taken place in the lives of such character as Inara (Morena Baccarin) and Shepherd Book (Ron Glass). While the romantic conflict between Mal and Inara is only intensified, and watched upon with humor by the rest of the crew, it also happens to be one of the more lacking aspects of it. Though it is obvious the two have feelings for each, its almost like watching two kids who don't know how to express their feelings. But it does add to more of the tension so it is forgivable.As it turns out, River is the sole survivor of a world in which the Alliance tried an experimental gas agent on its knowing population. In the process, it made most so docile that many just died from lack of the most basic human needs such as feeding. An entire world perishing due to the 'evil' plans of the Alliance to create 'a world without sin'.However, there was another side effect in the Reavers. A cannibalistic race that preys on the most defenseless. And, it is in this race where Serenity finds some of its best plot. The uncovering of the mystery of River and the Reavers is what drives Serenity and once uncovered it manages to give a satisfactory conclusion.The deaths of several major characters was one of the most interesting plot developments of Serenity. Wash (Alan Tudyk) and Preacher were two of the most easily likable characters and crew of Serenity. Their deaths makes me ask what direction Serenity, if continued, will take. However, it was a good decision and it added more to Serenity by making it more the just a 'bigger episode'. I am not a Josh Whedon fanatic like many others. I find Buffy and Angel silly, boring and more soap operas then anything else. However, he has struck a cord with Serenity. 9 out of 10",Serenity
174,Movieguy_blogs_com,It is like the Old West meets Star Wars.,10,31 August 2005,"Serenity is based on the very short-lived TV series Firefly. So short-lived that the final episodes from the first and only season are only available on DVD.I don't know why the TV show was not a success. The movie is awesome. It is like the Old West meets Star Wars. Capt. Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) plays a pseudo Robin Hood and leads a band of 'space cowboys'. Mostly comprised of former soldiers, Serenity's (the ship's) crew fought the Alliance for the outer-rim planets during the war. A war they lost. Now, this crew robs the Alliance government at times to keep their ship running, but mostly to stay free. But when they uncover a very dark secret of the Alliance, they have something new to fight for.I never saw the original show, but this movie makes me want to go buy the DVDs. It has a lot of action and, from fans of the show, it holds up well with the series. I think most fans are really going to love this movie.",Serenity
175,ElessarAndurilS,Great series ending!,10,20 January 2016,"Given the short run of Firefly it was nice to have a movie to bring some closure to the beloved series. Having to lose some characters in the process was not fun, but I thought the movie did a good job of bringing a plausible end to the story with our cast coming out with a big win against the alliance by exposing the horrible history of the source of the cannibals roaming the edge of the solar system. Gave us a good winning (small win, not big) against evil and the crew escaping impossible odds. Still am not quite certain how the tortured work on River resulted in a teenager who could wipe out an army alone that a fleet of military couldn't, but hey, sometimes you just take the extremes to allow the path to lead to the ending desired. Personally I loved the Movie and am glad they made it with a satisfying end to the short story of our band of ""hero's"". Not sure they were truly hero's but I was always pulling for them and if the show had run longer most of what the movie did I expected the show would have gotten to. Good job of putting a bow on a show that should have run much longer.",Serenity
176,SSJAniFan,Takes everything good about the TV show and stomps on it.,1,7 April 2006,"While not everyone may have heard of the television series Firefly, most who have actually feel that it was pretty darn good. The series featured a group of outlaws on a spaceship called Serenity, doing their best just to survive, in a show that blended sci-fi space with Wild West settings and themes. The strong cast didn't hurt either, and each character wound up playing an important role in the series, so much that in contrast to most shows where there was at least one main character you'd wind up loathing, each and every one was likable. Unfortunately, FOX never gave it the chance it deserved, first by airing the series completely out of the intended order, and then by canceling it only three months afterward. The series getting a theatrical movie seemed like a perfect opportunity to get a second chance.The only problem is, the film messes with EVERYTHING that made Firefly great. The Western theme is forgotten within the first few minutes, and becomes moreso straight up sci-fi than anything else. Two of the beloved characters are killed for no good reason, the first in a role that isn't much other than to be killed, the second done off in what seems like an afterthought. Other than Mal and River, who now suddenly knows kung-fu I might add, none of the characters none of the characters get that much focus or screen time either. The plot winds up becoming completely ridiculous compared to Firefly's somewhat more believability. It also winds up shifting villains, from an embarrassing, would-be, sword swinging ""super ninja"" called the Operative, to the menacing, flesh-eating Reavers that we've always heard of in the TV series, and who we now finally get to see... but for some reason look like outcasts from an 80's biker gang.The film can't even keep its continuity straight. For example, late in the film, River battles the Reavers. They overpower her and drag her off, presumably to be tortured and killed. Oh no! It seems that she's done for! It instantly cuts to Mal fighting said embarrassing would-be super ninja, then cuts back to River... who is now smacking Reavers about back and forth with no explanation whatsoever as to how she escaped. Now that is poor. C'mon Joss, you can do better than is. Is it really so hard just to say, add a minute of footage that shows River escaping? Firefly deserved so much better than this.",Serenity
177,tstudstrup,Complete nonsense,1,14 September 2018,"This is one of those movies made to finish the story of a cancelled tv-show. That show was called Firefly and it couldnt have been very good, since there was only 14 episodes.If you, like me, havent seen the show, the movie wont make much sense. From what I get though, it's about an annoying crew on a spaceship in the future. They pick up some annoying psychic or weapon or whatever the hell she is and her equally annoying brother who has freed her from captivity. The weapon is played wooden by the always ugly unattractive Summer Glau. And her brother is just an annoying prettyboy with zero personality. The crew all look like comicbook characters and theyre almost all of them, played ineptly by terrible actors. The only one acting above soap opera level is the always intense Adam Baldwin. Morena Baccarin will never be more than a beautiful face with a great set of boobs. Once she looses that, she wont be getting anymore work. The movie itself feels like a tv-movie even though it was in theaters. The action and special effects are decent, but nothing more than that.",Serenity
178,fred-287,Now I can be mad at Fox all over again....,10,26 October 2005,"After I first saw this a few weeks ago, I wasn't going to do a review, mostly because some others that I read seemed to express it's qualities pretty well. But now that I've seen it three times, I figure I ought to ""go on record."" What I chiefly want to plug is the underlying theme rejecting the notion of a ""better world,"" a ""world without sin."" Every governmental tyranny on record has had some ""good intentions"" among the skeletons in it's closet; now we have an Administration that ostensibly wants to convert the whole world to our way of life, at gunpoint if necessary. It doesn't require a ton of imagination to project this attitude into the future. I'd be tickled to learn that the Operative is a descendant of Condoleeza Rice (after whom an oil tanker was once named, then re-named after she became well known), Bush's fellow Christian and current Secretary of Scolding Other Countries.Of course it helps your appreciation of ""Serenity"" if previously you were a fan of Joss Whedon's lamentably short-lived ""Firefly"" (more on that below) and before that of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel."" Those shows will have prepared you for Mr. Whedon's genius in assembling a sparkling ensemble cast, extracting from each of them his or her best work (go back and watch all those movies Adam Baldwin was in--who knew he has such a flair for comedy?), creating a fresh perspective on vampires or Westerns, writing such witty dialogue (how many screenwriters create their own jargon?), directing so fluidly and tweaking viewer expectations without disrupting the premise, e.g. Mal telling Zoe ""Now if something happens, I want you to take the ship and.... come and rescue me.""Now to my real point: the Fox corporation can ""kiss my ass from now on,"" to borrow a Belushi line in ""Animal House."" I won't even delve into their right-wing political agenda that seeps into their fictional programming (that last season of ""24"" had the most justifications for torture being expressed by a character since ""Battle of Algiers"" forty years ago). I just want to focus on their complete and shameful transformation from nurturer of innovation to run-of-the-mill ratings whore. ""The Simpsons"" wouldn't last three weeks if it were a new show on Fox nowadays. It probably wouldn't have lasted three weeks back in the late Eighties if Fox hadn't been so desperate for viewers. Once Fox got comfy, though, once they had those Big Sports locked up--plus NASCAR, although I'm not sure if driving cars in a circle really fast qualifies as a sport---well then, sure they'd put interesting stuff on so they could make the announcement, then they'd yank it just as fast if it wasn't an immediate smash. I'll only mention the two shows I still miss the most, those of John Leguizamo and George Carlin. (I'd be happy to pay for cable TV just to see the specials from those guys.) When ""Firefly"" was on a few years ago, I was so sure that Fox would yank it too that I was reluctant to let myself get attached to it, but like a fool I did so, then of course right on cue, it was ""outta here."" It's nice that ""Firefly"" episodes are now available on DVD; it'd be even nicer if Fox could be prevented from getting any of the lucre.To finish with just a brief (but loving) quibble about the Reavers: these guys're so rabidly crazy that it's hard to envision how they spend their time when they're not actually attacking people. They're like old movie monsters who only need to exist so they can be in scary scenes. They must need major tranquilizers to get to sleep.How can one not love a movie where the guy piloting the spaceship has little toy dinosaurs surrounding him? I'll miss that character if there's a sequel, but that's part of Whedon's genius, knowing when to inject that sudden note of realistic tragedy; can anyone who saw Willow's girlfriend get killed on ""Buffy"" tell me it wasn't like a slap in the face?",Serenity
179,LilyDaleLady,I won the bet: now pay up!,3,10 October 2005,"A couple weeks before ""Serenity"" opened wide, there was intense discussion on this board about how successful the film would be. I said it would run a couple of weeks, do modest business...then disappear only to be released as a nice DVD gift set for Xmas. I was immediately attacked by fangeeks who were almost hysterical in their insistence that this modestly budgeted film would be a blockbuster hit, earning $150 million in the first weekend and so on. Any attempts to logically discuss audience numbers/ticket sales or how other non-Star Wars sci fi films have fared at the box office were immediately shot down. There was some discussion about people betting things like their life savings or first born children on the super success of this film! I myself bet a pan of my outrageously good triple-chocolate brownies to anyone who backed on the ""$150 million first weekend""....my brownies are safe! And it's now time for the fangeeks to pay up...cuz ""Serenity"", which debuted at No. 2 (on an exceptionally slow weekend) has sunk in only one week to....No. 9. Well behind front runner ""Wallace and Gromit"", LOL.Even at No. 2, ""Serenity"" only earned $10.2 million, which is chump change in the film industry. So, the gist here is that my instincts were exactly on target. And the fangeeks...as usual, wrong.BTW: I do not, as some of them accused, hate ""Serenity"" OR ""Firefly"". I thought the series was a moderately interesting, humorous series, which some good and (of course) some bad or awkward points. It was not the best sci fi I had ever seen, and it was far from the worst. However, one thing stood out: it failed to find a large scale TV audience that would have allowed it to run a reasonable length of time on the tube (and hence, into Trek-like re-runs). I refuted the idea that Fox was ""mean"" to the series or showed it out of order -- original ""Star Trek"" was shown out of order in its original run on TV, and that didn't seem to do it any harm. And TV audiences had no trouble finding and supporting shows like ""Battlestar Galatica"", ""Stargate SG"" or ""Farscape"" (off the air, but it ran for FOUR SEASONS, not 11 episodes).The upshot and my (hopefully) final comment on this board is this: it's nearly impossible to take a failed, short-lived TV show and make a really blockbuster movie out of it. Given the situation, Whedon and crew did a reasonable job of making what would have been a KICK-ASS television special. However, there was probably no reasonable way on a $40 mill budget to produce anything that would awe your average (non-fangeek) audience member. The film is also flawed in the respect that it's too obscure, clubby and insiderish...it was created for the fans of the show, not the masses. That aside, yes it's the best episode of ""Firefly"" EVER...literally.Say goodbye, boys and girls. And, they aren't making any more big screen sequels to ""My Mother The Car"", either.",Serenity
180,Andreas_N,Thoroughly overrated and shallow,4,26 November 2005,"The movie is not a 1 to be fair. I just gave it a 1 to lower its rating, as I cannot grasp how this average, simple-minded movie could make its way into the Top-250 and stand at 8.2 right now. This is maybe the most overrated movie I have ever encountered at IMDb. Now, let us go into details to outline my approach to the subject.Many reviewers have stated that this movie is almost as weighty as Star Wars, that it features outstanding images and plot elements of superior quality, that the characters are perfectly cast and convincingly portrayed, that the storyline is suspense-packed and exciting, the there are no pauses nor flaws in the progress of the plot; and that this movie is to be acknowledged due to its wonderful conformity with 'Firefly'.1. 'As weighty as Star Wars': How dare anybody frivolously compare this one to a movie of historical importance like Star Wars? Having heard that prior to watching Serenity, I was expecting a staggering movie with a reasonable background story and stunning pomp. However, I have seen many better science-fiction movies with more sophisticated background settings and plot revelations. Serenity is by no means a valuable movie, and to place it at near contiguity to the original Star Wars movies is not merely reckless but almost disgraceful.2. 'Outstanding images': Every average science-fiction movie is capable of matching Serenity. I actually had the impression of seeing a B movie with a low budget endowment. Not a single occasion made me acknowledge any quality of the visual input, nor was the camera work matching the pace and the dramatic composition of the decisive moments.3. 'Plot elements of superior quality': Now this is a joke, right? I might concede that Firefly-fans have a certain legitimization to engage in rave reviews, but an exacting movie ought to refrain from merely comforting moviegoers who have seen the series or who have read the book etc, but rather provide a reasonable and coherent storyline for everyone. There were considerable gaps in the plot. The story was very simple and sometimes lacking to attend to a sophisticated plot development. A reviewer declared Serenity a humble copy of the 'precogs'-idea derived from Minority Report, and I tend to agree with this approach. There were no surprises, flat storyline evolutions and generally a very thin plot that is known from other movies already and implemented in an almost dismal manner.4. 'Characters are perfectly cast and convincingly portrayed': Ha, another joke! Again, Firefly-fans might have the background knowledge essential for assessing the individual characters due to their pre-gained knowledge from the series. I was perfectly surprised at which daunting flatness and coldness the protagonists were portrayed. Rated from the angle of character portrayal and development, this movie falls flat. River is the archetype of the unidimensional character, with her 'inventive' ""I swallowed a bug""-remark as an example for her lack of sophistication. The other crew members may have certain characteristics and skills, but there is absolutely no sophisticated approach to any of them. Rather I had the strong feeling of a corny black-and-white portrayal. There was no development nor deep commitment to the protagonists characterization. Captain Reynolds, who was responsible for the plot advancement, was almost as flat as River's brother, to whom I could not relate at all. This aspect is almost as weak as it could have possibly been.5. 'Storyline is suspense-packed and exciting, no pauses nor flaws': Finally I have to say that despite the weak points stated above, the suspense was very, very modest. I was never caught at the edge of my seat, the logic of the movie was shallow and the excitement was very much hampered by the crudities of style and background development. There was just nothing at all that appealed to me, and thus I was somewhat disappointed.Now, as stated above, this movie doesn't deserve a 1. I'd normally give it a 5. Yet I can by no means accept Serenity's high rating and its admission to the Top-250, which is a thorough shame. Thus I feel obliged to give it a 1 due to the points previously made.",Serenity
181,hawaiialin,Great but...,7,15 February 2021,"Main cast was very good, having never watched the firefly series I went into this blind, and gauge as such. Special effects for 2005 were very good, but could have been excellent. It felt like almost like a made for tv movie, but delivered a solid overall entertainment value till the end.",Serenity
182,cyclone259,Mixed feelings,9,26 April 2010,"I wasn't an avid 'Firefly' fan when I first saw 'Serenity' back in 2005, although I'd heard of the show. I actually happened to catch Serenity on HBO and that's what introduced me to the characters and storyline. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie (I've seen it about five times), but by that time the series was long gone and I never seemed to catch it on re-runs.We recently got Netflix and my wife and I both sat down over a period of a couple of weeks, and watched all of the episodes in order as they were supposed to be originally. It saddened me that a jewel of a show was lost because Fox managed to screw-up something worthwhile again, because it wasn't some reality show or sitcom. Firefly isn't easy to pigeonhole into one genre or another: true, it's sci-fi first, then it has western overtones, drama, comedy and amazing simple, yet effective character dynamics and story lines.There's nothing convoluted about how they go about things in Firefly and I enjoyed it because, it wasn't a 'feel-good/happy ending'show. There are interpersonal issues and underlying feelings between all of the characters that are very strong and sometimes unpredictable, such as with River Tam portrayed brilliantly by Summer Glau.Now that I've watched the complete series and know how the characters fit into their roles, I've re-watched Serenity through different eyes. Is it as good as Firefly? Mainly yes. The CGI and action in the movie was beyond what the show offered due to its budget and so there were improvements in that area.I think for me the shortcomings were not giving a bit more of a role to Shepherd Book played by Ron Glass. I realize that his part in the series wasn't pivotal, but he helped give a different insight and viewpoint, especially given their exploits. To me, there was a lot more to him that they weren't fully able to explore in the series, such as how exactly he had all the military knowledge that was inferred in the t.v. show. He only made one vocal nod to Mal that there was indeed more to him, but that he wasn't willing to share it. I also thought more could've been done with Inara, but to those who didn't know the back story, it probably would've been confusing.I understand why Books and Inara weren't given larger participation, because Joss Whedon wanted to make a movie not only for the fans, but also for a much wider audience. I don't want to nitpick the movie to death, because it is what it is and I still enjoy it. All in all, Serenity can easily stand on its own, but hopefully there will be more stories to tell someday.",Serenity
183,LouE15,Great sci-fi follow up to a series pulled abruptly to a halt,9,2 June 2008,"It's really hard to talk about this film dispassionately if you've already seen and loved the series. It's hard to know whether it would really stand on its own as a film without that prior knowledge  and love  of the story and characters the series introduced us to. I'll start by saying that I defy anyone to see the series and NOT love it; and that having got that far, you'd just have to watch ""Serenity"", no argument. ""Serenity"" has now been released with some film called ""Doom"" on a double DVD here in the UK, which I guess gives an indication that, again, nobody knows what to do with Joss Whedon.This film doesn't answer all the questions left by the shameful pulling of ""Firefly"" before the end of its run, but it helps fill the yawning gap a little. And being a Joss Whedon project, it's as full of snappy dialogue, visual and verbal humour, great characters and an interesting scenario as we've all come to expect of the man. Really, given his past with ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"", you'd think the TV people would have had a little more faith. But they didn't, and ""Serenity"" emerged, I guess, from their lack of faith, and only when it became screamingly apparent that, despite the marketeers' projections and stats, there was an appetite for this stuff.How to even get started on the story? I'll be brief: in a new, future world, the 'world' is a series of planets, populated after a devastating war by humans with varying degrees of comfort or utility. The 'central planets' are the big, posh, well-kept and monitored places where rich people live safely. The 'outer planets' are the pioneer territory: so much so that a sort of reversion takes place in those who live there, either because they have nowhere else to go or because they seek a new opportunity: they start to take on rough 'Wild West' language and lose all semblance of their 'central planet' veneer. Some go further than this. Captain Mal Reynolds is a bad man: he's a thief and trafficker; but he has a code, and this has kept him alive and kept him sane. He has chinks through which good things can reach. His ship  Serenity  carries an odd assorted crew, including Simon and River Tam: brother and sister both a long, long way from home. River was abducted by the Alliance  fascistic Big Brother authority figure with good but blind intentions  and her unusual intelligence and psychic ability meant that she was to become a very powerful weapon. Simon looks after River: and this film is all about her. River trod the margins of the series; many episodes were about her, but few directly. This time, the whole film is working through her story  and intertwining it with Mal's.The only thing I regretted in this excellent film was that there wasn't much of the Mal-Inara story that had been flirted with on and off throughout the series. I saw from the director's commentary and outtakes that there would have been more of them  but that it interfered with the pace of the story  shame. Had the series continued to its natural length there would have been ample time to explore this story in the detail it deserves.I nearly had a tantrum when the film came to an end: I want more of this in the same way that I hated each series of ""Deadwood"" coming to an end, or ""The Wire"" for that matter. I love the world he's created here; the outcast family  Whedon's specialism  and the understanding he shows of the benevolent majority world gone wrong, and those who live outside it. It's well-made, well shot; the actors are on familiar ground and it shows  and for an added bonus it has as its baddie, the rather wonderful Chetwiejel Ojiofor. Oh, how the camera loves that man. And Nathan Fillion is such a star: I wish him a career like Harrison Ford's, though I suspect he won't get it while the great legion of tedious Bread Pitts and Bored Clooneys rule the big screens. Tooodd  too characterful. Thank goodness: I'll always know that this is a world I can retreat into for a while, to gather myself in, and remember why I like things  and people, and films  to be just a bit different.",Serenity
184,Mr_PCM,The return of Whedon,9,27 February 2006,"Serenity is probably the very definition of a cult film. Coming off the back of short-lived cancelled TV show Firefly, Serenity is the show's continuation and transfer to the big screen. Although the series lasted only fourteen episodes, it had the good fortune to be created by Joss Whedon, the ultimate fanboy. Whedon is also blessed with a built-in cult following thanks to the success of his TV series 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and it's spin-off 'Angel'. This huge fanbase, although not enough to save the series from cancellation, ensured that whilst gone it was most certainly not forgotten. After huge sales following the release of the series on DVD, demand rose for a film. Not since Star Trek has a sci-fi TV series been cancelled and, thanks to the weight of fan support, gone on to become a successful film. Again however, Serenity was not a massive hit at the box office, and it remains to be seen if once again DVD sales can bring about another resurrection.But as for the film itself, Serenity is a work of genius, but this has come to be expected from the man known as Joss Whedon. Fans of Whedon and his earlier work will not be disappointed by his first big screen outing. The best way to describe the film would be that of 'space western', for it is by no means traditional sci-fi fare. For starters, there are no aliens whatsoever. There is also no travelling faster than the speed of light, and not everybody lives in beautiful clean and green ultra-modern cities. On the outskirts of civilisation life is more like in the old wild west. This somehow makes it feel more real and possible  the old west was the new frontier in the nineteenth century, and Serenity attempts to create a sense of a 'new' new frontier.What makes the film so successful it is that it is accessible for both fans of the series and newcomers. There are plenty of in-jokes and plot and character developments picked up from the series to keep the rabid fans happy. But Serenity is also open to those who have not seen the original TV series, with a brief introduction included at the start for newcomers.Also there is the ever-present sense of anarchic irreverence and sharp self-awareness and Joss's own determination not to conform to standard ideas about TV series that made Buffy such a major success. The characters are not self-righteous holier-than-thou heroes, but rather everyday folk just making a living. The government do not protect and provide for all their citizens, but rather only seem interested in uniformity and conformity.The acting is terrific. Nathan Fillion has created a new anti-hero in Captain Malcolm Reynolds, and shares more than a few character traits with that definitive sci-fi anti-hero, Han Solo (no doubt intentional, due to Whedon's love of Star Wars). The characters all have real depth, and are all lovable in their own ways. Although Fillion's Reynolds shares great similarity with Han Solo, Serenity never feels like a rip-off of Star Wars or Star Trek, but more like a new and fresh take on the whole sci-fi genre. Exciting action is mixed with Whedon's own brand of comedy, and the film feels like much more than simply an extended episode of the TV series for the big screen.For Whedon fans, Serenity is an absolute must. For sci-fi fans, Serenity is an absolute must. However, non-fans of either the genre or the man will probably dislike it  and thus Serenity's potentially limited appeal will inevitably lead to a 'cult status' label. But fans of this particular cult will absolutely love it.",Serenity

I never saw Firefly, so had no expectations",7,9 February 2020,"In the big picture, you could ding it for being unoriginal, since it seems like a melange of Millenium Falcon and Fifth Element & Chronicles of Riddick & a couple of things I can't put my finger on. But, in the details, it has its own unique style & its own patois, both of which are pluses. The pluses: Stylish, humorous, enough action without being overwhelmed by CGI, straight spaceship-based action movie without heavy-handed political statements, other than the main one which it basically shares with another dozen such movies.",Serenity
186,JRmf,Promising but ultimately disappointing,5,9 December 2005,"Maybe this movie makes a lot more sense if you have spent many hours being entranced by the series. Seeing a few trailers, the obvious quality and imagination of the CGI, and being a sucker for Sci-Fi, I had high hopes for this movie, but as my Summary goes...The CGI, the look of the ships and environment is interesting. But the basic story I found incoherent and relatively uninteresting. Is it the current tendency to ""cleverness"" via incomprehensibility and incoherence? We mustn't be too logical. Give me a Spielberg epic any day: solid coherent smart storytelling with intelligent surprises (generally - WOWT was an exception). Mumbled lines by some of the main actors didn't help in grasping any plot.""River"" Tam - sound like ""Reaver"" - to the uninitiated, and given her fighting skills, I found my self wondering if she were one of ""them"". The Reavers are cannibalistic monsters, apparently a minority result of the PAX - which is thrown in almost as an afterthought, a solution to a question of which one is only vaguely aware. The Reavers like all monsters are only hinted at - but one never gets to see them in their full hideousness either, a lost opportunity IMHO.Serenity's red paint job so it could slip unnoticed through the reaver ships clumped in a small section of space doesn't make a lot of sense. Space is vast.River is obviously the key to some great and terrible mystery - if only it were clear what that is.Just a few random comments. Really a movie for the fans.",Serenity
187,thousandisland,WOW... What a ride !,9,12 January 2006,"People who compare this movie to the original Star Wars are exactly right. Firefly and Serenity have something that nearly all modern films (and absolutely all modern Sci Fi films) lack. That is character development and the ability to make the audience care about the people they're watching. My theory is that Joss Whedon knows something that no one else in Hollywood does. He knows how to incorporate humor and personality into his characters so that they are solid as human beings, and how to avoid modern clichés. He can also create a story that anyone will get wrapped up in. Forget your boring ""Deep Space Nine""s and confounding ""Babylon 5""s. Throw Andromeda into the fire (PLEASE) and ignore everything you've heard about Science Fiction being for geeks or dateless wonders. I wouldn't even call Serenity a 'Sci Fi' since it has so little in common with everything else that is falling under that heading nowadays. Serenity is like what Sci Fi USED to be. The original Star Wars is for everyone to enjoy, as is the original Star Trek, and Serenity takes its cues from these. At the same time, it is fresh and funny, and sometimes sad and shocking, but it leaves you with this beautiful hope that there really are brain cells firing in Hollywood. Don't judge this film by the horrible previews you saw. They tried to sell it on the lowest denominator possible, which is an insult to this great series and its characters. See it and be amazed. Then be sure to pick up Firefly, and get ready to fall in love like the rest of us have.",Serenity

You can get the DVDs cheap - do yourself a favour and do so. I've long been of the opinion that being in the majority is a bad thing, and as the majority didn't watch Firefly or Serenity then I feel justified. How such a funny, interesting, exciting, touching, well-observed and lovingly made show failed to catch on I'll never know...This is top stuff - go buy and, on your way to and from the store, tell other people to buy it too!

190,c-kelsall,Among the best sci-fi action films ever made,9,7 November 2005,"Serenity has been described as a Western in space, but that really doesn't do it justice by a long way. Set around 500 years in the future, the colonised worlds under the governance of the Alliance have recovered from a territorial war between the all-conquering Alliance and a rebel opposition force. Propelled into a life of bootlegging, rebel survivor Mal Reynolds and his rag-tag crew live life under the radar of Alliance control, aboard their ship Serenity. However, things get very messy for the crew when they discover that the Alliance will stop at nothing to track them down. If you're a sci-fi fan, and this doesn't float your boat, I don't know what will. Even if you don't like sci-fi as a rule, you should try Serenity, because the basic elements of good film-making lie at the heart of it. Quite possibly the best sci-fi action film ever made, Serenity combines razor-sharp dialogue, expertly edited action, a tidy interesting story, interesting characters and solid performances from the cast. As a ""sequel"" to the vastly under-rated TV series Firefly, it neither alienates it's original fan base, nor poses problems for new fans of Joss Whedon's world. I can't think of a better way to spend nigh-on 2 hours of one's life.",Serenity

If you have seen the trailer, you should be perfectly informed that this movie was never meant to be serious scifi. A 16-year old kungfu-fighting girl...?! If you expect Asimov-standard after this, you gonna be seriously disappointed.So lets keep it real. This movie is a really nice piece of entertainment. It is fast, it is fun, it is done well. You get some pretty well executed kungfu-fights, spaceships battles, and loads of action. If you expect more, go and watch 2001 or Star Wars again. This movie shows what Han Solo's life could have been before he met Obi Wan Kenobi in the Mos Eisley Cantina. And that hasn't been done well too often so far. I liked the characters, they felt all believable enough.It won't make it in my ""10 best scifi-movies"", it is far from perfect. But i felt pretty well entertained most of the time.",Serenity
193,aji4u4ever,Sci-Fi Saga,9,27 January 2019,"After performing as a screenwriter for several Sci-Fi movies like Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Toy Story, Alien Resurrection Jos Whedon made his debut with this sci-fi action movie Serenity. This was a continuation of his discontinued television series ""Firefly"".26th century, when the Earth was overpopulated and the humanity left to colonize a new solar system. River Tam a psychic assassin is on the loose. She read the minds of several top government of Alliance, an organization formed by the central planets is hunting her coz she knew the deadly secrets.

Nathan Fillion as Mal delivers a brilliant performance. He was funny, action, and acting was good. Summer Glau as River Tam, Morena Baccarin (Deadpool 2), Chiweter Ejiofor ad The Operative and many more actors played their part well. The music was composed by David Newman was absolutely synced with the Movie.I always hoped a sequel of this Action powered sci-fi saga but it wont happen for sure coz unfortunately it bombed in Box Office.An under rated gem.8.5 on 10",Serenity
194,tbyrne4,What the heck????,3,15 December 2005,"Am I the only person who thinks this movie stinks???? Did I not see the same movie as you people?? I seem to be in the minority here as I've never watched Firefly - heck, I'd never even HEARD of it until this movie came out. I had seen Buffy, only because my girlfriend forced me to watch it with her, and I couldn't stand it. But I did go into this with an open mind. Actually, I was totally stoked to see it. After the past three George Lucas snooze-fests I had practically written off ""romantic"" sci-fi, which brought me great sadness as I hold the first three Star Wars near and dear to my heart, having grown up with them and loved them tremendously.Serenity received great reviews when it was first released, but I didn't get a chance to see it so, as I said, I was looking forward to checking it out on DVD. I rushed right out today and rented a copy and settled back fully expecting to be entertained. WAs I expecting too much?? I don't know. What happened? What am I missing? This must have been one heck of a show! The movie starts out well, as we find out about River Tam and her psychic gift/curse, along with her caretaker brother, and the motley Serenity crew. Then it goes downhill in a hurry.I'll start with the bad stuff (there's more bad than good, believe me) and get it out of the way. First off, this film looks like it was shot for about $200,000. All of the sets look recycled from the old Battlestar Galactica show (I think they threw in the costumes, too) and all the exteriors look like they were shot at Sunset Canyon (how come all these planets look the same!@!). And the special effects look like the ones that used to fly Gil Gerard and Twiki around on Buck Rogers. Seriously. This is low grade stuff. All of the interiors look essentially identical. Where is the attention to detail? Where is the sense that the ship has been lived in? Secondly, do these characters have personalities? They don't seem to interact with each other. They say bad, ""witty"" lines at each other. I knew a climatic scene was about to a). end or b). begin, because someone would spout a clever one-liner. Like watching from the studio audience and seeing the red ""laugh"" light. Oh, I'm supposed to find this part endearing or funny. A good number of the situations seemed artificial. False. Another element I disliked was the sense the every actor in this movie looked like someone you'd only see on Canadian television. Am I being too mean? Perhaps. But I feel disappointed and seeing so many slather praise on this film I won't feel guilty. I am in the minority.A fourth element I disliked about this dumb movie was that I felt absolutely no sense of dread. No menace. River's story is kind of the focal point and she must feel a great sense of menace. Her feelings about herself, what others think of her. But nothing came through. Don't get me wrong - SHE was good. The actress who played River was fine, but no sense of menace came through. Perhaps Whedon has been working in the antiseptic world of TV for too long. He doesn't know how to draw blood. Where is the fear we should feel when the Reaver's (sp?) show up? I didn't feel it all. Just looked like a bunch of guys in gore make-up. What the film does have in (unfortunate) abundance is corniness. I found myself rolling my eyes continually at the hokey lines and situations.The whole Mister Universe thing is hopelessly trite. Essentially just a ""kid"" plugged into the solar system communications airwaves. ""Duh, kinda like a twelve year old smart kid who can surf the net and break into microsoft?"" Uh, yeah, real imaginative.DANG IT, the whole construct just plain felt LIKE TV. Maybe that's what bugged me so much about it.NOw, the film does have some good stuff. It starts very well (very clever too, I might add). It does have scenes of genuine heartfelt sadness. There are some lines of dialogue that are quite beautiful. At one point River says ""Make me a stone"" when trying to shut a terrible memory out of her head. Moments like that are great. A few of the performances are good. The guy who plays Mal needs to go. I'm not sure who he is, but he's no Harrison Ford, lets face it. The girl who plays River Tam is excellent and the guy who plays the assassin (also the only guy I've seen in another movie) is quite good. The film does have one great scene, and that's where River goes berserk for the first time. It's great because it's totally unexpected and when she does go berserk it really does appear to be the actress going kung fu crazy.I also liked the end. I liked the fact that it ended, but I also liked the way it ended. I also did like the fact that Whedon was trying to make something genuinely heartfelt. That he was trying to reach people on some kind of human level. That is worth some praise.I think this whole thing may be (as others have deftly pointed out) a case of fanboy love run amuck. Scratch that, fanboy love storming the palace gates and infecting the kingdom with some sort of virus. It seems to have infected the minds of the critics.",Serenity
195,ThatMonkey,"Sly like a ""Fox""",9,4 October 2005,"Fox reminds me of Seattle sports. Many players that have played for pro teams in Seattle have been dealt by their respected teams only to leave and get a championship ring for another city. That is also the trademark of Fox TV. Many shows have been cut from Fox's lineup before their prime. Shows like, Family guy, Fastlane, Quintuplets, That 80's Show and obviously Firefly.Although I am a fan of television, I never saw this show. Matter of fact at the time that the trailer caught my eye, I didn't even know it was a show. On the strength of the trailer I went to the movie and found it to be incredible. It wasn't the greatest story every told, but it was fresh. I didn't feel like I was missing anything from not watching the TV show and most of all, the movies looked like a long form TV, meaning that I would assume that the movie was very true to the TV show in regards to content, quality and production value.TV used to be about entertainment, now it's about selling commercials. The down side to all of that is the fact that poor TV or too many commercials take the fans out of broadcast TV.Thank God for TV on DVD, it's about the best bet in TV today.See this movie, and be like me and get yourself the complete series on DVD.",Serenity
196,gothic_a666,Pathetic.,1,17 March 2006,"Absurd and hopelessly flawed, in so many ways, this movie's greatest shortcoming is that not only does it offer nothing new whatsoever, as it takes itself extremely seriously. Now, let's analyse just how much of a rip-off this movie actually is, strip it down of its pretensions and reveal a naked sore bleeding gooey plagiarism from ever pore. First of all, River. This character, or this vague impression of a character, is a less stunning version of the Fifth Element. Everything is there: the odd mutism and apparent frailty contrasted with sudden bursts of febrile violent activity, and enough allusions to a pseudo mental ability that is close to preternatural. To this we add a shady and obviously evil entity that has conditioned said River, so now the source was the series Dark Angel, which is not exactly mind blowing either. All other characters: The Chronicles of Riddick. I will keep from commenting further on this particular detail, I shall only bring to attention that it's a case of very bad being copied into even worse. Now, dialogue. Of all disjointed and ridiculous lines to choose from this movie elected the worst of the worst, a most thorough selection that I am sure was not accidental. For example:***Spoiler***Right before a great shoot down, male character turns to distraught female and confesses that he regrets never have ""being with her"", to which she replies ""you mean sex?"". Not only does this kind of banter not agree with a dramatic and potentially final scene as the choice of words was simply hilarious. Prudish vagaries that would have made a Victorian laugh are here presented as chivalrous and quite current, and as for the girl's reaction, who suddenly decides to ""live"" is an insult to mankind as a whole.At the end, when the captain decides to explain that all one needs to fly a ship is ""love"". I admit I did laugh, it was simply too much and already the movie had dragged out too many idiotic lines in the same vein, from heroic speeches to two ""famous last words"" scenes, and an unbelievingly moronic ""Believe in anything, just BELIEVE!"" we are subjected to all degrees and orders of insipid dialogue. ***Spoiler***Plot, there is none to speak of. Due to all characters' amazingly lack of foresight, even though one of them is supposed to be a medium of some kind (a completely battered version of a Bene Gesserit, I suppose), events seem to spring out of nowhere and to be introduced at random points for the sake of convenience. Equally arbitrary is the editing, coupled with a few touches of Star Wars' imagery, and most appalling was the attempt to recreate an authorial regime, perhaps trying to opt for an Huxylexian perspective, yet failing to ascribe any depth or even coherence to any of the badly patched rush of flashy images that flow from frame to frame with little inner logic. Also, James Bond-like great single combats on high tech structures that look both menacing and quite useless coupled with blatant contradictions that invest the whole corpus of the movie and no comprehensive notion of technology or of a particular world-scape do not help and can only drag this already horrible endeavour a few rungs lower in the scale of cinematographic value. All in all, this movie was a painful experience to endure and can only be interested if one is to take it as a compilation comprising all clichés ever to haunt the genre. Oh, something that amused me, was the reference to Coleridge's poem ""The Rime of the Old Mariner"", which was not only completely out of place as was sure to make poor Samuel turn on his grave. Just for that, this movie was condemnable.",Serenity
197,ztigr,Watched again for the like 100th time,10,12 August 2018,"Shame on Foxx for doing such a disservice to this series. Shame on SYFY for missing the boat on picking it up. Too bad Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon wasn't going strong yet when this series was around to save it. This movie brought my attention to the series and I love both. Though it has begun to show some age, the fun dialogue, the great chemistry of the actors, and the overall premise are still worth a watch. The people who give this bad reviews obviously don't get the premise. Its the old west in space, and the dialogue is meant to sound a bit campy. I have one small criticism of the movie, in that all the planets involved are located so close together to the point of making space seem small. In the show they always took a while to get places because its one massive solar system and of course they don't travel at Star Wars or Star Trek speeds. I thought that was a good decision in the show to keep the series technology limited in reflection of its wild west type atmosphere. In the movie they unnecessarily keep referring to how close everything is. I think the better choice would have been to leave it ambiguous.In reality this is more of what you might think a Solo movie should look like, not what we got from Ron Howard.Last, Joss Whedon's passion for this project is what drives it. He did a good job on the Avengers also. I get some of the criticism of his style, and Justice League was terrible (maybe not his fault), but he didn't do anything to save it at least. Give it a watch, maybe you'll get hooked too.",Serenity
198,psi_fla,Serene this ain't,7,14 October 2005,"A few years ago, Joss Whedon's television show Firefly was axed after half a season. We should definitely be thankful, then, that the show has since attained a cult following, thus allowing Whedon the permission from Universal to reunite his lost characters for a highly entertaining romp.Summer Glau plays the unpredictable River Tam, a telepathic teenager who Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and his crew aboard the ship ""Serenity"" are suddenly in doubt about protecting. This is because a certain event has caused her to lash out against her own defenders. However, they maintain their protection instincts, but have to try even harder to do so since The Operator (Chiwetel Ejiofor, at his best) is attempting to chain down River at all costs.It's not very original, of course. The stunts are a bit like Buffy's (maybe even Matrix-lite), you'll have seen similar battles in the likes of Star Wars and there's tons of exposition that only true devotees (and I'm not one of them) will fully grasp. But it is carried off with a degree of charm and playfulness as well as seriousness. Whedon has little or no time for the broodiness of Chris Nolan or the pompous approach of George Lucas. If you've watched Buffy, Angel or any of his TV shows, he uses the same tone here, and it works. His largely unknown cast acquit themselves well.Serenity may seem like a lightweight space opera at first glance, but there's more to it than you think. The film and its characters become more interesting as the film goes on; interesting enough, actually, for the film to deservedly earn its two hour running length. At this stage I am happy to declare it one of 2005's hidden treasures, and a welcome antidote to the big budget let downs we have already had this year.Rating: 7.5/10",Serenity

Either it lasts for too long and starts to run in circles and recycle itself, or it's so good it eventualy gets cancelled mid-season or at the end of the first one. Firefly was one of those short-lived science-fiction series, the original V another one but I'm getting out of line here. Firefly was a space-opera version of a post-civil-war american story, with bitter confederate true-believers as protagonists and an over-reaching union as the bad guys. I'm almost not exagerating, but it was probably produced by fox. That said, the non-aligned army spoke mandarin and didn't seem to rely on slavery because it's fiction afterall, and for every other question raised by watching the series, I wish they had a shot at a second season.

202,MVictorPjinsiste,Whedon's Transition From Small to Big Screen,7,19 July 2018,"I'll review this film as someone who has seen the sole Firefly season, a show I did like and appreciate like I do with every Whedon creation at some point, for amazing dialogues and great character interaction, as well as the great stories. I particularly liked the wild space frontier aspect and the presence of Morena Baccarin in a deep, subtle role. She doesn't have much to shine about here, alas.This movie represents Whedon's passage from TV, where he mastered all tropes, to cinema, where he was a relative newcomer, and it shows in the rather harduous work of tempo, and compression of events. After the series, there must have been a hundred subplots lying here and there, that ended on the cutting floor, and for which quick decisions have been taken. As a result, the movie is lacking in relation with the season's subtility and pace, ending up more butter than bread.Action scenes, better visuals and fast relations (that doesn't make make obvious sense to those who didn't followed Firefly) have taken over slow personality tuning and unspoken feelings, while the scope of the their world is also quite reduced. It is a pleasant experience, by all means, but I personally would have preferred an extre season, obviously.Just another comment to say how Nathan Fillion, who I thought was miscast in Firefly, litterally carries the whole show on his shoulders here, playing a character that's hard to like and yet for which we care about - that's no small feat, and all to his credit.",Serenity

204,sunraider,Disappointing,5,2 October 2005,"I first became interested in FIREFLY, the series, and SERENITY, through the early trailers shown back in May. AFter seeing the trailer I rented the series, loved it, and since purchasing the DVD have seen it many times. I really looked forward to the movie. Unfortunately, the movie didn't live up to the trailer and was mediocre at best. None of the elements that made the series so enjoyable are present. Gone are deep character development and the lively interaction among the crew members. Book and Inara are really just cameos,while Kaylee, Wash, and even Simon have little to do. The heart of FIREFLY was the relationship between Simon and River, but it's little explored here. Humor and hints of romance are, for the most part, absent. The plot is action-heavy and really is just the crew trying to escape from Reavers. The entire rationale behind the Alliance's desperate need to eliminate River Tam is uninteresting and the explanation for the existence of the Reavers is truly lame. It was much more interesting to have the Reavers be humans who'd gone wild on the outer rim. I kept waiting for the ""two-by-two, hands-of-blue"" creeps to show up but they never did. Finally, the operative's bizarre about-face at the end makes no sense. Seeing this poor feature film makes me love the FIREFLY series even more. I was hooked at the end of the first half, when Mal opens up the crate carrying River. There will be no trilogy here.",Serenity
205,Ysman,Lucas Reborn?,9,30 September 2005,"Since George Lucas stepped away from his throne in 1983, many have tried to come and replicate the success of the Holy Trinity of science fiction films. Most attempts were thwarted before they even began. The Wachowskis made a noble effort with The Matrix in 1999 yet they fell victim to CGI extravagance and to their own over inflated views on the landscape they created producing sequels that were nothing more than exercises in ""hey look at what we can do with a PC and 100 million dollars at our disposal."" Even Lucas tried to reclaim what was rightfully his and alas he too was more interested in the technology than the storytelling creating 3 criminally stilted, wooden prequels that only tarnished the films that almost everyone holds dear.Enter Joss Whedon. What Whedon has done is eerily similar to what Lucas did in '77 taking a cast of relative unknowns, the most famous being Animal Mother from Full Metal Jacket and Pirate Steve from Dodgeball, and creating a compelling, exciting space western. Serenity is what Star Wars would have been if the focus was on Han rather than that pansy-a$$, Luke. What is more exciting is that what Lucas lacks, Whedon has in spades. Having cut his teeth on television series and script doctoring, most notably Toy Story, the dialog is crisp, witty, never forced, and almost Mamet-esquire in its pacing and originality. The language used recalls a nod to the old west without veering towards the ridiculous and without falling trap to invented ""space dialog."" Whedon, too, finds a rhythm with his actors and since they are relative unknowns, the audience has no trouble letting them become the characters they portray. While it is not completely fair to continually draw comparisons to Star Wars and Lucas, it is evident Whedon is a fan.From the Serenity website {ed note: no need to rework what has already been written}: Serenity centers around Captain Malcolm Reynolds, a hardened veteran (on the losing side) of a galactic civil war, who now ekes out a living pulling off small crimes and transport-for-hire aboard his ship, Serenity. He leads a small, eclectic crew who are the closest thing he has left to family - squabbling, insubordinate and undyingly loyal. When Mal takes on two new passengers - a young doctor and his unstable, telepathic sister - he gets much more than he bargained for. The pair are fugitives from the coalition dominating the universe, who will stop at nothing to reclaim the girl.The crew that was once used to skimming the outskirts of the galaxy unnoticed find themselves caught between the unstoppable military force of the Universal Alliance and the horrific, cannibalistic fury of the Reavers, savages who roam the very edge of space. Hunted by vastly different enemies, they begin to discover that the greatest danger to them may be on board Serenity herself.Having never seen a minute of the television show from which the movie originated, I am unsure of how much of a back story or character history I am missing however watching the film, I never felt left out of an inside joke or nods to the hard-core fandom. The story isn't weighted down with trying to establish an environment or character origins. The characters are richly drawn without being obvious clichés and the story begins and ends without the false promise of useless, unnecessary sequels.In the world where box office numbers are king, it cannot yet be told what the future holds for the Serenity universe. Whedon takes on Wonder Woman next and that will be, most likely, what will cause people to start referring to his name as a precursor to the titles of his films. That said, it would be a shame if this were the only film we have that scrapes the surface of the Alliance and shows us only a single voyage of the Captain Malcolm Reynolds and crew of the Serenity. The landscape is far too rich and the possible stories are seemingly endless. And if future stories are told, lets just hope that Joss is not so much a fan of Lucas that he becomes like him and destroys everything that made him great.Serenity gets an A- (A minus.)",Serenity
206,butravi,Need sequels,10,22 August 2019,"A stunning space adventure, and doesn't get dated even though its from 2005 (its 2019 now).
If you have watched tv series firefly, then its an added bonus, as this movie continues with that series.
Joss whedon's finest direction, and anyone who watches it will want sequels to be made.",Serenity
207,BJBatimdb,Did I see the same movie??,4,1 November 2005,"I rushed to see this movie after seeing the great reviews and high score on IMDb. I am a BIG scifi fan and would rather watch bad scifi than an average anything-else, so figured I was in a win-win situation. Even if it was bad it would be good, right?Wrong.The first five minutes of this movie were packed with exposition and bad dialogue, and my friend asked if we should leave. I wanted to give the film a fair viewing and was SURE it would get better, but I was sorely mistaken.The movie has potential and is filled with very funny lines. However, this completely undermines the drama and tension of the piece. However serious, scary, dramatic or sad the scene is supposed to be, the writer cannot resist throwing in a funny line, shattering everything that's gone before. At first the lines are enjoyable, but by 20 minutes in, I was just waiting for the crack, and not caring about the story or the characters. At the same time, Serenity doesn't have the feeling of a comedy. It's just a straight scifi film packed with queasily inappropriate funny lines.It's an unusual piece of self-sabotage and a real waste of story, characters, actors, FX etc etc.I can only imagine the outstanding reviews are from friends and relatives of the cast and crew, and from MTV-generation Firefly fans who just want to register a protest at the show being cancelled.A waste of good scifi.",Serenity
208,pookey56,oops!,8,15 October 2005,"being an ardent sci-fi and fantasy fan i am ashamed to admit that i am unfamiliar with firefly. i deliberately went without doing any kind of research about this series because i wanted to see this film without any expectations. and i wanted to be surprised by it. the beginning started with what looked like child abuse. o how i hate vivisection and experimentations on living beings. i also noticed an attempt at casual humour in the dialogue between the characters, but i didn't laugh. i thought, o no, i'm not going to like this movie despite the good reviews. but i liked the observation made that the rescuing brother loved his troubled, messed-with sister. and then, i fell asleep!! being an insomniac and generally sleeping only 4 or 5 hours a night at most, i couldn't believe it! and then, i heard a loud, loud noise and i thought one of my cats was turning up the sound with the remote control again (they do that). when i realized where i was (in a theatre!)i kicked myself and saw the rest of the film. i watched a female martial artist beat the crap out of the bad guys. better than android skills. i watched some deaths of the crew and felt saddened. i saw more of the interaction of the captain and his crew and watched them escape the cannibals. you can see i slept through some important stuff. i thought the brother had died until i saw him at the end. clearly i have to watch this film again, because what i woke up to was entertaining and unapologetic. i'm familiar with his television works and his Buffy film and i can understand why they have a cult following. so, despite falling sleep (i think it was that fake butter on my popcorn), i would recommend this film to others. this film sparked my interest in the firefly series. i'm not qualified to form a thorough opinion of this film but i definitely will make a point of watching this again. serenity picked up steam and what i saw in the second half i really enjoyed. what i saw was quirky and original. that's good enough for me.OK. i watched it again. there were some memorable lines: ""what's going on here?"" ya, like i know. ""yes no yes no yes"" sure, oookay. "" back up. we need back up"". you're not kidding...you mean because of all the dessicated bodies? the reevers? or is that, reavers? ""is she a weapon or is she more than that?"" you're asking me? ""what happened here?"" ah, pardon? ""shut this off!"" oh, the irony. the ships were great and reminded me of things even a bathe-scope couldn't see. would i watch this again? believe it or not, yes. i'd like to watch the entire film from beginning to end without drifting off again. the confused crew were fun and had some good chemistry, although some of the acting by a female crew person wasn't great. and River was pretty good. the sociopath baddie was very focused. i liked this film more the second time, and i may like it more when i watch it again...""did you hear that?""OK! I have finally watched Serenity from beginning to end, and i am a fan! i have this film now in my collection! i still think that one female crew member, who didn't want to die because she wanted sex, was a bad actor, but this is nit-picking! i loved the leader of the renegades, and even the ""bad guy"" found some redemption when he was confronted with the truth. also, this film made big pharma look really bad, which isn't a stretch at all, which i just loved. paxil. Hahaha!! this film rocked for me, but only after re-watching it several times.no, it didn't wear me down. it turned me into a fan!",Serenity
209,rbsjrx,Great - accessible and character-driven,10,1 October 2005,"First of, I readily admit I'm a Firefly fan - not a Josh Whedon fan, but a Firefly fan. Having said that, I firmly believe you needn't ever have seen the TV series to enjoy this movie.Even though most reviews have been positive, I'd like to start out by addressing the negative comments... The first is that it will only appeal to fans of the TV series. As stated above, I don't believe this to be the case and what little feedback I've heard from non-fans has borne out this assumption. Secondly, some have criticized the budget and FX. I'd argue that big budgets aren't necessary to a good SF movie and often get in the way (think George Lucas). In Serenity, there was only one scene, lasting maybe 2 seconds, where the CGI was clearly showing and not up to par, but I can forgive that. The important part is that the FX/CGI are in the service of the script, rather than the other way around.Finally, let's talk performances... One of the thing that people most liked about Firefly was the quality and coherence of the ensemble cast. Wisely (or maybe not - remember the meager budget), Whedon resisted the temptation to toss in a few expensive ""big names"" to punch up the box office. The cast still clicks like a well-oiled machine. The audience can respond to their cohesiveness. We easily believe this wildly disparate group of people actually care about each other.*** Warning: Minor spoilers ahead ***More importantly, even the most reprehensible characters have redeeming qualities, dictated by their histories. There are no 2-dimensional wholly good or evil characters. Each has multiple aspects and layers that helps us believe that they're real people rather than archetypes. We may not approve of all of them, all the time, but we do understand them.For far too long, SF films and TV has been focused on action and FX. Even many of the classics (e.g. 2001) are emotionally sterile. Where character development was pursued, I found it often difficult to really care about them (e.g. Blade Runner). While the crew of Serenity might never be the sort of folks I'd seek out to hang around with, they are people I could respect and understand - even in their more questionable choices.I expect to see this at least twice more in the theater, and will then eagerly await the DVD release.Now, if they'd only make a Babylon 5 movie...",Serenity
210,Gatorman9,Really disappointing,5,30 March 2013,"God, this thing is pure cheese with extra cheese sauce. 7.9 IMDb rating? Fuggettaboutit. The dramatic side of it is about as appealing as the 1970's version of **Battlestar Galactica** -- maybe even less, in that it is even more juvenile. The characters are mostly clichéd -- post modern clichés, maybe, but clichéd -- and usually uninteresting (although it was nice to see a familiar if substantially aged face in Ron Glass again). The acting is generally soap-opera quality at best (except Ron Glass's, and to some extent, the villain's). The villain is probably the high point -- despite the predictability of the writing of his part, he is at least a bit interesting. The **Blade Runner** look is overemphasized. The actions sequences are OK but alone do not make a movie (if you are a grown-up, at least). On average, a James Bond movie is better made -- any James Bond movie. One interesting point, I couldn't help noticing every time he was on the screen that the actor who plays ""Wash"" bears a striking physical resemblance on film to a famous former United States naval officer named Richard H. O'Kane. O'Kane's claim to fame was that he was awarded the Medal of Honor for sinking approximately 30 Japanese ships as a submarine commander in World War Two. This was a real war which actually took place and finally ended in August, 1945. In addition to the Medal of Honor, O'Kane earned three Navy Crosses, three Silver Stars, the Legion of Merit with ""V"" device for valor, the Purple Heart and a number of other decorations for his total of ten actual war patrols. The awards were real, and O'Kane was a real person who sank the targets, which were real and not imaginary ships, from an actual historical vessel, the USS TANG (SS-306). The Medal of Honor was actually hung around his neck in an award ceremony at the actual White House in real-life Washington, D.C., by a President of the United States who actually existed named Harry Truman. Moreover, the TANG itself was actually sunk when the last torpedo it fired on its final war patrol proved defective and made a circular run, returning to strike the submarine in one of its engine rooms and killing all but nine men aboard, including O'Kane. They were fished out of the water by the Japanese, beaten, and thrown into a POW camp until the war was over about 10 months later. These were actual Japanese enemy fighting men who really existed, not movie characters. It was a real, not a fantasy, POW camp, and so were the beatings its guards dispensed. I wish somebody would have the good sense to make a contemporary movie about that.",Serenity
211,edblackham,Never saw Firefly,4,13 July 2020,"I guess that's a prerequisite. I really didn't care about the characters and I thought the story was mediocre at best. I was pretty bored, and I thought the special effects were below average. The special-effects were more like a TV series in a movie.",Serenity
212,james_corck3,Now looking for Firefly,10,27 May 2006,"We are not sure if cheer up or cheer down about the decision of cancel Firefly. If they didn't canceled it, we could had been enjoying that awesome TV series right now. But thanks to that we can enjoy this great, superior movie made with the heart more than with the wallet.Joss Whedon is what George Lucas should had been. And I am not going to say what he is because there is no available adjective yet for this fantastic film maker that goes beyond the boundaries of originality.OK, now to leave the cheese part of this review, is as simple as say that if they make me choose between this movie and any other Sci Fi ""spaceship-crew members-evil force in the shadow"" movie I choose this one. No doubt, few movies made me gave them the 10 stars treatment. Not even Alien got that high rate in my value scale.",Serenity
213,LadyLiberty,Serenity is everything that Firefly was and then some,8,2 October 2005,"All right, I confess: I never saw the TV series Firefly when it was originally broadcast on Fox. I never regretted it, either, until a friend of mind shamed me into watching the DVD of the series. Finally, I began to ""get it."" Firefly is entertaining in and of itself, but it's also pro-freedom as all get-out. When I heard that there was going to be a movie released, I could hardly bear to wait until it opened. That level of expectation can be bad. When they're that high, even a good movie can fail to measure up. So now I hope you'll understand just what high praise it is when I tell you that I wasn't disappointed in the least.The movie takes place about 500 years in the future when humanity has spread to other worlds. Unfortunately, it's taken some of its worst traits with it including the tendency of some to demand they be charged with the caretaking of the others. A powerful central government that calls itself the Alliance is spreading ""civilization"" to outlying worlds, and it will stop at nothing to continue its mission to subjugate various peoples ""for their own good."" One of its research and development programs involves the literal weaponization of human beings including 17 year-old River Tam (Summer Glau). Her older brother Simon (Sean Maher) manages to rescues her from the top secret facility where she's held, but much damage has already been done.Simon and River find temporary refuge aboard a privately owned transport ship named ""Serenity."" Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and his first mate Zoe (Gina Torres) are veterans of a failed war for independence. Their distaste for the Alliance and all it stands for makes them somewhat sympathetic to the Tams' predicament. What no one knows, though, is just how important River is to the Alliance and why; and they certainly are unaware of just how far the Alliance will go to get her back.Mal and his crew often cross the line between legal commerce and illegal smuggling, but they generally steer clear of the Alliance and manage to survive in relative freedom on the edges of known space. But the Alliance has assigned an Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to get River back for them, and he's both very, very good at his job and entirely ruthless. Although they still don't know the details of the danger they're in, Mal is quick to recognize that he's in trouble. So he rallies his crew and braves both Alliance forces and the horrifying Reavers who lie in wait for unsuspecting travelers in a search for answers and, he hopes, some way to survive all that is to come.To Firefly fans, the main characters in Serenity are old friends. It's truly a delight to see each and every one of them again. The good news is that, even if you don't ""know"" any of the group, just enough back story is included for you to jump right in and enjoy the movie as a stand alone tale.Joss Whedon, the creator, writer, and director of Firefly and Serenity, brings his unique touch to the story which makes the humor and the drama work in seamless ways that others likely couldn't manage. Though the actors are largely relatively unknown, the performances are uniformly good; given that Whedon isn't George Lucas and didn't have a Lucas budget at his disposal, the special effects are also impressive (an epic space battle involving countless ships in particular is just wonderful). There's some real drama, some horror, and moments of laugh-out-loud levity in Serenity. There's also an underlying and very important message: Freedom! That's a concept that too many take for granted and, as such, we are imminently threatened with losses of it every day. Films like Serenity may not change that, but at least we can hope that more will recognize what's happening as a result.Firefly fans will, of course, love Serenity. Science fiction fans should also be pleased. For those of you who are neither, Serenity still has something for you. There's mystery and love; there's suspense and horror. I recommend Serenity on many levels, not least of which is the fact it's a pretty darned good movie. (As an aside, I'm betting that many of you non-Firefly fans will like the movie well enough to check out the series, too.)POLITICAL NOTES: There's a line uttered by a young school girl near the beginning of Serenity that's positively haunting. When another child asks a teacher why it is that anybody would want to fight against a government that only wants what's best for them, the girl says, ""We're in their homes. We're in their heads. We're meddlesome, and we don't have the right."" Amen! And the horrors that ensue when the Alliance determines it can improve the lives of some of its citizens are truly frightening, and ought to serve as a warning that even the best motives can result in the very worst of unintended consequences.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Serenity is rated PG-13 for ""sequences of intense violence and action, and some sexual references."" The rating is probably about right given the graphic nature of a few violent scenes; your very youngest should probably stay at home. But slightly older children  even those 12 and 13 year-old kids who aren't old enough to be knowledgeable about politics or government  should enjoy the battle scenes quite a bit (both those in outer space and those in convenient outer limits bars). Meanwhile, those able to understand the political undercurrent will get far more than mere enjoyment out of the film, or at least I hope they will. I saw Serenity twice this weekend; I hope every one of you will see it at least once. The worst that can happen is that you'll be entertained, but in the best possible world, you'll also come away with a new and personal appreciation for liberty.",Serenity
214,Surecure,An excellent film... this coming from somebody who is not a die-hard Joss Whedon fan,8,2 October 2005,"First off, I'm not one of those guys who goes ga-ga over everything that Joss Whedon makes. I never got into Buffy (and Angel by extension) and I'm generally not a big fan of writers who feel the need to inject humour into everything. I in fact didn't get into Firefly until the DVD came out and I found it on sale fairly inexpensively. I gave it a shot since so many people said it was great and was won over with how well crafted the series was.Serenity is everything that was good about Firefly maxxed out, and impressively it was made in such a way that one does not have to be a Firefly fan in order to understand or enjoy it. The story was excellent, the writing was top-notch, the performances were very entertaining and the action sequences were thrilling. While Whedon's directing skills could use some minor improvements on, the overall presentation of the film shows a group of people who love what they are doing and put everything into it.This film will not disappoint any fan of swashbuckling entertainment or space-operas. With some minor improvements the film could have been a 9 easily (I reserve votes of a 10 for genius films like the Godfather), but I give it an 8 for being as wonderfully entertaining as it was.",Serenity
215,NotMoreMovies,It never had a fair chance for many reasons!,9,30 July 2006,"First I'll discuss why this movie and the series failed, then I'll give my review.I must first admit, I'm a fan of Joss's work, but I'm not ""insane"" over it, so I don't instantly think everything he touches is gold.When this movie's derivative series (Firefly) first came out, I was not impressed by the ads I saw on TV and subsequently never tuned in to give it a chance. I'm NOT kicking myself over that decision, because it was advertised so poorly that it truly didn't look interesting to the casual observer. This combined with the fact that the basis for the show doesn't APPEAR interesting at first glance. This show (for a sci-fi fantasy) is...how should I say...too realistic! This show was also written far too dark and serious for most people to handle in a sci-fi show. I don't think most people were ready to handle this level of realism in anything but a reality show...and this movie is even more dark and realistic than the series. There's still plenty of jokes and humor interlaced into the script to lighten the mood at just the right time, so don't think it's all ""gloom and doom."" :) I became interested in Serenity when I saw its trailer, so I told my friend to watch for it. He told me that it came from the series Firefly and he hated that Fox canceled that show. I then took it upon myself to watch every episode with an open mind. Unlike most series, which start out awful, this series was brilliant! The cast played off each other perfectly, the guest stars always did an excellent job, and not a single script seemed too extravagant.The movie is a perfect send-off to the series. It explains many things about the cast (especially River) that the series never had a chance to lead into gradually. It also reveals many things about the true nature and objectives of the Alliance.Again I must highly praise the guest star. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays the part of the part of the Alliance operative perfectly. He's not a ""bad guy"" per say, but he is so loyal to the Alliance that he will do anything to complete his objective. I would dare say he plays one of the best antagonists I've seen in a long time, and he does it perfectly. Almost as good as Hopkins played Hannibal Lecter.The plot in a nutshell is...the Alliance is afraid that River has classified knowledge locked in her brain--knowledge that could drastically hurt their hold on the population if it came to light. They send the Operative (Ejiofor) to find her at any cost and bring her in dead or alive. He tries to find her by activating the latent combat knowledge in her brain, making her dangerous enough that no one would want to get near her, but instead it also unlocks the classified information she absorbed. She leads the crew of the Serenity to a planet on the outer edge of the solar system that is surrounded by insane cannibal humans known as reavers. There they discover proof of the secret that the Alliance dreaded all along. The only question is, how can they spread the news before the Operative and the Alliance catch up with them? If they can, they might just save River's life and strike a blow against the Alliance at the same time.This is a near-flawless movie. The script was well written, the acting was always believable, and the philosophies were as well implemented as those in Lord of the Rings.I must conclude by saying that if this movie had the budget of the Star Wars or Lord of the Rings movies, or if the series had the resources of the Star Trek franchise, it would have started a whole new widespread genre. Just remember, this show was canceled after one season but fan support was enough to green-light a movie! No other rapidly canceled series can claim that! This is probably the end of the road for this genre, but I'm still hopeful for more.",Serenity
216,marimbadaddy,Excellent Sci-fi Romp,8,16 March 2008,"I never heard of Firefly, the TV series on which this film is based. Not having seen the TV show didn't effect my enjoyment at all. The script was excellent, with a good plot, great characters with depth, and a constantly moving flow. The film is solid enough without the TV show as you get to know the characters and 'world' they live in.The film had great special effects, but balanced out with the dialog, and plot development. Serenity also features good cinematography and sound editing.Having seen this movie, I'm looking forward to watching the TV show which was canceled after only 14 episodes.",Serenity
217,FilmCreature,FilmCreature Reviews 'Serenity',10,29 July 2007,"I loved Serenity. Loved it loved it loved it. I had never even watched Firefly before, and I just positively, completely fell in love with this movie. Its characters, its humor, action, suspense...Of course, I watched Firefly later, and very much liked it, but the movie blew me away. I wanted to watch it again immediately after seeing it. Nathan Fillion makes Mal into an extremely likable captain hero whom we want to succeed. We care for Zoe, the hardy pilot's wife, we care for River, the disturbed psychic, we especially care for Jewel Staite's Kaylee, the ultra-likable engineer who just wants the doc to love her.Serenity is very funny, and very suspenseful. Joss Whedon does a marvelous job in both areas, cracking jokes and bringing in his cannibalistic pals, the Reaver, when a stunning action scene is necessary.Yeah, I think I liked Serenity a little too much, but its charm was too much to resist. I said that the best episodes of Firefly were written by Joss Whedon, well, here's one giant episode written by him! It's a Firefly fan's dream come true! And mine as well. This is my favorite movie of all time. 4/4",Serenity
218,NewDivide1701,More than for Firefly fans,9,2 October 2005,"Coming from someone who has never seen the Firefly series, this movie was excellent. Brings forth the whole situation right away so that people can get right into the movie. And still brings forth the whole mind bending question. Excellent character development without having to see the series from the beginning.Though many of the ""shock"" scenes were not that shocking (the reason for the 9 instead of 10), a lot of the camera angles and movements can make you dizzy enough as though you were watching the Blair Witch Project. Action, comedy, sci-fi all wrapped up into one successful package.The Firefly saga, from where the movie was based, can be compared to the Star Trek franchise. Star Trek ended after 3 seasons due to poor scheduling. Put in a time slot where where most of the people who would love to watch it couldn't. But came back, started as a movie, and then a franchise, which included 9 sequels and 4 spin-offs, that lasted 39 years.As with Star Trek, Firefly (from second hand knowledge) was also a victim of poor scheduling due to the laughable intelligence of the network. A series that would be best viewed in sequence was aired out of sequence, because they wanted the high power action first. And therefore no one would be able to appreciate it until it came out on DVD and reruns.And now with Serenity, Firefly might follow in the steps of Star Trek in a limited way. Though there might not be a ""Firefly: The Next Generation,"" or any other spin off (at least a decent one), but if it can maintain the level of quality as the first movie, there will be a sequel, perhaps a trilogy, and then maybe installments afterwards.If anything, Serenity might turn someone, who is not a Firefly fan, into one.",Serenity
219,sullibrandon,It's a shame this movie flopped at the box-office,8,26 March 2006,"It always makes me want to yell at filmmakers or studios who completely drop the ball when it comes to excellent movies, as they did with Serenity. This movie had the potential to take its place among the sci-fi greats, but the studios failed miserably at giving it the advertising push it deserved....except for brief TV spots I personally had never heard of Serenity...the only reason I saw it (on DVD) was because a couple of critics I tend to agree with really really liked it. So I never saw the show. But I loved the movie. I guess I'm not a Firefly fan.Serenity's story is nothing new. The Earth, years in the future, is overpopulated, so as a result we must go out and colonize other worlds to support human life. Obviously we've heard of this sort of scenario before, or variations on it. But what makes Serenity special is a great cast, great special effects, and a great twist on an old premise.The cast, who worked together on the shamefully canceled Firefly TV series, is also in the movie - and you can tell that they've been working together - they instantly work as a crew in the movie, they don't need time to make themselves believable and to grow together. Everybody's performance is just right - including the villain. They just ...work.As for the good special effects...this movie had a budget of between 30 and 35 million. For such a minuscule budget, the special effects look amazingly good. Heck, even when put in comparison with other big budget space movies, such as Star Wars - the ships in Serenity could hold a candle to them. They looked REAL. The space battles were mind-blowing and amazing eye candy.As for the story, it wasn't so much that it was a brand new story, it was the spice of humor, a sort of light-heartedness that was added to the story, to make these characters lovable and believable. Personally, I've found that when war movies or big fighting space movies try to insert humor into their dialogue, it comes off as incredibly cheesy and fairly unnecessary. In Serenity, however, the dialogue WORKS. It is smart, as well. Sharp, witty, and intelligent one-liners are seamlessly integrated into the script without seeming pasted or slapped on as in most movies like this. The way the story had a sort of twist half - way through, but not the sort of twist that undoes the movie in its attempt at being amazing, was pretty cool too. I also liked the kind of clunky feel of a lot of technology in the movie. This isn't the polished titanium of Star Trek. It hearkens back to the sort of rudimentary metallic pistol that Harrison Ford carried in BladeRunner. The guns, weapons, and ships in Serenity FEEL real, because a lot of it is - it's practical and realistic, in terms of what might be real fifty or so years from now.However, Serenity does suffer from some various clichés that usually abound in sci-fi movies. It does not completely reinvent the sci-fi genre, or add anything spectacularly new to it - like films like BladeRunner, the Matrix, and Star Wars have done. Serenity is just, simply, a great sci-fi flick with a lot of solid action and a well thought-out plot behind it. And a little humor thrown into the mix as well.",Serenity
220,LaurieMann,"Definitely Worthwhile, Mostly Good Acting, a Few Glitches",9,2 September 2005,"While I wasn't a huge fan of Firefly when it was on TV, I became more of a fan while watching the DVD with all of the episodes in the correct order.The Serenity movie is mostly quite strong and impressive. I think the space battle near the end is the best I've ever seen (I preferred it to Sith's space battles). I'm not sure if it completely works or not; while the acting is generally quite good, Sean Maher (Simon) is all over the place, and Nathan Fillion (Mal) had trouble in his early scenes. However, he does have some strong scenes, particularly with Ron Glass (Shepard).I particularly adore the women - Zoe (the terrific Gina Torres), Inara (Morena Baccarin) and Kaylee (Jewel Staite) and they were generally well-used. I was worried by the trailer since they hardly appear in the trailer, but, luckily, they really appeared in the movie. I've also always enjoyed the wonderful ""opposites attract"" chemistry that Zoe and Wash (Alan Tudyk) have, and that's also well-played in the movie. Joss Whedon's TV casting translated very well to the big screen.Often when a TV show becomes a movie, usually the plot revolves around some secret. Sometimes the ""secret"" revealed is kind of silly. The secret at the heart of this movie is a doozy and it really worked for me (though, since seeing the movie, I've been rewatching the series on DVD, and it's virtually mentioned in the series but kind of in passing).The main weakness in this movie is some confusion around the end, and a stupidly choreographed fight scene at the climax. There's a scene that's supposed to be quite dramatic, but all I could think of was the Galaxy Quest ""This episode is badly written!!"" scene, so it was inadvertently funny. Additionally, there's kind of a deus ex machina moment near the end that's irritating.However, I think these things could be fixed before the movie is formally released this fall. This movie has so much going for it - superb cast chemistry, a well-formed, ""lived in"" future, jaw-dropping but not overused special effects and mostly intelligent writing. I'll be curious to go back after its released and see how it was tweaked.",Serenity
221,pwoods1,OK. I give up. The series wasn't THAT bad...,8,27 February 2006,"I wrote a negative review for Firefly: and, I guess, that I have to take that review back (with reservations). Still, it's out there, and one out of four people found it acceptable.Serenity, however, is NOT Firefly 'the series'. What seemed, at first viewing, pretty hokey, comes together in this feature film.It took my daughter to point out that I had 'missed the plot' (re Firefly) completely. She also made me watch Serenity. I enjoyed it immensely! Josh Whedon's script and therefore the dialogue is as cutting and clever as it is in all his productions/directorial outings.The characters are three-dimensional and believable: they are all 'feet-of-clay' non-heroes; human/humanoids engaging in what we humans do: attempt to make a 'killing' monetarily and retire for life. Still...Serenity is a lot of fun whilst suggesting sub-plots. And isn't that what SF/fantasy is all about? What happens now?",Serenity
222,tkell31,Movie making elevated to an art form,10,25 March 2020,"It's so rare to see these days where every line matters, ever gesture, look and movement has purpose. Well crafted characters, a detailed plot with multiple subplots woven seamlessly through it. This isnt so much a review as my offer of thanks to all involved in the creation. If you enjoy well thought out movies, with some quirky moments that dont overwhelm or spoil the overall theme do yourself a favor and check this, and Firefly, out.Very few movies/TV shows make me sad that we never got more, but this is one of those cases. Sometimes less is more as the magic doesnt get diluted, but the consistently high level that this story is told makes me think we missed out by only getting one season and one movie. But imagination elevated to this level is art all its own. Enjoy.",Serenity
223,soger,Another lame sci-fi,4,19 April 2008,"I personally like sci-fi movies because they can make you wonder about the endless possibilities of our universe. But not this movie. I wonder how it can have a rating of 8...The only thing that makes this movie a ""sci-fi"" is that it happens in the future and we are shown some fancy spaceships. But when the movie ends you are left with nothing. I wonder if I will remember this movie in one week because fancy spaceships aside it is just another junk action movie with a super-girl and some big talks that are supposed to rise emotions in the viewer.Seriously, I don't get what people like in this movie. I read some comments marked ""Loved it"", for example someone said ""You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll gasp in shock. What you won't be is bored."" When? I did not cry, I did not laugh, I did not gasp into shock but I WAS BORED! All I could see was some people shooting at each other with some big guns. Well, if this is what you want, you better watch a good old Van Damme or Stallone movie.The only thing I agree with the people from the ""Loved it"" section is the CGI. They are okay but for example the guys from Stargate Atlantis do a lot better job. Still... good visual effects are not enough to make a good sci-fi. In my opinion this movie has no value at all.If you like Andromeda maybe you will also like this movie too but if you are a Star Trek or a Stargate fan you probably want to skip this movie.",Serenity
224,wlb,Better Late To The Party Than Never Going...,8,9 April 2009,"A friend of mine introduced me to Firefly in 2009, 7 years after it was canceled by Fox. After seeing the 16 episodes on DVD I have to say that Fox really didn't know what they had, and stuck it in a bad time slot. Serenity is a continuation of the series, and answers many questions fans had during the series' short run. Personally I have to say this is one of the most innovative science fiction movies - series and movie - that I have ever seen. Why? Because so much of the past is seamlessly integrated with the future. To me I can't separate the series from the movie. As one example (in the series) imagine a gun fight with both pistols from the 1800s and ray guns - or going to a party with a 17th century minuet. The advice my friend gave to me about the movie is - (if you are a Firefly novice) - watch the movie first. Then watch the series. Then watch the movie again. Either one can stand on its own but together the movie means that much more. Does Kaylee ever get together with Simon - or Inara with Mal? What an outstanding imagination Joss has - and with the cancellation of the series it told me that as a screenwriter or actor quality sometimes has nothing to do with a series success or failure on the TV. Firefly deserved better. If you want to see some innovative Science Fiction, see either but it this movie is best seen with knowledge of the series. Or you can enjoy it on its own.",Serenity
225,tonywebster-96090,Serenity,9,14 August 2020,"This one of best science fiction films made. The plot and writing are expectional. Character development has been well thought out. Where star trek never went, serenity dared to venture.",Serenity
226,mjarvis0,After this there must be a sequel or revive the TV show!!,10,2 March 2006,"I originally came across the fore runner to Serenity (the TV show Firefly) via rumour. I bought the series on DVD and within a few minutes of watching it, I knew I would like it. Actually I do not like it, I love it. So it was a natural progression for me to buy the DVD of the film Serenity. I watched and it is excellent!! The writer provides continuity from the TV series to the motion picture and at the same time provides a film that those who have never seen firefly can follow with ease. I do not want to give away too much of the plot but I will say that it involves the Government attempting to apprehend an extremely gifted girl and the reasons why they want her so badly become clear. This film is excellent because it is not sugar coated. All the main characters do not survive (I will not say which ones) and indeed by the end of the film all that do survive are definitely the worse for wear. But that is realism and what makes this film a classic. The main characters do not just get 'winged' they are really hurt. I found this a great film, one that I will be watching again and again and it is my fervent hope that there is a sequel or at the very least the TV company that cancelled the Firefly series will get on their knees to Joss Whedon (the creator of Firefly) and ask him to do another TV series.",Serenity
227,Osmiumos,Excellent - who did the soundtrack?,9,1 October 2020,"Great job tying all the loose ends in a story that revolves around Whedon's consistent theme of unnecessarily meddlesome central authorities desire to control the population, even at the extremities of interplanetary civilisation.
This insight stretches back to early space opera science fiction writing and earlier genres.
I am amused by reviewers who proclaim ""plot holes"" and confusion.
I think the story holds together well and nothing was confusing for me.
Who did the soundtrack? It is uncredited on IMDB, and it is excellent.",Serenity

230,Vishal_s_kumar,One of the best science fiction films you've never seen.,8,28 October 2009,"From the mind of the revered writer Joss Whedon comes Serenity, the theatrical followup to the critically acclaimed but ratings-challenged television show ""Firefly."" Serenity's path to theaters is a strange one, indeed. Most film adaptations of television material tend to come from shows that enjoyed mass popularity and high ratings. That was not the case with ""Firefly."" The show, while being lauded as a masterpiece of serialized science fiction, floundered on the Fox network and found cancellation a mere 11 episodes into its debut season. Strong DVD sales and a very vocal fan base convinced Universal Pictures to option the film rights to the series in the hopes that the show's numerous and outspoken fans could turn a relatively low-budget sci-fi adventure into an unexpected box-office hit. Much like the series, Serenity didn't quite meet expectations in theaters. The film received positive reviews and fans of the original show were thrilled with the film, but the mass audiences that Universal had hoped for never materialized. Serenity has performed well on video, but it seems likely that this single film is the last we'll hear from the characters that inhabit this beautifully conceived universe.Captain Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) has a problem: A tightwad of a young Doctor, Simon Tam (Sean Maher), and his awkward and secretive sister, River (Summer Glau), have made a home among the crew of his spaceship, Serenity. Mal runs a tight outfit smuggling goods across interstellar boundaries and under the nose of the meddling Interplanetary Alliance. Unfortunately for Mal, his two newest crewmembers attract a lot of unwanted attention. When River unexpectedly goes berserk in the middle of a smuggling deal, Mal is forced to investigate her bizarre behavior as well as the shadowy government henchman, The Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor), who has been sent to find her. The fate of the entire crew of the Serenity hangs in the balance as they face the deadliest foe they've ever encountered.Serenity is a rare film in that it surpasses the greatness of its source, ""Firefly,"" while being accessible to viewers unfamiliar with the original show. Whedon has done a fantastic job in setting up his characters and the basic plot of the show while using a minimum of screen time. By the time the first ten minutes of the film have passed, any viewer, regardless of their familiarity with the TV show, should possess enough information about the characters, society and universe presented in the show, to feel totally comfortable enjoying the film. It is the the unique character of Whedon's efficient and well timed writing that separates Serenity from television adaptations like X Files: Fight the Future.Whedon's outstanding talents as a writer and creative force bring Serenity a unique old west feel that approaches the lofty heights of true space opera. His vision for the film is huge and he's unafraid to tell a large story through the eyes of a small group of likable renegades. Every character is sharply drawn with a distinct personality and purpose. I've always been intrigued by how Whedon seems unafraid to be boundlessly optimistic in his writing. A character like Kaylee (Jewel Staite), with her inexplicably cherry demeanor and positive outlook on even the most dire events, would seem ridiculous in just about any other world. But within the Whedon-verse, she's the perfect compliment and balance to more serious characters like Mal and Jaybe Cobb (Adam Baldwin). In general, there is a considerable amount of levity and humor to Serenity that allows for Whedon's unique writing timbre to develop freely from the characters.Serenity is a unique and highly entertaining film that will thrill fans of the original show while, no doubt, creating new fans eager to seek out the original ""Firefly."" Serenity is recommended.",Serenity
231,Bevan - #4,I simply loved it.,10,10 January 2007,"Caveat: I am a huge fan of the TV show, and so I came with a preconception of the relationships between the characters and the backstory. Probably I'd have been less thrilled walking into the movie cold. That being said ...Wow. Alright, I've seen Whedon's other works, but what struck me hardest about this movie was the rare sense that you couldn't count on how far the director would dare to take it. By the time Wash had been added to the body count, with Kaylee and Simon shot and River grabbed by reavers, I defy any moviegoer to claim that he or she didn't have that cold feeling in the pit of their stomachs: *that NO one would make it out alive.* It's desperately uncommon to take that into the climax of a film, and major props to Joss for managing it; it's the hinge of my defending the film to the outraged Zoe-and-Wash fanfic crowd. Beyond that, I applaud how they pulled off making tiny little Summer Glau look genuinely credible wiping the floor with small hordes of enemies.I'll address the fanboys so far as this: a persistent complaint is that certain characters were reduced to little better than cameos. No kidding ... is anyone really under the delusion that each and every Firefly ep saw full exposition and screen time for each and every crew member? Of course not; the episodes focused on certain characters depending on who was most important to the plot. So did Serenity. I'm sorry that Joss didn't script the exact movie each and every one of you individually wanted, complete with focus on the characters you yourselves like best, but that's a common complaint in every such fandom situation.10/10.",Serenity
232,michaeljharvey,"A bit overrated, but still better than the recent Star Wars movies",6,13 December 2008,"At the time I'm writing this, Serenity has achieved a lofty 8.0 ranking on IMDb. This seems a little generous, given that overall this is just another decently-made sci-fi film.Serenity shares many elements with sci-fi films you've seen before, but seems to take a lot of inspiration from Star Wars in particular. The captain of the Serenity is a Hans Solo type character, a true space cowboy. The plot revolves around rebels fighting an ""evil alliance"". Sound familiar? True to form, there are the requisite epic space battles. The Serenity is an out-dated, beat-up old ship but she always comes through when it counts. Sort of like the Millennium Falcon? All of the familiar, broad, sci-fi themes are explored: good vs. evil, truth vs. lies, freedom vs. oppression.Despite the lack of originality, Serenity is far more successful than the recent Star Wars movies. The dialogue is occasionally snappy and doesn't take itself too seriously for the most part. We even have characters that are involving, likable and inspire loyalty. This is a sharp contrast to the wooden, over-written characters George Lucas has forced upon us in his recent films. The special effects are a little cheap looking at times, but at least they compliment the story rather than dominating it.As for the plot, it's a mixed bag of sci-fi clichés. There's a mousy, psychic girl who's sort of a ""chosen one"" or ""savior"". The evil alliance wants her back because she holds a terrible secret that could destroy their carefully-controlled universe. The rebel crew of the Serenity must protect her secret because, well, there wouldn't be much of a movie if they didn't. There are also some space-zombie, barbarian-type bad guys called ""Reavers"" that end up playing a surprisingly key role in the plot. The idea of mindless zombies piloting high-tech space ships seems debatable at best, but I guess you can't force too much logic on a sci-fi story.Serenity is worth watching, but don't expect genius or stunning originality. This is not an all-time, sci-fi classic like The Matrix or Aliens. It's just a nice, forgettable tale that will reasonably involve you for a couple of hours.",Serenity
233,tomsawyer-01858,Careful about Series conversions,2,25 April 2015,"First off, when I bought the DVD, I didn't know about a TV series, I never watch series(except one), all these relationship stories and small talk, it's a waste of my precious time, and that's what the movie is about in the first hour. After almost a decade, I never managed to watch this movie to the end, and there are only very few of them, less then a dozen.I'm trying now again, maybe in three evenings in a row, I tried that before, but it didn't work. Finally I managed to watch to the end, so many irrational childish decisions from the characters, unimaginable from a crew supposed to survive in space. Our youngest boy scouts wouldn't react so emotionally.About the rating. It doesn't say anything about the quality of the movie, who has absolutely no depth, in atmosphere, in directing, in acting, in locations, in the plot, in characters, in the script.It's all wannabe to a superficial dead end.This movie made me check for more, and I noticed that too much stuff resulting from series is overrated in the IMDb.People get emotionally attached to their characters of beloved series, who get a daily presence in their family. I enjoy Dark Angel, just for the voice of Jessica Alba in my living room ;-).But this should not alter their perception of what a TV Episode (and Serenity) is : less, in terms of length of scripts, than low budget B movies, much small talk and moody relationships between characters, to keep time running and hide simple plots, to capture us on a daily 30 minutes link to TV to get enlightened by advertisements.",Serenity
234,TensersFloatingDisk,Justifies the T.V. series,8,3 February 2006,"I'd like to have seen Serenity without having any previous knowledge of the T.V. series. But, as with pretty much everyone else, that's an impossibility.The ""Firefly"" series was...well, it was disjointed. Fragmentary. The melding of western and space-opera genres already made this a rocky ride, and the complex backstory made it even rockier. Joss Whedon's dialogue, always spot on, was unable to overcome some real problems with over-burdened sub-plot-heavy episodes. Some of the characters, like the shepard, simply took up space.So it got canned. But then it was raised from the ashes as ""Serenity,"" and fans rejoiced. Was it worth it? Sure. Is it the second-coming of science fiction? Well, no. Gone are a lot of the heavy-handed westernisms, and Whedon's gift for dialogue shines through all the better for it. The cast has been trimmed (good) and gets trimmed even further over the course of the film (even better). Best of all, Serenity provides what the series never did: a single, coherent story-arc. It's a worthy film. It's worthy of a sequel. Worthy of a resurrection for the Firefly series? Well....let's give it some time, shall we? 8/10",Serenity
235,anifanmc,A fantastic series finale,8,21 February 2008,"Firefly is one of the few science fiction shows that, when i picked it up for the first time, truly broke the mold for me. No elaborate and unnecessary space battles, no lightsabers, and most intriguingly of all, no aliens. It featured a unique but recognizable culture. I was disappointed to see it go, but the coming of Serenity as a film was more than what I expected.For fans of the show, Serenity will be a treat, almost like icing on the cake. It features the same recognizable eponymous ship, the crew, the captain, and the environment which they saw on the show. Malcolm Reynolds (Fillion) does his character justice in the film, revealing more of his softer side and his embattled, righteous side while keeping him as the brigand that he is; Zoey is ever the loyal copilot with her husband Washburn at her side; Kaylee (Staite) is still the lovable and sweet mechanic; and most notably, River Tam (Summer Glau), the psychic (and often psychotic) younger sister of Simon Tam (Maher), with a sweetness and sympathy that draws the audience, shows her true colors and the story comes full circle.The story itself remains simple, just like the show. On a routine job, Simon becomes fed up with the crew and decides to leave, like Enara (Baccarin) before him, due to the captain's taking advantage of River's psychic powers. She's triggered by the Alliance, still looking for her, into singlehandedly taking down an entire bar barehanded. Confused and frightened, River reveals that she knows of a planet which holds the key to the worst atrocity ever committed by the Alliance. Mal decides to make a final stand against the oppressive government and reveal to the people of the worlds the horrifying truth they have discovered.Firefly fans aside, the common sci fi moviegoer will enjoy this. It has action, drama, comedy, and for the movie watcher not inclined towards sci fi, it has loads of culture. A must-see.",Serenity
236,matjusm,Awesome,9,16 April 2006,"First of all I have to say that I've never seen a single episode of the Firefly TV series that this was based on but that didn't take away from my enjoyment of this film.Somewhere in the future when humans have colonized large parts of the universe, we are introduced to a young girl who's psychic and other powers make her of great value to the government. To hide from them, she and her brother hide out with a crew up mercenaries and their spaceship named 'Serenity'.Even though none of the actors in this film seemed familiar to me, the chemistry they had together created a nice atmosphere. Writer/director Joss Whedon has included a good deal of witty dialog in the script but it never takes center stage or dives into absurdity.Joss Whedon, despite being a first time director, does an impressive job with directing the action bringing us some great hand to hand combat, shootouts and chases with spaceships. The cinematography is also pretty good, featuring some nice steadicam shots following the characters as they move about the ship. What I found quite satisfying was that unlike many other films, they managed to keep the camera stable during the action scenes in this film so you can enjoy each fight to the fullest.The only slight downside to this film is that sometimes the story gets a little too 'above your head' and it feels like we're supposed to know some stuff that they don't tell us in the film. The CGI here looks like it is better fit for a TV series than a film but considering the budget they had, they sure did a very impressive job and it fortunately doesn't take away from the experience.Overall a very good and entertaining film.",Serenity

Why in the world so original movie should struggle in the box office? Maybe the characters are too real, too developed, and logical. Maybe the humor was too sharp and witty, refreshingly funny for a change, but well balanced with the drama not overshadowing each other.

238,galahad58,It was Serenity,10,30 September 2005,"First, I will start off by writing that I will not give any type of spoiler information in this summary. This will be a summary of the film and it's contents and my point of view only. I do wish to give a brief acknowledgement of Firefly, the series that spawned this movie. While you do not have to have seen an episode of Firefly to enjoy this film, I recommend seeing the series so that you get the full impact of everything that happens. For example, you did not have to see Star Trek to enjoy the Star Trek movies, but when things happened to the characters it was more dramatic to have been a fan who watched the characters grow throughout the series. Serenity follows the crew from the end of the series. Like I had mentioned, you did not have to see the series to understand and follow the movie. It does make it more profound if you do see the series. Sales pitch: it is on DVD at Best Buy or at Blockbuster. Serenity is one of the finest science fiction movies ever made. It is well scripted (much much better than that George Lucas garbage), it is intelligent (again better than that Lucas fellow), it has more depth to character (do I have to compare to the poor screenwriter Lucas again?), the dialog makes sense (--nevermind you get the point), and the story flows at a nice even pace. The acting is wonderful. It is acting you would see from more seasoned film performers. Yes, I enjoyed the performances on Firefly, but TV actors usually do not do as well on the big screen for some reason. The acting is fantastic (for a sci-fi movie). Nathan Fillon is terrific as Malcolm Reynolds. While he was good on the series, he is better in the movie. Fillon grabs the Reynolds character by the throat and lets loose with everything he has within him. This is a performance that will, and could, put him in leading man status. It is good for Fillon, but if Firefly returns to TV, will he? His performance may open doors that would block the way for Firefly to return with him at the helm. This is Josh Whedon's debut as a film director. Most people probably held their breaths to see how he would perform on his first project. Well, I cheer. Great direction, great editing, great storytelling---Whedon gets a mighty A+ for this movie. This is also the movie where River goes from a minor character to a leading role. Another reason to watch the series since her transformation becomes more of an impact if you are familiar with her character. Love this movie---see it----do not expect Shakespeare, but expect one of the finest films that will entertain you. Entertainment and storytelling at it's peak.",Serenity
239,brainofj72,The Little Movie That Could,7,18 October 2005,"""Firefly"" was just about the biggest cult sci-fi TV program since ""Star Trek"". Of course, the thick-skulled FOX canceled it after a very brief run due to low ratings (largely due to the fact that it had a terrible time-slot). However, its fan base did not just roll over and die, and what a rowdy fan base it is. In a surprising and respectable move, FOX gave ""Firefly""'s creator Joss Whedon a chance to make a feature film from the series. The result was Serenity.The film's title refers to the name of a spaceship crewed by Mal (Fillion), the heroic captain; Jayne (Baldwin), the ""tough guy""; Wash (Tudyk), the red-headed pilot; Zoe (Torres), the assertive female; and Kaylee (Staite), the very horny female technician. The plot is not an easy one to summarize, but it involves a young girl (Glau) who is also a finely-tuned government weapon, a group of grotesque cannibalistic creatures called Reavers, and a massive political conspiracy/cover-up.I have actually never seen an episode of ""Firefly"", but I can tell that it, like Serenity, is one of a kind. Have you ever seen a science fiction western? I sure haven't. (And no, Star Wars doesn't count.) Whedon's writing and direction are just plain fun. His amusing characters offer plenty of funny and entertaining interactions, making for some hilarious dialogue and situations here and there.However, Serenity is not just mindless sci-fi fun. There is a palpable sense of sadness running throughout, and I must say, it greatly enhances the film. It is hard define this exactly, and I'm not going to bother trying. I'll let you see for yourself.One thing I particularly appreciated was a certain scene later in the film in which the ragtag crew of Serenity explores a highly developed yet mysteriously desolate and deserted planet. In order to avoid spoilers, I won't go into details, but I'll just say that Whedon masterfully establishes a truly unnerving atmosphere.Another thing I, and I'm sure many others, appreciated even more were several impressively gutsy, convention-defying plot decisions Whedon made toward the end of the film. Again, to avoid spoilers, I won't reveal them. You'll know what I'm referring to when you see the film.And yet another thing I greatly appreciated was that Whedon did not make Serenity a cookie-cutter PG-13 action movie. While it is rated PG-13, the violence is about as harsh as one's liable to find under said rating. The writing, for the most part, avoids rating clichés and the film does not feel tailored to the teenage demographic. It's nice to be treated with intelligence for a change.However, the one pervasive detriment that keeps Serenity in the B range for me was that I couldn't help but feel that I was watching a made-for-television movie. A well-made and thoroughly entertaining TV movie, but a TV movie nonetheless.Not many could have predicted just how successful Serenity has turned out to be, making good box office and already finding a spot in the IMDb top 250. While I can't deny that I find it overrated, I still would not hesitate to recommend Serenity: the little movie that could.8/10",Serenity

It's not 2001 after all. It's better than Star Trek which itself is better than the vastly over-rated Star Wars.

242,jon2005,Serenity,8,22 May 2006,"Serenity is based on Joss Whedon's (Buffy, Angel) television series Firefly, an odd concoction of sci-fi adventure with a western mindset. It is set around a group of mercenary types who, in order to get paid, will take any job that is available and because the ship's captain, Malcolm Reynolds, was on the losing side of a civil war, those jobs tend to be more on the illegal side, to keep away from the Alliance who governs the human star systems.Firefly was excellent; it was a very fresh take on the sci-fi genre, mixing different themes (the aforementioned western mindset with some Chinese influences here and there) and abstaining with the idea of aliens altogether  there's only humans in this universe. Coupled with some witty dialogue and likable characters (which was what drove the series, not showy effects) Whedon was on to a winner. Just when it was beginning to expand, after just 13 episodes, the network cancelled it; and it had so much potential to last a good few years. However, after much lobbying from fans, Firefly was given another chance, this time on the big screen. And Joss Whedon has once again excelled himself.Let's not beat around the bush  if you are a fan of Firefly, then Serenity will be everything you could want from its resurrection. If you're a beginner, then there will still be plenty enough for you to enjoy. The characters are introduced again with skill  not too much for those of us who already know them inside out, but enough so that those who don't will learn all about them very quickly.The plot cannot really be explained that fully without giving a lot of it away, but it the story centers around River, a young girl who has been conditioned by the Alliance to be an expert fighter. She knows a secret, and the Alliance will do anything to stop that secret becoming public knowledge, so they send an assassin (Ejiofor) to get rid of her. But she is currently on Serenity, Reynolds' ship, and he is going to protect her. Fans will be pleased to know that nothing has really changed from the series, and the secret River carries is expertly tied into an unexplored area of the show. All the original cast are back and all do their jobs brilliantly. Captain Reynolds (Fillion) is getting a lot of comparisons to Han Solo, and these claims seem to be utterly justified; he plays the rogue-ish, humorous, yet also serious captain to great effect, which is great as much of the film lays on him. Also good is River (Glau) who can go from seemingly-crazy to rock-hard in the blink of an eye. She gets to do much more than she did in the series, and the exploration of her background is welcoming after the show was cancelled. If there are a few niggles then they are small. The main one is that Serenity shows off its origins  it can come off as a feature length television episode; the first half is a very slow introduction to the plot, and non fans may not like the amount of time it takes to get everything moving. However, this is quickly dispelled by a furious and frantic second half which barely lets up as all the pieces fall into place, and the terrific action scenes kick in, brought together by some very accomplished special effects. There are numerous twists and again, non fans may not always be able to keep up. One thing Whedon is not afraid of is dealing out punishment, even to the good guys. Nothing is certain, and fans may be shocked at a couple of events. I think fans will appreciate more just because what happens throughout the film will mean more to them than they will to beginners (for example, when the Reavers make their appearance fans will know exactly why everyone is so scared of them).However, I doubt that anyone will find Serenity to be lacking in entertainment. It has kept its fresh feel, and as long as the audience can cope with it's style (the western theme is a bit strange to get your head round at first) then there is no reason why it can't be enjoyed by everyone.Rated: 8.5/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",Serenity
243,vdkolkrichard,"A high score on Imbd, it must be good right??",5,21 May 2021,"Well i had high expectations, it all went down the drain.Story is weak, acting is basic, fun is weak, action is weak, only thing positive are the settings/ special effects.A bit like Star Wars on ProzacSome flashbacks of Star Wars, like the fight on the bridge with dark V and his son, but boy, it ain't Star Wars !!Pass this one, I hoped I did.",Serenity
244,doctardis,I now believe - This is great,10,1 October 2005,"Ijust saw the movie, and it was great. My wife never saw TV ""Firefly"" which is the basis of the movie, and she, who does not like science fiction, loved this movie. It is action packed. It is funny. It is exiting. It is true to the series. I never saw ""Firefly"" until two weeks ago. A friend lent me a disk, and I loved it. I am also aware that many TV shows, which develop characters over a TV season, often do not translate well to movies. This really does. You do not have to be some ""Firefly"" loving sci-fi nut to love this movie. I am, but my wife isn't, and she loved this movie. It is a well told story with interesting characters. It is amazing how well the movie gets you into the ""Firefly"" universe. I will not get into the details of the movie, because I think you should see this movie. This movie is not just for science fiction fans. It is for people who like good movies.",Serenity
245,el_nickster,Just plain fun!,10,17 October 2005,"I gave this movie a ""10"" because it is just tons of mindless sci-fi fun. There is a load of adolescent angst-ridden philosophy, but just ignore that and watch the special effects and appreciate the cute jokes in the dialog. This film was made on a relatively low budget, but has what is arguably the best space-combat scene yet filmed (although, even after all of these years, it is hard to beat ""The Wrath of Khan"" in that department). If you watched the series ""Firefly,"" then you will enjoy this film all the more. The TV characters are kind of thrown in haphazardly, so it helps to have some background.To sum up, this is like one of the Star Trek movies. It helps to know the background and the characters, but it is a fun fun fun action movie on its own.Features gun fights, ray fights, missile fight, evil space ships painted with blood and decorated with skulls, dead people, live people, stylishly dressed space rogues, stylishly dressed super-space-spies, stylishly dressed astronauts and spies engaging in semi-witty repartee, stylishly dressed astronauts talking about sexual frustration in space, space hookers who can't act, a guy who fights with a sword in space and knows the ""five fingers exploding heart punch"" from Kill Bill, sword fights in space, ax fights in space, lots of planets that look like the hills of Malibu, lost heat shield excitement, space cannibals, people gored with swords, people gored with harpoons, people shot, cosmic kung fu, big big space battles, no aliens.",Serenity
246,vamp88,fit me with my new browncoat,10,1 October 2005,"I was, lets say an honorary browncoat (browncoats are what fans of the TV show Firefly on which Serenity is based call themselves). I had seen a few episodes on the first (short) run and caught more on the Sci-fi channels recent re-airings, and liked every episode. Also a fan of Joss Whedon, especially Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I love his stories and dialog, the way the characters interact with each other in his stories are always great, and he loves to throw something unexpected at you, no one is ever safe in his scripts. That being said I was looking forward to Serenity. One word sums it up WOW. Definitely one of my favorite films this year. Funny, action packed, dramatic, scary, sad...if you want it in a movie it's here. The spirit of the film is fresh and fun, the dialog is witty and humorous. Just can't say enough about it. The theater I saw it in laughed out loud at every great one liners, gasped at the Reavers (cannabalistic space pirates) attacks, and applauded loudly at the finish of the film. I'm sure the Browncoats were in full force last night, but after seeing the movie new recruits will make it the hottest fashion of this fall season. Can't wait for the stories continuation.",Serenity
247,abcizdaman,An Hidden Gem,10,15 March 2020,"I never heard of the Firefly series, and the first time I watched it was this movie which came a few years after the series ended. The series was highly unknown and only ran 1 season. False advertising and a bad TV spot are the reasons why it was short lived. The show.. is awesome.. even better than this movie in my opinion. A great mix of the old West with outer space and some Asian words mixed in. It's a great series and if you ever have the chance watch the Firefly series before you see this movie. This Serenity movie takes place chronologically after the series. The last few episodes seem to be out of order, and they were from what I read. So far I feel the series chronological order is 1. Serenity (season episode not the movie), 2. The Train Job, 3. Bushwhacked, 4. Shindig, 5. Safe, 6. Our Mrs. Reynolds, 7. Jaynestown, 8. Out of Gas, 9. Ariel, 10. Heart of Gold, 11. Objects in Space, 12. War Stories, 13. Trash, and finally 14. The Message. I just put them in that order today since it made the most sense as to what happened in previous episodes compared to what happened in later episodes. If you watch them in that order things will make sense. Then this movie last. This series/movie is just very original, and there are no words for it but to watch them all and see for yourself. I give the series a 12 out of 10 and this movie a 10+. The Firefly theme song is awesome too, and I always love hearing it. If nothing else give this movie a watch. It's very interesting and original to say the least and glad I found it on Netflix several years ago and found the series later. What a wonderful watch. Maybe someday these creators or someone else will come along to make a similar show. 200 thumbs up!!",Serenity
248,Jeddia,Outstanding - a gift for the fans and a wake up call for everyone else,10,5 October 2005,"I am by no means a Joss Whedon ""fanboy"", but I do not deny the guy has a way of weaving a story that draws you in, and creating characters that you have to love dearly.I never watch television. I only started watching television *shows* when TV on DVD started to become more widely available. One day I was bored and started watching my daughter's Buffy box sets...and was very surprised to find that I wanted more and more. Then came Angel; which I still think was superior to Buffy.Firefly happened on Fox long before I even saw the first episode of Buffy. So when I came upon the Firefly DVD's a few months ago, I was a bit perplexed as to why I hadn't really heard much about it. I watched the 14 episodes and loved every minute of it. But I was distressed at the thought of never knowing what happened to the crew of Serenity. So many unanswered questions. So many great characters. And I was cursing myself for falling in love with yet another sci-fi series to meet an untimely demise at the hands of corporate mismanagement, ignorance, and a general disregard for the fans who are always underestimated. See: Earth2, Space: Above & Beyond, etc.But alas, a movie was coming! What timing. Serenity is a damn good film. My only complaint is that it was too packed with scenario to allow it to dwell for any length of time at any one place. But Mr. Whedon handled this issue with grace whereas many others would've churned out two hours of shallow nonsense. The real problem is that we like Firefly, a series...and Firefly in feature-film format is too fast for us to absorb it all. But that's not to say it wasn't a great ride.From the start, Serenity is solid with action and dialogue from these great characters. The special effects are almost TV'ish at times, but that's perfectly fine given the context. The performances are good; especially Nathan Fillion and Gina Torres. And the story is meaningful; both in the context of the Firefly universe and as a parallel to our own existence.I can't imagine this film being nearly as good to a non-Firefly fan. They claim it plays well as a standalone movie, but some of the most impactful events and imagery in this film relate directly to things in the canceled series. And the same goes for the relationships between the characters on Serenity.Joss Whedon and company (and let's not forget Universal) have given a fine gift to the fans of Firefly. And for those who haven't seen the series and/or are general nay-sayers when it comes to Whedon - wake up. This man is here to stay for real. In a world where more and more audiences want to see some idiot ride a bike into a tree or watch someone eat handfuls of spiders for a few thousand dollars, this kind of storytelling and vision are very welcomed.",Serenity
249,someofusarebrave,so good it is indescribable,10,13 November 2010,"I am so grateful that the TV series 'Firefly' was cancelled so early on, as entirely unjust as that was...because if it hadn't happened, we would probably never have been able to experience this AMAZING movie.The writing! The drama! The shipboard romance! Exquisite.The series was so much MORE than a television series from the get-go anyway...more visually, more dramatically and more complex and at the same time interesting in terms of characterization.The series for me was like a meal too big to digest in one sitting, yet so good you want to try to do so anyway, because you're terrified you will die before having a chance to taste all of it.Wow. Everyone involved with this did something amazing, and unique and innovative and then Fox went and mucked it up. This is why no one watches Fox anymore. I'm glad it seems like all the rest of y'all are going onto big and good things, if not quite bigger and better cuz I'm not sure such a thing exists.You will live on forever in our hearts, Firefly.You more than make up for the heartbreak of Firefly's too-soon demise, Serenity...and have forever changed my concept of what a movie can be.One of my top five favorites of all time, Serenity is...beauty in creation.",Serenity
250,m_a_singer,Surprisingly Good,7,14 May 2006,"I stopped watching television in 2000, so I never saw the series and didn't see this until it came out on DVD. I'm glad I finally did, though I now wish I had added to the box office of the film when it was in theaters. We need to encourage more science fiction like this - unslick (anti-slick, even), believably funny, and telling straight-forward stories. I can see that this would have been very engaging on the small screen, and it holds up pretty well on the big one.The weaknesses are minor, though they add up. If I hadn't read about the film and show first, I wouldn't have understood that the Reavers were more than a one-time threat. The ground-based chase sequence looks physically wrong (as in the physics are wrong, and it is therefore unbelievable). I'm not sure if it was the DVD I saw, but Nathan Fillion's dialog is unintelligible at far too many points - there's a difference between acting and mumbling. Some of the other acting is weak and flat, though not that of Adam Baldwin, Gina Torres, Jewel Staite, or, especially, Chiwetel Ejiofor (though his role is both florid and underwritten and only works because of the craft he brings to it). There is almost no transition from exteriors to interiors, making the whole thing look set-bound.The Serenity itself, though, is one of the best-imagined spaceships I've ever seen, and the opening introduction to the crew very neatly done. The story is nothing ground-breaking, but it's well visualized. I'm afraid that the inevitable serial novels will not capture the space/Western/screwball comedy tone that the film manages, but it's nice that they got to play it on the big screen.Well worth the time for science fiction buffs, especially as we get far too much slick and horror and far too little grit, humor, and humanity in our movies.",Serenity
251,vfrickey,A sequel that's BETTER than the original - it is all Firefly could have been!,10,9 February 2016,"Serenity is the movie sequel to the much-beloved, ended much too soon US Fox television network science-fiction series ""Firefly,"" with all the show's central characters, doing the same fine acting they did in Firefly.And it's not just a sequel - it rises to the occasion to be a much better story than any of the individual episodes of Firefly. Serenity's a luminous rebooting of Firefly, and you don't have to have seen a single episode of Firefly to enjoy it immensely. But those of us who knew and loved Firefly will love it more, because it's also more of what we loved and Fox took away from us.Serenity, like Firefly, is a science fiction story with strong elements of westerns, spy movie intrigue, and lots and lots of spine-tingling action, and wry, irresistible humor throughout - the humor that comes from a cast that has incredible chemistry. The plot begins with a half-western, half very high-tech bank heist which goes very much awry, then evolves into a cosmic spy drama centered on River Tam, the victim of terrible experiments on her brain committed by a secret, murderous agency of the tyrannical Alliance of Planets, which governs the colonies of a distant star settled by refugees from a dying Earth.River Tam and her physician brother Simon are passengers on the starship Serenity, captained by Malcolm Reynolds, a Browncoat - veteran of the war between the Alliance and a confederacy of planets who resisted their overreach (along with his first officer, Zoe Washburn, who's also the wife of the Serenity's pilot). Serenity's crew are the most entertaining bunch of smugglers and mercenaries in fiction, and why so many of us Firefly/Serenity fans wear brown coats. I won't spoil the plot for you - enjoy it for yourself. Then get a brown coat.",Serenity
252,eternalsea,Slicker and better than any of the Star wars prequels,8,13 March 2006,"Serenity is the film the Star Wars prequels never knew. Its fun, its slick and well acted, heck sometimes its even funny. The story is a good and engrossing one that will not be done justice if I try to explain it so I shan't bother. The acting is of a very high standard indeed, despite being a bunch that are generally unknown. The stand outs are Nathan Fillion and Chitwell Ejedorff (horriobly mis spelt probably) as the villain. The effects with any kind of Sci-Fi film are usually fantastic and indeed here there proves to be no exception as the worlds are constructed beautifully, indeed some of the best GGI and special effects in years. The characters are a well developed bunch and the villains the Ravers are a really cool and nasty bunch. All in all Serenity is a kick ass film and one of the finer films of 2005.",Serenity
253,hdavis-29,A High Tech Snooze,2,7 January 2020,"Sorry boys and girls but this is nothing more than an extremely high tech version of a 1940s Republic serial. Back then it was a car chase and a fist fight in every reel. It was just what the adolescent boys wanted. 60 years later, things haven't changed very much. The fights are better staged and instead of 1946 Fords careening down the highway, we have futuristic ships in outer space. Film-making has gotten a lot more sophisticated since then. Obviously, audiences have not.",Serenity
254,SoulfulFX,Second and third times are the charm,9,5 October 2005,"I well remember when the ""Firefly"" series came out in 2002 and remember disliking it. I recall thinking that here was another series where the lot of people are cooped up in a dark and obscured tube (part of my problem with the way another Sci-Fi Series, ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" was produced). I didn't give the show much thought until I started seeing trailers for ""Serenity"". Sci-Fi channel then decided to re-air ""Firefly"" in marathon format, plus a few other episodes and I was surprised to see how much more I liked the series this time around. I suppose this means I changed in the few years that intervened, but either way, I found myself enjoying the caper-type plots that made each episode so much fun. It shared the same witty-line writing that made Whedon's ""Angel"" series a lot of fun to watch as well I discovered. These events prompted me to go ahead and see ""Serenity"" and I was not disappointed. It took the appropriate step above and beyond the caper-plots of the TV series and broadened the stroke for the big screen. It was pleasant seeing the cast reunited so completely and the obscure past of River Tam exploded for all to see. Most of the relationships between the characters were retained and even embellished a little for the wider audience. And true to Whedon's claims, I believe the uninitiated could watch this movie and feel welcome. The movie, as with each episode of the series, includes a brief prologue that explains the overall situation of the 500+ years in the future when the story takes place.I definitely recommend this film to the average sci-fi fan and anyone who likes or even disliked the ""Firefly"" series.",Serenity
255,IkAziz,A guilty pleasure...,7,6 August 2019,"Joss whedons Finest work from rest of his Avengers films...Serenity is a Spin off of original tv series firefly (which cancelled with solo season) same tv actors who played in this movie too and it's not a hardcore SciFi flick just smaller in scaleStill a complete fun entertainer with mixed elements of action,comedy,thriller,everything is perfectly worked in this movie.First half bit confusing not much about the core story,but lots of entertaining stuffs in first half that keeps you hooked up..Second half is were real action take place,last 40s is full of non stop fun filled ride that ends with satisfying climax..Go head if you enjoy mindless Adventure flicks..",Serenity
256,RandomTask-AP,Joss Whedon Strikes Back,8,8 October 2005,"Confronting authority and expectation are territories where Joss Whedon will be very comfortable after this project. After lifting his property from 20th Century Fox TV and landing at Universal Studios, his fictional crew of the titular ship is dodging the powerful Alliance. In an effort to make their less-than-legitimate living and to hide their sibling passengers Simon (Sean Maher) and River (Summer Glau), who possesses abilities and at least one secret which the Alliance wants to get back under control, the crew must evade the powers that be and keep themselves together. This was the premise for the cult TV show, ""Firefly"", which was cancelled in 2002. Unpacking the ""Serenity"" crew out of storage and onto the big screen is no easy task, and, although not a regular viewer of the series (and certainly not a ""Browncoat"" - level fan), my opinion is that Whedon's new adaptation succeeds with aplomb.There are moments when the film does feel televisual rather than cinematic, but they are separated by so much genuine enthusiasm and effective material that they just become part of the mix. The introduction of the villain, The Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor), is somewhat unceremonious, but it is in the midst of a set of startlingly creative transitions which exposit not only the story's universe and glistening dystopia that The Operative represents, but also what started everyone on this interplanetary chase. While a plethora of characters is helpful in scripting a TV show as it provides a greater combination of dramatically conflicting personalities, it proves something of a hindrance in a film. Can everyone be given a significant role throughout the entire production? The answer is an unfortunate no. However, Whedon and his cast work out a balancing act that covers most of the thin points. The flipside to that coin is that the TV cast, who are familiar and dedicated to one another, effectively generate a feeling of familial association and immediacy.These characters, individually and as a group have a real inner lives that you don't find in most sci-fi productions. After sitting through the point-and-shoot ""Aliens Vs. Predator"" , the disaster ""A Sound of Thunder"" as well as the exciting - but boxy - acting in ""Revenge of the Sith"" all in the last year or so, science fiction needs a little inner redemption. Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) is the natural-born deal-maker, but human enough to threaten to shoot his own crew when they refuse his orders in a moment of crisis. Tough and loyal Zoë (Gina Torres) never hesitates in the moment, but after the dust settles, she levels moral questions with her husband and pilot, Wash (Alan Tudyk), who is both comic and conscience. Adam Baldwin's Jayne borders on tough-guy caricature, but he finds ways of making him real by backing down from some fights and articulating his reasoning. There is real tenderness from Simon as doctor and brother, but fierce determination as his sister's keeper. River doesn't have a single role to play, as it seems she is fugitive psychic, lost girl and weapon, and Summer Glau keeps her tied together. Kaylee, Inara and Shepherd Book have their roles reduced to the very pragmatic ones of mechanic, love interest and elder. However, Jewel Staite, Morena Baccarin and Ron Glass all respectively give performances which make it clear that the group would have large holes without them. Not only are these characters fighting for their freedom and a noble cause, but they're also fighting for their own cohesiveness. The events have impact and a price to be paid, so no one arrives at the end the same as when they began.This is a crew with heart and soul, and that is the responsibility of writer-director Whedon. He has a knack for creating quirky and well-rounded characters, and layers his moments as a director. The Operative's weapon of choice is a steel sword, rather than a laser gun. Real steel is simply more threatening and easier for the audience to identify with. It also speaks to the vile nature of the soft-spoken character: This is an assassin who enjoys being up close to his work. When he and the Captain meet in person, the verbal sparing they do (running down each other's possible negotiating stances as clichéd chess moves) is much more exiting than any fisticuffs that follow. There are plenty of effective explosive scenes, but Whedon also quells the special effects for moments of suspense such as a quiet passing through a convoy of enemy ships. There is nothing for the group to do but move silently along and hope they are not caught. A grand chase scene across open plains is done largely with the actors on location, and the thrills are greater for it. Traditional techno babble does exist in points, but it remains smartly minimal. The fact that every other person seems to speak mid-19th Century American West English leaves a stronger impression.These are not polished sci-fi icons making a safe journey into sequel-land. Although this is largely an escapist lark, everyone is trying to get somewhere, and as director, Whedon keeps the journey about the characters, not the spectacle. Any space opera is not without its clichéd trappings, but Whedon, as writer, ultimately makes it about bringing the truth to light, rather than just offing the bad guy. This is a subtext that will resonate more with 21st Century audiences, so much so that if you're looking for a themed double-bill, this might be the (much) lighter half with ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" or ""The Insider"". ""Serenity"" runs as roughly its ship does, but that same grittiness and personality make it feel like a fresh adventure.8 out of 10",Serenity

258,bobwildhorror,Interesting TV Show Extension,8,4 January 2009,"I'm sure people will write more eloquent reviews than me. I'm not now, nor have I ever been, a fan of Firefly. Never watched it a single time. As a result, my prospective is a bit different from the multitude of folks who seem to have devoted their lives to this television program.Despite the claims that SERENITY is a groundbreaking show, what I was faced with was a movie that borrowed heavily. There's a smattering of the original Star Trek (particularly during the finale, when Captain Nathan Fillion gets into a ridiculously prolonged battle with an assassin). There are some borrowings from zombie movies and the later Star Trek (particularly The Borg). There's even a post-apocalyptic strain that could have come from any of a hundred movies...and don't forget the seemingly innocent little girl who is a kung fu fighting machine. Aren't they all? That said, the whole thing is presented with verve and style. The characters are engaging. And the faux western touches were enjoyable, although I got tired of the bad Southern accents. There are worse ways to spend a Saturday night.",Serenity
259,royale_w_cheez44,Sci-Fi GOLD,9,9 October 2005,"Fans of ""Firefly"", or even plain old science fiction will love Serenity. 2005 has been a fantastic year for sci-fi, with Star Wars, War of the Worlds, and now this, gracing the screens. This is truly one of those films that you just can't miss!This film was done superbly by first-time screen director Joss Whedon. From his clever dialog to marvelous acting to kick ass action, everything is spectacular. The characters in this film are wonderfully developed, even for someone who has hardly even seen ""Firefly"". The script is funny and has lots of smart dialog; probably the most well written movie of the year. Don't let the advertisements fool you, though. This film is surprisingly dark and deals with some pretty intense and brutal stuff, especially the Reavers, who are near zombie-like maniacs. The action is brutal; sort of in the way that a Zombie Western in Space would play out. It sounds weird, but trust me, it works flawlessly.If you're a fan of ""Firefly"", see this film NOW. If you're not, see this film anyway, and then check out ""Firefly"" on DVD. Trust me, once you see this fantastic picture, you'll be hooked. This is definitely on of the best pictures of 2005, and it would be a crime to let this one slip by.",Serenity
260,Swampfox,"If nothing else, a great rental",8,4 October 2005,"I am a very late comer to the whole ""Firefly"" universe. How late? Try last week.I had the same reaction I am sure most will when they hear that it is ""a western in space."" I also watched 5 mins. of it when it was actually broadcast 3 years ago and thought it indeed looked as dumb as it sounded. I then forgot all about Joss Whedon's stab at taking his ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" style into space.Now, with the movie coming out and only 14 episodes to plow through, I decided the interesting trailer warranted a second look at at least the first couple of shows. It was one of the better entertainment choices I made this summer to say the least. The show is, as the characters might say, a hoot! The movie, SERENTITY, is very good. Can't call it excellent (unless you want to compare it to REVENGE OF THE SITH, then it's a damn masterpiece), but it's better than every other popcorn flick I saw this summer. Whedon has smartly done what Nicholas Myer did with Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan: put less emphasis on some of the characters and more on the plot and action. With nine main characters and two hours of time, it's a wise decision to make this more about the one character with biggest secret past. He also manages to keep several steps ahead of audience expectations, so much so that when it gets down to the final act I really had no idea how it was going to end. The usual happy ending ain't something you should be expecting in these parts folks.I think what I like most is that even though the film and TV show are meant to be escapist entertainment, it's meant to be adult escapist entertainment. Unlike other space set things, this is not a big happy family and sex as a topic crops up frequently. You have to love a show where the most respectable character is the 25th Century's version of a courtesan, called ""A Companion."" That's right, the one with all the class is culturally-trained, high priced call girl who belongs to union/guild for such.Even without the show, the film is certainly more fun than FANTASTIC FOUR or WAR OF THE WORLDS.",Serenity

How can this movie deserve an eight?? I did not see the Firefly series, so I did not know anything about the characters ... but I think this is not the reason I did not like it. Cardboard characters, non existent plot, poor effects, confusing editing and plot holes are the real reasons for my dislike. Being rated at 8 on IMDb I expected at least a good B movie, but I was wrong. On the contrary Starship troopers - that was an enjoyable sci-fi movie - is rated ""only"" at 7.2 !!

It didn't help that they brought in the Property Brothers of space - they didn't add anything to the movie and were annoying.

I'm a newbie and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I haven't seen Firefly at all but after this I'm surely lining up for the Firefly dose. Well made, nicely executed script, good CGI and nicely acted by most of them. Couldn't ask for anything more. Captain Malcolm Reynolds was played nicely by Nathan Fillion and his character was peppered by some good humor. His crew, Zoe, Hoban and Jayne {seen him in Chuck before} all played their parts well. Dr. Simon played by Sean Maher was patchy in his performance but wasn't bad by any means. Summer Glau as River Tam is the center of the story and does a decent job, funny though her performance reminded me of her character in Terminator series. Jewel Staite was absolutely fabulous. She was so good in portraying Kaylee that she left me gasping for more. Talent here! Morena Baccarin as Inara Serra is one of the most beautiful ladies I've ever seen on screen. She was unbelievably beautiful in this film and that had a lot to do with her wardrobe{the first scene itself made me drool..:) }, she was aesthetically pleasing. I checked her profile and shouldn't take anything away from her, she is naturally beautiful. Beauty at its best! Aah, I've only described the cast, the film is pleasing on so many levels that it would take a while to finish the review. So lets stop by saying the film is a delight and I recommend it to all of you, especially the Star Wars, Star Trek, etc fans. Enjoy, a well made film!-----------9.1/10",Serenity
264,fog-9,enjoyable romp,6,6 March 2006,"having heard good things via word of mouth regarding ""firefly"", the TV series which spawned this movie, i had high expectations... after reading the reviews on this site, my curiosity increased... the previews looked good and the hype seemed to suggest this was going to be something special, something groundbreaking...of course, it's not... serenity is damn entertaining though, transcending its modest, ""slightly better than TV movie"" look to deliver some nice action, good momentum, and a little Saturday morning swagger...acting ranges from slightly embarrassing (summer glau) to genuinely endearing (nathan fillion)... there are definitely moments when you know this was designed by one of the pillars of teen TV, joss whedon, as it gets mighty teenie at times... the obvious downer is the way every culture had such American trappings... it's like they didn't have time to flesh out inara's character and make her stand out from the others (and the deleted scenes did nothing to help)... she's supposedly the product of a completely different lifestyle, but you wouldn't know it!...but still, it's got an irresistible charm, some cool one liners (which made the movie for me) and quite a considerable shock near the end... let's just say it's not often something happens in a movie like this that takes you completely by surprise... i also liked the whole western meets sci-fi thing, although some may find it hard to resolve primitive projectile weapons with ships that can traverse the depths of space...watching this reminded me of the superb anime ""cowboy bebop"", which somehow managed to appeal to me even more... but serenity is definitely a good rental for those missing han solo (and that includes me) in the new star wars movies... enjoy!",Serenity
265,jetskiboybze,Shame this great film was nessecary in the first place.,10,12 June 2019,"Didnt see Firefly till after seeing this film and hunted it down because of it so this review is about the film not the awesome series I discovered as a result. Firstly I loved the plot, not overly complicated yet nicely predictable to a pleasant happyish ending. Like others I was unhappy with certain characters demises (even more so after I watched the series) but thought unlike others that they were worthwhile in the context of the film. Where the film really scored for me was in the cast (including Serenity herself). How do you get 4 seriously hot women to play together? Morena Baccarin in this role was one of the most perfect women Ive ever seen (better than in Deadpool) and Jewel Staite wasnt far behind. As to the male contingent I thought Nathan Fillion was born for this role and he was ably supported by the others especially a hilarious Adam Baldwin as Jane. Chiwetel Ojiofor was superb as the villainous rascal fitting in nicely as the obvious new operative to the ex operative from Mals crew. Cameos were all done well. All in all a superb film that afterwards rewatching I thought did a great job of tying up the series loose ends
To raters below 5 I say please get a life and try to enjoy some really nice escapism done really well. Perhaps you were paid by Fox to try and justify their abysmal Firefly cancellation decision or maybe you are just really sad no life people who enjoy trashing stuff.",Serenity
266,spazmodeus,So good that I don't want a sequel!,10,16 October 2005,"Seriously, this was a brilliantly-designed world with perfectly-conceived characters, who live through a gigantic story. I know Whedon was thinking he'd do a sequel, though disappointing box office returns are making that seem less likely now. Shamefully, we'll have to wait for the DVD release before this makes back the studio's money - unless foreign audiences are less stupid than we Americans. Anyway, I really think that this story must live on as a weekly show, not as a series of movies. Put this genius stuff back on TV, get it syndicated, that's how it will take off. As an owner of the Firefly DVD set I can tell you that nobody sees this without loving it. It's the same with the movie. It's not just sci-fi fans who get this stuff. It's everyone. Sadly, the vast majority of that everyone don't seem to realize that this is a great movie for them, but that will be solved with just mere exposure. This movie is good enough so that it might have done it on its own. Bad marketing prevented that, I guess. Now we need the show back.",Serenity
267,psychogoatee,Can't take the sky from me...,9,1 October 2005,"Serenity indeed. Here's a film that delivers exactly what the fans need. Quality sci-fi action drama greatness. The style is very true to the series, Firefly, as is just about every other aspect. The cast is dynamite together, the action is sizzling, and the effects are eye-popping considering the budget. Not since Wrath of Khan has such an epic story unfolded in such epic space opera fashion. Its made for the Firefly fans, taking these great characters and fleshing them out, putting them through their most dangerous adventure yet. Even if you don't know and love the Firefly series, the movie stands on its own as a solid sci-fi adventure. Everyone looking for gripping sci-fi action needs to check it out.",Serenity
268,blubb06,A soup biscuit,6,11 October 2007,"Y'know, the little cookies with no particular flavor that taste great in a strong soup? It's a mix of Han Solo's adventures with scarier zombies than Resident Evil and Xena the Warrior Queen's sisters, fighting it out in a Mad Max universe darker than George Miller could have imagined - déjà-vu everywhere. The story isn't brainy, the action or special effects aren't that spectacular (but good), yet the cocktail somehow sticks. It must be all that stuff rolled into one, deep moral questions coupled with shock effects, the pathetic traumatized girl next to man-munching reevers (the mistake of the Resident Evil movies: they are too cold and simplistic, you don't really give a s**t if the heroes make it into the next episode).For a ""fun in space""-movie it's quite good. The best part is definitely the beginning - ""We are not telling other people WHAT to think, we teach them HOW to think"" - that is a truly memorable statement for any ""advanced"" society, one that completely negates thinking at all. But the big nemesis is childish in the end, once he has found his Waterloo he will no longer work for this abominable outfit, thank you. Yes, and the truth will set you free and the good always survive until the last sequel. If the story had more of a Bourne Identity to it, it would be better than simply entertainment.So it's not a challenging feature film but for the same reasons simply fun to watch, and you don't have the know the series to enjoy it.",Serenity
269,jdavisjdavis,Excellent movie,10,2 October 2005,"I think this movie would blow anyone off their socks. I personally picked up the TV series recently and fell in love with it, so I could be a little biases. However, this movie just oozes quality. The characters, the action, the story, the writing, the art of it all... loved it.The only thing I'll say is that ***slight spoiler*** I don't like it when bad things happen to characters that I love. I'll not give away any specifics.Anyway, perhaps the writing and character development outshines anything else in it's class. Serenity brings together qualities, in for example, the captain that seem so real, that it really draws you in and makes you feel everything going on throughout the movie like it was completely real. The sci fi in the movie was superb... I felt a nod to Star Wars and others, but it's completely it's own. The old west theme totally works... this thing is one of a kind. Yeah, it's just shiny. I would kill to have the show back, but if that never happens, I'll gladly watch the movie and it's sequels time and again.",Serenity
270,ven2s,Excellent!!!!,10,30 September 2005,"I thought after seeing the very weak but promising trailer, that Serenity would be about a 2, maybe 21/2 star Sci-Fi flick! But was I presently surprised. I am a big fan of this ill-fated, quirky series that FOX put on it's Friday Night deahtwatch; unless it's on Sci-Fi Friday most Fox Friday series will only get a small following even if it is really uniquely good; aka, ""Space Above And Beyond,"" among the few.But due to an expanding fan base, due in part to the high DVD sales, FireFly, aka, Serenity, has gotten a new life. The movie is fast paced with great acting, a very good story, and great effects! Still maintaining that quirky space western feel, FireFly translates well to the big screen in Joss Whedon's deft hands. You can tell he did this one for the fans and for the new fans yet to come! It's a must see!",Serenity
271,baconballs1969,Rubbish,1,3 May 2006,"This movie was a massive let down for me. I am a sci-fi fan but I felt this movie was just TOO sci-fi, even for me.I didn't even understand it and maybe I am not being very fair by giving it such a poor rating as I was not in the mood for watching a movie when I watched it and was constantly clock watching hoping it would quickly end.At a later date I will probably watch it again when I am more in the mood but I spent most of the time sitting there wondering why I had wasted the rental money on such dross.I hate Buffy and Angel so it makes me wonder why I even hired this movie in the first place.Rubbish.",Serenity
272,FMACDONALD,Joss Whedon knows how to make entertainment fun,9,1 October 2005,"Serenity is a blast. It really is. A lot of big time newspapers and Magazines such as The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, USA Today, Entertainment Weekly, The Chicago Tribune, etc., etc. has called this the next big Hollywood Sci-Fi series. I can only hope that is true. Serenity is the little TV show that could, created by Joss Whedon. Whedon created the mega popular, critically acclaimed, cult phenomenon Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and it's spin off Angel. Whedon has a love for horror and Sci-Fi and Westerns as well. so after Buffy and Angel did well he created his Sci-Fi/Western Hybrid Firefly. seeing Buffy and Angel were both successful the FOX network tripped over themselves to land Firely. They got it, and in typical FOX fashion put the screws to Whedon by airing the episodes out of order and confusing the hell out of fans. Plus FOX aired the series on Friday nights at 9:00 pm. So the age bracket Whedon and the network was targeting were out and never home to see it. Sadly after about 5 episodes FOX canned Firefly. However even though the show left Whedon fans confused it also left them curious. Especially with the witty dialog and a cast that gelled so perfectly together. Enter the miracle that is TV shows on DVD. Whedon released his series on DVD in a four disc, one volume set and it sold like wild fire, just like The Family Guy. People who saw Firefly loved it and begged Whedon to pull a Family Guy and see if he could get his show back on TV. Whedon instead took it to the next level and put it out as a big budget movie which is now Serenity. Serenity (which is the name of the ship, it's a Firefly class ship, hence the name of the show and movie) is a dumbed down Star Trek. That's not a shot at either series by the way. This is a good thing. I like Star Trek but it can be to intelligent for it's own good confusing the hell out of fans. Serenity has fun and even at times of taking itself to seriously, pokes fun at itself. This is what makes Joss Whedon such a good writer. He's not afraid to have fun with his creations. The plot is simple. Malcom ""Mal"" Reynolds is the captain of Serenity. His crew consists of Zoe (The beautiful Gina Torres)the first mate, Wash (Alan Tudyk) the pilot and Zoe's husband, Jayne (Adam Baldwin) the resident tough guy who's funny as hell, Kaylee (Jewel Staite also beautiful) the ship's mechanic, Simon (Seam Maher) the ships doctor, and Simon's sister River (Summer Glau) who's not all there. Serenity's crew are thieves who do job's like stealing, and smuggling (kind of like a certain smuggler/pirate from another popular sci-fi series) to make ends meet. Simon and River on the other hand are fugitives that are on the run from The Alliance, a Gestapo intergalactic police/military/united nations peace keeping organization who will do what ever it takes to keep peace through out the galaxy. The alliance will do anything to get River back because River is actually a ""living Weapon"" created by The Alliance. So Serenity travels from one end of the galaxy to another trying to do jobs to put food on the table and keep the ship running while trying to avoid The Alliance and the mutant looking cannibal freaks The Reavers, who will kill anything that they come in contact with. Serenity is just a plain old great time at the movies. This cast (just like on the TV) gels perfectly together and the dialog is witty as it is intelligent. It's hard to say who shines the most of the cast because they are all so perfect together, but if I have to pick one person it's Nathon Fillion, who plays Malcom Reynolds. This guy has a promising career in Hollywood especially in the sci-fi genre. If George Lucas ever decided to make any movies out of The Young Han Solo novels this guy would be a great Solo. You can't help but root for him or his crew when they are being chased be The Alliance or The Reavers. Now if any of you out there never saw Firefly and think Serenity looks good but don't want to see it because you never saw Firefly don't worry. Whedon's script is written perfectly for anyone who's never seen the show. Trust me when I say you don't need to see the TV series to understand Serenity. As a matter of fact I saw this film with my Wife and a friend of ours. My wife and I loved the series and our friend never saw it. He not only understood it perfectly but loved it as much as we did. For a good, leave your brain at the door, eye candy, fun film see Serenity. It's a great time at the movies. Well worth seeing on the big screen. I really hope this becomes the next great Sci-Fi series that The Matrix was supposed to be. With Joss Whedon's writing I have a feeling it will be. On a scale of 10 I give Serenity a 9. Like I said a great time at the movies.",Serenity

274,Crannicus_Maximus,Serenity: My Introduction to a Marvellous 'Verse,9,20 May 2007,"I was, upon first viewing of this film, completely oblivious to the existence of any of the characters, concepts, and etcetera featured within it: I was, as some of us Firefly fans refer to it, a ""Firefly virgin"".Of course, things have changed since that momentous evening. I have since become enthralled by Joss Whedon's brilliant creation, have thoroughly enjoyed each of the many Firefly episodes-- and the film-- half a dozen (or more) times, and have fallen in love with several of the regular (and a few irregular) characters. Whoa.My only criticism for the film-- and the only reason why it did not get the perfect ten-- is the downscaling of Ron Glass' role (for those who aren't as obsessed as I, Ron Glass portrays Book). Book was, and remains, one of my favourite characters in all sci-fi universes.9/10",Serenity
275,DrLex,Excellent,10,24 April 2007,"Somehow this movie escaped my attention when it was released. I might have heard the name here and there but I didn't even know what kind of movie it was until about 10 seconds before watching it, when someone said ""hey, I have this sci-fi movie here, wanna watch?"" Moreover, I only know 'Firefly' from descriptions and have never seen any episode of it. So in short, as far as watching this movie with a clean slate is concerned, I'm probably the closest one can get.'Serenity' is packed with all the elements that can make a good movie. I said ""can"", because just mixing good ingredients doesn't guarantee a good result. However, in this case the mix _is_ good. There's action, humor, emotions, character development, suspense and even a message that doesn't come over as patronizing, and everything comes in exactly the right doses at the right time. The characters aren't all cardboard good and bad guys, which makes it all the more interesting. The ""Han Solo"" comparison someone else made, describes it pretty well.It isn't just good on the inside, but also on the outside. This movie succeeds in many of the harder cinematographic tricks where others have failed. Camera movements are often very original and complex without being confusing. There are a lot of sudden jumps between flash-backs and the main story, sometimes even flash-forwards or hypothetical situations. Even though they may seem confusing instantly, after a few seconds they always make sense. The most 'unremarkable' about the movie may be the CGI. Being a sci-fi movie, CGI is quite abundant, and the graphics sometimes have a bit of an overly 'glossy' look. This reminded me ""I'm watching computer graphics"" at some points, but that's easily forgiven considering the quality of the rest.This movie proves that it's possible to create good sci-fi that's not just a clone of one of the (insert small number here) standard stories. It has hints of many other movies like Pitch Black, Equilibrium and even Star Wars, but overall it was unlike anything I've seen. Even when it seemed to head towards some inevitable clichés, it ended up playing tricks and avoiding the cliché in a surprising or funny way. In the end, it may well cause me to take a deeper look at 'Firefly'.",Serenity
276,james_norman1981,Let's hope for a shiny future,10,10 March 2006,"There are problems with this movie... Occasionally it looks low budget, sometimes props are clearly props, there aren't any recognisable (read bankable) stars, the story needed a fair bit of suspension of disbelief, every now and then the sense of scale is off and there are problems tying the film in with the series. But I've still given it ten stars... Why? Because Serenity is one of the best examples of modern film making! Now that is quite an inflammatory statement but I will try and provide some reasons for it.Put simply, Serenity represents the antithesis of a typical Hollywood film: low budget (relatively), no stars and made by someone who might well have 'TV program creator' stamped on his tombstone. These are all things that are anathema to your average studio executive. So why did Serenity get made? There are two sides to that: the creators (Whedon, Minear, the actors and so forth) and the fans. Both sides desperately wanted Firefly to continue and their combined pressure, along with other fans (Enterprise's so I've read) managed to create enough buzz to have this anti-film commissioned. That is a staggering achievement.What is equally impressive is how gripping and mind blowing a yarn Serenity is. Following on, very loosely, from the series (which I saw afterwards and must admit I prefer, albeit only by a small margin) Serenity is a film that takes you on a fast moving, funny, touching and unpredictable ride grossly in excess of most of what Hollywood has created in recent years. Whereas the studios have gone for the safest bets they can (as per usual), often ramming poorly made films down our throats with marketing allowances way in excess of Serenity's entire budget (Revenge of the Sith or War of the Worlds spring to mind), Serenity represents a radical departure, telling a story that deserved to be told without taking any of the easy ways out that might have made it more profitable - recasting the leads for example.Instead every actor present is a relative unknown and they all seize their opportunity with an enthusiasm and love for their roles sorely lacking from bigger budget pictures. You can genuinely feel their affection for each other and the Firefly 'verse, as well as the older films that inspired it - Nathan Fillion's Han Solo, sorry Malcolm Reynolds, reminds us of everything the Star Wars prequels missed. On top of that the various new comers do very well indeed, Chiwetel Ejiofor epitomising clinical coolness as the monstrous Operative while David Krumholzt seems right at home as the computer super geek of the future, Mr. Universe. Everyone involved gives their all and it is reflected in the final product.Joss Whedon also deserves a huge amount of credit for his daring decisions, most notably the hardship he puts his leads through. Few punches are pulled and, although some of the risks work better than others, at no point do you feel that this film is boringly predictable. Added to this is a relatively straight forward narrative structure and progression which gives ample room for the acting, script and special effects to be shown off without jeopardising the story. Some of these effects do look less than real, that is true, but the whole film is put together so lovingly and so effectively that you tend to give it a lot more leeway than you would a marketing behemoth. Of particular note is the clever use of CG. Instead of the routine, CG everything we've come to expect from Sci-fi films, Serenity uses its computer generative effects as sparingly as possible and usually to make something visually stunning. You know that you're looking at something fake, but the fact that they're not expecting you to say 'Oh that's real' means that you can accept the splendour and paper over the occasional crack, if you're prepared to.Critics of this film site many of the things I've mentioned in the first paragraph as reasons for their dislike but I disagree. To me, it is the rough edges that make this film what it is. It isn't polished to a high sheen, paced at breakneck speed or filled with blinding images to confuse the audience and cover up the deficiencies in the plot. Instead it's just a story of (relatively) ordinary people in the future, living lives not unlike how ours would be, should we be in the same situation, and treasuring the things we love: companionship, truth, loyalty and other, unquantifiable qualities. Everyone involved is committed to the process and, if you let it, you are as well. That is because, unlike so many of today's films, Serenity is made with one thing the majority of the others lack: heart, and because of that it deserves to be ranked far ahead of all the insultingly simple, star heavy and plot lite pieces of cinema which are inflicted on us by a movie industry jaded by its pure desire to make money. If they took a moment to see what you can create should you go for quality over quantity we would all benefit.",Serenity
277,MotoMike,Serenity - old wine in new spaceships,7,10 January 2006,"{Spoilers} ""Serenity"" (and Firefly, the series that spawned it) is an infuriating piece of work. For every facet of it that ""sings"" (and lots of it does - some of the dialog, Mal's personality and leadership, Shepherd Book underplaying his part, Inara's hotness, Zoe's excellence) there's lots of it that falls flat on its face (Mal's dialog, everybody's dialog, the anachronisms, and not just the six-shooters, Jayne's repellence as a character, Mal's relationship with Inara). So, to start out with, here's a list of top ten reasons the movie won't spawn many sequels: 10. Mal's relationship with Inara. This is on a junior-high emotional level. 9. Everybody occasionally lapsing into incomprehensible Chinese. 8. Adam Baldwin's character didn't get the memo saying that main characters shouldn't be repellent, irredeemable jerks. 7. Dialog that occasionally makes Jar Jar Binks sound like Hemingway. 6. Kaylee's crush on Simon. 5. Simon's not noticing Kaylee's crush on him because of his crush on his sister. Ewww. 4. The whole steel-rod-through-the-forehead thing about River. No thanks. 3.Shepherd Book's non-sermon about believing. Makes Unitarians look like devout Muslims. 2. The wrong character dying near the end. 1. ReaversSounds like I hated it, which I didn't, because the bottom line (which movies like the Star Trek series, the last three Star Wars installments, and the last two ""Alien"" movies, for just a start) for a space opera is that you better be having fun, and at any given point in time, somebody in this movie is having fun, and I kept thinking that in spite of its inexpertitude (is that a word? - maybe in Chinese?), it was, for me, a hell of a lot more enjoyable than Return of the Revenge of the Clone Warlike Jedi. Roger Ebert's review pointed out that this space opera isn't far from horse opera (Westerns). This particular one is closer than most. What appears to have happened is that Joss Whedon decided to write a story about some former soldiers turned semi-outlaws set in post-American Civil War era (circa, say, 1875 or so). This bunch of shoot-em ups are a combination of gypsies, thieves, and rogues who wander around the Wild West chasing gold shipments, payrolls, and wagon trains, and fightin' off Injuns and Federals in equal numbers. Then he plucked the whole shootin' match, sixguns, nineteenth century dialog and mores, cowboys, Indians and all and plunked 'em down in space - same ideas: disillusioned former rebel soldiers wandering around the frontier stealing payroll shipments, talking' to the wimmenfolk in that kind of aw-shucks macho clueless way that the menfolk do on the wide prairie, and wearin' homespun and brown denim 'cause it wears like iron. Take a listen to any five minutes of the dialog and you start to hear Huck Finn after lightin' out for the frontier.Not that there's anything wrong with that; once you get the rhythm of the speech and the fact that almost nobody seems to mind that they're using revolvers in an era of warp (faster-than-light) speed, and you can finally get to the plot, which actually worked for me - the (Johnny Mnemonic - derived) idea of the secrets being locked up in somebody's skull (and that somebody being actually psychic, kinda sorta) and the big guys wanting her back real bad now, and meanwhile, they're just wandering around dealing with various lowlifes in bars and on non-developed (""Terraformed"") planets. For those of us for whom the bar scene in the first Star Wars represented kind of a high point of the movie, this movie does just fine, and serves as a reminder that there's a whole lot of self-important, ponderous science fiction movies that don't work - and need to saddle up and get back to Tatooine to see what all the excitement is about.",Serenity
278,elfflame,A new breed of sci-fi movie,9,22 June 2007,"I loved this movie. It had everything that made the show great. I should say that I wasn't as into the show as some, but I did watch from the very beginning. I've always liked Zoe and Inara, and Mal as well. Knowing a movie was coming, I re-watched all the episodes, and between that and the excitement on my f-list, I have to say my love for the show has grown by leaps and bounds. And the movie was everything I needed to see.After leaving the movie and thinking it out, I could see that this is the place Joss would have eventually steered the show, though over a much longer time-period, with little side-trips now and again, more dwelling on some of the bits we saw, like the twins, and Mr. Universe (wouldn't that have been a great episode to watch?). And our nameless assassin would have taken a much longer route to torturing our favorite crew. The revelation of the origin of the Reavers would have been the culmination of a season, with the final episode that season the big fight at the end of the movie. I see it all quite clearly. But then I watched Buffy and Angel from the beginning, so I know how Joss tends to write. And he never disappoints. Even if he tears your heart out, he always leaves you with a smile.I hope this picture makes so much money that they have to do another. Cause I wanna see it. This is the Star Trek of right now. I want to see River out-pilot everything in the galaxy. I want to see them take on new crew and missions. I want to find out what Shepherd Book was doing before he was a Shepherd! Oh, and I WILL see Mal and Inara kiss if it's the last thing they ever do...Go see this film. Go take your family to see it, go take your friends to see it, or take your pets,, even. Just go.Bits and Pieces -- Wash.... I'm still in shock, and I shouldn't be. I mean, this IS Joss Whedon we're talking about. I had no idea it was coming at all. Wash isn't one of my absolute favorite characters, but you could always count on him to lighten the mood in a sweet way. His ""Floating like a leaf"" line got me through the fight sequence. I'm still crying for Zoe. The fighter should never loose the love of their life, because they're always prepared for it to be the other way round. Oh, and who else has been watching the episodes recently enough to have seen the one where Zoe and Wash were discussing children? That should have been my clue right there, really. Joss never lets anyone live happily ever after. And Zoe's reaction during the fight with the Reavers--I was SO sure she was going to die. She definitely wanted to. Thank god she didn't. But she won't ever be the same.Reavers. Ew. As Willow Rosenberg said, ""There's a big, scary, unfun."" Now, granted, there were only two big choices for what this movie could be about, but still, I didn't particularly want to see the Reavers. And finding out that they're all the Alliance's fault? Not so much a surprise, but still, horrific and sad.I wasn't too pleased with Inara's role in this movie. She's my favorite character, and has shown, time and time again, that she has a backbone. Yet she was consistently in the background just standing there, staring while the others discussed their fates. There were two whole scenes in this movie where her part actually worked. The incense in her rooms, and her and Mal at the end, where she nearly admits she wants to come back to Serenity. Still, at least she was there.Shepherd Book got almost no screen time. Two scenes, and that was it. His death seemed a waste to me. I mean, why have him die in the middle of telling Mal whatever it was he really needed to know? And who the heck is he, already? Hubby says he's Alliance, possibly even ex-Parliment... I just really want to know. Joss has made too many references to him for it not to mean something.Was rather shocked at the opening scenes showing Simon rescuing River from the Academy. Not at all what I'd expected. I'd expected a group, not Simon the gormless acting every bit the Council member... Kinda creepy, really. Right until he went into action.Kaylee. Kaylee and Simon! Finally! Standing up to Mal when he denigrated Simon for not going after what he wanted after that long. Ooooh, yeah. Never upset Kaylee. She may seem sweet, but she'll gut you if you hurt her. And when Simon confessed that he regretted not doing anything with her before... ""The heck with this. I wanna live!"" I just love Kaylee, she makes me grin. She's the heart of the ship.",Serenity
279,E-Z-Rider,"Weak, cheesy, trite-- with some pretty good special effects",6,3 October 2005,"I wasn't planning to write a review, but after reading all the gushing comments by others, I feel an obligation to do so. I've never heard of Firefly and walked in having no idea what to expect--except that the movie had gotten so much hype. I was severely disappointed. It's not the worst movie ever made--or even the worst sci fi movie, but the movie is weak in just about every way that counts. There is nothing new about the plot or the action--small band of rebels fighting evil empire. Where have we heard that one before? The largely unknown (to me) actors were just not very good or very subtle; the roles they played were cardboard cutouts; the action meandered over an interminable 119 minutes, though it seemed much longer. (And yes, I had was able to get a soda refill AND a bathroom break--without losing much continuity.) The special effects were pretty good, especially in the beginning, but if I see another movie where fleets of spaceships slam into each other while battling in close quarters, I'll surely scream. And then there were the really cheesy and wholly inexplicable items, such as, why does one of the characters traipse around in a spaceship wearing a new evening dress in almost every scene (and how did she manage to get all those dresses on board anyway)? And, why does the captain speak lines that sound like they come from a combination of GI Joe and Max Headroom?But the worst part is the really poor payoff, after having to endure what is essentially a soap opera for almost two hours. The big secret they're chasing down--the big, BIG truth that will bring down the government, turns out to be sort of silly. Would anybody really care 15 years later? I sort of doubt it.Anyway, I can't say I hated the movie--at least I didn't fall asleep. But don't be fooled by the hype. This is an utterly forgettable movie, and you can easily wait to catch it on a long flight or on DVD. Or miss it altogether.",Serenity
280,JolinKnight,It can be a brilliant series,9,19 July 2013,"I give her a high mark as I am really a fan of Firefly. The adventure of Serenity and her cute crews, both deeply live in my heart. When I know this movie, the one specially for Firefly, it's overwhelming. The familiar character, the unchanged decoration of inside the ship and the same feeling of their conversation, all can make me burst into tears.I don't want to judge anything about the movie, following its plot is my only wish. The second biggest suspense in Firefly comes out on the table - the reavers, we got answers to what are them and where do they come from. The scenes in this film can be called spectacular, a exciting space fight and several scenes of physical fights. As a movie, only time is limited, so that for our fans it's a pity that we expect more but only can get those little. Anyway the ending is kind of harmony and happy ending.Actually, I really hope it can be a series movies as the villains ""two by two, hands in blue"" are never given a chance to perform. However, it is 2013, 8 years later when Serenity released, there seems no possibility that she will have brothers or sisters. It doesn't matter how long it is for waiting, I still think the following plot can be unfolded, more secrets can be exposed. It took 10 years for James Bond came back to screen and it took almost 20 years for Star Wars to come back. I wish Serenity series can release like Star Trek, please our inspirational director Joss, I know you can do it. For the fans you never downed, please honor us again. No matter how long it is, waiting for your next legend of Serenity has no end.",Serenity
281,Kellyann-1,Phenomenal film and incredible acting,10,28 October 2005,"Serenity is a phenomenal film. The acting is incredible. Nathan Fillion (as Mal)and Summer Glau(as River)really shine but the whole cast is excellent. Adam Baldwin brings the muscle and funny as Jayne, and Gina Torres and Alan Tudyk as Zoe and Wash are awesome. There are nine wonderful characters in this movie that you want to get to know and see more of. I don't want to give any spoilers away, just want to say that the writing, directing,acting,music and fight scenes in Serenity were extraordinary. You don't have to be a fan of the TV show to enjoy this movie, my friends are proof of that.I highly recommend Serenity to any movie-viewer.",Serenity
282,ArmsAndMan,In the words of Dr. Johnson...,5,10 October 2005,"I'm reminded of a story about Samuel Johnson (1709-1784 ) who was given a manuscript to evaluate, and he read the work of a younger writer as a favor.He summed up his response in a short letter to the neophyte: ""Your work is both original and good. However, that which is good is not original, and that which is original is not good."" Sums up my feelings about this movie.I did find the actress who plays Zoe to be exceptional. She could emerge as a real star. Her intensity and beauty are a rare combination. She made the movie come alive every time she appeared on screen.",Serenity
283,kjruk,Worth watching but not great,6,9 March 2013,OK it's worth watching when there is nothing better to do. It's not going to be classic SciFi. It's a kind of poor man's Star Wars - a shadowy centralised power that tries to control people's behaviour. Just like home.One of the irritating things about this movie is the Geek-speak or was it Teen-speak? They don't speak plain English or American. Sometimes it's a kind of metaphor speak and then it's just babble speak and trying to be clever but what for? It doesn't serve any purpose and nobody says anything worth listening to anyway. And then the mumble away as in a lot of US films. I can understand ordinary Americans perfectly - North or South when I listen to ordinary people on the news or documentaries and so on. It's the new Hollywood way - mutter-speak. So that's irritating.Then we never actually see who the central power is. Only their mad bad agent. And we never really see the flesh eating mutants either. There is nothing like a close-up of an Orc or an Alien to make the monster believable and satisfying. I want to see the monsters! The plot is so so - seen it all before. Even the girl's psychic character isn't really developed.And the ending! You've got to be kidding! All it takes for the evil one to shed tears and reform is to know the truth and then it's all luvvy dovey. Yuk.,Serenity
284,Tim851,Disappointing,4,7 June 2009,"I've only recently gotten around to watching ""Firefly"" on Blu-Ray. It's not the eight wonder of the world, that the fan-people make it out to be, but it's a very entertaining TV show, I found it quite similar to Farscape, a show I also like very much.And just like Farscape, the follow up movie just sucks bad. For different reasons though. In Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars, they tried to force 22 episodes of a never produced 5th season into what amounts to 4 episodes and that had to fail.In Serenity, it's pretty much the opposite. There wasn't apparently anything in particular, they wanted to do or tell. They finally reveal the 3 minutes worth of back-story to that erratically told and attached feeling X-Files-sideplot featuring River and the Men in Black and it's every bit as disappointingly mediocre as one would expect.After that, they just filled it with wholly uninspired generic Sci-Fi-Action, that had absolutely nothing to do with the TV-show. The movie loses almost all of the trademark humor of Whedon-productions, totally neglects all of the established characters (Captain: humorous, Kaylee: light-hearted, Jayne: mean), invents a new villain, a Deus ex machina and one laughably Star Trek/Gate like story of origin. And of course kills a few regulars, 'cause that adds depth.The show I'd give 8/10, but this movie is glad to get away with 4/10.",Serenity
285,SUGAR2TWO,Good as a long episode of Firefly but not enough as a standalone movie,6,15 June 2021,"Despite all the best efforts to give an insight for a new viewer about all the characters, it's just too much to pick up in a swift manner in order to enjoy the movie without getting lost. Not a problem for a Firefly fans but there lots of other flaws. A lot of characters, events but not enough of each, a lot of way too convenient things. Movie feels rushed like it's want to show you lots of things but at the same time tries to contain itself within 2hr mark. It is also pretty damn dark and brutal. It could've been and should've been stretched for a whole second season or at least a couple of episodes of it. Shame. Still better than nothing.",Serenity
286,FilmSchoolWriter,Welcome aboard,9,1 June 2006,"I was super surprised at just how much I enjoyed Serenity. And I'm even more surprised that I enjoyed it the next time I watched it, and the next time, etc. It's really, very good! Loved it from start to finish, and it actually gets better (and faster paced) each time I watch it. I've been around the classic sci-fi movies since forever. Star Trek and Star Wars buff, right here. And now I'm a big Serenity/Firefly Buff too. I really wish that I'd known about ""Firefly"" when it was on Fox because you bet that I'd have watched it.Okay, down to this movie. Is it flawed? Of course -- it's a sci-fi movie. But it's a good flawed! Serenity is a ride that you get onto when the movie begins and that you get off of when the ending credits roll. You want to know what's going to happen! A couple of reviews have said that you won't get it if you didn't watch ""Firefly"", but I didn't have that problem at all. If you think about it, everything makes sense, even if this is your first introduction to the story. Serenity does a great job of not being confusing to those of us who are just meeting Captain Mal and crew; but still adding tons of ""inside"" jokes and continuances for those who loved ""Firefly"". The acting was good, the actors seemed to actually a) enjoy their characters (*gasp!*) b) enjoy working together (*double gasp!*). Everyone fit together really well. The writing was good (a tiny bit cheesy, but that's only to be expected), with no plot holes that I noticed. It even managed to get pretty deep with a well put message/moral. I know what your thinking, ""A message in a sci-fi movie? Is she crazy?"" but hey, it's there.I know that not everyone is going to like Serenity. And that's fine. It's not for everyone. If your not a sci-fi/fantasy/action/adventure sort of person, you won't like it. And you won't like it if your offended by ""gratuitous violence"". But for those of us who enjoy/don't mind these things -- Serenity rocks. Definitely a solid 9/10.",Serenity
287,ericzillazillo,7.9 Score Justified,7,24 September 2013,"IMDb has been known for the notorious ridiculous scores awarded to films that people, for whatever reason -nostalgia, fanboyism, some dumb moral in the film - decided to award films a 10/10. After all, NO film is perfect enough for a score of 10.That said, if you were to rate Serenity a 10, I wouldn't blame you. Because it is awesome (for the most part).Visually, the spaceship scenes are not too impressive- What you'd expect from a modern (2013) video game. But they are real enough for a suspension of disbelief. The film is up to feature film standards, nothing to complain about.For the storyline, while being slightly annoyed at the character's constant refusal to say ""goddam"", I still appreciate the naturalism employed by the film - it for the most part doesn't shy away from boldly murdering people on camera, and the violence, dark atmosphere and harsh mature realism is a refreshing experience compared to the conventional PG-13 pollution. While I personally had already watched the TV series before watching the film, I can safely say that this film is like the Han Solo film you always wanted - can't give away the plot but I can say that the film would have done equally well under a Star Wars license using Star Wars characters.There are some plot holes, but nothing the film can't bluff its way out of if it tried. And the film only gets better with the context of the TV series which I highly recommend watching before you watch Serenity.The acting is alright, the fight scenes are pretty mediocre. One thing that's always bothered me throughout both Firefly and Serenity is that the Chinese language is never used normally, always used when a character is presumably using strong language or frustrated or trying to put emphasis on something, almost as if Chinese were a native language that characters revert to when they aren't calm enough to speak civilized. Yet the Chinese pronunciations are about as spot on as accidental U.S. drone strikes on civilians, I have trouble understanding what characters are saying and it has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that I myself am Chinese.Anyway. It's got flaws, that's why I personally only rate it a 7. Still more than you can say for any other Sci-Fi film past or present. While personally Starship Troopers replaced Star Wars a long time ago, I am sure that you will find Serenity a place in your heart where Star Wars once was, and be so overwhelmed with its awesomeness that you too will rate the film a 10/10.",Serenity
288,three_am,AUTOMATIC LOVE FOR THIS MOVIE (Spoilers Here),10,25 October 2005,"Serenity was a great movie with some very choice moments. I enjoyed all the actors, the story, the special effects, and the vision of the future. It was a delight to be introduced to various characters, I thought they represented realistic people. I totally admire Joss Whedon's creation of the Serenity 'verse (I love that phrase), his imagination and writing. Those choice moments I was talking about: (SPOILERS HERE)At the end, when Mal asks Inara where she wanted to be, her answer was ""I don't know"" and Mal remarks, ""Good Answer."" - Such a simple scene yet has so much meaning. Because really, what person truly knows where he/she wants to be?When Simon tells Kaylee his one regret was not being with her. Kaylee's face when she says ""Sex?"" Simon's nod and her reaction of ""the hell with this, I'm gonna live"" and she cocks the gun. It was cute, it made me laugh.All the fight scenes. River kicks butt and watching her wound Jayne cracked me up. If anyone saw the Firefly series, the one scene in the episode ""Trash"" where River teases Jayne about his name being a girls name had me chuckling.Those Reaver ships were expertly menacing. Really cool.I loved the beginning chase scene with the reaver ship chasing the crew on the mule. I was reminded of Star Wars in this scene.Overall, the movie was excellent and anyone who likes Sci-Fi would love this movie. I loved the humor in this story and the dialogue of the characters. I recommend watching the Firefly series too.",Serenity
289,Theoron,Easily the BEST film of 2005 so far...,10,2 October 2005,"""nonviolence implies a kind of bravery far different from violence. In the use of force, one simplifies the situation by assuming that the evil to be overcome is clear-cut, definite, and irreversible. Hence there remains but one thing: to eliminate it. Any dialogue with the sinner, any question of the irreversibility of his act, only means faltering and failure. Failure to eliminate evil is itself a defeatThe greatest of tyrannies are all therefore based on the postulate that there should never be any sin."" (Thomas Merton) ""Serenity"" has more laughs than the best comedy, more action than the action flicks, and more substance than all the films released this year combined. Does it sound like I'm gushing? If it does, I must say this is one film worth gushing over.Take all the movies of 2005, roll them up into a ball, and you still wouldn't get from that big wad of celluloid an entertainment experience that Serenity effortlessly offers up in any random ten minutes of viewing. Yes, the film is THAT GOOD.The setting is a system of terra-formed planets somewhere in the galaxy, at at time 500 years in the future. Bullet firing sidearms are still the weapon of choice, and we get a very interesting mix of sci-fi high-tech mixed in with and old-west type of atmosphere. Think of ""Star Wars"" crossed with ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly."" The plot: Serenity is the name of a space ship captained by Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), a veteran of a civil war in which the Independents, or ""Browncoats"" (which he volunteered for) fought against the Alliance, which is similar, but not identical to the Rebel/Empire thing of Star Wars. But the Alliance is actually more like the Federation of the Star Trek franchise, without the alien life forms.Reynolds fought for a single ideal: freedom to choose his own way of life. The Alliance is one of those capitalist/socialist conglomerations that seek to smother their citizens in an abundance of regulation and a promise to shelter everyone from all evil. Mal, and his sidekick Zoe (Gina Torres), who fought alongside Mal in the civil war, both realize it is better to die free than to live enslaved to a system that thinks it knows better than you do. Though the war is over, Mal and Zoe continue their own private little war against the Alliance by running a Robin Hood style outlaw organization that steels from the Alliance and gives to Serenity's crew. Think of it as a bit of pay-back for the hell the war put them through.In it's adventures, Serenity picks up a doctor and his sister as passengers. It is only after they are aboard does the reality of their situation becomes known: they are fugitives on the run from the Alliance. The doctor's young sister, River (Summer Glau), who at one time was a brilliant student, was taken under false pretenses by the Alliance and mentally ""re-engineered"" to become a lethal weapon, in order to be used covertly against those hold-outs still bucking Alliance control. The young doctor, Simon (Sean Maher), uses all his money and influence in a plot to rescue his sister from the facility where she is being programmed, and the two of them make a run for it; Simon all the while trying to do what he can to help his now deranged sister regain her mental faculties.Yet the Alliance is finally catching up to these two renegades, and it's up to Mal Reynolds and the small crew of the Serenity to keep the doctor and his sister out of their clutches.While this might seem like just a sci-fi version of ""The Fugitive"", it is in reality much more than that. All really good science fiction is far more than just aliens and special effects, it is an examination of core philosophical and theological ideals which makes society what it is. In this film we areamazinglytreated to a meditation on the meaning of love; and a blatant example of the fallacy that sin (evil) can be removed from a society through political/scientific endeavors.The Alliance, in their bid to create the perfect Utopia, finds that they have created a horrendous hell instead. River, through her mind-reading ability, inadvertently discovers the Alliance's closet full of skeletons. It is the possible unmasking of this closely guarded secret that makes River and her brother high priority targets. It's hard to convince people that you are the ultimate system of benevolence when the hard evidence of social experimentation gone wrong demonstrates the opposite.I don't know the political or religious ideals of Joss Whedon, the writer and director of this film, but one cannot help but to notice that Serenity is a powerful body-slam to the modern day liberal ideologues who think the road to perfect peace and happiness can be found in the next government social welfare program. It shows the empty promise of political utopias in a way that is so powerful, it will be a wonder if a left-wing, anti-war do-gooder will be able to withstand watching this film without self-destructing. We plainly see, just as we did in the classic film ""Forbidden Planet,"" or in the wonderful book ""1984,"" that the road to a political Utopia is paved with far more violence than that it seeks to eradicate.For that alone, Serenity is the best film of the year, and easily one of the best films in the past five years.I plan on seeing this film several more times; and I almost NEVER seen a film more than once in a theater. I may even go so far as to buy double the number of tickets I need, just because this movie is worth double the ticket price, even triple. Yeah, it's THAT GOOD.My score: 20 out of 10.",Serenity
290,AJx91,Space Cowboys,9,28 July 2021,"This was Sci-fi/Space Western/Cowboys with some serious horror elements. You are going to feel scared sometimes. Keep in mind, this isn't hard sci-fi, it will be soft sci-fi. So don't judge it too hard on that.This wraps up the live action version of Firefly. And I can understand why people are mad and gave it a lower rating. But this was the best Josh could do, with the season 2 being cancelled.I couldn't give it a perfect 10, the ending was sad. Wouldn't have felt as bad if they did a season 2, before this ending.The next step is, you guys can read the comics.",Serenity
291,sd-forum,I know why Serenity was not successful...,6,16 July 2013,"No Spoilers here: I'm a huge fan of the Firefly and I was greatly disappointed by Serenity.Fans with their support gave a chance to the makers to make a movie out of the canceled show but I believe Joss Whedon misfired and killed that chance. It's no wonder that it had no success because the movie is not accessible and fun. It's like a bleak dark sci-fi Buffy in space. Looks like they forgot what made Firefly so great. Firefly is a bright adventurous western in space with funny dialogs.The movie is not accessible and no fun. Imagine someone who has never seen Firefly, s/he would never feel the need to see the series. I, who have seen all the episodes, didn't enjoy it, let alone someone new.It had none of the Firefly elements. The characters' interactions. I feel like if they had made a real fun bright western/heist/Indy movie in space, it would have been more successful. And that would have been a great way to get new audiences. You watch the movie and you don't see the same interaction/fun the characters had in the series. When Shepherd is not on the ship, you know something is wrong.Major spoilers here: And don't get me started on killing 2 of your major characters. This is not a heavy, one shot drama where you can kill people off. This is a long, fun series and killing 2 of your major characters is just a turn off and not a source of drama. And I did read the reasons Whedon gives for killing them but again it's just bad excuse. They could have survived and not appear in the second movie.",Serenity
292,beeryusa,Nowhere near as bad as some critics suggest.,8,2 January 2006,"Many of the negative reviewers here (e.g. A real look at Serenity, 6 October 2005) choose to review based purely on the reviews of the so-called 'fanboys' - they cite Citizen Kane as if the movie ever purported to be in that class - it didn't. As well as forgetting to review the film at all, they knock off an extra 4 stars or so, presumably to 'even out' the excessive '10 out of 10' votes that others have given. As such, they become part of the same problem they're railing against. If only everyone would review and rate movies fairly, the system would work properly. Anyway, if I go on, my review will become part of the same issue, and I don't want mine to be solely a reaction to negative reviewers.This is a good Sci-Fi film. Sure, it has some plot holes and some disappointing plot choices were made, especially towards the end where the film appears rushed. But there's a lot to like in this film too. I was not a Firefly fan before seeing the film - I had only ever seen one episode - but the film was good enough to prompt me to buy the DVD of the series, and now my wife and I are definitely fans.As I said before, this film is not trying to be Citizen Kane or The Godfather. What it does try to be is the equivalent of a Star Trek movie. As such, Serenity succeeds far better than most of the Star Trek movies, and perhaps even better than the better Star Trek films such as Wrath of Khan. After having watched Firefly (the series) I have to say that like many Fox shows that were cancelled before they had a chance (anyone remember Profit?) this show deserves a break, and Serenity is good enough to perhaps get some network executives to give it a second chance, or perhaps we could see another movie. Either way, I'll look forward to it.",Serenity
293,LaDonnaKeskes,Who cares about special effects?,10,2 October 2005,"****MILD SPOILER****I've never seen Firefly and completely enjoyed this movie. Some reviews say the special effects were bad--but I never noticed. Just a great, engaging roller coaster ride with plenty of good-looking people and real emotion in it. I was constantly snapped up by the clean crisp dialogue and changing perspectives in the first minutes of the movie. The opening sequence was great. River's comment after they escape the first Reaver attack was terrific.I've never been a Buffy or Angel watcher, but I may revisit those shows too.Everyone should write to FOX and demand that the series be returned to the air for a special showing.",Serenity
294,nannyjo,This Movie May Not Be For You,3,19 November 2005,"I have to say that I was displeased by this movie.Due to the things that happened in it, I now have trouble watching the show again. So many scenes that I watched originally that were full of hope and good expectations THEN, I really can't stand watching now that I know none of them will ever come true. Without the movie, I could believe that the characters all lived ""happily ever after"" somehow. Now I know that isn't the case and I honestly wish that I hadn't gone to see it. Such a waste of what could/should have been.This is all just my own opinion and ties in with what makes a good movie in my own mind. THIS was not one of them. I just can't get over a few events and those few moments...seconds really... just ruined everything for me.If you are a fan of happy endings, this movie ISN'T for you.",Serenity

296,T1Thousand,Battle on Serenity,7,5 October 2005,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. That is my remark for all the immense praises on this board. Let me get this out of the way first--the movie was all right. It was way better than I expected. But all these OUTSTANDING remarks? Come on, now. It was because of these remarks that I expected a masterpiece, a classic. But instead I only saw a different and fun science fiction film. Comments like ""Best movie of the year"" just cause me to shake my head because--off the top of my head--I can think of five movies that came out this year that are better than this. Sure this was entertaining and a good sci-fi overall (and I am not a big sci-fi freak), but that is pretty much it. There is no sense of character in these people except for River and the Operator. I did not really care what happened to anyone else. The concept of this movie is good though. The battle is not only on the ship Serenity, but also FOR serenity in the universe. The acting was so-so except again for the ones mentioned above. There was good humor, great special effects, fascinating action scenes, and pretty good direction. It is a bit slow for the first half an hour or so, but then it picks up there and gets better. These people who praise this movie like it is the god of films just make me think that they are movie studio plants. Over half of them only reviewed THIS MOVIE. But anyway, aside from that, this movie was okay. If you are a science fiction fan, there is a high chance that you will like this movie. Everyone else will at least be entertained because this show is not bad at all =) 6.6/10 Stars",Serenity
297,kaylenns,"Smart, Powerful, & Funny",10,1 October 2005,"This big-screen Firefly episode met all of my expectations and exceeded them spectactularly. It really grew to fill the big screen and surpassed just being another TV episode. I laughed, I (nearly) cried, I whooped with exhilaration and so (it seemed) did everyone else in the theatre with me. The acting and writing were excellent, the story and pacing really kept me engaged: even when I could see a plot point coming, it still came satisfyingly. There are maybe one or two SFX awkwardnesses, but they were by no means enough to take away from my enjoyment of this movie. The characters were well drawn and consistent with the series and the struggles that they went through (not just the fighting, but also the internal battles) were compelling. This movie functions both as a satisfying end to a brilliant TV show and just the beginning of an exciting universe of possibilities (I'm hoping someone picks the show up again!) This movie is well worth your time and money even if you haven't watched the show--you don't need to have seen the show to enjoy this movie--and I encourage you to see it! I'm planning on organizing some friends and going to see it again!",Serenity
298,cracker,Mediocre; user ratings here have become a compromised race to the bottom,3,26 October 2005,"The mind-boggling comments here about ""Serenity"" have brought me out of a 2-year user comment hibernation, primarily because they caused me to waste time and money on a mediocre movie. Do not be fooled as I was.Evaluated as a movie, the script, characterization and acting are bland, similar to what one expects from a sub-par TV pilot. The editing is outright incompetent (I suspect a halfway decent movie could be salvaged from the cutting room floor). Others who call the movie boring here (in the deep pages I never reached before going to the theater) are correct. The only interesting character is the Confucian agent sent by the Alliance (who disappoints in the end by capriciously setting aside his duty; his ilk would have been culled out rather quickly in black-ops school).As science fiction, the movie is laughably bad (but unfortunately not laughable enough to be campy) for many reasons; I will list only a few: A society capable of terraforming worlds is still using machine guns, is incapable of tagging and tracking a valuable commodity to the centimeter (a psychic would certainly be valuable), is conducting mass illicit experiments on its citizens to increase their docility(why? wouldn't a terraforming, presumably nanotech capable society be a little past this?), sends out a large military force under the sole control of a black-ops operative (rofl; that is almost campy), etc. and there are many, many etc's in this movie.There is lots of StarWars ripoff here too, and whereas that franchise is targeted specifically at children, this movie, presumably targeted at adults can't pull it off. There is not one whit of ""charm"" or ""cool factor"" in this movie. It is clunky and bland from start to finish. We don't even get to ""see"" the Reavers doing any real reaving for goodness sakes (why didn't the Reavers kill each other off pretty darn quickly? is there a ""smart"" Reaver? who knows, who cares), nor in a post-matrix world do we see nearly enough ""badass"" from the River character.IMO, most of the hype posters here are likely young fanbois (and probably mostly fangirls) of the Buffy and Angel TV series and are completely ignorant of science fiction and of what makes a good movie. Sorry to be blunt and insulting, but I am annoyed at you all for wasting my time and money.",Serenity

It is a shock to the system that this movie could be rated so highly after so many years. Barnum was right, that no one ever lost money through underestimating the taste of the American public.

302,larson.72,Don't believe the hype,5,3 October 2005,"I can't begin to fathom how this movie has an 8.6 out of 10 as of this writing.Firstly, the plot of Serenity is tenuous at best. Most of the cast basically just serves as screen fodder for the first half of the movie, plodding along to different and seemingly random locales delivering poorly acted and sometimes incomprehensible dialog (subtitles maybe?), while the main story slowly takes shape in the background. After about an hour you'll find yourself saying: where is this going? Thankfully, it does eventually go somewhere, and the movie does improve somewhat in the second half, but even when the plot does pick up, the movie still can't overcome the other main hurdle: very bad acting and questionable dialog. Not once did I find any of the characters convincing enough to suspend my disbelief that I was watching a low-rent sci-fi movie. In a nutshell, the movie basically just comes off exactly as it is (or should have been): a made-for-TV movie that inexplicably made it's way to your local movie theater.As I left the theater after seeing this movie, I couldn't help but think of some of the stalwarts of the science fiction movie genre - Star Wars, Alien, Terminator, 2001, Blade Runner, and how utterly superior those movies are to this film, in terms of plot, acting, pacing, and dialog. There's just no comparison. I also couldn't help but think of all the brilliant science fiction novels that are waiting to be adapted into movies that would probably be superior to this one even in the hands of an average director.In conclusion, don't believe the hype of fanboys - this movie is average at best. After seeing it, I think there's a reason the TV series it was based on was cancelled after 11 episodes...",Serenity
303,Jisk,This is not a good movie,5,20 January 2006,"I remember seeing this film when I was a kid called ""Space Voyagers"" or something like that. It was kind of a 'B' movie version of a Star Wars film. When I saw it, I knew what I was getting into: an enjoyably cruddy retelling of adventures I was already familiar with.'Serenity' is not like 'Space Voyagers' at all. I didn't know what to expect from the vaguely nebulous poster. A girl mostly in shadow; a man's expressionless face, etc. The reason why I saw the movie was because of the previews: Cool! A space movie! I thought. Those are pretty good special effects. And is that witty dialogue I hear? But, no, it was unfortunately not. The most pervasive thought I had throughout the film was, ""this is bad - why does it have an 8.0 on the IMDb?"" --And it really is a terrible film. It plays out like a half-baked Sci-Fi Channel series long-since canceled. Bad Acting. Terrible Dialogue. Unbelievably cheesy situations. Ugh. I guess it makes sense, considering it's basically the final episode of a TV series I never saw (Firefly), but still- I expect better from a FEATURE FILM. This movie would have been so much better if they made it deliberately cheesy/funny/campy, but no...they made a self-important, boring mess instead. Oh Well. 5/10",Serenity
304,Twilight_Wraith,At best... mediocre,1,31 August 2008,"I don't know what hold Joss Whedon has over his fans, but he has made the most dull and shallow characters i've ever seen in the film Serenity. Apparently a girl is holding a secret and that secret is... too mind-numbingly uninspired to tell. Yes, she kicks ass and there are ""revears"" who go around killing everybody. There are space battles to be sure but mostly every action scene is a fist in the face knockdown drag out that is a veritable yawn each time. Who is this assassin anyway sent to kill these rebels? Who cares anyway? He's like the rebels. He's got no personality and he's about as deep as a kiddy pool. The story is suitable for movie of the week, but not a theatrical film. The characters are all stereotypes and argue way too often. I'll tell you right now that Joss Whedon strove for scientific accuracy when it comes to space physics and noises in the vacuum of it. Again, so what? This is called Science Fiction for a reason, because it doesn't follow the rules. If we wanted a completely scientifically accurate movie they'd call it ""Science Fact"". Joss Whedon really under thought this movie. He didn't spend enough time fleshing out the characters and writing a good enough story for the transition between TV show and theatrical movie. I expect better when people make the bold proclamation ""This is one of the best science fiction movies ever!"". Nope, not even close. I'd rather watch Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Don't bother with Serenity, it is remarkably boring.",Serenity
305,mobile912,"I agree with many, Watch Fire-Fly again! And then watch this",8,24 October 2020,I'm going to take a weekend and re watch the first and only season. BTW it turned out to be one of the biggest travesties to ever take place in fake Hollywood. They cancelled one of the best series ever created! I would love to know who was behind that decision.,Serenity
306,jack_thursby,Good... but comes across like a TV movie of the week,8,18 October 2005,"""Serenity"" tells the story of a psychic teenage girl named River (Summer Glau) and a group of space pirates (not evil space pirates, nice space pirates!) who help her out. Apparently the movie is based on a TV show but I never saw the show and I didn't know about it until after I saw the movie.River was being turned into a human weapon by a group of scientists working for the Alliance, a group of planets trying to conquer the galaxy for the betterment of all. The Alliance was fighting a group called The Independents. River gets a little messed up by the drugs and psychological training the Alliance scientists give her. Simon (Sean Maher), River's brother, rescues her and they hook up with the space pirates to make their escape. The Alliance sends a ""don't mess with me"" type of dude to get River back.... and then the action starts.Well, if you thought that was a lot of exposition for a movie review, wait until you see the movie. Exposition-lovers, the first 20 minutes of this film will be heaven for you. For me, not so much. But the movie did turn out to be pretty good and it was an enjoyable sci-fi flick. I've seen a lot of sci-fi movies and this was definitely one of the better ones.The only problem I had with the film was its ""tv movie of the week"" feel. Everything just seemed like it was made for the small screen -- I'm talking about the lack of production values, the good-but-not-quite-there acting and the effective but unimaginative cinematography. For example, there's some cool fighting sequences, but they would have been a lot more exciting and tense with better fighting choreography, some effects and maybe some tighter editing. They just didn't have the budget and the movie loses something because of it.Still, I was pulled into the story and ended up caring about the characters so ""Serenity"" rates an 8/10. Hopefully they'll greenlight the sequel with a much bigger budget to make the movie that this story deserves.",Serenity
307,redsoxmb545-1,Pleasantly Surprising,8,6 May 2006,"Serenity is a movie based on a TV show that was canceled after 7 episodes, so naturally, I wasn't expecting much. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The beginning caught my attention, the middle was a tiny bit tedious, but not too bad. But the ending sequence(s) were very thrilling. The film is actually quite funny, which I completely wasn't expecting. Including the captain saying via intercom to the entire crew, ""We'll be experiencing some slight turbulence and then, uh...explode"". The plot is about a space captain and his crew. They transport people through space and this time, their passengers are a doctor and his telepathic and kinda mentally wacko sister. The bad guys are a group called the Allience (wow, never heard that one before), a government system that's out of control. Their leader kinda reminds me of a young Morpheus (from the Matrix).The reavers are also bad guys and they are cannibalistic humans who have gone completely F-ing crazy. The crew of the Serenity ship rebel against the bad guys. Guess what happens.",Serenity
308,drgrozozo,Brilliant!,9,2 October 2008,"I for one didn't watch ""Firefly"" series, nor did I bother to check who is the writer or the director of this movie prior to watching. And as I haven't seen space movie in a long time, I would be grateful even if it was half-decent flick, and this one didn't promise much...It turned out to be a real gem, with greatest strength in most important segments - story doesn't follow any clichés, dialogs are masterfully written, played and directed, and visuals don't reveal budget. I even dare to say that this movie would work just as well if it was made with zero budget, that is the difference of having a story and just trashing effects around in a hope you will make a film.I guess the important directors decision to make story flow rich and realistic without explaining every single scene to viewers like they were a bunch of brain-dead morons, didn't went well with brain-dead morons, hence the low box office success. Nevertheless, this movie deserves it's place high among the greatest of a genre, nodding to classics here and there but steering far away from plagiarism, bringing freshness and uniqueness that spell love for art more than money.Timeless.",Serenity
309,anarresa,See this movie.,8,30 September 2005,"I've never felt the need to write a comment before, but this movie was so fantastic I need to convince people to see it. I notice the high marks it received before it opened, and took it with a grain of salt, knowing it was the true fanatics. They were absolutely right. I'm not sure how to categorize Serenity. The action was first-rate and beautifully shot/effected (think Batman Begins). The fight scenes were well choreographed, fun and intense (think Gladiator). It was clever and witty, sometimes poetic, and sometimes teasing itself for the poetry (sorry, no comparison). I was actually SHOCKED (along with the rest of the theater that audibly gasped) at one point, it wasn't a twist or loud noise that horror movies use to get you, it was a true surprise (I'll say no more). I gave it a 9 because it is set in space/the future, and because it is a sci-fi movie there are those who will refuse to watch it. Their loss. It's not necessary at all to have seen the TV show (Firefly), so don't be put off, you may even go buy it just so you can have more. To put the rating in perspective I gave movies such as the Godfather and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead scores of 9. Good company.",Serenity
310,Efenstor,A big space adventure,5,15 November 2005,"My word of the thoughtful-yet-entertaining movie gentleman, ""Serenity"" is the one of the best sci-fi movies of the recent years. It's a very very good big space adventure. Original plot with very natural turns with very few the clichés (though there could be more turns and a bit less talk), no claptrap Lord-of-the-Rings-like sentiments but sincere senses, thoughts and even some good yet unobtrusive philosophy, and live and believable CGI's with the atmosphere! This is really the space sci-fi for all who dislike Star Wars for their ""mechanicalism"" and lifelessness of the environment, all the environments here are really live. In fact this is the only movie where I actually felt the spaceship flying, not the screens behind the windows! In whole, there are many many different elusive well-balanced details in the plot, in the characters and their behavior and in the scenery that are giving the whole movie an extraordinary believability. And yet it's pure entertainment, it's not a sort of heavy saga. It's just made with a head on the shoulders, not like the main load of movies are being made today. Good, very good entertainment movie. In the line with ""I, Robot"". 9/10.",Serenity
311,PopcornLovesMovie,"You have to watch ""Firefly"" series first before watching this!",10,6 January 2010,"I made a grave mistake of not knowing that this movie was based on the series ""Firefly"". I believe it's the highest rated TV show on IMDb.Honestly, the first time I watch Serenity, I got bored. But that's only because I haven't watch ""firefly"". I didn't get the characters and the storyline seems confusing. But once I watch the entire Firefly series, this is like a new movie to me. It's highly exciting, humorous and emotional all at once.The only thing I regret is them taking out one of the crew. It lessen the chance of the series getting back on the air. A lot of fans are still hoping they would continue Firefly because it honestly deserve its standing as the highest rated show on IMDb.",Serenity
312,CIMC,"""Hell with this. I wanna live!""",9,12 October 2005,"Blind faith is hazardous to morality. It allows all kinds of awfulness to take place with a minimum of resistance. If you are sure that what you believe in is righteous, what is done to uphold that belief, however terrible, becomes much more palatable. The danger that is blind faith is personified by The Operative in the excellent new Joss Whedon space opera Serenity. Played with perfection by Chiwetel Ejiofor he is a soldier for the Alliance, the governing body of a solar system colonized by Earthlings. The governance of the Alliance is not welcomed by all despite the modern amenities that come with it. As such it is the job of ""believers"", people like The Operative, to subdue threats to the Alliance's power. It is not that The Operative is a flawed being so much as he is a man who put his faith in something before he knows the whole picture. ""What I do is evil, I have no illusions about it,"" The Operative declares. He believes in the Alliance so though evil it may be, ""it must be done.""His target in Serenity is River Tam (Summer Glau), a ""psychic weapon"" created by the Alliance and freed by her brother Simon (Sean Maher). Simon is a medic aboard Cpt.. Malcolm Reynolds' Serenity. ""Mal"" (Nathan Fillion) is an ex-soldier and now more of a soldier of fortune. The Alliance fears that River's psychic abilities have allowed her access to some damaging information. While Mal knows that something's not right with the girl, he doesn't know exactly what it is that plagues her, nor does she. The ensuing action is a struggle to find out, and comes to terms with that knowledge.The cast of relative unknowns achieves this with ease. Whatever flaws they might have as performers, as a group they have an undeniable chemistry. They are comfortable with Whedon's style and his one liners that pop up throughout the film. Whedon knows enough about storytelling to know that a quick punch line can both be comedic and add poignancy to a dramatic scene. Especially good is a line from Kaylee (Jewel Staite) at a moment when when it appears all hope is lost. Needless to say hope is not lost, it just required the proper motivation. The special effects are competent if not perfect and Summer Glau is a graceful as one would expect from a trained ballerina in dealing out spectacularly choreographed beatdowns, a task Ejiofor performs with skill as well. Those dead and defeated at the hands of The Operative, River and others are not let go lightly. Whether at the killed by the good guys or the villains it's nice to see that even minor characters do not pass gently into that good night. The Operative, conscious of his beastly actions, does not shy away from the deaths he causes. He faces them down and though he does not wince or hesitate, it's clear that he doesn't accept it as right. Coming from a villain, that's a welcome vision. In a climatic battle that would seem to be Awful vs. Terrible, both Mal and The Operative are quick to point out that those doing the actual fighting are innocent though they are dying at the hands of each other, and they're both right.Misguided faith and collateral damage are not the only relevant topics Whedon has on his mind. The basis of the conflict between the Alliance and the outer planets is one of meddling in the affairs of others. The believers have no problem with the cause of the Alliance for a variety of reasons, all wrongheaded. Whether wanting to civilize the savages or bring an Alliance-style peace, the intrusions are not welcomed. A child says it best in the film, people do not like to be meddled with, no matter the intentions of the meddlers. In extending the policies and values of the Alliance over the wishes of those who would prefer their own path the Alliance stirs up a hornet's nest that makes any previous danger pale in comparison. American policy makers would do well to note the final theme of the film: Trying to force a Pax Americana on folks that do not want it will bring no meaningful kind of peace to anyone.",Serenity
313,sschimel,Waaay better than Star Wars,10,16 October 2005,"I have to say that I never watched the series because I didn't have Cable TV while it was on. I think I need to rent it now so I can get the back story. I will say this, though. The movie didn't require having watched the series to make sense. Also, the acting and writing were really first rate. It may not have been as huge a movie as the Star War movies were, in terms of settings or special effects, but it was far and away a superior movie experience. AFter the months and months of seeing that %#&@ing trailer at the movie theater announcing the impending release of the movie, and how wildly successful the previews had been, I was disappointed to see in a magazine this week that the movie appears to be flopping at the box office. C'mon people! A horrible movie like the last StarWars makes 400,000,000.00 and a great movie like this only makes 18,000,000.00? I guess I've officially become a ""Browncoat"".",Serenity
314,myschrec,Intelligent sci-fi adventure with the right blend of humor,10,10 October 2005,"For sophisticated and jaded 21st century movie audiences, this film has the appropriate blend of action, sci-fi, comedy and anti-authority to make it fun and keep my attention every minute. There is a lot of predictability, but the thrill is seeing HOW the plot plays out. There is a core mystery that keeps you intrigued until the last twenty minutes -- and then the fight scenes are enough to carry the film to the end. The characters are iconic and slightly thin -- but the acting is believable and empathetic, with a quip now and then to show a side to a character that you'd like to explore in -- dare I say - a sequel. There are noticeable moments of profundity, like the brief discussions about who gets saved and the villain's obsession with ""falling on one's sword."" Fortunately these deep issues are raised subtly and never resolved. One pleasant surprise is the humor -- at times deadpan, insulting, risqué, subtle and/or quick. This film is worth repeat viewings -- especially on the big screen where the action and outer space scenes enhance the experience.",Serenity
315,piratecat-2,TV Small Screen to THE BIG DAMN MOVIE,10,1 January 2007,"Browncoat fans know what I mean. You take a short lived TV series Firefly, kill it way to soon. Ya better put it on the big screen. We need two more films or another series. That is how browncoat fans are fan-at-tic. Yepper. What a great fast action space western. I loved the show and a miracle happen and my love continues to grow for the show with the BDM. We picked up where the series stopped. The mystery unfolds about River Tam. Stands are made. The crew of the little Firefly transport Serenity are in harms way they don't blink and do what it takes to hide the Tams. Eventually we know where this will lead are crew on a heralding adventure. Superb visual and special effects with action of the ole west who could ask for a better film on the big screen. A cult favorite on a bladerunner status the story matches with the empire strikes back. I cannot say enough how riveted I was in my seat at the theater. This is a saga that you either get or hit the bricks. The characters are not programed from some academy to make milestones in the history of the universe. They are the common folk who want to live. They know the value of life is cheap on their end. Family is what its about and keeping that family together. A captain with aiding a little broken girl will find his path again. Redemtion from losing his faith. All this while burning through atmo from one perdicament from another. Guns ablazing when all else fails. Loved it. Where are all are heroes gone.

316,derboiler,Not to be missed!,10,7 January 2006,"This is simply the sci-fi movie and the best movie I saw in 2005. The movie reflects what good movies are made of: Interesting plot, nice pace and fascinating characters. The characters in this movie are the heart and soul of this flick. Everyone of them has a good story to tell and is perfectly casted. The movie is a thrilling mixture of sci-fi, action, drama, comedy and soap opera. The director is able to provide us with a fine and understandable movie even for those who haven't seen the series. If you know the TV-Series Firefly you'll get some more details about the plot and the characters behavior's. But as said it is not required to enjoy a fun and thrilling ride on this one. My greatest wish would be that more movies likes this would be produced. Not the CGI-Blasting experiences that we have seen and grown tired of. No. This one has what other movies missed completely: It has a soul and has everything needed to fascinate every sci-fi fan out there. Watch, sit back and have fun!My Rating 10/10",Serenity
317,garboventures,Reasonably entertaining,9,17 October 2005,"This was a reasonably enjoyable if not scintillating way to spend a night at the cinema. I went to see Serenity with minimal expectations - I had never seen Firefly on TV - although I had heard good things. This is not a great Sci-Fi movie, and is closer (as reviewers point out) in mood and feel and narrative structure to a typical Western - but set in Space (and some indeterminate future).It took me some time to understand Nathan Fillion who stars as 'Mal' because he is an inveterate mumbler, but I eventually got the hang of it, and once I did I enjoyed his role. Adam Baldwin as Jayne had me sniggering throughout - definitely my favourite character. The doctor (Sean Maher) was a little dull, Kaylee (Jewel Staite) was a lot spunkier and convincing and the Goth super-teen River (Summer Glau) had her moments. The husband and wife Wash (Alan Tudyk) and Zoe (Gina Torres) were strong characterisations - Zoe in particular. However, the inclusion of Inara (Morena Baccarin) was a total waste of time and space. It was clear that she was Mal's love-interest (though not properly explored - but clearly being set up as an ongoing on-off love affair throughout the franchise zzzz) and could (kind of) kick butt as she lures the baddie into a trap, but her character was hugely under-developed and merely involved her wafting around prettily in impractical clothing.The big bad secret (without going into details here) was disappointing and poorly executed - cheap sets, cheap 'effects', cheap dummies, space-ships which look like kiddie models, and some dodgy plot-lines; this has been called a Star Wars for adults, but in fact Serenity just seems to rip off elements of its infinitely better precursor. I guess Serenity is supposed to be akin to (pre-Leia) Han Solo's perspective.Despite these faults, which cannot be ignored, the film is fun enough and certainly worth a look, if only for the absolutely stonking performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor as The Operative - the cold-blooded baddie. I have never yet seen Ejiofor fumble in any role, he is a superlative actor. David Krumholtz as Mr Universe was a cute enough comic cameo; he could thrive with bigger, meatier material.",Serenity

And a thoroughly childish attempt to turn this into a ""love story"".I can truly think of no better parallel than this: Serenity is sci-fi for the Twilight generation.A mediocre movie with all the personality of tepid dishwater.",Serenity

321,NickDeckard,I was expecting a lot more than this....,5,7 April 2006,"As a sci-fi freak I was really really hoping that this would be good...and I was really really disappointed.I admit to never watching Firefly, which is a big disadvantage watching this film because it seemed to assume that whoever was watching this must have seen Firefly - in fact the whole film does seem to be a cut down TV series to be honest.Too many clichés, too many unexplained plot lines, it managed to send my brother (also a sci-fi freak) and his girlfriend (a Buffy/Angel freak) to sleep. I battled to the end and was left thinking ""Oh - is that it?"". I really cannot understand all the praise it has had - I would advise anyone who hasn't seen the new Battlestar Galactica to go and rent out that instead - its far far better than this and much more exciting!",Serenity
322,knight110tim,Shiny!,10,29 December 2005,"A sublime lesson in storytelling, not a line is wasted in Joss Whedon's directorial debut - Serenity. Although a continuation of his prematurely axed sci-fi TV show, Firefly, the film is completely self-contained, introducing the major players and the background in a quick, efficient style that will entertain Browncoats (die-hard Firefly fans) and new recruits to the 'Verse (the setting).While the story revolves around the activities of Captain Mal Reynolds and his crew, the plot focuses on 17-year-old psychic River Tam, a typical Joss kick-ass hottie ... shades of his most famous creation, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, but without the supernatural monsters! The only monsters in Serenity are the Reavers, insane humans into self-mutilation, cannibalism and other icky things.While mainly an unseen, but still terrifying, threat in the TV series, the Reavers are a strong force throughout the film; being the power-engine driving the greatest 'last stand' gun battle since Zulu.Mal and his crew are petty thieves, trying to earn a crust and keep flyin' - more Han Solo than Captain Kirk - and so their escapades are, by default, more down and dirty, more dangerous and people die ... including crew members and supporting cast. But if you've only joined them for this flight, and not earned your Browncoat yet, you will care about their loss and the impact it has on the rest of this close-knit family.Filmed on a comparatively small budget, with faultless special effects, Serenity is a masterclass in mainstream film-making, bringing a genre movie to the general public in an easily-digestible form. Let's hope it now makes enough money to warrant a highly anticipated sequel.Joss is an amazing writer - I can't think of anyone else in the industry who can do characters and dialogue as well, but be warned the 'Verse is very plot-driven, not science-driven and so it pays not to think too hard on some of the physics (there are plenty of message boards on the Internet and podcasts to discuss such trivia ad nauseum); just sit back and enjoy the ride.",Serenity
323,say_andy,The sci-fi movie that neither the Star Wars nor the Star Trek franchises have been able to make in years...,9,5 October 2005,"The big question when it comes to a film with such a cult following is if it's a fans-only film, or if it plays well to people unfamiliar with its Firefly past. To that, my answer can only be... damned if I know. I'm a fan. I know the Firefly history. Heck, I even knew the story between the last episode and the movie as told in the Serenity comic book. So if you're unfamiliar but are interested in seeing the movie, I really can't tell you if you'll follow it or not. But there are other reviews out there by unfamiliar parties that seem to suggest that you can.What I can tell you is that Serenity is an action-packed, involving, fun, tense, and funny thrill ride that is the sci-fi movie that neither the Star Wars nor the Star Trek franchises have been able to make in years. You may have needed to see Firefly to completely understand the film, and to completely appreciate it, but you don't need to be a former fan to enjoy this movie. You don't need to be a Joss Whedon fan either. You need to be a space sci-fi fan, or looking for an action adventure flick. If you enjoy space movies, then I can't see how you wouldn't be entertained by this flick (unless you're really particular about special effects quality. With a budget of only $40 million, the film looks a little clunky at times, which for fans, only makes it feel more authentic and personal). In short, this is the best future/sci-fi/space movie at least since 1997's The Fifth Element. It's a refreshing take on the genre, with it's space western motif, that delivers the thrills and themes one has come to expect from the genre.At the heart of the film is Nathan Fillion's Captain Malcolm Reynolds, who exhibits the roguish charms that Han Solo used to have before George Lucas digitally altered things so Guido shoots first. When thinking about how much the Star Wars prequels all sucked, I realised that they focused on the wrong character and had wished they'd have shown a young Han Solo before he wound up in the Mos Eisley Cantina. Cause who wouldn't want to see Han flying around in the old Falcon, smuggling things and avoiding the Empire? If that sounds like a movie you'd like to see, then watch Serenity, and you'll be pleased.For fans, the movie is the culmination of the promise of those first 14 episodes, playing very much like the series finale it never got. There are fantastic fan moments, and many dangling plot threads from the series are resolved. The actors slip back into their characters pretty well, with only a few awkward fits in the translation to the big screen (personally, the relationship between Mal and Book didn't feel quite right to me. Also, Zoe and Wash don't get enough time to flesh out their relationship, mostly due to the breakneck pace of the film). The movie is a little glossier than the dust and dirt tendencies of the show, but makes up for it with the bigger scale that the silver screen allows. The movie gives a better sense of the size of the Serenity universe, and not having to deal with network broadcast standards allows the movie to show more of the brutality of the Reavers.A big worry I had as a fan going into the film is that it would repeat much of what I already knew to acclimatise new viewers. I understood the necessity of opening things up for new viewers, but at the same time, didn't want to sit through re-hashed stories. Whedon is able to find a happy middle ground here, giving the necessary exposition in the beginning of the film, while showing all new moments at the same time. The focus of the movie is the story of River Tam (Summer Glau) and why the Alliance has been in pursuit of her since the Firefly pilot when her brother Simon (Sean Maher) rescued her from the Alliance. Fans of the show knew the story of Simon rescuing River, but until now, had never actually seen him do it. So, the movie shows fans what we'd never seen before while at the same time explaining the story to new viewers. Perfect. It also helps that the expositionary opening half of the film is the best filmed portion of the movie.I thoroughly loved the movie, and was at the edge of my seat throughout. Once the film gets going, it doesn't stop going until the final moments. It's as tense and exciting a film as was this summer's War of the Worlds, only without the cop-out ending. My one complaint would be that as great as the film was, it would've been better as a five episode arch on the series. There are huge moments in the film that aren't given the time they deserve to truly observe the impact behind them (Whedon really packs the film full of story, so much so that the movie doesn't take any time for an opening credits sequence). Also, most of the characters besides Mal and River are under-featured, an unavoidable consequence of having such a large ensemble (still, I would've preferred a bit more funny out of Adam Baldwin's Jayne Cobb).Still, I'll see it many more times after this, and am begging for a sequel. Or, better yet, a new TV series (just not on FOX). If you're a fan of Firefly, then I can't imagine you'd be anything but pleased by the movie. If you've never seen the show, but are interested in the movie, I'd suggest you go ahead and watch Serenity now, and if you like it, go back and discover Firefly.",Serenity
324,Dukes_Sheep,Absolutely Great,9,16 October 2005,"I don't write too many reviews. Don't see the need and I don't like the technical aspects of reviews most people try and write. Who cares about discussions of lighting or sound or whether the director captured the essence of the work. I either like a movie or I don't.I had never watched FIREFLY. To be honest I don't even remember it ever being on which probably shows how little it was promoted although I must admit I watch very little television.When SERENITY came out I broke down and bought the DVD collection of of FIREFLY and watched. Then tried to figure out why this series was not still running and a huge hit. Probably the best SF series ever to run on television.Went and saw SERENITY last night. Again, its one of the best SF movies I have ever seen and I'd remove it from the genre and say its one of the best movies I have ever seen period.It has everything. Characters you care about, plot, good dialog and fast paced action. At one point my wife, who sat through SAVING PRIVATE RYAN with no problems got too involved with the development of one of the characters and had to leave the movie.My kids, 16 and 18, who had never seen a episode of FIREFLY loved it.Its going to be a shame when its totally ignored at the Academy Awards.A must see and a sure DVD purchase when released.",Serenity
325,Maggot-6,Lightweight popcorn for teens,4,15 September 2006,"Gees, gimme a break. A commercial venture clearly directed at the filmgoing demographic of teen daters and starving trekkers. At heart, the TV pathos is clear: Teen-Age Wish Fulfillment Entertainment. Wow, how very unique. At least there was no forensic ""science"" in the hour I tolerated. But this is not a place to enjoy stimulation, or new ideas unless you are a teen or someone still pondering the stuff that was tired to high school grads in 1950: ""God-Dog...like wow, I'm deep"". There are better ways to spend 2 hours, starting with sleep. Can they not even improve on the Millennium Falcon? Pretend that the crew would take it seriously when a they are at seriously peril of being spam-in-a-can heading for a catastrophic re-entry crash absent heat shields? How can you not be insulted that you are expected to except they'd all brashly joke about this en route?

326,Ata-2,More hype than hyper,3,8 October 2005,"In brief, just a lot of Hollywood and fan hype about a second-rate sci-fi flick.I am a Firefly fan and I looked forward to seeing this movie for about six months. Great SFX, witty dialogue, but mediocre script, lack-luster direction and whoever edited this movie should be the first against the wall when the revolution comes. Actually I got so bored when watching this movie that I kept fidgeting in my seat to keep the blood flowing. I wondered afterwards why I couldn't get into it. After all I am a big Firefly fan so they had to work hard to make *me* get bored.The first problem is definitely the script. It is clever with the dialogue, but it is simply not very interesting.The second problem is the editing. You get a feeling this was a longer movie thats been cut. I can just imagine what went on. OK we're over time so what shall we get rid of? Well we can't get rid of all the SFX and fighting scenes cause marketing will go nuts, so lets just drop the scenes to do with any kind of character development. What was great about Firefly was the affection between the characters. There is none of that in this movie. You actually have to care what happens to the characters to give a hoot if they live or die. Doh! I remember something Spielberg said about not being able to get away with too many surprises in a movie. I mean after the fifth or sixth time something ""surprising"" happens, you start expecting it and then you stop caring altogether.Finally, this movie is oh so predictable. Not on a scene by scene basis, but in general. Surely I was not the only one who figured out all the so called ""secrets"", and ending about one third of the way.Sadly Christina Hendricks who is the most beautiful woman who has ever walked the Earth was missing from this movie or I would have thought it worth the money.",Serenity
327,hawksburn,It was alright,5,12 October 2005,"Was I expecting more? Probably. Did I enjoy watching what I saw? Yeah,it had fun bits. Do I think it could've been better? Yes.I'm a fan of the TV series. I brought it on DVD when no one in Australia had even heard of it and when network TV finally did screen it here they buried it in the wee hours of the morning. However I'm not a Whedonite. I loved Angel but hated Buffy (ok, there were odd episodes of Buffy I did like, most notably the musical one; but generally it wasn't on my must-watch list the majority of the time) and the original Buffy movie? Puh-leeze, what a load of junk that was.I left a comment some time back about Firefly and how I absolutely loved that series (check it if you want) so my anticipation for this movie has been high all year. Like I said, I enjoyed it but not as much as I wanted to.It betrays its TV origins. It looks like an extended TV episode, not a motion picture. The production values & sfx are practically the same as that for the original show. I wanted some awe and grandeur that I realize the TV series could never have satisfied. Unfortunately the movie didn't either.It doesn't fit into the original series as perfectly as some people on here think. As far as I'm aware in the original show Simon and River brought passage on Serenity whilst it was in port getting supplies. So unless somewhere between episode 13 and the beginning of the film the Alliance has kidnapped River back, what exactly was the story with the military lab breakout? Unless that wasn't Serenity lowering the platform? Possible I guess.I was disappointed by the choice of character they chose to dispatch. OK, I know that 2 characters meet their demise during the course of the film but the loss of the second one just.....disappointed me. I thought, why kill them?!?! To me it was a loss of one of the most important characters in the Firefly universe, let alone one of the funniest & wittiest. To know that this character will 'probably' not take part in any future sequels (with only a US$10mill take on its opening weekend, that is looking very unlikely) means that they will be the lesser for it (I say 'probably' because who's to say they don't find a magical way to resurrect this person later).. I believe the writers erred in getting rid of such a focal personality so quickly when surely it would have been better to develop that character to increase the emotional investment in their loss in a subsequent sequel. But I digress, I'm not a scriptwriter.The standout character? Not even one of the crew. The Operative. His rationality and calmness was frightening. The man exuded civilised barbarity. Yet at the end he even he is somewhat redeemed. At one point I thought he might even hop aboard Serenity. Unlikely I know, but in a crew of vagabonds & thieves of questionable morality and pasts, he actually fits in a way.One question: If this is set 5 hundred years into the future, where is Earth in all this. The opening prologue suggests they were colonists sent from an overpopulated Earth to a new solar system. Have they travelled so far from home that they are no longer in contact with it? Has a society developed so independently that they no longer have any need or regard for the homeworld or have even forgotten it? Given that it must have taken them at least 2 centuries or more to establish their current levels of technology and civilisation (especially on the core worlds) would it not be a probability that some interstellar communication with (a probably more technologically superior) Earth would be occurring? Or is Earth dead? The limits of travel in this world seems to be restricted to within the boundaries of the (very large, dozens of worlds are mentioned) solar system, not interstellar.In all I enjoyed the jokey script, I enjoyed seeing the characters again. I even enjoyed the story. I just thought it lacked the punch and bravado to make it a killer film.P.S I still have a crush on Kaylee.",Serenity
328,nujuv,SPOILERS so close- soooooooooooo close,6,7 October 2005,"SPOILERS I'LL BE BRIEFish - the recap and track around the inside of the ship (the exterior shot with cap'n on the deck with Wash seen through the 'windscreen' as fire burned around the ship on entry was effin inspired) set the tone brilliantly and held a huge pair of fingers up to anyone who thought Firefly was just a fanboy/girls rant of the hour.The reaver thing was pretty groovy Jane should be made president BUT the final answers to what River is and what dodgy sh*& Book was up to really didn't work for me.Also, some of fight sequences (River related) seemed to be way too (BUFFY!!! - Underworld - MAtrix) familiar - which sucks when you consider Janes unorthodox fighting style and non standard fight/threat outcomes from the series and odd bits of this very movie.I deduct four marks for clichés and sucky realisation of a pretty groovy plot line.For the record, this film still piddles all over the last three Star Wars movies (even the short lived reaver attack was well on par with George ""what have I become - what have I become"" Lucaseseses capital ship cgi stuff)-it just didn't live fully up to the out of the blue fabness of the series.

329,groatski,"A good movie but, c'mon, #146 of the top 250?",7,18 October 2005,"As of this writing Serenity is sandwiched between 'Platoon' and 'The African Queen' on IMDb's top 250, and I'm sorry, but this movie is not of the caliber of either one of those. It was very watchable, with some real heart-pounding action sequences and more than a passing nod to character development, but it had Hollywood stamped all over it. C'mon, a bunch of gritty outlaw space renegades that look like Sears underwear models in form-fitting outfits and $200 hairdos? I couldn't help but notice within the first 10 minutes that the boy/girl ratio was such that there was bound to be some romantic dramas played out, and I wasn't disappointed. There were, in fact, several. These people are supposed to be desperate outlaws, constantly living on the edge one step ahead of the law. Hardly a place for lovers quarrels.The storyline was competent and intriguing, but there were many gaps (I won't get into details for fear of spoiling the plot). Watching movies of this type require a suspension of reality, but when the lead hero takes two bullets and a knife wound and still manages to beat the bad guy (and walk away unscathed), it goes just a bit far. Sylvester Stallone and Jean-Claude Van Damme would have been right at home in the last scenes.I'm not trying to sound like a sanctimonious poop-head here. I was certainly entertained by this movie and would recommend it to anyone wanting a good sci-fi action thriller, but let's put it in proper perspective. There are good movies, very good movies, and great movies. This was a good movie.",Serenity

331,Sevenmercury7,Great series loses charm on the big screen,8,22 November 2006,"I saw 'Serenity' before 'Firefly' and thought it was very good; solid effects, punchy script, full of action. After going back to the series, however, I was taken aback by the quality of the show. The edgy humour, anti-hero characters and general throwaway delivery were fantastic. It was great knockabout fun with a few serious themes here and there. The western element was a stroke of genius. I bought it immediately.Back to the movie then. It's not in the same league, frankly. Sure, the one-liners are there, the characters all have something to contribute, the budget is increased; all the elements are in place, but.... it's like the show inverted. Despite the odd wisecrack, 'Serenity' takes itself VERY seriously. Those underlying themes of the series (faith, sacrifice, the greater good) here take centre stage, and at times the film goes far darker than anything in the TV show. By the end (second time round), I was satisfied but underwhelmed. The spark of the series had been replaced with a dour, rather grim tone.Action fans will love it. Rabid fans of the series will rejoice seeing their heroes again. I'd much rather see a return to the charm of 'Firefly'.",Serenity
332,foffster,Totally in love,10,20 January 2007,"Oh my god how I love this movie and the series ""Firefly""! It's ridiculous! As any person who have seen the series will tell you, it's hard to believe it was cancelled so early on. So, Joss Whedon made this movie to sum it all up, and it's the perfect good bye. Possibly one of the best sci-fi movies ever made, it mixes all of the humour, story lines and terrific cast from the series and tops it off with great effects and depth.It's sad, that's what it is. How something as good as this can get cancelled. This movie should have been a bonus from the series, and then it should have gone on for years and years and years. If Stargate SG-1 can make it (also a series I love), then Firefly should have made it.Still, this movie can be seen without knowing anything about the series (I didn't when I first saw it), and it will drag you in like a puppy grabbed by a tiger.If I ever would recommend a sci-fi movie, it would be Serenity. 10/10",Serenity
333,Rick_Terminal,"I was not expecting something this good, frankly!",9,18 October 2005,"Okay, I have a unique perspective on this film and it's origin, and I'm glad I have. I saw the original Firefly series (well, some of them) - and was pretty gutted to see it didn't last that long.That was a long time ago, and I honestly cannot remember anything about the series, or why I liked it! All I remember was thinking it was like a good western set in space instead of the American frontier.So, last night, after learning Serenity was a sci-fi (which also surprised me - given the name - I thought it would be a flick for Alcoholics Anonymous or something), I decided what the hell - I would use my last tenner to go see this.What a shock! It was superb! The characters are brilliantly developed throughout (especially the Captain and his 'nemesis'), and the plot is imaginative, feasible, and disturbing. The Reevers genuinely curdled my blood - especially when they do 'they're thing'.I would like to make special mention of when the two large fleets crash in to each other. Part of me wanted to see a bigger view of what was happening, but the director kept focus on Serenity - it actually pays off so many times in this film, because areas of typical Hollywood bravado are downplayed making certain consequences of events mean so much more. At the start of the clash between the Feds and the Reevers, there was this wonderful look of horror on the face of our 'evil guy' - and for the only moment in the film he lost his cool. Brilliant! It surprised me that so many important characters were killed off. This works, because it makes you believe, and care about what happens. To me, it suggests that the writer has enough faith in himself to write more full-rounded characters. Will there be a 'Serenity' mini-series? I hope so, as the foundation has been well laid.I don't want to spoil anything, but the revelations are quite astonishing - and again feasible. It really is showing what can happen when a government demands too much control.I hope people will judge this as stand alone - it deserves respect, and for me has changed my outlook on science fiction. This is because there is no 'unbelievable' science, and the future looks dangerous, gritty and grim. Somehow, I feel this is closer to what human kind will be like one day. Sad but true! So, recommendations all round from me. Please let me know what you thought!",Serenity
334,kidboi,"Not the best sci-fi flick, but pretty entertaining.",5,10 December 2005,"The film had it's up's and down's. The things that i really didn't like about the film where - Adam Baldwin, stupid, not funny jokes and the space ship ""Serenity"" it self(it really looked like a dog!!). But there where also things that where quite enjoyable in the movie, like the violin music, which could have been a lot more. Or the special effects. But the film, at some of it's points, just doesn't cut it to Star Wars. the fighting scenes, are just too much like Buffy, The Vampire Slayer. The film isn't mesmerizing, it doesn't bring anything original. I'd say it's just a typical action sci-fi, with not much thought. The reevers are too much like zombies from the already mentioned Buffy. But if you want to relax, enjoy good special effects, then this is the movie for you.",Serenity

It also shows that not every idea about resurrecting a TV show (and on top of that, a canceled TV show) is a clever idea. They should have just saved the movie for the SciFi Channel or a DVD premiere where it belongs with its limited production values and limited acting (save for Chiwetel Ejiofor, the classy actor from DIRTY PRETTY THINGS, and Summer Grau, she did manage to bring enigma to her physical role). Was I the only one that saw how this movie did not manage to bring anything new and exciting to the Science Fiction genre? At least George Lucas's movies entertained, even if they lack originality and heart.What else can you say about a movie that not even its alleged fans are supporting in its theater run?",Serenity
336,fatmaninatrenchcoat,I love this flick,10,9 October 2006,"There has been a noticeable lack in quality Sci-fi in the last 5 to 10 years. There have been a few entries, but for my money The original Matrix and Serenity are the only ones to write home about ( I may be forgetting something, who knows). When this film was first released I had a vague memory of ""Firefly"", and knew that everything else Joss Wheadon had done I really hated (Still do). But the ""Firefly"", Serenity saga is exactly what sci-fi should be. I takes place in a well designed universe so far in the future there will never be any danger of proving it wrong. A truly classic Anti hero in Mal Reynolds (the perfect Nathan Fillion), and with the operative, a truly menacing villain, much better than anything the new Star War trilogy produced. Add some great Han Solo-esquire one liners and truly phenomenal effects, Serenity is not to be missed if you are a Sci-Fi fan.

337,cnitinb,Masterstroke in the world of 'Firefly' and even in the whole sci-fi genre,9,17 February 2012,"Serenity is a fitting finale to the TV series ""Firefly"". Although it is not mandatory to have seen the series to 'understand' this movie, it is to completely 'experience' and enjoy it. A former rebel against the 'Alliance'(Government) and now the captain of a spaceship called 'serenity', Malcolm Reynolds(Fillon)and his crew mates embark on a journey to uncover a secret concerning why the corrupt Government tortured one of the crew mate 'River Tam'. This is only the briefest possible synopsis that one can make of his complex saga. Anyone who has seen any series understands how difficult and unfair it is to reveal any plot. The backbone of this film lies in the unfairly and prematurely aborted series -'Firefly'. The series builds up a neat relatable history and makes the characterizations more deep. The Protagonist is Captain 'Mal' Reynolds the strict but quirky Captain with a Golden heart, his faithful war companion Zoe, her husband the pilot 'Wash',a beautiful Escort 'Inara', a homely girl- next-door mechanic 'Kaylee', a friendly mercenary 'Jayne' and a mysterious god man 'Shepard Book'. It even has a typical soap-opera-like 'dreamy+Genius' doctor-'Simon' and his messed up sister, the tortured crew mate in question-'River'. The characters are a perfect mix to entertain and provide a lot of potential for their growth as well as that of the plot. And the talent that he is, Director Joss whedon doesn't waste any of this potential and spins a fine yarn , right from the pilot episode of 'Firefly' to this nail biting , unforgettable finale. The only nit picking one can do to find fault is that the visual effects aren't top notch.But the silver lining is that the effect as are far better than that in the series and comes off in a positive light therefore.In conclusion, Firefly is a sci-fi masterpiece that is a perfect blend of action, adventure, romance and space drama that sadly got cut off before it could reach its full potential but was resurrected as 'serenity' the film, the final masterstroke that would make sure no one would forget to mention it along the likes of star wars and star trek.",Serenity
338,marc242,Does not justify the hype....sorry.,4,25 March 2006,"I've seen this movie on DVD a couple of days ago,and sorry... it just does not justify the hype on the net and elsewhere. It looks and feels like a decent TV-standard Episode thrown onto the big screen. The actors are likable (I have not seen the TV-Series,btw) but hopelessly mediocre. I was reminded of early-80s B-Movie SciFi Productions like ICE PIRATES or BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS. Entertaining and endearing for its silliness, but by no means a work of art or even Oscar-worthy. I really wonder why there was such an extreme Geek-Out for this series and the Motion Picture. Its really not THAT good. Its old-fashioned space-opera fare, infused with some strong Western Vibes and some glimpses of weird ideas (USA fuses with China in the Future ??). The Reavers and their secret origin were a nice idea, but they looked totally out of place in this movie. They belong in a cheap Italian MAD MAX-Ripoff, not in a SciFi-Adventure. Plus, they looked rather silly, and weren't shown much. Were the makeup-appliances really that bad ? Anyway,not bad for a B-Movie, but a major motion picture needs than some derivative ideas and ""enthusiastic-for-no-reason"" fans.Bye...",Serenity
339,plotlessviolence,Flawless,10,28 January 2006,"I saw this movie without ever having seen the show Firefly, and hesitantly because I normally don't like Sci Fi. There hasn't been good science fiction cinema since Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. But MAN was this a good movie. It hooks you from the beginning, fires on all cylinders, and moved me to see it three times before it was out of theatres.I've now seen the show Firefly, and it turns out that was one of the most brilliant shows ever made (and I say that being physically unable to tolerate the stupidity that is Joss Whedon's other work, Buffy the idiot slayer). In general, it's better to see the show before the movie (in the intended order, not Fox's attempt-to-kill-the-franchise-choice of order) simply because you get to know the characters and the movie opens by spoiling some of River's abilities. However, you may want to see the film first in order to decide whether you want to see the show, and you'll still enjoy both immensely. The characters are all introduced brilliantly enough in the movie so that you don't need any inside (show) information, and frankly the movie is better than the series (although I have two friends whom I made fans of the franchise who disagree).ACTION For an American movie, there's a lot of good fighting here. The relevant crew members show off their military training in the shooting sequences, thug Jayne has a wreslter's move, River busts out with beautiful, flowing circular Wu shu when her abilities are ""awakened,"" Mal the leader uses dirty streetfighting befitting of his character, and the sophisticated bad guy The Operative has his own combination of specialized trained martial arts, swordfighting, and his special paralysis-inducing strike.There are two main fights, and they're both good. They won't put the 1970s Shaw Brothers/Jackie Chan kung fu movies (or the modern Tony Jaa Thai movies) to shame, but they kick the pants out of, say, Batman Begins'.The graphical effects look really good...the only thing you can tell was greenscreened is that first Reaver ship that chases them on the first planet. But given the shoestring $38 million budget, everything looks good without exaggerating: Serenity is about the characters and plot, not the sci-fi. And the music is GORGEOUS. I had to get the soundtrack by David Newman; his violin-guitar music perfectly fits the Space Western theme. The other thing is that Whedon is great cinematographer; his screen framing is great, and he continues the steadicam motif from Firefly here. Check out the 4.5-minute unbroken sequence 9 minutes into the movie where he introduces the crew characters. By not cutting every half second like other, more epileptic-inducing directors and following characters around and zooming, the movie really draws you in.COMEDY Joss Whedon is a master of dialogue, and while there are some dark, sad, gravitas moments, there are also some great jokes and witty moments and you have to see Serenity repeatedly to catch all of them.PLOT It's hard to go into details because most of what I could say would spoil the movie, but I will say that the plot is really good, and you don't get a lot of movies these days with a real story to tell. The main characters are the smuggler captain Mal who fought on the losing side of a unification war, his albatross crazy passenger River, and the evil pursuer The Operative. The most fascinating one is the newcomer The Operative, who embodies a wholly unique kind of evil from any other you've seen in theatres before. Despite a limited 2 hour run, Whedon is able to get each character to have his or her own shiny moments, and he's not afraid to sacrifice any of them to keep you involved when the story demands.Ultimately, Serenity is one of the 3 best movies I have ever seen, the kind of flawless works that no one wants to see, but everyone who sees loves.",Serenity
340,Ziman,Whedon's labour of love turns into a solid story and must-see film.,9,3 October 2005,"Malcolm Reynolds, once a rebel on the losing end of a planetary civil war, is now an outlaw. He's an outlaw in the old-west sense of the word as he earns his living smuggling contraband, performing small crimes, and offering transport within the solar system. Serenity's crew is an eclectic mix of personalities, from one of ""Mal's"" old war companions, to a hardened outlaw and gun fanatic, and a pair of fugitives hiding from the government.The ""business"" of the ship Serenity keeps Mal and his crew running from the law (the Alliance) which keeps them in the outer rim planets for the most part. However a different sort of threat lurks in that territory Reavers. Reavers are an unstoppable race of insane savages who wreak sheer barbaric wrath upon anyone they meet.Malcom and his crew might be outlaws, and may in fact be criminal, running from a threat from both sides that doesn't mean they don't have souls and don't know what is right for humanity. They aren't wicked and evil they're just a band of merry thieves making a living.There... I just summed up the premise for the television series Firefly and for this follow-up film, Serenity. For those of you who watched the series, sorry this isn't new information for you. And for those who haven't and figured I just spoiled things, rest assured I haven't. You need to know this, and the film is quick to fill you in on that information in its first few minutes.As I mentioned Serenity is a follow-up film to Joss Whedon's series, Firefly. Whedon is responsible for the writing of a number of films and television projects. Although with no discredit intended toward his other works, Serenity is by far his most creative, most unique, and is cleverly written.Whedon has said in many interviews in light of his other successes that Firefly remains his true passion. While writing and filming even the first (and only) season of the series, Whedon says that the cast and crew formed a tight bond very quickly. They quickly became family... something that usually begets long-lived productions. It is that bond that really came through on the small screen, and subsequently now on the big-screen. Whedon swore not to let this franchise die it's crib death and that it would go on. And go on it has. Serenity is truly a labour of love for Whedon and it definitely shows on screen.The characters Whedon has created are done so with great care and detail. From the crew of Serenity, to the Alliance Operative who is chasing after them, they are all written and directed extremely well by Whedon. They behave exactly as one would expect they should on screen at all times and never do anything that comes off as uncharacteristic.The story is as rock solid as the characters. We know where it takes place, and we know who's involved and we learn why. You never have to ask why someone is doing this or that or what's going on. On the same token, you don't know what's coming next. The setup at the beginning may be quick, but it has to be so we get the actual story going properly. The fact that Serenity is a follow up to a TV series does not hurt it in the least as a standalone film and does not make Firefly a pre-requisite. In fact, because of the series, Serenity's story could have potentially been a lot more complicated, but again, Whedon's writing and sensibility allowed him to tell a proper story in the time allotted and to tell the story he wanted us to see.The action is fast paced and has that kind of roller coaster feel to it. At times such moments will often throw you a punch you weren't expecting. Whedon's quick wit style of comedy comes through a good part of the dialogue and there is also a dramatic component that really brings the story to light.There are definitely certain influences behind Serenity that come out of similar not-so-perfect-future works we've seen before. There's even a bit of spaghetti western feel to it as well and some martial arts sequences that Whedon seems to like. But influences should be just that and nothing more. Sometimes writers can let their influences become re-done works or clichés. However Whedon still has full control of his own work here, and he does so very well with his own imagination that it makes Serenity a completely unique product of his own creativity.Serenity does not fail to entertain at any level. It's not overly dramatic, and certainly not over-the-top as to be silly. A few lines are a bit quirky, but that's just Whedon's style and it's done for comic relief. Serenity is a perfect blend of what makes movies strong and what science fiction has been lacking for a long time.Serenity gets a 9/10 and a my 'must-see' recommendation.",Serenity

342,jim-j-moore,Watchable but somewhat stale formula,6,9 April 2006,"It was 9pm and I thought I would watch Serenity prior to winking out for the night. Having poured myself a very tall drink I was somewhat disappointed to find that this movie was fairly mediocre. I was faced with a quandary; quaff the beverage, bin the flick and go to bed or keep on sipping and tough it out. Realising that I can't really comment without seeing it through and that downing a large martini of those proportions in one hit isn't really on, I chose the latter.This movie actually wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't such a tired formula. I won't give the plot away but then it's so predictable I don't really need to...just consider the ingredients; a rag-tag band of ""outlaw"" stereotypes led by the ""lovable rogue"" captain, a ruthless and relentless establishment ""bad guy"" in pursuit and a mysterious girl with an innocent and eccentric facade that belies ""hidden powers"" within. The plot and character combination would make it a challenge for any actor to perform well, so it will come as no surprise that the acting was fairly stolid...not helped by what appeared to be attempts to inject some humour with a little hamming it up that, sadly, failed to hit the mark. Reasonable but antiseptically artificial special effects rounded off an overall bland movie experience.Update: the film improves with a second viewing and, on giving it another go, I found it easier to look beyond the deficiencies and enjoyed it more.",Serenity
343,beetleborgs69,Hope for the human race,10,15 June 2015,"Humanistic propaganda... that would be an objective assessment of this movie.

Well, there you have the state of ""Serenity"", a PG-13 ultra-violent family-friendly underrated Hollywood blockbuster that wins me over from head to toe. A world of paradoxes here, my friend.The miraculous conclusion to a show that was underhandedly D.O.A., it's hard not to be won over by the wish fulfillment, and the vicarious thrill of the action. The stereotypical message of ""love will keep is afloat in the aether"" rings so true upon allowance it makes up for a century of Hollywood's emotional manipulation. Anti-corporation, anti-government, verging on misanthropic while still being entirely forgiving of it's human characters, on all sides and fronts... judging this movie as a stand-alone blockbuster... I just can't merit it enough. Joss Whedon has never proved himself like he has here. This is THE work of Joss Whedon... he has been hired on as a helping hand on various projects, taken lead on others to help guide the way through the muck, but here we have a total work of his kind, the likes of which I don't expect to ever see again.The state of the world... apocalypse. Humanity is dead or dying. The few survivors riding the cusp of the wave of destruction fend for themselves with moral ambiguity... tasked with achieving unprecedented righteousness or falling to the center of the great cataclysm. And what is the cataclysm? Why, that is humanity itself, wading in the ocean, making ripples. The loneliness... a science-fiction future with no omnipresence, aliens, benevolent technology, only humans, echoing faintly through time, propagating themselves desperately and disparately with no help and no guidance beyond passion, love. As a casual fan of the show since 2005, upon the movie's initial release (completely unaware of the original ""airing""), I have come back to this show and this film twice, each time with a skeptical eye, seeing the ploy of the play to win over the vast audience, but somehow being won over by the whole raggedy feel of the thing over again... humanity is torn to shreds in this universe as in few fictions I've ever seen. The closest approximation I can actually give for the situation would be present day reality, and the sad and sorry state we humans find ourselves in today.In every character is a facet of the conscious individual's eye on society. Subliminal messages haunt the home, random violence infiltrates the psyche, paranoid hatred tears families and lovers apart while the laws of physics bring them back to reality, staring each other in the eye with futile tears for the degeneration of their own species. All the while the voices of the dead and the damned, of past, present, and future, chatter on like a wall of illusion in the hive-mind, daring the individual to succumb to the noise. Has fate really brought us such a disastrous result? Are we really to die at the hands of the empty void, no love in our hearts to guide us past this false illusory control of our senses? If Hollywood had an easy answer for us, then it would surpass images on the screens and violent vibrations blasting out of our state-of-the-art sound systems... so long as the lonely child is forced to wile away his days looking for himself in the commercial arts of humanity, this is a screen play with insurmountable merit.",Serenity
344,thescribe7,Spot on Sci-Fi,8,19 April 2015,"If you go into this without having seen Firefly, the show this acts as a sequel to, you can follow it. You'll be a bit lost with the characters. But I think this is something Joss Whedon got right. In his work on the Avengers I always felt the characters didn't do enough together. As in relating. This is a similar situation. Avengers needed five films to build up to it and Serenity had to build upon a cancelled TV show. Where this excels where Avengers doesn't is in character moments. This has all the dark parts needed to tell a story but we have fun watching because the characters are witty. We get a sense of who each of them are just by the first opening scenes of them together. It's obvious as to what kind of people they are whereas Avengers kinda just gives us the witty dialogue part. Avengers doesn't give us defining character moments like this does with Malcolm. In one scene do we get the idea of what Malcolm and the preacher's relationship is. Just by the beginning do we get a sense of River's position.You can follow this without the show but it might be confusing. As in a ""what's happening and why are they doing this?"" kind of way. Nevertheless it doesn't hurt the film much because you really do get a sense of who these kind of people are and that's what makes it.",Serenity
345,kameleontti,Takes your breath away,9,22 February 2008,"I read a plot summary before seeing this movie and I had my doubts of how it would work out. It sounded like the deaths of Wash and Book were unnecessary, but when I saw the movie, I was relieved to notice that it had been carried out well and they did have a meaning.When watching Firefly, I often considered Wash a ""lesser"" character, rather annoying with his jokes, but mostly they were on Jayne and Jayne somewhat deserves to be picked on. Wash carried out his duty, bringing the ship down safely when it was uncertain if they would make it. Also his death marks a sort of a point of no return: even if the ship was in flying condition, the others might not be skilled enough to fly it out of there. Also on the DVD comment track it was said that his sudden death made the whole movie theater burst in laughter. One of the good things about Joss Whedon's productions is that he can make serious things funny (like the torture scene in Firefly). I feel sad for Zoë, though  she wanted to have a baby with Wash and unless he donated to a sperm bank in the past, that dream is now never going to come true. The dialog in the end where it sounds like they're talking about Serenity, it's in fact about Zoë and that's very touching. I wish she would find a moment for mourning and somebody to comfort her.It's unfortunately impossible to have a movie with 9 main characters, even more if counting the Operative and Mr. Universe, so some of the primary characters from Firefly (mainly Inara) had to stay in the shadows to give room for plot advancement. There simply wasn't enough room for all the things that were considered important in Firefly. They couldn't use Inara's status as a Companion to their advantage because they seemed to be chased by the whole Alliance so diplomatics wouldn't have helped. Also there wasn't much room for romance due to the exhausting pace of the film, but at least Kaylee and Simon got each other in the end (I laughed at River spying on them from the ceiling!) and it is hinted that Inara might also stay.There was quite a lot of combat and I'm not sure if it was quite necessary, but it was tolerable. I'm glad they didn't show River fighting the Reavers because that would've spoiled a lot. You could imagine that she sacrificed herself, and when the door opens for a moment you wonder if it's the Reavers coming (how did she manage to open the door anyway, didn't Kaylee rig it so that once it is closed, it cannot be opened anymore?) but then we see River standing there and before we can even sigh with relief, the wall behind her crashes to reveal the Alliance soldiers. That's just a priceless moment. I don't care how she did it; I'm ready to believe she's a superhero. Mal fighting the Operative took a bit too long but it ended well.I don't think that Mal threatened to kill any of his crew; he just said that it's the end of the line for anyone who doesn't want to come along to Reaver territory. Staying behind in a slaughtered town doesn't seem like a very nice option but you could still survive. The Reaver territories must be too wide for circumventing and it seemed like there was no time to waste. It wouldn't be much of a movie if it featured the heroes taking weeks or months to sail through empty space to get somewhere.I'm not sure how Mal knew the Alliance was waiting behind the ion cloud but a lot of the movie is about intuition. He could've gotten away without alarming the Reavers if he had wanted to, but he shot one of their ships just to catch their attention and have them chasing him to provide a distraction. It's another priceless moment when the ships emerge from the clouds because you would realize what's going to happen right before it happens so you could laugh at the Alliance for thinking Serenity was all alone and vulnerable.I didn't like the character Mr Universe. He's more like someone from The Matrix or like Eyes Only from Dark Angel; not someone space cowboys would befriend. It was clear that they needed some way for the Miranda information to be broadcast but I just started thinking, wouldn't it have been way cooler if they had infiltrated a major Alliance TV station and sent the message from there? But then we might not have the big fight between the Reavers and the Alliance, and it would be a totally different movie.",Serenity
346,lngjon,Hack.,1,5 October 2006,"Must be hot with the under 15 crowd and 30 year old geeks living with their mothers to have this score. The writing it this was so hackworthy that I couldn't stand more than about 15 minutes of it. The screenplay read like something written by a pimply 14 year old for drama class after binging on red bull and powdered donuts. This would be great B-movie fare if it had Bruce Campbell in it, but without him if falls flat on its face, a fall enhanced by its attempts to take itself seriously. Bad acting, worse writing, do not an 8.2 make, although the black chick was pretty hot. This thing makes me wonder how the ever-so cheesy Joss Whedon keeps getting work.",Serenity
347,mr_me,Wow Wow Wow,10,21 April 2006,"I first heard about Serenity before I had even watched Firefly, so when I heard they were making a movie on a short lived sci-fi series, I automatically thought the worse. But, after doing my homework and looking into Firefly a little more, and watching the series, I realized how wrong I was. I did have some worries, however, as TV to big screen transitions are frequently bad.Serenity blew me away. I love Firefly, but I wouldn't consider myself a Firefly freak, however this movie nearly made me cry. It worked so well and has been the best sci-fi viewing in years, with many lackluster films and TV shows appearing, for example, the disappointing new Star Wars trilogy, more Star Treks than I can handle, not to mention their movies! Although I do particularly like First Contact, but I'm here to talk about Serenity, not Star Trek.Anyway, back to Serenity, just plain great. All of the characters are reintroduced in a manner that allows first time viewers to enjoy it without getting lost. The script has attempted to give all these characters a little time to there selves, so that they are not pushed into the background and forgotten about. The script is amazing and original, very well directed, and full of action, character development, and a nice way to round off the TV show, which was cancelled before it was even given a chance.Its a shame Serenity didn't do very well in the box office, and has been denied a sequel. It is unbelievable that we are forced to suffer the like of Big Momma's House 2 and countless other bland, drab and horrible sequels, when a truly great movie, that is just begging for one, is denied it.Please, network execs, anyone in the movie business, give us Firefly on our screens again, or Serenity 2 (don't use that title). Don't let this be the last of what has truly been a great ride from start to finish.",Serenity
348,mewmewmint-1,You people... are... INSANE!!!,1,11 April 2006,"This movie SUCKED!! The dialog was only half as dorky as ""Dungeons and Dragons"", the dorkiest movie of all time. Therefore I give it 1/10. ""I am a leaf on the wind."" ""She always loved to dance..."" (when talking about something completely unrelated.) The dialog has got to be the absolute worst part about this movie. The second worst thing is that the story is completely uninteresting. The action scenes are third-rate at best. The acting, probably 9th rate, but it's hard to be a good thespian with material this bad. People may say the CGI was good, but there was only one short scene of that which I could remember, and it was not nearly on the same level as some of the movies today.I love sci-fi. I've read many books in this genre, it is my favorite. I didn't know that this was based on a TV series as I don't watch much TV. If I didn't just learn that I would have sworn it was based on an extremely crappy sci-fi novel. Didn't Joss Whedon also write dialog for Buffy the Vampire Slayer? Now that remark about, ""I haven't had anything between my nether regions that didn't have batteries for a year"" (paraphrased because I can't remember it perfectly) comment makes sense. It is reminiscent of the embarrassingly sophomoric sputum Willow used to spew every two minutes.8 out of 10?! For this hunk of crap?! Has the world gone mad?! One thing I don't get is how other movies in the same genre which are far far superior to this one seem to get crappy reviews. River has to be the most boring psychic ever, and maybe one of the most boring characters ever as well. She couldn't be more boring if this entire movie was about hiding in the basement and eating cheese.All of the characters suck in their own way, it was like this was written by a twelve year old.The captain: macho doofus. The pilot: ultra dork. The pilot's wife: super can't act woman. Horny grubby mechanic. And emotionless alien man, who pretends to have feelings. As well as a host of mystical pseudo-wisdom spewers, to give it that extra ""ooh i'm being enlightened without actually having to think about anything"" feeling.The assassin was probably the only semi-interesting character. At least until the story unraveled.",Serenity
349,dltdvd,Brilliant...,10,1 October 2005,"""Serenity"" is the kind of movie that, if the Oscar voters weren't made up of old stick-in-the-muds, would be in league with films like ""Citizen Kane"" and ""The Godfather.""Here is an example of how you can make a fine, epic-quality space opera on a relatively meager budget and end up with a product that is quite possibly better than the original ""Star Wars."" And while the film doesn't emphasize the science so much (as ""Star Trek"" does), the political satire combined with outstanding, albeit mostly no-name, actors and impressive special effects make ""Serenity"" a real, proper summer popcorn flick stuck in the beginning of fall where the year's most forgettable films are piled up.Here is a movie that stretches the imagination and makes the viewers go home and feel like writing screenplays of their own. This is a clever, creative, and thoughtful film that lets you drool over its breathtaking visuals and dazzling space battles but at the same time, leaves a lasting impression in the mind.While many of the viewers of the film have never heard of the show ""Firefly,"" upon which ""Serenity"" is based, I was lucky enough to watch the show on DVD and was amazed by the inventiveness. So naturally, I had to see the movie. Sadly, though, ""Serenity"" may not be easy to understand for some people unfamiliar with ""Firefly,"" but thankfully, I'm not one of those people.""Serenity"" is possibly the best movie of the summer (even though its technically a fall movie), and I am desperately eager to see a sequel, as this film was clearly open for one.",Serenity
350,lisawea,you'll like it better if you haven't seen the series!,4,26 September 2007,"""it would be better if it stood alone"". I found myself thinking that as I watched this in the theater. This is not so much a sequel as a rendition or alternate sequence of events.the movie starts at almost the same place as the series: with the crew in dire straights and everything hinging on one job which doesn't go so well. The main difference here is that this time Simon does the punching, which is kid of neat. Though the explanation the river's craziness (or rather how it was stopped) seems reasonable, it's just that some parts of this movie seem to go a bit to far against the series. speaking of which is what happened to Ariel? In 1xo9 Ariel Mal stated flat out ""they're part of my crew. no one's getting left"" what happened to that? this really feels more like an alternate version than a continuation.To judge it on its own merits, and bear with me here: they have the same witty dialog, the same good characters (for the most part) and good action sequences that made the series great. they have a decent plot and satisfactory explanations for it all. there are plenty of obstacles and obstructions for the crew to overcome which is always nice. the Rever bits near the end... oh never mind. the scenes with Inara and the operative are still the low points for me. out of 5 i give it 2.4 out of 10 I give it 5.",Serenity
351,kallepister,Seminal maverick,10,19 May 2009,"Renting this DVD just for a watch, i was immediately and completely taken by surprise. From the opening to the credits, this one amazed me like no other sci-fi movie in the last few years. I wondered why there hasn't been something like that before - that's a characteristic trait of a classic to me, by the way. Pity i rented it just to get over a hard days night, without former recommendation. Being a sci-fi fan, i bought the DVD of the movie AND the series, just to watch it all one day in a more bona fide way. This new-millennium classic deserves some Sunday afternoon Dolby 5.1 beamer setup and chips.To the critics: Don't teach the starving about condiments, dudes! Expecting nothing but moving pictures, i went watching STAR WARS back in 1977, with lowest expectations on such a braggy title. I left the hall in sheer astonishment. SERENITY is quite the opposite of a braggin' name, and i don't compare it with this frontier breaking milestone, but being drip-fed on sub-mediocre stuff for almost two decades, it simply satisfied my maliciously neglected needs for proper sci-fi.And I never spotted that much IMDb content in the ""Characters"" department... Ain't that a proof for loving fan care, gorram it?First of all, the faces: Chiwetel Ejiofor depicts the blind follower of an intergalactic scam so faithfully that it gave me the creeps, Nathan Fillion is the one and only rogue space ship captain around, Summer Glau makes a perfect weapon-in-disguise, Alan Tudyk renders Checkov dreary, and hey!, who needs a Wookie when lovely Jewel Staite maintains the engine? Second in my rating: The script plays with the genre specific stereotypes and standards in such a self-reliant, beautiful and funny way even DEMOLITION MAN can't dream of. The mere ease it juxtaposes the two inherently conflicting genres of sci-fi and wild-west is simultaneously path-breaking and breathtaking, and it reminds me somehow of the promising Han Solo theme in the first STAR WARS episode. Yet, instead of zeroing in on the better parts, Lucas turned STAR WARS into a sort of spaced-out Muppet Show - without Statler and Waldorf - just to be on the frigging safe side of the Box Office. There hasn't been a spin-off of the Millennium Falcon thang, however, so let's give SERENITY an exceedingly warm welcome. Third big Brownie point: The heartwarming soundtrack! SERENITY is THE contemporary sci-fi movie, with enough potential to have serious impact on things to come.",Serenity
352,sleeping_gorilla,"Quite good, but a bit hyped",9,7 October 2005,"First off, I did enjoy this movie quite a bit and it's on my buy list. However it's not the second coming that people are making it out to be. Joss Whedon created Buffy The Vampire Slayer, it's spin off Angel, and wrote the screenplay for Alien 4. All decent and enjoyable shows or movies. However Whedon tends to pile on too many characters in his shows. Buffy was great when it was just Buffy, Willow, Xander, Giles, Angel, and Cordelia for a foil. Faith was a nice addition but soon everyone had a girlfriend or boyfriend who just had to be on screen with everyone else. By the last seasons there were literally dozens of characters that were competing for attention. Angel took this route too, starting with three strong characters and more than doubling that number by it's forth season. Serenity starts off with so many characters that it's really difficult to keep track of, or care, about most of them. Kaylee the engineer, Wash, the ""other"" synical guy Jane are all likable but serve no real purpose in the plot of this film. They deliver a few lines and otherwise stand around. Inara is brought back in to help introduce a villain, but beyond that she does little. Basically that's 4 characters that aren't needed to get the plot. This point can be illustrated in that at the end the crew isn't whole and all the jobs on the ship are covered with people to spare. I would recommend the excellent space-action Anime called Cowboy Bebop that pulls this kind story off with a much smaller cast.Mal, Zoe, River and Simon, and to a lesser degree Mr. Universe and Shepard carry this story. It's unfortunate that they don't get quite enough dialog to flesh the characters out to their full potential. (Edit I didn't realize this movie was connected to the TV series Firefly till after I watched it.) On a positive note. The performances were all strong even the excess characters are really likable. Whedon has a gift for dialog, and except for some inconsistencies in the Old World Sailor dialect, it's fun just to hear them all talk. This may be the best Live Action Sci Fi Movie since Star Wars, really. Cowboy Bebop is better, but this is definitely a contender.2016 edit:Firely certainly wasn't perfect but it was a really fun show and after watching the series I understood more of the movie. We got a little more of the Lore from Dollhouse a few years later, but that was also sadly cancelled early. I this era of reboots and remakes. I don't understand why they haven't looked back at the potential Firefly had. This is a franchise people actually want to see make a comeback. Instead we have Star Wars and Star Trek shoved down our throats for 40+ years.",Serenity

If this does't fill you up and you are looking for a little dessert, try the series that spawned this movie, Firefly. It is only aired one season before some Hollyweird Exexcutard decided to cancel it, but it's just as good as the film.

It is a humorous, adventurous, mystery with every possible element added to it.This is one of Joss Whedon's best works (in my opinion) and I have rarely seen such convincing acting in a 'space flick', as my sister called it. The clichés are embraced and made fun of, the storyline is versatile and excellent. I rented this on a whim when I weighed either Red Eye or this against one another and, obviously, chose Serenity. I was extremely impressed and surprised, especially by the cast that has often been incorporated in other Whedon works (i:e Angel, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, obviously Firefly...)I give this a ten out of ten and suggest that anyone who has the means and ability to see this movie SEE IT IMMEDIATELY!",Serenity

356,dalbuc,Good not Great,6,5 February 2006,"Disclaimer: I've never seen the Firefly TV show.This movie wasn't bad film but it is grossly overrated here by the Joss Whedon fanboy types.The world is interesting and reasonably well imagined -as much as you'll get in feature film. There's nothing ground breaking and new. The Alliance is just the Empire in a new dressing and the Independents are the Rebels. The main character (Mail) is a Han Solo rapscallion type with a bit more edge and some good dialog. The secondary characters are where the movie falls flat - I can't tell you one interesting thing about any of them. There's a couple, there's the Bill Paxton from Aliens wannabe, there's a doctor and then there is River the LeeLu from the 5th Element knockoff who looks like Wednesday Addams all grown up. None of them are really interesting.The plot line is a space Xfiles where the Alliance build a super- well I'm not sure super what- being but River is it. He's psychic and a killer kung fu artist. She knows a terrible secret the alliance wants to protect and she escapes and gets taken abroad Mal's ship. The secret is pretty juvenile in sort of a General Jack Ripper kind of way. Pretend you can't replace secret about the alliance with ""plans for the Death Star"" because the effect is the same.The best character is Chiwetel Ejiofor (Dirty Pretty Things) as a fanactial assassin for the Alliance who is the best acted and by far most complex character in this work. He's got all the good lines. Whedon wants this film to have snappy dialog but his actors can't deliver the lines or he can't get the right timing. Either way you might smile once in awhile but the dialog isn't real crisp and it is at times very obvious when it is trying to be funny and failing.The human action sequences are tolerable. The kung fu action is well filmed (no shaky camera, close ups and quick cuts) but Wednesday Addams just isn't very good at martial arts so the fights are dead slow as she goes the motions. The gun fu action is pretty good. Space characters with bullet firing weapons is a nice touch. The space action looks great but is very limited except one huge battle and then not very meaningful - and sort of the end result of a Galaxyquest like twist.Chiwetel Ejiofor's efforts put this film over the top from being just average to being above average.",Serenity
357,annyard1960,superb,10,28 March 2012,"If you haven't seen this movie, make sure you watch the 13 episodes made for TV first. Then you will know and understand the universe this story takes place in, the characters, their back-stories, and their interpersonal dynamics - before you watch the movie. Great effort was made to make the movie stand alone, but you just can't experience the full benefit of the movie without watching the 13 episodes first. Most of them were excellent.The movie was an amazing construction. The characters, action, dialog, special effects... everything - was an integrated whole. Every event, action and sentence uttered naturally and seamlessly serves two or more purposes.The first 20 minutes was an amazing accomplishment to watch --- or carefully study if you're a writer or filmmaker. You must watch it again and again from a writer or storyteller point of view to appreciate the mastery of how he introduces the characters and their background in such a folded yet seamless, creative way. From an induced dream within a pair of flashbacks, and finally to present day where a single continuous 10 minute shot introduces us to all the main characters and the entire spacecraft known as Serenity. For movie lovers, all this flows into your consciousness smooth as silk. To those who write or make movies, carefully watching how this was done is a lesson in mastery and perfection.The movie is chock full from start to finish. Even when the action slows down for a while, the content and pace flow continuously. We're always seeing something, learning something, anticipating something, wondering which cliff this train is headed over the edge of. And most of the time it does feel like the characters are headed over a cliff. And indeed, the movie even delivers on this with the sad demise of two of the beloved main characters, and several minor characters. These deaths splash the cold hard serious reality of this story into our faces, making clear this is not a typical day for Serenity and her crew. No, this big time, this is do or die time. And die they do, some of them.The theme of the series, made clear and sharp by this film, is freedom and individuality versus the tyranny of slavery, marketed effectively by the enslavers as benevolent. Sadly, in the world we live in today, most people will side with the predators who enslave (the fascist alliance) rather than individuals who simply want the freedom to live their own life, even if the price is to live in the harsh, dangerous outskirts of the solar system. In a way, this is the story of the few remaining living, breathing, awake human beings in a solar system almost completely jammed full of beaten down and brainwashed sheeple. Just like real life on earth today, where the masses accept, defend, praise, sanction, defend and finance the predators who prey upon them and everyone else.Much firefly back-story is answered by this film. The film starts with Simon breaking sister River out of the brainwashing/programming chamber where she was abused by government for their nefarious purposes. We also learn almost everything about the elusive ""reevers""... as does the alliance and everyone else in the solar system before credits roll.The acting is superb all around. The alliance assassin is the most compelling villain since Anthony Hopkins in ""Silence of the Lambs"" - one magnificent character and portrayal.The special effects are excellent, but are never on screen to impress, only to portray the locations and events of the story.Every movie has flaws, but the flaws in this film will be invisible to most, and tolerable even for people like me who are sticklers for realism (things like the actual size of a solar system and the lack of gravity in space). Frankly, by restricting the Firefly/Serenity universe to a single solar system with no faster-than-light travel or phasers or photon-torpedoes or transporters or food-replicators, the universe of this sci-fi series is probably the closest to realistic we are ever likely to see. And it doesn't hurt, it helps, which is something I wish sci-fi writers would notice! Bottom line: superb movie! Watch the 13 TV episodes first, then watch this great movie. It will remain one of your favorites for the rest of your life. And by the way, this movie is one you can watch several times every year, and enjoy it every single time.

This is a very engaging and interesting sci-fi universe, and I enjoyed the fact that the movie sort of threw me into the deep end of the pool and let me swim - not too much spoon-feeding of background and such. I like figuring things out for myself and not being babied too much. Another thing I really enjoyed, as a first-time visitor to this universe, was the language which the characters use. It was obviously the language of their future-time, a sort of English, but with some peculiarities, and appeared to take an Asian written form. Hmmm.. Well, who knows, it could happen.

It was nice that they had all the people from the series in it but there had not been any real growth (ok was only 6 months from the end of the series but the doctor would have changed more) and we did not learn any more about them apart from River. They seemed to rip off anything they could from other sci-fi films and if you can watch the escape from the town without thinking of a certain pod race you must have missed a star wars film (even the same engine noise!!!!)There is 1 thing joss is good at and that was the Buffy universe he should have just made the Angel film that people keep talking about instead of this second rate sci-fi!",Serenity
361,north-julie,"A very good film, but constraints leave it just short of greatness",8,17 April 2006,"After a brilliantly paced opening sequence that lasts around ten minutes, the screen fades to complete blackness and the word SERENITY comes into focus. The outline of a ship appears around behind the word, and the camera pulls back to reveal a rugged looking spaceship gliding through the atmosphere of a planet. Accompanied by a superb musical score, this fifty second scene is one of the most magical introductions i have ever seen. effortlessly combing state of the art cgi with a soft slice of music, this is a beautiful sight. After this we are introduced to the crew of serenity via another (unbroken) sequence that gives newcomers just enough information to go on concerning personalities/roles on the ship/relationships.I say newcomers because serenity is not an introduction to this universe. the short lived firefly series that was cancelled by fox in 2002 was the introduction. i had never heard of it before watching serenity, and only knew about the film after spotting a TV advert for it. in that thirty seconds i was hooked onto the effects and humour. Joss whedon, the brains behind Buffy and Angel is the man responsible for firefly and serenity, and even though the show was cancelled and the film a flop, he has done a great job in creating a world and set of characters that we can love and relate to. And to be fair, with fox cancelling everything they don't understand and universal not bothering to give serenity any kind of strong marketing campaign, joss is not at fault for the way the series and film have performed.I have now seen the entire fourteen episode run of firefly, and it has to be said that the series is better than the film. the characters were given more room to develop, and in a film with only two hours to fill, some characters (Wash, Kaylee) are pushed to the fringe as they look for a reason to be in the film. Indeed, apart from Wash's death, he only has a few comedic lines that make him stand out (and even then only as the comedy relief). It is river tam and Mal Reynolds who are the focus of this film, and it suffers slightly because of that.In the series it is touched on briefly about the fact that river is a psychic and possibly a human super-weapon, but here in serenity she is able to break free and show who she really is. Mal is the captain of serenity and is presented as a hero, but not an ordinary hero. over the course of the film Mal shoots three unarmed men, which sets him apart from other heroes. the great thing about this character is that hes not a stereotypical action hero. yes he is tall and good looking and makes jokes, but he also has a dark side, brought about by the defeat of his army in a past war with the planet-ruling alliance.The alliance are serenity's version of the Empire, and while their fleet of star-ships is not regularly seen, it does feature in the films most outstanding action sequence when serenity attempts to force its way down to the surface of a planet.The plot concerns river being rescued from an alliance military school masquerading as a school 'for the gifted' by her brother Simon. He brings her on board serenity to protect her from the alliance (although an unarmed transport vessel that is always in the news for pulling illegal jobs is probably not many peoples first choice of a safe hiding place). The alliance send emotionless 'operative' chiwetel ejiofor after her, and he tracks serenity until the inevitable final battle. in an earlier battle between Mal and the operative, Mal is roundly beaten but saved by a perfectly timed exploding pile of incense set up by Mal's on and off lover inara. Later the operative attempts to disable Mal by severing the nerves that control his lower body. However, Mal doesn't have those nerves anymore, as they were hit by debris while he was in battle many years ago. The operative is able to track serenity yet he cant finish the job. Such dispension of disbelief at the continuing failure of the operative is necessary to enjoy the film, as one minute hes impossible to beat and the next he has a golden chance to kill the crew but orders his men to 'stand down.' but this is a minor gripe in such a great movie. it has great effects and humour ('were gonna explode? i don't wanna explode!) and great characters. Mal is the hero bordering on anti hero, Jayne is the girlie named muscular man, Zoe is the warrior woman, Kaylee is the cute and innocent sex obsesses engineer, inara is the 'whore' as Mal politely puts it, wash is the wisecracking pilot, Sheppard Book is the bible quoting human opposite of Mal, Simon the weaselly doctor and river the small but powerful teenager who at one point manages to beat up a bar full of over-sized men. Apart from those nine and the operative the film lacks any consistent character (Mr universe is a tech-no nerd who may as well be called Mr exposition) so its imperative that we like the crew of serenity. and we do, because nobody writes entertaining characters like Joss whedon does.enjoy the stunts and humour and pay attention to the twist halfway through the movie (concerning firefly regulars the 'reavers' and you will certainly enjoy serenity a lot more than sci fi warhorse star wars (at least the prequels anyway).Mal says late on 'could be bumpy'. that sums up this film. bumpy in places (a couple of dodgy effects spring to mind) but serenity is a smooth ride overall.",Serenity
362,acts2120,No Brilliant work goes un-ignored,10,1 March 2006,"Just as no good deed goes unpunished, this brilliant work of Joss Whedon's failed to get the respect and appreciation it deserved, in either the TV incarnation, or the big screen.First, I must make reference to the brilliant cast. The actors are simply wonderful. They each bring a depth to their characters that is multi-dimensional and unique. They are very real, but still highly complex. The acting in the movie is wonderful simply because it is so understated. The Operative is fantastic, and his smooth, almost gentle persona is a great contrast to the intense, driven Capt. Reynolds.Storyline - brilliant. Special Effects - incredible. Writing - in a class by itself. Thought provoking, funny, unique. Stunts - breath-taking. Literally - I gasped more than once, and nearly screamed a couple of times.I love Joss Whedon's work - he's a master of making something that is timely and serious, and yet still has the ability to be funny and not take ITSELF too seriously. If you like sci-fi, you will find that this 'cowboy diplomacy' style world is far more complex and believable than anything either Lucas or Rodenberry created. (and I'm a huge Trek fan). Better by far the the recent Star Wars Movies, which were all flash but no substance. Dare i say that this actually may have been the PERFECT sci-fi movie??",Serenity
363,BronwynN,The best space opera since Star Wars,9,8 October 2005,"I don't get out much, but I'm glad I could make it out to see Serenity. While it is true that Mal was quite a bit darker in this film than on the series, it makes it more believable -- I couldn't quite believe that a soldier who went through what Mal did during the War and still be sunny and generous. I was also glad to see the background material on the Tams.I guess I was naive not to realize that the Serenity crew made most of its income through illegal means, which is made completely plain here (-5 points for Bronwyn!), but I also was quite sure that they never took a life that didn't need to be done -- and that was certainly true.I wish I could discuss that last 30-45 minutes, because it was scary, funny, and sad all at the same time. However, not wanting to give away the ""blow-out"" I can say that my husband, Star Wars fan deluxe, said ""This wasn't in Star Wars, and this is better for this. He was was also convinced, as am I, that Serenity may well be this generation's Star Wars.It should therefore be no surprise I shall definitely be buying this when it comes out on DVD -- probably as a preorder so I can see it again immediately. And it should also be no surprise that I can't wait for the next Serenity movie.Does anyone hope that there might be a revival on the series on the distant horizon? Bronwyn",Serenity
364,andersondavidthomas,"If you haven't watched the show, you'll be lost and won't care about the characters",9,3 July 2020,"Serenity is the sequel to one of the best Western science fiction tv show ever made, Firefly. We're brought back to our favorite crew with some having separated to live out their own lives. But after a bounty hunter begins to hunt the character River the whole crew gets forced back together to fight a battle so much bigger than their own crew.I love this movie. The Firefly universe is defenitly one that belongs to the spotlight. First let's talk about a few things I did not like
1. Is not good as a stand alone film, it is meant to be watched after the series
2. While interesting and definitely scary, the Reavers were more terrifying not on screen. The tension of never seeing a full Reaver set you on edge. In Serenity you get Reavers all over making them a physical fear rather than a mental an emotional fear. I love the story with the Reavers, it's very clever and good, I just liked the tension with them not on screen
3. We never learn who Bishop really is and why he's so important
4. River being highly trained in combat was kind of random. They tied that in very well, but I feel as if it really could have been done better
5. We don't have more. The ending leaves room for more movies or a continuation of the TV series. Yet here we are, these many years later missing Mal and the remaining crew of the Serenity to make a return. Maybe one day.Over all I recommend this movie. No movie is perfect and anyone can nitpick but it's a Firefly movie. It gives you what you want and leaves you satisfied, heartbroken, and wanting more.",Serenity
365,geophyrd,Just amazing. Go see the flick. Instant classic,10,2 October 2005,"Just amazing. Go see the flick. You won't be sorry.Every once in a while (well, to be honest, usually all the time) I read, see or hear something to which I want a sequel. Some projects just demand them. Other projects just need closure. Still more projects exist purely between my ears and they have an inner life.Examples might include any of the Romero Dead movies (let's face it...not one is a sequel to another and that probably explains the series' unevenness), another Indiana Jones movie, another Frank Miller Batman series. Sometimes, since no one else seems interested, I come up with them. Anyone want to hear my sequel to Luka by Suzanne Vega? Or Rent II? How about Dawn of the Dead II (original, not remixed)? But most of them simply aren't very good. Usually I'm disappointed (any movie made by George Lucas in the past 15 years, most Steven Spielberg movies made for the last, oh, 15 years, and about 99% of every sequel.Serenity isn't one of those. For all my hopes for the flick, it surpassed every one. It is an instant classic, better than the TV series which makes it better than most forms of entertainment.For all the press about the movie, go rent the TV dvds. Watch two and you'll watch them all, one right after the other. They're too good to stop. But then go see the movie and it will rock your world.Just amazing. Go see the flick. You won't be sorry.",Serenity
366,LauraLeeWasHere,The Christian View of the Perfectly Crafted Sci-Fi Action Adventure.,9,26 November 2020,"No aliens in this one just a sci-fi film with a difference because of its wonderful ensemble cast led by Nathan Fillion and written and directed by Joss Whedon. Based on the popular but short run TV series Firefly, Serenity takes it to the next level and beyond. What can I say? I love it on so many levels and it has something for everyone, including me.
References to sex but none shown, violence in many areas but more intense than graphic. There is swearing but it's made-up words in a make-believe hybrid of English and Mandarin.
There are Christian themes and the nature of faith is discussed because one of the main characters is a minister. There is a reason it's a cult classic and the fans are hardcore and lifelong. My ""allegiance"" as a ""Browncoat"" (name for its fans) has softened throughout the years but I still watch it with love and respect for its themes of friendship, family, redemption, and sacrifice and for its great plot, excellently directed.
If you are watching a DVD make sure to catch the Director's commentary special feature. Joss is so clever and funny and knowledgeable you get a whole new appreciation for the film and its actors while watching it ""with"" him. He gives us a wonderful balance between telling us technical elements, anecdotal, behind-the-scenes extras as well as his clever and funny personal wisdom.
Close to the perfect Sci-Fi flick. And I haven't even mentioned the fabulous soundtrack with wonderful elements of guitars and violins that underscores and enhances every scene without intruding. But soon I'll be gushing like a schoolgirl in love instead of the respectable, Christian lady in her fifties I am. Sort of.
And did I mention all the catchphrases that edged their way into my everyday vocabulary and are still there all these years later? Okay, okay. I'll stop now.

367,delnegro-IMDb,"Good, but not on par with the TV series",7,17 October 2005,"Let me start by saying I loved the series (Firefly). Apart from 2 or 3 weaker episodes, I thought it was the best sci-fi series of the last 10 or 20 years. The plots weren't brilliant, but they didn't get in the way, and the series didn't waste any time with Star Trek style pseudoscience. There were plenty of jokes and plot twists, good acting, etc..Unfortunately, the movie is not up to the quality of the TV series. Or rather, it's perhaps on par with the weakest episodes, but the plot holes become more obvious and the jokes and twists get more spread out. The story is predictable, most of the battle sequences are too confusing and too random, and the actions of most characters make very little sense. At times, it feels like something written by James ""plot hole"" Cameron. Not only is the movie comparatively weak, but it burns a lot of bridges, making it virtually impossible to continue the series from the point where it was cancelled (and doesn't even shed light on some of the more obvious questions from the series, such as the men with blue hands or Shepherd Book's past).If you've watched all the original episodes and want a new ""fix"", go see the movie, but don't get your hopes too high. And if you haven't seen the series, do yourself a favour and buy the Firefly DVD set.",Serenity
368,zgamer-1,This best little sci-fi that people aren't watching.,8,3 May 2006,"I was recommend this movie by a friend of mine. He kept saying how it was one of his favorite movies of all time. I personally had never seen the original show ""Firefly"", which shares the same creator, so I didn't know what to expect. What I got was totally different.This movie, though not on my instant classics list, is still an incredibly enjoyable movie for people who like science fiction or don't. In fact, you can't really say it's just sci-fi. It's a sci-fi, a western and an action film all blend into one, sprinkled with a touch of comedy within (it's actually pretty funny in a generally deadpan way).What makes the movie so good is its originality. From the humor to the production design to the plot development, this film is a one of a kind movie. My only complaint on this part, however, is that the originality will seem kind of awkward and bizarre and certain points, like some of the ships used by the Reavers (pretty much a savage version of the Klingon's from Star Trek).The acting, despite having no truly recognizable stars other than Alan Tudyk, is quite good. Nathan Fillon is great as a Han Solo meets tormented space marine captain of the title ship, bringing good action sequences and dry humor to the screen. The standout, however, is Summer Glau as River Tam, a mentally unstable young girl transformed to become a killing machine.The story is packed with wit, humor, and interesting characters. The plot is constantly moving, throwing twists and turns into your train of thought just as you think you figured it out. That said and done, some may find this confusing, since it seems like Joss Whedon wants you to feel confused by the intellect laced in the dialog.The technical aspects of Serenity are quite impressive. The music is an interesting mix of sci-fi and western scores. The sound, from the Reavers' roars to the weapons on the ships, are all interesting and, at points, kind of funny. The visuals are amazing, immersing the viewers in the details of the ships and space. The cinematography, on the other hand, may feel a bit awkward at points. It's not bad, quite impressive mostly, but the hand-held-like zooming in space and sometimes TV show-ish look may make the film feel strange.Don't let any of my negative comments deter you from this film. This is definitely recommended to any sci-fi fan. You won't regret it.",Serenity
369,Kronos-8,Only for Firefly fans,4,5 March 2007,"My twenty-something nephew said this movie was awesome. So, when Costco had it for eight bucks, I figured, why not? If you weren't/aren't a fan of the TV series on which it was based (""Firefly"", which evidently was canceled after one season for good reason), ""Serenity"" won't do much but confuse and bore you. Hipness for hipness' sake, a convoluted version of the English language to speak dialog that isn't really worth hearing in the first place, predictable plot progression -- all of this in a film that goes on way too long for what it does. Some fight scenes are worth it. But, again, if you weren't a ""Firefly"" viewer -- and I wasn't -- you'll feel as if you came in during the middle of the story, not the beginning.Only for fans and geeks. 4/10",Serenity
370,manwithaplan42,Don't even try to stop the signal.,10,19 April 2006,"Y'know, I kinda regret not going to the cinema to see this. Maybe my minute contribution in may have made this film more of the success it deserved to be rather than the flop it was. I just hope the DVD sales compensate for the bad (and rather heart breaking) failure. I was blown away by this film. I had read about it in a magazine and was interested. I learned about Firefly and borrowed some DVD's from a friend, I really liked the series. Unfortunately I just never made it to the cinema so I had to wait for the DVD release. The characters getting so deep you can't see the bottom. In many shows and movies you have character archetypes such as ""moody"" and ""reckless"". The characters in Serenity have facets, not synopses. The action scenes are better than Star Wars and the whole silence is space thing that they do is very atmospheric. Joss Whedon should be knighted, awarded a Medal of honour and made King of the entire Universe. Well done!",Serenity
371,simpsjd,See this film in the theater!,9,2 October 2005,"Now I am certain that my comments will echo most of the fans out there at the same time, everyone who worked on this picture did a fantastic job! The cast whom most of us have come to enjoy in several of Joss' small screen, truly explode onto the big screen and present themselves as though it was where they belonged. As with any Joss production there are moments of bliss, deep sadness and intense adulation, and here there is no exception. The time that has passed from the far too early end of the firefly series to our immersion into the now runs flawlessly. Mal is still getting into trouble Zoe is still his right hand, Wash is still madly in love with Zoe and an incredible pilot, Jayne still wants to fight, Kaylee is twiterpated over the Simon and it is anyone's guess what River will do next. I felt progression through this film was spectacular and found myself wanting more, not more from the picture just another story; which to Whedon's credit once again proves he is a master story teller. Obviously in my eyes the motion picture was everything I wanted and more, I do not expect everyone to be as satisfied at the same time if you do not see this film on the big screen, you will have cheated yourself out of a fantastic ride.",Serenity
372,almonetts,Serenity soars in re-defining this genre of films,10,4 November 2005,"Written and Directed by Joss Whedon and starring Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres and Chiwetel Ejiofor.There is a point in the movie when a principal character says to himself, ""I am a leaf on the wind, watch me soar!""Seemingly applying this mantra, Serenity does indeed soar as it aims to re-define its own genre.The film tells the tale of a band of renegades on board their spaceship (Serenity) and is based on the very short lived and unjustifiably canceled Fox TV series, ""Firefly"". It is about five hundred years in the future; Earth is overpopulated and we have begun to take up residence in another galaxy, made habitable by our own designs; the interplanetary system and galaxies are recovering from a brutal civil war. Mal (wonderfully played with comic and action-hero gusto by Fillion) is the captain and his crew consists of other characters who in some shape or fashion owe their life to him, since they were all on the losing end of the war. The nature of the conflict stemmed from the totalitarian measures adopted by an intergalactic government ""The Alliance"" to promote its principles of unity and peace at any cost. This synopsis is expertly captured within the first five minutes of the movie, and gives a great introduction to anyone who has never seen the series. The ship picks up two fugitives, one of whom has a secret which tests the mettle of the crew and the metal of the rickety ship, time and time again. The action sequences are entertaining. Most notably are the comparative differences to other space-type movies: the bravura sense of style, extremely witty dialogue and quips, the comradery of the cast and blisteringly relevant politico-social commentary. Masquerading as a Space-Western, it is cheeky positing, is this really the ""final frontier""?. Serenity espouses philosophy from great poets to fortune cookies and characters in venting their frustrations, use a very old (probably bastardized) Chinese dialect. The cast is well lead by Fillion and superbly supported by Torres ( Alias) and Ejiofor (Dirty Pretty Things, Love Actually). Ejiofor, is splendid as ""The Operative"" from the Alliance. The TV series is already considered to be a cult classic and the movie should easily bring additional fans on board. Part of the fun for both old and new viewers is the ability to connect the dots in the various back stories. I'd be so bold as say that Whedon's ability as a writer is never to be questioned and he adeptly teases, gives new character information, and involves the viewers in considering the fate of each character. Anyone familiar with his work on Buffy and Angel, knows him as an expert, in this regard. He packs more story in the film's 120 minutes than George Lucas did for the entire of Episodes 1 through 3. His direction though reveals one or two made for TV moments, but this doesn't distract from the quality viewing and fun on screen. The film is not just another sci-fi movie. It is a pity that many have not seen it on the big screen, but given its status as one of the best popcorn flicks of the year, it will be a must own DVD, upon release.",Serenity

The sarcastic humor was a bit too ubiquitous - indeed, these no-names have no business preening - but it was easily overlooked due to the impressive acting and moments of keen emotion.A big flaw, though, is that the story was much too complex to compress into a single, feature-length film. The television series, I imagine since I've never seen it, is probably much better. Of course, the special effects budget would suffer, but does that really matter? There's a remarkably interesting narrative underpinning that would probably work even better in novel form (but, then again, almost Everything would).After watching this movie I felt a great sense of satisfaction that is quite rare.

374,nemo183,A triumph over adversity.......,10,25 December 2005,"This a difficult movie to score. Certainly, it works well by it's self, without having seen the previous 13 TV episodes. As is well documented, these were not only shown out of order, but I believe some were never aired. Given the amount of junk on TV, it is beyond all understanding why the TV series was treated so badly - and almost vindictively.Back to the film. $40 million seems to have gone a long way - it never appears to be a budget film, more like a $80 million film.Followers of the TV series might agree that in the normal course of events the film would have been a more natural event if it had followed a second season of TV.As things stand, there is an initial shock when the film is forced, through lack of time, to crash right into what might have been the end of several years of TV seasons.Even so, although most viewers will have benefited greatly from prior knowledge of the TV series, the film still works as a stand alone piece. The special effects are special, the plot works fine. In comparison to ""Doom 3"", it is a masterpiece.Here in the UK the cinema release got virtually zero publicity, but with a bit of luck the video sales should squeeze the project into profit. The very fact it was made at all is a shining example of viewer/fan power.Finally, over the last part of the closing credits, we get a reprise of the original theme song - but with slight changes, which I reckon were forced due to copyright problems.I should imagine there is probably a film to be made about how hard it was to make this film - and I should imagine several Hollywood ""BigWigs"" would be seen for what they really are, let alone the disgraceful efforts Fox made to bury the whole project. You really do have to wonder why.",Serenity
375,Trangor,"Star Trek is Dead, Long Live Serenity",10,11 October 2005,"Although there is a definite reward here for fans of the original Joss Whedon series, Firefly, this is a movie that stands on its own. The original cast of the TV series returns in the film edition bringing their considerable talents with them. The movie can't bring the depth of character development to the screen that the series did, but succeeds nonetheless by setting scenes that bring the actors to life and entertain.And the acting is good. These are people you want to watch. Some of the tension between captain and crew seemed overly contrived. But the tone of the movie is just right. It doesn't take itself too seriously but also doesn't fall to the level of camp or farce. It is good sci-fi ala space opera. The cast has fun with it and the audience will too. Snappy dialogue, lots of action, good acting... it reminded me of the first Star Wars movie.So. enjoy! And... if you like it (if Sci-fi is your preference, you will) you have the additional pleasure of picking up the DVD of the Firefly series. The DVD content is complimentary to the film and vice-versa (as I am sure was Whedon's intent).

No doubt the Firefly series has honed the characters, they are well developed, sharp and witty. You can sense the chemistry. Every line they speak makes sense, every scene is a joy to watch.

377,mesmeric,Joss Whedon is truly my new god!,10,1 October 2005,"As a browncoat, I expected to enjoy Serenity, but it was more than that. It is really the first scifi epic meant for an adult audience and by epic, I mean the entire series. There are no cutesy robots, no talking plushy toy creatures, no cartoonish one-dimensional characters. It is also refreshingly devoid of many of the cloying set pieces in other scifi series; there are no awestruck fanboy reverential views of Serenity like the interminable shots of the Enterprise in the first Star Trek movie, no awestruck fanboy reverential moments when characters pop up on screen for the first time (""Spock!"" ""Bones!"" ""Uhura!""). Serenity gets down to business from the first moment and like a good novel, not a word is wasted; like a good painting, there is not one misplaced brushstroke. Each character is real and complex and acts from their own motivation. There is never a sense that an unseen director is pushing them around like cut out figures; in fact, you get the real sense that if an unseen director tried to do that, the characters would rebel and kick his ass.This movie will probably not win the Golden Globe or a Best Picture Oscar because the Academy seems to only give those to films about ""star-crossed lovers"" with English accents giving each other longing glances during World War Two or playing large concert instruments for the Nazis. The Academy may even become confused about Serenity and think it is a foreign film because there is some use of Chinese in this film without subtitles; in any case, the Academy has a history of only giving the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar to foreign films that are dubbed in English. None of the Serenity actors may win Oscars because for that honor, the Academy seems to favor people like the cute Italian guy who made that film about how hilarious the concentration camps were. Oh, those funny Nazis and their practical jokes! But this series has already won the real honors in the hearts and minds of fans and has the ability to impress those who've never seen the original series or who don't even like science fiction particularly. It is not a fan movie, it is not a geek movie, it is a work of art. If you haven't seen it yet, go today. If you've already seen it, go again. I plan to do that for two reasons. First, because it is just one of the best damn movies I've ever seen (and I am a film buff!) and second, because it will send a financial message to Hollywood that this is the sort of visionary film I want to see, not some remake of a 1960's sitcom, not some ridiculous ""action movie"" written by a committee and watered down by focus groups. I want to see real character-driven films that take me somewhere I've never been before and that make me laugh, and choke up and think, damn it! And they can be scifi or westerns, or crime drama, or historical pieces, but they better be as good as Serenity or I will withhold from Hollywood the price of my admission ticket.",Serenity

I really liked it a lot. Some things have been ""altered"" for American cinema (and for people new to Serenity) but all was well done. A bit sad (particularly to anyone coming into this after getting hooked on Firefly) but VERY well done. In my opinion, Joss is a genius. One other person titled their rating ""Not exactly like the TV show; judge it on its own merit.""

It is also, however, a crucial battle during which the character Capt. Mal Reynolds' side, the rebels, lost their independence to the Alliance, a huge Sino-American power that rules the solar system (a new one) and is responsible for making the planets of that solar system inhabitable... to varying degrees. Got that? Well, it's okay if you don't quite yet.Pretty much the important people are a ragtag group of outsiders who live their lives finding work, honest or dishonest (don't much care which) on the untamed frontier of the Outer Planets. (Think Tatooine.) Things are always hectic and frequently dangerous, but become much more so when two passengers find their way on board: Simon Tam, a young man once on his way to the top who sacrificed everything to rescue his younger sister; and River Tam, his sister whose profound genius made her a victim of cruel experimentation by the Alliance government. Alright, that's the premise, and that's all the time I want to spend on the facts. Now, onto subjectivity! Much as I wanted this movie to amaze me, I was very worried that it would not. Joss Whedon is one of my idols, but he has never before created a motion picture (laymen might know him from the TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and he has until now been a TV guy). Both of my feelings were correct: it was indeed amazing, and I would say it did also have problems. Let me explain.First (because it's less fun), the bad. The pacing was less of a problem than I had feared, but the movie still did not have the rhythm of most movies you are likely to see. Partially, of course, this is a positive thing: the cliché arc of a plot is not entirely desirable. However, events happened in such a way that even a seasoned fan like myself could not incorporate things quickly enough, and spent much of the movie slightly disoriented. By far a bigger problem for me, however, were the story lines. EVERYTHING is concluded, and that made me very sad. Let me emphasize that, had this been a movie like any other, the conclusions would have been perfectly acceptable. But one of the things that made all of Joss Whedon's work and especially Firefly unique was simply how MUCH each episode contained -- there were enough subplots, which advanced at a naturally slow pace, that a single movie could not do them justice and bring them to conclusion. As a result, character and plot arcs simply *end*, at the right place of course but far before the right time. It is such a letdown to see everything you wanted to happen on the show over whole seasons happen in a single three-minute scene, and there's no way to alleviate that no matter how wonderful that scene is.Oooh! Okay, now good stuff. First of all, the writing was as excellent as I had hoped, the occasional clichés always parodying themselves or ending with a wonderful surprise (in particular, one exchange late in the movie right before a big-scary-death-showdown almost lost me, but then ended with a wonderful and surprising line that only made me love the characters involved that much more -- you'll know it when you see it. People clapped). Something that will strike Firefly fans is how intense this entire movie is. I jumped in my seat a few times, one of which happened in the very first scene. The final battle, and the raggedly emotional moments, are what you would expect from an action movie only ten times more involving -- there is more darkness in the characters, and the climax will have you wondering how they'll make it through, not in an interested but eternally optimistic way, but kind of in a hopeless way. If you always wanted to be one of the characters in the series, you might see this movie and be glad that you aren't, because they really go through a hell of a lot.I laughed, I gasped, I put my hand on my heart near then end and it stayed there for nigh half an hour, I (almost) cried, and when the Firefly theme song began to play during the end credits I sang along because I felt a compulsion to do so. If that doesn't make sense to you now, see the movie. Afterwards I felt raw, I felt shocked, I felt amazed, I felt happy, and I felt entertained. I did not feel let down. And let me tell you, I did NOT feel ready to leave.Note: I am a fan of Whedon and Firefly, and write from that viewpoint. I saw an advance screening hosted by Joss himself at Wesleyan University, Joss' and my college of choice, but this was definitely the final product. I did my best, but this movie was difficult to review just because of how DIFFERENT it is than most movies you see at the theatre.Another Note: The fights scenes ruled.",Serenity
380,BdR76,"Mediocre story about space zombies, for hardcore ""Firefly"" fans only...",4,28 December 2005,"The first entire hour of the movie is very chaotic and this is mainly due to bad editing. It jumps from scene to scene in such a frenzied way that you can't make sense of it at all. Who is this? Where are they now? What the hell are they doing? If you make it through to the second half, it will finally makes sense but what's left is a mediocre story about space zombies. There are still some nice scenes, like when the huge spaceships emerge from the fog or when they arrive on the surface of the planet Miranda, but that's about it.Apart from the editing, i thought the acting and dialogue wasn't good as well. When the main group of characters is introduced, they say things like ""i don't wanna explode"" or ""we gonna crash again?"" in a very casual i-don't-care manner. This was probably supposed to tell the audience that they're a tough crew of people who've already seen everything. But to me it seemed they were just annoyingly sarcastic. And for example after an intense spacecraft chase, when someone asks ""are you alright"", River Tam just sits there with a pokerface and replies ""i swallowed a bug"", and it's supposed to be funny... I didn't think it worked at all.Don't be fooled by the (at time of writing) high IMDb rating, this is for hardcore ""Firefly"" fans only.",Serenity

Still, it was OK, so I scored it accordingly as a 6/10 (the score I give for films when I think they could be better for whatever reason - in this case, it didn't make enough sense to deserve a better mark). That's entirely because I hadn't watched the series first - which you really need to do as it won't make sense otherwise. Now I ve watched it agin having seen the series, and it makes perfect sense, and its excellent.

My first thought was sleeping through it, but eventually, I was suckered into watching ti. The beginning is very interesting, and it seemed more like it started like an actual TV series though. The reavers were just plan creepy, and other bits and pieces of it just made it utterly repulsive at times. The fight scenes were very interestingly shot and there was a good level of humor for a sci-fi flick: not too much or too little. Because sometimes the future's a little ironic. (lol) I was also confused about how we got from Earth to space. Not like they didn't say it, but they just said everything way too fast. During the movie it was always ""the Alliance"" or ""the Parliment"" or ""the Outer-Rim planets"".The ending was interesting and I didn't understand some other aspects of it. Perhaps I have to see the series. I also didn't get why everything on the ship was in Japanese or whatever. Why is everything in the future in a weird ""alien"" language?

386,jeffthemartin,Transcends all genres,9,4 November 2005,"It would be superficial to say that Serenity is a science fiction movie. Serenity is a movie that uses genres as a foundation upon which to build a story about real people, who just happen to be vagabonds on a rusty old spaceship.The plot: Malcolm, captain of the space-ship Serenity and his crew are doing their usual gallivanting around in space, trying to eke out a living in a politically hostile environment, with one difference: their crew is temporarily supplemented by a young doctor (Simon) and his mentally unstable, but very telepathic, younger sister, River. Simon and River are fugitives from the afore-mentioned political hostility, embodied by a sword-wielding man known as ""the Operative"". The crew, the fugitives, the government, and a group of very evil secondary villains called Reavers, provide a magnificent cast of characters whose conflict (and other interactions, but mostly conflict) kept me spellbound for the entire movie.I've long been a fan of both Star Wars and Star Trek, but Serenity is better than either. Reflecting on the movie afterwards, I kept finding similarities to Star Trek: Voyager. Both shows focus on a small ship and her rag-tag crew. The crews squabble a lot, but ultimately pull together for the common good. However, I liked Serenity much more than I ever liked Voyager because it was so much more real and alive. Star Trek has science fiction, and interesting characters. Star Wars has this plus a nice background mythology and some realistic grittiness. Serenity includes all of the above, plus humor, more grittiness, sex, theft, and really nasty bad guys. The result is a realistic universe that people in this messed up world can relate to.In the last few years a lot of science fiction and fantasy movies have had two things: lots of characters with British accents, and cheesy lines. Serenity once again leaves its competitors in the dust by transcending all predictability by using fairly neutral, Chinese, and American accents, as well as a British accent from (I think) India. Instead of cheesy lines, it goes for totally-unexpected-and-hilarious, such as: ""Been more'n a year since I had anything twixt my nethers weren't run on batteries!"" There is no denying that the language is odd, and it may take you a while to get used to it. But stay with the language, because it's so worth listening to! The odd terminology and turns of phrase drive home the fact that this is not just another sci-fi copy.I've always assumed that if you notice computer graphics in a movie, it is because they are badly done. Serenity dashed this theory for me. The three or four times I noticed effects elements, they didn't take center stage or in any way distract from the movie. They simply communicated the necessary information to the audience and then got out of the way and let the story continue. The shots of planets were extremely beautiful; an excellent counterpoint to other, more disturbing, images in the movie.As I mentioned before, Serenity has some elements that border on horror. The filmmakers made an excellent decision when they decided to leave most of the disturbing imagery to the audience's imagination. The Reavers are a hideous and evil ""people"" whose presence could easily have been overplayed for shock value. But the film judiciously cuts around them, never showing more than a glimpse of their horrible faces. In place of these images are lines such as, ""You know he's better off dead than what the Reavers would have done to him."" Once again, the movie is about the characters, rather than about something as superficial as Reaver make-up.I can only think of one negative thing to say about Serenity: There were a few times during big action scenes when two characters would hold an important (and usually emotional) conversation. Obviously, in terms of sound mixing, you have to turn the environmental sounds down so that you can hear the dialog, but I think they went too far. Two or three times, the contrast of these suddenly quiet conversations broke the mood for me.On the other hand, there was another kind of mood change that I liked a lot. Being a mentally unstable psychic, River expresses a lot of her personality inside her own head. In the medium of film, it is easy to go inside someone's head, and Serenity does a marvelous job of it. I didn't grow up watching movies, so I have often found myself a little confused when movies do things like this. In Serenity it was always crystal clear to me, and the revelations brought by these psychic journeys helped connect the audience to River and her huge part in the story.Serenity is an excellent movie. It might be a little confusing at first, but if you are a action movie fan or science fiction fan at all, or if you just like great story-telling, you will like it.",Serenity
387,bartning,Not As Good As I Expected,7,8 February 2006,"I watched a few of the Fire Fly episodes, and I expected better from a feature-length film. The morals were unclear, and the movie went too quickly. However, it was entertaining, and it had some originality. Serenity crew, however, played both good and bad, including scenes where they put their money before lives, trashy views of sex, and other questionable values.The originality involved an anti-government position and plot. As stated about the movie here on IMDb, they speak Chinese sometimes, but it's been done before, including the classic _Blade Runner_. They should have spent more time on the main reason driving them, a potential secret of the Alliance.Describing the unclear morals would probably be spoilers, but certainly the movie does not make it easy to distinguish good from bad, and it's true probably to the end of the movie. I had expected more from what I saw in the series.",Serenity
388,jdfcanada,Very good,8,1 October 2005,"This was a good movie that was made only due to fans on the Net and DVD sales. Personally, it kinda reminds me of Star Trek, in that fans got producers to make a movie after the original TV series was cancelled, although it took far longer for Trekkies.Basically, the movie, like the TV series Firefly, is set about 500 years in the future, after mankind has spread out into the universe and has terra-formed dozens of planets. The crew of Serenity, is a band of ne-er do wells, former rebels and criminals who cruise the fringes of explored space and find adventure. A quick voice over in the beginning gives the uninitiated the basics, so if you've never seen Firefly, you don't have to worry.The movie has its moments and there is plenty of action and some funny one-liners, ala Indiana Jones, which helps when the movie's pace slows down for a while in the middle. All in all, it is a good, solid movie which probably won't do much business because no one seems to know about it.",Serenity
389,Tobbes,Cannot stand up to it's serialized form in any way,6,25 December 2005,"As an introduction, I think I have to state that I liked Firefly, the TV show Serenity is based on, very much. In fact, it quickly became my very favourite show across all genres. So, as they cancelled it I was nothing less than angry, because I still cannot understand why the people in charge - be that the weekly viewers or the executives that in the end pulled the plug - did not see the immense potential that lay within this series. It was fresh, full of new ideas, full of interesting characters, with a fine ensemble cast and inspired screen writing. In short: a vast new universe to be explored with interesting worlds and people and - around that - stories to be told. Later, when I heard there would be an adaption for the big screen, I was worried if it might hold up to the very high mark the TV show set. There are too many characters, too many facts and to many relations that link them all together to fit in a two hour format. I feared if a Firefly movie would be produced, all the things that _make_ that show would be left behind to create kind of a ""fast food"" movie. Quickly paced, with colorful pictures and a nice bit of rumbling in the speakers, but ultimately without anything that lasts, without soul. Well, I saw it today and I have to say it came out just the way I feared it would. Quick popcorn action with all the kaboom one could ask for while shamelessly neglecting the essential factor: people. Don't't get me wrong: if you never saw Firefly, then I'm quite sure you will be adequately entertained. But that's really all there is. The result of this big screen portation is a sadly generic sci-fi flick of the more forgettable kind. Nothing left of the originality, freshness. Nothing of the interactions between the crewmembers that made the original concept so much better then its competitors. So, in the end, I am still left to lament the end of a great show that I loved so much and to notice, that maybe the last chance of saving the concept behind that all has been wasted. I think it couldn't have worked after all. Not as a movie format. Finally, I have to put the blame on the studio that cancelled the show, for not having enough faith in a new concept to let it grow an audience. All has to be quick money, so they prefer milking but the last drop out of worn-out concepts and dead ideas instead of making way for a new one. It's a damn shame. A damn shame.",Serenity
390,yamagata@virtual-markets.net,"Josh Whedon, an excellent first major motion picture production",10,8 October 2005,"I am a fan of ""Firefly."" I went to the movie with expectations of being entertained. After the opening sequence, I was more than entertained. I was awestruck.The first minutes of the movie is full of dialog to get people that have not seen the TV series or people that are not serious fans, up to date with the show's premises. There is some new material here, so I was not totally annoyed. But, that was the only thing that bothered me about the entire movie. You just have to realize that this movie is not just for the fans of Firefly, at least that is what the studio execs would like to believe. The fast dialog in the beginning is a necessary distraction.Once the movie starts into its own main story, the action does not stop for a second. There is not a slow sequence in the movie. I saw the movie once and enjoyed it enough to view it a second time. Somewhere into the second hour of my second viewing of the the movie, I distinctly remember thinking, this is a great movie. I could see it again and again and find new things in it and not ever be bored. There are scene after scene that are composed with beauty, not just with the visuals, but with significant dialog, that is at times simplistic and at other times thought provoking. What makes it a memorable movie is that it captures my emotions, plays with them and will not let go of them. If you enjoyed ""Firefly"" and have become invested in the characters, you will find the price of a ticket one of the best investments in your life and one of the more memorable ways to spend 2 hours of your life.I love this movie and thank Josh Whedon and the cast for creating it. Let's see some more!ADDENDUM 11/14/05I had just seen this movie for the third time in the theater. This movie has got to be a classic. Even after seeing it twice before, the things that go bump and jump out at the you from the screen, still gave me that startle effect. It is like this movie is fine tuned to do this to people. I had heard that some people had seen this movie 4 or 5 times before its theatrical release and still enjoyed the movie. Now I understand why. The last comment I have is that after seeing and enjoying the movie twice before, I was amazed that there was dialog at the end of the movie that I did not understand before. It has double meaning, the ship as a metaphor for the ship's first officer. It made the movie that more meaningful to me as a work of cinematic art. This movie has some depth to it. It is not just a shallow action film. Some people think that this movie does not deserve its ""top 250"" rating. I agree with the sentiments of Roger Ebert (""Benji the Hunted""). In the end, it is the entertainment value in respect to the target audience that should be most important in rating a movie. That a movie entertains, while transports you to another world and takes you away from the mediocre tedium of life, should be a measure of its value. That is why Star Wars episode IV is rated in the ""top 100"" films. I saw that movie in the theaters 18 times. The next most frequented movie that I went to see over and over again in the theaters was Star Wars episode V, five times. That I went to see Serenty, three times in the theater is a measure of the entertainment value of this film to me.",Serenity

Add to this a bigger budget to further more enhance the visuals both outworldy and inworldly plus a really well written script and you have the movie. This is one hell of a excellent sci-fi movie. Newcomers should also be able to pick up on it to without having seen the show.

It's an entirely unique film, it manages to deal with potentially apocalyptic circumstances with a feel-good air and great laughs; something creator Joss Whedon proved he could do with Buffy. Vampires make an appearance here too. It's sharply written, witty and yet has a sci-fi storyline worthy of recognition. Particular mention to Nathan Fillion who is a terrific comic actor, you may recognise him from Slither. Summer Glau, from the Sarah Connor Chronicles also makes an appearance as River, another of Whedon's strong women.

The character development is so spot on. So many concepts fit into one film. Being a firefly fan and knowing the background I was concerned about how easily this information was going to be passed to a new audience.There were a few characters I wish were developed more. Largely because I knew them from Firefly. It didn't, however, detract fro the film in any way.True drama, true comedy, true sci if, even a true western. So much can be said about this film.If you can, just for the enjoyment of it, have a look at Firfly first but this is in no way essential.All the actors deliver every part fantastically. Except maybe David Krumhotlz as Mr. Universe. I liked the concept but it wasn't delivered well.Chiwetel Ejiofor was excellent as the Operative.All the crew of Serenity were great.

403,RMFendt,...wow.,10,7 December 2005,"Make no mistake: this is neither like Star Trek nor Babylon 5. Nor is it like Star Wars. This is better. Way, way better. ""Serenity"" is a spin-off of ""Firefly"", which is --in my humble opinion-- at the same time the best and most underrated science fiction series ever made.""Serenity"" is actually the name of a ship. Being a ""firefly"" class freighter, we see an old, battered ship that has definitely seen better times, like her crew. This one has no sleek design, or any hidden gadgets that make her exceptional. She is just a ship, old and sturdy. Her crew is a conglomerate of different characters who all have things to hide or memories to forget and who all have their own reasons for being on the ""Serenity"", forming a sort-of dysfunctional family. The captain is Malcom Reynolds, the most-cynical son-of-a-bitch I have ever seen in a sci-fi flick.And this is what makes Serenity exceptional. It is not about a revolution, not about a big war. Not about uber-humans exploring space, bringing peace and understanding everywhere. No altruistic heroes to be found. This is not George Lucas and not Gene Roddenberry. This is Joss Whedon, and thus deals with human beings. Feeling, hurting human beings.Serenity shows us what the Star Trek universe would be like if it was inhabited by actual people. We see what the price of forcibly-induced ""peace"" and ""freedom"" is. And yes, we have a sort-of ""evil empire"" as well, which is cynically named ""Alliance"". But here, the rebels have lost, because they were heavily outnumbered and outgunned. We see a society that has deep-running issues and is held together by little more than force and deceit. In this world, the ""Serenity"" and her crew try to survive, by stealing, smuggling and doing odd-jobs; they do pretty much anything short of murder, if it gives a profit.Not quite part of their little family are the Tams. Simon and his sister River. Both are quite exceptional, with Simon being a brilliant surgeon and River being nothing short of a class of her own. Both are on the run from the Alliance, and more than once Mal struggles with himself about whether it is smart to keep them aboard.Serenity is one of the most intelligent movies I have seen in a long time. It is witty as well; anyone who knows Whedon's works will expect this. But the humor mostly acts as relief for the cynical and dark tone of the film: as I said-- this is about humans, not about angels.",Serenity
404,aeon_static,GREAT movie!!,10,6 January 2006,"Too many people are saying that you have to have seen the TV series before hand to really grasp the characters and the story and truly understand this movie...I agree - partially - about the issue with being fully connected to the characters... But the way they're developed in the film makes them ""deep enough"" for you to have a healthy concern for them, though it's a concern that is anything but specific.However, all these claims that a ""newbie"" wouldn't be able to properly grasp and stay grappled to watch the movie all the way through and enjoy it are complete nonsense. I had only seen the first 3 episodes of Firefly by the time I saw this movie - and the show personally didn't interest me much, maybe because half the time I wasn't paying complete attention...I brought Serenity to my friend's house tonight. He'd never heard of Firefly, and I didn't speak a word about it, I just said, ""Check out this movie. It's kind of complicated, a lot of information flies by really fast, so just pay attention."" Complete silence throughout the entire film. It was late at night and he had to work the next morning, and he usually falls asleep in this situation even if it's a GREAT movie. He didn't fall asleep.Once the credits started rolling, and a word hadn't been said through the entire film, I leaned forward and subtly put in my opinion: ""Oh well, I thought it was good."" My friend sat there for a second then said, ""That... was a REALLY... REALLY good movie."" And I have to agree. With or without the show, this movie is great. Before tonight I had shown the movie to my family and some other friends, all of which are not into sci-fi... and they all loved it.Please, please, PLEASE make a sequel!! Promote it properly this time and I PROMISE it will do well!",Serenity
405,grobertjones,Under-rated sci-fi film,8,31 July 2018,"After a critically acclaimed run for a single season, the Firefly series was adapted to the big screen. While the TV series never captured a large audience, it showcased a strong cast and original storyline. The movie version shares the same cast and a strong script. Nathan Fillion leads a crew of renegades who travel on a space ship that gives the movie it's name. Chiwetel Ejiofor launches his career as the military agent chasing a passenger on the ship. This mysterious passenger is magnificently played by Summer Glau who steals several scenes. Fans of Firefly will love the film although will be heartbroken by the loss of a key member of the crew. Its a great movie that is very under-rated.",Serenity
406,suzy-60,The perfect sci-fi movie,9,7 January 2007,"Possibly the best science-fiction movie to come along since The Empire Strikes Back--better, in my opinion than The Matrix and other recent flicks.Yes, the plot may centre round a lithe young lady with l33t fighting skillz, but unlike many other recent sci-fi movies like Ultraviolet or Aeon Flux, the point is not to spend two hours staring at her curvy spandex-clad figure performing impossible feats of strength. Nor is the fate of the human race at stake. The tone is much more like the early Star Wars movies updated to a more cynical and edgy time, with a group of down-at-heel space adventurers striving to stay one step ahead of a regime under which most people are satisfied. Yet the movie is always gripping and suspenseful, the characters very likable and quirky, and the setting believable and ramshackle.Summer Glau as River Tam brings a waifish, unstable edge to the character that makes her extremely unsettling. Nathan Fillion fills Harrison Ford's shoes and then some as the Han Solo-esquire captain; both of them deserve to be far more well-known than they are.",Serenity
407,JWM-2,"A decent popcorn flick, but come on...",6,9 January 2006,"I went to see Serenity at the urging of one of the numerous fanboys out there, who pestered me for weeks before I finally relented. I had never seen the TV show before but had a decent idea of what the movie was about. I enjoyed the film on the big screen, it held my interest all the way through and was a likable popcorn flick (think 'The Mummy' in space).But let's set the record straight, this movie is not worth watching more than once. It never made me want to watch the TV show. It's certainly not worth buying unless you find it in the bargain bin at Blockbuster. It's an enjoyable renter on a rainy Saturday, nothing more.And to all the rabid fan reviewers here who blindly encourage people to see it more than once and buy every iota of merchandise, I say, in the words of William Shatner, ""get a life!""",Serenity

409,MrRazorz,Fear the geeks and see it anyway,9,28 December 2005,"Shortly before this movie came out, my older sister (who works as a medical receptionist) had a patient in the office who turned out to be a ""Browncoat"" - OE, a fan of the Joss Whedon sci-fi show Firefly and its movie spin off Serenity. I'm not sure how the topic came up while he was booking a doctor's appointment, but he spent about thirty minutes pummelling her disinterested ears with an enthusiastic rant about the sheer genius of the show, its vast superiority to Star Trek, Babylon 5 and every other sci-fi show ever made, and the appalling injustice of its cancellation after only 15 episodes (which, he reasoned, was due to the superior IQ of the audience who refused to buy into the merchandising). Um... right.While I'm a fan of the show myself, I've never been anywhere near that level of frenetic enthusiasm. After seeing the movie yesterday, though, I may be getting close. To put it as succinctly as I can, this movie kicks ass.For the uninitiated (like my sister) it's a sci-fi/western set 500 years from now, when humanity has spread out and terraformed a couple of hundred ""new Earths"" to live on. Some are wealthy and hi-tech, others are little more than frontier towns on barren wilderness planets. The whole show's run by your typical friendly dictatorship called the Alliance, who took over after a one-sided war a few years back.Enter Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), a war veteran (on the losing side) who's found a new niche as captain of the cargo ship Serenity. Along with his crew of rag-tag misfits, he takes whatever legitimate jobs he can get and does a fair bit of stealing and smuggling on the side. Coming along for the ride are fugitive doctor Simon Tam (Sean Maher), who's a wanted man after rescuing his teenage sister River (Summer Glau) from an Alliance facility where she was being genetically engineered into some sort of psychic assassin. The Alliance naturally wants her back - not only because she's such a valuable experiment, but also because she happens to have some very dirty government secrets buried somewhere in her pretty little head.While Simon and River's story was merely a recurring sub-plot in the TV series, it takes center stage in the movie. A deceptively charming government enforcer known only as the Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is hot on River's trail and will do anything to get her back, which is very bad news for anyone who gets in his way. This makes life even more difficult than usual for Mal and his crew, as they try to keep one step ahead of the Operative and try to figure out exactly what's inside River's head. This leads them to take a haphazard and dangerous journey all over Alliance space and beyond - into the territory of a sub-human cannibal horde known as the Reavers, where the really dirty secret lies...Naturally, the movie's a lot bigger and louder than the show but still delivers in terms of storyline and that witty Whedon dialogue. There's a lot more action (and some fairly gory violence) to be had - to risk a spoiler, the scene where River puts her ingrained combat skills to the test against a room full of psychotic Reavers has been added to my list of Coolest Fight Scenes Ever. There's also big fat doses of comedy, drama and some moments which will jump out and slap you, especially if you're familiar with the show.All the original actors are present, although a couple of them inevitably become little more than bit parts. You don't have to be familiar with the show to enjoy the movie - a friend of mine who's a Firefly virgin said he didn't have much trouble following it - but there are a couple of moments where the story gets a bit disjointed or where a bit more background might have helped. I also found the ending a bit on the corny side, but it still wraps things up nicely while leaving them open for a possible sequel (or another season?).Loved it. Seeing it again. 'Nuff said.",Serenity
410,is_everybody_going_crazy32,Must See Movie!,10,1 October 2005,"""Serenity"" is based upon the sci-fi TV series ""Firefly,"" created by Joss Whedan, who also created ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" and ""Angel."" The show was ended after one season, but due to the success of the DVD's Whedan felt he owed it to the fans to show what happens next.(from the Show) River (Summer Glau) is a very unique young girl... she's a psychic. Therefore her parents send her to a ""special"" school, where they assume it's just like a college for strange people. River, and her brother Simon, (Sean Maher) have always been best friends, so when she starts acting strange, he throws his life as a doctor, away to go find her. So what's happening to River? This school is turning her into a human weapon, which makes her a threat to anyone around.Now in the movie, Simon has finally found his beloved sister, being tested on by scientists, and bails her out to come join him on board the ""Serenity,"" hence the name. Serenity is a space ship run by Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion). His crew includes Zoe and Wash,(Gina Torres and Alan Tudyk) (they're married) Jayne, (Adam Baldwin) and Kaylee (Jewel Staite).The crew quickly discover's how much of a threat she is when she starts kicking some serious ass. So who are the bad guys in this movie? There are a couple: first there's The Operative, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, ( he was the bad-ass gangster in Four Brothers) who is sent out to kill River for being a threat; and then there are the Reavers, who are basically messed up humans who attack and eat people alive. (I know, gross, but I didn't create them...) This movie is very futuristic, and is so in a way that pulls you in just by looking at he enviorment around the characters. It's awesome to see what the future really could be like. And you don't have to be a fan of the show to understand and love the movie. The movie has frightening and surprising scenes, but also has a great amount of comedic lines in it. The actors are unknown and great, and you really do believe that they are their characters. I highly recommend seeing this movie because it gives everything you would want to see in a movie. Trust me...you wouldn't be wasting your money...",Serenity
411,InvisibleSwordsman,you can't take the sky from me.,10,27 September 2005,"To start off with, I must admit that I have been a die-hard ""browncoat""  since day one.. Therefore, if you're looking for a review see  ""Serenity"" from the perspective of a newcomer, this may not be of much  help. While the film makes a strong effort to be accessible to  non-fans, and we truly believe it will entertain most audiences, it is,  first and foremost, a ""Firefly"" movie, and we are reviewing it as such.  And what a grand ""Firefly"" movie it is - Whedon pulls-out all the stops  and takes big risks to make the sort of daring and satisfying cinematic  sci-fi spin-off that Rick Berman or Chris Carter only flirted with.  Instead of playing it safe, Whedon gives us a film that would be a more  than satisfying send-off. And let's face it, it probably will be.  ""Serenity"" begins 8 months after ""Firefly"" ended . Captain Malcolm  ""Mal"" Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), the commander of the title space  craft, still leads his motley crew of petty thieves in a life of crime,  one step ahead of the dictatorial Alliance of Planets. Among the crew  are Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and his sister River (Summer Glau). River, a  former child prodigy, has been the subject of ghastly brain experiments  by alliance scientists - and she is hardly getting more normal with  time. River is being tracked by a mysterious alliance operative  (Chitewel Ejiofor, who would like to think at least one of you will  recognize from ""Amistad"") who will stop at nothing to find her. To say  much else about the plot would give away too much - needless to say,  the crew of Serenity faces more danger than ever before, from the  Alliance, the monstrous, cannibalistic Reavers, and perhaps even from  River.  The script is chock full of the brilliantly witty banter Whedon is  famous for, and each character from the series is given their chance to  shine. As always, Alan Tudyk as Wash, Serenity's pilot, can get more  genuine laughs with his dry wise cracks than an entire ""Saturday Day  Night Live"" cast can get in a full season. Adam Baldwin as ""The Man  They Call Jayne"" is almost as funny, and continues to make his morally  ambiguous and intellectually unburdened character hit spot on. Fans of  Morena Baccarin's Inara or Ron Glass as Shepherd Book may be  disappointed at heir limited screen time, but both characters are used  effectively and have some great moments, adding dramatic weight to the  film. Those who are partial to Maher's selfless and geeky Simon or  Jewel Staite's Kaylee will have plenty to keep them very satisfied.  But the film ultimately belongs to Mal and River, who are truly the  central characters of ""Firelfy."" Fillion and Glau command the screen as  well as any major star has this year. Malcolm Reynolds is a classic  sci-fi hero - charmingly roguish, and yet tortured by demons and a  conscience that tends to show up at the most inopportune times, and  Fillion (whom we would like to think at least one of you will recognize  from ""Saving Private Ryan"")could't be better. And  Glau, as a physiologically unstable teenager, is not only worthy of  supporting actress Oscar consideration, but in the action sequences  makes Jennifer Garner, Angelina Jolie, and Tom Cruise's action  characters look like girl scouts by comparison.  Whedon has given his browncoats something that fans of ""Star Trek: The  Next Generation"" only dreamed of, by making a film that fully captures  the spirit of the original material while soaring to new heights in  taking full advantage of the cinematic medium. (Even ""First Contact,""  the best ""Next Gen"" film was too concerned about the next sequel and  the spin offs still on TV at the time to truly take it to the edge.).  Whedon the director is a true revelation here, making his $40  million-ish budget look like at least twice that, and showing equal  talent with action and character development.  If you never watched ""Firefly,"" you still have a terrific sci fi  adventure in store for you. If you have, you have something that is  truly comparable to ""The Return of the King"" or ""Star Wars"" at it's  climactic best. ""Serenity"" provides a mix of firm answers and  implications to the series dangling plot threads and the burning  questions of fans that are completely satisfying.  In getting this film made, Whedon has done the impossible, and that  makes him mighty.",Serenity

I'm a fan of ""Firefly"" so right away I had big expectations before I walked into the theater. The whole time that I was watching I was in awe. It was like watching a two hour version of the TV series. The only difference is that the movie has better special effects, more action, and a stronger story. The only problem that I had with this film were the (very brief) moments where the acting came up short. Other than that, the movie's a fine piece of work that I'm proud to say I've seen. If your a fan of ""Firefly"" like me than I'm sure that you intend on or have already seen this movie. If you haven't seen ""Firefly"" and you know nothing about it than see this film anyway.

The Core worlds became havens of industrialisation and grand cities, ruled by the Alliance, the outer rim worlds, however, reverted to Western like Societies, full of scoundrels and farmers trying to make a living. As shown in the TV series this movie follows, the Alliance tried to conquer the Outer rim worlds but met resistance at the hands of the Independants (or Browncoats as they are sometimes referred to) and war ensued. Eventually the Independants were out gunned and out numbered and the Alliance were victorious. Malcolm Reynolds fought in this war for the Independants, and when they lost, he and his first mate Zoe bought a small ship and took to the skies as Freelance mercenaries, away from Alliance oppression.All the cast from the TV show return for the movie. Nathan Fillion as the suave, rogue captain Reynolds Gina Torres as his loyal first mate and fellow war hero Zoe Washburn Alan Tudyk as ""Wash"", Zoe's husband and wise cracking ace pilot of Serenity Adam Baldwin as Jayne Cobb, the bad a$$ thug with an attitude Jewel Staite as the sweet and endearing Chief Engineer Kaylee Frye Morena Baccarin as the enchanting ""Companion"" and Captains love Interest Inara Serra Sean Maher is the Dorky yet genius Doctor Simon Tam Summer Glau as the mysterious child prodigy and Simons sister, River. And Ron Glass returns as the enigmatic Shepherd Book (albeit in a small cameo)Set six months after the events of the series, the crew of Serenity are still scouring the galaxy looking for work, legal or not. But now the Alliance as set a new enemy on them, The Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a super soldier who will stop at nothing to get his hands on River Tam before she uses her special psychic abilities to reveal the dark secrets of the Alliance and weaken their regime.Also appearing are the evil, psychotic monsters from the series known as Reavers, a band of flesh eating r@pists who destroy anyone they meet. The crew of Serenity must cross Reaver territory, avoiding both Reavers and the Alliance if they are to find the truth behind the Alliances evil and Rivers special powers.This movie is excellent! In short.... The cast are all back and on form as if they had never left. Joss Whedon has created a truly great universe equal to the Star Wars and Star Trek universes that the viewer can emerge themselves in and get lost in the action and great characters. Nathan Fillion is a star in the making.....I truly hope they make a second season of the series and/or a sequel to this movie, as there is so much more that can be done with this great ensemble of characters in this fantastic universe.10/10...George Lucas take heed, this beats your Star Wars Prequels hands down.....",Serenity
414,vincenthetreed,A superburger from TV mastercook Joss Whedon,7,1 January 2006,"This is a spin off from the TV series 'Firefly', not yet on mainstream UK TV. If you like SciFi, if you like Buffy (not just S&M Gellar, but the whole girlie-empowering, advertising-selling Hotdog) you cannot fail to enjoy this. Even if, like me, you've never watched Firefly, the situation and characters are clear enough and strong enough to stand alone as a movie. There are plenty of jokes, fit boys and girls in tights and fights, (battles, even) and quality special effects, so what more could you want?Well - originality: and I don't just mean this is derived from the TV show - after all Joss Whedon created that too - but it's full of romantic, adventure, comedy clichés. Haven't we seen the gallant mavericks save the day/world/universe pretty often before? and the fragile little thing with superhuman martial arts skills? Maybe Joss Whedon partly invented that one, but that was long, long ago and far away, and it's time for a new idea. And the gags: take the slightly less-than-perfect engineer-girlie who is gagging for a shag. An unattractive (relatively, though I would certainly give her more than one) sexually aggressive woman is funny. Ever seen that before? Ado Annie in 'Oklahoma', for instance? And it would be nice if there was some depth, significance, true feeling, those things that great movies often have. This isn't great, but it's excellent entertainment, like a superwhopperburger isn't cordon bleu, but when you're hungry, it looks pretty good.",Serenity
415,jeffrey-46,I had never even *heard* of Firefly but very much enjoyed the movie,8,30 March 2006,"I had never even *heard* of the series ""Firefly"" let alone this movie. It popped up automatically as a suggestion by Netflix. And a good suggestion! This movie has what the latter-day Star Wars movies should have had -- good character development, with shades of gray for all the characters (is he a good guy? A bad guy? the answer to that for all the characters was ""somewhere in between""), good story with depth and creativity and attention to detail, kick-ass special effects (allright, Star Wars had that), great action sequences, etc. But this movie is plot and character driven ahead of anything else -- the action and f/x are just icing. (And that, of course, is what is wrong with the latter day Star Wars movies -- they are f/x driven and plot and characters are secondary. But I digress) I have only a couple of minor complaints, mostly stemming from the somewhat B-movie level of productionChase scenes really seemed to be filmed in slow motion.*every* planet surface looked *exactly* the same, that is to say, a suspiciously large amount like California desert.But seriously, sooper minor quibbles.

Doesn't trust his talent. I'm sorry that he's put this film out, and I wish I could forget what I've seen him do to a setting and story I loved.In trying to make this story ""bigger"" he's made it smaller. Even the physical universe his characters inhabit his dwindled to a teeny fraction of the size it once took up. His revelations of secrets don't hold up, and simply won't wash with what we've already learned about these characters. And sadly, and most ""small"" of all, he's decided to gut the wonderful interactions of an ensemble cast in favor of the tedious, overused cliché of the ""bad, butt-kicking waif"" which you cannot swing a cat without hitting on big screen, small screen, PSP screen, or comic book page.

Not the sci-fi fan I once was, but this really made me yearn for more of that childhood feel-good nostalgia. It suitably taps into the wonderment and imagination that makes us all want to experience adventure on a grand scale. Whedon does a superb job at pacing a witty, leader-to-trailer blast into the outer limits. The acting is deft, backed up by playful banter and sharp-toothed jabs. The visuals are believable, grounded with familiar textures, realistic camera ""movements"" and rough edges, sans cheesy ""futuristic"" production design and campy starship wardrobe.A tight, highly-entertaining triumph that has rightfully earned itself a hallmark spot in the sci-fi hall of fame and Whedon a director's chair in the otherworld pantheon.",Serenity

All characters were well developed and all actors contributed their A games to this film. The film has little bit of everything such as Western, kung Fu, Japanese Anime, we recognized from 70's and 80's throw back space battle scenes from Star wars. The script is very serious and intense, and yet Fillion and Baldwin delivered some what goofiness and humors.

419,cameragod,treats the audience with a degree of respect few Sci Fi achieve,9,25 February 2007,I loved this movie. I think the thing about Serenity is the depth of the characters. A lot of that has to do with the development they got in the Firefly series. But if you listen to the commentary you under stand the detail Whedon when into to give the characters in Serenity a solid believable background. A solid foundation to build the fictional future on. To make the ride feel more real. Another thing I like about Serenity is that it doesn't seem to feel the need to explain everything. I like unanswered questions or only half explained plots and motives so you can fill in the blanks yourself. Once again when you listen to the commentary you can hear just how much though was put into leaving stuff out on purpose. Yes to some degree it a cheesy western in space but it was fun and treats the audience with a degree of respect few Sci Fi achieve.,Serenity
420,jacktreese1,A good movie in its own right.,9,15 November 2005,"Before I write this review, I would just like to point out that I have had very little faith in the sci-fi part of the film industry. Lately, sci-fi has become dull, unoriginal, and pale ever since the Matrix trilogy concluded in 2003 and the Star Wars saga came to a close this past summer.When this movie came out, I initially had no interest in the film at all. I had only seen a few episodes of Firefly, which I'm guessing is the series this is based upon. I thought the film would be about as boring as half of the films Hollywood pumped out this year.Boy, was I wrong.Right from the beginning, I was drawn in. Between the well-crafted special effects and the accomplished acting by Nathan Fillon and Summer Glau, and even the directing job by Joss Whedon (who also wrote), made this a fun ride.Now to the script. Serenity is about Capt. Reynolds evading every move by an alliance leader who wants to take in River Tam, a young beautiful girl with extraordinary powers. As her powers become clearer to Reynold's Serenity crew, the crew questions her power and the alliance.For fun's sake, see Serenity.9/10",Serenity

OH BOY!!!,10,10 October 2005,"First heard about Serenity on Corona Films, and I thought it was some funny pseudo-SF movie made by Hollywood, for teen-agers, some ""Buffy-In-Space"" sort of movie... I was planning on seeing Nochnoi Dozor, as a matter of fact, but I had no time to go to cinema where it premiered, so I chose my local cinema - and Serenity. Well, how can I put it... ? THE MOVIE ROCKS, is that mild enough? Know those trailers where it's all action, and then you'll find it's all the action in the film? Serenity is 100% action (and humor, and character development, and script, and plot, and special effects, and...) from start to finish. A few minutes into the film and WHAM!, and before you're even breathing again, WHAM! a second time... and then STOP. And you're trying to align your bearings when WHAM! again... then cut to the Title sequence (which is thrilling, hilarious, provoking, and very well directed, all at a same time).

It might have been because I haven't seen Firefly, but it was also kind of weird, I mean Reaver's? Really!? This movie though wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is certainly not the best. The only parts of Serenity that I would give like a 9 is the last 45 minutes, but the beginning really wasn't the best. I think the movie would've been a lot better if they made it more like Buffy or Angel. Overall this wasn't the best but I'd probably give it... maybe 6.4 out of 10. If you're thinking of getting this movie try not Netflix, don't get it on DVD.",Serenity
423,MrSharma,"All things considered, a pretty decent film.",8,8 October 2005,"Not a huge fan of the Buffy series and completely impervious and unaware that there even was a television show called ""Firefly"", I viewed this film as a virgin to the apparent talents and abilities of writer-director Joss Whedon in his debut in feature films. ""Serenity"" was better than what I had expected, and with a B Grade cast delivering solid performances as well as mind blowing special effects that I have been missing since the final installment of the Star Wars trilogy, the film was actually quite decent and no doubt achieved what it set out to do. First things first, this film is not aiming to garner any Academy Awards and is not hoping to achieve critical acclaim by those such as Roger Ebert. Instead, it hopes to provide a simple story with a mixture and balance of light-hearted one liners and heart pounding action sequences to effectively transport us into another world; however unrealistic that world may appear to us in this current day and age. With this considered, ""serenity"" delivers all that it promises to be as it transports us into the world and imagination of Joss Whedon for two hours of action. The plot, however, was relatively thin regardless of many Firefly fans dubiously claiming that any complaints whatsoever about this film arise from a lack of comprehension regarding the characters, concepts and story lines inherent in Whedon's original TV show. I beg to differ. The story of a mercenary vessel in a far-away future is by all means an original one and the entire concept of an intergalatic dominating force fits well with the characters we are presented with. Even better is the presentation of a young girl aboard the ""Serenity"", River, who houses some secret power that the Alliance is willing to do absolutely everything to get their hands on. The Alliance, in their desperation, send an assassin to retrieve this girl who conveniently is a kick-ass Kung Fu master of some sort and can subsequently provide us with many decent fight sequences. There's only one problem: Captain Mal of the Serenity and his odd ball crew aren't prepared to yield to the demands of the Alliance and we see a slug fest occur between the key controllers of both sides. That slug fest is the film.As can be seen, the plot is a simple one and sets us up for some great action and special effects as well as realistic CGI. That's exactly the problem though. Throughout the film, the presentation of characters and situations seems to be a tool used merely to provide action instead of a tool to further the story and make us care more about what we're looking at on the big screen. It seems like Joss Whedon has said to himself ""Hmmm, I want a big action scene in a bar where a young girl kicks ass. How can I do this? Why don't I create a young girl character who can kick ass? And then, why don't I have her walk in a bar? Perfect!"" And there's the film. To me, this was one of the fundamental problems with the film and it permeated the entire picture. However, who cares about that when you've got guns!!! No criticisms can be made on the acting and the special effects, and Whedon illustrates his abilities as a writer and director by establishing characters that we actually care about and subsequently plunging these characters into worlds that we can only dream of. But then again, it's all been done before. --Space ships battling one another in space (Star Wars) --Weird planets with weird creatures (Star Wars) --Better Kung Fu fighting sequences (The Matrix) As a result, I walked out of the theatre satisfied with my two hours but simultaneously realising that I had seen everything in the picture before; particularly in Star Wars which seems to be a permeating influence throughout Serenity itself. The film brought nothing special to me as a viewer and as a critical observer of film. Ultimately, ""Serenity"" is a fun ride of humour, action and suspense. But if you're looking for humour, action and suspense done in a diabolical and ""medium-altering"" way then this film will not win you over. Instead, if you're prepared to enter the theatre with an open mind and an understanding of what this film intends to do then you will no doubt leave the film arena with a knowing that your money was well spent and that, for two hours, you were immersed in worlds far distant from your own. All things considered, a pretty fun ride.",Serenity

The crew of Serenity have another trouble brought upon this time everyone being reluctant to go, it's the journey that brings them to their human beliefs. Packed with an amazing score, fantastic directing, brilliant story and menacing villain.

425,Nh3,Why was this in the big screen?,1,14 November 2005,"When I saw the actor's names appearing one by one in the screen while the movie was going on I started to feel the telefilm smell of this horror. The hyper-saturation of low-budget computer made effects confirmed the suspicion. Finally when boring discussions with a bad punchline started it vaguely reminded me of the style of a Buffy chapter. I was watching a Joss Whedon production!! OK, I knew before I attended cinema but I didn't expect it to be THAT bad. This is the first time in my life that I leave the cinema before the movie ends and I wasn't the only one. Seems like ""serenity"" was a show on TV and that its die-hard fans are raising the rating to the level of absurdity.",Serenity
426,surferchicky92,$11.50 for a ticket very well spent!!!,10,8 October 2005,"For me, the stand out performances were Nathan Fillion as Mal, Summer Glau as River, and Jewel Staite as Kaylee. They just seemed so much like people that you pass on the street everyday they were that real.I happen to think that Nathan Fillion is very cute, his accent was probably the hottest thing about him, not that everything else wasn't bad. He isn't your typical action hero, but that's what I really liked about him. There seemed to be a small bit of vulnerability in him that slowly but surely made it's way up to the surface. Plus, he was just amazingly funny. Especially in this one scene that I won't give away because that wouldn't be good. Plus the chemistry between him and Morenna Baccarin as Inara is so great beyond words.Summer Glau's fight scenes are probably some of he greatest fight scenes in about, well, ever. Her experience as a ballerina probably helped a lot. I think the hilarious thing is that if you just glanced at her without knowing her, you'd think she wouldn't harm a fly. Plus, her performance wasn't too over the top, but it wasn't too low key. It was the perfect place in between.Jewel Statie as Kaylee reminded me of someone just like her, who secretly pines for the really handsome guy, the guy and was just a little clumsy, me. She was the character I could relate to the most out of all. She was funny, real, and a lot of fun to watch. That's why I was rooting for her through out the entire movie.My final thoughts, and I promise I'll shut my trap. This is probably going to be the next big thing for Sci-Fi movies, a la Star Wars. I can't wait to see what all the actor's in this movie are going to do next, cause judging from what I saw, they've got a lot of good things coming for them. And finally, I'm hoping to god they make a sequel. Peace out:)",Serenity
427,jason_parallel,A kick-butt sci-fi movie,8,12 February 2006,"First off, I have to clarify that I am not a big fan of Joss Whedon's other projects. Both Buffy and Angel were probably two of the worst t.v. shows I had ever had the displeasure of watching, and I could never understand why those shows had such a huge cult following. So when a friend suggested that I borrow his copies of Firefly and Serenity, I had my doubts. I was expecting more teeny-pop-culture crap from this one.But I gotta say that Serenity is probably one of the best sci-fi movies that I have seen in years. The t.v. series was great, but the movie took that universe to a whole new level. The f/x were outstanding, the acting was great, and the plot was intriguing. I hope that Mr. Whedon attempts to make two more; this flick was how the last three Star Wars movies should have been made! Very well done!",Serenity
428,Aldaron,"An absolute must-see, whether you're a Firefly fan or not...",10,2 October 2005,"I don't want to give too much away, so my review won't be a blow-by-blow description of the film. Suffice to say that the movie is completely familiar for fans of the Firefly series, but contains enough exposition and background to allow non-fans to watch and enjoy the film as simple great sci-fi (space opera?).For the non-Firefly fans: the back story is set up nicely, showing what happened prior to the beginning of the series, then skipping forward to the present. The characters' personalities are quickly established, and the film moves quickly into demonstrating the abilities (and scariness!) of the bad guys (of all kinds).For the Firefly fans: well, you won't be disappointed! Beginning with flashbacks to before the series, it quickly gets going with some action and a reminder of just why everyone is scared of the Reavers. Without giving too much away, you'll learn a lot more about River's background, and can look forward to two hours of action, drama, tragedy and humour in the finest Firefly style.Enjoy!",Serenity
429,rsilverst,8 out of 10? I just don't get it...,2,7 February 2006,"I like most movies I see. I even like movies that other people hate. There must be something wrong with me. Or else, maybe the 34,000 people who averaged 8/10 on this movie must all be Firefly fans. I've only watched one episode of the series, which my friends told me was ""must see"". I hated the episode. They insisted that ""that was just a bad episode - you should really see the movie - it's much better!"".So I did. And it wasn't. I don't get it. Honestly. And it's not that I don't like sci-fi. Star Trek Next Generation was one of my favorite shows of all time, and I thought that ""First Contact"" was a great movie. And I like the new Battlestar Galactica too. But this movie is so not-compelling. The plot is virtually non-existent. The acting poor. And the special effects dull.Please tell me you're all just devoted Firefly fans, and that you'd watch anything with these characters. Don't tell me that you really thought this movie was 8/10 stars. Come on! Movies that have a similar rating on the IMDb list included: ""The Green Mile"", ""The Graduate"", ""Glory"", ""Platoon"", ""Gone With The Wind"", and ""Amores Perros"". You cannot seriously tell me that ""Serenity"" is on par with these movies! Even ""Princess Bride"", one of the greatest films of all time, was only an 8.1/10 stars!!!

Even emotionally disturbing scenes can be a kind of stimulation.""Serenity"" covers the entire spectrum; adventure, thrills, laughs, sadness and sexual tension. It's quite the roller coaster ride.

Fans of ""Firefly"" will find themselves challenged by a slightly different slant and perspective from the movie, also a Whedon trademark: catering to and simultaneously challenging his fans.As with all of Whedon's works, he'll make you laugh, he'll make you cheer, he'll have you on the edge of the seat and he'll break your heart.If you are a ""Firefly"" fan I would strongly suggest seeing the movie soon (I went to the first matinée at the AMC 42nd Street in Manhattan) to avoid spoilers.",Serenity
432,EuroMaverick,Very nice package but light what's inside,5,15 August 2006,"*** Contains a lot of spoilers - don't read if you have not seen the movie yet ! *** I saw this movie without any knowledge of the series or whatsoever - I didn't even know there was a series around it. So, basically, my viewing was as ""virgin"" as it could get.Overall, this movie has a very nice package: the camera-work is excellent, as is the editing, the music, and everything that comes with it. The whole world that is created, could be very realistic. The special effects are very well done and, thanks God, are there to support the movie (not like many other movies *are* the movie). In general, a very nice package absolutely worth looking at - much better than your average movie.However, apart of that, the movies is full of clichés and has a very poor and messy plot. It could be me, but it took me 15 minutes to understand more or less what it going on and there are far too many assumptions or plot changes that you just need to accept or try to understand as a viewer. For me, that seriously brings down a movie.And then the clichés... Boy, it looks like every great SF movies comes around and get mixed with other terrible clichés that all end in a happy, predictable end (yech) ! Over the top ? Hey, our big boy gets shot in the leg by an arrow, and (being a hero), pulls out the arrow and walks on. The captain struggles with his demons of the past. Our team gets stuck in a hopeless fight and gets saved at the very end while our hero fights a final fight against the bad guy (which is won by our hero, of course). Their friends get killed by the bad guys, but the leader is found alive, just to be able to speak a couple of final words before he dies in the arms of his friends. Yawn...Ahd then the homages to other movies (at least that's what I think it is, although I'm not sure it was intended like that): a ""car"" race on the surface of a planet (Star Wars), a girls that fights 10 man at the same time with wonderful moves (The Matrix), Zombies that come to get you (a couple of hundred other movies, but reminded me a lot of ""28 days later"" here), a fight in a bar on an outer planet (hey, Star Wars again !), the bad guy that sees the cause of our hero is a good one and changes his mind (a couple of thousand other movies), and so on, and so on...It is really kind of a shame, since this movie could have been *much* better if more attention was given to all this.Overall: a very nice package but with very light content.",Serenity

It didn't take long after seeing the film though that I tracked down the series and am now on my third box of, sadly, the one and only season as I have worn my other discs out. This movie introduced me to the Firefly universe and I ache that that universe ended with the movie. Although in the last decade there were some graphic novels added, it's still not nearly enough. The characters, the stories, the sincerity, the action, the heart, was all so original despite it feeling so familiar. I am an admitted hard-core Sci-Fi fan. I rank Serenity/Firefly as my favorite Sci-Fi movie/series of all time. Period. The only solace I have to not seeing any new stories is that I re-watch the series and movie often. It's such a joy.

Saw the pre-release in May that even was without all effects and music and it was still good. Because we watched the show, there were lots of extremely tense moments but the best part was that if someone hadn't seen the show, they'd be able to enjoy a romping space western too. The movie is consistent with it's own story line and details. There are several unexpected events that leave you reeling in your seat. The characters are what make this movie worth watching. As for myself.. well.. I'll be there opening night to see the finished product. Adam Baldwin is used heavily as a marketing tool on this film and while he is his always excellent self, his part in the movie was smaller than originally anticipated.",Serenity
436,pathighgate,An A movie that thinks its a B movie,6,13 October 2005,"When a good movie thinks it's a ""b"" movie.As a whole, Serenity is a solid sci-fi picture with a good deal of entertainment value.The film is not without its drawbacks: The overall plot has been done before (well meaning but flawed hero races against time and insurmountable odds to broadcast 'the truth' regarding some government conspiracy or secret), and the acting is more often miss then hit (Gina Torres is a particularly bad offender; half of her time on screen, she seems to be distracted by things completely unrelated to the movie). The special effects are competent but come across as average compared with what we've seen done in other modern sci-fi pictures.However, the above mentioned drawbacks can be forgiven due to some rather exceptional things about this movie, found in acting, in style and in the lesser plot points in the script.Chiwetel Ejiofor does a wonderful job in his role as a nameless government agent, taking an already fascinating and unique character and masterfully adding quite a few subtleties giving it a remarkable amount of depth. It's seems that ""the operative"" was written as the ultimate, flawless stoic: A man who acknowledges that he himself is a monster who sins in order to help foster a world without sin. Yet contained in Ejiofor's performance are nuances that extend the character out to points beyond what the script appeared to have called for. Despite the dialog the film has him recite, ""The operative"" is not perfect, and Ejiofor lets us know the operative is aware of this. As the film progresses we start to see that included with the soft-spoken, meticulous, intelligent and unrepentant package is a man coming to terms with a deeply disturbing hypocrisy.The film leaves us thinking that the operative walks off to throw himself on his sword, though it's likely filmmakers left his fate unknown in the hopes of bringing him back in a sequel. Considering the quality of his character and Ejiofor's performance, this isn't a bad thing.The overall style of the film is also a delight. Granted, some of the CGI looks like, well, CGI, and the movement of spacecraft at times comes off as unnatural and improbable. But otherwise the look is fantastic. We don't see the clean, uncluttered aesthetic of Star Trek nor the grimy and dark look of The Matrix. Instead, we are given something that suggests a functional, lived-in look that upon reflection comes off as very plausible. Moreover, this approach to set design manages to be inventive and enjoyable without being distracting.Avid moviegoers will be familiar with the ending, leaving it somewhat anti-climatic. Due to the way it's presented, there is little question that the recording explaining what happened on Miranda is going to get out. What saves this movie isn't the conclusion, however; it's the path the film takes to reach that conclusion. The way the picture slowly reveals things such as the root cause of River's psychosis or the effects of the atmospheric tampering during the terraform process.Ultimately, however, the movie ends up failing due to an unfortunate treatment of the film. In ""b"" movies; (low budget, bad actors, ridiculous plots), it's common for a films producers to be aware that they are, in fact, making a crummy movie. In order to give the film some entertainment value, they'll ""spice-up"" the work by littering the dialog with campy cornball humor. With a bad movie, this sort of tongue-in-cheek brand of humor typically works, making the film more entertaining then it would be without the screwy humor.Serenity has a generous helping of this particular brand of camp. The problem is, Serenity isn't a 'B' movie. By all rights, with its budget and the vast talent resources behind the production of this work, Serinity is an A caliber film. Had they left out the camp, it could have easily become a sci-fi classic.",Serenity

A mix of science fiction, western and horror, it does require the suspension of belief and looking past any attempt for a movie to take itself seriously.Firefly/Serenity is for fun. Yes there are the comparison with the overreaching Alliance authority vs. the independents, but this is just he premise. The point of the movie is to have fun and enjoy.The character are not the stereotypes of the very bad action and science fiction movies of the last 10 years, and the action is totally enjoyable (and unbelievable). Malcom Reynalds displays the more typical traits of someone that is not sure of what they are going to do next, or even should do next. He's not hero or anti-hero, just hacking his way along until he can figure something out. He doesn't until he is left with no choice.THe quips are funny, I actually heard laughter in the theater, something rare even for comedies these days. The crew is close, but in the snide way some friends and associates usually are. They won't show if they care and aren't really sure themselves until tested.Forget the hype, this is the best movie experience you will have this year, if not in the last several years.If you are fortunate to be a fan of the Firefly series, then this will be movie event to remember for quite a while.",Serenity

440,hhhrahulhhh,A nice blend of many old science fiction concepts,7,5 January 2014,"I have yet seen the firefly series. But now I'm gonna. What a refreshing angle this movie has given to a space sci-fi foray.Truthfully, I was a bit jaded from the Battlestar Galactica season 3 disaster and when this movie began I thought here we go again. But now it seems that the shorter length version is probably better suited to such storytelling. I am sure the series would probably go more into the depth of this world and seeing that it's so highly rated it is probably top priority in my watch-list. Shame there's only one season to look forward to.SPOILERS!Anyways onto the storyline. The concept is easy enough to think of. Earth's on for a disaster, mankind has to relocate and inhabit another solar system, colonization, political strife, inevitable failure of socialistic principles, evil empire and a small band of rebels. Most of the aspects to the story have been clichéd parts of many old sci-fis. From the mental programming of the superhuman weapon, the evil alliance (The Empire anyone?), small band of under the radar rebels, mindless creatures formed as a result of human experiment (Not flesh eating zombies again!!) each concept has been explored in a better manner in many other flicks. So I'm taking a couple of points off for that.What struck me as original were the bits of detail and new science jargon thrown around. ""Terra forming"" what a concept, I'm not sure what they are calling any attempts at establishing bases on the moon but this should be it. Also really cool was the concept that removing violence from human beings removes their basic instinct to survive. Don't get me wrong as I do not want to endorse the continuance of violence, what struck me as pretty interesting here is that influencing any artificial change in our bodies (which is not the result of evolution) may result in unimaginable side effects. A chemical which stops the basic human instinct of aggression simply turns off the switch for survival. Another piece of tidbit that I enjoyed was the beginning scene where the kids were fiddling with touchscreens while their teacher was lecturing. As this movie is dated 2005 this vision seems to be eerily foresighted in its prophecy of the rise of touch devices.For the part of the actors, they did justify their characters and roles, though the character themselves were a bit bland and clichéd. Nathan Fillian did a great job with his role (Reminds me of Charlie Sheen). Summer Glau at times did good work with her character. Mal (Fillian) and River (Glau) were always going to be the defining character for the movie and though Mal was a well written character, I felt River as a character had a confused portrayal. Anyways Glau did manage to pull forward a bit of the creepy factor which her character should have done in abundance. The rest of the crew did not have as significant parts to the storyline and were droll at times so another point off for that.Looking forward to watching the series which seems to be excellent by the description. Hope it doesn't disappoint.",Serenity

We're not children, we're all in our late twenties to late fifties!! We've thought that Joss Whedon was a genius forever. Now we KNOW that he is one. I wouldn't dare talk about the movie ""Serenity"". All must make up their own minds, I am only here to say that it has changed my way of thinking about SciFi and Outer Space movies. They can be beautiful and wonderful, and engaging, and exciting without alien creatures in them. Of course, some of the characters in ""Serenity"" were a bit ""strange"", but not one alien creature.Once was just not enough. Neither was three times!! I am sure that all three of my adult children and I, will see this movie over and over again. Then we'll buy the DVD when it is available. My daughter has the ""Firefly"" DVDs, and the ""Serenity"" script book, (also all of the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" DVDs). The comics, all of it.We don't play when it comes to Joss Whedon!! These cast members, the ""Firefly"" regulars are so perfect as the stars of this movie, we waited on pins and needles until the movie opened, we're ""Browncoats"", we're ""Fillionaires"", but most of all we're ""Whedonites""!! We hope that everybody in their right mind goes to see this movie. There just has to be a second and a third movie to thrill and chill us. Don't think that I am addle pated or anything, I enjoyed lots of other movies, and I really have enjoyed these actors in other things.Including Gina Torres in Alias, Cleopatra 2525, Xena, and Matrix, (and even in Angel)!! I loved Ron Glass in Barney Miller!! Adam Baldwin has always been one of my favorites, and I always knew he wasn't one of ""the brothers"" too. Nathan Fillion first caught my eye in ""Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place"", but I forgave him for that, now.

We want to see so much more of you!! In anything, but especially in space. Please Mr. Whedon, fight, fight fight for more ""Serenity"" movies. People go and see why we're so passionate about this movie, these people, that ship, and the t.v. show too, (Still).*Oh, and buy the ""Serenity"" comics, too, all three of them!! They are great reading, and they bridge the t.v. show with the Movie. (p.s. I love those Vampire Slayer ""Fray"" comics so very much! All of Joss' comics are visual masterpieces!!

442,gri666,"Great movie, especially for people who liked the Firefly series",10,30 March 2017,"This is a good space adventure movie. The world in which this movie takes place is a very interesting world, somewhat akin to Star Wars. An evil empire, renegade protagonists on the run from authorities. The different settings and characters explored in this movie complement each other like in any good sci-fi, reminding us we're a product of our environment and there's no absolute truth and no good or bad people. This is exactly what was great about the original series, and this movie explores many more parts of this world and provides explanations for its riddles.Character development lacks a little bit in my opinion, as the transition from reclusive survivor to hero is a little too rushed. But there are many characters and many of them evolve in interesting ways.If it was a standalone movie I think I'd rate it 8 or 9, but for a fan of the original series it was such a great experience to go back to the characters and their world, so I give it 10 stars.As a side note, I believe it's OK to watch the movie before the series if you can't commit to the series before seeing what they're about in a focused 2 hour session. But better watch the series first.",Serenity
443,lvcambot-2,A clear example of Internet Ratings gone wrong.,1,4 August 2006,"Firefly was rightly canceled by Fox TV years ago. Serenity (The Movie) was created based on series creator Joss Whedon's ego and a small yet Internet Activist User base.These users corrupted the Internet rating systems to get their Infantile project back on the Screen. Special interest groups sprang up asking for donations to do what was necessary to bring this horrible (failed) program back on the air.One of the best sources of Movie information on the Internet IMDb was suckered in and probably even pandered to this small but very vocal and out right hostile group. They broke every rule and as a result corrupted the on-line tools that the every day ""Joe"" uses to pick his Friday night movie experience.Instead of going back to the drawing board and rewriting the IMDb rating system to FIX this corruption.. IMDb went right along with it. Taking away any credibility IMDb ever had in picking a good movie from a bad one.IMDb also pandered to the few hostile Groups that hyped ""Firefly and Serenity"".The result was many people wasting hear earned money on this terrible TV DVD set as well as DVD movie. These poor folks were like lambs to the saluter. Buying a clearly over hyped ""Science Fantasy"" Comic book yarn that appeals to a very narrow group. Thousand of thousands of these DVD sets were bought under false ratings and over whelming 10+++ comments.Users that were out spoken about how bad the canceled series was were labeled ""Trolls"" and eventually deleted from the system. The hundreds of fanatical users (and their aliases) wreaked havoc every chance they got to manipulate the loose IMDb system.IMDb/Amazon instead of taking the high road.. decided to let their system be contaminated. This contamination is still here today.The long term effects of Firefly and Serenity has really hurt what could have been one of the best Movie services on the Internet.I personally believe that the damage is one. The only chance IMDb has is to be bought out and bring in a management that not only understands movies.. but also understands the dark side on Internet Marketing.I believe a better Movie Database system will take advantage of IMDb weaknesses and bury them.",Serenity
444,dplante-26699,Review of Just One Character,10,10 March 2017,"NO SPOILERSThere have been LOTS of reviews of Serenity, and rather than sing the same praises as others, I want to single out one performance that is indicative of how this film reached far above the lofty bar to which it would be held.Like Kevin Spacey's John Doe in ""Se7en"" and Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh in ""No Country for Old Men"", Chiwetel Ejiofor's Operative was an incredibly complex, multi-dimensional, and truly terrifying villain. Rarely does one see a characterization as chilling as his (like Doe and Chigurh). And that, in and of itself, would make for a spectacular role. But Mr. Ejiofor actually brought a level of humanity and sympathy to a character that would otherwise seem irredeemable. His performance was stellar. An incredible takeaway from a film full of moments that all exceeded expectations and performances that shined! As others may have recommended, watch the entire ""Firefly"" series first to get the full background for the story. Then settle back for an amazing final act with ""Serenity"".",Serenity
445,lbk99-geo,Best Movie I've seen in a long time!,10,8 October 2005,"Serenity is the best movie I've seen in quite awhile. It has plenty of action, but unlike a lot of other science fiction oriented movies it also has *A story*. Seems like someone finally realized that special effects alone do not make for a great movie. The movie is based on the prematurely canceled show ""Firefly"", but is easy to watch and follow without ever having seen Firefly. The actors are relatively unknown, but do a good job, helped along by some well written and witty dialog. I read Ebert's review of this beforehand, and while I do not always agree with him, I have to say he was right on the money this time. The movie works on just about every level, and I have already seen it twice, something I rarely bother to do these days.Unfortunately, it is doing fair at best in the box-office, likely due to a lack of aggressive marketing. If you have not seen it yet, go soon, because this is not one you want to wait until the DVD for!",Serenity
446,wadetalon,This is what cinema is about 'Lucas learn from this will you',10,9 October 2005,"I'm sorry if I'm stepping on toes here by saying this but, It took George Lucas over two decades to come up with his dire attempts at cashing in with 'THE PREQUELS' and it took Joss Whedon about two years to bury Lucas's attempts at Sci-Fi with not only an excellent piece of Science fiction but a brilliant piece of story telling that appeals to lovers of all types of movie genre. This Movie doesn't let up once i was on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Whedon just kept me entertained the whole way through. This may have been set in the distant future in a far off universe but, You feel for these characters each portrayed brilliantly in the own ways by each actor.Even the new comers to this tale blended in with the usual crew who had moved from small to big screen with ease. And it was sad to have to see some of these characters leave in the end, But again with this Whedon had the viewers second guessing who will make it through this?. Absolute Brilliance go see this Movie and tell everyone you know to go see this movie it deserves a sequel..",Serenity
447,grin,Unfortunately different from the series,7,24 December 2005,"I accept that it is hard to make a movie, and I can guess a studio may press something the creator/writer does not like, but still, this move performed well below my expectations. I do not know whose fault it is, nor do I really care.To be honest: I have never heard about Firefly or Serenity, it was mentioned somewhere, so I borrowed the series from a friend and watched it, thinking I better know the story in the movie. I liked it (Firefly, the series, and especially since it was the DVD which contained all the episodes) very much, but it is not our topic here; so after watching the abruptly canceled series I guessed that the people behind it knew it was over, and they would have created a mighty, finishing final episode for the movie, with full of everything they would have liked to tell but cannot. I expected a good story, good acting and creative looks.Now, let's talk about this movie. It is full of actions, full of mighty scenes, fights, lots of beautifully animated flying whatevers. The fighting is remarkable, especially the martial arts parts. But the story is weak, and short, and mostly consists filling dialogs between the fights. I missed the story most, and felt that fighting have stolen the time from it. (Granted, they shared _some_ of the secrets people were waiting for, but even that felt a bit weak to me.) I know that the actors can act, since they did in the series, so I guess they were asked not to. I have missed the personalities: the members communicate almost none, nothing personal, they have no emotional relations, bonds, nothing; they just seem to do their task. To be fair they had no time to show emotions since most of the time someone was fighting with someone else. The beauty of the personalities, and their personal problems and emotional fights in the series were missing in the movie.The visuals were good. I like good CGI, but I like it best when it does not show, or when it is creatively done to _look_ like it was not CGI. I felt most (space) scenes were packed with ""objects"", everything's moving, shooting, making lights or fire, but I was missing the feeling that it is ""real"". Again, if you've seen the series it was evident that most of its scenes were not in space, were not in very high-tech environment either, which made it look more natural, more believable. Serenity is much more like that everyday sci-fi movie: lots of high-tech environments, lots of space scenes... but then again I have seen lots of everyday sci-fi movies and I was expecting not to see another one, but something more special, something more...personal, more believable, more human.Yeah, granted, I prefer story to fighting and visuals (while I'd choose to have all of them if possible), don't need to tell me. If you liked the Firefly series because it was different then you may not like this movie so much. Don't misunderstood: the movie is an above average sci-fi action movie. It is good, but it is not THAT good. Worths a look, but I believe one is enough.",Serenity
448,Robert S-3,"Boring and dumb if you aren't ""Firefly"" TV series fan",2,11 November 2009,"I love SCIENCE-fiction, but this movie has nothing to do with SCIENCE. This is a kind of space western action movie set in the distant future, nothing to do with realism and science. Everything here is unbelievably dumb.I haven't watch the original Firefly TV series, so maybe this is the problem - by watching characters only in the movie, you simply don't care about them - they seem to be just a bunch of gang members (or maybe cowboys?)- dumb and violent. You wonder how such duds would be able to pilot a spacecraft? But maybe this is possible in a universe where laws of physics seem to be very different from our world - ex. a spacecraft crash isn't more violent than a bicycle crash - just a fews bruises... If you liked ""Armageddon"" and ""Space Cowboys"", you will probably like it.If you are a fan of ""Space Odyssey 2001"" and ""Solaris"", you should avoid it.Extremely overrated due to ""TV series fan effect""",Serenity
449,Mike Carroll,Shiny!,10,24 August 2005,"Go and see Serenity! It is a seriously excellent movie - absolutely flawless. It's been a long time since I last saw a movie that had me on the edge of my seat like this one did! It's funny, thrilling, scary, engaging... This is the stuff of which good movies are made! The writing, direction, acting, visual effects, audio and - well, basically everything else - are truly top-notch: Joss Whedon should be very proud of himself.Firefly - the show that was prematurely cancelled - was always head-and-shoulders above any other TV science fiction, and now the movie version has surpassed even that. Even if you don't consider yourself to be a Joss Whedon fan, I'm sure you'll love Serenity!",Serenity
450,daniel_pryor,This movie is awesome! I can't believe the last 3 pages are bad reviews!,9,8 October 2005,"About 53 of the now 57 pages are people raving about how good the movie is, that should tell you something right there! I have no idea why there is an obvious slander war about the last 3 pages against this movie. And I can see someone maybe giving this movie like a 5 or 6 if they are not fans of the TV show, but come on guys, a ""1"", gee, that low of a score is reserved for true dogs like ""From Justin to Kelly"" and ""Glitter""! LOL! If you're not a sci-fi fan don't see this movie. If you're a sci-fi fan but haven't seen the TV series then rent the DVDs first, then see the movie, you'll definitely understand more about the characters, etc. The show was only canceled because FOX didn't allow it to develop enough, thankfully the SCI-FI channel had enough sense to FINALLY grab it, but after it was canceled. I sincerely hope the Sci-Fi channel will bring it back, but I have to say that the movie version was far superior in every way to the TV show.Now some fans are complaining because main characters were killed off almost without warning, but hey, I think that added realism to the story, I like it when any of them has a chance of dying, of course American audiences as a whole hate that sort of thing.I personally think this movie is great, but I can only give it a 9 out of 10, it has a few editing missteps here and there and towards the end the movies becomes somewhat predictable and formulated, but it was highly entertaining overall and keep my interested throughout the picture. I just wish the TV show could have been as high-budget as this movie. I have no problems putting this movie in the same category of greatness of the Star Wars, Star Trek, and other sci-fi favorites of mine, I can't wait until it comes out on DVD!",Serenity
451,pekka-raninen-1,Tries to be everything,2,27 July 2019,"This movie has a promising start, but then it just flops. It tries to be everything for every viewer, and contains all the possible cliches of westerns, scifi movies and series. I won't begin listing all of those. If you've watched films for over 40 yrs, like I have, you'll be bored to death, and the only pleasure is writing down which scene is from which film every 5 minutes or even less.Same goes to music. And the actors are B/C class, or at least the director is. Sorry, but don't waste your time with this garbage, really.",Serenity
452,sasya,What a roller coaster ride!,9,21 September 2005,"This movie is intense. The action, the emotions, the plot development, the effects, the acting - this movie is full to the brim and is guaranteed to sweep you off your feet. You'll laugh out loud, you'll cry, you'll hold your breath, you'll sit quietly in astonishment. The audience in the cinema where I watched Serenity (totally packed) were by turns completely still and in uproar. What a great experience!Contrary to most science fiction drivel, it actually has real people you quickly relate to going through actual character development, a story worth telling and the use of special effects and action in the service of the plot - not vice versa. Don't miss this - guaranteed a place among science fiction classics!",Serenity
453,PrincessConsuelaBananahammock,Best movie I've seen in years,10,20 October 2005,"Serenity is a typical Joss Whedon product: high quality. Unlike many other movies that seem to rely on flashy special effects/CGI and make the story come secondary, Serenity is character-driven so that the story comes first and the special effects/CGI only serve to enhance the story. Although Serenity continues on from where the Firefly series left off, it's not necessary to watch the TV series in order to enjoy the movie. Having said that, it would make watching Serenity much better if you saw Firefly first, as you'd know the characters better and understand everything that they've gone through before the movie begins. Serenity is definitely one of those movies that requires multiple viewings, as there is so much going on that it's almost impossible to catch it all the first time.",Serenity
454,lymond01,"Never saw Firefly, just bought the DVDs for Serenity and Firefly",10,11 January 2006,"I have a friend at work who kept harping on how people were trying to keep Firefly going. I figured it was another Farscape or Andromeda so I sort of yawned through his preaching. He finally loaned my his copy of Serenity. If the series was anything like the movie, how the heck did it get cancelled when tripe like Andromeda and Farscape stay on? That was one of the best space movies I've ever seen. Characters, humor, action, drama, and good lord the TIMING of everything was perfect. If all movies could be half as good as this one...Very impressed. Very unfortunate this will be the last we see of those characters.",Serenity

I am a big sci-fi fan and was very disappointed with the recent star war movies and couldn't believe all the hype and money they generated, well I could but isn't it just amazing for a series that was so poor and could have been so much better, you got the feeling that everyone was just going through the motions. Back to Serenity, now here we have an example of how it should have been done, I have never seen 'Firefly' and was unsure of what to expect with only the review of 'jmoffitt' to tempt me to go see it. I agree with the view that this movie continues from where the original 'Star Wars' left off. I have waited a long time for a really good Sci-Fi but it was worth it. A must see movie, you will not be disappointed.",Serenity
456,moviewatcher417,What movies should be like...,10,3 October 2005,"These days a lot of movies you just watch, kill the time and then leave the theater. Serenity took that a step further when I saw it. It took in the audience in a way that I haven't seen in a while. The audience laughed at all the jokes (and there were a lot of them), jumped at the scary parts and were shocked at the surprises. At the end of the movie, there was an applause. The only other movie that I've seen this happen for this year was Batman Begins. Star Wars Episode III did not produce this kind of reaction. Serenity had good special effects, but it also had an engaging story and rich characters that make you care about what happens to them. Bottom line: This movie is a real treat for anyone, not just fans of the show or Sci-Fi buffs.",Serenity
457,margetwormwood,Great Ending to a ........,8,8 February 2011,"I'm gonna assume that the majority of people who saw this movie were fans of the show. As a stand alone film it doesn't really work...but...it wasn't made as such. Serenity was made to cap off what was an amazing series that was cancelled well before its time.Many times TV shows have ended with a film. Many times, they were terrible. But the Firefly series was done justice with this one. It tied up all loose ends and made you feel comfortable - even though you know it was the end of the series.As a stand alone film - it's not worth watching. I would suggest watching the series first to fully enjoy it at what it's worth - a perfect ending.",Serenity
458,gibat51,What was that?????,1,24 July 2006,"Just finished seeing the movie on TV and still wondering what it was all about. Utter garbage! That movies like this can be made for the big screen is an insult to the industry, considering that many good scripts never get a chance. This film should be used in film schools as an example of things to avoid when making a film- bad script, bad acting, bad editing, horrendous continuity, cheap and senseless stunts,terrible storyline....need I go on? I had never seen Firefly on TV- this movie made sure that I will never watch it. I have seen low-budget science-fiction that is way better than this trash.To those who loved it- get a life!!!",Serenity
459,unklechunkle,An action-packed and wonderfully crafted epic conclusion to Firefly,10,18 July 2013,"I started watching Firefly about 9 months ago and I was surprised by the quality of its dialogue, characters and stories; it is an incredibly unique and original vision for the future of the human race, blending space opera, science fiction, western, crime, romance and comedic elements. Soon after finishing Objects in Space, I watched Serenity for the first time but was unsure as to whether it loved up to the series. Upon multiple viewings though, I totally disagree with my initial reaction and credit Serenity as not only one of my favourite SF films, but one of my favourite films ever.Starting some time after Firefly, Serenity follows the exploits of Mal Reynolds and his crew as they try to keep living, and flying, in the outer regions of the Verse, denying control of the Alliance. One of their number however, River Tam, is being hunted down by the Alliance after she escaped from a facility where mind altering drugs converted people into assassins. An agent simply known as The Operative, played wonderfully by Chiwetel Ejiofor, races to find Serenity before its crew discover the truth about River, and the secrets locked away in her mind.Serenity brings many elements to the table that made Firefly so enjoyable. Each of the characters are so well written and, despite their flaws, try to make their way in the Verse; they are all so well likable and real too. For a theatrical debut from Joss Whedon, this is an incredibly confident and visually striking piece of work which, whilst retaining it's television roots, does not feel out of place on the big screen and in fact brings a lot to the universe and mythology of Firefly.Serenity will go down in history for its wonderfully constructed plot, popular characters, witty dialogue, striking visual effects and the fast-paced, action-packed and enjoyable 2 hour ride it takes you on...There's no place I can be, since I found Serenity!",Serenity
460,werdnahall,Not baaad bad,6,27 February 2010,"Saw this after reading a few glowing reviews. I take it it's a bit of a geek-insider fan favorite. I have no problem with that, it just wasn't exactly what I was expecting. Apparently it derives from a TV show called Firefly, and essentially that's what it feels like: a longer, more violent, TV episode. The writing was pretty good, probably its strongest point. The acting and camera-work, though, felt more TV-level; the special effects, as well, just a bit above what I'd expect from the sci-fi channel (though I thought the fighting scenes were rather well done). Overall not too bad, just don't go into it with the same inflated expectations I did.",Serenity
461,freddythreepwood,Not as good as the series,6,23 April 2009,"Being a big fan of the series, I came away disappointed from viewing the movie. The innovation that hallmarked the series was simply missing from the movie.The characters did a great job holding up their roles. The action was in tune with my expectations, and so were the special effects. It moved at a fair clip, and there was always something happening, although sometimes a little disjointed, to hold the viewer's attention. The fight sequences can rank with some of the best martial arts movies out there, and the attention to detail was immediately noticeable.With all this going for the movie, I was surprised to find myself disappointed after the viewing. I think it was simply due to the fact that the storyline was extremely simplistic and simply did not match the caliber of the production of the movie. It just didn't seem worth all the trouble to the Alliance to cover up what turns out to be the ""secret"" in the movie, nor worth all the trouble to the crew of the Serenity to unmask this secret. The movie could have definitely been more intricately plotted, as anyone having watched the Firefly series will agree.I do hope they make a few more of these movies, as the producers seem to have retained all the other components (besides creative storytelling) that made the series such smashing fun. The potential to regain the grand adventure of the high-flying series is definitely there - and it would be criminal to leave it untapped.",Serenity
462,jamiepercival,Run,1,5 February 2013,"""Facepalm"" So I just watched Serenity and that's two hours of my life i'm not getting back.A word of advice to people reading this never watch this film ever if you happen to see it in a shop just walk past it like it never existed that's what I wish I did but it's to late I can't unsee what has been seen but there's still hope for you so listen to me Im just trying to protect you from this awful film. If I was given a choice to watch this film or be stabbed in the eyes while being forced to listen to the black veil brides I would rather take option two. Seriously! It's my own fault for watching this my brother told me to stay clear of this but I didn't listen now Im scared to watch film's ever again. It will never be the same for me now so avoid this film or pay the ultimate consequence. You have been warned!",Serenity
463,tobiasnan,One of the best sci-if's ever,10,24 January 2007,"Giving 10 to this movie is a correct. A very good cast, with well written characters. None of them is a good guy. Mal doesn't help someone despite he could. Jayne wants to kill River when she becomes a threat. The Operative is one of the best terminator type hero in the recent movies. He have only one will: killing River Tam. And nothing can stop him it this. He believes that this is the right thing to do. But at the end we see him as a friend of the crew. He lost his faith... I don't know any movie have this turn. Mr Universe wants his payment for luring the Serenity to the Alliance. Despite he is their friend. Great music. (But sometimes it suddenly stops. Like when the Serenity enters the screen the music stops because something fall off her.) Some but well placed ironical joke. And a good storyline that can be understand without watching the Firelfy series.The biggest pro for anybody, is the fact that this movie ""smells like life"". I mean there is nothing extraordinary in the surrounding. No unbelievable technology. Civilisations are peacefully living together. (A Christian priest, a Buddhist women, the Jewish Mr. Universe, geishas in the bar, and Chinese style market.) No tech speech like the StarTrek. ""Oh my god! The quadron blast, bounced off our tachion shielding of the main ionfluxus reactor core and jammed the fenomerflow!"" They simply say: ""It doesn't work, we gonna crash!"" The CGIs are beautiful, and the space has no sounds. The space battle scene was in a cloud or something, so that's why there were sounds.So overall it's a movie worth to watch it.",Serenity
464,thisisshe,"Action with wit, classic Whedon",9,13 October 2005,"In the hallways of high schools, dorm rooms of colleges and the hearts of sci-fi fans around the world, Joss Whedon is a god. The man who created TV's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"" and ""Firefly"" finally took one to the big screen. Although little seen when on TV, ""Firefly"" was a critic darling and developed a cult following. When Whedon announced to fans he would bring his canceled show to the big screen, murmurs of excitement-and doubt were heard around the world. Amazingly enough, studio heads and the powers that be allowed it to happen, with Serenity.For anyone who is a stranger to Whedon's other shows and their attitudes- pop culture and sarcasm mixed together to form a powerhouse of witty banter - Serenity may open some doors to new things. With the original cast from the show, the plot entails a mysterious Fifth Element like girl on the run and a crew of lovable misfits who pirate from the evil government, The Alliance. Mal, the ship's captain, played by Nathan Fillion and the mystery girl, River, played by relative newcomer Summer Glau help lead the cast in it's drive to truth- even if some of them have to go kicking and screaming the whole way.The movie had it's stars that stand out. But like every other Whedon production, the rest is cast so perfectly you can't help but love every character- even the guy in the background in Scene 23. Future classic lines come from every direction and make the viewer certain to take some of them home. The world created in the television show isn't explained very well in the movie. If you've got questions about the Chinese influence and why the Alliance is so bad, you'll have to do some reading or watch back episodes of the show. Without it, the story makes sense, but there's not as much depth to the plight of the crew of the Serenity against their enemies. Though the back story is lacking, this movie is one fun ride the whole time. The characters don't seem scripted and two dimensional. Their words are what you might to say if you were there. I can't help but think Whedon went into this movie hoping to bring back a TV show. All I can say is if Serenity can't revive Firefly, I don't know what can.",Serenity
465,sweetmystique32,"Read for a latecomer's straightforward, unprejudiced review...",8,26 October 2010,"TV vs. Movie--You DecidePOINT 1: The romantic aspects. The potential romance between Simon and Kaylee is so palpable you're almost ready to reach into the screen, grab their heads and make them kiss! But although it's frustrating, it's endearing to see Simon take an old- fashioned approach to courting and considering that's where it left off in the series I thought there would be some resolution there but they completely skipped over the entire romance with only a small mention of it only once near the end and the next scene is of them hittin the sheets! Wow. I mean, yeah we get it, they're gonna hook up but you know, that's hardly the point. Theirs was a romance, it was sweet, it was the only thing in this series that was relatable and they just threw it up on screen almost as an afterthought. They do get together finally, but it was unsatisfying. POINT 2: The Reavers. OK, in the series it's understood that although the Reavers are horrible, menacing and a constant thorn in everyone's side (to put it nicely) they were never ever seen in the series as a major plot point. It was explained in the show that Reavers are made, they were people once but they are essentially ""made"", just like the kid who witnessed and survived and turned into a Reaver himself. I was fine with that explanation, I really was. I didn't need a whole movie going back over all that and essentially re-inventing the whole Reavers story. I'm sorry but-Who Cares? And you know what, Mal wouldn't care either. Mal from the series would be wondering why he should get involved because frankly it has nothing to do with him and Jayne from the series would be asking what his percentage is, and he'd be right. The Reavers plot was no more than a deus ex machina for me, creating a back-story for them was really unnecessary, especially since there were so many other plot lines that the series didn't have a chance to explore. And going by the series' original premise of it being a post-war space western, nobody would care about the Alliance doing something like that. Nobody would care. That's what the Alliance does, that's the kind of mindset these frontier people would have. This sort of mentality would not be new, in fact it would be old news to them. They're too busy just trying to get by to care about what the Alliance is doing. POINT 3: I never understood Shepherd Book's role. There's apparently a graphic novel now, which I'll get one day in spite of the reviews, but for those of us who haven't read it, his role is never explained. It's alluded to right from the get-go that there's more to him than meets the eye, and-they-never-go-over-what-that-is. Not one time in the movie. That was disappointing. I was really hoping that would come to light and it not only doesn't explain anything about him - He up and dies. Dammit!POINT 4: River. I just don't know what they were thinking. So much of the story could have been about everything we didn't know and couldn't figure out from the series. So, the Alliance made River into an assassin. OK. And? We kind of already knew that from the series. I guess we're just suppose to come up with our own ideas. Thanks Joss, what do we need you for? Again, no big revelations here, but the fight scenes were bad-azz I have to say even if they were just choreographed dance moves. It was very well done. Too, I was hoping she'd be a little less broken than before. As it is, it seems like all they did was point this unstable gun in the right direction. She's-still-broken. *sighs* Great.POINT 5: The rating. Joss is quoted as saying how he always felt restricted by Fox etc, well this could have been his chance to let loose and do it right. Why, oh why Joss, would you now limit yourself to PG-13 content?POINT 6: And probably the most important point missing from the movie, it's just not funny. It's mildly amusing at best. Some of the gags worked, some didn't, it was pretty hit and miss. Frankly, if I didn't already care about this as much as I did, I wouldn't have cared about it at all. Kaylee does have the best lines of the show but I still miss the humor. Please let me reiterate, this was not a bad show, but it wasn't what I hoped for. It's truly sad, but I don't even mind that Wash died, or Book even. In this world, it's bound to happen and makes their peril real. This is a great addition to any Firefly fan's library, I just wish it was more.",Serenity

This is as exhilarating a sci-fi/action film as any moviegoer could ask for. The movie contains just the right amount of stunning visuals and elegant action sequences to give audiences the eye-candy they crave without subjecting them to sensory overload a la the second Star Wars trilogy. Disappointed fans of that saga know too well that just having a skilled technician at the helm who is capable of visual acrobatics is not enough to hold viewers' attention for the duration of a feature film. In fact, all the bright lights and loud noises can become grating or, even worse, outright boring if the technician isn't also an artist capable of constructing intriguing characters, listenable dialogue and a meaningful plot. Those three elements are what make viewers give a damn about what they're watching on-screen and, thank goodness, Joss Whedon supplies them in droves.I'll admit that, before watching Serenity, I was not convinced of Mr. Whedon's much-hyped genius. I still think that Buffy was tremendously overrated and the original Firefly series made barely a blip on my radar. My loss. After enjoying Serenity so much, I feel outright envious of those Firefly afficionados who had the chance to view the movie not as an introduction to this delightful universe full of fascinating characters but as the culmination of a storyline they had long loved and suffered for. That said, it is a credit to Mr. Whedon's talent as a scriptwriter that he immerses us initiates so gracefully and efficiently into his cosmos that we never once feel at a disadvantage. What's more, he does it with wit, humor, pathos and most of all the courage to earnestly confront us with difficult ideas and plot-twists that a less confidant filmmaker might either retreat from or cynically empty of meaning. In his first feature, Mr. Whedon has proved himself an auteur with brains, heart and guts, which is what fuels my hope that Serenity will find a wide enough audience that it can transcend the slightly pejorative category of ""cult-classic"" and take its place as simply a classic.",Serenity
468,anth-2,"A film that brought something great, something beautiful to the big screen",10,2 August 2010,"It's a funny thing when you see something expand before your eyes beyond the sum of it's parts. In the movie Serenity, it's the Firefly-class transport ship. Each piece has a certain value, but put it all together and you have a ny-indestructible starship that will take you anywhere.The characters in this movie are the same, actors drawn from gritty Vietnam soldier stories, light and funny ABC comedies, and even a cheesy WB sci-fi program, come together and produce not only a t.v. series, but also a movie that tugs at your heart strings and doesn't let go of your emotions.The backdrop of space, resistance, and the search for freedom allows those who live within it to appeal, to touch the viewer in some way. We hope for kaylee to get together with Simon, we wait for Mal to really see Inara, and that somehow River will find peace.",Serenity
469,flamingobill,What the Farscape finale should have been like,10,4 October 2005,"I might as well state that I liked the TV show. I preferred Farscape a little bit more (it had a great villain and a wild imagination), but was sorely disappointed by the mini-series's finale, and I feared Serenity would be worse. It wasn't. Far from it. The problem with Farscape is that it had too much to wrap up, and many sacrifices seemed to have been made. It was uneven, predictable, and sorely lacking the wild inspiration of the series. Serenity, on the other hand, didn't have nearly as much to wrap up, and it all fit nicely into its 2 hour running length. It was jam packed with stuff, but went along very smoothly, and kept me at the edge of my seat. It's resolutions were satisfying (unlike Farscape's), and it could make a satisfying end to the series, if it so chose to (or had to) do so, and stands up well on its own too.",Serenity
470,bacoby13,Sci-Fi Takes A Giant Leap Forward,8,2 October 2005,"Science fiction has been extremely stale as of late, and frankly, I was getting a bit fed up with many highly anticipated sci-fi films. As a casual sci-fi fan, I have to say that I get excited when good sci-fi comes around. I first heard about Serenity 4 or 5 months ago when I saw the teaser trailer, and from then on, I was intrigued. I managed to get my hands on the Firefly episodes, and I watched each one of them, simply in awe of the world that was created, but more specifically the characters. I've seen Serenity twice now. I have not stopped thinking about it since. Its the best kind of film experience...one that hits you emotionally, and yet entertains you at the same time. Having been a Firefly fan, I do have a little bit of a bias, and certainly many of the character moments were much more impacting, simply because of my previous knowledge, but don't let this stop you from seeing this amazing piece of sci-fi. Joss Whedon has done something fantastic by not letting special effects cloud the story. Story and characters are top notch, taking well known clichés, but making them unusual despite that fact. The action is intense and unrelenting, with hardly a moment to breathe in the films climactic moments. The film deserves a 10 out of 10 because of its daring, and its success on almost all fronts. Its not a perfect film, don't get me wrong, but it is leaps and bounds above anything else this genre has produced in the past 20 or so years. It deserves high marks, simply for its gumption. See this movie. The success of this film will inspire others to think above and beyond the visual effects and create engaging characters. And also, it'll get us a sequel! So, please, take the time to see this film. You will not regret it.",Serenity
471,K_Molen,"Star Wars, eat your gorram heart out...",10,1 October 2005,"Okay, so besides being set in space, the Star Wars and Firefly universes do not have much in common, but in light of the ever increasing chorus of voices hailing Serenity as the new Star Wars, I thought it a fitting title for this entry.If you haven't guessed it by now, Serenity kicks all kinds of ass. It has just the right blend of character development, secrets revealed and action sequences to satisfy. Although there are a couple of developments I could've done without, the movie is everything I hoped and an entirely worthy and appropriate follow-up (I won't call it a conclusion :P) to the TV series.I won't go into it much more than that, but I'm confident that any fan of Firefly will love Serenity. I plan on seeing it in the theatres at least a couple more times.As for the rest of you... I'm not entirely sure. I think it's a safe bet that you'll like it, love it even, but there may be a few things you don't immediately ""get."" Not so much ""get"" as in understand about the plot and characters, but ""get"" as in ""feel the vibe of."" If that makes any kind of sense...Oh! I almost forgot, the only real complaint I have about the movie is due to something that was done entirely for the benefit of Firefly virgins. The first sequence following the credits is layed out real pretty like, with each character saying just the right words at just the right time to bring everyone up to speed with who people are and what they're doing. There's nothing really wrong with that, and I'm glad Whedon took the time to do it, but there's something about the wording and the delivery of that segment that simply seem stilted.But, you know, since that's the best (worst?) complaint I can come up with, it's pretty obvious that I'm nitpicking.See it sometime soon. You can thank me later.",Serenity
472,beauty-mark,"They Have Done the Impossible, and That Makes Them Mighty",10,26 May 2006,"I have to admit, when I walked into the theatre to see this movie, I was nervous. I obviously wasn't the only one. The theatre was very nearly full, but instead of talking away my unease, it only increased it. I was really hoping for a movie, not one of those major blockbusters that goes down in history as ""the best movie of the year!"" and everyone remembers for the longest time. But I wasn't looking for a low budget movie either.While I love many of those films, I truly do, it gets rather annoying after a while, the hype that they get, take 'Narnia' for instance. It wasn't not a great film, but everyone gave it thirty thousand star reviews. But my review is not about 'Narnia', so I will shut up with the 'Narnia' babbling, and being on 'Serenity.' I don't really know why this film appealed to me the way it did. Maybe it was because of the non-stop action that kept me on the edge of my seat, or the superb acting, or even, the phenomenal writing of it. I had been planning to go get another soda, but I didn't want to miss a minute of it. Not even for my favourite candy, licorice. There was a little something in this film for everybody, and I can safely say that I walked out of the theatre satisfied. Like the line from the TV series, they have done the impossible, and that makes them mighty. -trombone-player",Serenity
473,tantilion,Another Joss Whedon masterpiece!,10,7 June 2006,"OK, the following review comes from a Joss Whedon fan boy, but I have managed to insult Buffy (which I love dearly), so it's not HORRIBLY biased (just a little) Serenity dose everything you want an adventure movie to do. I has cool action, well written, witty, quotable, funny, and downright cool dialog, and amazing cinematography and feel.From the begging you are immersed in the world, with the short but sweet exposition gotten out of the way first, with some interesting little twists to make it a seem less tacked on.From that point on you have an excellent and entertaining series of adventures that bring you back to Han Solo and the original star wars, and a feel that defines space western.As with all of Whedon's work, the writing is on the highest level, switching between drama, comedy, and action quickly but smoothly.I should also point out that I watched this before I saw Firefly (the show which it is based off of), and it made perfect sense. Don't feel obligated to watch those first (though you should watch those too, as they are just as good as this movie, though obviously shorter) So go out and watch serenity this instant!",Serenity
474,Lego_Darth,Wow!,10,16 May 2006,"For those who think that this movie is overrated, think again. Easily, the greatest creation of Joss Whedon's ever. The film should generate massive respect for a creative genius who before has been doubted. From beginning to end, the excellence of this piece is evident. The story is captivating, the music is tear jerking, the acting is top notch (eventhough there isn't a single big-name star on the cast-list), and the special effects exceed those of any Star Wars movie in both realism and boldness. Bottomline, if you haven't seen it, watch it; if you dislike it, pick it up again. Either way, you're missing out on greatness if you deny this film both a place in your heart and a place in you collection.",Serenity

Excellent story, acting, action, and everything else we come to expect from Joss. Most plot points introduced during the show are answered in this movie. The only bad thing I have to say about Serenity is that people not familiar with the series will definitely be left scratching their heads through most of the movie. This is not a bad thing for Firefly fans, but bad for box office receipts, and bad box office means no sequels/renewals of the series. Hopefully people will be curious enough to see the movie, then go rent/buy the series on DVD.In summary, get out and see the movie, even if you are not a fan of the series.",Serenity
476,WalkThatTalk,Science fiction rarely gets any better than this!,9,10 October 2010,"I have spent time hunting through for movies worth watching, and although it seems rather wasteful at times but it's when a gem like this falls in your lap that makes it all worth IT. This is a thoroughly entertaining movie that is rather unknown and unappreciated. It has all the elements of a classic science fiction. Please read on a bit of spoilers/appetizers if u wish.. A world of several galaxies ruled by ruthless and unreasonable federation and outnumbered liberal groups fighting for independence. The federation is out to force their ways on people and subdues free will regardless of the costs. They have a powerful psychic who becomes a threat as she might know a secret so grave that it threatens the very foundation of federation and their methods. Her brother frees her and escapes on a ship with an interesting crew. This ship becomes the unwilling guardian of the girl and the secret first. In their course they discover how remarkably gifted/cursed that girl and she leads them to the secret. ""The secret: Federation tried to control a planet by experimenting on it that killed 90% of the population and turned 10% into cannibalistic monsters. The whole universe is oblivious of this and federations wants to keep it that way."" Knowing the secret they are morally bound to transmit it to the entire universe. How's that for a good script? And yes in the midst of all this is good special effects, action sequences, suspense, clever dialogues and tinge of humor. The entire cast has done a terrific job but Nathan Fillion (Captain of ship) and Chiwetel Ejiofor (soldier of the federation) are exceptional.To be fair, like any other movie it has it's flaws but if we look past it we can see a thoroughly entertaining 2 hour action packed movie. I was shocked to see that it did so poorly at the box office but then again so did Shawshank Redemption. Anyhow to all the movie buffs i would say give it a shot. And to the director of Serenity i would say could we have a sequel please? There sure is a room for one.",Serenity

The characters have a depth to them that is unheard of in modern television, and through the series they just keep peeling back layers, and through the movie they did it again!If you see NO other movies this year, and like Sci Fi OR Westerns OR well written stories OR Comedies OR political satire OR... you get the idea. See the series (Firefly) then see the movie (Serenity).",Serenity
478,lesburton,Amazing!!!!,10,30 March 2011,I decided that I was going to watch this movie after I watched all the episodes of the show Firefly first. This payed off but it didn't change my view of the story. What it really do is get me that much more informed about the characters of the movie and their backgrounds.This film is really one of the better science fiction films of the past decade and really should be recognized as that. It's hard to make a science fiction film already and to throw it on top of that it's even harder to make a film that is based on a TV series that was canceled after one season. I really have to hand it to Joss Whedon with this film though. Absolutely stunning in all aspects. This film really is exciting right from the get go and never lets up through the end of the movie. I truly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in Science Fiction and in Westerns for that matter. Serenity truly is a winner.,Serenity
479,antiussentiment,You got to love a top shelf B,6,4 September 2011,"I enjoyed the Firefly series, so when i saw that the movie was on the TV last night I thought I'd sit in. however over the last few weeks I've been watching Six Feet Under and Game of Thrones. It appears this has affected my judgment as i found the acting in Serenity a little wooden. Fillion delivers his work with the warmth of a trout and found my self much more detached from the characters than I remember. The screen writing had a too much groansome cheese for my liking. Too much yabber, when a look or some body language would do. A highlight of the film is the special affects and art direction, they were pretty good. The set work and ship design are great.Having said all this, I should point out that the strongest part of this film is it's plot. For that alone it's worth the view. Don't expect a well crafted masterpiece but it's a damn good B grader. Definably worth a view for Scifi fans.",Serenity
480,shadownlite,Waste of Time,1,5 January 2006,"I was told by many friends and acquaintances that this film was something I ""HAD"" to see. I am not a huge TV watcher so have never seen the show ""Firefly"" but they told me that would not matter and I would still enjoy the movie. They were wrong.""Serenity"" tried to be smart, tries to be edgy, and tries to be witty yet falls flat every time. The acting is very Z-Grade and ""Sci Fi Channel Movie"" like. The lines try way too hard to be witty and cool but embarrassing to hear uttered by human beings because they try so hard to be ""cool/witty/funny"" with them, The editing was all over the place and attempted to be edgy but came off as if someone in just randomly edited parts of the film together. The special effects were not special at all.I spent most the time wondering what the hell was going on, why, and why should I care in the first place. Maybe, if I was into TV shows so bad that they get canceled, I would watch all the ""Firefly"" episodes so that I would know what was going on in this film. Unfortunately, I doubt that would be fun and I can think of millions of things I would much rather do with my time than sit through any of the TV show.I know there are some almost rabid fans of this movie and the TV show Serenity. I am not knocking you in your fandom of this show. I just don't think a wide section of society would find this film interesting at all and that it was made for the small fandom that surrounded the show. So, fans of the show, enjoy the movie, just don't expect others to instantly like it unless they are into cheesy, Sci Fi Channel, movies.",Serenity
481,megagestur,The coolest thing I have seen in long time,9,5 June 2006,"I must admit I was bit, well a lot more than bit sceptical about this movie first when I saw it on the cinema listings and I didn't go to see it in the theater. Oh boy was I wrong there and I had to see it on a DVD in my laptop. I haven't seen the Firefly series, well series, but if the show was half as good as this movie I can't imagine what those guys were thinking when they canceled it. This movie has it all, good action scene, well made characters, reasonably good plot and a splash of humor to keep it going without crossing the line. The makers of this movie have made a outstanding work regarding the characters of this movie because for those who haven't seen the shows and haven't gotten to know them through there, there is nothing to worry about. You are not thrown into some scenes were the persons back story plays any big part so you are not required to have seen the shows to fully appreciate this movie, at least that is my feeling. Maybe there are parts of this movie that I will understand better when I have seen the shows and that is something I am certain to do in very near future.Overall this is a great movie and with out a doubt the coolest thing I have seen in long, long time.",Serenity
482,mellowstreet,Not bad,6,10 October 2005,"I never saw a single episode of Firefly and had no idea what to expect of this film. It is not bad. It doesn't deserve to be in the top 250 movies of all time and it is certainly not a classic, but it is an okay way to spend two-hours even if you're not a die-hard sci-fi fan. The movie follows the standard Weddon formula. Central female protagonist with incredible talents, hanging with a bunch of friends who are outside the mainstream, facing seemingly insurmountable odds. It is more Star Trek than Star Wars. This was not a grand cinematic opera, this was a movie about people and characters. River's wondering around looking deep but not actually doing much got annoying at times, but apart from that, if you want to see spaceships, action and have some fun, you could do much worse than go and see Serenity.",Serenity
483,sellington-1,A stunning introduction,10,11 March 2006,"My expectations of Serenity were very low because Outland thoroughly quashed my curiosity about spittoons in space a few decades ago. The loaner DVD was offered with Doom and Dune, so I figured to waste a few hours on mindless, predictable violence as a warm-up for The Classic...and never even got to Dune. Eight hours after starting the Serenity DVD, I tore myself away from the fourth presentation of the film just long enough to go to my nearest video store where I bought the complete season of Firefly. I've been studying this body of work every day for the past six weeks. Somehow it never gets old. Rather it applies pulmonary stimulators and cardiac infusers to my cortical electrodes with copious quantities of intelligent humor and insightful suggestiveness that work on every level to entertain and delight. I truly hope this universe is a work in progress, leading to further adventures of the crew of Serenity, but the film and the series have led me to explore source material while I'm waiting. Reviewing Buffy and Angel episodes has helped to flesh out some of the mysteries foreshadowed in the 'verse, but generous references lavished in text and commentaries have led me to Macbeth, Have Gun - Will Travel, and even to Dick Cavett monologues. Serenity is a powerful addiction that offers tremendous value to absolutely everyone.",Serenity
484,voltage11,Browncoats and pre-browncoats friendly...,10,26 December 2005,"Whether you claim yourself to be a faithful 'browncoat' or if your response to that statement is 'my winter coat is blue', Serenity is most likely going to entertain you. I myself had never seen nor heard about the story of Serenity before watching the film in theaters, but it caught my interest so much that I purchased the series Firefly that very night. Now that I have seen the series and the movie once again, I have to admit my understanding of the film has skyrocketed.For the avid fans, this is a solid representation of Firefly and it appears it was an easy transition. Every element that is loved by the fans - the wit, the relationships, the smart action - is embedded in Serenity. Then again, if you are an avid fan, you already know this.For those, like me, who have no idea what all this jargon means I think you will still enjoy the film. Granted, you may be 'ignorant' of the significance of many of the events that occur, but that shouldn't prevent you from being entertained. You may even end up like me - leaving a positive review after committing hours of watching Firefly the series and Serenity multiple times.",Serenity
485,Can89,A brilliant cinematic experience!,9,5 December 2005,"When I first heard about Firefly I wasn't least bit interested in watching the show. Sci-fi was a genre I completely abhorred. The idea of cow-boys in space just didn't interest me. Also, having the actor who played one of my least favourite characters in Buffyverse, as the main protagonist of the show, put me off even more.But alas, the magic of Joss Whedon had to prevail.Curiosity got the better of me and I watched the first episode. Needless to say, I was hooked! I ended up watching the whole season, savoring each an every episode, as I knew there wasn't going to be anymore.I waited a good long while for the movie to release here. And when it did I honestly couldn't contain my excitement. I went to watch the movie on the opening night itself, as I entered darkened cinema hall, I was surprised to see a grand total of three people. Not counting myself and my brothers.Anyway, After the end credits rolled, I experienced a rush of emotions. I felt happy, satisfied and sad, all at the same time, for this was probably the end of it. The film left me totally dazed, a feeling, I'm sure all Whedon fans are familiar with.Serenity was unbelievably exciting, scary, funny, emotional and action-packed! As in, a typical Joss Whedon fare.*SPOILER ALERT* (Don't read on if you haven't watched the movie yet.) Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his team of rogue independence fighters find themselves having to fight both the alliance and the Reavers when they come to the rescue of a young telepathic girl River Tam, who has extraordinary physical strength, and her brother Simon, who are on the run from the alliance.In possession of knowledge that could ruin the alliance, an assassin is sent out to destroy River. After much deliberation, the crew agrees to help the girl discover the awful truth about a mysterious planet called Miranda on the edge of the universe.The Alliance responsible for the Reavers, River's secret, what they did to her and why their after her? The movie tied up all the loose ends. Except maybe for Shepherd Book's past, which still remains a mystery to me.It was great seeing our beloved crew again on the big screen! I loved the way all the main characters of Serenity's crew were introduced in one single uncut shot.All the actors were totally in-character. Did I mention how much I love Mal? Though I love everyone, and the relationships they share with one another. Mal and River have always been my favourites.I love everything about Capt. Reynolds. Mal's straightforwardness and his ability to do what needs to be done, without being too concerned about things like killing people or breaking the law. He is one of the most multi-layered characters to have come out of Jossverse. Full marks to Nathan Fillion! He's absolutely brilliant in this film.River is equally brilliant. Her innocent child-like manner is endearing. River's presence just makes any moment or scene truly amazing.I wasn't too depressed when Book died. In fact I breathed a sigh of relief as I thought that this was the 'character death' of the movie. So naturally, I was left gaping at the screen when Wash died. I should know by now that no one is safe in Jossverse.There wasn't much time to cry over Wash's death, as it was too sudden. And the battle was still underway. Although my heart went out to Zoe, when she took charge and snapped into soldier-mode. I don't remember felling so sad while watching a Hollywood movie, ever.Amidst the sadness, the movie had it's equal share of light, funny moments. Making us laugh during the most intense and emotional moments is Whedon's specialty. There are some extremely funny moments which I loved, for instance: River's line, after they escaped the Reavers ""I ate a bug."" is simply priceless or Mal's line at the start ""What was that?"" which was also the last line of the movie.All the action sequences are brilliantly shot. Especially River fighting the Ravears in the finale. Summer was outstanding in that fight.Great plot, stunning visuals, amazing acting, witty humor, brilliant direction! Although I was disappointed at the lack of western background score, which was highly prominent in the Series.One word to describe Serenity would be: Perfection! Serenity is one of the best sci-fi movies of recent times. It you haven't watched it yet, well, what are you waiting for?",Serenity

487,nonon99_99,banal and strange,5,7 October 2005,"I do not understand how those funny dialogues relate to the plot or the characters. They are rather something without functionality, make this film a bit disorganised in total. The story basically has nothing new, finally I see it is again about conspiracy. But if the story is old, there are still new ways to tell it, sadly here it is still that banal. The opening minutes, in which the reality shifts, give me some expectation, but just like those verbal tricks, these end up by nothing. The military official's cruelty and trickiness end up by an illogic action scene. In the debauched pub, the sexy doctor and the luscious woman have nothing happened in between. Later he shows his hunky body to us, that is fine but a bit too late. The film simply picks up what are already there, changes a little bit, then makes a staled mixture. I quite understand the excitement of its fans, it is perhaps like seeing a long term mate but I cannot enjoy it.",Serenity
488,square-peg,The Magnificent Eight / Nine,9,18 October 2005,"Those who tired of Roddenberry's smug and glossy Federation from 'Star Trek' will find an antidote here. Mankind has settled elsewhere in the universe but all of our faults, foibles and failings are intact. Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his lovable band of pirates scrape a living on the rim of the semi-fascistic central government called the Alliance. The story is compelling, if familiar, and the special effects up to standard, but this is not why this movie is worth seeing. You really care about the characters, they have genuine chemistry and dimensions numbering more than two. The dialogue is funny and witty and the action moves along at a good old pace, pausing for a little emotional down-time here and there. Joss Whedon deserved to have his series (from which this movie sprung) given a little more time, but that's Hollywood for you. If people stay away because there's no 'big name' attached to the project then, Gentle Cinema-goers, we deserve all the hackneyed, reconstituted, mindless pap that gets thrown at us. Something with a little brains along with its brawn should do better.",Serenity
489,TheJibber,Definitely worth the watch. Recommend watching Firefly first.,8,7 December 2016,"Serenity is an awesome movie for anyone who is a fan of Firefly. The movie would be pretty confusing and difficult to follow along in terms of character development, plot line, and overall what's going on. This is why I recommend watching Firefly on Netflix before watching Serenity.Other than that, the plot was great. Chiwetel Ejiofor did an amazing job as the villain. It was great to see all the Firefly characters back at it. Perfect amount of twists as well. The plot line was definitely different than what I was expecting from the movie. Because of this, I thought the movie was great. Like I said, please watch Firefly before Serenity in order to get the full experience of the movie. Otherwise you are going to be very lost and confused.",Serenity

The trailers had intrigued me, though, as well as enthusiastic word of mouth from ""Firefly"" fans. Also, I've always been a fan of sci-fi. After seeing the movie, I have to say it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Even though I wasn't familiar with the series, the movie explains enough of the background that I was not at all confused at any point. ""Serenity"" stood on its own fantastically.The crew of the ship Serenity are a somewhat rag-tag bunch captained by Mal, a man who fought against the galactic Alliance and lost. Serenity usually does jobs under the radar of the Alliance, but when they offer transport to a young doctor and his sister, Simon and River Tam, they find they've got more than they bargained for - River has a secret, and the Alliance has a strong interest in her. There is an excellent mixture of action, clever dialog, and character development. At no point was I distracted by my lack of knowledge about the series. If you enjoy sci-fi of any kind, or really, if you enjoy a very well-written and carried-out movie, go see ""Serenity""! You won't regret it.",Serenity
491,darketernal,"Everyone should like it, fans will love it",9,30 December 2005,"Being a fan of the original TV show that this film is based off of, 'Firefly', I'm probably prone to like it a little more than your average person. Still, this fact does not stop ""Serenity"" from being a killer movie. It begins with the characters. All of the characters are very passionate and have a very distinct personality. They are all someone who can be sympathized with and that is what primarily moves the story along. When something happens to them, you immediately feel remorse because they are such dynamic characters. The plot is something of a mix. It is a sci-fi futuristic look at the world with a foot still in reality. Sure there are spaceships, but there aren't any laser guns or energy shields or anything like that. It presents a very unique view that works very well in this movie. The story itself paces itself well, also. There is a little raid in the beginning of the movie which does very little to the film but to give fan service (the show centered on these characters being thieves), though it is a very cool piece. Other than that, the story plays out very thoroughly with little to no filler needed.""Serenity"" is a good movie with extremely compelling characters, an interesting setting and plot, and a well-paced story. I would definitely recommend it to fans of the TV show, but those who have never seen it should pick it up, as well.",Serenity
492,srfm79,Great sci-fi adventure!,8,21 May 2006,"""Serenity"" is a very good, exciting sci-fi / adventure / action movie. A friend of mine found some of the acting substandard and was turned off, but I was hooked throughout the entire film. The visual format is perhaps not very grand (with aesthetics suited for a TV-show), but the editing and pace of action makes it one thrilling ride. It has some interesting quasi-philosophical points as well, dealing with moral, religious and political issues: The classic conflict of plights in ethics is demonstrated by crew leader Mal in the many situations where he has to decide whose life he should give the highest priority. The portrayed strength and danger of people believing to be right is also interesting, not only in connection with a discussion of religion, but also as a selling point for philosophy: we should, at least some times, doubt if we are right. And obviously the film has some points about freedom of speech and distribution of information to the public (think of the role of the Internet in oppressive regimes) - hence the tag line, ""can't stop the signal"". But do not expect to be educated - just expect to be entertained.",Serenity
493,jameselford,Serenity Special Edition!!! Coming soon!!!,10,15 May 2007,"If you're like me, then the thoughts of a ""double-dip"" sicken you (double-dips refer to a distributor releasing more than one version of a movie on DVD for extra profit.) But then, here comes an exception that warms the soul: Serenity, the underrated, powerful sci-fi epic from the mastermind himself, Joss Whedon, is being re-released in the USA as a double discer. Last time it came with a few docs, a commentary and a horrible cover.Now...it comes with DTS sound (less compressed soundtrack which in turn allows the sound quality some breathing room, i.e. kicks ASS), a new commentary with Whedon and Nathan Fillion and Ron Glass (the latter whom will possibly shed some light on his character's shroud of mysteries). New docs, new vids, hopefully even better transfer (although the original was damn near perfect).Here's the most important thing...and this is what rocks about DVDs...the only reason the film got made was on the back of a DIFFERENT STUDIO'S SALE OF THE ORIGINAL SERIES (Firefly, of which this is a sequel. Hence---and I know I'm setting myself up for major disappointment here---the possibility of a sequel on the back of this one! The HD-DVDs sols very well, as did the DVDs...maybe this one'll be a clincher.Moral of the story: want a sequel, like DTS and enjoy insights from the main cast? Buy this DVD, and maybe lightning will strike twice...!",Serenity
494,Nobrayn,Not a single moment in this film is wasted.,10,10 October 2005,"This film is an utter masterpiece. I have never raved so much about a film in my life as I have been lately about 'Serenity'. So many words come to mind when I think about it...Beautiful, heartbreaking, shocking, funny, immersive, exciting... Much more...The chemistry between the actors who make up crew of Serenity is unbelievably genuine. Joss made the right decision to ensure the original cast was wrangled up for the making of this movie.The dialog and back story is both intelligent and engaging. There was not one second where I didn't have my eyes glued to the screen.See this movie. Sci-Fi fans and non fans alike can and will enjoy it. Even if you haven't a clue what 'Firefly' is, all the more reason to check this out, and then pick up the 'Firefly' episodes on DVD.",Serenity
495,etdweasel,Do you remember the first time you saw Star Wars?,10,6 October 2005,"How'd you feel afterwards? Like George Lucas had been following you around, making notes about what you read, what you watched, what you loved? Like he'd interviewed your friends, your relatives, checked with Santa about your Christmas wish lists? Do you remember how many people you dragged back to the theatre, over and over, converting all your friends like some demented Jedi missionary? Do you remember how you waited for ""Return of the Jedi"", how you wrote letters about how it shouldn't be named ""Revenge of the Jedi"" and you stood in line for tickets for 3 days? How long's it been since you felt that way? Yeah, you're in your 40's now, you've got a 40-hour-a-week job that you spend 70 hours a week doin', your wife wants you to wallpaper the bathroom, your kids are away at college buying I-Pods with their book money, it just cost you $70 to have your dog's teeth cleaned and all you wanna do is feel like you did back then.Well, this is your lucky day, my friend; you have a chance to relive that experience. Joss Whedon has brought you a little Christmas time capsule called ""Serenity."" You've heard of Joss; ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer,"" ""Angel"" and a little series on Fox called ""Firefly."" That last was a special kind of show; great writing, a tight cast, a haunting score and a story line that made all the other sc-fi you'd seen lately seem like episodes of ""Meet the Press."" Fox did their best to kill it; they refused to show the pilot, they showed episodes out of order, they pre-empted it and then abandoned it with 3 episodes left unaired. Like 40 or 50 other Fox shows in recent years, it was dead.But it wasn't dead. The fans, Browncoats, as they call themselves, immediately started writing letters, making phone calls, posting messages on sc-fi web sites and blogs, all in an effort to save the show. That, and Joss wouldn't quit. He told the cast they were canceled and, almost in the same breath, told them not not to give up, that he'd find them a home. Together they made enough noise that Fox decided to release the series on DVD, figuring that'd shut the fans up and they could go back to putting quality shows on the air like ""The Simple Life."" And DVD sales took off. Word spread, mostly fan to fan. People began having DVD viewing parties, buying DVD for friends, setting up booths an sci-fi conventions to promote the show and the DVD's with no help from Fox. You see, they loved the show and it's characters and the folks who gave them life. And, they made enough noise (and bought enough DVDs) that they got the attention of Universal Studios who, perhaps remembering Star Trek the above mentioned Star Wars , decided to spring $40,000,000 for a movie.It was money well spent. ""Serenity"" is everything the series and the above mentioned franchises were, and more. Mr Whedon, being simply the most eloquent script writer on the planet, has given the film a story line that not only satisfies (at least, temporarily) the Fireflyistas, it's a knock down, kick butt film in it's own right. I won't go into plot details here; this site abounds with plenty of reviews that'll explain the story. I'm here to explain the heart. See it now. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cheer, you'll tell your friends and drag 'em to the theatre and wait in line three days for the sequel. You'll regain your youth. And the next coat you buy just might be a bit brown...",Serenity
496,richardc020,Fundamentally Rocked My Film Making Experience,10,2 October 2005,"No spoilers from me! This film achieves amazingly on all factors: writing, cinematography (6-minute single-shot intro-credits sequence, human parts of battle scenes), SFX (galactic battles, even ships themselves exude actor's emotions), acting (fantastic facial expressions from River, deadpan from Jayne, verbal spears from Zoe, Inara's desperate-yet-strong looks, Simon's call to arms, Shepard's blood pressure-lowering tone of voice, barbed one-liners from all, just awe-inspiring), humor (where to even start?), and the wanderlust of unbounded space (with its unknowns which the story uses to maximum advantage). Marketed as an action film, as with most amazing films, labels and ratings only limit its full excellence.The sheer awe makes me unable to convey to you how amazing it is. The only fitting review I could write would be: go see it. I'll rest the whole of my artistic credibility with this film. I breathed but a few times during the film, afraid of missing a single splendid moment. I cannot remember ever being so fully engrossed with a film and its fan culture. The audience clapped at least 5x at climatic moments. I, uncharacteristically, felt like leaping out of my chair to cheer, groan, and hoot-and-holler on the film's emotional ride. It was like a spiritual experience.Hopefully it fulfills corporate profiteering, but Universal can be proud of a fantastic film in its name.",Serenity
497,ruthfreese,Can't say enough good things,10,6 July 2006,"I wish I'd seen this in theaters, but I didn't, because I had no idea it even existed. I just rented the DVD almost by accident, and was I blown away. The action was exciting and the plot line logical. The special effects were excellent, but used to support the show, not an excuse to have a show in the first place, unlike some over-hyped and overbudgetted movies I've seen recently (SW I, II & III come to mind). What really makes this show stand out is the wonderful writing. The characters are wonderfully realized and played. The cast members are all really strong, and all the Serenity crew get a shot at some of the limelight. They actually interact with each other like they're a family...sometimes arguing, sometimes working together, sometimes standing together in shocked silence, but always there for each other.There's some humour, some excitement, one scene that made me choke up, and one scene that shocked me bolt upright.I have one warning, though. Save your pennies before you see this, because you'll want to buy the Firefly DVD set afterwards. And you should. It's also fantastic.Lots of other reviewers on this site have commented on what a shame it was that this show was never properly supported or advertised. I won't reiterate except to say I agree completely. What a waste.",Serenity
498,DieselJester-1,Excellent Thrill Ride,10,1 October 2005,"***WARNING, CONTAINS Spoilers*** Joss Wheton does it again and makes a masterful work of art in the movie to follow up the Firefly series. OK, so let's ignore the fact for now that a couple of the characters die (and leaves you wondering how in the world a sequel can be made) and focus on the movie itself. Fans of the series will get many of the inside jokes and interplay between the crew which will leave you laughing for hours afterward. The special effects were awesome as usual and Wheton does an excellent job of keeping with the series norm in that there is no sound in space. Granted, the climatic space battle near the end has multiple sounds in space, but that can be explained away if you stretch the imagination a bit.Also many questions are answered but more do come up. I think the trade-off is well worth in that regard. We do find out why the Alliance is hell bent on finding the Tams and we find out the origins of the dreaded Reavers. Some of the questions that pop up in its place include the past of Shepard Book and who exactly the Operative is.Overall, I think that fans of the series will be greatly pleased with the movie. A message to Joss Wheton: BRING ON THE Sequel!!!",Serenity
499,erhmntx,Excellent Though Over-Hyped,9,16 October 2005,"Serenity belongs in an elite category of films, those that when you finish watching, you think, ""damn, I just saw something special"". It starts the wheels turning in your head and may even steal a few hours of your sleep the night you see it.It is not, however, in the same league as the first Matrix, or (insert your favorite most revolutionary film here). At times, it seems a little formulaic, a little too glib, even a little preachy. I wouldn't call it a ""masterpiece"", nor is it overwhelmingly groundbreaking.That said, Serenity is thought-provoking, touching, laugh-out-loud funny, and complex enough to keep you interested. The universe created is both believable and engaging. As long as you don't expect to be blown away ala Matrix I or categorically detest sci-fi, you won't be disappointed.Note: I have not seen ""Firefly"", though now I would like to.",Serenity
500,dying_fetus,Worst sci-fi of 2000?,2,7 January 2006,"This could very well be the worst sci-fi movie ever made, or at least in this century.The screenplay is the same old as often seen in sci-fi or action movies, the ""bad"" guys creates a deadly weapon and it falls into the ""wrong"" hands. Throw in a savage ""race"" called the Reavers who feast on living people and bad actors and actress, and you have Serenity in a nut shell. All of the actors/actress aren't bad of course, but you won't see Summer Glau getting a reward for best role, I can guarantee you that. When she is fighting, it doesn't seem like she really means it. This movie has some good potential, but it simply doesn't get there.* SPOILER * How could Mal get a sword in his stomach and still be able to fight The Operator? He limped a bit, but that was all, he should be laying paralyzed and near his death, I know it's sci-fi, but some realism would be nice? * END OF SPOILER*Watched it yesterday with a couple of friends, I told them that this movie was listed as one of the top250 movies on IMDb, and that usually means it is watchable and good entertainment, but this movie has proved that you can expect the worst even from IMDb top250 movies, a shame.",Serenity

Just kidding...he he...but really,i still don't understand why great shows always get canceled!??Does anyone have a clue?? This movie was everything i expected and much more. The cast is perfect and the story is solid. Its one big adventure loaded with action, and while there are some predictable turns in this feature, you still can't wait for them to happen. If for some strange reason you never have watched the ""Firefly"" episodes, then you will want to see them after this movie and hope just like me and a lot of other people, some network,will restart the show or make a few more features like Serenity",Serenity

Does it have a message like that ""be careful, you've been destroying your world, even the universe!""? I don't think so... Then? A sci-fi movie may hasn't got a subject which absorb the audience. When we meet a movie like that, we expect ""science"" or something that inform us - at least. But, it doesn't exist either.There are a few jokes that makes me laugh... Rest of it... Waste of time.Meanwhile... Role-playin' is horrible.",Serenity
503,johanncats,Enjoyable Space Western,9,2 February 2011,"I caught 'serenity' on TV the first time I saw it. It was about halfway through when I picked it up. There was a scene with a girl pointing at a screen, showing where in the universe they had to go. Then some one said that there was dangerous territory 'in between'. Hello, I thought', that's space you're talking about, it's three dimensional, you can pass over it, or fly to the side, or miss it by light years altogether. And I thought: this has to be a stupid movie. Having not much of a life and very little to do I kept watching and to my surprise started to enjoy the movie immensely. There was more rubbish ahead, like the passage through a sort of a minefield of cluttered spaceships which are ridiculously close together, something that would never ever occur in real empty space (alright, I'm not Stephen Hawking; I'm still pretty sure though). Still, the film had a strange special feel to it, that made me keep watching.The special feel seems to me that the film doesn't take itself too seriously. It shouldn't, for the story really harks back to the very early days of science fiction, the great days of the twenties and thirties of the twentieth century, when space was depicted as a new frontier. Just read the early stories of Isaac Asimov (there was a great edition of these stories in the dutch library I went to as a teenager; I liked the bits between the stories where he wrote about writing them. I think it was a doubleday edition, in a yellow jacket) and you'll get the drift. It was boys and girls in rockets, flying all about the universe, discovering new worlds and fighting bad guys.From that angle I was able to suspend all disbelief and discard my practical criticism. This enabled me to focus on various features that the film is rich with. The layered story is not that intricate, but it's well focused and it unfolds really well. I think that the screenplay writer did a great job in building suspension and uncovering the diverse layers of the multiple plots. On the whole, it felt like an improbable, but credible universe I was presented with.That universe also looked great. The characters are all lookers, the men are fine and strong, the women are really really hot and they all are brave. The worlds they visited looked like they had a meaning, though as usual, they suffered too much from the 'village' syndrome that affects so many science fiction writing. Worlds are always stamped with a single purpose, like some kind of guild in the middle ages. That's nonsense of course, but alright, I had suspended disbelief already.I liked most of the dialogue, though it was admittedly corny and over the top, as well as the acting. In my view that fitted the film perfectly. Though it is not a 'funny' film, I thought that some scenes were excellently humorous, not so much in a jokey kind of way, but in the way they had an impact on the characters (and on me, frankly). There were some major bummers for everyone involved, and then mostly for the bad guy.Talking about that, the good versus bad stuff is quite well executed here. There is hardly any black and white, it's more like certain shades of grey fighting for priority. In the end, there is even a kind of an ethical victory to be had, which is by no means certain in advance for any of the characters involved. I found that quite satisfying, as it states the risk that some take and the guts it takes to do that.To top it off, for me, the film gave me some very strong emotions. I can't exactly tell why that is, maybe simply because of the beautiful women. The scene where River Tam is left alone to die with the Reavers really got to me when I first saw it. Then it turned out to be another example of typical Serenity humour and I was very pleased. When she stands there with that axe dripping against that background, it's just a great shot.I have seen Serenity a couple of times since I first caught it on TV, and for me it's one of the great scifi films. It truly catches the spirit that I thought was there when I was a kid. So it makes me feel that way again, and that just feels very good. Nine stars for that.",Serenity
504,Gilliam123,Review of Joss Whedon's Serenity,8,22 November 2011,"I bought this film at a second-hand DVD shop for £1.50, and my expectations were low. But don't expect to be disappointed, because this film not only has a surprisingly deep plot line, and an enjoyable cast. I know there has been a series called Firefly, which the film is based on, but I haven't seen it. The film is written and directed by the creator of the series, Joss Whedon (who also created Buffy and Angel). It stars Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk, Adam Baldwin, Summer Glau, Chiwetel Ejoifer, Gina Torres, Morena Baccarin, Jewel Staite, Sean Maher, Ron Glass and Michael Krumholtz. The plot follows Captain Malcolm Raynolds(Nathan Fillion)and his crew aboard his ship Serenity. The cast for this movie is the same as the cast of the television series (so don't expect any huge movie stars), and the only significant newcomer is Chiwetel Ejoifer, who plays the film's protagonist, known as The Operative. The Operative is after one of the ship's crew, a girl called River Tam, who in secret is a lethal weapon that can be set off at any time. The hunt spans a fair bit of the firefly universe, and reveals the origins of the mysterious Reavers. Likable performances (with surprisingly deep characters), an above par director and an already established plot make this a film to watch.If you're looking for a smart, entertaining, and bold sci-fi, and don't want a Vin Deisel film, then this the film for you.",Serenity
505,stevinmarshall,Fan-Bloody-Tastic! (Contains minor spoilers),10,6 February 2006,"OK, so we ALL know that Joss Whedon will always be the Apple to J.J Abrams Microsoft, but that is just one of the things that makes this film (and the TV series) so brilliant.I must confess to never having seen Firefly prior to watching Serenity, but you don't have to. The interplay between the characters explains who each person is without an overabundance of exposition and lots of unnecessary explanation. 2 minor errors I made from not seeing the series was 1) I assumed that it was the crew of Serenity who helped Simon rescue his sister and 2) Inara was Mal's ex-wife/girlfriend. Neither of these assumptions was true, but neither made an iota of difference to the story.Serenity successfully breaks free of the constrains of television and has become (in my opinion - which is what this is all about) the best and most enjoyable sci-fi movie since the original Star Wars. Malcolm Reynolds has been heralded as the new Han Solo, and comes across as a mix between that character and some of the darker elements of Clint Eastwoods' William Munny character from Unforgiven.The ship Serenity is a character all on its (her?) own and we genuinely believe that these renegade characters regard this ship as their home.The plot surrounds The Alliance's attempts to recapture Simon Tam and, more importantly, his sister River. If I had seen the series first, I might have wondered why an intergalactic government was making such a lot of fuss over one little teenager, regardless of how gifted she is. The Alliance dispatch an Operative (think of a black-ops CIA agent with a penchant for sharp edges), played with menacing calm by Chiwetel Ejiofer, to flush her out. As he says, ""Secrets are not my concern. Keeping them is!"" It appears that River is not only a valuable asset to The Alliance, she could also be a threat to them, the crew of Serenity and anyone else near her. You see, River knows a great secret. She just doesn't know that she knows it...The film never lets itself get bogged down in the ""see how good our special effects are"" style of modern sci-fi film-makers (yes, Mr Lucas, I do mean you!) because although the FX are very good, it is a character-driven piece. Having said that, Joss Whedons technical proficiency in film-making is given space to really stretch here. The opening credits sequence is a 5 minute long tracking shot with no cuts and introduces all the central characters, and the dog-fight in space between The Alliance ships and the Reavers (I'm not going to spoil them for you) with Serenity stuck in the middle, heralds back to the Rebels / Empire clash at the climax of Return Of The JediIf, like me, you were yearning for a good sci-fi film, and you haven't seen Firefly, you can still enjoy Serenity. It may even inspire you to get the DVD box-set of Firefly (I did) and get to know the characters even better. 2 central characters die in the film and even though I hadn't seen the series, I still cared when they went. Now that I have seen Firefly too, I am even more saddened by their departure.Will there be more? Well, part of me hopes so, because I enjoyed my time on Serenity so much, but a larger part hopes not, because after this, the mysteries that went unsolved are all the richer for that! All Hail Joss Whedon, The New George Lucas. Use the characters to tell the story, not the computers!",Serenity
506,StrayLiteFocus,Well Done!,8,8 October 2005,"Well Done! A good story with interesting characters engaged in vibrant dialog. The film features an excellent, well-paced mixture of action, humor and loss. It is sometimes tense, sometimes sad and often humorous... very well done. My only problem was with a scene where part of the dialog was missing.I am not sure if this was a problem with my local theater's copy of the film or a case of bad editing. The scene with the problem involves a verbal judo match between Mal and Jayne. Jayne asks war veteran Mal how many people survived from his apparently doomed patrol in his war days. The camera moves to Zoe and her lips move but there is no sound.",Serenity
507,kingmattress,Firefly fans... You'll be blown away,10,2 October 2005,"This is the greatest sci-fi film I have ever seen. It's superior to others in every way. It's plot is grounded, it has a purpose and the things to make the purpose happen occur logically. The battle have serious payoffs, and one space battle goes on to kick and space battle I've seen in Star Wars to hell. It leaves no loose ends untied. This move excited me, made me laugh, and what NEVER happens to me in movies, made me even cry. Serenity takes place a few months after Firefly. Book and Inara are no longer on the ship, but still get back together with the crew. River's going super nuts, and suddenly, reasons start showing up finally about why and the extents the Alliance is going through to get them. Some deep conspiracy stuff shows up, and it's all good. I'm a bit biased, but even non-Firefly fans can enjoy this movie. I went with a guy who never saw it but loved it. If you liked the show, you don't need the comics to bridge the gap. I sure didn't. It's still amazing, and it was truly tragic to see some of the characters I've grown connected to, to love... Not everyone makes it out. I don't know how much sense I just made, I'm on my sleeping pills, but this was too exciting for me to not tell. Go see Serenity.",Serenity

""Serenity"" delivers thrilling F/X and a good, dense storyline. Plus a fast pace that leaves you afraid to take your eyes off the picture for even a second. Amazing that you can actually have a good story AND good effects! I also loved the texture of this film. It was futuristic, yet it felt like a good ol' western. A more realistic vision of the future, since some of it looks familiar. Worn and dusty, with touches of the Orient.The characters may remind you of Star Wars, back when it was new and exciting. (Not just something we felt obligated to go see, loathe to admit it had lost its luster.) Well, this set of characters and the war they're fighting is brand new and ready to sweep you off your feet. Hans Solo for the Twenty-first Century. You'll love the protagonist. Complicated with enough flaws to be real, yet a person who raises to the nobility of sacrifice for the greater good. And the heroine--the mysterious, volatile River... what a great kick butt (and kick everything else in range) girl. I liked all the cast. A fun mix. And the visual excitement...

I simply do not understand why those guys are doing what they are doing. It is impossible for me to relate to any character in the film.Maybe it is a film better suited for Star Wars fans. I just cannot understand concepts like swordplay with laser beams. Call me unimaginative or whatever. I just do not see the point of it.The script is full of clichés. The fact is, the characters do not seem humans at all. To me they seem some robots reciting their lines.Maybe it is just me. I don't like those Japanese/Chinese characters flying around everywhere in the film. Is there any purpose other than making their world look weirder and harder to understand.",Serenity
510,domadilla,Bitterly disappointing,1,20 September 2005,"That's it. I've lost all faith in the IMDb users. How did over 3000 users manage to get this film a score of 8.6? I'm guessing most of them were fans of the TV series Firefly - the TV series on which this film is based. I must point out that I have never watched an episode of Firefly, furthermore I don't believe it's ever been aired in the UK (on terrestrial channels). I am of course familiar with Buffy the Vampire Slayer Joss Whedon's most famous creation and whilst I am not a fan of Buffy I do not find the series entirely unwatchable.I attended a preview screening of 'Serenity' yesterday and was anticipating a great spectacle (to justify its audaciously high rating). It started brightly with some fast-paced scenes fading in and out between story lines. However, the film went downhill rapidly after the introduction. The main storyline slowed considerably and in fact became rather basic, and then somewhat stupid. My biggest qualm with this film is the script - it was suffocatingly poor and I must say it made me think I was watching a TV show. The actors (most of whom are relative unknowns) are all terrible and there was not one noteworthy performance.The only redeeming feature was the special effects. Of course all the latest CGI techniques were put into use and the scenes in space are beautifully detailed. However, CGI alone does not make a good film ipso facto just watch any of the new Star Wars atrocities. The characters in this film were cardboard-like and lacked any substance, as did the storyline. The best way to describe this film is simply to brand it as a good Television Movie (damning with faint praise).",Serenity
511,benign_man,A science fiction film with a lot of important social and personal messages,10,17 February 2006,"Reading through the comments by various people one can see that a lot of various aspects of the film both positive and negative have been covered.Of course those who have good feelings about this film are the vast majority.A lot of thousand of people are giving it very good marks.Very unusual that,especially nowadays,for a new film to be so loved and approved and a science fiction film at that! I'd only like to add a few comments that might not have been mentioned.What are its strengths?Of course there are a few weak points but there is no masterpiece without flaws.To my mind it has 2 very ,very strong points.Firstly it gives a message against oppressive universality against a ''new world order''(ring any bells?)against an empire that wants to impose ,to ''meddle'' as River says and limit people's will and freedom.All of us want a peaceful,harmonious society where order will prevail and yet all of us hide a revolutionary deep down inside that awakes every time this ''order'' is in danger of being abused for the sake of some corrupt,power hungry people.In a time when peoples of the world have awoken and are asking for more freedom,democracy,peace and make claims for better living standards for all,this film expresses very fluently the revolutionary in most of us.The second strong point is that apart from all the cast being extremely talented and very well chosen to play their respective roles, they also are very lovable characters and one can't help becoming very fond of them.In fact,as I've talked to most friends who have seen this, they found the series the film is based on profoundly addictive.This series as well as the film have ''huge success'' written all over them and I simply can't imagine the sheer stupidity of the person who decided to discontinue this series against ,as it seems,worldwide approval.It makes me suspicious therefore,that political reasons may be behind this utterly ridiculous,decision.Anyways like the majority of people worldwide I'm thrilled both with the film and the series and I wish the latter started again and lasted for as long as possible.",Serenity

Its because everyone here gives films 10/10 - c'mon, how many 10/10 films have ever been made!Ratings on IMDb are tossed about like anything - totally unrealistic",Serenity
514,terryl2,great movie,10,11 October 2005,"i went into this movie expecting just another sci-fi film and walked out with so much more. my self and two friends i saw the film with all went out and got the box set of firefly (the TV series serenity is based off). this film has a great sense of wit in its humor and can really build up a scenes suspense level (something that was missing through the series of firefly) this is one i say GIVE IT A CHANCE. this one may not be ""your kinda movie"" but just take a look and you will probably enjoy it. as far as the acting goes, almost everyone is amazing. with the exception of river i feel every character was super well developed. (though they all did have a season of television to really fine tune them) rivers character i feel is just to annoying. she is always either screaming in fear or kicking butt. the special effects in the film are very nice to. they are better than the TV series (which had really good graphics for a TV series) but they are not overbearing. all in all i say great writing, great acting, great production, very surprising movie.",Serenity
515,RockStrongo,Cracking Sci-Fi!!!,9,26 October 2005,"This is quite simply the best sci-fi adventure I've seen in years.I have to say that I wasn't a fan of Buffy or Angel, and I've never even seen Firefly, so I was a bit apprehensive that I might not know what the hell was going on, but I need not have worried.The background story was clearly explained, the scenes well paced, the dialogue sharp and witty, the visual effects dazzling, and the action sequences genuinely exciting. There really wasn't a dull moment throughout the two hour running time.I'm 34 years old, but watching this movie on the big screen reminded me of when I was a kid seeing Star Wars for the first time. It really was that good.",Serenity
516,tgincurtin,And the message is.....,10,8 December 2005,"I almost regret giving the full score, it seems pretentious. But I think it's appropriate The rush of messages here is so relevant and timely. It's a rare example of popular fiction that is relevant and entertaining. It threatens to overshoot but it doesn't ever do go over the edge. An antipodean review said that this movie was 'endless referential', which is what we now seem to seem to call anything which comes from someone well read and informed by more enduring themes.The result is a movie which holds, in nearly perfect balance, ideas about the beneficial results of civilisation and community and loyalty. And puts those against ideas about of conformity, control, and ultimately the repression of any form of government or organisation that is bigger and worse than any of its constituents.It might have been inspired by histories of Gettysburg but it points equally to Enron. In that sense it speaks to the ambivalence of everyone who lives in a so called liberal democracy, craving all of its benefits, and its barbarism.",Serenity
517,darktrainfilms,Interesting transition...,10,18 June 2006,"I caught the TV show on DVD after it was can-celled. I like the feel of the story.I am not a huge ""fan"", but I do think that the idea was worthy for a feature film. I have always wanted to see a The Gunslinger (Dark Tower)made into a film. But no luck so far...My brother and I are working on a similar idea called Ronin VS Maverick. http://www.darktrainfilms.com/RVM/roninvsmaverick.htmlI just think that it is cool that a TV show made into a feature length movie was made.Think of all the TV shows that get turned into films years later.This one was made from a can-celled TV show. Think about that. It is rare....",Serenity
518,Utlkn2me,Very disappointing,1,31 March 2008,"No, it's not an 8 out of 10 stars movie. Why? 1 - It's not true to the series. Just because you bring the same characters together and some of the same plot elements, that doesn't equal the same level of quality as the series. Where's the western/cowboy theme? Where's the relaxed banter and genuine feelings of friendship between characters? The series didn't depend on lots of high-powered special effects - unfortunately, they felt the movie needed to, at the expense of everything else. There could have been a better balance of the two.2 - Too many plot holes, too much didn't make sense. For example, I kept thinking, as I saw at least one other reviewer say, how on earth did these vicious, crazy Reavers have the ability to maintain space travel? What was all of this with River - nothing at all concerning her was logical at all? And, at the end, The Operative just told the Alliance troops to ""stand down""? How did he get loose so quickly and why would he let them go? 3 - Not true to your characters. For example, The Operative had the Shepherd and Mr. Universe killed (among many others), but Mal just let him walk away. Why would Mal do that, other than The Operative's potentially being cast in a sequel. The Mal of Firefly wouldn't have.4 - And, if they (or Joss) dreamed of a sequel, why kill off, unnecessarily, two of the best ongoing characters? On the DVD commentary, Joss said that Wash was killed just because somebody needed to die to prove everybody was in jeopardy. Apparently, nobody else got much more than a hangnail from the final gruesome battle. Why bother? And speaking of the final battle, it was so muddled and dark, it was nearly incomprehensible. All I could really distinguish was River's super kung-fu antics, which were somewhat laughable.All in all, not a movie worthy of the Firefly series. Too bad, because I would have enjoyed a series of movies as they did with Star Trek.",Serenity
519,macphersont,"Good sci-fi move, worth seeing amidst the current drought.",8,30 September 2005,"I will start by saying that it wasn't until after I came out of the theater, that I knew this was based on a TV series. That out of the way, it now makes sense why some people were laughing so hard at parts of the movie and ultra shocked in others... they had a history.Don't take this to mean, that if you don't know the back-story, you shouldn't go. I enjoyed this movie immensely. The visuals were great but not overpowering, the acting was catchy and the characters clicked well, and the story moved along at a rapid pace with only one scene that felt over long and contrived.Probably the best ""new"" Sci-Fi movie to come out in a few years. It did not rely on horror to create story line, though there are horrifying scenes and concepts.Unlike those who have rated it a 10, I have to give this an 8. Why? It was not perfect. There was some unnecessary verbiage in areas (which might make more sense to a Firefly viewer), which takes away from this movie in and of itself. The end was a tad cliché, giving away to an obvious sequel, which this movie definitely deserves.",Serenity

The movie is breathtakingly good! And Joss Whedon has some big rocks. He's willing to rip apart his own creation if it'll make a great movie. And I think that is seriously great. I'll see the movie five more times and not be satiated.My wife's reaction to the movie, as a thirty-something mom who loved Signs and Lord of the Rings, but couldn't care less about sci-fi in general, was something like this: ""yeah, it was good. A little too violent. I don't imagine I'd ever see it again, but I'm glad I got to see it once."" I suspect her more level reaction is the reaction most non-geeks will have.So with her rating of 8, and my rating of a perfect 10, we average a 9.",Serenity

When I first heard it was based on the Firefly series I had no want to see it. I never caught the short lived series so I saw no reason. Boy was I shocked. First the characters were terrific, the acting was great, the special effects were good, but the story was the best part. I was amazed at how quickly the characters came to life and had that feeling of a history to them. A great science fiction movie with great characters and a great plot. The people associated with this film deserve to be rewarded for putting out a great movie. Go see it a second time.",Serenity
522,azfad,What was all the fuss about?,2,14 September 2006,"I found this movie to be one of the most depressing cinema experiences i have ever had. That this movie garnered such positive reviews is a sad indictment of the utterly banal nature of much modern American action/SF movies. If this is high quality SF, then Andrey Tarkovsky is a chicken sandwich.In fact 'Serenity' was not cinema at all - like the many atrocious wastes of celluloid you see released every week it was bad TV beefed up to 90 minutes-ish length.In its defense i suppose - its heart was in the right place as an attempt at non-generic Hollywood SF but, it just sadly did not cut it. and for a supposedly humorous piece i did not laugh once during its duration. flat jokes, over-clever unnatural dialogue and lacking in any drama whatsoever - i hope i never have to sit through this one again. I cant believe even Mark Kermode fell for this - sir, you've been had.",Serenity
523,tgrosso,Great Wrap Up to Firefly,10,8 March 2006,"Upon recommendation from a friend, I was told to check out the Firefly series on DVD. I was immediately gripped. This, to me, was a spaceship filled with Han Solo types in the original Star Wars. A series where anything goes! I was left wanting more and Joss Whedon delivered in a big way. Serenity essentially ties up all of the loose ends that were left from Firefly. The only actor I knew about previously was Ron Glass from the Barney Miller series and let me tell you these bunch of no name actors delivered beautifully in this film. The acting is superb, great direction and stunning visuals on a not so big budget. The story goes that super genius River Tam is kidnapped by ""the alliance"" who are trying to create a Utopia of sorts by creating a world without sin. Her brother helps her escape and the alliance is put in full force to try and recapture her. The characters are not moral but you still can not help falling in love with them. A must see but do not see it until you have seen the Firefly series first.",Serenity
524,mr_mcpimpington,Cool Movie,8,22 July 2007,"Now, I've never seen this ""Firefly"" show people are talking about but I just finished watching this movie and I was seriously impressed. You don't need to watch any TV show to enjoy this flick, trust me.The movie's pace was very fluid, with little to no down time or boredom to be found. The acting was actually very believable too (and in some cases, like River Tam's, extraordinary), which took me off guard because the cast of actors isn't all that great to begin with. Somehow they all seemed to pull off career performances at the same time, a sign of a great director.This is easily the most digestible Sci-Fi flick since Star Wars. I'm one who doesn't find Star Trek, Battlestar Gallatica or anything of that nature very appealing ... but this movie can work for a mass market. It's a shame it kind of slide under the radar a bit, at least it did for me until now.Bottom line, cool movie. Great special effects, good acting, above-average script with an edge. What's not to like?",Serenity
525,guirunkaryyk,Serenity now...,10,10 October 2005,"I just got in from seeing Joss Whedon's Serenity, and I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised. I caught a couple of the Firefly episodes when it was on TV, and while I liked them well enough, I was never really what you'd call a big fan (Farscape on the other hand)...Serenity drags you in and actually does what any good movie (or game) does, and that's make you care about the characters. Even if you've never seen a single episode of the show, it stands alone very well, and drops you into the universe so you know what's going on, without actually rehashing on everything that's already happened to the specific crew members in the show.Good stuff, fine dialogue, just-enough-to-be-impressed effects work, and a story (and characters) that's a bit more grey than the usual high-contrast black and white morality you see in far too many of its ilk.It's good watching, so go see it. I may well do so again next weekend...",Serenity

This is a wonderful movie. The dialogs is witty, the special effects are only what is needed (not overshadowing the movie), the plot is compelling and the characters are so real. The movie is accessible for people who have never seen Firefly and an amazing gift for people who have. The storyline answers a couple questions from the series, but still leaves plenty of areas open for future exploration. I hope enough people see this movie that we can have more. I hope this is not the end of our adventures in this 'verse.",Serenity
527,solidsnakeckw,"If you missed this, you are going to regret it.",9,7 May 2012,"First of all, this review contain spoiler for the Firefly series and this movie. And if you haven't watch it, what are you doing reading about it on IMDb, go buy the BluRay and watch it. NOW. GORRAMIT.First of all, the opening to this movie feels different than the story on Firefly. It is very dark and grim. Mal have become somewhat colder than he was on Firefly. The situation is tense and Mal is threatening Simon and River to leave as they prove to be too much a problem. But then the story picks up again when River kick everyone's ass (Awesome job, Summer Glau) after being activated by secret message encoded into a Japanese commercial.I love it when they visit planet Miranda and found out about the PAX virus. From there on until the final credit roll, it was freaking awesome. One of the example being Reavers vs. Alliance, how much more can you ask for? Obviously, Wash's death was really sudden and really sad. I can't believe my eyes when I saw the scene. Poor Zoe. Near the end, there are more ass kicking, including River taking down all the Reavers, Mal one on one fight with the government assassin guy.Overall, the production value of this movie is really high. CGI looks way better than it was on the TV series. Oh, if only Joss Whedon will make a sequel to this movie. Now in the tradition of Firefly's multicultural background, I'm gonna end this review with a Chinese sentence: 我可以向你保证，这是本世纪最好的科幻片。",Serenity
528,BarkingDoc,A New Outing For The Extraordinary Whedon,10,21 October 2005,"Much like the TV series Firefly, the movie Serenity is a beautiful and soulful science fiction creation which takes many of the clichés of Sci-Fi and presents them through the unique eye of genre-fic genius Joss Whedon. Whedon is well on his way to becoming one of the greatest creative voices of our generation, a visionary equal to Stan Lee and Gene Roddenberry--- not just a clever writer, but also a powerful voice unique to his era. The movie is funny, touching, visually compelling, and although the plot does get a little too ambitious for its own good, the payoff is strong and will leave you feeling inspired. Firefly and Serenity are very different creations, even though they have the same characters. Both are well worth more than one viewing.",Serenity
529,Hardryv,An Emotional Fan Ride,10,8 December 2005,"If you haven't watched Firefly, I HIGHLY recommend doing that first and coming back to these comments. I personally feel the movie's introduction to the universe of Firefly was not adequate to educate unfamiliar viewers about the universe of Firefly. Also, Joss' work doesn't appeal to everyone no matter how much the fans praise his works. Entertainment that hooks me instantly may not work for you.Watching the series will give you important background info as well as character histories. It will also tell you whether or not you should watch the movie at all. There have been many negative comments about this movie, and I'm sure the reason stems from distaste for Joss-style work and/or lack of series knowledge. Detractors either seem to 'not get it' or are after a different kind of entertainment for their movie dollar. A high rating doesn't mean a movie is good, only that it was appreciated.If you disliked the series, you won't go see this anyhow. No worries.If you are a so-so fan of the series, most of the people I know that are fans of the series loved the movie immensely, so it might be worth your time.If you enjoyed the series, then it's simply a must-see film.- -It's relevant for me to state that the TV series Firefly is currently my all-time favorite. I'm still catching up on The West Wing though :P.This movie was a very special emotional experience for me in pretty much every aspect... plot, action sequences, character interactions & performances, special effects... even the very fact that fans like me basically bankrolled it's existence with our purchases of the series DVDs.My only personal complaint is that it was decided to have noises in space, unlike the series. I hope a Director's Cut edition returns us to the series method... using only a musical score and dramatic CG on the space clips. This is a very small complaint though, and most theater-goers want space sequences to have associated audio.I had uncharacteristically high expectations for this particular movie walking in, and I'm glad to say that they were met and exceeded. I predicted an 8, and it got a rare 9 out of me.",Serenity
530,kari_d,"Watch ""Firefly"" first to really appreciate it!",8,21 July 2006,"My husband and I first saw this movie after just reading these excellent reviews and not knowing anything else about the movie or characters. We are both sci-fi fans.I must say, we were a little puzzled about the great reviews. We thought the one-liners were kind of cheesy, the acting a bit poor, and we weren't at all impressed (except for maybe the fight scenes with River). The cowboy theme music didn't sit well with us either.However, I have heard only excellent things about the series Firefly and the following movie Serenity. Were we missing something? We even watched Serenity again giving it a second chance. It still didn't click with us. I was very confused.We were going to give up when a friend loaned us the Firefly DVDs. OK, I'll give it another shot since clearly we *must* be missing something! And that did it.After just a couple episodes I was really enjoying myself. When I re-watched Serenity again after seeing the TV series, I thought it was excellent. I really appreciated it. The characters were more 3D, the one-liners were amusing, the music didn't bother me a bit (I was starting to like it), and I really liked all the nuances from the actors (I changed my mind - not bad acting). I felt like I knew the characters and story so much better and I really loved how they tied some loose ends together. It was also nice to see the characters again after the series ended (even on DVD).So bottom line - if you didn't watch Firefly, you probably won't get it, may not like it very much, and you might be confused why there are such great reviews. If you did watch Firefly first (and liked it), you'll love Serenity and you'll have a great ride!",Serenity
531,sexy_dancer,"Perfect for fans, not sure about anyone else",9,22 September 2005,"I saw a screening of this movie the other day, and loved it. It was a real roller-coaster, both putting the audience through the emotional wringer and thrilling us with great action scenes. to top it all off, it wraps up the TV show it is spun off from, Firefly, in a more satisfying manner than I would have expected in a mere two hours.People who haven't followed the entire series (in its far-too-short original incarnation) could possibly get lost, and would have nowhere near the same attachment to the characters. No real problem there - just see the series first, it's on DVD, and it's a cracking good character-driven horse/space opera.Character arcs continue from the show. The performances are all superb, especially Nathan Follion as Mal, Summer Glau as River, and (my personal favourite) Alan Tudyk as Wash. The mixture of humour, tension and adventure is still present, though the stakes are even higher and the drama is more poignant.I am deliberately not telling you anything about the plot. More than most movies, that is for you to discover as you watch it. I give the movie 10/10 for fans and 8/10 for non-fans, arriving at a mean average of 8/10. Don't miss it.",Serenity

My brother was a fan of the series and he reminded me for months via e-mail that the movie was coming out. In deference to his taste, I went opening night. I was not disappointed.It was fantastic. Somehow they managed to make a movie after a series that completely stands alone - and yet still manages to augment the series it came from. It is a work of art.The challenge: How can you make a two hour flick that simultaneously engages, informs, absorbs and entertains the first-time viewer as well as totally sating the hard core series fan - and do it without using narrative drivel, trite flashbacks or forced dialog alluding to the past. I am in awe.The script crackles, the effects soar, the direction and cinematography are artful without being self-conscious and the acting is surprising in both range and depth. Inside of its own universe it is a fully realized sci-fi flick of the first order, both intimate and epic at the same time.Catch it on the big screen if you can - the small screen if you can't - but catch it.I'll see it again.8",Serenity

Boy did I miss something back in the day, kinda like catching up with LEXX. I just saw the movie tonight at the theatre, and the movie is plain AWESOME and I hope this will either spawn a sequel of equal value or bring me back a TV show worth watching. The story was strong, the characters lovable an hated at the same time. Fast paced, well shot and from the beginning sucks you right in. I dare say anything more than ""GO SEE THE BEST SCIFI FLICK OF THE YEAR,"" for telling you about the movie won't do it justice. A definite thrill ride that any age can enjoy, most interested to get on DVD so I can see it again. Take anyone they will enjoy a straight up out of the box movie that will leave you wanting more.

535,CrazyBomber,The best Sci-fi/adventure film in years,10,21 December 2005,"Where to begin? Well, I never heard of this movie until it actually came to the local theater. A friend of mine told me he had heard some good comments about it. So, I went to see it. After all, being a fan of Star Trek, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Terminator, and pretty much all the good Sci-fi ever produced, I felt it was my duty to check this one out......and it changed me. Not the movie, though. I thought the movie was nice. I would give it perhaps an 8 out of 10. The characters were all there, the action was good, the story was very interesting too, but it just didn't seem deep enough for just one movie. I felt like I was missing something. So I went to find out what it was. As it turned out, the movie was the offspring of a canceled TV series. ""Well, the internet is a big place, I'm sure I can find it somewhere"", I thought.So when I got it, I was hooked on the first 5 episodes. Then devoured all the rest in an evening show-down. The last episodes particularly touched me. That was it. That was what I had missed from the movie. The characters were so well connected. Their relationships seemed so true, so honest. The sight of adventure was so compelling. I honestly never thought I could feel that much for them. It was... perfect.Then, I went to see the movie for the second time. It was all there. All the tiny bits that made the relationships so special. It just wasn't so easy to spot, if you weren't looking for them.Well, bottom line is... I'm as deeply in love with this Series/movie as much as one can possibly love a motion picture.I am now a fully-committed fan, digging up every bit of information I can get about the characters, the story, the directors, etc. I check this page at least once a day, really.I now have no other choice than to rate this movie a classic, a master-piece. It really touched me. It's perfect.10/10EDITED: As of today, the Firefly DVD is still sold out at all the local re-sellers.

I read several reviews saying this movie is good, but i was still somewhat sceptical. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed it!! This could very well be the best sci fi movie since recent years (Though there weren't many sci fi movies recently to begin with).The characters in the movie give a huge degree of life into the movie. From the humour, the plot, the crew personalities, right down to the action - there isn't a single dull moment in Serenity. This may be a science fiction movie, but the special thing about the movie is that it brings everyday problems we face today, set in a futuristic world (without aliens!), blurring the notion between right and wrong, good and evil - it's all about survival.Suffice to say, anyone can enjoy this movie, whether you're a fan of science fiction or not. Highly recommended!",Serenity
537,RunningD,Great movie,9,3 October 2005,"I had missed the series, like a lot of people I guess. But a friend had the DVD set he loaned it to me one weekend. From the first few minutes I knew my day was shot. I was going to sit through the entire series. I truly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone, even those who are unsure of the science fiction genre.Went to the movie over the weekend, and it was everything I hoped for and MORE! It has been a long time sine a movie drew me into it as much as this one did. It was nice to see the characters again, like finding old friends. The story was sharp and well written as we have come to expect, the special effects were awesome. Those who have not seen the series you can still go and enjoy it as well. The first 10 or so minutes give enough of the back story (and well done I might add) so you can move forward with the film.Defiantly a must see!",Serenity
538,Nightchild7,A great Sci-Fi film that anyone can enjoy.,8,14 November 2005,"Serenity is a great film that should be seen in the same league as the Star Wars films. Heavy on dialog with some great action and set pieces, the film is an enjoyable romp nonetheless.I also liked that it is not too serious and dark. The film does have a dark atmosphere but it is lighthearted and fun with fast action and genuine character development. And did I forget to mention the hot girls in this film? Some nitpicks: A little more action and info on some of the characters, namely the savage beings that attack our heroes and how the earth became desolated and uninhabitable. But I still liked it and will likely see it again.Serenity is great and charismatic at the same time; never too dark and never too funny. A nice balance of story, action, and humor. All in all, makes a nice complete package.",Serenity
539,Bo16,Take my love...Take my land...,10,11 April 2007,"Let's look at what Serenity is. It's a sci-fi film. First, let me start with a lecture. If you don't want to read, just skip this paragraph. Science Fiction is such a popular subject because it's the biggest genre going. There is no such film as just Science Fiction. For example: Star Wars? Sci-Fi/Fantasy. Blade Runner? Sci-Fi/Drama/Thriller.Serenity? Sci-Fi/Action/Adventure/Thriller with elements of comedy. See the pattern? Sci-Fi is broad and I personally think that Serenity is a perfect example of this.Because nowadays CG is a big problem in Hollywood, I'm going to address it first. Many people believe it's used far too much. Given the most recent films considered by the public to be Science-Fiction, the computer animation within Serenity is surprisingly kept to a minimum. CG is used only where it is going to be helpful towards the plot, as opposed to remarkably pointless scenes that show off the tech. Hell, there's even a scene that uses models but it looks great. Generally the entirety of the film is remarkably pretty. Not only is the CG used well but the cinematography is absolutely superb. The lighting delivers something that not even the greatest porno on earth could deliver (and that's good). All in all: this is a pretty film.The plot in itself isn't really anything particularly new. Generally it's a continuation of the Firefly plot. But don't let that put you off. It's generally explained to you through the characters conversations (a really good plot device. within Serenity). Adding to that is something I love about this flick. The way characters talk. You have to realise that Serenity is set 500 years in the future and so people speak differently. This different way of speaking means that there are many simple yet endlessly quotable lines throughout the whole film (""We might experience some slight turbulence and then...explode."") But as I was saying about the plot. Not overtly original but the way that the plot fits into the 'verse is an incredible thing to watch. It's not totally dissimilar to how J.R.R Tolkein made sure that every aspect of The Lord of the Rings fit into the grand scheme of Middle Earth.Much of the film feels very old, but it almost seems as if this is the point. Serenity (the ship within the film) is an old heap of junk that should be collapsing and so it seems like Serenity (the film itself) should fall apart at any minute. It's strange to realise that nothing within the film feels new because it isn't supposed to.Just a final few words before I come to my quick snappy synopsis, if you don't like Serenity the first time, I advise you watch it again. At first I wasn't a big fan but now it's one of my favourite films. Just give i a couple of viewings and see if anything sticks. Oh and don't forget to watch Firefly, the show Serenity is based on and is a sequel to.So, final message? Serenity is a funny, depressing, action packed, space drama that deserves a few viewings before a final judgement is passed. Check it out. And Firefly, too.",Serenity

It will take you on a ride where you will laugh and cry and gasp and leave feeling totally exhilarated. This is pure aural and visual Ecstasy. This is everything a Firefly fan is expecting to the Power of 10. It is bigger, slicker, funnier, faster and smarter than Firefly and many of your questions will be answered.

This film had absolutely no cinematic qualities & had no place being shown in the cinema. You could see it trying desperately to attain a depth in its themes & ideas that it wasn't able to pull off. What complexity? What intelligence? The whole thing had a TV movie of the week quality to it; generic, bland characters, plot lines & ideas rehashed from other sci-fi TV shows, & nondescript action scenes. It appears that this tongue in cheek genre fusion approach to the material is all a part of the appeal, like Buffy, another of Whedon's mediocre shows. There is nothing new, no variations on old themes, no originality, no insight, nothing of worth that Serenity offers. We've seen this all before, & done better. I suspect that in light of the recent disappointing Star Wars trilogy, people are desperate for something to fill the sci-fi void with. Well this isn't it. I have to say it's pretty discouraging to read so many glowing reviews of this amateur effort. It does a disservice to real sci-fi films that have been made by people with real visions & something valuable to say. This is kiddie stuff by comparison, made by an adolescent, for adolescents. People who say they went through all the emotions on this one must have a pretty limited range, & haven't seen too many films in general. When generic, TV quality sci-fi films like this are being touted as the best cinematic experience of the year, or even put into the same category as great sci-fi like Blade Runner, Alien, the Empire Strikes Back, 2001, it's a sad day for the cinema. Serenity never rises to any great cinematic heights, not once, like any of these films. Open your eyes a little bit more people, do your research, see a few more films before praising mediocrity so mindlessly. Wake up! This belongs on TV.",Serenity
542,Hopper-2,The end of the line,10,10 October 2005,"This review is aimed at fans of Firefly, the television show that this movie is based on. If you didn't watch the show, you probably won't get anything out of this review. I will simply say that you will enjoy this movie. It portrays a realistic possible future and is full of action, violence and suspense. The story is compelling, and has some scary moments as well. It will be a great adrenaline rush.If you are a fan of Firefly, you'll have to see the movie, but it will be difficult to watch. Many of the unanswered questions will finally be explained. You'll gain a new perspective on the show and Joss Whedon's vision, but you may have trouble ever watching the show again once you know how the story ends. I am including two levels of spoiler warning so that you can decide how much you want to know.*** SPOILER WARNING: MEDIUM *** No plot information, but information about the characters.Some of the main characters die, and it's not easy to watch. I've heard rumours that there will be two more movies, and maybe there will be. In an age full of television shows that shouldn't be made, a growing number of excellent shows are being cancelled prematurely. Firefly was barely given a chance, but it is gaining a cult following through syndication and a DVD release of the entire series. Family Guy, another FOX show, successfully returned to the airwaves, and I had hoped that the success of the DVDs and movie would lead to new episodes of Firefly. How can it ever be a show again without all of the crew? I don't think Joss Whedon intends his creation to ever be a television show again.The information in the next spoiler explains my point in greater detail and mentions characters specifically. I recommend only reading it if you have already seen the movie.*** SPOILER WARNING: HIGH *** Individual characters discussedWhenever a television show becomes a movie, the need for action means that some characters are underused, or aren't free to be what they normally are. Firefly was full of thought and humour, and much of it came from Inara's work as a companion. Serenity is an action movie, so Inara's character suffers. There's no time to go off on her own to entertain clients. That means the feel of the story is entirely different. This is not an episode of Firefly.Shepherd Book and Wash die in this movie. To see the most gentle and positive characters die will be very difficult for any fan. You can understand why I say that Firefly can't return to television now. Book is the moral center for the crew. Without him, they really are just thieves. Wash is the counter-balance to Zoe and Mal. He is the comic relief; the man who plays with toy dinosaurs on the bridge of a space ship. He's not a soldier; not a fighter. He allows Zoe to be feminine and creates sympathy for the crew. Without these two characters, Kaylee is the only lighter character left. The characters who remain are the soldiers, the mercenary, the psychic killing machine and the prostitute. I don't say this to be hard on the surviving characters. Each one filled an important role when they made up a whole. They represent the best and worst sides of humanity. Without Book and Wash, the picture is incomplete. They don't complement each other any more. You can't turn this franchise into anything more than an action movie without replacing them. I no longer expect new episodes, and I worry about what sort of stories might be created for the next two movies.When the movie ended, no one stuck around to watch the credits. I was left full of sadness and disappointment. Normally a movie ends with an uplifting victory that carries you happily into the night. All I could think about was, ""why did these characters die?"", and getting home to write this review. If you've read this, you still need to see the movie. Just be prepared to be saddened by what you see.",Serenity
543,nevenbartel,I don't understand the hype,4,29 November 2005,"I used to be able to go to the movies by blindly trusting IMDb-ratings... until I went and watched Serenity. I don't understand the hype and I don't understand the positive ratings.The movie is an attempt of mixing ""Star Wars"", ""Resident Evil"" and ""Kill Bill"". And it is a poor attempt.This is one of the worst Sci-Fi Movies I have ever seen - there is no feasible plot and horrible acting. Fair special effects just save the movie from being worse than AvP. Don't waste your money, go watch ""Harry Potter"" or ""Merry Christmas"" or rent ""Alien""... you will be a happier person.",Serenity
544,aly-5,Best Ever Movie? Not Quite,5,1 October 2005,"Some shows do not transfer well from small screen to big. However, Joss Whedon's Serenity stood on it's own. A gritty no-nonsense crew with enough flash backs to allow the novice viewer time to play catch up. ***Spoilers***Inara (Morena Baccarin) has returned to the Companion Training House, Shepherd Book (Ron Glass) is residing on Haven and River (Summer Glau) is deteriorating, though she has glimmers of lucidity, enough so Mal (Nathan Fillion) can take her on raiding missions to use as a water witch to divine the liars from the truth tellers. I did like how they fleshed out the story more, showing how Simon (Sean Maher) was able to escape with River from the Alliance facility. They had more budget for sceneries (expanding the views in the ship), better CGI, etc. The story of how the Reavers came to be was well told by Sarah Paulson as an Alliance- uniformed hologram, explaining how they added ""Pax"" - G-32 paxilon hydrochlorate to the air processors to cause docility in the inhabitants of the world. Trouble is, they became so submissive that they just laid down and died. Except for the 10% who had an adverse reaction to the Pax and went ape crazy, becoming the cannibalistic Reavers.There was an antagonist (of course) The Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) not as psychotic as Jubal Early (Richard Brooks), but intent and focused on his cause of getting River back. The shocker of the movie is that they kill Zoe's husband, Wash (Alan Tudyk) off. Impaled by a harpoon. It was a death on par with Kate in NCIS. Unexpected and, I suppose, necessary. Oh and, they killed off Book.If you've never seen Firefly, you will be lost. You need to buy/rent the short season to get up to speed or you will be sitting there wondering where the hell Buffy is. Just cause it's Joss Whedon, doesn't mean that it's all the same. The problem is, Firefly was only on for a year, three years ago. 13 episodes, kept alive by the thousands of DVDs sent to the troops in Iraq and by fans of Joss here in the states and around the world. But, somehow, he'll have to keep the fans satisfied and I am wondering how he will accomplish it. I never saw any of his BTVS, though fell in love with Firefly due to the Old West aura and dialog being coupled with space.In Serenity, the dialog is crisp, the actors retain their wonderful camaraderie, the cinematography more TV-like than movie-like and finally, finally, Simon grows a set and gets jiggy with Kaylee. Now that there is no more Star Wars or Star Trek coming down the pike (well, SW TV program at some point), we have Battlestar Galactica to satisfy our cravings. I suppose at some point, we will have another Serenity movie, but the viewing audiences are a fickle lot and I don't think they'll settle for a movie every two or three years. I hope they make lots of money on the movie, but I still have to confess, I liked the immediate satisfaction of a weekly show. I have a feeling the phrase, ""I aim to misbehave"" will become a suitable catch- phrase for many. I'll see it again, just to see if I missed anything. But it didn't make me catch my breath like ""Batman Begins"" did nor make me wait impatiently for the next episode like BSG does. (Damn if it's not on now again until January!!) I hope that they will be able to sustain the interest for Serenity and not just have this to cap a series that was taken off too soon. Like Farscape was (the bastards). I have to say that the special effects were clumsy, choppy and looked cut-rate.I wish it would be put back on television.",Serenity
545,dwd9510,The best Sci-Fi Movie there is,10,4 April 2006,"My favourite film of all time. Joss Whedon has created the best sci-fi film in years. Better than Star Wars and Star Trek, it has been hailed as the new Star Trek and Star Wars. Hope the sequels are as good as this one. Firefly, (the TV Series on which this is based is equally good and should never have been cancelled. The suits at Fox should be fired.For all those who wish to see a great sci-fi movie, see this.It may not have a big budget or a major cast but in their own way, this is the movie that everyone will enjoy.Rating 10 out of 10",Serenity
546,magicwalnuts,Excellent Movie,10,22 October 2007,"Firefly was an excellent show, it had good characters, good story, and great acting, all put into a sci-fi setting. For nerds the setting was a huge attraction, but for most people it was a big turnoff.Serenity follows the same vein, with an even tighter story and some flashy special effects. It is not entirely necessary to watch the show before the movie (I didn't) but there are a few dramatic notes that are missed without previous knowledge (particularly concerning the captain).It's a shame this movie didn't do better in theaters because it truly is a gem.",Serenity
547,Laurie-27,Very entertaining,8,1 October 2005,"I love Firefly. I love the world created in Firefly. I liked Serenity. I liked it a whole lot. I can't say what the movie would be like for someone uninitiated with this world and these characters. I found the movie funny, exciting, touching, scary. The only real problems that I had with the film are the subtle differences from the TV show. The random Joe off the street will not be disappointed because the chairs in the common room and the operating bed in the infirmary are different. The average Jane will not care that the galley suddenly has a pantry or that the bridge is missing a big red button. I was and I did. Other than those complaints (and the under-use of Ron Glass), it was a joy long coming to see this world again.",Serenity
548,wizard-man,Heisei,9,3 October 2005,"Heisei means ""serenity"" in Japanese, but peace and quiet is definitely something missing on the deck of the title Firefly-class ship, which, just as the lives of its passengers, seems to be mysteriously held together in spite of the bumps, bruises, and conflicts it goes through.Serenity, like many space sagas before it such as Star Trek or Farscape follows the adventures of its crew. However, unlike Star Trek (specifically TNG), Mal Roberts is an outspoken leader of a somewhat less glamorous band of smugglers/outlaws/fugitives, who walks a very thin line between being a criminal and a folk hero in his actions and moral choices. Captain Roberts is a complex character of firmness, honor, compassion and opportunism, struggling to do good in a bad place. Sometimes it's difficult to grasp his choices at first but eventually a very admirable underlining principle shows in each decision he makes. In fact, most characters on his ship have multiple dimensions to them and that is EXACTLY what makes this movie and the FOX TV show it is based on so very entertaining. The right and wrong is much less obvious when floating on the fringes of space ...The bottom line is that if you like Sci-Fi, you'll fall in love with this movie. In fact, I liked it so much that I got the complete series of ""Firefly"" on DVD and watched them non-stop. It is SO good.Character is the one ingredient missing from so many shows on the airwaves these days. Strangely, the one show that has plenty of it got prematurely canceled. Why? God only knows. Now, do yourself a favor and see it, maybe we'll help to bring it back.",Serenity
549,christian-356,Han Solo meets River Maxtrix is anything but Serenity,6,13 January 2007,"I have seen that some people have rated this movie a 10 out of 10. It has made me think that maybe you have to be a fan of the series to really be a good reviewer of this movie. I never knew there was a series before reading the reviews here. Am I disqualified? 10 out of 10? This movie comes across somewhat as a quilt or patchwork, especially in the beginning of the movie, with the River dream sequence and the shifts in time. This continues somewhat, however it's nice to know that although you may not get the feeling that you really know where you are, who you see, or what's going on, you get back to the characters at a later point. There's consistency in that respect. River, a psychotic girl, escapes from what appears to be a research lab somewhere in the universe, aided by her brother, a young doctor. Black Guy, a government MIB, kills the head of the research lab, and now wants to kill River. She knows too much. Han Solo, now all matured and solemn, flies around without measure, they will have us believe. For unknown reasons, the young doctor and his sister are on Han Solo's ship. And for inexplicable reasons, Han Solo and his crew let them stay, although they are wanted by the authorities. And so it continues. Another reviewer, Manosdvd whom, among others, rated it 10 out of 10, gave the this description: ""There's no grand theme or clear cut good and evil. There's just a band of fugitives trying to make their way in a dangerous sky. It's something folks can relate to, [...] The point of the name Serenity is the name of the ship, though in a deeper sense that's what our characters are in search of. Finding freedom and a home, and that's what the ship represents to them, and to the fans.""I simply have to comment on Manosdvd's review. I really doubt that ordinary people like myself can relate to being fugitive. Indeed, there is no grand theme in Serenity, that much is true. There is hardly the theme that Manosdvd describes. The characters are not really looking for a place to settle down. Come on. They are simply not motivated. And there is no serenity in the movie, which makes it in a sense a bad title. Pros: Likable charactersLikable actors Nice effects Believable action, except perhaps for the River action sequences.Cons: There are too few distinct personalities. There's Tough Guy (Han Solo/Black Guy), there's Psychotic/Hidden Dragon Karate Girl (River), and there's Trusted Assistant, tough but not as tough as tough guy (Everybody else). The woolly speeches given by Han Solo, with a voice like Thorne Forrester (the Bold and the Beautiful), and the looks of Eric 'Rick' Forrester, and the empty, homespun philosophies for content, it's too much to bear. The characters' actions are not motivated. None of the characters are build up. We don't really know anybody and never know what to expect of them. Blunders:In the scene with the dying old reverend, getting the doctor to come takes an exorbitant amount of time. They've all just stepped outside the Serenity, he can't be that far away and the only reason must be, that the director wants the old man dead. When Han Solo's girlfriend joins the Serenity, it is most surprising that nobody on the ship has any spare clothes for her. Not even a boiler suit. She is compelled to go on adventure in her décolleté evening gown. When River points out the planet Miranda to Han Solo, the reason for them to decide to go there is really not substantiated. Throughout the movie, Black Guy, the government emissary, never reports back to the government. The government is never seen although it is so important for the storyline. It becomes just a word.Black Guy uses an old school Bruce Lee karate trick to paralyze his victims: He forces his hand into the right side of the lower back of his victim. Everybody knows that the correct area is the neck.",Serenity
550,spindizzy,Wow ! Surprisingly good - nice work fellas.,10,22 October 2005,"This was a delight - easily the best SF film I've seen in years, with characters I cared about, brilliant effects and an interesting vision of the future as a backdrop for the adventure. Loved the sly humour too! Later I found the connection with the original series Firefly (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/combined ) and borrowed a copy - watching this is highly recommended but it's a bittersweet pleasure as it was cancelled after very few episodes by someone who *must* need their head examined...I've bought the Firefly DVD and will definitely watch it (and Serenity) again in the future, but I urge you to see this movie while it's on the big screen :-)",Serenity
551,Platymania,"Finally, Sci-Fi that doesn't suck",10,9 September 2005,"There has been a drought of good Sci-Fi these past few years, as evidenced by the fact that Star Wars Episode 3 (characterised by poor dialogue and shoddy acting) was relatively well received by a public hungry for Sci-Fi which doesn't suck.Now we have a Sci-Fi film which gets it all right: Serenity. With crisp, witty dialogue, gorgeous visuals, engaging characters and a strong plot, Serenity is a wakeup call to the film industry. It is fun, action-packed, scary, emotionally engaging (without being sentimental or sappy) and it keeps on *surprising* you. Clichés are turned upside down and jokes are made at the most inappropriate of times. The audience I saw this movie with at the Advanced Screening laughed, gasped and cried right through the film and applauded as the ending credits rolled.Fans of Firefly will be delighted to see their much-loved characters return, but you don't need to have seen the original series to enjoy Serenity (it will add to the experience though). See it if you enjoy action, adventure or just great dialogue.",Serenity
552,donbigbullet,How did this ever get an average of 8.0 ????,5,22 September 2009,"Im in shock. I read a few of the praising reviews and bought this for my friends boy at the age of 13. Watching the first episode together was actually one of my greatest disappointments this year regarding films/TV-series.When people rate, they obviously rate from whether or not you're are a fan or not. 10 if you are and 0 if you're not...Instead try too break down the film into different bits and see how well they work on their own and together. Now i will try to do this as fair as possible: The visuals are nice and somewhat very good for a TV-series.This almost the only positive thing i can find about this. As for the acting, it ranges from average to very amateuristic, and the characters have as well little to no dept.This is fatal since this is the main reason to follow different episodes of a TV-series. Worst is the complete lack of relatable dilemmas of which the characters go through, combined with a very hip but often uninteresting script.If you're able to bore a 13 year old sci-fi fanatic with what others praise as (Due to the rating, compared to other shows) one of the best sci-fi series of newer date, something is wrong. Please rate fair from the quality of the content and less from emotional attachments from being a fan, OK ? My rating is based on the partial nice visuals, where i otherwise would have given only a 3/10. Sorry",Serenity
553,Windywoo,Pretty much all you could want from their big screen outing.,9,24 August 2005,"I've just seen this film at its World Premier in Edinburgh so does that make me the first person to see the final version and post a comment? Hope so.Anyway, if you are a fan of the series I don't think you are going to be disappointed by this. The cancellation left so many plot points and characters undeveloped and, while there are still mysteries, a lot of untapped stuff is brought out on the big screen to dazzling effect.River in particular is used brilliantly and is pretty much the centre of the story, which makes up for her under use in the series. A previously unresolved romance also comes to fruition in this film, bringing romance AND comedy at the same time.Also this is being the crew's possibly last chance at getting any screen time, they are given a suitably tough challenge to face and end up sandwiched between their two biggest foes. Thats right Reavers make an appearance after being only hinted at for so long in the TV series. This made me dead chuffed.Why doesn't this get 10? Because good as it is, not all characters really get enough to do. This of course is an almost impossible thing to achieve within the time frame, but non-fans of the series may well wonder why all the people are there.About the premier, the cast was there (except Wash, dunno why he wasn't there) along with Joss Whedon and the producer. The fan questions were suitably geeky, highlights being Joss Whedon being asked to do his dance of joy from Angel (he turned down pleeing knee surgery but Nathan Fillion obliged. Then there was a singalong of the theme tune (left out of the film but I didn't care because I didn't like it). Each crew member had to give their favourite moment from the film and their taste probably was spot on, picking the highlights of the film.Recommended for fans and for non-fans too, although I think if you don't like Sci Fi in any form this will not convert you :)",Serenity
554,nvserv,Wow!,10,30 September 2005,"Just an amazing film.I saw a midnight showing on opening day, so there were die-hard fans there. I can tell you a great time was had by all. It reminded me of the bubbly energy at the Star Wars sequels, where I did the midnight movie thing for Empire and Jedi...The actors did a fantastic job. They know their characters well. Whedon has done stellar work here. I'm just tickled that Universal was willing to take a chance on a show that was canceled (after a seriously botched short run as a series - all blame to the network for that fiasco).As a previous poster said, you'll end up experiencing all your emotions with this one. These are the movies I most enjoy.Overall, it's one big exciting roller-coaster, and you'll find yourself wanting to get back in line once its over.",Serenity
555,sacul1138,The Little Firefly that Could or Serenity Now! (Spoiler free),9,8 September 2005,"When FOX announced a new Sci Fi series by Joss Weadon I was naturally curious. Science Fiction shows are few and fewer still are any good, however this was from the guy who put Buffy on the TV map and help write Toy Story so it at the very least had someone behind the controls who had talent with characters and plotting. But could this show be any good? The answer for me was a long time coming but...turn out to be yes and like the rest of the fans I've been waiting for this movie to get back on board with the crew of Serenity. Last night thanks to the Sacramento Browncoats I got my wish for more time on-board with the crew of Serenity, and Gorram! It was glorious! What could have been just an extended episode dry hump of the show became a living breathing entity all its own. This movie could exist without the show easily, the crew is introduced quickly and the world of Firefly is laid out with very little effort; you meet your anti hero's, you learn there's a evil empire, then you meet the boggy men of this universe. The plot rolls out much like it would on the show or in one of Joss's issues of X-men; The story begins with some key elements to get things going after which things move along at a brisk pace with a slight but acceptable lag in the middle of the story. The story is very straight forward in most respects. The crew is on the clock from jump and it's not long before the fun and terror begins. The Alliance (evil empire) has their top assassin on the case to search for their runaway experiment (River), a man of simplified evil he's not only cunning and lethal but a zealot in the belief the Alliance way is the right way. He's employed methods are some of the most creative evil doer works seen on the screen in quite some time. He's not just a man with a vast fleet or some awe inspiring new super weapon to bring people to their knees, his tactics are methodical and brutal. The crew spends most of their time running once it begins. They have no secret base, no rebel armies' ready to back them up; they are alone in the universe. The entire plot builds to a head when the crew decides that the time for running is over and start looking for the means to fight back. The story completely shifts gears and you see the change in each of them that a breaking point has been hit and that there some things worth fighting and dying for. The thrill of the crew going on the offensive is a treat; each one of these characters gets to shine as it all boils over. There are some really jarring moments in this movie, and it's very in line with the show. People get hurt, hero's have their asses handed to them (a lot) and there is no super fun happy ending where the evil empire is vanquished and everyone gets the girl (or boy) and the medals. Real life in a Sci Fi movie? Who knew? For the fans this movie does answer a few questions and does give you some money shots you might have been looking for. For the newbie's it's just a fun ride and will likely make you search out a copy of the DVD's. The effects are sharp and I can't recall a single distracting moment where the effects popped out and took me out of the movie. It's all very minimal and the effects used sparingly. A nice change of pace from the other effects heavy films in science fiction. The crew/cast has a ton of charm and talent among them. Everyone has a real character and a real purpose (small or large) to them. When I say that I don't mean you're the engineer so you're helpful when stuff breaks or you're the doctor so you're here when people get shot (and they often do). Everyone fights, everyone busts ass, life is messy, and nothing works out quite the way they plan it. The actors behind them are much the same; Nathan Fillion (Captain Mal) and Summer Glau (River Tam) might not be top fan favorites but these two actors and their characters have the most riding on their shoulders in this movie, and I'm happy to say they both come out shiny in the end. Nathan Fillion's Mal is the man in charge of everything and nothing. He's not suited for a life as a career criminal and it shows. He loves his ship, he loves his crew but he'd push anyone out an airlock if the need calls for it. Summer Glau gets to take River's character to its core (finally) and its impressive how she does it; One minute she's a babbling zombie, the next she's just a quirky girl with issues, blink and she's suddenly got moves that would make Trinity call for the nearest exit. The rest of the cast do a fantastic job of it and are one of the most likable casts your likely to come across. If these people are not friends in real life they deserve awards for how well they work as an ensemble cast. All in all of the handful movies I was most looking forward to this summer this one hit all the marks.",Serenity
556,LtTroy,A True Masterpiece!,10,27 September 2005,"I just got back from an advanced screening of Serenity and I have to say it was well worth the wait. Even if you aren't familiar with Joss Whedon's work or the show Firefly, you will still most likely find something to love about this movie. As usual, Joss provides us with an amazingly thoughtful, creative script on top of top notch performances and it is all perfectly directed. And of course Joss defies convention by throwing a few surprises in for good measure. So throw whatever preconceptions you may have about this movie out the window, and sit back and enjoy one heck of a ride aboard Serenity! No power in the 'verse can stop it!",Serenity
557,beautifulbooks,Fantastic movie.. wish there were more like it.,10,14 January 2010,"I'll keep it simple. Simply fantastic. Hope, courage and honesty. Damn fine. ""I aim to misbehave."" If only more of us would.Well, IMDb wishes me to make certain my review has 10 lines. Okay, movie industry, please learn from this example of a movie and please make more like it. I am now going back and watching the Firefly series which I was unaware of before this past month. What a pleasure. Perhaps it is made even more poignant by the situation we find ourselves in our country and world today. When River's teacher asks her class why anyone wouldn't want to join their alliance, she correctly states ""Because we meddle."" Feels a bit like we are now...realizing we have allowed ourselves to be coddled right into a trap with our government and dependence on subsidy. Anyway, enjoy the movie.",Serenity
558,pisarenco-a,Quite nice and pleasant to watch,8,7 August 2011,"This was the best Sci-fi movie I've seen this year. Can't compete with the legendary movies though. But it was pleasant to watch. The plot is interesting, the twists are there also. Pretty good job at inventing a plausible future, with quite a lot of details.The social aspect of the plot was great. They invented a good post-war society, with many veterans trying to continue living, while many struggle with their past.Ideology/religion also played a role in defining the actions in the movie. So it's not just instinct, money and power which is leading the heroes, but also idealism which is also observed, and felt, by the viewer.A few mistakes with the science stuff, but they are bearable. They've failed to re-create the entity known as 3D space, when in outer space, as well as not having success in some places in representing a planet as a whole planet - not just a village.This movie actually left something pleasant for me to think about afterwords. It also made me notice key aspects when watching it the second time. Yes, it was worth watching it again, but 3 or more times would be too much :).",Serenity
559,UK_Melia,Worth the effort,10,2 October 2005,"When I say Serenity is worth the effort, I mean it was worth me driving 40 miles to the nearest theatre that had it playing. For the record, yes I am a great fan of Firefly and have been looking forward to seeing a new adventure with my beloved crew at least one more time. So that was the reason for the drive.If I had never heard of the show or the movie, maybe I wouldn't have made the effort. It's hard to say. Unless maybe I read a review that said it was worth the effort because there certainly isn't anything else out at the time of this writing that I'd want to see.So, I'm a fan and I was probably going to love Serenity no matter what. But I just want to say that the film exceeded even my expectations. It went beyond the beyond and succeeded in telling a riveting story filled with richness of character and absolutely wonderful dialog. And then came a sucker-punch that left me in shock. I think Serenity will surprise a lot of people who dismissed it out of hand because how could a movie made from a failed TV show be any kind of success? Because it's good, that's why.I'm going to see it again. And probably one more time after that for good measure. Serenity is worth the drive.",Serenity
560,mytragicflaw,"Smart, Character Driven Science Fiction",10,22 May 2006,"Most science fiction films today are so full of flash and bang, that they neglect the characters that move their story. Most film's characters are so wafer-thin or cardboard cut-outs. They are stereotypical, they are either cut, stoic heroes or loud,brash and sarcastic, but their reasons are never explored. While Serenity is no My Left Foot, it does examine the relationships between the protagonists, without sacrificing the action and suspense found in pictures of this genre. While having watched the TV show it was based on, Firefly, could be useful for understanding all the motives, it is not needed. I had not watched the show, saw the movie, was engrossed with it's universe and moved to explore it more. Nathan Fillion did a great job as well as Ron Glass, even though his part seemed trimmed down a bit. This film will transcend all concrete boundaries in the film world. Fans of different genres will enjoy this smart,entertaining film.",Serenity
561,ka-goodwin,Go get um!,10,6 October 2005,"I went to a preview tonight of Serenity and it was very good.Have to say the best part though was in advert for seasons 1 & 2 of Angel and Buffy. Yummy David on the big screen for even a few seconds is better than nothing! Am I sad or what! Don't answer that. Back to Serenity.....The script was typical Joss material. having a girl whip every bad guy in sight. The jokes, killing off one of the leads guys (Washburn) mid way through a joke. Oh how I miss Btvs and Ats. It wasn't perfect but I've never seen a movie that is. The action stuff was awesome, the bad guys really bad, the story was excellent. Some aspects of the script were from the tried and tested formula (programme a telepathic killer and let her brother rescue her and send the bad guy to get her back anyway he has to) but it had some unexpected twists in there (it took its time to reveal the plot as to why they needed to stop her). The space ships and SFX were great. Loved the blood shot eye of Captain Reynolds near the end, much more realistic than usual. Oh ya, not killing the bad guy when you so wanted him dead, was the best bit of miss direction ever. You'll see why if you go watch the movie.On the minus side......The script had its slow spots. Joss indulged himself a little to much with unnecessary dialogue and slowed the pace down too often. The music during these scenes didn't help. Way to much silence for me. It killed the flow. And they should have gone back a looped a few words that were unintelligible. I found myself more than once not having a clue as the significance of what had just been said. It was an unwanted distraction.Having said that, I'm going to see it again. If you can go see it. No for knowledge of the show is required.",Serenity
562,Yvaughn,"Fast paced, believable SF",10,30 September 2005,"I won't bother to gush about whether Joss Whedon is a god or anything would it ramp up my credibility? While I've enjoyed far more of his TV work on Buffy, Angel, and Firefly than not, even he doesn't wow me every single time.Serenity wowed me.I wasn't bored for a moment as I watched the adventures of these tattered, mismatched underdogs trying to survive in a uberdog's world without having to forfeit their human decency (well, except for Adam Baldwin's Jayne one of the fun things about Jayne is, he's so forthright about not thinking he's a decent human). The metaphor of space as a literal frontier, especially with its lace of orientalism, creates a fascinating version of a human future that's neither a STTNG utopia (sorry, oh great Rodenberry, but I got a little bored with that) nor a Terminator/1984/Brave New World/Fahrenheit 451 dystopia (which, classics or not, always kind of bummed me out). To me, it's far, far more believable that hundreds of years from now, assuming humanity survives at all, we'll still be facing corporate and political powers that try to control too much and independent minded individuals rebelling against that control.Maybe that's the biggest draw for me. Despite being SF, Serenity is infinitely believable. There are no alien races to deal witheveryone, even the Reavers, are technically human. There are no magical powers, beyond River's psychic abilities and enhanced fighting skills. Bad things happen and people get through it, just like in real life. The good guys are flawed. The bad guys are motivated by more than evil. The men are more than cookie-cutter action heroes (if only the people who make NUMB3RS could make David Krumholtz' Charlie look as good as his adorable Mr. Universe on Serenity). The women are equally as competent and multi-faceted as the males, which is especially unusual in the once-male-dominated world of SF, even from writers (like those of Star Trek) who honestly try, and certainly not those (like those of Star Wars) who, beyond the occasional blaster-wielding princess, do not. The strong women in Serenity aren't tokens. They're people, just like the men. People who can, for the most part, kick their share of Alliance butt.And the dialog! Boy howdy, to be able to write humor and dialog like Joss Whedon.Is Serenity blockbuster material? I couldn't sayI've avoided most of the recent ""blockbusters"" because they no longer carry the guarantee of a solid plot to match their special effects and hype. Serenity, on the other hand, has foregone the big hype for a sincerity that's worth far more. It has great characters, a fast paced plot, moments of horror, moments of absolute rightness, and optimism without condescension. It's smart. It's funny. And it's definitely worth the price of admission maybe more than once.",Serenity
563,almu99,Just not good enough,7,28 November 2015,"I think it's probably quite pointless to watch the movie without first watching the series since it's pretty much an extension of it. However not a good enough extension.* What annoyed me the most was the character's personalities. The characters were no longer acting like themselves. For starters Mal was overly angry and even saying that he'd kill anyone in the crew who wouldn't cooperate to flying into almost certain death. Where was the joking, light-hearted but that ultimately had the final word captain that we had come to love? Zoe hardly showed any unwavering loyalty for the captain. There was almost no chemistry between her and Wash whose sarcastic happiness was gone. Kaylee's bubbly attitude was nowhere to be seen. Simon was basically just angry the whole time that his sister was in danger and his somewhat upright and awkward personality was also suddenly gone. River hitting her brother because she thought he wouldn't listen to her? Yeah right. At least Jayne was pretty much the same. As for Inara and the Shepard, they appeared so little it was as if the makers were trying to show off that they had managed to hire the same cast. They could have left the two of them out and focused more on the people who were actually on the ship. Because of all this, what really drew our attention to the story, the relationship the crew had with each other was completely ruined.*If the characters had been good the plot would have been overlook-able. Making reavers the main enemy was great. I even got goosebumps the first time they were flying into Miranda. But it all got ruined as soon as they were actually fighting them. The monsters were suddenly reduced to cavemen looking people with scarred faces. Also, how are we supposed to fear them knowing that River is now a super karate assassin. The part with the reavers being the alliance's fault; I really don't get the big deal about it. It ruins the mystery about the men who went savage in space. And so what if it's the alliance's fault? It'd be some political scandal but essentially my attitude towards it is ""whatever"".It's nice to see that the series had some sort of conclusion through the movie. But part of me also wishes they just hadn't done it.",Serenity

I was introduced to it later, and supported it by purchasing the DVD set. I immediately got sucked into the story. The writing was fantastic, and the characters just grew on you at the first episode. The Serenity movie is a complete standalone from the series. Joss Whedon (the director) grabs your face, and holds it at the screen for the entirety of the film. Its action, its drama, its comedy. Its magnificent! If you're a fan of Sci-Fi, go see it. If you're a fan of westerns, go see it. If you're a fan of comedy, go see it. If you're a fan of movies at all, go see this movie.

565,gcd1707,"Watchable, but not Great",4,20 March 2007,"I have a feeling that how much people like this movies depends on how much they like Firefly. Never having seen the series, I can only say this is a mediocre, but fairly entertaining film. It may even be a great extended episode--I can't say one way or another--but as a movie it's so-so.What really grated on me, though, was the assassin and the entire ending. The assassin was trying to come off as some kind of evangelical vigilante, but he was neither over the top enough to be an outright villain, nor was he fleshed out enough to be more than a stock character. More obnoxiously, which leads me to the ending, his character has his windpipe crushed, yet still orders his men to stand down, and completely changes his ideology in a matter of moments. I simply can't buy that a character so obviously one-dimensional would suddenly switch his allegiances so rapidly. Furthermore, it really aggravated me that essentially every character was mortally wounded, yet still lived. Either don't stab them through the guts, or kill them off. It's a cheap device to have it both ways.I suppose that I was ultimately disappointed that the novel idea of a space Western ended with such a formulaic, all loose ends tied up ending. With a better script, this could have been much more than a follow up for Firefly fanboys/girls.",Serenity

I will see this multiple times. I saw it amongst folks who had not seen the television series, and when I asked them if they had trouble following the storyline, they denied any. Having seen the series in the intended sequence, I was very impressed with this movie, and how it ""fit"" with the established television storyline.Acting and writing were top-notch. Very good pacing and dialogue. The effects were excellent, and they fit into the story seamlessly, and were not an end unto themselves. Even though the story is completely self-contained, an opening was left for a continuing storyline.

Fair warning, it's not an entirely easy movie to see, exactly because you do care so much.The actors are the same wonderful ensemble from the show, and the way they work together makes it utterly believable that they have been flying around ""the 'verse"" together for some time. It is also clear that they love the work as much as their characters love their ship. There is nothing fake here, no false notes in story or presentation. I would have only liked it better if it were longer, because it has been a long dry time since Angel went off the air, and the world needs more of Whedon's work in it.",Serenity

It makes me wish that I had watched the series Firefly (which I did not). Actually, it makes me wish that Fox would pick up the storyline and make TV episodes of Serenity.All of the characters were well-developed. They had personalities of their own. They were likable.

It's simply insane how the show was canned-another one of FOX's ""great ideas"". So Sad. The cast of fantastic actors revisited their characters flawlessly and continue to enthrall you, with the great writing of puns and offhanded comments making it into so much more then just an 'action/sci-fi movie' With a larger budget then the TV series had, the special effects (which were amazing in 'Firefly') simply blow you away! Honestly! I've never been in space, a space ship, or a gun fight...but after seeing 'Serenity' I've now got a very realistic idea of how everything would play out; There are no matrix-y *fake* special effects, and even the action sequences that seem unreal at first, are choreographed in such a way that it looks completely believable. One thing I will say, is that it's best if you watch the TV Series 'Firefly' before watching 'Serenity', since Serenity is basically a continuation of the TV Show a lot of stuff will make more sense if you see Firefly first, it's no hard feat I promise!",Serenity

Well, I took my girlfriend to see the movie (she hates sci-fi, but loves horror - go figure) and she absolutely loved the movie! From the opening sequence right until the very last second of this movie, I was on the edge of my seats! You can boast about the Star Wars franchise all you want, but Joss Whedon has far exceeded the hype that was a dismal episode three, and created a sci-fi movie that was worth every penny spent to create. Joss Whedon also succeeded in creating - in my opinion and a great number of other people that walked out of the theater - in creating the most VILE and HORRIBLE villain in cinematic history! The un-named Alliance Assassin was the villain of all villains! This movie is worth seeing over and over again, and Congratulations to Mr. Whedon for providing disappointed Star Wars fans with a worthy, fun-filled ride, through a true science fiction adventure!

From the first scene my skin was tingling with excitement. I've read some criticism of the special effects - but it must have been from a total geek who spends far too much time examining the quality of digital effects and not paying enough attention to the story. I thought the special effects were brilliant.You don't have to be a fan of Firefly to follow the story, I would think that this film could stand alone as a really good sci-fi story. It follows the tradition of sci-fi that questions the attitudes of those do-gooder types in our society who think they should be able dictate how we behave. The story was intelligent but easy to follow, making it very watchable. Try to avoid anyone telling you the plot, it would be more enjoyable to experience all this for yourself first-hand.The action scenes were brilliant, great choreography for the fight scenes, and the space battles were better thought out than those in Revenge of the Sith, which I felt were just messy and over-produced.I also liked the way you couldn't really tell whether the writers were trying to bring the Firefly/Serenity saga to a close, or whether there was an opening for a new series. As far as this film is concerned that doesn't really matter, another reason you don't need to be a fan of Firefly to enjoy this.I hope we do see these characters again, but if not I'm more than happy with this film - it was so much better than any of the recent Star Wars films!!",Serenity

I needn't have worried - this is the most exciting film of the year (and that's a year that included new films by George Romero, David Cronenberg and 2 from Tim Burton, as well as Wolf Creek). The film starts in enormously playful mood but gets progressively darker until by the end I was traumatised by what the beloved characters had gone through. The final half hour was so exciting I was sweating like a pig! Also, the performances by the regular cast were amazing, even actors like Sean Maher and Gina Torres who were a little mediocre in the show were fantastic. What the creative team have achieved with a relatively tight budget is phenomenal. Go see!",Serenity

The plot, and especially the characters, really make the show fly. Serenity is just as good, if not better. I absolutely loved this film.I think this film, much like the original series, is a hard sell. It's hard to see what's great about it until you get involved. It may not do so well initially at the box office, but I think it will see a lot of love for it over time, making it one of the bigger ""sleepers"" out there, much like Shawshank Redemption.",Serenity
578,dinsvin,Worth the wait!,9,1 April 2006,"This is the follow up movie to the first season TV sci-fi series ""Firefly"". The series are way heavy on drama and western, and they tend to get a bit slow, lacking action. Though I have come to like ""Firefly"" I feel that I must add that it just barely crosses the line between drama and sci-fi. It does have great potential to become a whole new really solid and kewl sci-fi show. What season one lacks sci-fi and action wise ""Serenity"" certainly makes up for. ""Serenity"" has to be one of the best sci-fi movies of the year. The critics loved it but the audience stayed away and once again that proves just what poor taste I have. Personally I don't like most of Joss Whedon's other work; loathe ""Angel"" and hate ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". The sickening tendency to try and please the mainstream, like with the two above mentioned shows, shines through in ""Firefly"" and has not successfully been overcome in ""Serenity"". Not that it has ruined the movie, but the outcome does have a bit of HALLMARK-stench attached to it! What it needs is edge! A bit more blood, gore and meanness. In my opinion they have created the scariest' mutant psychopaths in space ever  REAVERS!!! Unfortunately they provide us with way too many answers about them, and not nearly enough screen time, not in ""Firefly"" nor ""Serenity"". REAVERS are my BORGS. Don't care much for ""Star Trek"" find it a bit monotonous, but the episodes with the BORGS in them I almost love. ""Serenity"" is visually fantastic, the scenery and CGI is tops, it has the cast from ""Firefly"" which is an absolute plus, they do it better than well. Word is that; this is it! No more if that's true; you stupid ...! We sat through an entire season and actually learned to appreciate it, hoping for you to get it together and make something of it. A bit of a slow start, admitted, but if you aim to break new grounds stick with your promises. Give us the next season, make it follow the path of ""Serenity"" you at least owe us that much Mr. Whedon. Or are you that much of a wimp? It's not a box office hit so you give up? Never mind the budget, some of the best movies are made for nickels and dimes, it's the stories that count and you, Mr. Whedon, 's got a really kewl story! The first season and ""Serenity"" can not stand alone. If ""Serenity"" and ""Firefly"" is not pursued then it has all just been for nothing, a waste of time and unfinished work.

The recent 3 Star Wars films were lame by comparison, with a heavy-handed story and incredibly bad dialog. Yes they had lots of fights and battles and great special effects, but the fun was gone.Serenity brings us back to an original style of adventure and other-worldliness. I don't say sci-fi because that it is much more part of the setting than part of the story.

All this and Summer Glau, who is destined to be a big star. Jane and Mal had most of the best lines, of course, but everyone gets their due. This is a great leap forward from Whedon's earlier work, and shows the value of allowing a young film maker, intent on creating a true classic, complete creative control. I simply have not enjoyed an action film out of Hollywood to this degree for ages; Whedon shows true potential to bring the soul back to a soul-starved formula-driven industry.

There's SO much going on here, and it's amazingly good.There's never been a movie quite like this one. It defies easy genre categorization, and has so many beautiful moments, comedic moments, and fantastic action sequences that it has got to appeal to a much wider than just a ""scifi"" audience. It really manages to deliver an important message while still being enormously entertaining -- a rare feat.Joss Whedon has crafted one of his tightest, most masterful scripts ever, and his directing is masterful.

Even though I loved the superb dialog in the series, it was a constant turn down with the cheap B-production quality of it, and I was hoping for that to be remedied in the movie with a much bigger budget. I am happy to say, my hopes were fulfilled and then some! It is as if Joss Whedon has taken all the brilliant dialog and plot-twist from a whole supposed-to-be second season of the series and put it in to just this one movie. On top of that he have removed all the cheapish look and sound from the series and turned it into an A-movie production.

It tears you apart. The characters are great, the dialog is snappy and at times very funny. And the universe that they create seems very unique and yet familiar. The action is superb. There's gunfight's, Kung-Fu, old fashion tough guy beat-downs, spaceships, hovercraft chases, sword fights and human pyshcotic monsters (reavers).

The two hours of film passed quickly, because it's still a light and fun show, but it's ultimately a mediocre action film with good special effects. Forget everything that has made the TV series a true cult: the dialogues full of funny jokes; vulnerable characters with a strong past; the relationships between them, so human; the continuous sense of independence and freedom. It was necessary to give a conclusion to the TV series, but this film comes out of the usual atmosphere: a lot of main characters remain only figurines in the background, and the added explanations are quite superficial as the final fight and the moral before the end credits.",Serenity

I can honestly say it lived up in every way. It's not necessarily better than the show, but it's just as good. It's like another episode.There were a few parts I disagreed with (you'll know when you see them), but other than that my only complaint was that the movie ended.The Firefly universe is something that I want to go on for a very long time. It's incredibly disappointing that this is probably the end. It would not be hard to come up with a story for a sequel.

586,roddickrocker21,Remarkable for a Television Adaptation,10,8 October 2007,"*Caution, this review contains minor spoilers*Serenity, the story of a crew of the Firefly-class spaceship ""Serenity"" who struggle to survive the dangers of the universe 500 years into the future and learn the frightening truth about a lost world on the edge of the galaxy, is without a doubt one of the greatest Science Fiction movies ever. One could even call it better than Star Wars, as I sure do.You may choose to skip this film because you never watched the TV Show Firefly, off of which Serenity was created. Let me tell you that when I saw this movie in theaters, I hadn't even heard of the show Firefly, and so I felt no fan boy bias whatsoever. And even after watching the entire series (short as it was) and the movie again, I still feel the same emotion and amazement that is illustrated in this movie.Serenity, like its television counterpart, is more than a Sci-Fi fan flick with spaceships and laser guns. Serenity tells a story of the losing side of an intergalactic war between humanity, similar and inspired by the US Civil War. It is, in genre, a SciFi-Western, where many references and similarities can be found between this and western films as well as science fiction films. One who enjoys either genre more than the other can enjoy this film, nevertheless.The film's visual effects are stunning for a low-budget adaptation like itself, and the camera work takes you into the action like it was filmed by passersby with a camera in hand. There is humor throughout to balance the dark storyline, and the characters are lovable (and hate-able). One of the best Science Fiction movies to date, Serenity takes one to a universe that is very different yet very similar to our own. It is definitely a film worth seeing, even is Science Fiction or Western is not your favorite genre. Give this unique film a chance, and I'm sure you will enjoy it.",Serenity

588,britwo,Joss Whedon shows us how to make a great sci-fi movie,10,26 October 2005,"Without a doubt the sci-fi success story of the year (ironically!) Although the series the movie was based on (Firefly) was axed, the fans for their part helped to keep the dream alive, by backing Joss Whedon, albeit not financially, with their very vocal support. One of the great things about this film was that the viewer did not have to have seen the series first, yet it managed to introduce the characters seamlessly, without disturbing the series fan by 'going over old ground.' It maintained the ethos, kept the moral ambiguity, the humour and the pace to such a degree that it was much more than an extension of the series, it was a fine piece of cinematic work in its own right. The plot was brilliantly written and executed, the visualisation superb, and without giving anything away to anyone who has not seen this film yet, not only expanded the knowledge of the universe it was set in, but coursed and writhed in beautifully controlled ways that the hardened fan could not have predicted. In short, if you haven't seen it then do, and if you have then see it again, because it is so well portrayed it bears revisiting many times. Let's hope a sequel / new series is in the pipeline, because it deserves it far more than many that have been given that privilege.",Serenity
589,SuperNatural01983,Loved It!,10,3 February 2007,"I loved Serenity. I saw it with my Mom when it came out. However, I didn't know it was based on a television show, FireFly, tell my Mom told me. I bought the DVD set for my Mom for Christmas and we watched the whole series together than the movie. I remember the actors faces from varies TV shows. Nathan Fillion, Adam Baldwin, Gina Torres and Summer Glau all appeared on either 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' or 'Angel'. I also remember Jewel Stait from an old Nick show called 'Space Cases'. I wished know since I saw the complete season of 'Firefly' and 'Serenity' that Joss Whedon had done more episodes. I would have believed it would have done a great success. Since all 'Stargate SG-1', 'Buffy' and 'Angel' all lasted more than 5 seasons, 'Firefly' could have lasted just as long. Although the movie gives you more info about the Reavers I would like to learn more about the characters past. I rate this more a 10-A+++.",Serenity
590,trile,End of All Hope,10,26 July 2007,"Serenity is fine example of ending a saga. For those who haven't seen Firefly TV series, movie is another story. They cannot comprehend how amazing this series could become. But someone in TV network decided people are not interested in space cowboys, real human personalities - not white, not black, but gray; and true power of different opinion! The movie has excellent story, effects and atmosphere. It ends the series but not in a way of 2 hour episode. This is exactly what other directors or producers should do with their work one day, whether their series are canceled or else. But who exactly follow Joss' steps? Approximately no one. You have things like 'Lost' which goes on and on forever, getting deeper and deeper into the matter and not explaining things or have some real plot, and eventually will become something like 'X-Files'.A must see!",Serenity
591,illjwamh,I can't even make up a word to describe how awesome it was,10,30 September 2005,"It's true, too. I want to say something like ""Joygasmic"" or ""Amazificent"", but they just don't do it justice.First off, I will say that yes, I have watched Firefly and was anticipating this movie the way a five-year-old anticipates Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. Given that, it should be taken as a remarkable thing that this movie exceeded even my expectations for how great it would be. Everything that was good about the show was there, and more, and everything a good sci-fi should have - everything a good MOVIE should have period - were there. Those two things are kind of one and the same, but I don't want anyone to think that they couldn't enjoy this movie if not familiar with the TV show. Prior exposure to the characters does add to the experience yes, but it is not by any means necessary.What isn't to like here? The characters are extremely well written and we feel for every one of them. The dialogue is fun and witty, and yet never too unrealistic or inappropriate to the moment. The overall story is enthralling and you really can't discern how it's going to play out as they keep throwing surprises at you. There's action for people who love action, great filming techniques for anyone who's into cinematography, and the music is out of this world. At the most important moments in the film it does just what it's supposed to do and just adds to the emotions you're feeling as you watch it.I laughed, I cried a little, and I whooped in excitement. And, in a truly rare case, there were actually a couple of times where I was doing all of those at once. I cannot recommend this movie enough, and I can't say any more or else I'll give something away and I really don't want to.",Serenity
592,CommonSns1,Storytelling Hollywood hasn't seen in ages,10,9 October 2005,"I finally got out to see Serenity. I was a fan of Firefly during it's brief stay on Fox and have been anticipating this movie since I first found news of it on this very site. I was saddened to see such a small crowd and the teeny screen the theater allocated to this fantastic movie.The writing was perfect with twists that come on suddenly and with complete surprise. Joss Whedon's only loyalty is to the continuity and believability of his story and it shows.This is a dark tale told with humor and no small amount of skill.Thank you, Mr. Whedon, for a wonderful ride. I have two more tickets for the next two rumored trips.",Serenity
593,dlenn,Serenity Kicks ass !,10,11 October 2005,"This film has been waited for for a long time and doesn't disappoint. What did disappoint was the lack of people in the theatre. Great characters and storyline you discover more things about the characters (if you watched them in Firefly)and it's a good introduction to them if you are new to the series. Great costumes, I loved Rivers' and Inara's costumes though Simons seemed very stiff and starchy the whole time. There were also plenty of kick ass fights. The reavers were particularly scary but Mal was as cool as ever with plenty of wise cracks. Kaylee is as Shiny as ever and I love that Zoe is a kick ass girlie. Wash was great, Jayne never changes and Shepherd book was there too.Great first walk-through, very long shot taking you through the whole of the ship. The master was at work. Yay Joss!",Serenity
594,showa48,Cheap Star Wars meets cheap Aliens and cheap Equilibrium...,1,29 December 2012,"...Dön't get me wrong: A big budget (cough cough ""Titanic"") does not guarantee a good movie. It was the whole feeling of cheapness, that permeated this movie, that bothers me.The acting, the dialogue, the plot and the SFX all seemed cheap, compared to other movies. It is not a budget problem as such, but more a problem of wanting to be everything for everyone at the same time - and ultimately failing at all fronts at the same time.-I am not usually good at spotting plot twist, but the operative turning in the end could (and should...!!) be seen miles away.-The action scenes looked and felt like cheap copies of Star Wars and Aliens.-The dialogue was cringeworthy to sit thru at times (Example: The sexual tension between two of the characters, the operative being so darn stereotypically ""bureaucratic evil"" etc.).I understand that the movie is based on a series, but as this is IMDb it is fair to judge this movie as a standalone product - ie. you cannot expect the audience having seen or being knowledgeable about the universe of the series beforehand. And as a movie, it fails to deliver.",Serenity
595,evilcritic,Don't even try to stop this signal!,9,16 October 2005,"Reviewing Serenity to someone who's completely unfamiliar with Joss Whedon's short-lived series ""Firefly"" is essentially like trying to describe the taste of Pepsi to a new-born child. A witty comedy-ridden action-thriller series set in a futuristic space-western, Firefly followed the exploits of a Firefly-class vessel named Serenity. It's crew  a band of guns for hire, smugglers and thieves who took in a pair of fugitives on the run from the evil Alliance. Sound a lot like Star Wars? Nah, it's a whole new ballgame.Six months after the events of the Firefly episode ""Objects In Space"", the crew of Serenity have fallen on harder times than ever. Their continued protection of River and Simon has started to severely affect their income and after a particularly hair-raising encounter with the Reavers (think Space-cannibals), the Tam's take their leave of Serenity.But when River's abilities begin to advance quicker than ever and an Alliance assassin begins to track her, it's up to Captain Mal Reynolds and the rest of the Serenity crew to get to the bottom of the Alliance's interest in young River once and for all.Simply put, Serenity is incredible. A film that truly pulls off the balancing act of being funny, intelligent, exciting and in parts even quite tragic, Writer/Director Joss Whedon has crafted a true winner.Non-fans of Firefly can expect a Star Wars/Indiana Jones-esquire roller-coaster that takes an admittedly clichéd concept and works it into part of an elaborately made sci-fi/mystery/thriller without equal. Firefly fans however can expect not just the same, but also both the perfect swansong to a fantastic series AND the set-up for could be the greatest franchise sci-fi has seen since y'know what.Each performance is subtley brilliant although some may complain that several of the supporting characters are criminally underused. Having said that though, this is Nathan Fillion's film. Halfway between being a typical Whedon character and a sort of Indiana Jones/Han Solo hybrid, Captain Malcolm Reynolds is quite a close contender for one of sci-fi's all time greatest characters. Hardened by the Alliance's continued threat, Reynolds is not the captain we left off from in Firefly, this new Reynolds is tougher and more willing to sacrifice an innocent if it means protecting his crew (or ""me and mine"" as he would phrase it). Fillion delivers a performance that simply HAS to evoke Harrison Ford comparisons with all of his own subtle nuances and best of all - his ingenious way of taking a beating.The SFX are as good as they ever were on Firefly, and although the franchise has now transitioned up to the big screen it was nice to find that the Western-score had been kept.Whedon surprisingly is quite a slick yet intense director, it's quite evident from Serenity that he obviously can handle a project of this scale. Having said that however, there are at least five very badly executed camera pushes throughout the film that although not quite as bad as any of George Lucas's work, are still a little cringeworthy. But anyone familiar with the Whedonverse knows that his strength lies not in his directing but in his writing. Serenity proudly boasts what can only be referred to as one of the best scripts written for any film in the last two decades. Every line is golden. From Kaylee's remark on her ""nethers"" to Mal's utterly fantastic delivery of ""I aim to misbehave"", the script is superb and any comedy director worth his salt should honestly give Adam Baldwin a starring vehicle for his quite evident fun with most of the funniest lines.The look of the film is quite unique as well. Although it follows the look of the series quite well, it adds an epic-depth to it that really does draw one into the piece. Serenity IS a real ship in this incarnation as opposed to a set. That kitchen IS a kitchen. The cockpityou get the idea. The conversion of TV shows to the big screen always tries to up the ante with it's look and more often than not fails (stand up Chris Carter, you know you torched The X-Files with that film). In this era of cinematic television, it's nice to see one true visual success.Although non-fans can enjoy Serenity, ultimately a fan who knows the series (and the comics that fill in the TV-to-movie void) quite well will enjoy it with a different level of depth. I saw this film with four friends, only one of whom had seen the show besides me and yet shockingly all five of us loved it beyond repair.See this film, see it right gorran now!",Serenity
596,moviesweetie1,Great movie!,6,1 October 2005,"Serenity is based on the Sci-Fi TV show, Firefly, with the original cast. It revolves around a group of misfit rebels who do odd jobs of thievery and robbery for sums of money. They pickup Dr. Simon Tam and his sister River. Simon has just kidnapped her from a military base where she was being used for experiments. With River's unpredictable actions, the crew aboard the Firefly ship Serenity, is chased by the alliance because River was able to discover government secrets. And the crew tries to figure it all out before being caught and taking care of their crew. It's a great movie with dialog carefully written and perfectly presented with many memorable quotes. Very very very good movie!",Serenity
597,isac_hunt_1,How not to recycle a script,1,6 November 2011,"I for one always greet the news of a new Sci-fi film/TV series with a little over-enthusiasm; the problem with Serenity is that it's not new. Serenity was put together by Joss Whedon after his TV Series (Firefly) was cancelled but that alone does not make it bad. If the writing for Firefly had contained more than a few plot differences from a heavily criticised script, Joss has already had made into a film, it may have been worth watching. I'll summarise the characters for demonstration.Take one socially withdrawn anti-heroine, with superhuman physical abilities and give her some form of impairment which means you're just not sure what side she'll be on in the next fight (ooh dangerous)... oh, forgot to mention that she should also be a military research project. Now casting, Joss is obviously looking for androgyny here (spot where I'm going yet?). She'll need some form of foil to extinguish those more tense situations within the crew and perhaps the two of them should be fairly fresh to the rest of the protagonists. Take said anti-heroine and mix in a crew of a small space vessel, who could loosely be called traders but just as equally be called pirates. This crew is anything but ordinary; you see we have one stereotypical brutish-hard-man, one mechanic who will be little more than baggage (LOL) in most action sequences, one level headed but troubled captain and surround with a plethora of disposability.With the above list of characters add a plot based around an enemy of human creation, what do you get; Alien Resurrection or should that read Serenity!!There are many other reasons to avoid this film but if, like me you don't enjoy hackneyed writing, better suited to children's TV, then I'd give this film a miss.",Serenity
598,jshardy13-1,Why did they cancel the series again? I can't figure it out...,10,31 December 2005,"The only reason I can even remotely think that they canceled the series was because it was too realistic. You have Mal, a veteran of a war he believed in and felt betrayed by his own side. So now he's a little less honorable and a lot more dangerous to those that cross him. I guess the network execs want Luke Skywalker and Captain Kirk a lot more than someone with true emotions and realistic responses in a situation. Then again network execs did launch shows like Cop Rock. That's my two cents worth.Other than that quick rant I thought the movie was excellent and very much worth watching at the theater, even though I didn't get to see it there, and worth buying the DVD. The extras are definitely worth it, but they should have left some of the deleted scenes in the movie. They actually would have helped the pacing and plot in perfect ways. Overall the movie was just like the series, outstanding, and I'd recommend it to anyone that likes sci-fi with a taste of reality.Oh and the women of Serenity are an added bonus. They are some of the most beautiful women in sci-fi ever.",Serenity
599,MCMLXXVI,Master of the small screen becomes master of the big screen,10,25 August 2005,"I have been an avid follower of Joss's work for many years. The cancellation of Firefly TV series (upon which this movie is based) broke my heart. This film more than remedies the situation. It is more than just another episode of Firefly. This is the culmination of all the years of effort that Joss has put into his TV work, brought to life with a big film budget.My only complaint is that I felt the story moved a little quicker than I would have liked. This is not so much a criticism of the film so much as a limitation of the medium. On TV, this story could be paced out across a season and more time spent on exploring the details more carefully.That said though, there are things in this movie that could never have been achieved on television, and not just from a visual standpoint, but also a narrative one. And in the end, this is what makes this a wholly satisfying experience.Without a doubt, my number one film of 2005.",Serenity
600,mpschmitt,"Part Star Trek, Part Clint Eastwood, Part George Romero, 100% Dumb",3,30 January 2006,"Bleh. I found this movie to be the celluloid equivalent of a Twinkie. Chock full of excessive martial arts sequences, Han Solo impersonators, strange dream sequences, and of course space cannibals (What's a sci-fi film without 'em?), but ultimately devoid of anything substantial, moving, or satisfying. In the words of that Ghostbuster whose name nobody remembers: ""That's a big Twinkie"".The ending is formulaic and predictable. The characters are only semi-likable and at times while viewing this film you will feel like you are watching someone else play Doom (not one of my favorite pastimes). I can't believe people would even compare this movie to Star Wars Episode III, let alone suggest that it was superior. After watching this film, I'm through watching movies for a while. I'm going back to books. And fresh garden salad.",Serenity
601,cool_imran89,best way to end a canceled show,10,30 December 2005,"I have one word to describe this movie, AMAZING. Joss Whedon really knows how to make a perfect ending to his shows. The start of the movie was very good and the ending of the movie was perfect. I had never seen any episode of the Firefly but i understood everything that happened in the movie and understood the roles of the people and their relationship between each other. Many things happened between the last episode of show and the beginning of the movie, for example Inara moves out and she and Mal had a big fight, Kaylee loves Simon even more, and Rivers powers as a physic becomes more stronger. But during the movie is the place where all the fun begins. Rivers kind of become a Warrior Women, i mean she literally takes out an entire club of men in couple of minutes. But thats not all, She is the one who found out about Miranda, a planet on which all people just died by not eating or talking or drinking with their own will. That was hard and painful. But the main thing of Miranda is that it is the creator of the Reavers. The Parliament hid it because they are the ones who did all this. But in the end there is a big fight scene between the crew and the reavers. Wash dies before that happens and Zoe has only one thing at her mind, Revenge. She just starts beating the hell out of the reavers and shooting every re-aver in sight. But then she get a taste of a sword and Simon get a taste of a bullet and Kaylee has been sought of paralyzed. but then there is River with them. She tell Simon that he has always taken after her and now its her turn to take care of Simon. She jumps out of the room they were hiding and just starts killing every Reaver in Sight. She just wiped out the entire re-aver party alone and she only had a few scratches. Mal finally sends out the word about what happened on Miranda. So i want all of the people who thought that firefly isn't good show, they should watch serenity because it is 1000% better than the show and its way better than Star Wars 3. I read in few reviews in the newspaper the George Lucos should learn a few things from Joss.",Serenity
602,fender12str,Not for the casual movie goer,8,2 October 2005,"I have never seen the TV series but have been a Joss Whedon fan from the days of Buffy. I have to say that this being his major motion picture directorial debut, there is a small taste of TV series flavor to Serenity. However, with that said this was a great movie. Within the first 10 minutes, I was so engrossed in the complexity of the characters that I wanted to go buy the short lived series as soon as I left the theater. I love the fact that good guys aren't perfect, nor in this case even completely good guys. But the human frailties to these characters made it more of a movie about people and less of just a cool sci-fi flick with special effects. This is how sci-fi should be made in the 21st century. There have been enough movies that show the latest technologies to woo and amaze us. It's about time a movie was made that uses those effects without making them the meat of the movie. I'm a huge sci-fi fan, but the shock value of explosions and space ships isn't where a great story is told. Gene Roddenberry understood that concept even after he got his million dollar an episode show. I applaud Joss Whedon on not relying on special effects to make a great sci-fi flick.",Serenity
603,ryan-craven-528-410093,The heroic return fans were waiting for.,8,1 April 2013,"Firefly's premature and unnecessary cancellation, there were still 3 episodes left, has only worked to further confirm the show's legendary status. Fanboys screamed in anger, and later in a cry of revenge and retribution, as they called for a heroic return for the crew of Serenity, led by Captain Reynolds, in a cinematic continuation of the unresolved and promising season. This bid was a huge success, but the box office performance less so, despite Serenity being a terrific piece of entertainment, one of the better examples of TV to film adaptations.The film plays out like an extended episode, only with stunning visuals and a director confidently relishing the challenge of the big screen. Serenity focuses on the secrets that River Tam, a fugitive saved from the Alliance's grasp by her loving brother Simon, may know about the corrupt and totalitarian government. The Operative (Chiwetel Eliojofor) is sent to track her down, and the Captain suitably 'aims to misbehave'. Whilst a lesser director would struggle to translate the many (and there are many) joys of Firefly into a film, Joss Whedon's talents seem to be more comfortably suited to it. The fast paced, refreshingly simple plot manages to provide the closure that so many fans wanted whilst avoiding alienating the newcomers, with a smart prologue that introduces the premise and fills in gaps from the TV series.The most impressive thing that Whedon has achieved is that he has managed to both cater to the many fans whilst also creating a story that encourages newcomers into the irresistible 'verse of 'Firefly'. This is in no small part down to the cast, who, led by Nathan Fillion, continue to develop their sharply drawn characters further. Fillion may well have found a home (or should have done) on the big screen: his self proclaimed impression of Harrison Ford being endearing, charismatic and thoroughly, completely impressive. Gina Torres, whilst hardly getting the lion's share of screen time, manages to make a bad ass impression in as many ways as Carrie Fisher did with the classic Star Wars trilogy. Also impressive are Adam Baldwin and Jewel Staite, who's traits and characteristics create some of the highlights of the film. Of the cast though, it is Summer Glau who deserves most credit. With the most challenging part, she shows great nuance and talent, whilst also wowing in the action scenes. Regrettably, though, Alan Tudyk, with by far the least screen time, gets the brunt of the exposition, with lines like 'Let's just get to the beacon' being his only material to work with. Whedon does, however, make up for this with a wonderfully judged and wholly satisfying 'Wash' moment that will have many fanboys shedding a tear.Verdict: With minimal exposition, maximum wish fulfillment, Joss Whedon has done the impossible by creating a superbly entertaining and satisfying film adaptation of a, yes, CANCELLED TV show.",Serenity
604,CageBerry,Why are people going ape for this?,5,4 October 2005,"Just to give warning, I know nothing of the television show. I didn't even know it was based on a show until a co-worker of mine told me it was. On to what counts: I really don't know what people found so fantastic about this movie. I mean... it sure wasn't as bad as The Ring 2 (don't get me started on that one), but apart from some decent visuals and a fair share of comic relief, there was nothing at all I found to be the slightest bit enjoyable about this movie. For starters, it was WAY too long for it's own good. They could have probably compressed it to about an hour and 15 minutes and it would have been a little better. Every five minutes I found myself tilting my head back in my seat and sighing/grunting due to complete boredom. I constantly sat there asking myself ""how are the people I'm here with staying awake?"".The story really didn't seem like anything new.****Semi-spoiler**** (Not sure if this gives anything away about the general plot. Again, not familiar with the television show) To be honest it reminded me a lot of Equilibrium. The whole alliance/rebels thing, paired up with the ""perfect society"" and brainwashing idea is seeming a little played out for me now I guess. And what's the deal with having these somewhat super-human dudes that know all the kung-fu nerve killing pressure points and crazy stuff like that? I know it's sci-fi, but really... it's not that cool unless its... well, a kung-fu movie. ****End semi-spoiler****Quite literally, the only reason I didn't fall asleep was the constant little bits of humor. Those ""Well... you can't"" type jokes were going off left and right. They showed up even in the tenser scenes which will definitely catch you off guard. One second you'll be waiting for a firefight you know is going to happen (another downfall, it was pretty predictable), and they'll toss in a pg-13-friendly sex joke out of nowhere. The big final ""oooooooh didn't see that coming"" wasn't too horrible. Quite frankly I never even gave the slightest bit of thought that that was what's going on (but that could be 'cause I was dozing off). It kind of gave the movie a little bit of substance so it's not one of those ""what the hell was the point"" movies like the Blair Witch Project. But overall, it's insane resemblance to the movie I mentioned in the semi-spoiler just made it a bore-fest for me. It definitely wouldn't be #118 on my top 250, that's for sure.",Serenity
605,TheZapRowsdower,...the tongue-in-cheek serial this decade has been waiting for.,8,4 October 2005,"I never watched Firefly, but I've heard it was one of Fox's many wrongfully canceled TV series. Creator Joss Whedon decided to show Fox what they were gonna miss out on, and he brought a film version of his series to Universal. Those Fox execs must be feeling really stupid now. Not only is Serenity a hit, but it's also a damn good movie.This is one of the most original science fiction films I've seen in a long time. Joss Whedon put plenty of effort into the mythology surrounding it- he brought us a new world of fantasy the likes of which we haven't seen since the original Star Wars. I mention Star Wars because Serenity is also reminiscent of the old serials. Non-stop action, likable characters, and the escape from one dangerous situation only to walk into another, it's all there.The cast had great chemistry. Perhaps it's the fact that they've all worked together before, but they played off each other very well and all seemed to be having fun. Summer Glau, however, stands out above the rest. Not only can she kick ass, but she can act. Her performance is one of the best this year, because of her ability to show a hint of humanity under her veil of mystery, rage and sadness.Joss Whedon wrote a screenplay that elevates the quality of his movie above that of the Star Wars prequels. Unlike the Star Wars prequels, Serenity has personality. It has characters we care about; characters we understand and can relate with. The screenplay comes equipped with the naturalistic humor, wit and energy that hasn't been seen (although it has been attempted) since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.As Whedon's first big screen effort, he really did an impressive job directing the film. He carried out his vision of the future much better than most with his experience would. Considering this guy normally does TV series for the WB, I was very impressed.The visual effects weren't quite as prestigious or 100% perfectly integrated like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, but they weren't overbearing and they maintained the fantasy. Besides, it was kinda nice to see that while CGI was used quite a bit, they didn't try to replace the story with it.David Newman's score was beautiful. It's difficult to describe it, but this was the most exciting original score I've heard all year. My one complaint would be that it should have been used more.Surprisingly enough, Serenity is one of the best movies of the year. It is perfect in every aspect, and it's also the tongue-in-cheek serial this decade has been waiting for. I'm told I should try to watch Firefly, and believe me, I'm going to. If it means watching a longer version of Serenity, I'm in.Premise: 10 Performers: 10 Screen writing: 10 Direction: 10 Visual Effects: 10 Original Score: 10 Oscar predictions: Best Picture*, Best Actress in a Leading Role (Summer Glau)*, Best Original Screenplay (Joss Whedon)*, Best Original Score (David Newman), Best Visual Effects, Best Sound *Wishful thinking.

I went to see it for two reasons1. the trailer looked cool 2. it got a good review in the seven daysI didn't know what to expect, but i actually really enjoyed it. It was funny, sad, exciting and witty. It had action, drama, everything i really want in a film.I wouldn't say it was my absolute favourite film of all time, but was an enjoyable two hours and it made me buy the series on DVD, which is excellent.Also, to the people who talked most of the way through the film: you're going to the special hell!!!",Serenity
607,StarAxis,"A refreshing twist on various sci-fi clichés, and a delight for Firefly fans!",9,30 December 2005,"One of the preconceptions I've had to deal with is the notion that, ""adult women don't like sci-fi movies/books/anime, sci-fi is for 14-year-old boys only."" So when I show up on an Outlaw Star, Cowboy Bebop or Firefly fan-site and tell them that I'm a 26-year-old woman, I have a hard time getting anyone to take me seriously. This is odd, because I know I'm not the only woman in my age group that I know who loves Firefly, and thus loved Serenity. But, anyway, onto the movie. It might not be quite as good as the series, but it's still better than most of the drivel being churned out by Hollywood these days. All of the characters return (even Inara, who left during the last few filmed episodes of the series) with a more-than-cursory flair and the classic Joss Whedon wit. The dialogue is just as snappy as the series (""This is the captain speaking, we've run into a few complications, so we may experience some turbulence, and then... explode""), and it was an excellent feature- film directorial debut for Whedon. The character interaction (the uniqueness of which is what set the Firefly series apart from so many cliché-laden other sci-fi series out there) is admittedly not at the forefront, for once taking a back seat to the plot. Mostly the acting is okay (not perfect, but better than most movies being made today), but one of the truly great performances in all of sci-fi is given by ""guest star"" Chiwetel Ejiofor as The Operative. The part is well-written and wonderfully acted. A lot of the dialogue in the film is great, but The Operative gets one of the greatest lines ever given by a movie villain, ""You should know, so that you don't waste your time, you can't make me angry."" Also, the massive space battle between the two fleets is wonderful. And how can you go wrong with Summer Glau suddenly transforming into a kung-fu master? Now, the main drawback is that the movie may seem hard-to-follow for people who haven't seen the TV series. But this wasn't exactly made to get new people interested, it was made to answer questions that fans of the series had unanswered. Why does the Alliance want River? Where did Reavers actually come from? These are questions that Joss Whedon heard a million times from his cult following. Instead of forcing them to write the solutions themselves in fanfictions, Joss Whedon decided to answer those questions ""officially"" in this movie. But he didn't only make it because of that, he also wanted to give the actors a chance to play the characters again (Nathan Fillion has especially said how he fell in love with his character), and because he himself loved the series so much. Since the movie was meant to be MOST accessible to fans of the series, people who haven't seen it might find it a bit confusing. And because it was about answering questions, the character development took a backseat to the plot (for once). This is the reason that some of the people who haven't seen the series didn't like the movie. It answered questions that those people hadn't posed, and didn't show off the character interaction as well as it might have. Overall, the movie seems to assume that you have seen the series before you see the movie. But even a good many newbies did like it, although they would have liked it even better had they seen the series (and, in my opinion, for better reason).I am aware that the movie isn't perfect. I was hoping we would see the infamous ""Hands of Blue"" guys again (and that they would meet a sticky end, perhaps from a breakdown in their own blood-boiling radio thing), but, then again, it wasn't really about them. The Alliance was buddies with the Blue Sun Corporation anyway, so having the Alliance send an Operative after her doesn't really leave a loose end in terms of what the Blue Sun guys would do. But overall, it's wonderful, a fitting finalé to the series. I wish the box office returns had been so good that more movies were likely to follow (and I also wish Whedon would let me help write the next few *crosses fingers*), but hey, the show was canceled as well, and THIS movie got made! Just proof that anything is possible...Overall? See it. It isn't quite as good as the series, but fans of it won't be disappointed.",Serenity
608,guyrowlanduk-1,Strictly for sci-fi nerds,5,17 October 2005,"Abysmal characterisation, atrocious dialogue and awful acting. Funnily enough, like an episode of a sci-fi nerd's TV series, only louder.Just at the point where, bored witless and losing the will to live, I was about to walk out, the film actually found a good idea or two. The last 50 minutes were to my amazement quite good fun (though shamelessly ripping off Aliens more than once). But it didn't make up for the rest.Go into your local bookshop, and you'll find hundreds of books on the shelves that could turn into movies like this. Die-hard sci-fi fans will be delighted at this idea, but others may well conclude that painful exposition batted around by soap opera characters do not make a great movie. Some have said this is the sort of film the final three Star Wars should have been - in reality they compliment each other rather well as they've all lost any sense of coherent narrative or believable performances.If this is the pinnacle of sci-fi cinema in the 21st century, God help us all.",Serenity

Well this film was a huge disappointment. There are so many rip offs from so many other sci fi films is absurd. I find it really interesting that America is fascinated by stupid crap like this. Seriously, how is this considered entertainment? In my mind with the amount of money these films are given, there is no excuse for them to put out a crappy film, such as this. Anyway, I've lost all faith in America's moviegoers. Avoid this movie.",Serenity
611,Tiribulus,Great flick and series,10,10 January 2006,"Not being much of a TV guy I had never even heard of Firefly until a friend at work recommended Serenity as a movie he thought I would like. It came out in Blockbuster last week and I loved it. I had no problem getting familiar with the Firefly universe or the characters, all of which I thought were great. I immediately did want to see the series which my friend let me borrow on DVD. I also loved the show which I have since bought. Superb sci/fi. I watched all 14 episodes in 2 nights and the movie 3 times in the last week. The casting couldn't possibly have been better as I found every performer perfectly suited to their part. I think the ""personality"" of the Firely universe is what both endears it to some and turns off others which is totally understandable. People have different tastes. It's quirky, bizarre and even goofy sometimes, but also compelling and believable. From the opening sequence I had my eyebrows raised plenty and found myself mumbling with a smile ""what the hell?"". For my part I think it a monumental tragedy that the show wasn't pursued further and it will be just as tragic if we don't get sequels to Serenity, though it wood be awkward without Wash, being his marriage to Zoe and all. Someone with Whedon's creativity could pull it off though. I also think the choice of virtually unknown actors/esses was brilliant because you have no preconceived ideas and these people become their characters before your very eyes. I can actually understand the honest criticisms from those who didn't find it to their tastes, but I thoroughly enjoyed both the series and the movie and am convinced that many who have not experienced either would as well. Tiribulus - Detriot",Serenity
612,dixanII,"Could have been better, could have been worse.",10,26 July 2006,"I'm going to start by saying I loved the Firefly series, even with it's little quirks from episode to episode - I still loved every moment of it. Upon seeing the film I had just finished watching the series on DVD just a week before. So everything about characters and plot was clear in my mind, which was probably a bad thing unfortunately. There were many continuity errors not to mention character changes. Sean Maher's character Simon changed drastically from the last episode of Firefly and this really put a spear in my side. He became very stiff and way too tough from the quiet, sometimes helpless doctor he once was in the series. Other characters didn't meet this fate as badly, with characters like Zoe and Jayne there isn't much that can change because of the simplicity of their characters in the first place - which is fine. But a character such as Simon, which was in essence a pretty well developed, multi-layered character had lost all of that in the film. In the movie he is just angry, one-sided and surprisingly bad-ass, but I didn't like it. Maybe in the 3 years from the end of Firefly to the release of Serenity his character was lost... Not to mention his back story with River changed from the show as well - I won't give it away, but it is different nonetheless. Everyone looked pretty good though, Wash's clothes while he was flying were a bit distracting because they were very different, but while he wasn't flying he was back to wearing familiar Hawaiian t-shirts. Zoe, Jayne, Mal and Kaylee looked alright and did well, especially Nathan Fillion in his role as Captian Malcom Reynolds. Inara actually seemed less attractive then she did in the series which I thought was strange, I imagined her looking even better on better quality film, but I was wrong. Also the film is basically Mal and River and that's about it, the other characters just seem to be part of the landscape for the most part.The whole film had this light-bluish tint that I found bothersome. It is a film strategy that is by today's standards overused. Going back to Fight Club with it's dark greens and drab colors or Black Hawk Down with its bluish-greens filter for the night vision look when there was none. And now in 2005 a light blue filter for many scenes. :shrugs: What can ya do? Anyways - all in all many hardcore fans of the Firefly series will love this regardless - mostly because it's just a slightly lengthy episode, running only about 35 minutes longer than the pilot episode of Firefly with a bigger and better budget. CGI scenes are pretty impressive as well, but not overdone like for example Star Wars Episodes I through III. Probably worth seeing if you love the series, but be warned you may be disappointed by character development problems.",Serenity
613,torndownunit,Great Movie....if you've seen the series,9,22 August 2007,"Being a sci-fi fan, I saw this movie when it originally came out and thought it was a decent movie. I had never seen Firefly the series though. I recently bought the complete series because they had it for %40 at the stores here for some reason. I watched the series and loved it. I went back again right after wards, watched the movie again and absolutely loved it this time.Basically, check out the series. If you like it, you will likely enjoy the movie. If you don't like it, you likely won't. It's a movie that's definitely made for fans, and doesn't spend much time on back story or character development. All that was done in the series. As a new fan, I think this was a fantastic movie.I'd have to agree with the 'fanatics' of Firefly after all my recent viewing of the film and the show. It's great sci-fi, and it's a shame it was so short lived. What's even more a shame is I don't even recall ever series this series in re-runs here (Canada). If it was shown on the Space channel, I think it would get a whole new fan-base.",Serenity
614,johnneypickles,Shiny!!!!!!,10,26 September 2015,"The best way to describe this movie is with these words: Very shiny. In other words, This movie was great!!!! I had fairly high expectations for this, since Firefly is my second favourite TV show ever (first being Buffy) and the movie is getting pretty great reviews with the fans. And I must say, Serenity completely exceeded those expectations, and, in my humble opinion, is just as good as the TV show. We finally get to see the Reavers in this movie, and they look great!!! The villain of this movie is also pretty fantastic, but I won't give too much away about him. The battles in this movie are great, but they actually fit into the storyline, and aren't just there for the point of having a fight. There are some great music in this movie, really funny lines, but also genuinely sad moments. This movie has everything, action, drama, comedy, suspense (kinda), adventure. I would recommend this move to anyone, because even people who haven't seen FireFly can watch it, though I recommend watching firefly first.",Serenity
615,pmacattack84,A perfect popcorn movie,9,19 October 2005,"It's pathetic that The Fog is on track to make more money at the box office than Serenity. If you figure that a short-lived TV show could never yield a decent movie, you're on track to skip the most entertaining and satisfying film I've seen all year.Firefly (the prior TV show) and Serenity both follow a group of space rogues who run around the galaxy, both taking legal jobs and committing all sorts of petty crime, in a junky old space freighter. The main conflict comes in the form of a couple of passengers - the siblings Simon and River Tam - who are hunted by the imperial Alliance. River in particular has been psychologically tortured and turned into an unpredictable living weapon who, naturally, knows more than she should about the Alliance's misdeeds. An assassin is dispatched to recapture the two, and the chase is on.Since the crew of Serenity are space rogues in the tradition of Han Solo and company, they're all good looking and throw off more witty and funny banter in 10 minutes than many of us could manage in a year. Action is plentiful and plenty exciting, and carries a sense of genuine danger that is cultivated by some shocking risks on writer/director Whedon's part. The acting isn't notably outstanding, but the jokes work and when emotion is called for, emotion comes forth. The only thing that really doesn't work as well is the ""inspirational speech"" section, which seems a bit out of character for this particular group of characters. The plot itself also seems a bit episodic rather than working as a unified whole, but this typical flaw in TV-to-movie adaptations is also a typical flaw in action movies in general and isn't really anything to get bent out of shape about.What is most impressive about Serenity is that its plot can be followed even by someone with no prior knowledge of the TV show's world (like me). All relevant information is covered before the real games begin, and Firefly fans will still surely get an extra charge from seeing their beloved characters back on a screen.In short, anyone looking for two hours of action/comedy diversion could barely do better. Put your reservations about Firefly to rest and take a risk, and enjoy an awesome movie that's more Star Wars than Star Wars has been lately. 9/10",Serenity

I just could not believe how vibrant and wonderful it all was. I was really afraid that those people who hadn't seen the series would be left out in the cold, but Joss fixes the movie to where it answers questions for those who have seen the series,without being redundant, and doesn't confuse those who have never seen it. I truly tip my hat to Mr. Whedon...very well done sir. You are a true master in the arts of storytelling.I truly hope that Mr. Whedon can make 2 more movies and make them just as spectacular or better. You MUST see this movie!!!!!

Good movies of such a genre are few and far between. War of the Worlds was good enough, but still not quite worth buying once its released.So I went and saw Serenity, having not seen a single bit of Firefly. The dialog, the story, the music, the effects, the blending of cliché Sci-Fi with western influences and Chinese language all made this a great movie. This really is great movie. Heck, even the villain rocks.Really, all I can say is that it was written very very well.

It is a relief that there were two science-fiction films of high caliber this year, ""Batman Begins"" being the other one.Some of the style-ings are unconventional, and you have to listen carefully to the dialogue where a lot of important plot points are revealed (this movie assumes you are a person of some intelligence and attention), however this film is handsomely worked, with all manner of surprises and amazing action sequences that you can actually follow.There are many themes explored in the film, political, intellectual, personal... and they all are circumferenced by hilarious antics and dialogue. Writer-Director Joss Whedon is an expert at playing with emotion, but he doesn't sacrifice the dignity of the film in order to do it.All the actors are believable, complete with brilliant timing, and profound depth to each action and facial twitch. As much as the dialogue is key in the film, there is at least as much revealed through the silent responses of the actors in their roles.This film appeals to a wide range of audiences, from the science fiction fanatic, to the men and women out for a piece of entertainment with pretty faces and sculpted bodies. It is at times a comedy, a drama, an action adventure, all spiked with horror, suspense and even spirituality.Worth your while. Highest of marks. Guaranteed to become a classic.",Serenity

I was ready to join collective Browncoats in sheer joy at the playing of this movie, and to come out singing its praises when the end credits rolled.Then the movie began.

One major inconsistency that irked me was ""sound in space"". What?! Firefly was vaunted for its realism of NO SOUND IN SPACE, which it held for most of the movie...and then all of a sudden, in a major FX sequence...there's sound?! And they were still in space!!!

622,hidarimaki,Movie stew,9,18 December 2005,"Some movies try to follow a strict formula, while other movies make due. This story is an action space movie while in the cockpit, except for some parts of space where it's a monster movie. And when the ship lands on a planet, it's suddenly a Western. But this is oversimplifying things somewhat.The ship which normally takes the heroes on their journey is often either state of the art (like the Millennium Falcon in Star Wars), or standard fare for space travel. The Serenity, which is the heroes' ship, is literally falling apart. The crew have the same devotion to each other as a dysfunctional family would (such as the Bundys in 'Married with Children'), except that not even blood ties this batch together. Their mission isn't to get rich, or to get famous, or to get even, but to get by. And the captain often has little idea what the next step is once he steps in, since basically they devise their plan as they go along.If this sounds familiar, the movie is a big screen adaptation of 'Firefly', the series which had almost as many quiet reschedulings as it had episodes, before being canceled with less than a full season behind it. So of course, they made the story ready for a theater release.But what's the oddest thing about 'Serenity'? Surprisingly, it's that it all works. This is a science fiction space action movie that doesn't take the space opera approach of the 'Star Wars' prequels, but of the original 1977 production which started the franchise. Despite the odd combination of elements, there's no point where you notice something and ask yourself ""what the heck is THAT doing in here?""In short, you don't have to be a fan of the original TV series to see this movie. What's presented here is a more complete and cohesive story than any episode of 'Firefly' was, and it's also self-contained. If you're a fan of the genre, this should be a safe bet.",Serenity

Too often these film makers are regurgitating things at us. (* In Example The Omen*)My Opinion on remakes aside , this was a fresh story that wasn't told over and over and over. Over all I really enjoyed some real believable characters in an imperfect universe with some real over the top action . Although not in the same league as Aliens or Blade Runner the film brings us a story that is at the very least entertaining. The Special effects here are no joke either.The real peach of this movie has to be the real relationships between the characters. I think that was the downfall of the entire 5 seasons of ""Enterprize"" . The Characters in the series felt hollow . There is none of that here , the writers threw in a good old dose of despicable and lovable pirate turned mercenary with a temperamental engineer and a Psychotic good girl passenger ... saying any more would ruin it ... it's a definite rental and I just added it to my collection this weekend .",Serenity
625,Prostheticwings,Do NOT watch this if you like Firefly,3,5 January 2007,"I was aware of Firefly for the last year or two but hadn't gotten around to watching the series and I wanted to before I saw the movie. I finally borrowed the box set off of a co-worker and watched all of the original episodes. I loved it almost immediately as it seems like most of you did. The worst part of watching the series was knowing that that box set was it and there wouldn't be anything more.If you haven't seen the movie don't bother reading the rest of this review. I wish I'd never seen Serenity as it may have ruined Firefly for me. I really recommend that people who loved Firefly just stay away from Serenity. It's different from the show and I personally feel that it's maliciously insulting to the show and the people that liked it. It will affect the way you view the Firefly episodes and may damage their re-watchability.SPOILERS START BELOW A day after finishing the last episode I ran out and rented Serenity to get my final fix of the Firefly universe. I was utterly and completely disappointed and wish I'd left it in the video store.The hokey camaraderie from the series was gone. The well-developed characters betrayed their nature repeatedly like they'd never been developed in the first place. The deaths of 2 crew members were inexcusably pointless. The warm photography and sets were gone.I felt something was wrong for most of the movie, I just couldn't get into it and wasn't nearly as involved as I was in every single Firefly episode. The turning point was the absurd killing of Wash. That was when I realized how much I'd been disliking the movie.The Firefly series went to considerable lengths to make sure the characters acted in accordance with their nature. Sure they 'grew' occasionally or surprised themselves but in general they stayed true to their personality. Joss Whedon threw all of that out the window in Serenity. The doctor is extremely protective of River but he lets her walk around in a bar as soon as they leave Serenity? They strap the bodies of Shepherd's dead friends to the outside of the spaceship? Jayne would have done that, probably Mal, maybe Zoe after some coaxing, but everyone else? Kaylee talking about sex with the doctor when they're all about to die? She freaks out anytime there's trouble but she has time for that? Mal taking River on the bank heist job? Come on!Wash dying was when I realized that Joss Whedon just didn't care. He'd been done with Firefly for a while in my opinion. But he'd be screwing himself over if he abandoned his Firefly fans at that point and refused to make a movie when it was offered to him. So he made one and his contempt for his fans and their adulation was as clear as day. Serenity was a slap in the face to everyone that loved Firefly. I'm just glad I didn't get caught up in the movement to save Firefly or I'd have been stomping mad after Serenity. I can look at the whole thing objectively because it's over and done with. I only waited a day between Firefly and Serenity instead of years like most fans.",Serenity

So it's a great shame that the albatross of the TV series hangs around the film's neck - as in, if you haven't seen one, don't bother seeing the other.The film rocks! Plain and simple. How many sci-fi films get made each year that are intended for grown-ups and not to cash-in on merchandise for the five-year-olds? Serenity, from start to finish, is the kind of film people should be queueing to see. In an ideal world...The plot, the characters, the wit, the action, on every level this film is excellent cinema. How many times have you sat in a cinema with a smile on your face because the film you're watching is THAT good? It's totally engaging and should be number one in the movie charts, but I think its cult status, especially on DVD, will give it the audience it deserves.But go and see it.

627,jdcorcor,"Outcasts, Iconoclasts and Classy callgirls fight the galactic Man, passive-aggressively and otherwise!",8,4 October 2005,"Joss Whedon faltered back in 2002 when his ""Firefly"" sci-fi TV series was canceled (despite his ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"" success track record). But Firefly lives again in this Sci-Fi movie hybrid of that very same television series mix-mastered with vintage Star Wars-type screen action/adventure fantasy. The good news is that the Sci-Fi Channel is now running the original 11 ""Firefly"" episodes from which this movie sprang, and each should feed the popularity of the other.Like the series, this movie is witty, it's wry, and it has frisky characters passively and otherwise resisting the MAN, in this case the galaxy-dominating Alliance. Its lethal agent and weapon of mass destruction is portrayed by Chiwetel Ejiofor, and he is splendid, deadly and single-minded.Our antihero, Captain Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds (a rough and ready Nathan Fillion), takes a licking and keeps on ticking. Picture a slightly skewed, sexier cowboy-take on Hans Solo with a Millennium Falcon that's a bucket of bolts. His strong right hand is Zoe (stunning Gina Torres)  Luke Skywalker as a tawny-skinned, assertive Amazon instead. Mal's prickly love interest is a gorgeous, bona fide companion (read high class call girl) with equally high self esteem, the elegant Inara (Morena Baccarin channeling an exotic young Elizabeth Taylor). The Wookie role of muscle-bound primate Jayne is tough guy Adam Baldwin. Jewel Staite is the R2D2 of the piece as Kaylee, a dewy-eyed, naïve engine mechanic. Alan Tudyk is a funny and appealing geek of a pilot, Wash, who is married to Zoe, I guess making him our C3PO as the less than macho member (""Oh God Oh God We're all going to die"" is sure to get a laugh from his delivery). The comparisons are not quite spot on, just convey that feeling. Gaining passage with the crew are a brother and sister desperate to stay beneath the Alliance's radar, Dr. Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and his disconnected, perhaps demented little sister, River Tam (Summer Glau), whose mental abilities are far beyond ordinary. Watch out for when that egg cracks open. Simon's medical skills pay his fare and allow his sister's peculiarities to be tolerated, despite Jayne's desire to ditch them at the first opportunity.""Serenity"" is not only the title of this movie, but it is (a) the name of the spaceship ""boat"" on which our ragtag bunch of planet hopping jacks-and-jills-of-all-trades travel, (b) An underlying theme for which they all hunger, and (c) a twist on what the Alliance purportedly seeks to achieve in the universe. We learn right out of the gate that the earth was recreated on various planets throughout the cosmos via terraforming after intergalactic war decimated our planet. The rebels lost but continue on in the attitudes of anti-establishment, independent separatists living on the fringes of society. The all-powerful Alliance now rules with a real iron hand in a phony velvet glove to keep the people calm and at peace, etc. Some terraformed New Earths have prospered while others struggle in reverted societies similar to our Old West. There is a mix of cultures and time periods in play, from civil-war era to high-tech gov centers bursting with lasers and mind control. There are saloons juxtaposed against stratospheric space battles, dusty desert landscapes versus full-bore mega-communication satellite complexes. What a mix.In a nutshell, the Alliance wants what Serenity has: River, the government-engineered, expensive prototype modified human who is carrying around in her mind-reading teenage brain all kinds of secret information they inadvertently made available to her. Her brother, the shy and stiff young doctor, is devoted to keeping her hidden and safe while he seeks a cure for her neurosis, psychosis and other screwed-up-Sis problems. Look for well-played lesser characters that are striking and memorable, if brief, in both Ron Glass as the sage Shepherd Book and wacky whizkid David Krumholtz as Mr. Universe. There are disturbing, soulless creatures called ""Reavers"" that have lost their humanity to such an extent they tear other humans limb to limb, and worse. They will surely keep you on edge in addition to the eerily calm and completely fear-inducing Ejiofor, whose character remains nameless throughout.Let's hope this fast-moving, fast-talking, establishment-kicking feature film helps the TV series comes back to life once more, as 11 episodes are simply not enough. Both ""Serenity"" and ""Firefly"" deserve a closer look on the big and little screens.",Serenity
628,nanette,We went back for more....,10,11 October 2005,"There's nothing I like more than excellent story-telling and Serenity is just that! We went to see it again, and it was better the second time. I dream of a return to TV of the Firefly series. Keep up the good work, Joss Whedon, and don't let the short-sighted 'Hollyweird' world discourage you. We search the world of entertainment for quality work. We very seldom find anything that attracts us. We dislike most reality shows, don't watch night-time soaps, and can't stomach another internal investigation of a corpse in detail...yuck! The never ending spew of low end offerings doesn't say much good about our culture. But hidden in the midst of such tripe...Firefly and Serenity twinkle like diamonds. Characters with souls and problems, adventure, imagination, plot lines with direction, and the weave of details. Everyone who worked to make it all flow together from the great writing down to the smallest stage trim contributed to a work of story-telling much appreciated out here in the dark.If you can't get your world back up on the small screen, keep making movies, and if that doesn't work...write us books. I'd love to see where your ideas and characters would go in the future.A Family of Fans... Nanette, Ken, Heather and McKenzie.",Serenity
629,migee529,Well well well,8,21 November 2005,"So I feel compelled to review serenity. I was a loyal viewer of Buffy and Angel, it got me through high school, Joss is one of the main reasons i want to be a screenwriter. I unfortunately though never watched Firefly when it was on, never even particularly cared for it either. Then I heard it was being made into a movie. I saw it opening day with a friend who happens to be a ""brown coat"". It was fantastic. The writing was everything i wanted in more. The Special Effects were amazing and only used when necessary, something that most movies forget about nowadays and was incredibly refreshing to see. As a film student and hopefully future film critic...obviously the movie has a few flaws, but they're so few and far between you can look over them easily. Its a shame to see that its coming out on DVD so soon, I wish it had done better in theatres, only because its a film that needs to be experienced on the big screen in all of its glory. Even if your not a sci fi fan, which i don't consider myself to be, your bound to have a good time with this.",Serenity
630,shodanjon,Great story and action. Just a terrific movie.,10,30 September 2005,"Like most of America, I didn't watch Firefly when it first came out. Fox canceled it before I got a chance to get hooked. My bad. But I would have only been more angry when Fox pulled the plug so it's a mixed bag.This movie follows the action in the episodes that were made (and are available on DVD) and fills in some backstory via flashbacks and dialog. Whedon has done a great job with the story and everything that happens has a purpose and is right in line with the story.If your not a Firefly fan, then this might seem like just another science fiction movie that hit the big screen in early autumn. But you'd be selling it short; this is a great story with lots of action. The dialogue snaps, there's humor and pathos. The good guys do incredible stuff and make mistakes, in short, they're human. The bad guys are amazingly evil and make no apologies for being so. This is just a well done movie and great story.If you are a Firefly fan then you'll either have already seen it or you're on your way. For me, it was just great to see these characters again. I really like this movie. I'll see it again on the big screen and I'll buy the DVD when it comes out. It's definitely worth your time.",Serenity
631,tangarang,Wow...,10,2 October 2005,"OK, so this was A LOT better than I thought it'd be. I loved the show on TV and I was stoked when I heard it was gonna be a movie. However, I was afraid it would kinda be bad. It rocks that they had all of the same cast and the writing was great! I do have one question though (and this is a spoiler, so if you haven't seen it, then stop reading this right here!!!): why did they kill Wash?? That was unnecessary I think; I don't see the reason for it. I didn't like the Shepherd being killed either, but I saw that one coming. I don't know, but I wanted them to live, so that maybe Firefly could come back to TV!! :) If you haven't seen it though, you should, cuz it rocks.",Serenity
632,showem,Only okay for someone who hasn't seen the TV series.,6,5 July 2007,"I've never seen the Firefly TV series, nor heard much about it. However, Serenity was on TV and I thought I would watch it. It was okay, but it wasn't fantastic. Characters were interesting and it was easy enough to accept their relationships right from the start. However it was very wordy and the plot wasn't the strongest. Lots of nice action sequences, but I was reminded of other movies (Star Wars series, Equilibrium, 28 Days Later..., etc) at several points; as if the scenes and plot were scripted after watching those films. None the less, it was decent entertainment, but certainly not worth the 8 rating is has on IMDb. If you don't know the Firefly series, you might enjoy it, but don't expect too much.",Serenity
633,blindvv00d,Lack of Character Development,4,1 November 2005,"Not much character development. I guessed you'll praise it lavishly if you're a fan of the TV-series Firefly, but its just an average flick if you're not familiar with the TV series. There is hardly any chemistry among the characters that.. its hard to get any emotional attachment to the character at all.The movie come off as being a bit confusing for me as I was expecting a relaxing and enjoyable bit of sci-fi movie. Actually, I did enjoy a few minutes of nap. Some parts are just plain boring that it puts you to sleep. Maybe I'm expecting too much out of this movie. I'm rating it 4/10 because I really didn't enjoy it as much.Sorry for the fans out there.",Serenity
634,truedis,"Coming from a big fan of the show, this movie pretty much sucks...",5,10 October 2005,"I saw this after being skeptical, but seeing the high rating on IMDb. I've now come to realize this is most certainly what is known as the ""fanboy"" effect. This movie has a meandering plot, a less-than-stellar conclusion, and is filled with goofy, pointless dialog. Something I enjoyed about the show was how varied the plot lines were and how the characters interacted differently in every episode. In this movie, everyone was very one-dimensional extremes of their characters in the show, and they didn't develop at all throughout the whole thing! The plot just sort of went nowhere until you found out the big ""oh no"" about the alliance (which didn't seem all that big to me...). Overall this movie was a total bust, and I'm embarrassed that I took my girlfriend with me to see it, in the hopes that I could quell her constant mockery about the fact that I wanted to see it, and clearly I failed in that regard.",Serenity

636,n9fzx,"The ""Star Wars"" of a New Generation",9,30 September 2005,"Somewhere, towards the end of this movie, I said to myself ""this is what Star Wars felt like when I was a kid"". Gritty, outer space science fiction, with characters I could relate to, humor, a classic story, real effects. What a contrast to the most recent products of the Star Wars line -- Jar-Jar Binks, must I say more?Credit Joss Whedon for not giving up when Fox botched Firefly, a show which could have revitalized the television science fiction genre. Fortunately, he's done just that for the cinema. I hope Serenity sees enough commercial success to rival that of the Star Wars or Star Trek franchises, we want more!",Serenity
637,subscriptions,Entertaining but unexceptional,7,9 October 2005,"I'm not familiar with Joss Whedon's other work, but many people have recommended it and I was looking forward to discovering a great writer/director in this movie. However, while Serenity is an enjoyable film, neither the writing nor the directing is of exceptional quality. The plot is simple and reasonably compelling, but does not stand out from others in the genre, and it contains perhaps more than its fair share of unlikely timings, unreasonable decisions, and clichés. I also did not feel that any of the characters were particularly well developed, as uninterrupted flow of conversation seemed to take higher priority than developing character integrity. The most exceptional feature was the good taste displayed in choosing attractive women to play key roles.Serenity is just another entertaining action flick. I do not believe it will be remembered a decade from now.",Serenity
638,mcpnet,Summer Glau rocks,10,9 January 2006,Summer Glau who plays River on the series and in the movie rocks.Thereis one scene that steals the show.Anyone who has scene this movie knows what i am talking about.Her innocence and grace was genuine ...but her action scenes are fantastic.I have scene this 3 times already and I am buying the Widescreen DVD This reminded me of the old TOS Star Trek with the action and story.It ties everything from the series in tight little comprehensive bundle.I loved Serenity and hope they make a sequel and bring the show back under the new name with the orchestral score instead of the voice singing score.I found that a good orchestral score stays in the minds of viewers and they can relate to the program.That was one of the reasons for ST Enterprise's demise.An orchesral theme is much more memorable than a singing intro.,Serenity

640,clint-609-303030,I just don't get it ????,2,30 May 2010,"I had an opportunity to watch Serenity last night and after reading such glowing reviews on IMDb I thought I'd check it out. Did I miss something? 8 out of 10 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I gave up about three quarters of the way through this absolute turd of a film. At best this was capable of being labeled as 'B-Grade television'. The acting was poor, the story and characters were weak and the effects were ordinary to say the least. I just cannot conceive why so many people would rave about this. In fact to make me cringe even more, in one review someone likened it to the amazement one would have felt when watching Star Wars for the first time. Shame on you for comparing this pile of steaming crap with one of the greatest movies ever made!! I really put a lot of faith in IMDb's rating system as most of the time it is very accurate but not with this one. Absolute garbage - don't waste your time.",Serenity
641,AgentCool,Great but not Legendary,7,10 October 2005,"There are plenty of reviews for 'Serenity' on IMDb so I'll spare you the obligatory plot line lowdown and simply give you my opinion.Many people have been saying this is the ""new Star Wars"" and it's good enough to start a franchise. Whilst I agree that this film was better than the average sci-fi picture, it certainly isn't anywhere near as interesting, funny, awe-inspiring or inventive as Star Wars. In fact, I would risk saying this was the most clichéd movie I have seen this year. It has them all; old man dying scene, mysterious psychic, witty captain, mostly under-25 cast, thrown in romantic subplot, and a hilarious climactic fight that had almost every event from TV's 'Gladiators' rolled into one. The other problem is that it never feels like a proper feature film and newcomers, like myself, to 'Firefly' will feel left out. There's never any proper character introduction and I could barely remember any of the character's names by the end credits, nor did I really care about any of them during the running time. Again, this probably has more to do with me having not seen the TV show than bad writing.However, despite these weaknesses the film as a whole works pretty well and the dialogue and plot are decent enough to keep you watching for the full 2 hours. Part of this impression comes from the fact that the opening 25 minutes or so are pretty dull and uninspiring so when the real meat and potatoes arrives you become much more interested. I spent most of the first hour trying to figure out what was going on but in the end this turned out to be the best thing about the film; it keeps you thinking and will most definitely warrant repeat viewings to further understand the plot and more specifically, the characters.I must warn you though, this film is not for everyone. Somebody I went to see this with fell asleep for 20 minutes and he doesn't often do that. If you want something full of action then you'll be disappointed, at least for most of the ride. If you want a sci-fi film that will keep you thinking then this might be for you. However, I would recommend you see the TV series first. I didn't and it made the film not so much less enjoyable as alienating.",Serenity
642,ezd21,Redemption at Last!,10,30 September 2005,"Being a fan of Firefly since the beginning, I had high hopes for this movie. Ever since the series was cancelled before it got its rightful chance by the ignorant, ""I Love Singing and Dancing"" television network, who will remain nameless ( FOX ), I have waited patiently for the revival of this space-western masterpiece. This film is a testament to what happens when a great idea is pushed passed the limits that most would dare to go. It becomes one of my favorite movies of all time. Joss, you should bathe in the knowledge that you have done something that goes beyond what most expect. You pulled us in with Firelfy, and when that candle blew out, you reeled us back in with Serenity. Hopefully, more is yet to come, but the first round goes to you. Keep the candle burning, and may it shine as an example for all to follow. To those who have not yet seen it, tell that boss or anyone who stands in your way from seeing the movie, get out of my way because I am going to see history in the making, but you're more than welcome to come along.

I had to check what actors were in it to make sure I wasn't mistaken. I couldn't believe it. How can this be almost 8/10? It was truly awful. One of the worst movies I've seen and I only managed 15 minutes into it. I was not going to waste anymore time on it. The acting was terrible and the story was so predictable.

644,NeoDeMover,Very Good SciFi movie,9,26 November 2005,"This is perhaps the best SciFi movie all year, finally... that I can honestly think of? Hope this shows how stupid FOX looks, AGAIN about killing of the Firefly series.Everyone who has seen the DVD (I have lent them to several people) have fallen in love with it, many have bought their own DVDs! Now, the movie itself is NOT exactly GREAT compare to Firefly because its based on such solid characters and universe. It doesn't have the the story arcs of a TV series (look how well Joss has done with Buffy) Make sure if people start talking about the movie, and you haven't seen it yet - tell them to stop and walk away. What you will see is bigger sets and better special effects. Still, its the story and characters that count here. The first 10 or so minutes pretty much re-caps the setup of characters, but its needed for people who haven't seen the TV series... yet very well done still. Also nice is the walk-thru of the Serenity space-ship - very much like from the TV series. The inside is also better detailed.Try to borrow or buy the DVD before the movie, it'll allow the characters to grow on you much more and the movie makes a lot more sense (Again, well done for those who haven't seen it)... its well worth the $35~45 for the box set.To this day, the opening credits of the TV series and Movie puts a lump in my throat... is so good. ;) Even my new GF - who I had her watch the whole box set (she love it) sings or hums the opening song a lot ;)",Serenity

I found Firefly to be , was a truly great scifi show. Great stories, great characters, a real western in space. Amped by this brilliant series, I settled in to watch Serenity.Bad mistake.I stayed through the total tone change from the series and I sat through the blatant story changes and continuity juggling. But half way through I got severely Whedoned.Yes, Joss ""Shark Jumper"" Whedon has gone for the record on this one. A government conspiracy kidnap one of the greatest human minds. Why? to turn her into a master tactician or a human computer or a Telekinetic superhuman? NO. This Galactic Government armed with the most advanced weapons and armies of soldiers at its disposal rewired this genius brain to turn her into Jet Li. Why does the galactic government need a female amnesiac Jet Li? I don't know. Maybe they have the real Jet Li frozen somewhere and want a mating pair. Maybe the Emperor has a thing for amnesiac chicks who can beat him up. Maybe we'll find out at some future time, but I doubt it.Then they killed my favorite character.They made me love him, then they killed him.And it was totally unnecessary.

646,AndroideParanoide,"Overrated because of firefly fans, weak story",5,23 June 2016,"The movie begings showing good potential, interesting takes and scenery and a promising plot, but as it develops it fails to provide a decent story.The movie was filmed with no still camera, and the picture is always on constant movement. I can say that while i found interesting the way it was filmed, i would never like to see all other movies filmed this way, but for something different once its okay and it created its own brand on that.The characters are strange, you don't get the sense of a team, and also don't get attached to any of them, they acted all weird, they could all die at the end and you won't even care. The captain is always trying to do some sort of heroic speech that is too annoying and without any sense at all.There some many plot holes and forced scenes that its just hard to keep watching the movie.I will list some senseless scenes below be aware of spoilers.SPOILERS-SPOILERS-SPOILERS-SPOILERS-SPOILERS-SPOILERS-SPOILERS1. Miranda sorrounded by reavers: They have like the whole damn universe, that is mostly filled by empty space, and they don't have an option but to pass right straight at 100 meters from the big enemy spaceship? That is just so irritating, they could have just taken any other route.2. The alliance knew where some reaver were concentrating but they were skipping that part of the galaxy instead of going there to destroy them? where is the logic in that? Alliance would be very interested on erasing the reavers.3. They get to their friend's shepherd location too late.. but just soon enough to listen to his list last words? I don't know why they keep doing things like that. 4. The psychic girl could have fight every enemy the whole time, but never do it until the end of the movie. Right, let's get your friends and brother injured or killed first..5.River may have known many secrets from too many people, basically, anyone who was near hear could have fed her with memories and information.

647,talbots2010,You love the characters,8,22 February 2006,"This genre-bending, brilliantly witty, moving, exciting, involving and funny trip successfully melds sci-fi and Western conceits, making a story that's not only exemplary in each field, but transcends both. It took me right back to that thrill of the exotic & romantic that was first seen on screen in the bar scene in the very first Star Wars, and has hardly ever been equaled in any movie since. Although nowhere near so grand in scope (obviously; it's not aiming for that), in the seamless creation of a world and characters in whom you can get deeply invested almost immediately.The movie did, of course, entice me to by the Firefly DVD set. And while it might help to have a liking for sci-fi, I don't think even that is a necessity -- anyone who just likes thrillers of any kind should at least be open to the possibility of not just liking but totally falling for this awe-inspiring work.",Serenity
648,csulpw,A satisfying conclusion to a fantastic series,9,17 January 2012,"Serenity is one of those films I can watch anytime. I missed out on Firefly when it aired, but caught up on the first season once I got older. My opinions of the show aside, Serenity expands on the lore and provides proper closure to the series. In addition, it stands alone well for new viewers with a smooth transition in introducing the world and characters again and continuing the show's arc.The draw to Serenity is the characters, and though some argue that it's hard to connect to them in a 2 hour span, Whedon really did this movie as a fan service. I recommend watching the first season. Truth is, I could watch Mal and his crew on adventures all day long, but I digress.As a fan of Firefly, Serenity was a well thought-out, emotional, smart, and fun closure to the series. All of the characters are re-introduced, and we finally get to see River's full potential as a smart and deadly weapon (something the show began to explore before it got canceled). The Alliance is broadcast well here. The show always cast them as this cold, totalitarian government, but with enough evidence to argue against them being completely corrupt or evil. Their actions are shown as monstrous in the story (River, Reaver origin story - more on that, etc), but Whedon was smart to write in the Operative (played by the awesome and underrated Chiwetel Ejiofor), who provided some distance from them. He used their full resources, but took the accountability of their actions (killing children, Mr. Universe, etc), and this was shown through his immovable belief that he had to capture the Tams by any means necessary to achieve his perfect Universe. What ultimately wins out (for Mal/Crew and the viewer), is that Mal wins by proving the Operative wrong and changing his belief. This never happens in movies. Enemies are usually one-sided and un-swayed by logic or rationality, and where as a normal enemy would give the kill order due to bashed pride and ego, the Operative realizes his wrongness and spares the crew. It's an interesting commentary on belief and argument. Do people admit to logical fallacies when presented with supporting evidence from the other side? Hmm...There were several things I took issue with. First of all, killing Wash and Book off. Book made sense to me at first. He was a supporting character who ended up on the receiving end for Mal. He was an unfortunate casualty of someone else's fight. Wash rubbed me the wrong way. Undoubtedly the comic relief of the cast, he went in such a horrible way, and I felt there was inadequate mourning over him. The truth here had to do with contracts and green lighting sequels meaning Whedon didn't plan on writing them out beforehand, and knowing we aren't getting a sequel, this bugs me even more. For those who haven't seen the series, watch this movie. It has some great special effects, great characters, drama, action, and writing. The Reaver origin story is done well, and all sides are given some depth and exploration.For those who've just seen the movie or are on the fence, watch the series. It really is fantastic and it holds up well today.",Serenity
649,CharlieCalvert,Sleep inducing right wing propaganda,4,1 October 2005,"This is one of those movies in which there are no fully formed characters, little conversation, and endless violence. The theme of the movie is also a fairly straight forward instance of right wing propaganda. The core seed of the film is that people who want peace are destroying the world by creating hyper-violence. (I know, it doesn't make any sense.) In particular, the people who want peace are trying to do so by giving everyone a drug called Pax (latin for peace.) According to the movie, the drug suppresses people's natural and healthful impulse toward aggression, and thus makes them hyper-violent. I really prefer the right wing when they are in their WMD and yellow cake mode. That kind of propaganda may be based on lies, but at least it makes sense. The idea that a longing for peace generates violence is just silly, and contradicts everything we read in the New Testament.The second major theme of the movie is that violence is the solution to all problems and that it is okay to do really, really bad things if you feel threatened. (But don't forget it is the people in this world who want peace who are really responsible for creating all this violence! What?) Most of the acting in this movie is poor, though Summer Glau turns in an interesting performance. She is also an extraordinarily graceful and lithe woman. Just watching her move is a pleasure, but the director doesn't seem to be aware of that fact. Jewel Staite seems to have some real acting ability, and she is very winning. I'd like to see her in a comedy where she has a chance to stretch out a little. There were moments in this movie where she seemed to flicker into life for a few seconds, but everything around her was shrouded in such a deep, somnambulant haze that it was hard to tell for sure.The primary problem with this movie is that it is overly long. I was yawning throughout much of the movie, and so was the person beside me.",Serenity

Fans of the TV series will probably have to see the movie a couple of times to absorb everything that happens.As for the non-fans, the ones at the screening I attended seemed to like Serenity as much as us Browncoats. They laughed in all the right places, gasped in all the right places ... were stunned into silence in all the right places. Sure, they didn't have the same level of emotional attachment/reaction as we Browncoats, but the one thing that was heard repeatedly when the end credits rolled was: ""Now I have to see the series.""

651,NYPinTA,Go see Serenity. Trust me.,9,7 October 2005,"I was a big fan of the TV show that it is based on, but in a way I'm jealous of anyone who is going to see the movie that wasn't already familiar with the Firefly universe because as a fan, there were certain things I was looking for and sometimes that can be distracting. The movie is very accessible to anyone who hasn't seen the TV show so if you are concerned that you might get lost because you hadn't seen the show, don't be. Go see the movie. Trust me. It had fantastic dialogue, great visuals, and gorgeous music. It was beautiful when it needed to be, ugly when necessary, funny, sad, and exciting. It was everything a movie like this should be! And most important (at least for me), it was surprising. Too many movies are so obvious you already know how it will end before it is half over. But not this one. There is a scene where Sheppard Book says to Mal, ""They'll come at you sideways."" Well, Joss does too. He does the unexpected and it just rocks. This isn't a warm and fuzzy action adventure. People are at risk; nothing is sacred, nothing safe. I love that. I even thought to myself more than once, 'why couldn't George Lucas do it like this?' I saw Star Wars Episode III and was (sadly) bored to tears by the opening sequence. Never once was I bored with Serenity. I was clutching my seat, gasping in shock along with everyone else in the theater. And when it was over, they audience applauded, in a movie theater. What does that tell you? Also, even as a woman I can say this without jealousy, but Gina Torres is gorgeous in this film. She needs to be in more movies. I'll be seeing it again next weekend. I suggest you all do the same.",Serenity

Very mean and barbaric characters which supposedly are good, cliché lawful bad guy with English accent - "" So posh !"" and every idea of a film put together. We see steampunk-cowboy-1800s theme mixed with Minority Report and Farscape themes, that don't have any correlation and logic. Frustrating violent scenes that are there just because it's supposed to be entertaining, evil-good creepy goth girl with superpowers, with no feels and personality - VERY ORIGINAL and a captain that is more of a pirate.Plot holes galore - i'm not a fan of technobabble but this movies plot has the logic of a giraffe on steroids. If they are the heroes why didn't they invent a cure for the Reavers? Wait..they are mutants and we must kill them because we just want to entertain some edgy teens.Review summary: waste of 2 hours, for the sci fi enthusiasts i recommend Enemy Mine instead of this garbage.",Serenity

I didn't recognize many of the actors, but they were all great. This movie had everything, a great story, lots of action, family loyalty, and a little romance. The characters were excellent and all had a part in creating the story. I was left with the feeling that a sequel may follow.

It is just as good as the series(but possibly not as good as some of the better episodes). If you haven't seen Firefly you should do that before you watch Serenity. Serenity is a great continuation of the series. Serenity has enough action to keep you interested throughout the entire movie. There is also plenty of the witty exchanges that is generally seen in Joss Whedon's work. Serenity has possibly the best fight scene ever as well as some of the wittiest dialogue. This movie is fantastic especially considering it's low budget and less than stellar reception at the box office.

I regret that the Western character of firefly was lessened in Serenity, however the sci-fi, action, humor, and romantic elements were all there. This movie really wraps-up loose plot threads form firefly and be prepared for a few surprises too (like Wash getting killed). I really hope that there will be another firefly series. The Sci-fi channel handled the show really well in syndication. As long as the new series isn't mismanaged by cable networks as it was when it originally came out, I am sure it will be a big hit. There was certainly enough foreshadowing or eluding to such a possibility as the characters said 'its not over yet.'",Serenity
656,webd_sine,Fantastic Film,10,1 January 2006,"Star Wars for grown ups - a fantastic film in all departments.The battle sequence was out of this world and having real baddies in a sci-fi without having a speech impediment and plastic buckets on their heads was a breath of fresh air.The whole film had a credible story to it, the acting was first class and clearly showed the cast really enjoyed making this movie. The sharp, intelligent humour was the cherry on the top of this tasty cake. Congratulations Joss, this truly lives up to it's Film 2005 winner status. We want a sequel !!!!PS - Don't forget to add February 27, 2006 into your diary, this is the UK DVD release date - (Amazon UK are taking pre orders)",Serenity
657,jayk_bakner,This generation's Star Wars? No...but the franchise came so close!,9,1 March 2006,"It's not everyday that I have my expectations completely blown away. And this movie came along and did it.When I first heard of Serenity, back in early 2005, I was a little dubious about it. Particularly with the semi-corny internet banners, advertising it as 'this generation's Star Wars' and suggesting stereo-typical characters 'the fugitive, the pilot, the captain' etc. Now, I'm an enormous Star Wars fan, and almost EVERY movie this has been said about has been utterly awful. So I dismissed Serenity almost immediately. Then, one gloomy weekend in late 2005, I decided to go to the cinema to see SOMETHING. The only thing on? Serenity. 'Well,' I thought to myself, 'may as well!' And in I headed.I wasn't too impressed in the beginning, the acting of the main ensemble seemed a little forced, even with the impressive long cut that introduces us to them. But it only got better. They fell into their characters perfectly, and as the movie progressed, they display a brilliant array of emotions; humour, hopelessness, the whole works! And the action! What action! The three major fist fights were some of the most visceral I had seen all year (this was a year with Batman Begins and Ong Bak, just so you know!). The chase scene was just exhilarating, and the space battle beat out Episode III's effort by miles. The occasional bit of gun play was well placed, and well played out.Other great things; the dialogue. Some truly classic lines; perfectly delivered by the cast. I particularly enjoyed the exchanges between Mal and the Operative, as they felt perfectly natural ways in which two mortal enemies might talk! Also, the story, whilst a little bit convoluted - you do have to stay awake and keep up - was fantastic, if only a little bit clichéd.Also, the special effects. I loved the way that they had an almost hand-held feeling about them, as if they were actually happening, and there was a guy with a camera trying to catch it all on tape. They just felt so REAL, and the characters blended in perfectly.I only have two gripes with the movie. First off, the performances of the main ensemble start of VERY slow, and it feels a little awkward right at the start of the movie. The other is that, as I said, the story is a little bit confusing, and it does require 2 viewings to fully get what's going on.So, all-in-all, I'd thoroughly recommend this film to anyone, as it has everything; humour, drama and action! What more could you need! And Universal...can we have a big damn trilogy? PLEEEASE!!!! 9/10",Serenity
658,angelys,So very excellent it's almost too good!,10,3 September 2005,"I saw, last Thursday, the press screening of the Serenity movie. I have to admit that at first, I was all excited, yes, but in my head it was just like any other good movie that I saw, except now I was seeing it before anyone else would see it. Well... I was wrong. It's not just like any other movie, it is BETTER. Way better. Joss Wheldon have a way to keep us captivated, to make us so anxious, yet laughing at the same time with those great dialogues. Always something to make us burst out laughing. Also, it is always full of action, no dull or boring moment. There's always something interesting to see.There's also one particular shock in the movie that made the whole theater lose their breath at the exact same moment, I won't say what it is, but I am still under the shock. I can't believe this happened, and as much as I know that it was needed to give even more effect to the movie, I am feeling sad about it.The movie is turning more around River. Showing more what happened to her, explaining a lot of things that I didn't understand in the series.So, if you want a good laugh, and at the same time, to see a good action movie, with sad moments and happier ones, you should indeed see it. I already saw it and I am planning to go see it again when it will be out, and probably one or two more times. It is really one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I don't believe that anyone will be disappointed in it.Go see it. It's a must.",Serenity
659,g_alan_e,"Wow, just wow.",10,1 October 2005,"I won't go into all the back story in the series and characters. There's 26 or more pages of comments on here already that cover it all.What ""Serenity"" delivers is the ""man behind the curtain"" about the reavers, while it totally misses giving any details about other mysteries from the series. It also stirs up some new things that'll make you desperately want to see the next film.If you were expecting revelations about BLUE SUN and why River Tam had such a destructive fascination towards things with the logo, such as the food cans and Jayne's shirt, there's only a single item in the whole movie with the BLUE SUN logo. (I made a fancy BLUE SUN shirt and wore it to the movie!) The ""two by two, hands of blue"" guys with their brain blasting weapon also are not in the movie.If you haven't seen the series, you've no idea what I'm on about, if you've seen the series, you won't miss BLUE SUN or the blue handed men. There's so much else going on you won't have time to worry/think about them! There's a scene where you get whip-lashed from elation to despair so complete that everyone in the theater will go dead silent. Some viewers may even cry, so bring extra tissues! River is in a pair of fight scenes that make Jackie Chan and Jet Li's best look like musical dance scenes. She's graceful while kicking butt against multiple attackers. In the first, she's only in ""defense mode"" while in the second she's full-on berserker VS a shipload of reavers, wielding a sword and battle axe. No silly wire-work or ""bullet time"" or impossible moves, just gritty hand to hand and mêlée fighting.What made it even better was the 21 screen theater I went to had it on two screens (40 feet tall! Almost as good as IMAX.) and every screening was sold out all day Friday! Hopefully they'll have to put it onto one or two more to handle the demand.",Serenity
660,nhagnew,serenity now,6,1 April 2013,"When a personality is forced onto an innocent girl with a gift, she uses that gift to fight back. With the help of a few talented rebels, this movie had everything Star Wars had with out some of the puppets.Although its the lowest review I've ever given, it's only because it looked like a made for TV Sci- Fi adaptation of Cowboy Bebop.I wouldn't pass it by because of its digital simplicity however, as the characters and plot enter into the realm the fertile arena of space government.Although one can not know everything, it would be a delight to endure many years getting a space masters in intergalactic dominion policy of the Christian empire featured in this film.How do they cope with the theological debates of execution, totalitarianism vs. forgiveness, a human God centered moral in an alien inhabited universe?So many questions I have for the space cowboy who doesn't smoke cigarettes, why not?",Serenity
661,fan-33,"Joss Whedon delivers with an intelligent Sci Fi set in the future, in a universe where earth's been destroyed, and the survivors are living under the evil Alliance.",10,2 October 2005,"I loved Firefly which was closed down by Fox before Joss Whedon had finished telling his story. Joss is a story teller who takes us on the journey with him. This journey is an adventure, which appeals to both sexes. The dialogue is witty, and memorable in the usual Joss style.Serenity explores the character, River, who we met in the TV series Firefly, and we learn why she is so damaged. Summer Glau who plays River is a talented actress and a wonderful ballet dancer, although she doesn't dance in Serenity, but her training in both ballet and martial arts is used to great effect, but it is the expressions on her face, which she uses to communicate non verbally, which are just wonderful.The rest of the crew of Firefly are there again, and while those who haven't seen Firefly, and have not yet learned to love these characters, the dangers they face, will not have the same impact as they do on those who are familiar with them, but you will enjoy the story telling, because we are being drawn into Joss's universe, called ""the 'verse"" in Serenity speak. The rest of the cast play their parts with the same passion they gave to the doomed ""Firefly"" which I recommend everyone buy on DVD.This is Joss Whedon giving his all once again, as he did with Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel and Firefly. Joss Whedon is legendary.Don't miss this movie. If you are a Sci Fi fan, or love comedies, or Cowboy movies, or movies that can make you laugh and cry at the same time, this movie is for you.The ensemble cast are believable, and endearing, the villains are clever, and believable too. This is an epic story, of a Universe where freedom is almost gone, and the rebel crew of ""Serenity"" are fighting a battle for survival, not just for themselves, but for humanity itself. If you haven't seen the TV series Firefly, don't worry, you will soon understand what is going on, but if you have seen Firefly, the movie will have a greater impact on you. justbrowsing",Serenity
662,osm-1,"Average ""for teen"" movie with some SFX",4,17 October 2005,"Simply can't understand why this movie in Top250.Yes, there are some SFXs, but none too spectacular. There is a plot, but unfortunately it's too weak. The plot for the second half of the movie is just boring.Characters are too flat.There's no logic at all in plot and all the character play. Jokes are at 12-year-old level.So the movie is obviously targeted at teenagers. Director is making a good job of transmitting some popular-with-teens images onto Lucas ground. Nothing more.So, I can recommend this movie as an example of the excellent use of BTL budget only. 4 out of 10.",Serenity
663,ffbadd,I love This Movie,10,16 September 2006,"I really do... I don't know how to explain why I just do. I don't know if everyone knows the history of this movie but it is the end or new beginning of a TV show called Firefly. Before I saw this movie I wouldn't have cared to see the show at all. But now that I own this movie I have watched it a couples of times. Most movies after watching them a few times you can get kinda bored with the movie or end up hating them. Well I don't feel that way with this movie. To me it is a new, refreshing movie that helps Sci-fi movies look even better. Oh god this movie is fun it's got the action, romance, uh zombies I mean that's all you need right? Oh and it's even got comedy and not that stupid ""Dude Where's My Car?"" humor.",Serenity
664,tuckerman,"This newbie found it good, solid, entertaining space opera",9,7 October 2005,"Just got back from seeing Serenity. I never saw the TV show, but I read the non-spoiler comments posted here first, so I did have some background.I found it to be fairly fast paced, the plot really did tie everything together pretty well, and I only had to suspend disbelief a very few times.Good quality space battles, no ""cartoonish"" aliens, and enough chuckles and laughs to lighten it up.The ""mushy"" bits were mercifully short and well spread-out, but you found out pretty much how the characters felt about each other. They had enough depth for me.The one thing that pssed me off is that when you have to ""secure for a rough landing (or take off)"", you really should PUT THE DAMNED DISHES AWAY! What the HELL is up with having a well-set dinner table and knickknacks sitting around in a space ship!?! Yeah, it makes it ""homey"", but give me a break. Artificial gravity my butt, this little set-design foobar cost a point off my vote.",Serenity
665,allensmyth,Sigh... typical,10,2 May 2006,"As a long standing sci-fi fan, all I wanted to say is that the usual fate for most sci-fi shows was inflicted on this one... short showing followed by cancellation. VERY few make it. When will the networks understand that sci-fi needs TIME to establish itself and get a fan base so that the ratings will bloom? Geez, even Star Trek (the original)was cancelled before the ratings took off. Wonderful productions like Farscape and Serenity just don't have a chance. Especially since the networks love screening them at impossible times (usually after 10pm). Farscape was cancelled in Australia because they showed it late and it didn't get huge ratings. Well DUH... they showed it while the Sydney Olympics were on! HELLO!!!Enjoy the episodes they did make. The characters are all different and at times unpredictable. Even the language is quirky and fun. Plus, I loved the ship! I suppose that this imaginative and at times quite funny series will now be banished to sci-fi conventions and die-hard fanhood. Oh well.",Serenity
666,lucanolasco,forget about it,4,7 October 2005,"There is no much to say about Serenity: Dull, maybe is the best! It is a ""simple"" film with no particularly intriguing story, no strong emotions, no big suspense and no brilliant special effect.If you take Buffy ""The vampire whatever"" and place it in the space, in the future there we are! We've got Serenity!The most exciting fighting was my own personal against myself to stay awake! The actors gave an average performance; no one was very bad or very good very pretty/handsome or ugly. No character was very nasty evil or Jesus good again and again the plane feelings win.The film was not even bad enough to push me out of the theatre.This is the film's major guilt it is a film without a heart, without a soul, without a brain a mere commercial exercise.",Serenity
667,justicegirl,Serenity Afterglow,10,1 September 2005,"**Spoiler-free review** I saw Serenity last night at an advance screening. I woke up this morning still smiling.In the interest of full disclosure, I should say that I've been a fan of the TV show Firefly, that the movie was based on. Even so, I think that people seeing it for the first time and people who are already familiar with the back story will both enjoy the heck out of this movie.The dialogue and the acting are the two strongest elements of the movie. Although you may only recognize a couple of names of the actors, like Alan Tudyk and Gina Torres, you can be sure you'll be seeing their profiles rise soon. Especially Nathan Fillion, who plays Captain Malcolm Reynolds. He's got dramatic and comedic acting chops, and both are given a chance to shine in this movie.It helps that the movie was written and directed by Joss Whedon, the king of the one-liners. They aren't just throwaway lines thoughthey always contribute to character and plot development. The plot is pretty straightforward, and doesn't assume you know anything from the TV show. Though if you've seen the TV show, some of what happens, both good and bad, will carry some extra meaning.Most of the effects are also quite good. Although I felt that a couple of the action sequences felt a little staged, overall, the fight scenes and digital effects were well-rendered. This is not a sanitized Star Trek experience, and the effects and camera work reflect this. The ship that the characters live on, and where much of the movie takes place, has a run-down, gritty feel, by design, almost like a submarine.In short: Serenity was awesome. I laughed a lot, I cried a little, and I'm definitely going to see it again. I hope you give it a chance. Sit back in your comfy theater chair, snack on your popcorn, and enjoy the ride.",Serenity
668,froglips111302,Serenity is fantastic.,10,3 October 2005,"I came late to Firefly, but was hooked after the first episode.This movie is FANTASTIC! It reunites a great ensemble cast and shows what potential the show has.Its fun, funny, sad and thrilling. All things Joss is known for.The way Joss wrote filling in the back story was not only clever, but gave fans even more insight into character history. You can enjoy this show with or without having seen the TV series.Of course, if you haven't seen the TV series, you will want to ASAP.Kudos to the cast. They reprised their roles as if they had never been apart. Its just a delight.Try to catch in theaters, there are some great big screen moments.Thanks to the cast, crew and Joss. You continue to make me smile.",Serenity
669,rad1701,Superb movie for the fans and others!,10,1 October 2005,"Saw the new ""Serenity"" movie last night (opening day) and just loved it! Joss Whedon expands the ""Firefly"" universe and characters greatly in the span of a two hour movie. The movie has it all: action, humor, suspense, sadness, hope, --- it's a roller-coaster ride of scenes and emotional images. Fans of the 14 episode TV series will love this movie greatly. Even those not familiar with the ""Verse"" of Firefly will enjoy this high energy Sci-Fi romp. The movie also has a very well drawn bad guy that isn't your typical cardboard villain. Take anyone you know that likes adventure and fighting for a worthy cause to see this movie. You won't be disappointed. :)",Serenity
670,jack-upland,Too Derivative,6,30 September 2005,"I know that ""Star Wars"" is not the be-all and end-all of SF movies, but for me ""Serenity"" was too derivative of this inevitable benchmark. Here the Empire is replaced by the Alliance, ruled by a Parliament with utopian designs for humanity. (Perhaps this is intended as a critical commentary on the moral dualism of Lucas's vision, but it's too referential for my tastes). The rebels in this instance are the Independents, who have been defeated. A former rebel, Captain Mal, reprises the Han Solo role as an outlaw adventurer in his beloved though ramshackle ship. He reluctantly helps the anti-Alliance cause by giving shelter to River and her doctor brother. They loosely parallel Princess Leia and her brother, Luke, while the secret that the Alliance is after is not the plans of the Death Star encoded in R2D2, but the dark secret of a dead planet, embedded in the mind of the psychotic psychic River. In their pursuit comes a nameless sword-wielding philosophical assassin, who is strongly reminiscent to Darth Vader, including forcing Mal's friends to betray him (with a sequence which parallels the Cloud City episode).The movie saved by its strong humour and cerebral approach, particularly to the issues of good and evil. Contrary to much of the press, it is Mal not River who is the central character - obviously people are influenced by the ""Buffy"" comparison. River is almost an afterthought in the second half of the movie - perhaps this is because the story line needed a TV series to explore all its details.",Serenity
671,johnsilver-33608,Not recommended,3,17 August 2016,"If you love higher quality Sci-Fi movies like ""2001 - A space odyssee"" or ""Blade Runner"" you will be disappointed by this movie. The plot is quite weird and the cast really average. You will find no top actor in this movie. Only Summer Glau is powerful to me, despite her odd role. Setting and effects are quite good though. The sound balance of the movie is not really good, you will have to adjust level a few times, cause music and effects are getting way too loud from time to time. This is a bit annoying. However the music score itself is really nice. Nevertheless I am surprised this movie made it up to a score of 8.0, imho it is quite boring and definitely not worth seeing.",Serenity
672,myeck,Even better the second time.,9,2 October 2005,"Wow, what an amazing film. Best SF I've seen in quite a while. Too many SF films are made with the idea that a ton of CGI is all you need. This one is based on good writing, creating characters you care about, and a real respect for the intelligence of the viewers.My wife was devastated by the big plot developments towards the end and I could hear her sniffling all the way to the end of the credits. As we walked back into the sunshine though, she asked when we would see it again!So we ended up seeing again the same day, in a different theatre. I think I liked it even better the second time.",Serenity
673,chrisfewtrell,"God bless Serenity, and all who sail with her.",10,22 August 2006,"I read the reviews, listened to the hype, hadn't seen the TV show so didn't know what the fuss was about. Eventually saw the movie, and... Wow! All you fans who were disappointed - go and take another look, your expectations blinded you. Don't worry, it happens to us all. I can't describe this movie like I would some others, because I'd end up adding to the hype and raising the expectations of my friends to unreachable highs. Let me concentrate on what separates Serenity from just about anything I can think of off the top of my head, certainly in recent memory. First, you just have to love and care about these characters, just as the writer and cast so obviously do. Then you are knocked out by a script that ignores the audience, at the same time as totally respecting it. That is, it assumes a certain level of intelligence and leaves you to get on with it - no patronising, no padding, no post-modern irony, or whatever they call those lame attempts at humour film makers use to try and get the audience on the characters' sides. This movie has charm in spades, the charm Hollywood seems convinced Vince Vaughn possesses but actually represents the opposite of. This movie resurrects your faith in movies, in people with ideas, commitment, talent, love of and belief in what they're doing. It confirms what I've been thinking for a while, as a movie lover who has almost ceased visiting the movies in the past three or four years - most of the real talent is working in American TV. You have to ration yourself nowadays, otherwise you'll drift through life doing nothing but watch high class, endlessly original and entertaining products rolling off the US TV production line, be it the Simpsons, the Sopranos, Rescue Me, or Firefly. TV used to be considered a threat to Hollywood, then its poor relation, then a rest home for ageing actors. Only recently has the output of HBO and the major TV studios regularly outperformed Hollywood in terms of scope, imagination, acting, writing and production values. For every Ocean's Twelve, a West Wing. Joss Whedon has successfully overlapped TV and Hollywood, others will surely follow, and we, the audience, can only be winners. God bless Serenity, and all who sail with her.",Serenity
674,texican1836_45,What can I say without giving a spoiler,9,1 October 2005,"HHHHHMMMMMMMM this was a great movie in my opinion, it has all the excitement and adventure of the TV show plus more. It also has aws, wows, can you believe thats, and some crys and tears. This movie is a dream come true in bring back a TV show that was never given a proper chance to build a audience and show what it could do in a TV line up against other shows properly. The script allows hardcore fans to instantly reconnect with old friends and allows those who have never seen firefly to be drawn into the story right from the beginning and never have the feeling of being lost in the plot line. PLEASE Let There Be A Sequel, or bring BACK the TV Show or Bring Back the Series Even if in Subscription Form",Serenity
675,The_Dman,Joss Whedon does it again! Serenity is Awesome,9,9 October 2005,"When I first heard Joss Whedon was behind this one, I knew it was going to be good, I just didn't realize how good it was going to be. Serenity is set quite some time in the future, many humans have left earth and have colonized another solar system, now led and controlled by ""The Alliance"", the movie is about a crew of outlaws on the ship Serenity, led by their father like leader, Mal (Nathan Fillion). For some time now Serenity had been hiding a doctor and his apparently insane and physic sister, River (Summer Glau), who it turns out is actually a super weapon trained by the alliance, who want her back, very badly.The team is forced to flee from The Alliance and The Operative, the alliance sent to kill them. Unfortuently time after time they are almost caught and only narrowly dodge some of the traps laid by The Operative. They are eventually forced to move to the reaver invested outskirts, to a planet called Miranda, where they find out that the reavers, a group of insane violent cannibals, were in face created, accidentally, by The Alliance. In one final leap, to try and take down the alliance, the serenity crew try to release the big secret and turn the people against the alliance.Throughout the movie we see some really good action scenes, as is to be expected from Buffy creator, Joss Whedon. One of my most favorite fight scenes actually happens behind closed doors and little of the battle is seen, but what is seen is amazing. River battles, alone, hundreds of reavers, slaughtering them mercilessly, with a strange grace and composure.Apart from that their is also a short, but fun, space battle towards the end, when the serenity crew, lead a fleet of, pursuing, reavers up against the alliance fleet.Besides from the action, there is also a fair bit of humor, and just like Buffy, all the main characters are exceptionally witty, so expect some quick comebacks and some smart one-liners.Preformace wise, I think it's fair to say that if anyone can play a crazy chick, it's Summer Glau and anyone who has seen the 4400 will recognize her as ""Tess Doerner"", another insane, yet gifted, character. Nathan Fillion was also a lot of fun, but it was hard to decide whether to account the brilliance of the character, Mal, to either him of Mr. Wheldon, either way, I wasn't disappointed.If you haven't seen Serentiy, see it. I promise you, you won't be disappointed unless, of course, your blind or deaf..or both.",Serenity
676,brandondboucher,"All action, little depth",5,4 October 2005,"Though I am not a fan or geek hailing the TV show, I know what I like to see in a movie. This movie did not satisfy my needs. There is plenty of action to go around, which is entertaining and all, but more is needed to make a movie great. I will agree that this is a great movie...for a young teenager, but what we are missing here is good acting and good writing. Granted, the plot is entertaining yet predictable but the writing of the characters is horrid. So, in closing, see this movie solely for its action to prevent yourself from being disappointed. As for the comparison of Serenity to Star Wars, give me a break. Though the Star Wars movies did not have mature dialogue, they still had good dialogue, dialogue that fit. They also had actual underlying themes unlike this movie. This movie attempts to have themes but the acting and context just do not match. So, again, do not go into the theater expecting more than a good dose of predictable plot and action.",Serenity

WHY OH WHY did they make that LOL) Watch it.",Serenity
678,bdutton,A very original scifi flick. Refresshing. 9 of 10,9,17 October 2005,"I watched the whole series on video the week before I went to see the movie.The movie starts out with a brief introduction of the 'verse'... the history of the universe from the perspective of the 'Alliance'. A Parliament style government who exert control over the outer colonies through force.The outlying colonies, formed from moons and planets in a solar system that were created over decades of Terra-forming. Many of these colonies lack the advanced technology of the central planets in the alliance and therefore live life much like the old west of late 1800's in the US.The central characters: Malcome (Mal) Reynolds: Captain of the Firefly Class ship called Serenity. His character is an anti-hero. A bad guy that shoots first and many times does what is right.Zoe: The (female) second in command and old war buddy.Wash: The pilot of Serenity and husband of Zoe.Inara: The Companion (i.e. Whore) who rents one of the two shuttles on Serenity.Jayne: The mercenary (Played wonderfully by Adam Baldwin of Full Metal Jacket).Kaylee: The cute and talented engineer who manages to keep Serenity flying.Simon: A passenger on Serenity paying his way by acting as ships doctor.River: Simon's sister. She was in an alliance Bio-engineering program to turn her into a psycho-assassin-mind reader. Simon risked his career to break her out of the secret lab where she was kept.Book: A shepherd (i.e. priest) who booked passage on Serenity during the TV series and now lives on one of the colonies.The Operative: The ruthless agent of the Alliance tracking down River.The characters are well played. Wash did not have as much dialog as his character deserved but his lines when delivered were excellent. Of all the characters I would say Jayne is my favorite. His brute force mentality and simple look on life are a nice twist for your hero troupe.Reavers are featured extensively. They are terrifyingly brutal and sadistic inhabitants of the space just beyond the solar system and occasionally prey on lone ships and isolated moons. Just saying their name brings about fear in the eyes of the main characters.The fight scenes between River and just about everybody (Especially the Reavers) are well choreographed.This movie is full of excellent on-liners and snappy dialog.One can expect there to be some invented and unexpected language. gorram = goddam. There is the ample use of Chinese mixed in with dialog to enhance the swearing or to drive home a point. You do not need to understand but rather read the facial expression and body language to get the message. A personal note about the use of Chinese: This is the future earth. American/English and Chinese culture dominate the world today. As the world becomes smaller due to population growth and technology Chinese and English language and culture meld together in this version of the future. It makes a lot of sense when you think about the current state of the world.The cgi effects are adequate but not the selling point of this movie. It is the characters, story and snappy dialog that makes this a gem.Anyway, go see this movie and enjoy it for what it is. An original sci-fi movie with a refreshing blurred lines between the bad guys and the good guys.",Serenity
679,Mandrew-2,What an achievement,10,2 October 2005,"I FINALLY got around to catching Serenity today, and it surpassed all my expectations. It had all the action, drama, smart dialog, effects, and Whedonness that made me love ""Firefly"", but stepped up several notches. Finally, we have some closure to the first season.The only missing element was the strong character development that Whedon built so perfectly in the 14 episodes on disc. One can only hope he has the chance to continue his rich and textured universe with the success of Serenity.I'm gonna go see it tomorrow as well, not only because it was incredible, but because it will stand as a vote to movie executives everywhere, saying ""I don't want another season of Laguna Beach, I want another season of Firefly"". Or however they interpret it. Either way, please, not another Laguna Beach, the national IQ has already dropped sharply.Whedon once again displays his propensity to quickly and unexpectedly kill off main characters without remorse, as happens in life. This is why I love the movie so, you truly feel like each character's days are numbered, and in the final half hour, like Joss just might kill off the entire cast for some sick reason.Rarely does a series make you love the cast and ""idea"" behind it, Star Trek TNG comes to mind, but Firefly and the continuance of Serenity do just that...what great concepts, great characters, and great film-making.",Serenity
680,mad_happy,If only the last 3 Star Wars films could have been this good!,10,15 October 2005,"Having watched firefly I couldn't wait to see this movie, although was worried about how it could really work on the big screen. Wow, from start to finish I was sat on the edge of my seat, it was everything a sci-fi movie should be and more, it was also full of some great one liners. The acting was out of this world, no wooden actors to be seen here. I took my wife to see this movie, she'd never seen Firefly and is not a fan of sci-fi movies but to my surprise she loved it, so it really does not matter if you've seen, or not seen Firefly. I really can't recommend this movie enough, star wars really starts to look poor when you see this how brilliant this film is.",Serenity
681,self_indulgent,Best t.v. series in a long while and a Goram fine film !,10,20 November 2007,"It never fails to surprise me how little studio execs. learn from experience. Star trek suffered the same sort of fate.. Firefly being canceled after so few episodes was yet another blisteringly short sited move.This was an excellent series and an outstanding film well written by thorough professionals and populated by a small collection of both memorable and endearing characters. This cannot be said of a great many films. I firmly believe that the series should be resurrected and that if the studios are as they would have us believe they are , the film could be made into a franchise which could rival star wars.... but that's only my opinion.",Serenity
682,davidmfowler,best TV science fiction ever,10,4 October 2005,"This is the single best science fiction that has ever been on TV. period.The world is real, these are my friends and I would gladly serve and die with them.Four days ago I didn't know that I didn't know a Gorram thing. Now the 'verse is a ""ruttin"" shiny place for me.My Firefly friends wanted to see the movie this weekend, so this past weekend I ""netflixed"" the first disc, the next day I bought the whole DVD and last night I went to see the movie before even my friends.I disagree with the folks who think you should see this movie without seeing the DVD of TV first. I think if you didn't already love the crew of this boat that seeing the movie would not be as good an experience for you. The reason this movie totally rocks is that I do love this crew and I care like mad. I laugh, I cry, and I love them.If you don't know Mal's history before you get to the theater, he may seem like just a stupid hard ass. If however you have spent 14 previous hours with him and know his life story, you know that you would make every single little move he makes.When my friend told me one reviewer said of Mal, ""Han Solo wishes he were this cool"" my thought was yeah right. Now that review is such and understatement that it is not even funny. I am a huge Heinlein fan and I have high hopes for ""Moon"" soon, having said that, I would put the entire world of Firefly up there. We love Heinlein because of his characters, his ideas about justice and his worlds. Tell me Firefly does not have all of that in spades. Moon and the book version of Troopers may still be my favorites but I tell you, I love Firefly.Besides Harrison's best sci-fi effort is hardly Han Solo.See you in the world, I hit ""atmo"" in five, four...",Serenity
683,lemuria-2,Serenity Review,10,2 June 2014,"The film opens with a bank robbery, and if you've never seen an episode of the cancelled television show ""Firefly"" from which Serenity was spawned, you're already in trouble. There's some attempt here to start the movie cleanly, without the need for prior knowledge, but it's impossible with so many characters being introduced and promptly not introduced. In a way, it's a good thing. Having the television show as a base frees Serenity from having to bother with a boring origin story. At the same time, if you haven't seen any of ""Firefly"" it's a lot like watching Empire Strikes Back without having seen A New Hope. It might occasionally leave you a little lost, but ""Firefly"" fan or not, this is still a great movie.",Serenity

Come on you have go to be kidding!,1,3 April 2007,"After reading on the BBC that this was voted the best sci-fi movie of all time, I thought fair enough, I'll check it out. I am extremely disappointed. Lousy incomprehensible story line, lousy cheesy script, lousy acting, lousy effects..the lousy list just goes on and on! Most of the scenes from the movies have been stolen from other films, star wars, resident evil, blade runner, aliens etc..but unfortunately, that's just simply not enough to make a good movie. I can't believe people rated this garbage over 2001, alien, blade runner & star wars according to the BBC article. I also can't believe this has such a high rating on this site. IMDb used to be fairly reliable as a review source for movies, I can only guess that every 12 year old with a computer has now taken residence on this site and has destroyed any credibility it once had.",Serenity
686,koshman-1,Masterpiece!,10,22 July 2010,"This must be one of the best movies I've ever seen. I only saw Firefly last week for the first time but like it a lot. I was sad that only 14 episodes have ever been made, so the movie for me was a chance for the series to last a bit longer. I didn't expect much more from it, didn't even expect it to be as good as the series considering the different format. But it is. Yes, it is. I think this is as close as Firefly can ever get to a true space opera. The setting is still the same - it't still the dirty dozen (9 or 10 actually...) in a space that's not a very nice place to live, but they're on a mission now and they act as true heroes. The movie answers a lot of the questions left over from the series, it uncovers some more history of the conflict between Alliance and the browncoats in a very natural way. It's much more emotional - of course, it's a true swansong to Firefly so characters are allowed to die. Most importantly - when the final credits roll, you feel something - this isn't the kind of movie that vanishes from your brain the second it ends. I really think that the last 40 or so minutes are as close to perfection as you can get in this genre. The scene when River is shown slaughtering the Reavers with her graceful moves, the music and everything at that moment, that was the highlight for me - ah, we can still win it was my thought at the moment:-) When you have a great time every single second of a movie + the ending is awesome and leaves a lasting impression you know you've just been treated to something special. Watch it, then watch it again. A must see.",Serenity
687,kysersoze-1,A good beginning.,9,1 October 2010,If you are fan of movies like star wars then you will definitely definitely like Serenity. It has powerful script. All characters are very well presented in the movie.Performances of two main characters Nathan Fillion as somewhat confused spaceship commander and Chiwetel Ejiofor as smooth talking assassin were good but rest were OK and not that special.The only downfall of the movie is that it has no star actor and it is neither from some famous director. For a movie to be financially hit across the world it would need some face or some name to represent it for publicity. And this movie lacked exactly that. In fact myself never heard of it till I searched movies on IMDb with rating as sorting criteria. Unfortunately as movie did bad financially we may not have any sequel to this.This movie is absolutely worth watching in my opinion 9/10.,Serenity
688,mathmangum,Even better when you take the time to think about it.,10,12 May 2007,"Serenity on the surface is the exciting adventures of the starship Captain Mal Reynolds and his crew; it is also conclusion of the television series Firefly. But looking past the action and great special effects this film like most science fiction contains numerous commentaries on our society today. At the heart of this film is the question, what do you believe, and how far are you willing to go for that belief? The story takes place in a distant solar system hundreds of years in the future. The crew of the Firefly class starship Serenity have become outlaws after being on the losing end of a war against the galactic government known as the Alliance. They had fought for independence, the right to for each planet to govern themselves and not to be governed by a distant regime. The alliance was better manned and better equipped than the rebels fighting for their independence and these rebels commonly known as Browncoats soon lost at the bloody battle of Serenity Valley. Captain Mal Reynolds was one of the few survivors. With time he found himself operating a transport ship with a crew of like minded individuals. Some of their jobs were honest, many were not. But like Robin Hood the crew of the Serenity only committed illegal acts against the government that they despised. Although they would never admit it they were continuing to fight a war long done, simply because of their belief that the Alliance was an evil empire.One of the major reasons that the crew of the Serenity continues to annoy the Alliance is that they do not agree with the Alliance's philosophy that they can force a man to think and behave in what they deem as acceptable ways. River Tam, a young woman aboard the Serenity is an example of this. She was rescued by her brother after the Alliance military performed numerous experiments on her brain, conditioning her to become an assassin at the Alliance's beck and call and stripping River of her personal freedom. Another example of the Alliance's attempt to control the minds of the people they governed happened on the planet Miranda. The introduction of a chemical into the air killed millions and turned millions of others into monsters. The knowledge of this act finally forces Mal to realize that he does have a belief system and that he truly does not just go with whichever way the wind is blowing.This belief of course puts Mal at odds with the government operatives who have the opposite belief. That mankind must be controlled to make the world a better place. Everyone is willing to die for their beliefs, but as Mal puts it, ""That's not exactly plan A."" So while of course our hero, flawed as he may be, succeeds in his goals the message of the film is not that he is right and others are wrong, but simply, it does not matter what you believe in, just that you believe in something. Having a belief in something larger than yourself is what will guide you in your life and point you on the right path for you.",Serenity
689,spottay212,"LOVED this movie, could contain spoilers",10,8 January 2006,"I didn't watch the series on FOX (regrettably) and unfortunately FOX canceled it before I got the chance. But I do remember watching some previews for Firefly and I didn't know that this was where Serenity came from. I found out that Serenity had the same cast (always cool) as the television series and that it was a pretty good movie. So I went to go see it...AND IT WAS one of THE BEST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN!! There are so many little parts that one could appreciate in this movie. There's excellent fighting scenes, with a kicka$$ River! And Malcolm too, I suppose he was a good fighter, too. Not to mention I think he's handsome...*dreamy look* This movie is also pretty fun for being a Sci-fi as well. What?! A Sci-fi?! Oh right. I talked to one of my teachers (physics) and I asked if he liked it and he said yes, especially how they didn't explain how things worked, like the flying aircraft stuff. Well, not that they didn't explain it, but that they didn't try to explain it and get it wrong (and he referred to Star Wars...I don't know, haven't seen them).One of the best things in this movie, in my opinion, are the cute names that Malcolm calls River, he likes her ^_^",Serenity
690,jrome-barathieu,Money killed the Firefly,6,26 March 2011,"I wanted to read all your commentaries before hand but finally decided to directly jump to mine. I discovered the series quite recently and bought the series and the film. I have no regrets as to the purchase of the show which I find to be thrilling and truly interesting. As much as Serenity is concerned I am having second thoughts.The true problem of the film was to make something that would sell and if the series was finally cancelled because believed to be not worth the cost, the producers wanted to gain some money out of the film and because of that they pretty much killed all that was interesting in the show. The humor is for the most part gone, the interactions between the characters are at best simplistic and most of the money was spent on the visual effects. It shines and it is really pretty but it does not look like Firefly. I do not remember seeing massive fights every ten seconds and the exploration of a planet and the interactions with its inhabitants is gone. The western spirit of the show is for the most part gone too.Some could argue that it is giving closure in relation to plots of the show but to see how it is done is just disappointing. The men in blue are gone and have been replaced by alliance guys who have a terrible secret that River has discovered reading someone's mind and it explains the Reavers. It is far too easy and not even evoked in the show itself as the men in blue seemed to be willing to create super humans for a reason or another and cherry of the icing of cake being the afore mentioned River who has become a cold blood killer and a super fighter (I still have trouble thinking that she is only seventeen).Last but not least, the need to kill several characters is a shame and those remaining don't have a very important part (take Jayne or Inara).The series was really amazing and deserved at the very least another season but the film is giving a grim end to the story (if it is to be the end).",Serenity

This one ain't.This is one of the best sci-fi movies I have seen in quite a while. It has great characters (actors that can actually act,) great surprises, great action and a story that doesn't make you go- Huh!?!? I highly recommend going to see this movie, even if you are not familiar with the show Firefly. It helps a little to know about the character back story from the series but it is not necessary.Go watch the movie... then you'll probably want to pick up the DVD series of Firefly. I did and I don't regret it a bit!",Serenity
692,Summerfield,Just absolutely wonderful,9,21 November 2005,"I am a fan, it is to say, of the Firefly series. So much so that I was somewhat fearful of what they might do to the concept, the verse and the characters. But I was very very pleasantly surprised by this movie. It is witty and true to the series. Though some things have changed they are easily overlooked. The dialog is great, the humor dry and the story really unfolds before your eyes. It doesn't matter if you don't know the series because all the characters are reintroduced but it's done in such a way that if you do know the series it doesn't matter. You just know slightly more about them than the rest of the audience. It's like the audience is at a party some of the guests (the characters in the film) you know and know well and others a new and interesting. It's a very good mix. It has been a long time since I came out of a cinema think ""well that was absolutely wonderful."" and plan to go again in the next couple of days, and buy the DVD for sure. If you don't see this movie you are missing something good.",Serenity
693,nefretu,"Brilliant, a must see",10,7 October 2005,"I really do not have to say much, expect that you simply have to go and see this movie. It does not matter if you have seen the TV show or not, you will enjoy the movie. It is impossible not to. It was funny when least expected, sad, it had incredible special effects and action and of course, a good, decent story telling. If you have seen the show, you will be rewarded for getting another glimpse at your favorite characters, but if you have not seen it, there is no need. The movie can be followed without being familiar with the story before. JUST GO AND SEE IT AND TELL EVERYONE ABOUT IT. And now to some spoilers, so please do not read on if you do not want to know before you go and see the movie. I was a bit sad that the theme music from the show was not really featured but that was about the only thing that I have a negative comment about. Mal was great, you got to see a darker side of him and some emotional conflict about the decision he simply had to make. Simon and Kaylee finally got to hook up and I especially enjoyed the scene where he told her that the only thing he regretted was not hooking up with her. She turned around and asked him out right, if he meant sex and he said yes. Then she got up and started firing at the Reevers, saying something like, 'We are going to get out of this, so we can do it.' It was funny. I also loved the ending when a piece of equipment fell of the ship, just like the whole movie started. It was the last funny punchline. Really great. We also get to see some emotions between Mal and Eanara (not quite sure how her name is written), so all hope is not lost there. So to sum it up, go and see the movie. What are you waiting for?",Serenity
694,name_not,A big budget series finale,6,15 January 2014,"I am giving it a 6, a relatively low rating cause of the following:As a stand alone movie, it deserves a 4. Reasons: Viewers not familiar with the characters will not become more familiar with them through this movie. They wont know Mal holds a massive grudge against the Alliance, they wont know the pilot is the crew comedian, they wont know who the hell is the Priest or the Companion and how much they mean to Mal and the crew, and they will wonder what the hell is going on between Kaylee and Simon. IMO it is all very poorly presented to new viewers.As a closure of Firefly series, it deserves about 8. I enjoyed it as a Firefly fan: great opening scenes, a very good plot, and I am satisfied with the end. Maybe a mistake to kill the pilot so suddenly and pointlessly like its a Tarantino movie, it did not produce any particular effect whatsoever except to make us sadder. He might as well lived, it wouldn't make the movie worse.So I am just averaging it and it turns out 6. I know many people will not agree with me, I find it a little low as well, but 7 puts it in a way better class of movies. And it already has a way higher rating then it should have.",Serenity

God-awful dialog, special effects that look like they're from Half-Life 1, a plot that sags in the middle like a hammock, and... a Western... set in SPACE. How much of a fan boy do you have to be to eat this tripe and give it a 10 star rating? I can stand a spot or two of bad dialog, but the constant placing of punchlines was way too much. It's like they were written by a sugar-high sixth grader and a group of his friends. ""Oh God, oh God we're all gonna die?"" ""In all that time on the ship...

697,bpboyt,Brilliant and Refreshing Future Vision,10,4 August 2006,The director of this film holds an incredible vision and capacity to bring a very well wrought thought to film on a low budget.The special effects are very solid and do not betray the lack of financial backing this movie actually had.Joss Whedon is a director on the rise and if his vision is as great as in the future he may well be another Lucas.The actors were not perhaps the best known however displayed the ability to make us want to know their characters more in depth.

698,jonathan-byfield,Contains all that the last three Star Wars Movies lacked.,9,7 October 2005,"I will admit now I have (so far) not seen the series, although after seeing the movie, this will change. Also I admit that when a friend told me before going to see it that it was on the verge of getting into the top 100 I was sceptical. I now see why it has such a high rating. It contains all that the last three Star Wars movies lacked, it had wit, humour, those great one liners you learn to expect from the guy who created Buffy, it had a good story plot (OK I'm not saying that SW totally lacked these but that Serenity had about ten times as much). This was a fun movie with great characters, I did worry that I wouldn't be able to pick it up, not having watched the series but that wasn't a problem, it was written so you could get right into. All in all this was a really fun movie that I enjoyed immensely. Incidentally I gave it a nine out of ten, why? As far as I am concerned only certain serious movies such as Ghandi, Schindler's List, the Shawshank Redemption etc... get such a rating, so I gave it as high as a mark as I could.",Serenity

Now I don't usually follow the recommendation of video rental staff, but by this time we had already spent almost an hour looking for something. I had heard about the short lived TV series ""Firefly"" but never seen it. I asked the girl behind the counter ""do I need to know the series, characters etc to be able to understand this movie?"" She replied ""No, not at all"". OK so we got it out (I had a 1 free hire coupon on me thank god). I'm sorry all you Firefly fans but this movie is utterly tiresome. Aside from the Special FX (which were impressive) I was ready to kill myself within the fist 1/2 hour. The dialogue was dribble and the characters were unconvincing. Joss has done better. That is all.",Serenity
700,SunburstGal,Female Sci-Fi Fan's Review with Minor Spoilers,8,9 April 2010,"I was both impressed and disappointed with this film (8 out of 10). As a huge Star Wars fan, a follower of other sci-fi franchises (including a little Star Trek), and an avid reader of sci-fi (especially the Dune and Foundation novels), I consider myself rather spoiled when it comes to sci-fi content. I did not see the ""Firefly"" series when it was on TV, but I DID watch it before watching this film and LOVED the series (10 out of 10 rating). To add context, 4 or 5 years have now passed since this film was made and approx. 7 years since the series. Today in 2010, I'm a big fan of Nathan Fillion on his current show, ""Castle,"" and also know Morena Baccarin and Alan Tudyk from ""V."" As a woman watching the series, it was hard not to fall for Fillion's character, Captain Malcom ""Mal"" Reynolds, and the other characters from the show were likable and appealing. I loved seeing a continuation of the story on a grander scale and thought the plot was well conceived. As much as I hate seeing some characters killed off (I won't say whom), such was a brave and realistic approach taken by creator Whedon when he made this film, and I approve. I was hugely disappointed, however, that nothing significant played out between Mal and Inara in the film. Their verbal sparring and sexual tension in the series was as entertaining as Han Solo and Princess Leia, and Inara's decision to leave the ship was a large part of the unresolved cliff-hanger – will he go after her? will they get onto themselves and become a couple? So, again, as a woman, I was really hoping for more elements of an Empire Strikes Back-esquire culmination of two stubborn, independent people admitting they're in love. Mal Reynolds starts out the film more edgy and less charming than one remembers him from the series, and, if it's from disappointment over his lost love, it's a wonder that he softens up in the film, given the small amount of screen time given to Inara. It was reminiscent of the infamous X-Files movie a dozen years ago when people were disappointed there wasn't even a kiss between the romantic leads. Additionally, Baccarin's character, Inara, is so captivating, compared to her harsh alien leader character in ""V,"" that I was looking forward to seeing a lot more of her in this softer role - alas, no. I will have to replay endearing and romantic ""almost"" moments from the episodes. While things moved only a little bit in the right direction with Mal and Inara, more time was spent furthering the Simon/Kaylee romance, which was still also somewhat underdone (although I swear it was always a little bit of a hard sell because the actor seems gay to me). There was too little romance, although the right amount of effects and action and a good story. To Whedon's credit, there was also no nudity or extreme violence, no off-on-a-tangent new characters who took away unnecessarily from the ones we love, and no ill-advised interjection of aliens, the supernatural, time travel, black holes, or other surreal elements that would not have been true to the series. Plus, we finally get to see reavers. As for characters, there was way too much River, a little too much Simon, the right amount of Reynolds/Kaylee/Shepherd/new villain, a little too little Jayne/Zoe/Wash, and way too little Inara. Did Whedon date-and-break-up-with one actress and start dating the other? Yet, I understand the River Tam character had a big fan following, so it made sense to feature her more (just not quite so much). It fit well with the plot-line selected, and gave actress Glau a good audition reel for her Sarah Connor Chronicles role (now also a cancelled show). I also sense that Whedon was hoping in 2005 to make more than one continuation film. It's hard to fit everything into 2 hours, but I wish I had been left with more of a Death-Star-was-destroyed-and-everyone-is-in-love sense of closure like I had after Return of the Jedi. Another 15 minutes of screen time might have done it. Instead, frustrated people with unfulfilled romances must shake off the loss of loved ones and move on to continue fighting in an unfair world. So, in summary, if you haven't seen the series, I would recommend you watch the series first. But if you don't have the time to watch the series, you will like this movie anyway and probably won't notice the imbalances and omissions that I saw. If you love the series, you'll be thrilled to see the characters again (with original cast) and the better effects, but there isn't enough closure and realization in the film to cheer you up about reaching what (many years later) must truly be the end of this wonderful adventure.",Serenity
701,llarusso,Run to see Serenity,10,1 October 2005,"I absolutely loved this movie! If you liked Star Wars, run, do not walk to see Serenity! These ""rebels"" would be right at home in the company of Hans Solo and the Milennium Falcon. Just when you think you know what's going to happen next - you would be wrong. Plus it has exciting space-chase scenes, humor and sadness with a wonderfully endearing cast of misfits led by Nathan Fillion and Gina Torres. Joss Whedon is not afraid to take chances with his plot or his characters and has done a splendid job creating a fast paced action adventure roller-coaster ride. It even has a message. The audience applauded when it ended. And if you like the TV show ""Numbers"" catch David Krumholz in a featured role. I can't wait for a sequel. (By the way, you don't have to be familiar with the TV series to know what's going on.) Don't miss Serenity! I'm going to see it again!",Serenity
702,paul_loader,Flippin amazing,10,26 October 2005,"At last a film that does exactly what it says on the tin!!! I always enjoyed Firefly the TV series, however Serenity was much MUCH better.A fantastic cast, a comic book villain who wasn't a caricature (although typically he was British - what is with the Americans making us Brits the bad guy, or girl every chance that they get. Or is that you need a really good actor or actress to play the evil role and ....well.....nuff said). The story bounced along nicely, not a single moment of boredom. Car chases (well, flying car chases), fist fights, kung Fu, shoot em up's, a teeny bit of romance, cannibalistic lunatics, and wise arsed comments from beginning to end...I mean, what else could you ask for.I left Episode 3 feeling disappointed and slightly depressed.

703,Paul-sen,Watch the series first,6,6 January 2008,"Firefly is easily one of the best TV series in the SF genre. If the IMDb ratings can be trusted, also the female viewers seem to agree with this assessment (maybe only after they've been talked into watching it). The series provides a solid background for the movie you shouldn't miss. While striving to be self-contained, without this background the characters remain flat and unlikable, and their relationships dull and stereotyped.Also, the plot has its weak points. The Mr. Universe character is created out of some cliché, and the Miranda secret is so simplistic that you begin asking yourself if this is from one of the more ill-reputed star trek episodes, when you promised yourself you wouldn't ever watch it again.All this probably sounds worse than it is. While the movie falls short, you'll find that a lot of the things that made the series exceptional are still there. The movie is well made, and the dialog is fun to listen to.Once more, even though I am repeating myself here: watch Firefly first. You will enjoy the movie far more than otherwise.",Serenity
704,terencevasa,let down,1,18 October 2005,OK i went to see this film after all the user comments said it was a great film with brilliant special effects i think i must have seen the wrong film cause the one i see had poor sound effects to the extent where i could not understand what was being said for the first 20 minutes. There was a battle seen which i thought was very poor showing mostly close up views of things blowing up which looked to me like something out of a b movie. The woman who played river was so annoying and the part was so weak i did not see the point of having her in the film at all. yet another film that as been highly rated yet failed to live up to much. an easily forgettable film and i would not recommend this film to anyone.sorry about the spelling by the way.,Serenity

The writing is top notch, as one would expect from Joss Whedon, and he bravely injects some daring plot developments into the movie. Sure the FX aren't up there with the $100 million films, but what do you expect for $40 million? The good thing is - it doesn't matter. Because ""Serenity"" is all about story, and characters that you care about, which is worth more than a hundred summer tent-pole flicks put together. See it!",Serenity
707,david-laurence,Flawless Masterpiece,10,10 October 2005,"I am completely speechless after watching this film. What Joss Whedon has created here is a work of pure genius. The characters are incredibly well developed, the action is non-stop, and the dialogue is fantastic. And I haven't even touched on the fabulous ""villain"" in the Operative; some amazing depth there as well.This movie gets it right on every level. It has humor, laughs, and even some intense and creepy scenes involving the cannibalistic reavers. If you haven't seen this movie, SEE IT! And if you've already seen it well see it again! Do anything you can to support this movie, because we can only hope and pray that this is not the last venture into films for Mr. Whedon, or Serenity for that matter.The perfect movie.",Serenity
708,anandmaraekaurbaar,Good but missing the key ingredient.,7,30 August 2016,"Serenity manages to improve upon all the flashy aspects of firefly, the action is larger, grander, better played out and the improved visuals help out the sci-fi elements of the series. Although it lacks the originals character development and interaction, it is a joy to see the family back together again for a last adventure. What made the show great was the back and forth interactions of the crew and the varied reactions they had to different situations befalling them. Their diverse backgrounds and ideals played of each other well and seeing their views challenged and changed was a joy to watch. That requires time, which is not the luxury a future film can have, cementing my belief that the firefly universe was perfectly utilized as a TV Show. All in all definitely enjoyable for a Browncoat, but it also makes me miss the TV show that much more.",Serenity
709,jpg97,"Very well-made sci-fi flick, and worthy closure of the series",10,24 November 2006,"I first saw this movie about a year ago. I wasn't expecting anything, because the Firefly series wasn't even on TV here in the Netherlands.The first few scenes blew me away! And after that i loved every minute of the movie, but it left me with questions, until I ""discovered"" that this movie was part of a TV-show ""Firefly"".Lots of humour and drama, as well as suspense and plots. I watched the series and then watched the movie again. I love the ""Firefly"" universe and I am sad that there aren't more episodes.But the movie is superb and I am hoping for a new installment of the Firefly saga, knowing that it won't happen.",Serenity
710,zen39699,The best sci-fi film comes from Joss Whedon and why would you expect any less?,10,7 October 2005,"**Minor Spoilers!**This is without a doubt one of the most exciting, thrilling, painfully sad and amusing films I have ever seen. Let me start with the director, Joss Whedon.Joss Whedon has the knack for writing great characters, that even in the heat of battle, have the ability for a quick one liner without it being seemingly implausible or silly. The man is a genius when it comes to dialogue and this film can now prove that statement to the mainstream cinema goer and Whedon haters alike, whom gave the man little or no chance in the past. Joss can create all the above mentioned emotions with just one scene and he does it with style! GENIUS. As for the characters and the film&;Firstly, let me say that the acting is top notch is this film, Joss has the ability to cast well and get the best from his cast. They all bond and act off each other well and the timing of the one-liners is handled excellently by both cast and director. Nathan Fillion (Captain Malcolm Reynolds) is the star here; forget what the trailers tell you, he is WITHOUT a doubt the main star, no questions asked. Yes, Summer Glau (River) is also a star, but she is placed squarely behind Mal in the line-up and for good reason... Nathan Fillion is going to be a GREAT leading man and I think he can pull off any action film in the world (next Indie anyone?). The rest of the cast is funny and get their fair share of one-liners, whilst River gets to kick some major butt ala Buffy style. Think Buffy on drugs.The story is well developed and has so many meanings to deconstruct and unfold (it kind of mirrors today's politics) and it twists into so many sub-genres it's almost unheard of in any other film. For example, the way the film goes from Sci-fi to love story to family story to horror film is just amazing and I can't believe (well I can... its Joss after all) it was pulled off SOOOO well. Everything fits... nothing is left out and nothing is just filler (like SW EPII). For example, when Mal needs to get to the satellite broadcast equipment, he finds that its in an empty whole of a massive room with no way of getting to it. The audience then thinks ""silly sci-fi nonsense why would that happen"", but Mal replies in a sarcastic kind of worrying way ""hard to get too!"" Brilliant!OK - Stop reading now if you don't want to be SPOILED!!As for the death of two main series characters&; well they were upsetting, but Whedon is telling this story and not one person in the ""verse"" can make him decide otherwise. So in conclusion, great narrative, great character acting/development, great dialogue, great story and GREAT FILM! Go watch... I've already booked my second ticket!Some main highlights: - River and Simon - Mal - REAVERS! - Reavers & The Alliance against Serenity!",Serenity
711,BethelAbba,An incredible ride tying up all loose ends,10,11 December 2005,"I'm not a fan of Joss's other shows, so my attraction to Firefly was based purely upon curiosity. Once I hooked into it (Via the DVD set) I managed to turn many of my friends onto the wry humor, daring adventure & compelling story lines of the show.The movie does a fine job of collecting all the loose threads that remained unanswered, & tying them into a nice neat bow. Like the show, the movie doesn't pull punches. 2 characters I've grown to love die. That is reality, it is life. People die, sometimes valiantly, sometimes sadly. Joss's creative genius gives us something to cherish... people we can relate to. Whereas the Star Trek universe is full of shiny trinkets & sanitized landscapes... Serenity gives us the nuts & bolts of living... & makes no apologies for it in the end.I fell in love with the series, it remains dear to my heart. Serenity, as a movie, only served to make me love it all over again. Thanks, Joss, for an incredible ride through your universe, & the people I've grown to love because of it. I only wish the trip were longer....",Serenity
712,if-i-could-stay,Well this settles it: Joss Whedon is Brilliant,10,4 October 2005,"In 2002, creative genius Joss Whedon launched ""Firefly,"" a sci-fi western about rebel smugglers trying to elude the Alliance's radar. The subtle show filled with reproductions of his Buffy characters (example: Jayne is Spike and Kaylee is Willow), was far too intelligent for normal programming audiences: FOX canceled it after nine episodes. Thankfully, the DVD sales did well enough for Universal to take notice and gave Joss Whedon a film deal.This background history actually provides the most problematic aspect of the film: the illusion of inaccessibility. I say illusion, because there is no denying that your viewing pleasure increases if you understand the nuances of the characters, but you can watch and enjoy the film without them. I dragged two friends with me who never even heard of 'Firefly'. Both followed the plot with ease and loved the film every minute of it.'Serenity' opens with The Operative, a brilliant government assassin, tracking down the disappearance of River Tam, a prodigy with psychic abilities. Her brother, Simon, rescued her months before from government facilities; then took harbor with, Mal, the captain of those rebel smugglers, and his crew on their ship Serenity. The film follows the crew as they discover River's secrets and try to survive Alliance prosecution  and that is only the first act. To divulge the solemn and dark twists of the second act and the 'Angelic' climax would be unfair. Be prepared, some parts are difficult to watch (the three grown men behind me wept), even with the classic Whedon banter undercutting the drama. He also stays true to from by pulling a Miss Calendar.Some critics in the upcoming month or years will compare 'Serenity' to 'Star Wars'. At times, I felt The Force (after all, it is just a good old fashion space opera). However, Serenity could never be Star Wars: it is far too complex, intelligent, and compelling. While Star Wars consisted of cumbersome dialogue, woolly acting, and flat archetypes mistaken for characters drenched in sentimentalism; Serenity soars with witty and dry dialogue, spectacular acting (watch Gina Torres in the final act, she is divine), and complex characters that break their stereotypes. The characters completely drive the plot; nothing happens for show, nothing happens without reason. Furthermore, Joss Whedon hints at themes ranging from: the power of a secret, science verse nature, government control, free press and power of internet, God, Belief, fundamentalists and the nature of history (if only briefly due to the two hour run time). Camp Lucas should take notes.Fans of Joss Whedon will rejoice: his directing has never been better. The sets and CGI are amazing, along with the fluid and beautiful cinematography. There is one shot of River at the end that confirms his Wonder Woman will be godly.Even if you are not huge fan of Joss Whedon's canon, go and enjoy. Every frame is thrilling and entertaining. This is the epitome of great film-making.",Serenity
713,Punjana,A Real Sci-fi Gem,10,12 July 2015,"I have never seen an episode of firefly, but I love this movie. You don't need to see the series to 'get' this movie.The first time you meet Mal on the Serenity and watch the ""one take, no cuts"" scene as he walks around the ship talking to other crew members, moving room to room, going down and upstairs, you know its going to try to be a good movie... and boy oh boy, it is a damn good movie.Very few films these day give you characters you actually care about, and I did find myself instantly liking everyone, that's rare! IMHO the characters are all fully formed and well rounded, there is a genuine feeling of warmth between the actors, who play the roles like they are wearing a comfortable pair of old shoes. (likely due to the time in the T.V series I've yet to watch)Even before I knew him from '12 years a slave' I thought Chiwetel Ejiofor was excellent in this movie.The humour is great also, sometimes so subtle you don't notice it until the second or fifth time you watch it, and you will watch it again.I was also impressed with the special effects. Now I could be wrong but it looked like a lot of stuff was detailed model work with subtle CGI enhancements rather than just the full-blown CGI, it just looked to real sometimes for it to be fake.... (if you know what I mean) but however it was done it gave the movie a little more depth and didn't break your immersion in the STORY.Overall, excellent story and told well, great from the first minute to the last.",Serenity
714,godzuky42,Can't stop the signal,10,15 March 2007,"I'm not sure why it took me so long to review this film. I saw it on the first day it came out, September 30th, and was completely blown away. I very rarely give a movie perfect marks in any kind of review, but this one deserves it.For those who didn't know, Serenity is a continuation of the brilliant TV series Firefly, created by Joss Whedon, who's responsible for Buffy the Vampire Slayer (both movie and series). Now, I'll admit that I'm a huge fan of his, and was one of a select number of people who enjoyed the Buffy movie. But were I to review it, I would give it something like a 2.8/5, I admit it's not actually a good movie, even if I do find it somewhat entertaining.The Buffy series was much better, but even it wasn't anywhere near as amazing as Firefly. Firefly was just plain brilliant, and instantly became my favorite TV series after I got the DVDs for my birthday and watched all the episodes.Firefly was canceled before the story was finished, and Serenity is here to end this story. If summed up quickly, the story sounds typical, a government trying to control everything which turns out to have a big secret. But when you look further into this plot, it gets a little more complex and a lot more intriguing.Serenity takes place approximately 500 years in the future, when humans have colonized other planets after the Earth's resources were used up. The Alliance is the major government, it was established when China and the United States, (the two superpowers of the world at this time), joined forces.This is all covered within the first few minutes of the movie, along with a few other things I don't feel like getting into right now.Then we find out what the situation is. The Alliance is secretly running a so called 'Academy' in which they trick people into enrolling in what sounds like an ordinary university program in order for them to be able to play with their brains. Though what their goal specifically was is never covered, we do know that they managed to turn somebody into a psychic with amazing martial arts skills. One of the students enrolled in the program goes by the name of River Tam (Summer Glau), coming from a rich family and a genius even at a very early age, she signed on to the program excitedly. Her brother, Simon Tam (Sean Maher), breaks her out when he realizes what's going on.What he doesn't realize, is how incredibly important she is to the government.Why? She knows something. She was in the room with some top members of government, who knew something they didn't want the rest of the world to know, apparently.I could go on, because I haven't even gotten into many of the main characters yet, but I don't want ruin the movie for anybody reading this.Those familiar with Whedon's work will probably be aware that he's great with dialogue. He's created MANY witty lines which still make me laugh after hearing them a hundred times.The characters in Firefly (and also Serenity) are really great. You care about them, you care about what happens to them, you care about who dies and you care about who ends up with who.As a huge Firefly fan, I was waiting impatiently for the movie for a while. My expectations were incredibly high. I don't think I've ever had expectations that high for a movie before, and that's probably a good thing since it's just a good way to set yourself up for disappointment, but in this case, I was blown away. My expectations were met, and then some. Serenity is now my favorite movie of all time.That being said, I'm sure people reading this will want to know what a non-fan would think of this movie. Well, the film does a good job of introducing the whole complex world and defining every single character so as not to confuse those unfamiliar with Firefly.But this movie is very compact. It crams a lot into just under two hours. So if you are a non-fan, and you see this movie when you're sleepy or aren't really paying attention, you'll probably have no idea what the hell is going on.I'm sure some of you reacted to the amount of genres listed at the top of this review, but every last one of them is there, and it does well in each category. There is a lot of neat action sequences, if you like that sort of thing, and there are romances going on between very lovable characters if you like that sort of thing. There are times when you'll be creeped out, there are times when you'll be disturbed, there are times when you'll be sad, there are times when you'll be amazed, and there are times when you'll be laughing uncontrollably.",Serenity
715,ranwulf,Lots of fun,9,4 October 2005,"I really liked this one. Joss Whedon's style was all over it - especially the dialogue. The same kind of off the cuff glibness Buffy and friends were always spouting is in evidence here as well - and it's great! I've never seen the series Firefly, but if it's on DVD I'll have to go get it. Morena Baccarin as Inara is the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life, and I hope she gets bigger roles in the future. My only complaint is that the almost rural dialect most of the major characters affected seemed out of place and a little strained. Perhaps that's explained in the series, but if there's an explanation in the movie, I missed it. Overall - a really great sci-fi story that proves everything doesn't have to be about Star Wars.",Serenity
716,cmmahon-1,Postmodern SF Classic,9,9 October 2005,"I will give my considered take on what Serenity represents .There are certain SF movies that form IMHO a canon. These movies are movies, which CHANGE for good, or for ill how we view movies. Believe it or not, Serenity is part of that Canon. Quite simply if you can decipher the text, Serenity is a Postmodernist SF masterpiece. So, if you are like many people in the SF world who hate Serenity, essentially it is because you do not get the existentialist ANGST, you will be correct that the movie is CLOSED SHOP.Whedon essentially is a game player. He say that he wants to create a REALIST SF environment, all the while understanding that SF realism is an Oxymoron. This movie DELIBERATELY rips off every SF movie that has ever existed and ever WILL exist! But the reason is NOT TO TELL A STORY, but to pull the knowing audience into another REALITY, which at all times is patently UNREAL. I will just give just one snippet of what I mean. When the crew gets to Miranda (Shakespeare anyone?) Whedon changes the entire atmosphere into if it was a Star Trek episode! The point of this bunch of Outlaws acting like Star Trek is to show the weaknesses of Rationalism. Now the plot spoiler that the revers are the end product of an Alliance experiment is DELIBERATELY simplistic to get the audience to see what he is getting at in a direct manner. Then what is absolutely brilliant is that when the crew discovers the secret of Miranda, River suddenly announces, ""I'm better"". What is brilliant about this is that one is forced to ask this existential question - what would it mean for River to be better? This point is quite subtle. Remember that the Alliance was trying to 'cure' humanity of its violent tendencies! Spot the existential Mobius Strip anyone?If you think (like me) that this is cool, then you will realise what a Genius Mr. Whedon is, for I have not seen anyone pull off what Mr. Whedon has done with Postmodernist ideas! He completely blows Matrix Reloaded off the map! In fact he is miles better that Derrida / Paul Man / Sartre!I deduct 1 mark due to me not liking the look of the film on screen sometimes.Watch your six!",Serenity
717,jessisparkman,"A excellent bold movie, that aims to misbehave!",10,23 December 2016,"Ladies and menfolk, we have ourselves one hell of a good movie!If you don't feel motivated to do something with your life after you watch Serenity, then you need to watch it again. This is THE movie for Firefly fans that encapsulates the energy, feel, witty humor and total badass-ery that is the Firefly universe. The story fills in some of the mystery left from the TV show, and although there are 2 extremely sad parts of the story, it still makes you want more. The interaction of the characters and the movement of the story lead you through twists and turns with Captain Tight Pants Mal's good humor to accompany your journey. Nothing can take the sky away from these characters. Not even Reavers. Serenity is the religiosity that all us fuzzie-wuzzies need to complete this epic adventure, filled with thrilling heroics. The special effects are as good as the TV show times 10. We FINALLY get to have a look at the Reaver ships up close, and at the inside of what the Alliance did to poor River. This movie will make you want to be manly and impulsive and write nasty letters to Fox for cancelling the show, even thought it's been more than 10 since they killed it. It's just that gorram good.In essence, watch Serenity. Then keep your next 2 days free and clear so that you can binge watch all of Firefly. If you've already watched Firefly, watch it again. You'll never get tired of this shiny story, the ship, the characters or the universe.Keep flying and stay shiny browncoats!",Serenity
718,rulistenin14-1,Wow,10,7 October 2005,"I had pretty high expectations going into this movie but let me tell you, Serenity lived up to all of them. As an avid fan of Joss Whedon for year, each one of his shows has touched me deeply, but this movie just shows what a great writer and director he is. The actors add wit and laugher as well as show their serious side. Nathan Fillion in particular showed what a fine actor he is. People who have never seen ""Firefly"" will enjoy this movie, I know, I saw it 3 times with people who have never seen an episode and for those who have watched the show, Joss references it a couple times. Go see this movie, you will be glad you did, but be prepared to go on a journey that only Joss Whedon can take you on.",Serenity
719,ds_k7,A rival to that of even Star Wars/Trek,10,8 September 2005,"If I could give it a 20 out of 10, I would!This movie is worth seeing again and again and again. Everyone, even non-Firefly fans, can still watch it and know EXACTLY what's going on at ALL times. The movie is just absolutely amazing. I can say with reasonable assurance that you will never see another movie like it for a very long time, if ever again. Tell everyone you can about it. It's humorous, thrilling, dramatic, and action packed. You will be entertained from start to finish, guaranteed! So come September 30th...Go to your local movie theater and purchase a ticket. Then get all of your friends to come with you. You will not regret it.The cancellation of Firefly was not due to the writing, so don't try holding that against the movie. I cannot say enough how brilliant and masterfully written Serenity is, and I hope you will all see for yourselves. It's just......incredible. Amazing. Beyond words.",Serenity
720,lee-porter-1,Joss Whedon: God of all things sci fi or just standard geek?,8,6 October 2005,"In all respects of his work, Joss Whedon manages consistently and eloquently to portray the aspects and psyche of humanity; I compare firefly and serenity in many ways to Titan:AE in this respect; in all manners, the movie was a joy to watch, i felt you empathised with the correct characters, and the villains were in place to communicate that villainy, good and evil, indeed, the very state of humanity isn't all just black and white; I sense that as a continuing theme in all of Mr. Whedon's work, ranging from Toy Story and all the way up through the ranks of Buffy & Angel. Serenity is no exception. If anything, my hope is that universal picks this up as a continuing television miniseries at the very least, to continue the story of river, and to develop the characters, to give them more scope and even fill in the gaps that presented itself.I must say, that I went with a few friends, and some found the plot a little too incoherent to follow - without giving the tale away, they didn't understand the connection between river and Miranda, and left them even more bewildered because there was no situation as to how Simon came to be on the ship; the movie takes you in hot, and continues to run at a fairly fast pace...The good thing being though, that I didn't want to leave my seat to go to the toilet in case I missed something.The script itself gives us more of a glimpse of whedons whimsical and artistic matter; his attention and desire to tell a good story about people as real as they can be when they're superhuman, psychic or from the future. My only real criticism is that the camera-work wasn't nearly as good as it should have been for a movie of its potential and calibre; if a sequel is made, I seriously hope they use a few more techniques, like wide angles and panning in some places, rather than overuse of the ""video8 handy cam"" effect that law and order made so famous.I definitely noted a similar style to the artistic representation in Titan A.E., and I'm more than a little curious if the stories tie up in any way.",Serenity
721,lasmith-6,A Great TV Series to Movie Transition...,8,4 October 2005,"Interestingly enough, I never even heard of Firefly until I learned that it had been canceled. There was plenty of bitching and whining about a great show being cut short, and I had to check it out for myself. I was pleased to learn that everyone was right. This show was pretty good.I actually got some pre-screening passes for this movie and I couldn't even GIVE them away because no normal person even knew what Serenity was. It was very surprising however when I got to the theater an hour and a half early and there was a line around the block to get in.The movie, while not quite ""spielberg"" quality in terms of presentation and special effects continues the great dialog and adventure of the TV series. I'm sure the excellent writing and vision of Joss Whedon is the reason for this.All of the characters were excellent in this movie, even with the focus being more on River and the Captain. Everyone gets a bunch of good lines in.Definitely check out this movie, but if I were you I would pick up the season 1 DVD and get acquainted with the characters, storyline, and mythos first.",Serenity
722,LyraAlluse,Xia Huan Qua Saun Atao (A Damn Good Film),10,28 November 2005,"This is not your typical review. I'm not out to convince you to watch the movie or make Firefly your new favorite show. I'm just out to tell it like it is. And that's what I am going to do.People will always have a difference of opinion. If we all liked the same things, there would be no war and people wouldn't waste internet space complaining about people that do not like the same things that they do. The world would also be boring. So it evens out.I personally like Firefly and Serenity. I find the series to be a refreshing break from the six years I was forced to watch other people get caught up in the mediocre Star Wars prequels. The story was interesting and kept my attention. The characters were believable and in depth. The music kicked ass (though the CD did not compliment the movie) and the cinematography was excellent.It was a bit inconsistent from the series, but had the series been finished, I'm sure Joss would have led the story line right up to the movie.I'm going to take a quick break to be honest about the rest of Joss' work. I find Buffy and Angel to be cliché and a waste of television time slots that they should be giving to Firefly. So don't mistake me as a Joss Whedon fan because I am not. Also don't mistake me as a ""brown coat."" While I love the series and movie, I am an author and cinematographer myself so I do not get caught up in fandom. I simply appreciate good entertainment when it comes around. And Serenity was damn good entertainment.It's fresh, it's honest and it's a gem in a movie arena that's lacking in entertainment. For example; the first two Harry Potter films were good. Then they decided to take it in 'a new direction,' and have the characters wear modern clothing. And lord help us all. Whenever a director says they are going to take a film in a 'new direction,' run away as fast as you can. Because anything they make after that statement will be crap. The last two Harry Potter films were just that. But really I am getting off topic.After being exposed to so much lack of vision, it was nice to see something that was fresh and exciting. I am looking forward to the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe for the same reason.I found the story to be superb and enthralling. I found the universe to be unique and eye opening. I thought it was cool that they cussed in Chinese. Any story where there's a good plot, action, minimal romance and great character development is OK in my book. And Serenity has all of these elements.You can choose to agree or disagree. Difference in opinion is what makes the world go round. But I personally think the series is awesome and should not be overlooked. We have plenty of crappie movies and TV series wasting air space. I'm glad that Joss restored my faith in media. And that in itself is something to be noted.",Serenity
723,mr-ragu,What a shame that this isn't B.O gold...,10,5 December 2006,"I am a huge fan of Firefly and thus also of Serenity. Science Fiction about real people you really care about - which you love! There may be some flaws (e.g. it isn't as funny as the TV series - theme's too dark, maybe) - but anyway it's a 10, just for its sheer existence! Thank you, Joss Whedon, for what you and the crew have achieved - it's stunning. I'm pestering all my friend to see your stuff, and I have been successful on some. Here in Germany, the TV show has never aired, but now there's the DVDs.If you like Star Wars (the old ones), go see Serenity! Then go and get the Firefly-DVD and see it!

This is probably the best sci-fi film since Aliens. So it's a mixing of genres (cowboy/sci-fi) but then it's a long time since we had a good western either! Josh Whedon pulls it off on what is obviously a TV budget, but the witty one-liners, the excellent baddie and superb atmosphere of camaraderie (though least we forget, they have acted together through 14 episodes of this), make this a stellar big screen debut for Mr Whedon.More power to his arm. Legs too if it helps; we need more entertaining escapism like this. See it... tell your friends... they will tell theirs. A movie with brains and heart, I cannot recommend this enough!",Serenity
725,loreleidoll,One of the best TV shows which movies in the world,10,9 January 2006,"Serenity January 9th 2005 Serenity is a movie based on a space opera TV series that was on Fox and then cancelled half way through. I, my self think it was a bad call on the cancelling of the series. The movie has a work of art being as in a few minutes explains what has happened to earth and the new plants. A voice over tells what happens then the camera shows that a teacher is telling a class about it, the teacher comes up to River Tam (played by Summer Glau) and stabs her in the for head. Then it shows this was all a dream of Rivers and that they are in a lab of some kind. Her brother uses a type of flash bomb and gets her sister out of there and as their darling escape comes to a close you hear a man's voice say ""Stop."" And the clip becomes still and the man steps through the hologram of what took place that day. A start of a film that could not be bettered. I also find that the script was wonderfully written and has many memorable quotes such as ""Hell, I'll kill a man in a fair fight... or if I think he's gonna start a fair fight, or if he bothers me, or if there's a woman, or if I'm getting' paid - mostly only when I'm getting' paid."" Jayne Cobb played by Adam Baldwin.

However, overall, this is the best piece of space opera that has hit the big screen for a few years.A lot of people are hoping for a second season of Firefly, whereas I would be far more interested in a sequel to this movie.IMDb - get it together - put this film where it should be, in the Top Movies list.

As a fan of Firefly, I appreciate the effort to bring some conclusion to a great show and explain some of the mysteries they never got to develop. Creative, inventive and some great characters. I am saddened to see the end of this great show.",Serenity
728,delfin-4,Just another action film set in space.,6,6 October 2005,"Just because Serenity was set in space doesn't mean it's science fiction. If you're expecting anything more than a testosterone-driven techno-adventure you'll be very disappointed. There was no unique concept that identified this movie as science fiction rather than just another space action flick. All that would've been okay except the plot was unoriginal, the CGI was obviously under-budgeted and the acting was sub-par. Casper Van Dien could've done a better job as Serenity's captain. Any comparison between Nathan Fillion (Mal) and Harrison Ford is nothing less than heresy. Firefly was a refreshing break from the normal TV sci-fi fare but the film was just another good concept driven into the ground by Hollywood's need to appeal to the common denominator.",Serenity
729,j.freiman,Sereneity is ..... Star Wars,10,30 September 2005,"Serenity is what the ""prequel"" Star Wars movies should have been. Why couldn't Lucas have seen Joss' vision and go with it.Absolutely AMAZING.The audience was enjoying themselves so much you couldn't hear the next line given in the movie. Everyone will need to see this movie twice in the theaters and buy the DVD -- It's that good. I went with two friends who were not familiar with the television series, Firefly, and each of them wanted more - I told them about the DVDs and they are getting them this weekend. ;-)Joss is a visionary and based on his past and current success I will see EVERYTHING he directs, writes and likely produces.",Serenity
730,redjellydonut,I'm clearly missing something,7,4 October 2005,"I wasn't a fan of ""Firefly"" despite wanting to like it if only because there was a dearth of quality SF on television during the ""Firefly"" run. I gave it a few weeks, tried to con myself into thinking it was good, then realized it was really just a snooze. A buddy convinced me to see the movie version last week. Despite my hopes, the movie is almost exactly like the series, only bigger. I didn't find the dialogue particularly clever, the plot novel, nor the characters realistic. Motivations were indecipherable, the narrative was choppy, and back story slapped together. Technically, there is little to complain about. The direction was smooth, the action was choreographed cleverly, but the editing was not always as coherent as it might have been. The special effects, with the exception of some space combat late in the movie, is pedestrian at best. The performances are TV-grade fare. Summer Glau, however, is a marvel of grace. The most annoying and fatal flaw is, the same thing that felt like tin foil on my teeth with ""Firefly"", is the ridiculously contrived, crypto-futuristic argot that Whedon compels his actors to spout randomly throughout the movie. It's not clever; it's contrived and disruptive. Nonetheless, I was clearly a minority in the late-night showing I saw. There was much laughter and applause at all the pre-programmed spots all around the auditorium. As we left, as the closing credits rolled, I got a look at the target audience for ""Serenity"". I saw lots of ""Firefly"" tee-shirts in XXL. In all, it's a movie I'm glad I saw if only to confirm for myself that Joss Whedon doesn't speak to me.",Serenity
731,moffitt2,Firefly fans now feel exactly the way Star Wars fans don't,10,1 October 2005,"Artists often develop an identifiable style. It's easy to recognize the music of Led Zeppelin or Jimi Hendrix, Steven Spielberg's movies or Picasso's paintings. Most science fiction fans know I'm trying to sound like Douglas Adams when I write ""Firefly fans now feel exactly the way Star Wars fans don't"" Joss Whedon has a style all his own and Serenity definitely shows it. Someone who was familiar with ""Buffy"" would quickly recognize this as Whedon's work.And that's the only thing to criticize about Serenity. Bur since I'm one of the people that likes Whedon's work this isn't much of a criticism.For Firefly fans it is a flawless (if sometimes heartbreaking) continuation of the Firefly story arc and an absolute must see.For science fiction fans or fans of Whedon's other work, Serenity is a movie you really should try to see in theaters.But people who don't have a taste for Whedon's style should just stay away.",Serenity
732,ohkami,Lengths piece of Hollywood trash,4,1 January 2006,"Had high expectations from rating and reviews on IMDb. Lot of reviewers talking about depth of characters, intelligent dialogue etc.What a disappointment. This is just another average piece of Hollywood trash, and a lengthy one, too. Effects are okay but characters, dialogue, acting, plot are all average at best. I understand that this movie is rooted in some kind of TV series in the US, and it sure feels like that.Definitely not worth the 8.2 rating this has at the time I am writing this comment. Watch this only if you don't have to pay for it and have a fast-forward button at your disposal.",Serenity
733,clarkkent179,An outstanding ride - smart and full of heart,10,8 October 2005,"Prior to watching, I'd read some of the non-spoilery reviews by both Firefly fans and non-fans alike, who spoke about the quality of the film  ranging from some who were disappointed at the story, but praised the quality, others who were mildly surprised and entertained, and some who were all-out gushing and falling all over themselves with praise. Now I'm trying to come up with more accurate words than ""WOW"" to describe my experience, but even after having seen it now seven times, I'm still indescribably appreciative of what Joss and this truly outstanding cast has accomplished.I know, having seen this multiple times makes me appear like a rabid fanboy. But any supreme praise I give also respects the gravity of the content, and what it means for these characters we have come to know and adore over the series Firefly. It is something that is hard to verbally do justice. I can say that this IS one of the best films I have ever seen. Not just sci-fi or action. One of the best FILMS. Period.The movie starts as soon as the Universal logo appears. I mean it STARTS and grabs the audience from the get-go. I was enthralled for the next 2 hours. I swear to God. The setup is artfully done  a very nice recap for the Firefly fans, but also a superb succinct introduction into this 'verse for the Firefly virgins. The average moviegoer can watch this film as a self-contained plot and be thoroughly entertained  as was proved by comments I heard from no less than 5 or 6 non-Firefly watchers after the film  and that's just what I heard.The pacing of Serenity is spot-on, as the circumstances/relationships of each of the crew members are established, and the overall plot for the movie gets introduced. Again, I won't give spoilery information away, but Joss's ability to tie in what we should know about the characters of River and Simon, and their place among the rest of the crew, to the big, big mystery behind what really happened to River and what she knows is just amazing. Some of the shooting of the sets and actors  with some hand-held/steady-cam  is reminiscent of the series, but with a harder, edgier tone. And the lighting of the characters/scenes marks the biggest differences between the show and this film, IMO. There is a blue-ish hue to many of the indoor scenes, and the contrasting of light and dark is stark at times. It makes for an impending-doom vibe that works well to establish the ""here-and-now"" immediacy of the danger all of these people are in. It's hard to accurately explain, but easier to understand if you see the film. And also, Joss makes damn good use of his less-than-$50-million budget. Some of the space flight/battle scenes are as good as anything to come out of Lucasfilm or ILM. There are less of them, naturally, but each one sure counts. I was simply blown away by how integral to the story all the visual effects are. Nothing is wasted here just for ""the pretty"".I'm not going to summarize the story or what happens to the characters, but I will definitely say that the outcome of this film will profoundly affect the way you view these characters, and reminisce upon Firefly as a series forever. There is almost a sort of paradigm-shift in the way these characters will view their world from now on, and how they will respond to the threats posed to them. Joss goes for the jugular as well as the heart-strings, and he succeeds wildly  more than I even suspected he might. There are moments that keep you on the edge of your seat with the action; moments that make you laugh out loud with the sharp wit and sarcasm that permeates all of Joss's dialogue; moments that make you nervous with anticipation of ""what can possibly happen next?""; moments that will make you gasp and cringe with delight, surprise, shock and horror; and moments that will make you cry, with a feeling of your emotional center being completely ripped out of your chest, turned upside down, and stomped on a few times. At least, for the Firefly fans, I think this is how you may feel. Knowing these characters as well as I do, I commend the confidence and just plain guts that Joss shows in where he chooses to take this story.And I would be remiss if I did not mention that I cannot give enough credit to the cast. None of these players are major film stars, and few of them have ever even had much success on television. But you would never know it by the nuances shown here. There are steady progressions and evolutions that viewers of the series will be able to see in each of them. Their respective journeys on and off Serenity have culminated them all into the people we see here, and all of the roles are brought to the larger-than-life silver screen with heart, and a true emotional investment into what happens to each of them.When Joss has said in interviews that this is the hardest thing he has ever had to write, I completely believe him. He is essentially condensing a couple of television seasons' worth of story arcs into a jam-packed 2 hour feature. That kind of task is monumental, in order to satisfy the die-hard Firefly fans, while at the same time initiating a brand new audience, not getting them lost in this 'verse in the process. For everything that he was able to accomplish on both of those fronts with Serenity, I think this is just about the best work  film or TV  that he has ever done.Even after multiple viewings, I still get stunned with awe. I don't know what else to say. Go see it. You won't be disappointed",Serenity
734,betawho,I got to watch it in 3-D!,10,24 May 2006,"This is one of the best all time sci-fi movies. If you're a fan of Firefly or not this is a movie to watch. Unlike a lot of the sci-fi stuff we get out today it wasn't all sound and fury with no story to hold it together. Serenity has a beautifully thought out storyline, a cast of some of the best, most well thought out, characters in sci-fi, and special effects that are great in themselves but know not to try to take over the movie. I saw this in 3-D due to a special 3-D kit of the movie I got off eBay. The space scenes were gorgeous and Serenity itself looked totally realistic. It was a real gas getting to go through the different rooms and holds of the ship and see them in 3-D. And the hovercraft chase was excellent! If you haven't seen this movie before you need to watch it. If you like it, you're lucky that it also has a series on DVD that you can watch as well, prolonging your fun. (By the way, the glasses that came with the kit turned my DVD of the Firefly episodes 3-D too! Great fun!) All sci-fi fans should give this movie a try.",Serenity
735,Gamegeek,Serenity easily the best sci-fi movie ever!,10,19 July 2006,"I once read that a American newspaper(I won't say which one) said Star Wars Episode III:Revenge Of The Sith was the best sc-fi movie of 2005 but there where only 2 sci-fi film out in 2005 Star Wars and Serenity.Star Wars got mixed reviews but was extremely disappointing and was one of the biggest grossing films of all time while Serenity was getting 5 stars here,there, and everywhere and yet made over 20 times less money at the box office,and Serenity managed to get 86nd place in the greatest movies of all time in a film magazine(I won't say which one).But I suppose that's what the world is coming to,if its got anybody famous in the movie,its got a gigantic budget,and its over-hyped then of course its going to make loads of money just like Pirates of the Caribbean 2 rubbish film(pretty much) but loads of money oh wait its got famous stars,gigantic budget,and its over-hyped.Serenity is a masterpiece in everyway the story is superb despite the ending being a tad disappointing but not compared to SW:ROTS,the acting is great for a bunch of TV actors and actresses with not that much experience,the dialogue is witty,funny,and even intelligent.To make this movie of a budget of 40M is outstanding,the effects are on par with any other sci-fi film(yes I mean Star Wars III),and the old western influence is a nice idea which works brilliantly(but its far more obvious in Firefly).Joss Wheldon is simply the best director, producer,and writer out there.Serenity is just simply the best sci-fi movie ever.",Serenity
736,johnny-386,"Great Movie, but Much Better Show!",9,16 March 2007,"First, this is a great movie. No doubt about it. It has the whole shibang; action, comedy, romance, and the rest. Its special effects increased dramatically from the show, and it builds on the characters from the show, so if you haven't watched most of the show, this is gonna be a confusing movie to watch. But what let me down, and why I didn't give it a ten, is that the plot from the show seems to be heading towards one aspect of the plot, but this movie takes a completely different turn, so it might annoy some faithful fans of the show. All in all, great movie, worth seeing it at least once, and maybe a second if you are really into the show.",Serenity
737,JAMES-FINKE,It Makes Sense Now,8,25 May 2021,"Watching this film I had a feeling that there is some back story missing. So it is the continuation of a TV series, which I have never seen. I did not know that. With that said, it is fine and more than watchable. The girl is nubile, thin and has legs you want to lick. The brother is noble, but his love interest is never realized. The villian is evil and well played, as is the greedy captain.Watch this one.",Serenity
738,cordrone,Top of the line Sci-Fi great to watch even if you're not a Sci-Fi fan.,10,6 February 2007,"An excellent Sci-Fi adventure with an honest, personable, and charismatic cast of actors. The special effects are great but secondary to the unique and well played main characters (all of which are from the original television series FireFly). My only regret was that I saw the movie before I watched the original TV series. (The movie lead me to watch the TV series on DVD) For the best over all experience (though it stands on it's own just fine) I highly recommend you watch the FireFly TV series first before seeing the movie. Fortunately (unfortunately as it turns out) there is only one season of the show you'll have to watch which makes watching the TV show on DVD or iPod download not very hard or overly time consuming to do.The thing I like best about both the series FireFly and the resulting movie Serenity is that you need not be a Sci-Fi fan to really enjoy it. It's the main characters, the obvious chemistry they have with one another, and very clever and witty writing that really drives both series and movie.EDIT and Important Note: Firefly, the show Serenity the movie was based upon, lasted only 1 season between 2002-2003. While Fox axed the show it still received an Emmy, rave reviews, and was popular within the industry itself. As a result many of the elements and ideas of Firefly have been replicated in shows and movies between the time the show was taken off the air and Serenity was produced. I've noticed a lot of comments don't take into account the age of the show or movie when they state that ""Stuff you've seen a million times, rehashed, etc."" when the truth of the matter is that the reason things seem that way is because they originated or were expounded upon from Firefly in the first place. FYI.",Serenity
739,gatraylor,Can't believe I missed the show,9,7 May 2007,"I rented this on a whim and was not ready for how good it turned out to be. I wound up watching it 2 times in 24 hours. This has led me to the show from which it came, Firefly, and I can't believe I've found all this after it has been canceled as I can't believe that it was canceled. Serenity (and Firefly) are a mixture of great dialog and humor, action, and nice special effects all tinged with an American West theme. If someone had tried to describe it to me, I don't think I would have watched it personally, but having stumbled upon it, I am completely hooked. For the fans of Firefly, expect that this is 'taken up a notch' from the show. More action for sure. Serenity may give you a glimpse of where Joss Whedon was planning on taking the show had it not been canceled. I especially love the transformation of River... but enough said. Just go see it.",Serenity

I prefer this method of movie picking- tell me if it's worth my money or not, and let me experience the whole thing without somebody else's prejudices. Anyway, I knew it was sci-fi, and adventure, so I was expecting fighting and blood. What I got? Clever dialog, amusing effects, amazing choreography, compelling story, all bound together with a lovable cast and plenty of action- it was everything I need in a movie, and I didn't check my watch once.

It has a little bit of everything, but not to much of anything, just a nice blend of things, destined to be a future, heck, already is a cult classic.May I also recommend the companion books and guides, very helpful in the 'verse.",Serenity
742,Kevin_J,Serenity Flies High,9,30 September 2005,"In 2002, Joss Whedon, the creator of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and 'Angel' brought to television a new series called 'Firefly.' Despite being loved by the fans, it was unjustly tried and convicted by studio execs and killed off after only airing 11 episodes. 'Serenity' is the major motion picture from the 'Firefly' 'Verse...The film starts off with some background on the characters of Simon and River Tam, and how Simon frees her from an Alliance ""school"" where she has been subjected to numerous horrific tests. We also are introduced to the main Villain of the film, ""The Operative."" His job is to find the Tam's and bring them back.We then cut to the ship ""Serenity"" as she is flying through space towards a planet where it's crew  lead by Captain ""Mal"" Reynolds, has a job waiting for them. Captain Reynolds and his crew are - for lack of a better term  people for hire. You need something done/stolen/etc., you call on the crew of ""Serenity."" We also learn that two of the ""crew"" of ""Serenity""  Shepherd Book and Inara Serra  have left the ship in the intervening months (this film supposedly takes place 6 months after the ""Firefly"" episode ""Objects in Space"").Suffice it to say that things go wrong, and this leads directly into the peril that the crew will face from the ""Operative"" and his masters, the ""Alliance."" Captain Reynolds and his crew have several tasks to undertake: keep one step ahead of the enemy; find out what secret is driving River Tam insane, and protecting themselves against other evils, not only in the blackness of space, but the evil that man can do to his fellow human beings.This all comes together in an enormous space battle between the Alliance and a group of mutants called ""Reavers."" It seems like nearly every science-fiction movie has to have a space battle, but this one was very smartly thought out.The music was composed by David Newman, and he did a magnificent job. He had action cues where needed, suspenseful cues when called for, and basically hit every note right in scoring this film. It definitely added to the story, as most excellent film scores are designed to do.There is almost everything in this film that any fan of Firefly, or any fan of science fiction, can appreciate. It has suspense, warmth, action, adventure, terror, and all of it rolled up into a two-hour movie. This is a film that actually was intelligently shot and produced, not like many films that come out of Hollywood today, where you can check your brain at the door because of the films' simplistic and stupid pandering to the masses. ""Serenity"" stands above all that: it brings you into the story, does its level best to get you emotionally attached to the characters, so you feel what they feel, and care about them. That is the function of a well-written film: to get you involved with the characters.Hopefully this is not the end of Captain Reynolds and the crew of ""Serenity"" on the big screen (or small screen). A film (or television show) like this comes only once in a great while, and it deserves every accolade it can garner. Fans of the TV show and non-fans alike will be able to enjoy this film. The fans because they can re-connect with their favorite characters and the non-fans can enjoy a great science-fiction film.",Serenity
743,crowcaster,ugly spaceship stars in good movie,8,11 October 2007,"Alright. Before I start this review, I would like to say that I'm not a fan of Firefly, nor was I aware that Serenity is based on that series when watching the movie.Still, I definitely liked it. Serenity is a solid movie with very few scenes that are likely to procure boredom, the audiovisual effects are fairly good as well. While not likely to win this picture any Oscar nominations, the storyline is also pretty decent. You don't have to know anything about the series to enjoy this movie. There are no surprising twists to it that the experienced movie-goer won't see coming a mile away, but it's entertaining to watch the events unfold. Although the narrative isn't wildly imaginative, it still more than measures up to other contemporary sci-fi action movies like Star Trek Nemesis, Transformers or Spider Man. If there are any weak points, I guess I would have to name the characters first. While the captain and a few others are sufficiently credible, stereotypes like Jayne (really likes guns) and Kaylee (really likes sex) are rather ridiculous. Also, the way the story is told basically just begs for the audience to miss the ""important"" parts. If you busy yourself with some movie snacks at the wrong moment, you're most likely to wonder ""why the hell did they do that"" in the next scene. Which is (I guess) the biggest complaint that other commenters have about this picture.The only really big plot-holes I spotted (***SPOILER ALERT!***) were the death of the pilot (maybe those things that came through the front window were explained in the series?!?) and the ominous reason why the ""operative"" helped them repair the ship afterwards (who somehow didn't die after having his throat crushed?!?). OK... so maybe there were some pretty undeniable plot-holes.Still, I would rate the movie above average. It's not something that future generations will remember, but it's fun to watch and it's one of those movies that you can always enjoy for the umpteenth time when there's nothing else on TV.",Serenity
744,dougalg,This film loosely continues the story that was began in Firely with the plucky crew and their dangerous stowaways...,6,2 October 2005,"I rated this film a 6, but would rate the 15 episodes of Firefly as a 9 or so. Why the discrepancy? Well, the main reasons are fairly stylistic. The style of Firefly was one of slow measured progression, occasionally punctuated by fight scenes, but those weren't my favorite episodes. To make this movie in true Firefly style, it would have had to have been at least 1.5 times the length it was, or maybe even twice the length.Additionally, the movie carries on some of the (for science fiction) innovative technical aspects that made Firefly lovable. Unfortunately, it also seems to lapse into certain Hollywood clichés that somehow never came up in Firefly. I'm thinking in particular of one scene involving Shepherd Book, which I shan't give away as it's a spoiler.Additionally, the focus of the movie is very different from the series in several ways, firstly, the series made sure all the characters had relatively equal time, but here not so, it seems fairly unbalanced towards Zoe, Mal and the Tams, with the others being relegated to minor bit parts. Secondly the focus of the movie in terms of major ""villain"" takes a direct turn from the series the villains from the series are gone, and replaced with another totally different one, and the motives of the alliance are totally different, not to mention that the doctor now knows substantially more about his sister than before...I guess a lot of this was ""necessary"" n order for the movie to happen, but I would much rather the show getting picked up by a new channel and being allowed to do justice to the back-plots and characters, rather than trying to mash it all into a short 2 hours, as well as bring a conclusion to it all...",Serenity
745,sigggy,Great Ride,10,30 September 2005,"I saw Serenity last night. I am a bit of a newbie to the Firefly universe having only seen three episodes thus far, introduced to the series through a promotional episode given away with Empire magazine here in Australia. I have realised what a shame Fireflry was canceled but the movie is great. It is usual practice now for movies to be hidden away until opening day and released to the public with huge marketing to get them in the doors before they read he reviews and realise that the film they have seen is no good. The makers of Serenity realised they had a good product and put it out to the people with early screenings and reviews as they knew it would be a word of moth film and build as it goes along. It was a brave move in these quick release, short run times. Judging by the full cinema on the second night here in Melbourne Australia the film will do well. Hopefully leading to future installments. The characters, dialog and interaction in this movie are fantastic. I found the plot and locations very interesting and it was good to go to a film where not all the major characters get out unharmed. I am sick of recent blockbusters where the main characters are invincible and you just watch them go from action sequence to action sequence without any conn-sequence. The action in the movie kept pulses racing, there were a lot of laughs. The tension on the screen certainly spilled over to the audience. There was a bit at the end when one character took on many reavers which seemed a little too far fetched for me, but all in all What a Ride!!!",Serenity
746,rquinn3-1,One of my all time favorites,10,31 December 2007,"This was a wonderful experience for me. I rented Serenity simply because it looked interesting. I did not know who Josh Weldon was or that the show Firely had ever been on TV.After the viewing, I thought to myself that these characters are too well defined, the chemistry is just too damn good. This led me to a little research which quickly led me to the story of the Firely series, the bungling by the networks, and the eventual triumph of at least creating a swan song for a series that should have survived for years.If you are looking at a long fireside weekend or want to enjoy something with the kids, I strongly suggest you rent the 14 Firefly episodes, watch them first, and then watch Serenity. Do not rent the first few episodes or all the series w/o the movie or you will be kicking yourself Ark 3:00 AM when you want to know what happens next.",Serenity
747,cjp2157,Great movie for fans of Firefly; so-so for the uninitiated,7,7 October 2018,"Great movie for fans of Firefly. My only complaint is that it feels like an extended episode rather than a self-contained grand story. If you're not a fan of the show Firefly then this might feel very dated and you might not enjoy the character interactions as much. The characters do not really have arcs and some moments that are very significant and shocking to fans of the show will be very meh if you haven't seen it.

748,darkwolfe-dcn,One of the best sci-fi movies ever,8,2 October 2005,"Sci-fi movies of recent times have all been cliché action flicks or rip-off of popular movies. Serenity is a unique movie with well written dialog and characters with just the right touch of comedy. It's a blend of sci-fi and western (kind of like the animes Cowboy Beebop and Trigun with a sprinkling of Han Solo smuggling/pirate)--a continuation of the Firefly TV series that was canceled but still has a cult following. While it's not necessary to watch the series before the movie, it does give it more back-story. I would've wanted more plot themes and characters to appear from the series, but hopefully sequels (which the director said will be possible if the movie does well) are made that will address it. The movie takes place after some time has passed from the end of the Firefly series. The captain, Mal Reynolds, and crew are up to their usual small time crime jobs on the fringe of the verse in order to get a payload. Dr. Simon Tam and his sister, River, are still fugitives wanted by the Alliance. They, of course, run into the oppressive Alliance during the course of the movie and things heat up. The movie does finally explain why they want her so bad and a few other explanations are also revealed in the movie. Along the way new characters and places are introduced and some unexpected and terrifying twists occur at the end of the movie. This is one movie you do not wish to miss if you are a fan of sci-fi, westerns, or great characters and dialog.",Serenity

Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised when I found that the story is fairly simple, the characters are interesting enough to get you to pay attention to them enough to be able to tell what they are about and yet still be pleasantly surprised in the end. Being a fan of Joss Whedon's work, I was not at all disappointed since his trademark banter is interwoven throughout the movie. A fan of Sci-Fi? I would definitely recommend you watch this movie. A fan of good movies in general? Another definite recommend.",Serenity
750,jnorris441,Better than I expected,10,30 September 2005,"I am a Browncoat, so I'm a little biased. I really wanted to love this movie, and for the most part I did. Just a couple of things detracted from my enjoyment: In a few instances, Whedon's trademark dialogue seemed a little clunky and silly this time around. There are scenes where Mal is being absolutely serious, and he says something in Whedon-speak...and you try not to laugh at how melodramatic and silly the moment is. I felt myself cringe once or twice.Something else I absolutely hated: Mr. Universe. What a crappy idea for a character! How about ""Mr. Annoying Jewish Stereotype."" It would have been cooler if they had to fight their way into an Alliance transmission station, rather than insert this guy. It even took me out of the movie every time they mentioned his name, especially what should have been an emotional funeral scene. There's Book's tombstone, Wash's tombstone...oh, who's that in the middle? MR. UNIVERSE?? More than a couple people in the audience laughed. It seemed like he was only there to say ""Can't stop the signal"" multiple times.I miss Wash. I knew Wash would die, but it happened so quickly! I was pretty shocked. Whedon really had to kill someone to make it believable, and since Alan wanted it to happen I'm at peace with it.That last scene with Mal and Zoe in the cargo bay needed something more.Now the things that kicked ass: River's ""My Turn"" moment where she goes medieval on some Reavers and her first fight on Beaumont. The introduction of the ship. The final space battle, when the Reaver ships emerge from the ion cloud. Simon and Kaylee get jiggy. And Mal finally gets to stick it to the Feds.All in all, it rocked.

751,frankguth,Good watchable movie,7,23 July 2011,"I started writing reviews (this is my 1st) because I felt that most other reviews tend to pick movies apart whether that be the acting, cinematography, soundtrack or whatever the reviewer happens to like or dislike. When reading a review I want to find out if the movie is worth watching.I only want to comment on the entertainment value. If the entertainment value is, in my opinion, lacking then I'll reflect that in my vote.Having said that ""Serenity"" is a good solid SciFi that is very enjoyable & watchable. This movie falls into my category ""I would hire it to watch it but, I would not go to the cinema to watch it""",Serenity
752,lmurray-1,One of the best sci-fi movies ever - Bar None!,10,10 October 2005,"I was a fan of the TV series so i guess i had a head start. However, this movie delivers everything that made the series outstanding but more of it and bigger. What's even better, you don't have to know the series to appreciate it. There are some surprises, some shocks, some loose ends get tied up and a few plot lines come to fruition. The action is intense, the humor is witty and often laugh-out-loud funny, the tension is unbearable in places and the characters are larger than life and all too human at the same time. I'd say that this movie is on a par with any major action-adventure I've ever seen, sci-fi or not. My only fear is that too few people will see it and there won't be a sequel...",Serenity
753,Deanna8799,BIG Disappointment,1,15 April 2009,"I was an avid fan of the series, Firefly. I loved the well developed characters, sharp, witty dialogue, and dynamic plots. I was disappointed when the show was canceled after one season. Firefly had a lot to offer. So, when I heard that a movie was coming out, of course, I was excited.I have never been so disappointed in a movie. The plot was everywhere, taking on too many of the undeveloped themes from the show: the Reavers, River... It was a desperate attempt to sew up the loose ends, but in the end there were more questions than answers. Where the show balanced light hearted humor with drama, throughout the movie the tone was depressing. There was no humor, no wit, no heart. The small glimpses of the show were immediately squashed by some pretentious need to be morbidly serious. This was probably due the high death toll... I believed that this movie was going to be a reunion, a tribute, and homage to the show, bringing back and honoring the characters everyone knows and loves for one more adventure. Instead, the most well beloved characters are killed in a degrading fashion. I know it's in Whedon's nature to kill characters off. But this is a movie of a canceled TV series! Give us a break! Why can't the cast survive one movie? Even the characters we were briefly introduced to died. So, why do Firefly fans love this move?! I'm baffled! This movie has nothing to do with Firefly. The only explanation I can come up with is that Firefly fans were just so happy to get their show back, they didn't stop to think about what they were getting. This movie crushed me in way I never imaged. I morned my cherished image of the Firefly world. It was unimaginably a horrible movie experience. This movie was the product of a bitter man. Joss Whedon, why did you have to destroy a great idea? Why did you kill off the characters we loved and respected in a demeaning way? This is a bad representation of the Firefly universe, see the TV show, if you like it, don't ruin it by seeing Serenity.",Serenity
754,rkean,Great Sci Fi,8,18 October 2005,"Just watched this this evening. In a nutshell, i thought it was great, great story, good script and (bar the first 10/15 mins) the acting was solid.Great banter between the crew with some great touches of humour within a script that Lucas would die for with adults talking like adults.Action scenes, linking scenes and everything was solid but the attribute that made it for me was that threw in humour and surprises when other sci fi films wouldn't.I hope the network that cancelled firefly finishes the first series and keeps and commission's another. Well done Mr Whedon.Go see it, highly recommended.",Serenity
755,Merciful_Zeus,"Hold on to something, it's one bumpy ride!",9,15 October 2005,"I'll be clear from the outset. I was a huge fan of ""Firefly"", the short-lived Fox TV show from which this film has risen. Still, Joss Whedon as a movie director was unproven: he's written scripts, doctored scripts, even been Oscar-nominated for one. But he's never directed until now. From seeing the work of seasoned directors on other genre offerings this year, believe me, you'd never know it. Serenity is a blast. From the first jump cut between main character River's early life and her time in a government lab (I won't elaborate, that would be telling) to the very last second before the end credits (I almost expected to see ""Executive Producers etc"" flash up on the screen), this is trademark Joss at his best.If you know nothing of ""Firefly"", indeed any of Mr Whedon's TV offerings, it doesn't matter. Even if you're not particularly a fan of the genre, don't worry. The only requirement for seeing this movie is to be a fan of a good story. Nathan Fillion makes the step up to big screen lead effortlessly: one giant leap for his agent, one small step for him, it appears.The insistence of so many studios on a big name to sell a film is invariably what drags it down. Here the only names regular movie-goers may be familiar with are Gina Torres, who appeared in the Matrix sequels (well, she is Mrs Fishburne) and Alan Tudyk, best known for ""A Knight's Tale"", ""Dodgeball"" (he was the pirate-impersonating Steve), and perhaps more significantly, Sonny, the lead CGI character in Alex Proyas's ""I, Robot"". So essentially a cast of unknowns. Kudos to Joss Whedon for getting a movie deal which insisted on such control over casting.Directors like Michael Bay could benefit from studying this film. If the greatest problem with the whole sci-fi genre on the big screen is its over-reliance on visual effects, almost always at the expense of story, then the same aspect of Serenity is perhaps its only minor letdown. A $150 million sci-fi movie will spend almost as much of the budget on its VFX as Serenity did on the whole production. If only a few more million were spent on touching up some of the less convincing shots, Serenity could have been near-perfect (an aerial view of the home planet of a character called ""Mr Universe"" stands out as one such underdone sequence - it was used in a trailer, and I seriously thought it must have been unfinished at the time).Nevertheless, I would urge everyone who just wants to be entertained to go see this movie, and enjoy it. If you go with an open mind, you'll be handsomely rewarded. If you go with dim preconceptions, maybe this will be the film which opens that mind of yours. I'm confident there will be a sequel, and then moviegoers in 2008 or whenever will be scratching their heads, wondering why they missed the first one. Don't be left wondering.",Serenity
756,Amica_Temporis,Joss is unbelievable,9,3 October 2005,"There were times the entire theater laughed; there was a time we all gasped in unison. I had to cover my mouth with my hands to keep from hyperventilating and going hysterical when I realized what Mal had planned. I wanted to cheer when... No, that would be a spoiler.There are elements within this movie that are distinctly Joss. The credits are imposed over one long, uncut scene that takes us through the whole ship (yes, they built the ship as one big set, not a bunch of little ones) meeting the whole crew. There's one more line after the ending blackout. One thing happens that I really, really wish hadn't, but it was so well done I had to forgive him.So why did I only rate it a 9 instead of the full 10? Two reasons. It took a little while for it to go from just plain good to gee-I'm-glad-I-don't-have-to-use-the-bathroom amazing. And there were a few, mostly small but one rather significant, bits of discontinuity from the series. But again, so well done that I had to forgive him.",Serenity
757,Strdncr5,Worth Seeing Several Times,10,9 October 2005,"As one who loved ""Firefly"" from the start, I wasn't surprised by how much I adore the movie -- nor was I surprised to go all emotional as the story progressed and bad things happened to good people. What has surprised me is how well I've enjoyed the movie through repeated viewings (three at last count). ""Serenity"" should be seen more than once. The first time is so shocking that many of the subtle nuances are lost, and that's a gorram shame. Keep your eyes open for the little homey touches that make the Jossverse such a good one; like the name sign over the door of Kaylee's compartment. If you haven't yet seen ""Serenity,"" why not? If you have, see it again...and again...and again...",Serenity
758,fairres,Great Movie,9,1 October 2005,"Just like the TV show the comedy runs through the entire film, and makes all the difference in the world in this type of film. All the characters are so well defined, and the effects are big budget. Even get new wardrobes. Kaylee has the funniest lines by far. Jewel did a great job. LOL. All in all one of the best movies of the 2000,s.Of course the rievers, reevers? play a big big part in the entire movie. We learn a lot about them that we didn't know. River's character is revealed in some very real ways that make her much more human and endearing than before. Ditto the doctor, only he's not so mysterious. Shame that the Doc and Kaylee didn't have several seasons to completely explore a relationship. And the same for the beautiful Inara and Mal. I don't know if sequels will ever come after seeing the film. I hope they do. I want to see more of this quality. Alas Farscape, Firefly, B5, why couldn't it have happened to Buck Rogers or some other piece of garbage.",Serenity
759,TOWATL,What a thrill ride this is!,10,11 March 2006,"The excellence of ""Serenity"" is overwhelming!I have seen this movie twice in the past 48hrs and I still haven't had enough of it. The way the characters are played feels so real, they almost jump off the screen in front of you. While none of the actors can be considered a ""Star"" yet, their performance is brilliant nonetheless. I do not want to spoil the plot for you, but rest assured there is enough action and great dialog even before the title credits are shown. The story is very well written and I love the fact that the heroes are outlaws. This movie grips you from frame one and does not let go even hours after you've seen it through.Si-Fi hasn't been this exciting in a long time! Go see it - you won't regret it!Sadly, I have never had a chance to see ""Firefly"", because they did not broadcast it in Europe. But I just ordered the DVD-Box from Amazon... :-) And the soundtrack is awesome as well...",Serenity
760,nikajan,Shiny,10,11 April 2007,"I love this film. I'm not a huge fan of Sci-Fi, but Serenity blew me away. The characters are engaging, there's great humour in the script, and the storyline kept me interested. Just wish I knew what they were saying when they speak Chinese! Watching this got me into Firefly. It's such a shame it was cancelled. Love the crew, the universe joss Whedon created and the little details like their slang. The ship is not too slick and perfect, which adds a great deal of character, and really enables viewers to identify more with the crew, a group of underdogs in a tumbledown ship trying to evade the authorities. The Reavers are frankly rather scary. Overall, this film comes off very well, you really feel the chemistry between the crew as well. Brilliant!",Serenity
761,JohnSmithNot1882,Not as good as the show.,6,21 January 2012,"This review contains many spoilers and this is your final warning. These spoilers include spoilers to the show ""Firefly"".All my reviews start with what I expected, what the movie is and what I thought of it.I expected this movie to start where the TV show left off and produce a meaningful conclusion since the idiots at Fox cancelled the show after only one season.Unfortunately the movie decided to alter many of the best parts of the show replacing quality with cheap low quality sci-fi crap. Some of the characters look like funny ghouls and zombies from the 50's B movies. Why? I cannot think of a better way to write this review, then going in chronological order of the movie.Instead of using previous villains which were great characters and few killed off, the movie adds a new villain who reminds me of a bad sci-fi villain. Why not bring back the mysterious agents or the bounty hunter, who was not killed in the final show and what about Niska? Reavers, who were scary and mysterious in the show, are laughable and idiotic zombies in the movie. The last scene is joke because reavers are supposed to be regular people who last their minds, not brainless ghouls without any hand-eye coordination. The only image the show provides of a reaver is the only survivor of a ship attacked by them and he mutilates himself to look like one. He was scary because he still looked human, but very crazy. This is what reavers in the movie should have looked like, not the brainless ghoul look. My last major gripe was what happened to River. In the show she is extremely intelligent and able to use her intelligence to utilize guns, ships and enjoys dancing. The movie changes her character into the Hulk, but instead of anger, subliminal messages make her kill everyone. This once again leads me back to the climax of the movie. It can be summarized by ""The Matrix"" meets ""Night of the Living Dead"". Neither of which belong in this movie. All that said the movie is not all bad. It does start exactly where the show left off and other then River and the villain everyone else is the same. In fact, the parts between the beginning with the annoying villain and idiotic ending are quite good other than River going all Hulk. I recommend everyone who enjoyed the show to watch the movie, but do not watch the movie if you have not seen the show. The show is much better and watching the movie first will ruin the show. In my rating system 1-10 and 1 is the worst movie, 10 is perfect and 5 is average. This movie is a 6/10. Above average. It is a shame because if it was as good as the show I would rate it at least an 8/10.",Serenity
762,DaStooza,so so so so so so so good,10,14 April 2006,"I watched this movie purely as a sci fi fan. I (unfortunately) never watched Firefly, (mistakenly) didn't go to the pictures to watch this on the big screen, then (eventually) rented the movie on DVD. How stupid did I feel? How did I not watch Firefly? Why didn't I see this sci-fi masterpiece on the big screen? Am I nuts? From the setting, to the script, the performances, the directing, the humour, the action and the Reavers this is a tremendous feat in sci fi movie making. Every critic in the world raved about this film and because of ignorant nutters like me this film didn't take half the box office gross that it truly deserved. It is with this shame that a sequel will probably not get made and that is a crime against cinema. Congratulations to Joss Whedon and Nathan Fillion and all the cast and crew for this awesome movie spectacle and please please please make a sequel and I promise faithfully I will be there at the cinema for opening night. A wonderful film. Well Done.",Serenity
763,wse-jack,"Intense, funny, almost touching in a sense, one of the best by far",9,29 December 2005,"I watched only a few episodes of the Fox series Firefly before it was abruptly canceled, it seemed the moment I was hooked it was canceled. You can imagine my excitement when I saw the trailer for it in the theater early last spring.To my amazement it was not only a good movie, but also the best one I had seen since Crash. Its the story of the price and value of freedom, its a story of love and friendship, it's also the story of an ordinary group of people just trying to get by in a world where it gets harder to do just that every passing day. A lot of people will be able to relate to it and that's what makes it so special and it's not just the story that rings home, but the characters as well.In a world where good movies are few in comparison the to amount of cheap crap thrown out to the masses by backers such as Fox and Disney, Serenity is a rare gem. It actually had an original story (derived from the show of course) and put it together with smashing intense action and humor that failed to be corny despite that genre's reputation. Maybe it's the down to earth (no pun intended) attitude of the movie, maybe its just one of those things that just seems to work, but the move clicked with me and every one I know who has seen it.I usually don't see pg-13 movies on account of most of the ones today being converted kids films but please don't let that stop you from taking it seriously, the movie is realistic, intense and adult. I grantee that once you see this film you will buy the TV series DVD set soon after wanting more of what you just saw.",Serenity
764,sushiandrice,Just as good as everyone says,10,9 October 2005,"In a business that's mostly cold, sterile and unwilling to make changes, it takes something truly special to break through. Serenity is just that. A heart-warming, gung-ho, sci-fi/drama/comedy/western from wunderkind Joss Whedon, there's simply nothing quite like it: best epitomised with the apparent inability to market it accordingly. And as much as I enjoy Batman Begins, War of the Worlds and even The Island ; no mainstream film released this year (or in recent years) can even come close to capturing the brutally unique tone of this one. Leagues ahead of tack Gungans and yawn taxation talks, Serenity deserves to be seen by as many eyes as possible and, for want of a better expression, is absolutely f*cking brilliant.Continuing the travels of our band of nine merry space monkeys from the prematurely and unfairly aborted Firefly, the feature film effort Serenity set five hundred years in the future is every bit as rich and nuanced as the show; if a little more to the point given one of the medium's advantages. It follows a crew of subsistent scavengers living on the raggedy edge of the universe, scraping a living on their ship Serenity mostly uninterrupted, only the fugitive psychic they've got on board also happens to be well-toned ass-kicker with a government operative on her tail. As you'd expect this causes a few problems.The ensemble is stunning. So comfortable in their character's own skin by now, Whedon doesn't need to provide catch-ups for newbies to the 'verse (although it's written fairly shrewdly) and you immediately feel the essence of all involved from preacher to mechanic. The people of Serenity are what make the movie special, they give the film a tangible pulse. Deep and caring but also with their little imperfections, every crew member on the ship is as important as the last, and Whedon makes sure you know this with an instant yet hardened vulnerability. Of course given the nature of a film with nine main characters not everyone can get as much screen time as they'd like, and this is one of the areas where I can freely pick nits. The most mysterious characters from the show -Inara and Book- are moved to the sidelines and must seem unnecessary to the unordained, but for hardcore Whedonites it's something of a shame. Not that this hurts the film in any way (everyone still gets their shiny moments), in fact it makes it a hell lot more cinematic, and one can't help but bow down to the mighty Joss for injecting the film with a boldness most would steer away from. He actually progresses the story and you feel he's making a conscious effort not to make Serenity just an extended episode of the show for his legions of fans. Put it this way: everyone has an emotional arc and there's a journey to be had.If I keep harping on about the cast and characters of the film it's because they're just so good. Nathan Fillion as Captain Malcolm 'Mal' Reynolds is the quintessential silent and strong type, at war with the rest of the world and himself, and fiercely protective of his crew. Summer Glau -who really comes into her own after not actually doing a whole lot on the show- is I guess the female lead and approaches the unpredictable River with a deft moral compass. You never know when you've got her pegged, and her spectacular fight scenes are amongst the best in the whole film. These are the obvious choices but the group as a whole is bulletproof (in particular Morena Baccarin, Alan Tudyk and Jewel Staite) and never falters, even with a condensed amount of face time. The one cast member I was worried about initially was newcomer Chiwetel Ejiofor playing an assassin, but within the space of a minute my qualms were silenced.As for the execution, Whedon is just as confident in his big screen debut, still writing for the acerbic tongue and coming across plot points that still feel fresh. The transition from TV to film is a smooth one, clearly comfortable enough to know when to let the story tell itself and when to let rip with an assured hand. In saying that, at times you feel a sense of inevitability, nonetheless this is more than cancelled out by a frustrating final act which had me lurching at the prospect that one of the main characters could come under harm. The conclusion is splendiferous to say the least, a series of rad action moments balanced to perfection with timely comedy -which is often overlooked- that builds to one of the greatest endings you could wish for. Sequels? There better be.Excuse the weak punnage, Serenity soars to new heights and refuses to come down. If there's any justice the movie will start doing some serious business worldwide, and if not, this is still a great way to go out. This isn't just closure for whimpering Browncoats, it's a continuation of a story, and there's plenty more still to be told. Fresh enough for newcomers and familiar enough to have fans wetting pants, Serenity is here to stay, and has heart no other space opera can hope to match. Easily one of the best pictures of the year with something to say about human nature, arrested development, and governmental paranoia; a majestic rendering that's head and shoulders above the usual action fodder, your movie-going days are incomplete until you've seen it.All hail the new Star Wars. You can't take the sky from them.",Serenity
765,k_qbn,"Wow, what a ride!",10,2 October 2005,"The long awaited (by series Firefly fans) has arrived and was well worth the wait. If you watched the series, the movie answers a lot of questions. The dilemma for the producers was how to attract new fans, and they have succeeded admirably. The movie begins before the series started and fills both fans and newcomers in on a lot of background information. The plot then weaves in and out of the series stories, updating the viewer while presenting a great adventure. It is exactly where the movie had to go.The world presented in Serenity is more complex that the usual action/adventure and the characters have a depth unusual for this type of movie. Of special note is the character of River who has been taken to a level beyond that of the TV series. The one negative was the character of Wash who for some reason became nothing more that a background character. The film makers still must be given credit for the complexity of the personalities and their smooth interaction. It is also great to see a balanced number of female characters that are just as important to the action and story without being macho-girls or damsels in distress.Here's to the success of Serenity and seeing more of these characters in the future.",Serenity
766,big_D_on_the_microphone,Loved this movie,10,1 December 2005,"""Firefly"" is one of my favorite shows of all time. Joss Whedon has a way of weaving words and events that for me rivals David Sedaris. You almost feel violated, but in a good way, after enjoying their works. And this movie is no different. I took my little brother to see it (and he is not a fan of anything science fiction in any way) and he really enjoyed it. For anyone that wants a good story and an enjoyable movie experience, ""Serenity"" is a fantastic movie. In my mind, it will be the next ""Princess Bride"". A movie, that while it didn't do well in the theaters, gained so much ground in video rental that it is now considered a classic. I hope ""Serenity"" does the same.",Serenity
767,thatjimguy,Gets my vote as the next great Sci-Fi franchise,9,2 September 2005,"Any sliver of doubt I may have had regarding this film was firmly removed yesterday when I saw an advanced screening. It was excellent. Yes I know that some will discredit me because I am a fan, but I am very confidant that critics and moviegoers alike will love this movie.It was near perfection, it was the most satisfying movie experience I have had all year, maybe several years. It took all the good qualities the series had and amped them up on steroids.It is still primarily a character driven, with some of the sharpest dialog my ears have heard in a long time. Maybe David Mamett could write better, but very few others can top Whedon.The plot is tight and drives forward to a satisfying conclusion. The action sequences are great; done in a fashion where you can see the action (no fuzzy jump cuts and shaky camera) and they don't look like a trapeze act either. The villain is cold and calculating, pure evil and well motivated.The acting is superb, especially Nathan Fillion and Chiwetel Ejiofor.The SFX, although sparse were well done, quality over quantity.Some would rather harp on about a movie's box office than the quality of the film, but if you a fan good action movies, SciFi and sharp dialog I urge you to see it. I doubt you will be disappointed.",Serenity

I then discovered the movie which was also highly rated. i just now saw that and completely feel that its one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen.i'd love to see more of the show, but i think whedon wrote serenity as a swan song. i hope not, but it does feel like an ending of sorts.

769,Risasi,I give it a 9 out of 10...,8,1 October 2005,"...just to be trendy and not be accused of being a ""fanboy"". || Spoilers at bottom || The plot was a bit transparent, but very well put together. Frankly I am of the opinion that shows can be 9's and 10's even if you know what is going to happen. As far as sci-fi goes this is the most original thing I have seen come along since the first matrix movie*. I own the series on DVD and saw all of them this past summer. I'd say about half the episodes I didn't care for. Too campy. And I would say the same thing about this movie. I wish it had ended on a slightly darker note. Still Whedon has gone somewhere no one has gone before. And if you watch sci-fi just to kind of sit back and enjoy it then you'll probably like this movie. Either way Lucasarts is dead, long live the 'Verse...*The first Matrix was cool, I had not heard of it and walked into the theater with a couple friends. None of knew what to expect. Anyway the first half hour left me going ""what the crap"" a lot. Personally I knew the rest of the movies would suck. With much hesitation I saw the second and wished I had not gone, then scanned through some of the transcript for the third movie and realized the Wachowski brothers were relying heavily on Frank Herbert's vision. The whole destroy an economy, things aren't really what they seem, we need a one (messiah) who will fix things, but only makes things worse in the big scheme so must sacrifice his life to try and fix his mistakes. Yeah that whole Dune/Matrix thing. ***Spoilers***1. I would liked for Whedon to have done one of two things: A: The message getting out should have caused total chaos, this would have lead to despotism and anarchy through the star system controlled by Alliance. Or: B: The message was largely ignored. Nobody really cared. Kind of like real life huh? But the Alliance would then seek to utterly destroy them. The assassin joins them and they head to new territory. This could have lead to a splinter group forming, and another Browncoats vs. Alliance war. 2. I believe they should have destroyed Serenity. Time for a new ship. Maybe they get a fancier Alliance ship? Or maybe piece together a Reavers ship. If Whedon will not destroy the ship Mal has to die eventually, I see a fork in the road. Whedon has to decide if the story is about Serenity or Malcolm Reynolds. If it's the ship the whole crew is expendable in my opinion.3. Though I am happy someone finally died I believe it would have been much more gut wrenching if Gina Torres or Jewel Staite had died. Especially if ""Kaylee"" died after her and the good doctor had their discussion about their attraction one toward another. And if you want to get real daring Reynolds dying would have really turned things topsy turvy. But being the captain of the ship and all I'm glad that didn't happen. Either way I was happy Shepherd died, he just annoyed me. And Wash getting creamed was a big surprise. 4. Lightsabers? We don't need no stinking lightsabers. But the firearms seem ""off"". Couldn't put my finger on it. Glad they mixed in some plasma and lasers along with ballistics though. I wish they would work on their tactics a bit more now, though I guess it is just a western. Also the assassin's body armor bugged the crap out of me. Why isn't everybody wearing it?Anyway I don't have anything major to criticize. These are just minor things, ideas I have that probably wouldn't be popular anyway.",Serenity

All that has changed. Serenity is a fantastic film and I loved every minute of it. I fell in love with the show (Firefly) and grew attached to the fantastic cast of characters. The film took everything you loved about the show and turned it up to 11. There isn't a single wasted moment and every scene serves a purpose. This is a great adventure and is full of well written characters and fine acting. It's sure to please anyone who misses the swashbuckling swagger of Han Solo or the camaraderie of Star Trek.

The score was also very well rounded and suited to the movie, an important aspect as music very often makes a scene. Joss Whedon was finally able to do what it was he wanted to do with the world of Firefly and I'm glad to see that it worked out so well for him. He was able to expand on the characters, and treat them as he had originally wanted to treat them, as opposed to what certain people wanted him to do with them. I plan on seeing it quite a few more times in theaters if possible, as it's very much worth every penny spent on it.",Serenity
772,sandrajensen,Candy for teenagers,4,14 March 2006,"Okay, so this isn't the worst movie I have ever seen. I saw it based on the rating here on IMDb. Something is wrong here. Okay, so it's got lots of action and a couple of cute girls and tons of special effects, but I was bored out of my mind, unless I was manipulated into tension. The acting for the most part was ham fisted and, well, what I call Lots of ACTING. I got the sense that the director had other, far better and more famous actors in mind, and told each actor to pretend thats who they were.It's not a bad story - just too much money spent on special effects, and far too little on writing a tight script. The dialogue is clunky and unbelievable.

The acting was horrible, the sequencing was all over the place, the plot line was disjointed and the special effects were unconvincing. I must have much higher standards than all the other people that rated this movie so high. I wouldn't watch this movie if there was nothing else to rent. I'd rather go watch the snow melt... I can't believe anyone paid to have this movie made and then approved its release. So the question is: Who actually enjoyed this movie to give it such a high rating.

775,talkslikegargoyle,"'Serenity' is good, solid action fare....but not much else.",7,10 January 2006,"'Serenity' is one of those films that has a difficult history. Based on the canceled Fox TV series 'Firefly', almost canceled itself, and revived through the dedicated efforts of a relatively small number of Firefly fans ('Browncoats', for those familiar with the 'verse), my hopes were high for this movie, set approximately six months after the final broadcast episode of 'Firefly'.Joss Whedon created pure gold with 'Firefly', spinning Wild West gunslingers, starships, and his trademark sense of humor into an entertaining action/adventure.'Serenity', therefore, is the logical continuation of the canceled series.Six months after the events of 'Objects in Space', little has changed. Malcolm Reynolds and the crew of the Firefly class transport ship 'Serenity' are still doing any work that needs doing, be it thieving and smuggling or honest shipping jobs and passenger work.The Alliance has not given up, however, on recovering two of Serenity's passengers: Simon Tam, a young doctor, and his troubled sister River, a tortured psychic that was horribly mutilated by the Alliance, for still-mostly-unknown reasons.'Serenity' joins this troubled 'family' with work running scarce. The all-powerful Alliance has been coming down increasingly hard on small shipping vessels in an effort to 'smoke out' Serenity and her crew. Simon and Mal Reynolds are coming up against each other more and more often as tension mounts among the rest of the crew.Thrown into this mix is a mysterious hunter, who will stop at nothing to 'retrieve' River for his Alliance superiors, a man known only as 'Mr. Universe', and a troubled, gifted child that might prove to be their salvation, or their undoing.On the whole, 'Serenity' works as a film. The action is tightly-scripted, Joss Whedon's trademark humor can be seen throughout, and the characters are just as well-developed.What is missing in this film is direction. For those unfamiliar with the television series, 'Serenity' drops the viewer straight into the action with very little explanation of who the characters are and why they're on Serenity's crew together, who and what the 'Alliance' represents, and the significance of the ship's name (and the ship played a large role in the series; it was called 'the tenth character' by Joss Whedon himself, among others).'Serenity' is also hit-and-miss as a film when compared to the 'Firefly' series. Where the series was sharp and quick (a necessity for television broadcasting), 'Serenity' seems slightly sluggish when the bullets aren't flying.One place that Joss Whedon's humor is sadly missed is among the characters. The dialogue is certainly not 'wooden' at any point, but it often lacks the 'zing' that we've come to expect from a director such as Whedon. The character of Malcolm Reynolds is most obviously lacking, and has lost the trademark cynicism and somewhat self-effacing humor so prevalent in the television series. This time around, he plays 'brooding hero' to an uncomfortable extreme, which really drags things down when relating to the other characters.'Firefly' was, at its heart, a western, and this was reflected in the musical score. Snappy fiddles, warm guitars and some pipes and drums set the mood in a very non-intrusive way. 'Serenity', however, comes away lacking, with the only recognizable music being the 'Firefly' theme, played on guitar during the closing credits.Plot-wise, it's got some good points, but it's really nothing extremely new. Coupled with the sluggish pace of the movie, it serves its purpose, but really never gets around to resolving anything (Who is Shepherd Book, and what is his past? Who is Inara, and what is *her* story?), and, unfortunately, struggles and ultimately fails to avoid some rather time-worn clichés.If you're a die-hard 'Browncoat', feel free to buy it, or rent it, for the nostalgia factor. Otherwise, you're only going to end up confused and bewildered by the unfamiliar characters, and the sluggish and somewhat muddled plot.",Serenity
776,reeder-29,"A solid movie adaption of the TV series, accessible to new viewers",8,5 October 2005,"Serenity takes the characters and situations in the TV series Firefly, with a few tweaks such as Shepherd Book and Inara having left the ship to follow their careers, and puts them through a two hour adventure with more explosions than usual. The pace is also faster than a typical TV episode; the characters are given much less time to contemplate their situation. As the focus is on action, this is not a big problem. As in Firefly, most of the tension between characters comes from their different approaches to the adventure challenges they are confronted with. There appears to be adequate exposition to make the movie accessible to viewers who haven't seen any of the TV series, but certainly long-time viewers will appreciate more such things as the romances between Simon and Kaylee, and Mal and Inara.As you might expect, the crisis is more dire than usual, the villain more focused on committing evil. I found this made him a less believable character than the honest if misguided soldiers of the Alliance and greedy black market operators of the TV series.It's very nice to have an SF movie to go with the SF TV series, which you can take seriously.",Serenity
777,siholtuk,Hugely enjoyable - Restores my faith in film.,10,17 October 2005,"Probably the best sci-fi film I've seen in years. What I liked about it:1: No Hollywood blockbuster credits - in fact, hardly any intro / titles at all, just straight into the film.2: No SCREAMINGLY LOUD SOUNDTRACK - large sections with no music at all, or at least more appropriate material. 3: Top quality fx, but without being overwhelming to the point of being the main focus of the shot. 4: Top quality story line, without characters feeling the need to explain plot details in excruciating detail for the benefit of the mentally challenged. 5: Characters with real differences and not all American grown-up mall rats 6: Great little ""believeable"" touches throughout, like the plastic dinosaurs stuck to the pilots chair and stencils round the galley doors etc.And, just when you might have thought that the ending was building up for a bit of a LOUD Hollywood ending, the bit of the ship coming loose and ""hitting"" the camera with someone saying ""What was that?"" finished it off a treat.Not having seen Firefly didn't seem to make any difference to me; the story stood on it's own, and although there were a lot of hints about background action, I just took them as being hooks that were there for the audience members with a brain and imagination. I'd now rather like to see the series!",Serenity
778,tcc-6,Poor quality film from poor quality television,4,14 November 2005,"Everything in this picture has been done before. It is clichéd and weak. Whedon serves up the same stuff he's put on TV for years. There is no originality, no innovation, no drive to make a great film. There is only a childish raging against the networks and, by extension, the audience who rejected his work.Serenity leaves me feeling bored and tired. It is very quotable, but it lacks substance. The space western was done to death in the seventies, while later revivals have fallen flat. The film is schizophrenic, not sure what it is of what it is meant to be doing. Is it space opera? Yes it is, but it is poor space opera. It feels as though someone has cloned Star Wars, but has lost the heart of it.Rent this movie on a wet Sunday afternoon when there is not much on. Don't waste a your money of the cinema ticket.",Serenity

He forces us to fall in love with all of the characters in any world he whips up and then puts them in compromising positions to test them and more importantly, us.Serenity is no different. As a huge fan of the TV show ""Firefly"", I was more than excited to see that he was adapting it to the big screen, especially since the show lasted only six episodes. Joss Whedon kept the same humor, characterization, and feeling in the movie that the show had. This is truly one of the best movie adaptations made from a TV show. I guess he has a knack for it, though, since he adapted his flopped movie, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and adapted it for TV! If you are a fan of Firefly, do not miss Serenity.",Serenity

This is one of my favourite films and i am mad about it! If you like action/sci-fi films you should definitely see this. Nathan Fillion is great as the Captain and all the others are cool especially Jayne, a classic character that if i was in favour of spin offs should surely deserve one!

781,nikitar,how you can make a bad movie out of a good series,6,15 December 2008,"I never thought it's possible, but they did it. The whole movie, from start to end, is an encyclopedia of Hollywood clichés. Brutal reavers' attack to impress viewer right off, uber-hacker processing zizabytes of information by one motion of his finger, a hero dying on the hands of his captain at the exact second when medic arrives, a scientist recorded a deadly warning right before being eaten up by the monsters and of course high-school girl turning out to be a natural born killer and dealing with dozens of armed men without any visible efforts.The one thing I like about the original series is that it's natural and rather believable. Nine different people, each with his/her own quirks, are standing against coldness of the universe. But in the movie we see no genuine human interaction at all, it's all concocted from action scenes and clichés.I've seen worse movies, that's true, but this one is my bigger disappointment so far.",Serenity
782,TheTSArt-1,The Audience Clapped,10,1 October 2005,"I can probably count on one hand the number of movies I have seen where at the end the audience clapped. Serenity was one of those.With so many movies falling into a cookie cutter mold, it's so refreshing to see a movie that is as close to being 'original' as is possible. Where so many movies deal with black-and-white, good-and-badSerenity deals with many shades of grey, which I believe in the end is more relatable and delivers drama on a much more powerful scale.There are moments that will make you jump and ones that will make you cryand some of the best one-liners you may ever hear. The fight scenes and space battles are simply amazing with new types of action that I'm sure other movies will soon try to replicate.I only saw one episode of the TV show, long after it had been canceled, so I didn't really consider myself a fan until tonight. I'm going again tomorrow.",Serenity

The action sequences are well spaced, never to boring and never too action packed. Everything is well timed, and several scenes will leave you speechless. I totally recommend this movie, & I hope they'll be a sequel, because the director Joss Whedon has mentioned such.",Serenity

There's plenty of prelude to establish the back-story with some really nice narrative devices.

My fiancé and I left the theater scratching our heads wondering why everyone in the audience was guffawing at all the lame, predictable jokes. In the end we chalked it up to low IQs.Everything about this movie was derivative. You folks who are comparing it to the first time you saw Star Wars--which was actually original and groundbreaking-- must be suffering from exposure to toxins yourselves. Whole scenes were lifted straight from Star Wars! And the dopey dialog-- I rolled my eyes so often I got a headache.If I'd seen this on SciFi channel or the WB, I might've been satisfied by it.

I thought I liked Star Wars but compared to this it's just empty headed nonsense. Right from the brilliant opening sequences, which were bursting with creativity, through to the stirring and thought provoking finale, this was a feast for the eyes, the mind and the heart. On top of that it even has a wicked sense of humour which makes us love the characters all the more. The direction is fantastic (can't believe this guy was responsible for Buffy and Angel!) and the camera style is particularly outstanding, bringing us as up close and personal to the characters and the action as we possibly could be. And what characters they are, real people we can recognise inspite of the backdrop of interplanetary strife. Needless to say then the acting is also superb from a cast of little-knowns who simply demand notice after this display. Not only an instant sci-fi classic but an instant cinema classic, bring on a sequel.",Serenity
787,fritzofgalatia,Excellent: Both as a Firefly Fan and as a Normal Viewer,10,20 October 2005,"I have a rather unique view point on Serenity. You see, I work at a movie theater as a projectionist. Normally, my theater would not have gotten Serenity because our company owns two theaters in the area and movies are split between the theaters. My theaters is the ""art"" theater. However, we are also the ones who show open caption prints. When the open caption print of Serenity came, I had no clue what it was other than a sci-fi movie. Now as a rule I like sci-fi, but with the Star Wars pre-trilogy I've gotten somewhat of a skeptical toward it lately.So during one of my shifts, I took a few minutes out to watch this movie. What I saw was actually fairly good. I found the dialogue to be witty and funny and the action fairly well done. So this in mind, I decided to sit down and watch the entire film before we lost the print (our theater only usually holds open caption prints for two days). When I did, I was blow away. Whedon's dialogue in Serenity is exactly what Star Wars was missing. In recent Star Wars movies, dialogue was always there just to fill in gaps between fight scenes and to explain just what the hell was going on. In Serenity, the characters talk just to talk. This adds a whole new depth to the character development that I have been greatly wanting from sci-fi for a long time.The movie is an absolute roller coaster ride of emotions. One minute you're laugh your butt off, the next you're on the verge of crying, the next you're tight with tension. The development of characters and their interaction with each other was way above par and simply overloaded the expectation I had going in.So after I had seen Serenity and found out that it was the continuation a canceled TV series, I made it was point to find out more. Now I had never heard of Firefly before Serenity came out, but luckily I had a few friends that had, and even owned the DVD set. I borrowed it from them and watched the series with my mother and father. Now it's one thing for me to sit down and watch 12 episodes of a TV series in a row. I can have my lazy days. However, where my PARENTS sit down and watch those 12 episode with me, you know it has to be good! Actually the only thing that stopped us from watching all 15 in one day was the fact that I had accidentally left the last DVD at my friends' house! Well, needless to say I was utterly and totally taken by this cult TV series.I resolved to go back and see the movie again (this time knowing the back story) and made sure to bring a friend. Again, even though I knew what was coming, I loved the movie. The characters progress and grew and the storyline of Firefly was advanced. This is what is driving me crazy about Lost right now: the story line is not advancing. Serenity clearly and definitely moved the storyline forward, and I am dying for more! As a side note (oh and *SPOILER*) I was not every sad when Wash died, but once I had seen Firefly, I was horrified that they killed such as wonderful character off!",Serenity
788,DarrenDirt,"faithful to Series, but entertaining enough on its own even for Alliance loyalists",10,2 October 2005,"A friend of mine, usually very wordy, posted this simple review on an online forum: ""Just saw it. Terrific. Very few flaws.""The only flaw I encountered was a bad sound mix, some echoing in important in-ship dialogue scenes.But, that said...GO SEE THIS GORRAM MOVIE!10 out of 10. ""One thumb up"". Way up. Seriously, the intro for it explains the back story and characters BEAUTIFULLY (for those not familiar, yet isn't boring at all for Browncoats), the action is amazing, there's still no sound in space (except when they're in the atmo), the writing is tight and stays true to the series, the dialogue is in character and LOL funny many times, and overall it is even just simply entertaining film-making enjoyable for n00bs and perhaps even the Alliance faithful. An unbelievably fun ride, it starts at the word ""Go"" and a countless number of surprising plot turns later, you're still left with a few surprises even for those who know what Joss has done in his 3 TV series.One thing I was ecstatic to witness: The ""freedom"" message is WAY more direct in the movie than in ANY of the TV episodes -- the opening narrative is like Joss is screaming ""It is wrong to control other people and tell them how to live/act/think!"" I couldn't believe it. It was worth paying $10.00 just to hear the words go out during that first 5 minutes.So stop reading my words right now, and go help the opening box office. Seriously, go see it. Now. Today.

From the music to the humor to the synergy of these characters I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. I so enjoyed the characters that I am disappointed I Can't find out more of them. This needs a sequel. The studios need to have more writers direct, the dialogue was so snappy and quick and smart that t almost rolled up and over the edge, but just backed off when I thought I was laughing just a bit too much.

790,mwilson0217,10 Times better than even I expected,10,10 October 2005,"I finally went to see Serenity this weekend. Now I have to admit I am a huge fan of Joss Whedon. I came into Firefly only after getting the DVD's for X-mas. I asked for them because I knew a movie was coming out soon. I watched the first episode and was hooked. I then hooked my husband, my daughter, my sister, her husband, his best friend. I mean this show just ropes you in. Serenity the movie was 10 times better than I was even expecting. I was so impressed by the way it answered so many questions from the TV show that were left hanging. A warning however to anyone wanting to bring young children. The movie is rated PG-13 for a reason, it's violent and there are some graphic scenes. I was expecting it and was surprised to see so many young children (8 and under)in the theater. I think a lot of people who never saw the show were expecting something along the lines of Star Wars. This is different and better in so many ways. If you haven't seen it yet, Go!",Serenity
791,WikusVanDeMerwe,This is how we should define 'a good movie',9,30 September 2005,"I just got back from the theatre, and am still thinking about the movie. The future plots, the histories, the fate of this person or that person....the whole universe is entrancing. I think somebody commented about the awe evoked whenever Star Wars first came out on screen. I wasn't alive back then, but have had such feelings when watching and reading the Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion or the Star Wars trilogies. There was a pilot show called ""Firefly"" on the Sci-Fi network a year or two ago, and I only was able to see the first episode. I didn't get to see any of the following episodes, but was hooked on the idea. I hadn't given it any thought or recognition until just yesterday whenever I found at that THIS movie was the same universe and ship and crew from that one episode of a show that got cancelled. The universe simply surrounds viewers of this movie, and takes you in without giving the slightest hint of being overblown or trite.Simply put, this is really a ""new"" Star Wars, in that it all is very unique, believable (as in it all works within itself) (well, the first trilogy was believable), and full of history. The ""Used Universe"" isn't a banal concept, it has just been misused over the years. And now we get to experience good film-making just as we did for the original Star Wars trilogy or the Lord of the Rings (book and films). This has everything that we could want from a movie: humor, intriguing and engaging plots, rounded, human characters, fine acting, engaging music, action, conflict, and again, great characters. If the elf is Tolkien's greatest creation, then one of the creatures of this universe is Whedon's foulest. I won't go into detail. You have to go see this movie for yourself!Suspense and plot arcs are very well handled, and the action is very tight and fitting. The actors and their characters play out very nicely, and you get to know pretty much everyone in this movie. It's a sign of good writing when we make our winces or grunts or sobs. I don't think many people will be disappointed with this. It's a well-rounded and engaging film, and feeds off of its own interesting intricacies, much like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings before it. This is how we should define ""a good movie.""",Serenity
792,strikef,Firefly is dead...but Serenity rises from the ashes,10,1 October 2005,"Those fans coming into Serenity expecting a 90 minute long uber-episode will have their expectations dashed to ribbons in the first five minutes. This is NOT a Firefly episode. Rather, it is something more. Bigger. Better. Stronger and more mature. It comes into the world as a plucky teenager, innocent but with interesting edges of darkness and suspense. When you are done watching it, you will bare witness to a beautiful creature comprised of blown away expectations, sadness, all seven Deadly Sins, and extreme, angry beauty.All that aside, you will be blown away.Going into the movie, I knew two things from accidental spoilers dropped from interviews and other reviews: That a main character would die (my bets were on Wash or Zoe, due to the heartstring-tugging potential of EITHER of their deaths) and that Mal would be one of the greatest things to happen to Hollywood. Despite my accurate foretelling of the first point...it is done well. It is done heartbreakingly well...and those emotions will be the reward for long time Firefly fans who have seen all the characters develop for 14 episodes instead of an hour of rushed movie-going time. ALL the characters shine, but Mal in particular plays off of the entire cast very well. The Operative is amazing and shockingly good at being bad. While River, the main focus of the movie, is very cool and spooky and action-hero-ish, her 'amazing' talents never overshadow the subtle perfection of the other characters. I got more out of the mind-twist fragments of her visions and her dreams than of her impressive-but-generic fight sequences. While the introduction of the Reavers was a semi-let-down to me...coming across more like 'Mad Max' and '28 Days Later rejects', I must admit, the idea of them, and the 'race' as a whole fulfilled their role perfectly.Finally, I'd like to say that the special effects were very nice. I've heard mixed reviews about the CGI and the effects from several reviewers. I did not, for one moment, feel as if I was not drawn into the world presented for me. It may not have been on the ""Star Wars Ep III"" level of CGI...but maybe that's what made it better. That they still use scale models mixed in with the CGI makes a BIG difference in a movie designed to depict dirty, rough-and-tumble ships. Only one or two of the 'cityscaps' made me think: ""Oh, wait, that's not real"".Go and watch this movie. Better yet, watch Firefly first. Then you'll get the full effect. It's still amazing as a stand-alone movie....better than 95% of the 'awesome Sci-Fi' that Hollywood force-feeds us to watch these days.Watching it with both eyes open, however....it will completely blow you away. Do yourself a favour and grab the $20 DVD set first.I suspect this movie will have a second Opening Weekend...once all the people who hadn't watched Firefly finally watch it...then come back to watch Serenity again.",Serenity

I watched with a group of people from 4 to 65 and some had watched and some hadn't. We ALL loved it. In fact, those who hadn't seen the TV show were asking to borrow the DVDs as we left. The characters were true to the TV show yet you grasped their appeal in 119 minutes. If this is an example BRING ON THE Sequels. PLEASE. Mal was his true cocky, lovable and gruff self. They did not play up the relationship between Wash and Zop as much as they could have but you are limited on time. The doctor was much more forceful and Kaylee adorable as ever. The Shepard only made a brief appearance but it was significant. At first I was worried that Inarra was left out but she quickly showed up as a lure for the crew.

I feel that those who never saw the show, could go into the theater and have a terrific time.There were moments where I felt a non-fan wouldn't feel the full gist of a scene because those who were not fans of the show didn't have as much time as we did to care about the characters.All in all I had a great time. I felt Joss has made his mark and I look forward to seeing the numbers climb. I do know that I will be going again, taking the kids, and I think they'll have a great time as well.Certainly I can say that the story was A) well-written, B) superbly acted, C)well choreographed, D) had wonderful special effects.

798,kingsx25213,"An excellent mix of action, humor and drama",9,3 October 2005,"Firefly fans will not be disappointed by Joss Whedon's first venture to the big screen, and newcomers will likely fall in love with it as well if given a chance. When Fox pulled the plug on Firefly three years ago I figured that was the last we'd ever see of Serenity and her crew. But persistence from the fans and Joss Whedon himself has resulted in one of the most entertaining movies of 2005. In a year when movie quality has been largely put on the back burner, Serenity delivers the goods. It isn't a film that will change the world, but it is everything it promises to be: a rip-roaring sci fi actioner with plenty of excitement, drama, comedy and, for Firefly fans, a sense of closure. Joss pulled off an amazing feat when making this movie by coming up with a story that is accessible to everyone, not just Firefly fans. You really don't have to have any prior knowledge of the series to enjoy this movie. And enjoy it you will, if you decide to go see it. Every newbee I have spoken to had a great time with this film, and most walked away with a desire to see the old Firefly episodes as well. For fans and non-fans alike, this is definitely worth a look.",Serenity
799,ellie-68,Serenity - A surprising film,9,9 October 2005,"I have never seen Firefly. However a couple of friends of my boyfriend had recommended that he drag me along to see this film. I am a Sci-fi fan but am quite particular about the type of films of this genre i go to see and to be perfectly honest with you i went along to the cinema with no expectations whatsoever.Boy was i surprised! Joss Whedon has created a little Gem here. I'm sure he would not thank fans of the film for comparing it to his other work as it is in many ways very different...however the Joss Whedon way of doing things can be seen here. Firstly the humour is excellently placed. This film is not intentionally a comedy and does not come across that way either but at times it is incredibly funny. Fans of the humour in both Buffy and Angel will see it's head poking through the clouds at apt and well placed points. Secondly the action is there. Joss really gets stuck into the fighting scenes in this film (a special mention at this point for Summer Glau who plays River - Her fight scenes were mind blowing!)and when he is not restrained by the need to put a fighting double in place he really does go all out.The character development is also worth a mention. You quickly become attached to the characters. Chiwetel Ejiofor was incredible as the operative. The honesty and calm he brought to such a violent role makes his performance highly notable.I cant recommend this film enough. It has everything. Humour, storyline, action, great special effects and leaves you with the feeling that Serenity should not just be a stand alone film. The potential for great things in sequels is definitely there and i for one would not mind being dragged along to the movies to watch this film or any subsequent serenity films again. The IMDb ratings given to this film by it's fans say it all. Miss this at your peril!",Serenity
800,ccoshow-1,Not exactly like the TV show; judge it on its own merit.,9,12 August 2005,"***NO SPOILERS*** I saw the movie at a sneak preview in Houston, TX on 6/23/05. I was just happy that we were getting more of these characters and this setting.Visually, it was stunning. The extra budget for effects was well spent. The characters and their relationships were recognizable, but there had been changes from the show. I think this was necessary within the movie, and part of an evolution from the TV show to the big screen (the movie takes place 6 months after the last episode, ""Objects in Space""). Things have changed.There is a higher action and violence level in this (duh, it's a movie, not on TV), and we get some major revelations about the world (which some who saw it with me already don't like). There are some MAJOR events that affect the characters, and I wasn't totally happy with them - shocked is the word. But this is Joss's world, and his characters, and he tells the stories he wants to tell. He doesn't get bound up in hurting our feelings; he just tells it like it is. I believe he did say that this was the hardest thing he'd ever had to write.At least one person at our screening was a ""Firefly virgin,"" and he said that he liked it. I hope people who have no exposure to the show will be able to see this and enjoy it. Our big damn heroes come across well, and I hope this will get them some well-deserved exposure. This is a no-holds barred, big-time action/adventure sci-fi story, bold and raw, and set in a world unlike anything portrayed in SF before (well, except for ""Firefly""). And I hope it does really, really well, and we get to see the sequels.",Serenity
801,bubwaller,A wonderful gift to Firefly fans--and to non-fans as well!,10,1 October 2005,"As a Joss Whedon fan, I looked forward to Firefly when it was first televised--and just couldn't stay with it. Whether it was the network starting with the non-pilot episode, the jumping around of the viewing schedule, or whatever, I thought it was just a misfire and stopped watching. Thank goodness I watched the DVDs, and became entranced with this new wondrous Whedon world. The series didn't have a chance to answer some of the mysteries it presented, and this movie does a beautiful job of weaving together all the elements to leave me feeling like I've just received a grand gift. The whole movie theater broke into applause at the end of the movie--and that included some non-Firefly fans who could obviously appreciate the great action and writing. What a wonderful ending to the previously sad tale of how badly the network handled this series.",Serenity
802,sadie-darling,Go see this! Or you WILL regret it...,10,6 October 2005,"Luvvie Jonathan Ross, quoted as saying ""if the latest three Star Wars had been a third as good as Serenity..."" was the most persuasive element in the choice of whether or not to attend the premiere in the UK last night. And I have to say I was not disappointed.Yeah, I've seen and loved 'Firefly', but I was distracted by bad news on the day before the premiere and may not have gone if it hadn't been for the passion for 'Serenity' displayed by the fan site www.cantstopthesignal.co.uk, or Mr. Ross' excellent review on Film 2005.An excellent beginning sequence introduces you to the background of 'Firefly' meaning that those with no knowledge of the television series (so unfortunately cancelled by Fox in the States) have the ability to catch up, without being drawn away from the essence and excitement of the movie. The characters are just as lovable and interesting as the plot is extensive and involving... if you see one movie this year, ensure that you part with cash to see 'Serenity'. Or you WILL regret it.",Serenity
803,whiplash4ever-1,From TV to the Silver Screen,10,21 January 2007,"Based on a TV series called Firefly, I'm not sure what it is about this movie. I can't quite put my finger on it. All I know is I love it. I'm not even sure if it's a B movie or not. Regardless, the special effects are phenomenal. The acting is phenomenal. The story is phenomenal. It's been a long time since I came across a movie on cable that I missed in the theater which I absolutely fell in love with. There are several people in this film that you may recognize (Alan Tudyk, Ron Glass, Chiwetel Ejiofor) from other projects, but the only true Hollywood notable is Adam Baldwin, and because of that, the characters are extremely believable. Personally, I gave this film a 10 for originality and quality. Of course, that's just my opinion... I could be wrong.Whip",Serenity
804,thevampyro,A Brilliant Sci-Fi,10,10 November 2005,"SERENITY Warning: Contains mild spoilersThree years ago, Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy and Angel brought his extraordinary vision of the future to television. The show is set approximately 500 years in the future where an expansion of the human race outwards to the farthest frontiers of outer space. Firefly tells the story of a group of rebels living in space. To partially understand the story, a galactic civil war called the Unification War took place in which Mal Reynolds fought for the losing side. The Independent regions want freedom but The Alliance demands to rule these colonies thus results a war. The movie starts off with a shot of planet Earth and a very well done narration telling the history of terraforming, colonization, and the structure of the inter-planetary government. Earth could no longer sustain our numbers but people found another solar system with dozens of planets and hundreds of moons where they start a new life. Those who hasn't seen Firefly will can easily pick up the story from here.Mal leads a small crew who are the closest thing he has left to family: his second-in-command Zoë; Wash the pilot; the mercenary Jayne, and ship's mechanic Kaylee. They take on any jobs, legal or otherwise, just to keep the ship up and running. The crew gets caught in crossfire when they welcome aboard two mysterious passengers, Simon and River (as shown in the pilot episode of Firefly). To make matters worse, it turns out that The Alliance were doing all sort of experiments on River, tapping her brain to see what's inside. Her brother, Simon, a man who sacrifices his promising future as a doctor, infiltrates the lab and frees River from captivity. Along the way, another threat emerges. The Reavers are savages who roam the infinite space causing chaos and destruction to the weak and powerless. The Reavers are said to have gone mad from the isolation. Their mode of operation tends to be raping their victims to death, cannibalizing them, and using the remaining skin as clothing. Near the beginning, the crew pulls off a crime but quickly interrupted by Reavers in the vicinity.It didn't long for the Alliance to sent out a trained assassin called The Operative to try and reacquire River Tam. She became important to the Alliance because they fear that their secrets maybe revealed due to River's psychic abilities. At one point, the team stopped at a bar to do business but River shows up, starts a brawl, and beats up everyone in her path. Because of the state of the art technology, The Alliance eventually finds the ship and crew they're in. The Operative takes a little visit to Inara's place and Mal later shows up to rescue her. A clash between our hero and the main villain takes place here. Very awesome fight scene I might add. OK. I think I've said enough. All and all, this is a must see movie of the year whether you're a Browncoat or not. The fight scenes just plain rocks! The cinematography and special effects are terrific. The direction is masterfully well done. You gotta love the dialogue and storyline. Some great one-liners too. This movie will take your breathe away. Finally, a movie that will make you forget Revenge of the Sith. Outstanding big-screen debut for Joss Whedon. ""Two Thumbs Way Up!""",Serenity
805,robert-spears,Outstanding,10,7 October 2005,"One of the best movies I've seen this year. Period. Anyone can watch this movie; science fiction fans, chick flick fans, or action hero fans. This movie was well thought out and never paused. The characters are rich and well defined without spending 45 minutes of development. It was also refreshing to see a movie (sci-fi or not) take on a multi-dimensional plot. Not to mention, introducing an antagonist that relies on his mind more than his braun. This movie left me wanting to take the time to catch up on the TV series it is based on. Bottom line, this movie fluid and graceful; humorous without trying to be campy. And while there aren't any big dollar actors in the movie, and multi-million dollar special effects, everything about this movie seems real and believable. This may be this first movie in a long time that movie goers will see more than once.",Serenity
806,jandaba,Definitely worth seeing. Once.,7,13 November 2005,"First of all, I declare not having seen the ""Firefly"" series. :) My bad. I'm saying this because it seems that there's more talk about that series, rather than about the actual movie, and this leaves an impression that seeing the movie without having seen the series is a waste of time. Well, it's not.There's only one thing that should not be mistaken about this movie: one should not expect something clever, worth a lot of attention and so forth. The movie, in my opinion, is of a rather simple, nonetheless entertaining style, and it fulfills its purpose without much help from the viewer - all you have to do is watch. This is an absolutely different breed of movies, which are rather trivial, but are good for relaxation, leisure or entertainment or whatever. Nothing serious, however.And one more thing: I did find the plot a bit underdeveloped. However, it may be because I am not familiar with the whole series of a prequel, ""Firefly"". But if you take the movie as an independent piece, there most definitely is something missing. Not that something is not clear - on the contrary, everything you need to know becomes clear by the end, it's just that by the end of the movie, I had an involuntary comment that sounded something like ""all this fuss, for what??"" It seems like the whole thing is no big deal. Maybe it's the characters overacting, or the plot being underdeveloped, the abundance of cheesy moments and clichés or simply my ignorance of ""Firefly"". Whatever the reason, a certain combination of shortcomings gives this movie a flavor of underdevelopment, which is characteristic of all American movies, especially those spawned in the 21st.",Serenity
807,kdbtd,My favorite movie,10,15 October 2019,"I know some of you skeptics might immediately think that a 10/10 reviewer should be dismissed as a fanboy, but here's why I think Serenity remains memorable and relevant 14 years after it was made. In simple terms, excellent casting and character development. If you only just read a summary of the plot on paper, it wouldn't sound like anything too unique. But what I found is that there is something likeable and memorable about every personality in this movie. As you watch the brilliance of Summer Glau, Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, and the others act out their roles on screen, you will be hooked. In my mind, I find a benchmark of good storytelling is when you can make me care and start hoping for certain outcomes for the characters, then that kind of visceral emotion is what makes for a compelling, enjoyable film with great replay value. In a genre where enormous big budgets and special effects often make just telling a great human story the second priority, Serenity delivers big in this area, and does so gracefully with a very small, limited budget by comparison.Some ask, is the movie enjoyable as a standalone cinematic experience without watching firefly? I can honestly say the answer is yes, however you will appreciate it more if you do watch the Firefly TV series. I watched the movie first, then went back and watched the series. As a standalone film, I would rate it more as only 8/10, but I found I appreciated it far more after watching the series. So, as an element in the Firefly universe, I think it rightfully deserves a higher score. As many have lamented, Firefly only ran one season for fourteen episodes, back all the way in 2002. It is even more doubtful that there will ever be a sequel to Serenity now that so much time has passed, as the door was left wide open to develop the story even further. But hey, we can all hope, right?",Serenity
808,triquentra,Well Balanced Action at its best,10,30 September 2005,"I'm not a die hard Firefly fan, I haven't seen all the episodes, and though I adore Joss for most of the Buffys I've seen, I still remember too many Angels to be his biggest fan. That said.... I ADORED THIS MOVIE! I have not had so much fun with my but squashed into an uncomfortable chair since Return of the Jedi (I was four, and much more prone to spontaneous fun). There is usually some qualifier, too much blood, too much talking, too cheesy, too irreverent, too serious, too fluffy, weak female characters, sleazy male characters, or the theatrical kiss of death, ""It had its moments."" But this was as close to a perfect action movie that I have seen. It balanced fast-paced flying, raucous ass-kicking, with heart felt poignancy and out and out riotous guffaws. All with in and INTELLIGENT script, in depth characterization and Sci-Fi eye candy at it best. I heartily suggest that this is THE MOVIE to see this year, forget the Oscar contenders, the franchised blockbusters and give yourself the gift of SERENITY.",Serenity

The movie kept fans in awe, and waiting for the new season that is rumored to be being released in the next couple of years. so Joss Whedon does it again in creating another cult classic that anyone can enjoy. And i implore anyone who goes to see the movie and enjoys it, to go find firefly and watch the season and go see it again...",Serenity
810,talesontone,A Blast! (minor spoilers),8,1 October 2005,"Some friends who hadn't seen the TV show went and they had a blast. Serenity isn't perfect but it is still very good entertainment and has better characterization than most recent similar types of Movies. Fans of the Sci-Fi genre and people looking for a breezy fun action movie should be able to jump right in and enjoy even so. There are rough edges and parts that new people won't get. This is relatively minor stuff and should be fine for the majority who will be rocked by the ups and downs in action and story and only highly objectionable by the real nit-pickers.The show and movie have cheesy elements which some will find endearing and others obnoxious. I loved the movie so I think you know which camp I fall under.Joss had to do some balancing and had to take some risks. IMHO I think they mostly work. He'll PO a small cross section of the fans with some of his decisions and gain many new fans as well to help keep the machine rolling (hopefully). Eventually, the majority of the disgruntled fans will come around and see the beauty of what he's done. Some of the show's characters had to get short shrift this time out in order to serve the greater good of a tight story and pacing. Should the series go on (a good chance) this disparity can be evened out and there are already major plot points on the horizon for Inarra and Books past will still cast a long shadow on the series, mark my words.People who haven't seen the show should watch at least the pilot and the very last episode on the DVD set (Objects in Space)and will be more rewarded by their understanding of the inter-crew politics and relationships. The Operative from the movie and the Bounty Hunter from the last episode are well drawn bad guys that are very 3 dimensional and help add to a sense of real menace. They aren't the same character but share more than a few commonalities. I hope that if the series goes on, that we see the Bounty Hunter Jubal Early again at least once. It doesn't seem likely that we will see the Operative again but if we did, I think it would be great. Who knows? Maybe he won't intend to cross their path again but have it happen unintentionally. Should this happen I would wage it would likely be for a purpose that would put them on the same side instead of in adversarial positions. In Joss's storytelling, unintended happenings are more the norm than the exception and there are many delightful and dreadful reversals of fortune to keep you guessing.",Serenity
811,anon-76,The biggest load of rubbish I have ever seen!!!,1,14 October 2005,"Twice I have tried to see the film at the cinema, and twice I have fallen asleep in the middle of the film. It is mind-numbingly boring, sufficiently boring enough to have you going ""zzzzzzzzz....."" in the middle of the film. The acting is wooden, the storyline not very believable either and the actors / actresses being not that great too. If the networks axed Whedon's ""Firefly"" (or whatever) television series, surely that says something about the whole project and the whole concept. I have just been watching some late-night entertainment news programme, and in it, SERENITY was labelled as an action-Western type film. One common theme about all Westerns is that they are all invariably boring. The only good ones were ""A Fistful Of Dollars"", ""The Good, The Bad & The Ugly"", ""A Few Dollars More"", i.e. ones with Clint Eastwood in them - Clint Eastwood is a REAL STAR!!! If Joss Whedon had gone with a few well-known faces who appear to be suitable for the Western genre (i.e. Hugh Jackman, Harrison Ford, etc.), i.e. with rugged masculine faces who have seen a bit of experience, instead of a cast of unknowns, SERENITY would have been better received maybe.",Serenity
812,ercanaday,Excellent!,10,12 September 2006,"I have just watched this movie again on HBO and I still love it! I loved the series and was sad to see it canceled. I really enjoy everything about it - the witty word play, the drama, and the dysfunctional ""family"" of characters. These characters have such heart. The scenery, the music, the dialog, the attention to detail just impress me beyond what I can describe. I have gotten attached to several TV series in the past but this is the first one that I have ever bought on DVD so that I can watch it over and over again. The movie brought some closure to the series but I would like to see it continued.",Serenity
813,tedthespankmonkey,The Star Wars of today!,10,14 October 2005,"I'm an admitted Joss Whedon fan, though I clearly recognize that not everything he does is great -- he occasionally sucks. I didn't get the chance to see Firefly when it was on Fox, so I went into this movie not knowing anything really about these characters or where they came from.But that didn't matter once it started. Joss' ability to write fleshed out characters is uncanny. Any character on screen for any amount of time, you know right away who they are. With just a few words, you're able to understand them. I'm not surprised when I see movies very much; once you understand basic structures of scripts and genre conventions, not much catches you off-guard. Serenity caught me off-guard many times. It's full of excitement, adventure, drama, tragedy, action, humor -- anything you could want in a movie is in Serenity. It's a tragedy that it did not do anything at the box office.I won't ruin the experience for you if you haven't seen it, but the best way to give it a 'blurb' is this: This movie is the Star Wars (the originals, not the prequels) of today. This movie is what everyone wanted the prequels to be! It echoes all the perfect archetypes. It's about a band of rag-tag rebels who become the object of a galactic war and must overcome impossible odds not to triumph and be the heroes, but to do what is right. It's been a long time since I've sat in the theater in pure delight (without having to turn a blind eye to badly done aspects), but delight was what I experienced for the two hours I sat watching Serenity.If you love Star Wars, if you love Sci-Fi, if you don't love Star Wars, if you don't love Sci-Fi, if you just love great movies, GO SEE SERENITY. I can't say enough about this movie and do it justice. Just go see it and give it a chance. The best movie I have seen this year.",Serenity

A fast-paced plot, witty dialogue and Joss Whedon's inherent playfulness ensure this movie stands out in it's genre. I really enjoyed it. Summer Glau is intriguing! The team of characters create an instant rapport that reminded me why the star trek brands engage the audience. I hope the Firefly series is now dusted off the shelf and given another chance as the potential to build on this brand must now be huge. Above all however it's the bold style of this movie that gives the genre a hard, much needed kick up the backside.",Serenity
815,trogwolf,Sci Fi of the quality of The Day the Earth Stood Still - a CLASSIC,10,18 October 2005,"This film should win an Oscar for editing at the very least. This film has a tremendous story, excellent character portrayal, great visual effects, and even if you can't see the antagonist's point of view, you can respect him for his conviction. Destined to become a classic on the order of The Day the Earth Stood Still. I really liked the Films ""Dark Planet"", ""Pitch Black"", and ""Chronicles of Riddick"" (a terrific Conan story set in space); but Serenity far exceeds these films. the only bad thing, is that by saying all of this, I run the risk of building your expectations so high, that you don't enjoy the film as much as I did. What I liked best about this film, is that relatively unknown actors were able to make this such a tremendous overall success as a piece of film-making. It's always fun to see your favorite stars in any film, but you know a film is good when it launches new stars.",Serenity
816,Jeice,Excellent Movie.,10,21 March 2006,"My friends told me of this movie and told me how it was based off a short lived TV series that Fox canceled. So I'm going to see this movie with them with the thought that it was going to be a piece of crap.I was dead wrong.The plot doesn't require that you saw the series but it helps a little. The crew's sort of predicament in jobs reminded me of ""Outlaw Star"" but it still seemed original in the way Whedon presented it. And his view of the future and the sort of anti-heroes that lived in it was so intriguing that I bought the series and watched it just to see more.I loved the characters. Jayne, the hot-headed ""muscle"" of the ship was so funny. Kaylee's sweetness and innocent and yet sort of ""pervertedness"" was much more than amusing. Zoe's loyalty and formality with the Captain and yet her love of Wash were perfectly balanced. Simon's formal view on himself and how he should acted conflicted with his protection of his sister, River. And finally, my favorite character, Captain Malcom ""Mal"" Reynolds. The ever honorable yet sleazy leader. His quick wit only out done by his knack for the right orders. His genius in battle (not to mention all of his luck) is astounding. He is one of my favorite characters in any genre of movie, book, folk tale, or television shows to date.All in all, I love this movie.",Serenity

819,glx1969,It rocks!,9,26 April 2006,"Finally a science-fiction movie that doesn't get lost in a myriad of special effects. Although this movie is not perfect, it's very entertaining. In many sequences, my whole body was actually reacting to the action. It's pretty rare that this happens to me.Good action, good humor, sometimes dark. The costumes are interesting. The idea behind the movie is not completely new but still pretty interesting. One of the very good movies I've seen lately. (The others being Crash, V for Vendetta. Bloodrayne and Feed.) A must see for science-fiction or action movies fan.In a certain way, it reminds me of the star war series. Well, of course since there are battles that take place in space. River Tam, the character at the center of the plot, is pretty convincing. The way she looks, the way she moves, the way she speaks. Even the way she walks (barefoot with some kind of elegance). Nice casting, I'd say.The movie could have been made a little bit more realistic but it's entertaining science-fiction, not a NASA documentary... so I'm okay with it, overall.It also reminds me of Equilibrium, a movie that was about a central government doing everything possible to keep its population under control.Watch this movie with lots of bass. It will only add to your experience.",Serenity

Someone at Fox clearly didn't get it...but Joss Whedon didn't give up. Serenity is probably the best film of it's kind since the original Star Wars. It takes a Han Solo type character (Captain Mal), a rag-tag crew of petty but lovable criminals/rebels from ""the Outer Rim"" type territory (who just want to live life their way and in freedom), and pits them against a fascist core system that could be the Dick Cheney America of the future, personified by a cool but vicious Bounty Hunter. Oh, and yes....there be Reavers too, which are a big part of the story.The pacing, characters, writing and action is just great. Brilliant one-liners fly from left to right & back again, and the opening pre-credit sequence is the most effective, exciting and economical piece of exposition I have ever seen. It should be taught in film school.Let's hope they make enough money on the release in theaters and DVD to make the sequels",Serenity

I watched the first episode and was hooked instantly. I watched the whole series in less than two days and have seen it 6 time through now LOL...I an old Si-Fi fan of 35 years at least and very hard to please.

822,amill1,Excellent movie--just a few complaints.,10,6 February 2006,"This movie was excellent. I enjoyed it so much that I really cannot rate it lower than a 10. Easily best new movie I've seen in a long time. The story was good, it managed to surprise me a couple of times. The acting (except the noted performances below) was pretty good, the actions sequences were great, and the dialogue was very witty (though that was never a doubt with Joss Whedon writing). However, I really just need to gripe about a couple of things. Also, I will point out that I have yet to see the show (though I'm buying the DVD set now that I've seen the movie!)1. Kaylee -- I'm not sure if it was just the writing style for the character, or the actress, but she irritated me throughout the entire film. The writing, I think, was the main problem, but that style could have been pulled off successfully by a better actress. 2. Simon -- Not really sure what bugged me about him, but I just don't think I liked the character much. Definitely annoying. I feel as though he should have gotten less screen time, especially considering how little attention was paid to Wash. 3. The whole Kaylee/Simon dynamic. Again, I think it was just irritating because I really don't like either character, so scenes when it is just them in front of the camera served no purpose and added nothing to the movie for me. That's it for complaining. Again, excellent movie. Even with my annoyances, I had to give it a 10 because it really did deserve it. The hand-to-hand fight scenes and the space battles were among the best of either I have EVER seen in a movie! And the character of River was 100% great in every way possible.",Serenity
823,Claes_R,Great entertainment,8,15 January 2006,"I've seen many raving comments from fans of the TV series ""Firefly"" which this movie apparently is based on and figured one more balanced opinion from a non-fan would be of use to the IMDb community.As we are informed in the opening sequence, this movie is set in a future in which humanity has left this solar system for a new one, having many inhabitable worlds. As is revealed throughout the movie, a war has been fought in which ""The Alliance"" emerged victorious. However, a divide still exists between Alliance worlds and those who would prefer independence. There is also an esoteric force in the system: Reavers, a tribe of space-faring ""zombies"".The story picks up with the kidnapping of a girl from some military installation by her brother, the ship's doctor of starship ""Serenity"". We then follow the archetypal ragtag crew of ""Serenity"" as circumstances force them to take a stand against The Alliance.The plot is nicely paced, picking up momentum at a comfortable rate with just the right amount of action sequences for an entertaining evening. Visual effects, which I find important for a sci-fi movie, don't push the edge but are sufficiently immersive. However, what makes this movie a gem is the intelligent and witty dialog which is unusual for the genre. The delivery of some lines is priceless. Furthermore, the characters are instantly likable and their interactions believable, particularly the crew's relationship with their captain, Mal (Nathan Fillion). Adam Baldwin's rendition of Jayne, the ""dumb muscle"" of the crew is flawless. Even the female characters are memorable which I find refreshing.All in all, this movie is more action than sci-fi. The fact that it is set in space is secondary, stylistically it mainly draws on elements of the wild west. That being said, this is a movie that definitely will entertain.",Serenity
824,darknite125,Best Sci-fi Movie in Years,10,22 May 2006,"I at first thought I was biased thinking this film was incredible being a die-hard Browncoat. But upon talking to others who saw the movie I soon realized I was not alone. I have been successful in telling people to rent the movie and if they did not like it I would give them their money back. So far I have not lost any money. There is not a single moment in the movie when you are not on the edge of your seat, laughing,or in shock. There were amazing performances by unknown actors and actresses, good special effects, a plot full of twists and surprises, and well choreographed fights. I hope to God a sequel will be in the works when Joss is finished with Wonder Woman, because a movie and a short lived television show are not enough to satisfy my desire to see the big damn heroes in their various adventures.",Serenity
825,barubin,Even better than expected,9,7 October 2005,"I'll admit it. I was a ""FireFly"" virgin before I watched the film. Now I'll have to watch those DVD's I purchased last year as a present for my spouse. As far as a review, I was very impressed by the chemistry of the characters. I thought that this was a ""big screen"" film that depended on spectacular special effects but it was character and story driven. There were only two impressive effects, IMHO, and I won't spoil it for anyone other than the first one is at the very beginning. Anyway, I think I could compare my reaction to someone that never saw the first Star Trek TV program and then saw the movies with Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty, and company; without any expectations, they'd be impressed with the characters' chemistry. And that is what makes for a good movie; the audience is involved and cares. I recommend it even for those who are not science fiction or space opera fans.",Serenity
826,Mattro,Serenity is a film everyone will enjoy,10,2 October 2005,"I have seen Serenity twice now... once with rabid fans of Firefly and the second time with friends who had never watched the series. Both teams of viewers had the same reaction: Serenity is an exhilarating white-knuckle roller coaster ride from the beginning to the end. Joss Whedon's writing/directing is effectively fast-paced. Serenity introduces the characters deftly and efficiently. It then promptly throws them into situations that will change their lives forever. Anyone who has been a fan of the Buffy, Angel or Firefly TV shows (all Whedon creations) knows that Mr. Whedon has the uncanny ability to strum your heartstrings, make you laugh or make you very scared at his whim... sometimes all within the same scene!Serenity is a wonderful entertaining sci-fi yarn that hits all of its notes and stays in tune from beginning to end. Fans of great sci-fi will love Serenity. Those who appreciate a well crafted action story will love it as well. And though Serenity takes place 500 years in the future, fans of westerns will also enjoy this film for it has that western movie swagger in abundance. Finally, this message goes out to every person who ever complained about the most recent three Star Wars films for whatever reason (bad writing, wooden acting, poor directing, etc): Serenity gets it all right and you owe it to yourself to check it out and have your socks entertained right off of you.",Serenity
827,SMWinnie,Disappointing only in light of expectations,7,27 November 2005,"I enjoyed Firefly and the first several seasons of Buffy more than anything else on TV over the past several years, so I was predisposed to like Serenity. And I did.Joss Whedon does at least two things extremely well. He writes intelligent, snappy dialog with a dry, disaffected style that is both engaging and immediately recognizable. He also has a Dickensian capacity to create interesting secondary characters and antagonists with a minimum of exposition. Both talents are very much in evidence in Serenity.Having said that, I was disappointed. The movie struck me as a collection of individually interesting and well-executed scenes that didn't quite hang together properly as a whole.",Serenity
828,gojulas,"Fun and clever, with characters you can actually care for.",10,2 October 2005,"The first thing that gets lost in a science fiction epic is the characters. To often they become mere excuses to display more special effects. In Serenity the characters take center stage. You may not care for all of them, but you can't deny that they have been fleshed out.Throw in Joss Wheaton's snappy dialog and fast pacing, and you have the ingredients for a fun movie. Many may describe Serenity as a western in space, but I think it has more in common with the comedies of the thirty's. Arch comments, quick comebacks, and amusing turns of phrases rule the day.I highly recommend this film for anyone tired of the cookie cutter action flick, but who's still interested in seeing an action flick.",Serenity
829,The Movieman,Firefly Away,6,6 January 2006,"I am writing this as a novice. I have never seen the show before and, honestly I felt a bit lost. The story is easy to follow, but these are previously established characters with a background presented on the show. I understand why creator/writer/director Whedon could not put everything that happened in the 15 episodes on the big screen, but in order to take this movie, Serenity, beyond its Browncoat fan base, he needed to find a way to bring in the others as well.I found the movie to simply be OK. It's certainly not bad -- much of the hate, IMO, comes from Star Wars fans taking insult from the Browncoats, and I am not a huge Star Wars fan either -- but it also wasn't anything special. The visual effects are pretty standard (stuff you can see on the SciFi Channel), the acting is pretty standard and the writing/direction from Whedon wasn't engaging.I feel that while Serenity is certainly pleasing (to say the least) to fans of ""Firefly"", it's too inclusive for it's own good. If Whedon wanted to give his series a final send off or a renewal, perhaps a deal with the SciFi Channel would be more logical (perhaps doing a 9-part, Dune-like mini-series).I'm quite down the middle with Serenity. It has it's moments, but I don't see why some consider it to be one of the best science fiction movies. Yes, Whedon certainly has the imagination (this is coming from a fan of the Buffy and Angel series), but this one needed more than that for me to consider it even good...",Serenity
830,art-imd,Cartoonish,2,21 December 2005,"If you like anime, short ping-pong cuts and video game effects, this is THE movie for you. However, I found it tedious and ill filmed. Especially the dialogue was not up to par, with lack of intonation, ping-pong cuts stealing the attention away from the dialogue, and a voice mix that cut off all treble, making it sound like ALL the actors has a speech impediment and can't say ""S"" (this on the US DVD version, which also lacks a DTS soundtrack -- the movie experience might be different).The plot was predictable, and typical anime hero. Nothing new, and nothing deep. You still are left with a feeling that a lot was cut out that would give much needed background. If I had seen the TV series, I might possibly have had a better experience, but not having done that, I felt I missed out.A couple of the better filmed sequences were better done in the originals they borrowed from -- Mad Max, Blade Runner and the archetypical martial arts movie.All in all, I'd say this is an over-hyped yawner, unless you like this particular genre, but with some good effects and up and coming actors.",Serenity
831,sonyalynn,This movie has *everything*...,10,10 October 2005,"...including the kitchen sink, although it might fall off with a piece of heat shielding.As one professional movie critic noted, ""these are the people the Enterprise would blow right by and never even notice."" This is no glamorous space-faring future.Our captain and first mate were on the losing side of a hard-fought war, so now they take their weaponless smuggler's ship and home, Serenity, and try to stay as far from the victorious Alliance as possible. Amidst a lack of all worklegal or otherwiseour crew, all on the run from enemies external and internal, find themselves with a world of hurt bearing down upon them.The Alliance has decided that one fugitive on their unprepossessing boata young girl subjected to Mengele-like experiments to enhance her mental ""sensitivity"" and make her into something of a super-spy/assassinis important. Our unwilling psychic might just have plucked thoughts and memories from the top secret heads of ""key members"" of Parliament. What memories, they don't know, but that's not a risk they're willing to take. A nameless and RUTHLESS Operative is dispatched to recover her at any costHe's a villain for the 21st century, played brilliantly by Chiwetel Ejiofor (""Dirty Pretty Things"") as a man who'll compliment you and make you feel better about the death he's currently visiting upon you. With no more discernible emotion than an affable smile, but with skill in brutality suitable to a Japanese warlord of yore and an unshakable belief that ends of his Alliance masters always justify the means.Life is looking to get very ""interesting"" (in the sense of the old Chinese curse, ""May you live in interesting times"") for our crew on the ""raggedy edge"" of grounding their dreams from internal tensions caused by lack of money, food, and resources.And there's the set-up for an intense chase around this fascinating solar systema battle of wits and wills, with both the discovery of the truth of things and a new reason for the crew of Serenity to give their all.The beautiful thing about this story is that it didn't really have to be sci-fi. A few tweaks and it could have really been told in any of the more adventuresome genres. What's more, the chemistry between the actors coming to Serenity from the TV show, ""Firefly"", to which it's a self-contained extension, is excellent. The fact that they'd lived and interacted as these characters through the filming of 13 episodes of the show really comes through.You don't even need to have seen Firefly to love Serenity. A friend-of-a-friend who came with me in a gaggle to watch a screening walked out saying that she felt it was ""f*ucking awesome""...and she's not even a sci-fi fan as far as I know.Having already commended Ejiofor as the cool, cruel Operative, the high-quality, if largely unknown, Firefly ensemble are very bit as good.Nathan Fillion, as captain Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds, wears the years of hurtand growing apprehension that the life he's now leading is nowhere near up to the standards he sets for himselfas comfortably as he does the brown coat that was the symbolic garment of his losing side in the ""Unification War"". His quixotic heart was smashed, and while he hides it under a layer of gruffness and laconic wit, it's still the heart of a hero fighting for an ideal he can't let go of. His reversion from battered cynic to rebel WITH a cause is evident in his eyes, expression, and bearing as the movie progresses. If Serenity doesn't launch Fillion to greater fame, there is no justice.Likewise, Summer Glau, as the shattered-yet-deadly savant, River Tam, essays her role with a sureness not seen from her even during the run of Firefly. Her performance both in and out of her eye-popping action sequences will alternately thrill, chill, and wrench your heart. River makes you want nothing to do with anyone who could have made her what she is.Firefly fans might complain that the other characters got short shrift... faithful first-mate and kick-a** warrior woman, Zöe (the ravishing Gina Torres); quipster and ace pilot, Wash (Alan Tudyk); ship's mechanic and almost naïve optimist Kaylee (Jewel Staite); thuggish and mercenary Jayne (Adam Baldwin...no relation); galactic courtesan Inara (the exotic Morena Baccarin); preacher-with-a-past, Shepherd Book (Ron Glass); and ship's medic and protective older brother to River, Simon (Sean Maher), whose daring liberation of River is what set both the events of the show and the movie in motion. But each is given their own arc, at least a few good lines and chances to shine, however briefly. And they take advantage of what screen time they have admirably.I imagine, if there are sequels, more time will be doled out to the crew members less emphasized this time around.It's a just critique that writer/director Joss Whedon is over-ambitious in trying to shoehorn so much plot in with a necessarily large ensemble, courtesy of the show. There're always going to be unwanted compromises in that, even with a longish movie (just short of 2 hrs). But I find it forgivable.What elevates Serenity well above standard genre fare (or most movies, regardless of genre) is the clear feeling of Serenity's crew-members for their home and each other and the visceral emotion that Whedon can make even a Firefly/Serenity ""newbie"" invest in these characters in short order. If you didn't love them walking in, you do soon after. There are no pat endings here...no gimmicky aliens, and even the ship is falling apart. Verisimilitude is the word of the day in the Serenity 'verse, and no one can make the incredible believable like Joss Whedon. So, see this movie, and help this amazing crew fly again!",Serenity
832,lauren-71,Great for newcomers and even better for old hands,10,2 October 2005,"This movie is an excellent piece of film-making  the plot is tight, the characters are engaging, and the action is exciting. There are several tense moments, lots of hilarious lines, and a few things that might break your heart a little. If you haven't seen the show ""Firefly"" on which it's based, this is still a great and worthwhile movie to catch. Pay attention to what's going on and you won't miss a beat. If you have seen ""Firefly"", then I'd wager you already know and love these characters and this world, and this movie will be the perfect cinematic continuation of everything you loved. Either way, I highly recommend you check out ""Serenity""!",Serenity
833,aram09,A good film that killed the firefly franchise,8,15 November 2006,"Fans of Firefly will slip into this film almost from the moment it starts. If this is the first exposure to the story then you will find things proceed a little quickly. As no explicit attempt is made to introduce characters, which Whedon stated was deliberate, you may find yourself a little detached from the action for the first 3rd of the film. That's not to say the first 3rd isn't good movie, merely that it will take time to fully appreciate what goes on between the various characters.A 'western in space' theme actually works very well, the outlying planets corresponding to the wild west in old USA, with harsh living coinciding with hi-tech equipment. This fits in well with the idea that, although technology advances, humans remain the same as always. This, I think, is the reason why the merging of sci-fi and western in this film doesn't degenerate into something farcical, as the availability of technology hasn't mutated people into demi-gods like you see in Star Trek and the like.The witty dialogue and character interaction that were always a feature of the series are fully evident in this film, and many of the threads that ran through the series are present. Kaylee and Simon's mutual and STILL unrequited love crops up, and River's instability is also here, playing a fairly central role to the film itself.This film is very watchable by anyone. For the Browncoats it was a poignant moment in history; the funeral march of an excellent series cut down in its infancy.****Spoilers below****And this is what has, in my opinion, killed off any hope of Firefly coming back. In addition to Kaylee and Simon 'getting it on' at the end of the film, we have River showing everyone why the Alliance want her so badly and what they made her become. The secret of the Reavers is also revealed, and both main characters of Wash and Shepherd are killed.The Reavers become solid characters, face-to-face with the crew, removing a lot of the mystique and horror associated with them. A large number of them must have died at the hands of the Alliance, else the soldiers would not have appeared at the end. What Reavers there were on the planet were like as not killed by River who unleashed her full powers, becoming a lethal weapon far exceeding even Buffy.So many of the threads that held the viewer to Firefly and were developing at the right pace were cut short in this film that I fail to see what could be the driving force behind another series.**** Spoilers End ****",Serenity
834,nrg-14,The depth of the screenplay is rare. We need more films like it.,10,13 May 2006,"Serenity is a unique and stand alone story in itself. I have enjoyed this SciFi creation better than any other entertainment before or since. I came across the story of 'Firefly' late at night, it was shown after Star Trek. Because I saw my first episode out of sequence it made no sense, I saw one more episode and just gave up on the whole concept. The disjointed distribution of the series is a saga in itself. Then I saw 'Serenity' on the large screen and realized the 'Firefly' TV series was worth seeing, in fact it is a must see experience and if possible watch all the episodes before 'Serenity'. There have been very few stories to engage the imagination like these. I can watch and enjoy both the TV series and the Movie regularly. 'Firefly' and 'Serenity' are rare pearls in the sea of drama today. Worth purchasing the DVD of the movie and the DVD set of the TV series. Joss Whedon is a genius, as time I am sure will tell. Do yourself a favor and step into Joss Whedon's 'Verse' you won't regret it.",Serenity
835,aearly-3,I very fine series of one year,10,26 November 2009,"This show was excellent but it was pitched to the wrong network. It finally arrived on the SciFi channel where it really belonged. Unfortunately, the series had already been canceled over at FOX. FOX is the republican propaganda channel and they can't handle anything with more than seven letters in the name. But FOX is great with children's shows and retarded political commentators. If this idea was pitched directly to SYFY as they call themselves now it would still be a running series. When it ran on SYFY it was extremely popular. Complex characters and with complex themes are the bread and butter of NBC. Since NBC owns SYFY the show should have started there.I wish Serenity was still on because I loved the characters and the complexity of the plot. Most viewers can easily understand complex plots that are well presented and Serenity was a perfect blend of writing, directing and acting thanks to Joss Whedon. I even got the little inside ""joke"" in the show like the bounty hunter Jubal Early. Nathan Fillion is a descendant of Jubal A. Early who was a Confederate General in the civil war. So am I. It was ""funny"" to me that an African American was named after a Confederate General. There were all kinds of things buried in the sub-plot which made the show even more fun to watch. I miss Serenity. It was and still is a brilliant show.",Serenity
836,bobstoysforyou,Best Movie of the Year,10,8 July 2006,"This really was the best and most underrated movie of the year. It should have been far more popular than it was. The characters are great and well developed, the plot was intriguing and genuine, and the way it all played out was both surprising and run.My favorite part of the movie was that one never knew what was coming. Whether it was the constant danger of all the characters or the unmet desires of the crew, one was always on her toes trying to figure out what was coming next. All fans, especially ones that like sci-fi will love this movie. Also, if you like this movie, make sure to check the backstory in the Firefly series. IT was on TV for 1 year and gives a much deeper view of the characters.",Serenity
837,gits_1979,This was sheer brilliance.,10,10 June 2006,"I have watched both the movie and the series multiply times and the are both excellent. What makes them great is that they have such brilliant characters, that you actual like, even Jayne has great presence and each feeds brilliantly of the other. It is what most films miss, good characters that you actually could meet in a bar (in this case you better be a brown coat). They are simply real people set in a harsh environment trying to survive in a verse (Mal's name for the universe) gone made. It just has a real feel with everything being explained you can understand what is going on nothing goes over your head. Finally, it has some of the best one liners in any film I have seen (if you want to know what they are watch the film, but before you do that watch the series). No one will be disappointed in watching this film, even if you don't like sci-fi watch this film. My brother got into the series after watching the film (he watched it and became a brown coat) and he don't even like sci-fi. He is also a picky film watcher and for him to get excited about any film it best be good.",Serenity
838,chappersrc,The best whim I ever bought!,10,20 August 2006,"I was shopping and I was bored so I decided to buy a cheap DVD to go home, watch and then forget about. I'd vaguely heard of Serenity and I knew Joss Whelan was usually good so i bought it. I went home and saw it, and then watched it again!.It blew me away, witty, innovative in a word amazing.Before I saw Serenity I'd never heard of Firefly but after the film i decided that I had to see them and now its my top TV show ever. The best film I've seen in a while and definitely the best Sci-Fi film I ever saw, including the Star Wars originals. I recommend it to anyone who wants good action, great acting, witty dialogue and a more serious side with a little social comment thrown in for good measure.",Serenity
839,penguin-man222,Serenjity - The opposite of Serenity,10,27 June 2006,"Here you need to understand that I am an action sci-fi movie nut, I love this movie to death.Me, being a big fan of science fiction movies and TV shows, loved this movie to death. it had good photography, a great story line, and it continued from the Firefly TV show very nicely. It had a very original soundtrack. It had a good humorous touch to go with it, but it also managed to stay realistic and exiting. it also had a very good side love-story going on.I would compare this movie to a few of my other favorite movies, such as Star Trek: Nemesis, it is violent, exiting and full of unexpected surprises. I could also compare this movie to Lord of the Rings, mostly because of the orc-like enemies you find in Serenity.Don't BE FOOLED BY THE NAME! this movie is not as peaceful as the name might say, it is violent and bloody to the edge of a pg-13 extent... THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN! I would probably allow a 12-year-old child see this movie, maybe 11, but I'm not a parent so I wouldn't know much about that -_-' In conclusion, this movie is exiting, action packed, funny and has a very good moral to it. I gave it a ten star because it's my favorite movie, you might not find it as exiting as I did.",Serenity
840,fruityoatybar92,The proof that cinema isn't dead.,10,12 May 2007,"If there is any reason that i still want to direct when i grow up, its because of this movie.I had watched the firefly episodes a week before the movie came out, and i knew-this show might be something special. i had seen some episodes of Buffy before and loved them but didn't understand why they were great. this Joss Whedon guy..the critics love him and hes funny in interviews and he's pretty cool. Thats all i really knew.WHat Joss brings in Serenity is a vision of the future not quite like any other. I mean, we've all seen the evil-future-government-versus cool rebels plot, but what he haven't seen (or realized) is that in the future, people will still have the same struggles, particularly emotional ones. Maybe we wont have aliens, or teleportation, or lightsabers. Maybe people will still have trouble telling the people that we love how we feel, or trouble with marriages, struggles with faith, maybe even have the same personality quirks/traits. The dialog is beautiful and crackling, and the characters are extremely well developed. The film shows how genre bending can be done, and if you saw the series, the film is likely to make someone cry like i did the first time i saw it.I think that if i hadn't seen this movie, which confirmed my status as a serenity fanatic (called a brown-coat), i would be a completely different person. I would look at movies i watch or write very differently, look at drama and acting very differently, speak very differently, and would just be a different thinker and person. Kinda like what the muppets did to my imagination and sense of entertainment and life.This movie is one of the coolest, smartest, wittiest, most exciting movie in a long time, and will appeal to any fan of movies or the TV show, but you might want to watch the TV show first.",Serenity
841,jonathantate76,"Very Cool, Very Enjoyable Sci-Fi",8,26 July 2006,"This is a great movie for anyone who enjoys sci-fi, westerns or sci-fi-westerns. With the Serenity universe, Joss Whedon shows his skills by mixing seemingly opposite ends of the aesthetic/story-telling spectrum to wonderful and entertaining effect:The old & the new. The familiar & the original. The surreal & the down-to-earth. The flippant & the deadly serious. The fanciful & the realistic.Sounds like a mess? It's not. The overall feel of the movie is as natural as any other flick you are ever likely to see. This is largely due to the passion of performance delivered by the ensemble cast. Real chemistry. And not a star among them.The movie follows a group of space outlaws/heroes as they tear around their adopted nu-solar system in a 'Firefly-class' star-ship, generally trying to avoid the authoritarian 'Alliance' and earn their living by hook or by crook. Of course, things get very complicated because they are mainly dangerous fugitives wanted by the law; with some more wanted & dangerous than others. What sets this movie apart from the average sci-fi caper, though, is it's fresh take on so many elements of the genre. For once, we are seeing a more likely far-flung space movie future with the portrayal of the all-human galaxy, the silent vacuum of space, terra-formed colonies aren't full of sparkling technology and our heroes are more apt to do what's necessary than what's moral. And people dress and talk and act and live as they might if they really lived on the outer-edge frontier planets of this universe.The dialogue is snappy and funny. The plot is well paced and rewards your attention. The special effects serve the story, not vice-versa.It's not perfect, though. The occasional plot-hole could make you cringe. But if you can suspend your disbelief for those few moments, I recommend you see this movie if you wanna see a film which is easy to watch yet satisfying because of it's different slant on an often clichéd genre.",Serenity
842,Glin-1,disappointing movie,4,5 October 2005,"Almost fell asleep during this space soap opera.""I know that I am evil"" - what kind of writing is that. I want to live in a world without sin? None of these characters seem to tick. They just exist to complicate a plot based on rehashed and oversimplified sci-fi notions such as terraforming, ESP, and anti-Utopian visions of the future. Then it rips off star wars without remorse. It doesn't not carry that epic grandioseness of star wars, nor any sensible anthropological extrapolation of future worlds and technologies. You have psychic River doing martial arts. This is just a high budget TV movie following all your typical formulas. Don't waste your money on this one",Serenity
843,lesbiassparrow,Hard to understand in parts and a little cheap looking,4,9 September 2006,"Somewhat incomprehensible and rather cheap looking; fine for a television film but not really what I would look for in a cinema (which is why I am glad I saw it on HBO). I am assuming that this was the budget restrictions showing rather than a choice on the director's part.It would be better if the dialogue wasn't quite so horrifically quaint; I think I understand that Whedon was going for some sort of John Wayne period feel but I can understand Westerns from the 1930s better than I understood some of the conversation of this film.In short, a perfectly good TV film, but one I am glad I didn't see in the cinema. (Was it just me or did the plot expect you to suddenly take leaps of understanding for which there were no clues? I assume that was the Firefly background to the series which would have made viewing this easier.)",Serenity
844,tribblelyn,Space western,10,4 September 2006,"Brilliant spin off film based on the short lived TV series Firefly. This film contained a breath taking mixture of action and adventure, a cast that you could relate to and who obviously worked well together and excellent special effects (although these did not detract from the film, they enhanced it). Joss Whedon should be congratulated on turning out a stunning piece of work. I can very happily recommend this film to a wide audience, not just to die hard sci-fi fans. The mixture of the old with the new, of sci-fi with westerns works surprisingly well and the lack of obvious aliens as used in so much science fiction is a refreshing change. Long may Serenity soar.",Serenity
845,bobmay-3,Rock On Joss!!,9,9 September 2006,I think my favorite part of this DVD was Joss Whedon's introduction of the film. I'm guessing that must of been for an early screening because he says it has temporary effects and temporary music etc. But who cares. this guy has more heart and more enthusiasm and more talent than anyone else in Hollywood! One of the other reviews that the efx were weak. I totally disagree. I totally could see the difference in the quality of the efx in the film versus the TV show efx.But I will say that the story seemed more violent and graphic than the typical TV shows. And I was a little disappointed by that.But you've got to love Joss Whedon for how hard he fought to get this movie made and I totally think it deserves to be seen by as many people as possible!!,Serenity
846,grey-47,Outstanding,10,3 February 2007,"This is probably the best movie I've ever seen in my life. The acting is flawless, the script perfect, the scenery is brilliant. It's funny, it's sad, it's explosive and sometimes suspenseful. It's intense at times, always interesting, and it moves along at just the right pace.The characters are laid out so well, by the end of the movie you feel like you've known them for years. Each character is consistent and belongs. The acting is just incredible... every single character was played to perfection. Little tidbits of information, powerful performances, and an awesome script makes these characters come to life in such a natural way that you barely notice you've been informed. It's almost magical how it all comes about, and it's all believable - the whole movie! The story is an Epic one, in my opinion... some twists and turns, a very interesting beginning leads up to an important and emotional ending, with a clear path as one looks back.The sound, the music, the special effects... all tremendous efforts. It sucks you in and you can't move from your seat until it's over. There isn't a single thing I would change in this movie.I can watch this movie over and over... I wish there were more like it. It's top notch entertainment from beginning to end. Somebody please make more movies like this one! After all these years, Serenity replaces Blade Runner as my all-time favorite movie.",Serenity
847,urh,Maybe if you're a fan,1,14 January 2007,"I just made the mistake of watching this film after reading a lot of positive reviews here - and unfortunately dismissing the unfavorable ones. My bad! Maybe if you're a fan of the series, you can connect to the characters and actually find something in this film. I haven't watched the series. So please take that into account. More than half of the film felt like it was a B-movie filmed in a StarWars set. The plot is thin, and not very original, and the attempt at humor is about 10th grade level. The characters are one-dimensional at best, more like they sprang from a cartoon. Basically every scene of this movie has been done somewhere else before, and quite often better. If you really don't have anything better to do, it's raining outside, and there's nothing exciting on TV like curling or shuffle board - please go ahead and watch this film.

I gave it 10/10 because it really is good, but I can see that someone who hasn't seen the original series may have problems, so I'd strongly recommend you get the DVD of the series first, watch it, then see the movie, but see the MOVIE whatever :-)The movie has a lot of nice comedy lines, but I feel that some work best knowing the history of the characters, as shown in the series. The action is pretty good as well, especially the ""bad guy"" from the Alliance.The general ""feel"" of the movie is close to the series, but Whedon has taken it and added a good cinematic sense to it. I was impressed by the camera work, some lovely shots of the crew in the initial sequences, also improvements in the interior of Serenity from the TV series, not sure if we ever saw them moving seamlessly between the different decks",Serenity
849,BAdgerofire,Joss Whedon at his best,10,2 October 2005,"I definitely think that this is the beginning of a new Sci-Fi franchise! The writing, the humor, the characters, and the story are just so strong. You definitely need to see this movie whether you are a fan of Scifi or not. I am a big fan of Joss Whedon's work from of course his Buffy and Angel days, the writing in both of those shows was way under rated. One friend who saw the movie with me made the comment that the movie was a bit predictable, but I think it was predictable only when it wanted to be if that makes any sense. The overall story itself and some happenings were not predictable at all, the fact that the girl was eventually gonna kick some major ass was. I close by saying I thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience and plan on seeing it again in the theater.",Serenity
850,dcalvin75,"good god, this rocked!",10,9 October 2006,"OK, i know what you're thinking--Only sci-fi nerds are buzzing about this one.man, i was skeptical too. My now husband talked me into going to this one with the ""It's from the same guy who did 'ANGEL'."" Loved that show. So, i go. If anything it's a night away from the house. Right away i notice a lot of the actors also had stints in Buffy or Angel. It was kinda cool. I had no idea there had already been a short-lived TV show. You don't have to have watched one episode to enjoy this picture. The music, storyline...I have nightmares about reevers(sp.?) that is a scary concept-humans so messed up they eat people alive, rape their corpses, wear their skin as clothing...so gross,so frightening, so...fantastic.the hunt for truth while being chased by a glorified bounty hunter. Jane so full of crap, Summer so cryptic but kicka##, Kaylie so sunny, Zoey (2nd in command and old war buddy of the cap'n)and Wash(pilot and Zoey's husband)together i never did buy it,Doc(summer's bro.) tried hard to be stoic but he loved his sister too much, and Mal(Malcolm) Reynolds an honorable rascal.This story has them flying through space to find truth out of propaganda, to flee a government desperate to stop them before it is found.. i really don't want to spoil the storyline for anyone left out there who hasn't seen this. I went right out and bought the TV series and watch the episodes over and over again. This movie is worth buying-don't just rent it.A 10 most definitely.",Serenity
851,mr_larsson,"Expect to be entertained, not profoundly affected...",9,2 February 2007,"The leagues of Whedon fans invading this section and giving their movie 10/10 are perhaps misrepresenting it a bit. NVM, there are always fanboys around when it comes to sci-fi. Equally though, people who come here to give it 4/10 just to ""balance"" the score are being quite childish.I have never seen Firefly and my girlfriend bought ""Serenity"" because a friend of hers recommended it. (Very out of character by the way, she hasn't even seen ""Star Wars"" and I've had the special edition box set for ages now) I had never heard of this film so sat down to watch it with no preconceived ideas what so ever.I was very pleasantly surprised.What makes a movie deserve a high score? Does it have to be so gripping it makes you feel nauseous and depressed for days afterwards like for example ""The war zone"" or ""Once we were warriors""? Can't a supreme piece of light entertainment deserve a high score as well? This movie never attempts to be anything else but that. It's a great roller-coaster ride of a sci-fi movie done on a quite low budget, with excellent art direction, effects, solid characters and a tight script. For me it came in completely under the radar and surprised me. This film is such pleasant watching that I have now seen it 3 times and that to me is a sign of a great movie as well. It makes me feel good and I enjoy myself when I watch it. It's not highbrow in the slightest but it never tries to be, it's a space opera for God's sake. Compare it to the likes of ""Starship Troopers"" or ""Dr Who"" if anything.If you like sci-fi you'll like this I bet. You might like ""The Matrix"" more and you might think ""Aliens"" and ""Star Wars"" are better but for me this little unassuming film is up there with them. It's masterfully executed light entertainment and it doesn't try to be anything other than that.",Serenity

From the start we get swept up in the lives of the crew. You DON'T need to have seen Firefly, it might make you feel more connected to the characters from the outset but it isn't compulsory to have seen it to thoroughly enjoy it as my viewing partner proved, he is now desperate to get his hands on the DVDs.I'd recommend this to anyone who liked not only sci-fi but general action flicks as well as character drive stories because that is what this is a character driven story that has plenty of action and the living in space is simply the setting.

This movie was a very worthy and worthwhile jump to the big screen. It picked up nicely where the series left off, but also clued in the folks who had never seen the series in a very comfortable fashion.*POTENTIAL MINI-SPOILERS* My only misgiving is that, while I am firmly in the ""bring back firefly"" camp, the deaths of *THREE* main characters leaves me wondering if it could really be done with the spirit of the original show still intact. It would be nearly impossible to imagine a Firefly with no wash, Shepherd Book, or no Simon. That said, though, Serenity was a thrill ride, and I couldn't have asked for better! Shiny!",Serenity
855,liria,"Oh, Wow!",10,1 October 2005,"For those who are fans of the TV series Firefly, this is a must see anyway, but even if you have not heard of the TV series you can still enjoy this movie. The characters are sufficiently well introduced to get across how they typically interact with each other, which is crucial to both the TV series and the movie. You will be entertained throughout the entire movie.I went into the movie with extremely high expectations (because of the TV series), and not only was I not disappointed, but it was 10 times better than I hoped it to be. So much so that 2 friends and I walked out of one showing and bought tickets and walked right back into the next showing to see it again. (This is a rare thing - I have only seen 3 movies more than once in the theater, and never done it back to back like that before.)I've always been a huge Star Wars fan (mostly original trilogy, though Revenge of the Sith is one of those I saw more than once in theaters), but I am seriously considering buying the new t-shirt at ThinkGeek.com that says, 'Joss Whedon is my master now.'",Serenity
856,achilleszhu2006,Authentic movie,7,23 February 2007,"What I felt the most about Serenity is that it was a very authentic science fiction.The story plot is clear and realistic,which will draw your attention more to the story than enjoying the visual effects.The crew of Serenity were a bunch of people adventuring in the universe ,surviving the dictatorship of the federal union,and it was their dream of freedom which caused their decision to reveal the truth that the government had been causing negative aspects through inappropriate methods to the universe by media against the hamper from federal. The speaking of Mandarin and universal attires in the movie created an ambiance of the human beings' cultural integration and unity after the destruction of earth,it's hard to find another movie like this. But take it from me,drawbacks of the film,in a large extent,deducted the attraction of the movie.For instance,the background music was insufficient in both quality and frequency during the film,resulting in poor display of characters' emotions;on the other hand,dramatic entertaining was diminished a little due to the authentication of the movie,the action scenes were inadequate,and sometimes the story could be tedious.Otherwise the ""Serenity"" would be classical.",Serenity
857,flavien-huynh,Over-hyped bad movie,2,13 March 2007,"I saw the movie before the TV show, and with great expectations. After all, the first explosive minutes of the movie had been made available on Internet, and people were praising Wedon as the 'new and improved' George Lucas.And the result ?I found the acting so poor that when the CG wasn't on screen, some parts reminded of a sub-par post-apocalyptic ""let's redo Mad Max with no money and no real actors"" movie. As the movie navigated through a very predictable plot, the unease grew stronger, and although some ideas were good (only because they had been used with better fortune by more talented people), they were just floating in an ocean of mediocrity. In the end, I was very disappointed at Wedon, the Internet, and my being so naive.As if I hadn't learned from this disaster, I recently saw the TV show, eager to see ""the real thing"", which should contain the interest, pace, freshness that were absent of the movie. To my dismay, there was nothing to my liking in the TV show ... wrong music, wrong acting (the same cast), wrong stories ... I have to admit I couldn't make it past the third episode ... there was no point in hurting myself so bad, when there are shows like ""Battlestar Galactica"" that blast ""Firefly"" out of the sky, only leaving a trail of bad memories.To sum up, the Serenity/Firefly experience was a very bad one for me. And I'm usually rather lenient when it comes to plot holes or approximative acting ... the problem is that Wedon found the perfect cinematographic repellent pattern for me ...",Serenity
858,mynameiskenny,Terrible,4,1 October 2005,"I have a list of grievances I would like to air against this movie.1) The acting is horrible. Particularly the brother-doctor, but particularly the captain. But particularly the cute engineer. Any scene with the two of them talking is always painfully, painfully bad.2) Joss Whedon writes terrible dialogue. I mean, yes, it's clever, and yes, a lot of it is funny, but it's much too self-conscious at the same time. You can imagine Whedon typing ""insert laugh track here."" It's designed to make all but the best actors look stupid, and again, let's face it, the acting is not good at all.3) Reavers are a stupid idea. They're basically space zombies, right? They were caused by a gas that makes them want to kill everyone, but NOT EACH OTHER. And they've still got enough intelligence to fly planes. The idea of a pack of human-animals who are full of mindless aggression BUT still retain their higher brain functions is not only doesn't make a whole lot of sense, it's also not very frightening.4) The main bad guy is a copout. He's a true believer, they tell us, and then he's converted just so easily to the good side! If a guy who truly had unwavering faith as much as he did, who believed himself a monster, had his faith shattered so much that he could no longer believe... well, one he'd either kill himself, or two he'd hate the people who shattered his faith. Not that I believe that what he saw would shatter his faith.5) The characters aren't drawn out very well. Maybe they are in the TV show, I've only seen a couple episodes. But they don't come across very well on the big screen.",Serenity
859,rsklnkv,Grade 'A' Speculative Sci-Fi.,10,8 November 2005,"Serenity is (I say this without hesitation) the best science fiction film to be made in recent memory. I'm a big 'Blade Runner' fan (Don't really like 'Star Wars'), so if you don't like being challenged when you watch a film, maybe this ain't for you. Being a Browncoat I am ridiculously giddy that Joss was able to reunite the cast and shoot this masterpiece. The fact that this movie didn't make as much money as many other films that were released around the same time speaks volumes to me about the poor taste and expectations of American audiences (They are so used to crap they crave it now). This one is for true film fans. People who enjoy a good story, great actors and a thoughtful vision of the future will be smitten. GO JOSS!",Serenity

The film delivered magnificently and was such a cool ride. The plot was good, plenty to feast on there. The special effects were terrific and very exciting when only a few rows back. The humour funny and there was plenty of amusing moments. The acting was great and the writing superb. There's not a minute wasted. It's totally absorbing and emotional and the audience were riveted. There's also a couple of shocks but obviously can't say what they are. Firefly fans won't be disappointed. The fairly long Q&A session afterwards suggests there will probably be a sequel or 2 :-) The entire cast attended plus Joss Whedon and the executive producer, Christopher Buchanan.

Did your Dad purchase a home theatre sound system to enhance enjoyment of car crashes and explosion effects in his own living room? Hoo boy, will he LOVE the thrills in ""Serenity!""

This movie delivers what most over-hyped, over-budgeted, over-processed ""blockbusters"" only promise. ""Serenity"" is the real deal. Someday you'll tell folks that you saw ""Serenity"" when it first came out the way I tell my kids that I stood in line for the first weekend of ""STAR WARS."" Yup.

It did for me, at any rate.As for the non-fans..good action sequences, a very good story, clever dialog, excellent acting, and some of the best pacing I've ever seen in a movie ought to be enough reasons for you to go see it. If someone who has never even heard of the show or any of the characters can be emotionally impacted by some of the story developments, it really shows that it's a well-made film, if you ask me.

I wont go into details but this movie has something for everyone. Its a science fiction film - but the Cast and script are so good that even people who generally hate sci-fi will enjoy this (My wife is a great example of this!) I have one word of warning..... For maximum enjoyment, watch at least four or five episodes of Firefly before watching Serenity.

866,usedomsurf,Not a good film,5,24 November 2005,"Having been attracted by so many favorable comments I expected really something special. Unfortunately I was quite disappointed by a rather common storyline for a science fiction film and a foreseeable development. A big interstellar union with problems at its outer parts is not too new (already the ancient Rome had to deal with it), a group of ""rebels"" in a shaky vehicle is even more common. But worse than this is that you do not really care for the characters. This would not matter so much if the film was funnier or more suspenseful. But the way it is (rather conventional)at least some strong actors would be necessary to make it work. Blending in many different genres and stealing from other films is also no big contribution. Maybe this film is only recommendable for the hard-boiled fans.",Serenity

So, take THAT program cancelers, whoever you were!I accidentally ""discovered"" the Firefly series at Wal-mart one evening looking for something new to watch - I never saw it while it was TV during it's short lifespan.

Serenity is a first class rollicking space adventure! Joss navigates our crew through scenes with outrageous action and humor while retaining and expanding their emotional depth from the series. The first half was a little slow but it quickly picked up pace and doesn't let up until the credits roll. The effects are also first rate and even when the situation is a little goofy they tend to add an air of reality. If only they had this kind of money for the effects in the series.

The movie was nicely shot; I was sucked into the story and ended up a positively surprised person.Of course I went through all the extras on the DVD (luckily there were extras on the rental version I had). Then I learned the whole background of this being a Sci-Fi television series that apparently got cancelled but fortunately got to do what most cancelled series never get to do: the made a full motion picture that took care of all they had wanted to tell in the series.Loved it.

Sort of, ""hey, great flick Joss, we think there could be a show deal in this - whaddya think?"" but all the ends are neatly tied off & it seems there's nowhere else to go. Still, I'll be going to see it again tomorrow & will snap it off the shelf on release day when it comes out on DVD. Many family members will be receiving it as a gift from me as well. I was so caught up in the action I would occasionally hear the people in the row behind me snickering as I cowered down in my seat with my shoulders so tense they were up over my ears, or I clapped & uttered a ""yeah!"" when things went spectacularly well.

873,joelleebean06,"A bit disappointing for Firefly fans, but a decent film on its own.",8,24 March 2009,"---This review contains spoilers---The first time I saw this movie, I had never even heard of the TV series Firefly it was based on. I saw it solely as a Joss Whedon fan. I enjoyed it all the same- there were likable characters, excellent fight scenes, and Whedon's humor could've held the movie up all on its own! Nearly a year later, I finally got around to viewing the Firefly series, and I must say, the movie now seems a bit of a disappointment. The fun western feel of the show is replaced with a colder, darker feel (evident even in the lighting scheme). Two of the main characters are barely even in the movie, and many major character relations and personalities were skimmed down to a bare minimum. I understand that as a movie, it needs to be presented in a way so that everyone, even non-fans, can understand it, but I thought Whedon went a bit too far. The character development and relationships were what made the show so special. I also felt really let down by the fact that we hardly get any answers that were posed in the TV show, and vaguely in the movie. Did Wash and Zoe ever come to a decision about having a baby? What secrets is Book hiding about his past? Why did Inara leave her home to sail with Serenity in the first place? I thought we would at least get the satisfaction of even slight answers to these questions- but as most of these characters were simply background in the film, they didn't even apply. We did, however, finally discover what exactly happened to River at the Academy, which I did find very interesting and satisfying. I was a bit skeptical about her hidden, nearly superhuman combat skills, but it did make for some spectacular fight scenes. I felt vindicated on her behalf. But the whole 'secret' of Miranda and the reason for River's repressed psychological problems was incredibly anti-climactic, centering around the creation of Reavers, which were only showcased twice in the entire TV series. ""That's it?"" was all I could say about it. I find it hard to believe that Mal would so blatantly risk the lives of his crew, people he cares very much about, for such a reason. (And I might as well comment on the ridiculousness of Mal threatening to shoot down those on his crew who refused to help him- I know he's in a dark place here, but come on!)But as a film separate from the TV series, I think it holds up quite well. Though the film offers no closure or finality that I was hoping for, it is an entertaining and well-acted piece of work. The characters still retain remnants of themselves, the action is exciting, and the new villain is quietly and calmly creepy. And the sarcastic and witty humor always makes my day. Definitely worth viewing, whether you're familiar with the series or not.",Serenity
874,athena1176,Disappointed Firefly fan **SPOILERS**,7,7 October 2005,"I gave Serenity a 7 because on its own, it's a great movie. That being said, I wish Joss hadn't changed the characters so much.He could have easily left the characters' personalities and their interactions with each other the way they were when Firefly ended. Mal comes off as a hard ass without the soft side that makes him likable in Firefly. Kaylee isn't the bubbly, sweet girl we left. Not to mention the interactions between Mal and Zoe are so businesslike, moviegoers would never know they were friends from the war. Anyone who saw the Firefly episode, Ariel, will remember that Mal considers Simon and River part of his crew and is protective of them, but in the opening scenes of Serenity, Mal and Simon get into it and Mal tells Simon he's just a passenger.

You won't want to miss a second of this one.There's plenty here for everybody: Good writing, humor, excellent acting, plot, action (that actually makes sense in terms of the plot), excellent cgi, eye candy.

Watch it in theater; don't just wait for the DVD.If you saw Star Wars (the original) in the theater way back when, then this movie will evoke a similar feeling of awe.

Everything from Toy Story, to Buffy, to his newest project, ""Serenity."" I'll reiterate what you've probably already heard, that you don't have to be a fan of the series to appreciate this film. I took a group of friends that have never seen an episode, and they left the theater slack-jawed from the wild ride that is ""Serenity."" Joss Whedon presents a gritty vision of the future, replete with humor, action, and adventure. You need to see this film. This is a story that needed to be told, and it is a labor of love for Joss, and the cast and crew. You can tell even as you're watching it, that it's more than a movie. It's an experience. Don't miss it while it's still in theaters. While some wonder what is wrong with Hollwyood these days, Joss Whedon shows us all how to do it right.",Serenity

Adam baldwin was excellent and Nathan Fillion was superb as mal , a part he was born to play. All the girls are hot lol , Gina Torres as zoe is incredible and I loved both Inara and Kaylee..2 hotties whos full names escape me at the moment..hmm I think one is named morena and the other is Jewel.

By TRiXnLOXI wasn't sure how the film will be for non-Firefly viewers, as the people who are familiar with Firefly (the series Serenity is based on/continued from) may have a more 'I understood all that' type review. Many questions will be answered for the existing fans, but possibly more will be asked by others.Some of the original depth, richness, and 'humour in the face of death' of its characters--Firefly--were lost in the movie, possibly because of its fantastic fast-paced progressional plot. However the effort to sustain the basic and important aspects of each character--together with much fantabulously shockingly surprising existing and new information--made this movie quite satisfactory to absorb.The crew is brought together by the extremities of love, death, life, good, bad and anything else you can squeeze in between, which is a classic trademark of Whedon's works. SFX, acting, futuristic 'gadgets', and martial arts are worthy adversaries for other Sci-Fi movie hits, even Star Wars. Although surprisingly, there was a particular scene that felt a little melodramatic (enough to notice), and lacked the real, full-seeded emotions I would otherwise have felt.Went in with Serenity stuck on my back (true), gripped my seat, widened my eyes, jaw-dropped a few times, and walked out with Serenity in me.DON'T Stop the Signal.",Serenity
881,mhulsing,an average scifi film,6,23 November 2005,"Serenity was a nice watch for as long as it lasted. I came to the theater without too much knowledge about the series so I didn't expect that much, although I love scifi. What I saw was an okay scifi flick with emphasis on action elements. Not too many bright ideas or ""sense of wonder"" here. The film doesn't seem to aim for much more than to entertain. I liked the freshness of some characters and there were two or three scenes that stood out because of nice FX. But there were way too many elements that undermine these assets, like a really terrible score, a lack of original ideas, a certain folksy hipness, there is no sense of the vastness of space at all and I could go on. I wouldn't regret waiting to see this one in a couple of years on TV. I do not really recommend.",Serenity
882,joaber700,Entertaining but one-dimensional,7,11 December 2005,"I expect you already have a pretty good idea what this movie is about from other reviews. I believe this story has a great albeit classical setup. All in all it's a great space-opera with the right mix of swash-bucking and character development. So why do i write yet another review making vague statements as to why i like this film? The reason of course is to complain about the things i did not like.. The characters have great potential but sadly the group dynamics of Serenity's crew don't quite work out. In fact they act like people who have recently met, showing of one single role for the entire group (which is prone to easy change). The characters are not bad enough to be a problem, but i feel there is room for improvement here. Allso having the flashbacks contain more information about the structure of the alliance would probably help to give depth to the story. Anyway the single largest disappointment is the Hollywood ending. why do they do it? Here you have an relentless ""beleiver"" who without blinking admits that he is prepared to kill children to make way for ""a better world"". Then when the movie is almost over the hero makes him watch a film where people die and he just admits that he's been wrong and turns cloak. George Lucas spent an entire film trying to cover for Anakin actually changing side and it was still too quick.. I know it's a bit awkward to talk of reality in sci-fi movie but in my experience it's not the way people work. Sure people do bad things in the name of good, but they never switch sides, they just device moral that let's them go bad on things they don't like!",Serenity
883,djricky45,"Saddle Up, Grab Your Guns And Ride",9,13 October 2005,"I've never seen the TV version so I didn't have any preconceived opinions of its characters so I judged this film on its own merits and as such it can easily stand on its own. When 'Star Wars' was first released in the 1970's one critic described it as an 'old west cowboy movie set in space.' That same description could very easily describe this movie. You have all of the elements of those 'old cowboy westerns.' Add to the mix a secret to be learned with a mission to be accomplished and you have it all. Good Guys vs Bad Guys with guns blazing in the end leaving you wondering who will come walking out of the smoke when all the shooting stops. From the very opening scenes it captures your attention. But, what I liked most about this movie was that you don't have to do a lot of thinking with this film and that was the beauty of those 'old westerns.' There are no multiple subplots to figure out in this movie, just one secret to be discovered and this is enough to keep you interested. It doesn't matter if your into 'Star Wars' 'Star Trek' or whatever, if you are into Sci-Fi movies, you will like this movie. So saddle up your horse, grab your guns and ride with this one. You won't be disappointed.",Serenity
884,umb69,Awesome movie,10,20 August 2005,"I saw this at a sneak preview, WHOA. Joss really outdid himself here, this movie is funny, has tons of action and has several great layered characters, oh and the special effects are pretty good too. There is even a brief intro that catches up those who haven't seen Firefly. Great movie. What I really liked about this movie is that the characters are all so colorful and textured, I believe this universe that Joss Wheedan has created could become the next big franchise like Star Trek. My recommendation is see it at least three times and take all your friends with you each time, that way we can get the trilogy made.",Serenity
885,Kromsack,Unfair comparisons,8,21 July 2006,"this is continuation of ""firefly"" a series that ended before one full season was shown, to truly appreciate the story you have should see the series which is available though most online video rentals companies. 500 years in the future Earth has been abandon and a new system has been colonized the hero Malcolm Reynolds is a war hero who has lost his way having fought for the ""browncoats"" for freedom from the rules of the ""Alliance"", only to have all his beliefs crushed when he was forced to surrender, now he captains a ship and has taken on two passengers a brother and sister who are hiding from the Alliance because River the young girl has something the Alliance needs.the most appealing feature of this film and the show is is based on it's the love that they all have for each other, the Brother who gives up his life to free his sister, the captain who learns to love and trust again. all stories can be compared to others but in this case it's the love that sets it apart from others.",Serenity
886,bheathva,I liked it but....,9,8 January 2006,"Having just finished the entire Firefly series I was looking forward to Serenity. I got the DVD and yep, it was great but..... darn, it was just too serious for me. Serenity did not seem to have the little touch of humor that Firefly did. Yes, it tied up all the loose ends but it just seemed too dark to me. Of course all of the actors did extremely well in their roles in both Firefly and Serenity. Even my spouse who is not a SciFi fan greatly enjoyed the Firefly series but she was turned off by Serenity. I particularly like Nathan but he really only had one humorous comment in the whole Serenity movie. A great addition was ""The Operative"". He was a really great villain. Look to see how he ends up. Not enough of Inara in Serenity. Joss Welden is a genius. I really enjoyed the extras on the DVD in which Joss described his work on Firefly and Serenity. I can see why this has become a cult series. I saw recently where SciFi channel was running it all day back to back. They are really missing something here. I encourage all who see Serenity to make sure they see Firefly.",Serenity
887,matrixmoonshadow666,A Perfect Oddity,10,27 March 2006,"Generally, if a series is cancelled, especially after barely one season, you will never ever see that particular universe again. 'Firefly', despite being consistently excellent quality, was cancelled. So this film should not exist - and I am extremely grateful that it does.The premise is that far in the future, humanity has colonised a solar system, comprised of the 'civilised' core worlds, and the dangerous frontier worlds. Captain Mal Reynolds, a survivor of a civil war that his side lost, makes his shady living on his ship 'Serenity', just barely keeping it and his crew together. 'Firefly' began with Mal reluctantly taking on two fugitives - the erudite doctor Simon Tam and his mentally unstable sister River Tam - and 'Serenity' continues and expands this particular storyline.This is a film that I think everyone should see. Not everyone will like it, but I think many will be changed by it. Honestly. In my opinion, 'Serenity' is perfect: it has characters that are three-dimensional, particularly the villain of the piece, The Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor), it has spaceship battles that the last three 'Star Wars' films should have had, it has humour, excellent acting, intelligence, true compassion and one of the best twists to a story I have ever seen. And it has a message. But that's my opinion, so please go see 'Serenity' for yourself - preferably after watching 'Firefly'.",Serenity
888,o-xa-na,"If you loved ""Firefly"", a TV series ended way before its time, then this is a must-see movie for you.",10,20 May 2014,"If you loved ""Firefly"", a TV series ended way before its time, then this is a must-see movie for you. I'm not sure how well people will be able to connect with the plot and the characters if they haven't watched ""Firefly"" prior to seeing this movie, so you would have to ask one of them how they felt about ""Serenity"". As a rule, I would tell everyone to watch ""Firefly"" as well, which pretty much solves the problem.The movie is pretty much a two-hour TV episode. It has all the elements we've seen on ""Firefly"": the sarcastic, witty humor, lovable characters, the seriousness, the music, the style, the world.I'm not sure how exactly the TV show and the movie connect, but River seems to have grown up some. Her behavior seems slightly different - not to mention more battle-ready. Her brother Simon looks better too, I must admit.The plot itself is well balanced, although there are slightly glitchy moments that make you feel like they don't really belong, but mostly it's smooth sailing - and action-packed dodging. I especially love it that they focused a lot on Reavers, who have always interested me.There is more action, naturally, and the graphics are beautiful, made with a bigger budget. The music is beautiful, lively and fitting. The costuming and details were good, and to sum it up: this is the movie you watch again, and again... and again.",Serenity
889,BroadhurstMonk,Imagine if Star Wars starred Han Solo and Luke was reduced to a bit part...,8,2 October 2005,"You'd probably end up with something like Serenity. Infused with a healthy dose of Cowboy Bebop and the last old John Wayne movie you watched, Serenity is in turn funny, frightening, exciting, wondrous, and just plain fun. The dialogue is witty, often hilarious (purposefully), and sounds as though it were taken from a 1940s western; the costume designs, as well, have western influences, frock coats and low-slung guns akimbo.There's more, however. This movie has a plot. This movie has three-dimensional characters. The Captain of our little band (Nathon Fillion) was a resistance fighter in a galaxy-wide revolution against The Alliance (the governmental powers that be). The revolution was crushed, and now he is reduced to petty thievery. He is not, however, a man who enjoys losing wars, and when circumstances allow him a second chance to strike at The Alliance, he is resurrected into the soldier that we all suspected was lurking below the surface.The villain (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is an Alliance assassin who is all the more terrifying because he recognizes and readily admits to the monstrosity of his actions, yet still believes those actions necessary to create ""A world without sin."" He calmly explains his point of view to his victims before dispatching them, as if he expects them to see his side of things, and die quietly. They never do, of course, which makes him disappointed, but not angry; he understands where they're coming from. Many of the people he kills he shows a genuine affection for, as if in another time and place he would like to buy them a beer. That doesn't stop him from killing them, though.The action is full of gunplay and swordplay, and (thank you Jesus!) free of the strobe-like quick cuts which have appeared in movie action in the last few years.The movie ends by resolving the problems presented in its 119 minute running time, yet leaves everything open-ended enough that a sequel is not out of the question. I, for one, hope a sequel will be made.Go see Serenity. It is the best pure adventure movie since Raiders of the Lost Ark.",Serenity

Unfortunately, i have to say that the movie was so bad, my friends and I actually left half way in, so from what i can tell you, only watching half the movie, i can honestly say, save your money because this is not worth watching. Everything about the movie lagged, the acting was horrible, i saw no big name actors in the cast, and it showed, because these people will never make it big!! The story line was horrible, special effects were horrible, everything about the movie was horrible. Granted I'm not the biggest sci-fi fan, but i did enjoy almost every starwars that came out, so I can decipher what a good sci-fi is and isn't.

891,midlife_crisis,Serenity is Much More Than a Movie,10,27 February 2006,"Serenity is much more than a movie. However, if you go into it expecting too much, you may be disappointed. As the movie's creator says in the introduction on the DVD, this is a movie without stars, based on a failed TV series. Will you be drawn in and inspired by this space-western? You will if you believe.Once or twice in a decade, a television show or movie comes along that captures the imagination in a way that causes its viewers to want to become part of it. Star Trek and the first Star Wars movie caused huge numbers of people to assimilate the language, customs and ideas of the shows, and those influences remain an active part of our culture 30 years later. If we look too critically, of course, they fall apart. But does that really matter? The growing phenomenon that is Serenity started as a TV series called Firefly. Those episodes (including two that never aired) are available on DVD, and if you have the choice, you might want to watch them first. The Firefly series establishes the characters and provides background and continuity for the movie.Part of the appeal of Serenity is the accessibility and vulnerability of the main characters. It's likely that at least one character will remind you of yourself, whether now or when you were younger and struggling to find your place in the universe. If you allow yourself to believe in Serenity, then you will understand why so many people have become passionate about this movie.",Serenity
892,annating,Decent,7,9 March 2012,"The movie captures that beautiful feeling but takes us on a ride that there's no turning back from. In my opinion, the one thing that makes for a truly GREAT movie is if you walk out of the theater a different person than when you walked in. This movie takes you on such a journey I didn't know if I would leave the theater at all. Sure the visual effects are stunning, but even the unfinished effects I saw meant nothing to me because it was the characters I cared about (and note that the digitally created ship itself is one of them, and I cared just as much for that than any of them). The humor is probably better than anything in the theaters this year, and the action is even greater. My screening actually came a week after Episode 3 was released, and I immediately washed my hands of Mr Lucas, and months later when I saw Fantastic 4... well let's not even talk about that one.This movie really does have something for everyone, and even in the core of the geek fandom, the range of people is total - men and women split it at least 50/50, uber-geeks and ""cool"" types, and a surprising amount of attractive people of all ages. Seriously though, don't trust the rants of the fans. Check out the movie for yourself. Give it an honest chance and I promise you will be taken on a journey that will turn you into a fan as well.",Serenity
893,Gregory_imdb,"It's not perfect, but it's better then most.",10,10 October 2005,"Clearly the best show-to-movie adaptation to date, and although watching the Firefly series is not necessary, it does help understand the character history and interplay.I'm not a rabid Firefly fanatic like most people leaving comments here, but I did enjoy the movie. It was refreshing to see a futuristic world that had little resemblance to Star-Trek or Star-Wars. What's unique about this movie in the Sci-Fi genera is the deeper characters and character development. Star-Wars movies have no character development and most characters are black-or-white. Star-Trek characters are all cartoon-like and don't show any of the inner-conflicts real people face. This movie is different: you believe the characters are real and you respect them and want to learn more about them.The main negative about the movie is the quantity of main characters. The TV benefited from all the characters because there was lots of time to create and define them. The movie does not have that luxury, as such, the viewer did not have enough time to assimilate everyone or learn to understand them in time. If the movie was not chained to the series, then one would probably concentrate more on the key 3 people (i.e. The doctor and River and the Captain Mal). The story itself would probably be better told from the eyes of the Doctor, since it's really his plight that brings everyone together. Learning more about his story would be more interesting then learning about Mals, which has a lot less significance to the plot.",Serenity

I was on the edge of my seat for the majority of the movie. It was very suspenseful. I was a little uncomfortable with some of the scenes and thought I was at a horror movie instead. Even though, like us all, I like my buttons pushed to a certain extent. I wish there for more of the Firefly movies as there is still are more stories to tell. I would hope other geeks will go see the movie. As an Black female in her thirties I am proud to be a sci-fi geek! We geeks have to stick together so our stories will be told.",Serenity
895,garciam44,Terrible acting - moderate special effects...,4,30 April 2012,"I watched this movie because it was rated highly - a 7.9 - on IMDb, but I was terribly disappointed. Perhaps that is why I did not enjoy it very much. Anyways, here are my thoughts:Obviously everyone who is rating this movie high is a big fan of the Firefly series. I thought the acting was terrible - although perhaps the acting was simply poor and because many of the lines were cheesy and conventional, it made the acting seem even worse. The ""landing"" scene at the beginning of the movie is a great example - no one would act so nonchalant and crack jokes if their ship was really falling apart. The arguments seemed forced and awkward and the fight scenes were over - embellished and unrealistic. The special effects were at times decent and at other times seemed very low budget. I've seen movies from the early 90s with better...The plot was okay and the initial concept of terraforming other planets is very cool - there were portions of the movie that were decent; however, the stereotypical lines and awful acting - coupled with mediocre cgi made this movie nearly unbearable times.

When I saw the trailers I knew it would be good but I didn't have the time to go see it. I was impressed with everything, the effects, the acting, the story and especially the dialog. This beats anything Lucas has put out in the last 10 years. Sorry George but sometimes the little guy can show up with less tools but more heart and show the champ a few new moves. I do hope this starts a new franchise. We need one.

I was shocked at some of the developments, (""I am a leaf on the wind"" :(), but it held true to Whedon's pattern of torturing his characters and shocking his fanbase. Long live Firefly, you CAN'T take the sky from US!I heard early on that this was going to be a trilogy, but based on early box office figures it is not doing terribly well. You need to rally all of your friends to come see this masterwork, and keep Serenity in the black.The second time I saw this movie, I timed the opening shot of the Serenity set. It is a beautiful shot, winding and twisting through the ship while introducing the characters.

Did they think we'd believe that the reavers would kill river when they dragged her from the door? The interactions between the characters is the lamest I have seen in years. The plot was the worst I have seen in years. And I don't know about where you saw this movie, but this movie was unbelievably LOUD! I think it is targeted for old people anyway. I was remarking to my friend how this movie seemed like one of those lame made for t.v. Sci-Fi movies . Then he said it was based on a T.V. show. Yea, thats right, I had heard that to. Figures.

I am glad that the story became what it did, full of surprise and rife with the emotion that drove the show. Many but not all of the questions raised were answered but many where. For those who are unfamiliar with the series, some parts may confuse you but the stroy is still far superior to this years pap. If you are looking for a family movie beware, the content is mature and my daughter (8) hid her head several times, though most of her hiding was done during the 10 - 15 minutes of previews including a graphic trailer for Saw II, no thank you.

901,Spark7,"Ugh, this movie was boring!",3,18 October 2005,"First of all, I must say that i've read plenty of reviews on this movie. I must secondly say that I have never seen a single episode of Firefly, and thus had no clue as to the basis behind the plot before I saw the movie. But either way you look at it, this movie was bad.Just because a movie is based on a TV series doesn't mean that it should only be understood by those who have watched the series. I should be able to watch a movie and be able to understand the characters inside and out, their motivations, their fears, their secrets. I saw almost little to no character development. I'm sure the characters were very fleshed out during the TV series, but that's no excuse. I should feel sad if something bad happens to a character because I feel a personal connection. These characters felt like complete strangers to me, like the people you hear about in the news. If something bad happens to them, you just shrug it off with a 'meh'.The acting was way too corny and cheesy and made the film seem more like a B movie than top 250 material. Almost everything the characters said felt contrived and unnatural, as though they were reading from a teleprompter.I don't feel like going into the plot, as i'm sure you can learn about that from all of the other praising reviews on here. But i'd like to conclude that I feel that there is only one reason this movie is on the top 250: the obsessive fans. They vote 10, they write praising reviews, they overlook all of the flaws because they've been addicted to the show. So if you know absolutely nothing about Firefly or its universe, do not watch this. It will feel cheesy, dumb, and not worth your money.",Serenity
902,splotchcat,wow,9,8 October 2005,"The title of my comment says it all. I never watched the TV series Firefly so I wasn't up to par on the story line. That doesn't really at all. The movie easily can stand alone. It is an excellent space action/adventure movie. Now if you are a fan of Buffy or Angel you will be able to tell that this movie was written by Josh Whedon, even if you didn't already know it. There is a certain style of writing that just screams this was written by Josh Whedon. Throuhout the movie there are places where you think a little bit of tension is coming but instead you get a bit of comedy. For instance when Mal asks Jayne if he wants to run the ship. Jayne says yeah. and Mal just responds ""well you can't."" An excellent movie overall.",Serenity
903,gryphon12432,One of the best movies in a long time....,10,8 October 2005,"I have no words to describe what I just saw. As Whedon's first production for the Movie Screen, it does more justice to what a movie should be than some that experienced directors have made. Despite having to make it appeal to a greater audience than when it was a brief television show, he stuck to his original ideas, and brought them forth in an amazing ending to an already epic story.Throughout the movie, you will be laughing; the dialogue is very witty and the characters feel alive. It has a darker element within it that will probably shock you at least once during the length. Finally there are very touching, very sad scenes that will make you want to cry. If no reviews have swayed you, if you are still unsure about this movie, just see it. It will cost you 10 bucks which you won't miss in the long run, and once you have, 99.9% of you will think it was more than worth it.",Serenity
904,DarthDanno,An interesting feature,8,9 October 2005,"I had never seen the show Firefly, or even known how popular it was until recently, so I was not sure what to expect from this movie. After viewing it, I am still not quite sure what to think. For one thing, I thought the characters seemed fairly well developed. For another, I thought the special effects were done very well. The action scenes did not seem like overkill, as in many movies. One thing that I liked in watching this movie was that the characters actually seemed mortal to me. Also, I thought that the oriental influence seen throughout the movie distinguished this from other films in the science fiction genre. Also it is interesting to note, this is one of the few sci-fi action films where sound is rarely heard in space (I do not believe I heard many major sounds until the end of the movie). There is another thing worth mentioning about this movie, which is the plot. I sat through the movie quite a while, worried that the plot was just flying over my head, and it was not until a while into the movie that I actually began to piece things together. Whether this fault is with the writers, or with myself, I am uncertain, but after leaving the theater, I believe that I have gained a more in-depth understanding. In conclusion, Serenity is a film that is best judged by an individual.",Serenity
905,rath1969,This is the way Firefly was supposed to be seen.,10,11 October 2005,"If you liked the short lived TV show firefly, you will love this movie. The characters that were developed by Joss in the TV show continue to make you laugh, cry and jump up and down in your seats. Even if you have not seen the TV show before this movie has well developed characters that at first glance are the same as many others, but as you get to know them they surprise you with the depth of character that they have. This is a movie that you must see if you like Sci-Fi movies at all. It brings together a mix of old western crossed with China going to outer space after the population has increased passes what the earth can hold.The use of Chinese phrases may confuse some people that have never seen the TV show, but that is from the fact that the US and China were the only super powers left when they left the planet so there was a combining of the cultures. Makes it easier to swear if it is in another language too.This movie was so good I drove 300 miles to see a sneak preview of it 3 months before it came out in theaters, saw it at midnight the opening night and again 2 days later with 12 of my friends. There is something for everyone in this movie, but I would suggest seeing at least some of the TV show first just to get a better feel for the movie.",Serenity
906,Krotos,"Decent, but hardly the next ""Star Wars""",4,11 March 2006,"The New York Times described ""Serenity"" as a ""40 million dollar B-movie,"" and I think that's pretty apt. It's entertaining, but I couldn't see why so many people were so enthralled by it. I never saw the TV series on which ""Serenity"" is based, so perhaps I'm not able to sufficiently appreciate it -- but it basically struck me as a modern version of ""Battle Beyond the Stars,"" that is, as a fun but essentially derivative sci-fi movie taking most of its inspiration from other, far more groundbreaking movies.The plot concerns the efforts of a group of space pirates to safeguard a teenage girl, River, who had been imprisoned and conditioned to be a kind of super-soldier before her brother broke her out of the government's custody. River has psychic powers, incredible combat abilities, and subconscious knowledge of a terrible secret. The pirates have two main opponents: the corrupt, fascistic Alliance government, which has sent a brutal but soulful assassin to make sure River's secret stays that way; and the zombie-like Reavers, who turn out to be connected to the secret.It's generally a well-done movie, although there were various things that confused me, which perhaps wouldn't have been the case had I seen the ""Firefly"" TV series. How did River wind up as a government project in the first place? Why were the Reavers (an unfortunate choice of name, since I often couldn't tell whether the dialogue was referring to them or to River) violent and seemingly mindless in person, yet able to pilot spaceships? How did the Parliament members whose minds River read know (apparently from the perspective of people actually present) about the events on Miranda? A little more backstory for non-""Firefly"" watchers would have been nice.The acting was all right, too, although I didn't particularly care for the actress who played River, and the captain had a faux-Southwestern accent so thick that at times I had no idea what he was saying. The special effects were believable, but then these days they always are.I'll probably see the sequel to ""Serenity"" when and if it comes out, but I won't be waiting in breathless anticipation.",Serenity
907,Shakespear_x,Beautiful !,10,23 June 2008,"It is even better the second time around... When i first saw this film i wasn't aware it was a continuation to a great mini-series, i judged it as a stand-alone title, it amused me, dazzled me, i thought it was great. Having since got acquainted with the adventures of Serenity's crew in the series, i must say i am truly amazed of the great job they did linking this film to the series, character development, acting, directing, the special effects, there is much to write about what is done right in this film, but it's best i leave you all to enjoy it in your own way. As close to flawlessness as a Sci-Fi can get. A great finale to the Firefly TV series ...and even if it all stops here, it lives on in our hearts & minds!",Serenity
908,dgraham-1,High expectations well and truly met,10,20 September 2005,"I'd been waiting to see this for so long I was definitely feeling that it had to be a let down. There was no way it could be everything I was hoping for. Every trailer for Serenity added to the hope, and the film nailed it entirely. Forget sci-fi this is action/comedy at its best, and completely accessible to non-Firefly folks. It looks amazing, and the snappy humorous dialogue is exactly what you expect from Joss. My only problem with the dialogue was trying to work out some of it then realising that, of course, I hadn't quite caught it because it was the whole cursing in mandarin thing. The best description for the tone of the movie I can come up with (other than Firefly of course) is ""Dog Soldiers"" - same kind of action flick with a great big sense of humour.It isn't epic, its not gonna change the world, but its the best two hours of film entertainment i've had in a long time.",Serenity
909,Rudest,Excellent Film,10,19 October 2005,"This is a great science fiction movie for those who liked Firefly and those who didn't. Sadly, this movie is being overlooked by many genre fans because it's not Star Wars or Star Trek. I found this fact utterly refreshing! Do not let the fact that you did not watch Firefly keep you from watching this film! There's enough background for anyone to understand what's happening. One objection I've heard is that people don't know if it's a Western or Sci-Fi. I've heard it said many times that Sci-Fi is a Western in outer space. The Firefly/Serenity 'verse has only made it a reality. The acting is excellent and it's lots of fun to watch. It's funny, it's serious, it has a great story and it can make you cry; plus it has a cool space battle. What else do you want in a science fiction film.",Serenity
910,stubbmann,Beautiful,10,6 December 2005,"Just Beautiful. that's really the only way to describe the experience of Serenity for me. Of course, it helps that i'm a huge fan of the original show, but everyone I know who hasn't seen the show and saw the movie loved it too. For those that don't know, the setting is hundreds of years in the future. Earth has been over populated, so huge colony ships set out to a new solar system, one with dozens of planets and hundreds of moons. these planets are terraformed, along with many of the moons. not too much later, however, war breaks out between the Alliance (think Galactic Empire) and the Independent planets, also known as Browncoats. The alliance eventually wins, and a central government is established. this isn't the storyline, however. the actual story is of Malcolm Reynolds, a former Browncoat, and his crew on his ship, Serenity. and if you don't want to miss out on the best movie this year, you'd better get your behind to the local cineplex and see Serenity.",Serenity
911,Tacoloft,A poorly advertised and underrated kick ass movie!,10,7 October 2005,"I predict that this, like the TV series will go unnoticed by the majority of people because Jodi Foster or some other overrated actor is not headlining it. I saw A history of violence (which was crap) and it is getting rave reviews. (How hard is it to make a steaming turd anyway? For an answer ask Cronenberg about his latest opus.) Serenity has LOVING CARE and THOUGHT oozing through the film. ""What?! We have a writer/director that likes to come up with ""original ideas""?! We can't stand for that! It's silly! I love to praise crappy movies""--so say some reviewers-If you are a snob go see A History of Violence and waste 9 bucks on something that required NO EFFORT. BUT-if you want your money to work for you-watch Serenity. This has all of my favorite genres in one movie- nuff said. ie: Star Wars mixed with Indiana Jones mixed with The Good The Bad and the Ugly, mixed with 28 days Later. .(ok Whedon borrowed some ideas-but they are great ones!)",Serenity
912,mspacmanlovers,Not So Serene,6,10 October 2005,"I have got to say that I was not all that impressed by the film. The dialogue, which had some traditional Joss one-two punches, needed some fine-tuning and all the actors mumbled their lines to the point that some of the jokes were lost in the action. The main character seemed extremely muddled for a Hans Solo homage. For example, he has to state that the cause of disclosing the truth to the galaxy was a belief for him that was worth dying for. Obviously, this statement was meant to showcase his transitional character growth, but it doesn't work. Where in the rest of the film was it clear that he wasn't the type of person that would commit to a cause? If the answer is ""in the short lived and failed television series"" than it is a bit short sighted of the creator to assume that would be all the set-up he needed. To me, Mal always did seem to be a maverick of missions.Joss short changes himself in the directing department also. Several times the angles he chose and failed to choose undermined the significance of a scene. For example, the mutiny-like confrontation around the table midpoint in the movie got too caught up on figuring out how he was going to get every character on screen by attempting various camera angles. The audience shouldn't see a director struggle through a scene. Another example is at the end when River appears to sacrifice herself in a Matrix meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer one woman showdown, a motif that Whedon has single handedly beat to death, against a horde of baddies is delivered badly. The scene is meant to set up a kick-ass pay-off of a shot of River at the end, so Whedon had a couple choices of how to pack in the best results. First, he could have made sure that the fight was mind-blowing cool. He didn't. In fact, it seemed as if he really wanted to show the fight but didn't really know how by the way he would only show small clips of the fight at a time. This approach only gave the audience a false sense of suspense, not a true one. The cheesy fighting techniques of River may have worked for Buffy in a Fox channel television series, but it comes across as a bit too campy on the big screen. If a director wishes to show an amazing fight scene then a simple rule applies: he must deliver an amazing fight scene. The second method he failed to choose (the one I would have preferred) is that he left it up to us to imagine River's survival. Imagine she flips into the room and, still in a crouched position as the doors behind her seal shut, we, the audience, sees the horde of creatures descend down on her. Next, time is spent altering attention between Mal's fight and the struggling survival of the remaining crew members. After those two scenes have climaxed then have the doors unseal and reveal her pose. It would have been far more powerful.The cuts to other scenes throughout the film didn't always make sense and was a bit cumbersome in delivery. Perhaps it would have been smoother if Whedon had the saving grace of a Coke commercial between scenes.In the end, the film is very hit and miss. This is a Joss Whedon work so there is certainly some hits. His wit, when it isn't too garbled, will make you laugh, and a purposeful break in dialogue beat will remind people why Joss Whedon has a cult following.I imagine that the cult-like following of his work is really why reviews have so often compared it to the episodes one through three of Star Wars (although, as you may notice, never to the original three films in which he clearly drew inspiration. A dirty alien bar. Space gunslinger. Dangerous discussion at a small round table in the back. Violence. Enough said.). The comparisons baffle me a little because, is there anyone that actually believed that the new Star Wars films were good?",Serenity
913,deadthings,Amazing,10,2 October 2005,"Oh Serenity....This movie got right what so many get wrong. It was a big fun action movie, but it was smart. It was a PG-13 film, but it went to darker places than most PG-13 horror films wouldn't dare. It also has some of the most endearing characters you're likely to see in a film; Funny, interesting, haunted, complicated, and sometimes really goofy. Just like real people, only a little cooler. And for all of Serenity's bleak, and very emotional moments, there's just as many Hilarious, and Exciting ones.It's all of this and so much more. Great Heroes, Great Villain, Terrifying Monsters, etc. And all balanced so well, paced so well....Side note Nathan Fillion is Brilliant. So is the rest of the cast, but he's my hero.Now, I might be biased. I did just watch the DVD of Firefly and loved it, but, my sister-in-law that watched it with us knew nothing of the show going in, and had about the same reaction as my wife and me. We all loved it. And I, being a fan of the show I was afraid the film might come of as weak, or like a recap of the show or like one of the bad Star Treks. Instead, I got an amazing film.Thank you Joss Whedon.",Serenity

915,GVH0,Joss Whedon works his magic and succeeds wonderfully!,10,21 August 2005,"Before you start reading this, you have to know where I'm coming from. I'm a huge fan of Joss Whedon's work, was a loyal follower of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and 'Angel' and really got into 'Firefly' (on which this movie is based) and the whole browncoat phenomenon as well. So I was, you might just say, pretty much predestined to like this movie. But, not so. Whedon-fans are a pretty critical bunch, most of the time, and no one went into this thing with higher expectations than us. And to have those expectations be met in such a way as Serenity does, is very special indeed.The movie itself has all the elements that make Joss Whedon's work so very unique. The sense of humor, the wonderfully realized characters and their strong interpersonal bonds, masterful dialogue and emotional pain, everything is present. I laughed, I cried, I pretty much went through the entire emotional spectrum watching this movie, and that's not something you might expect from 'just another sci-fi movie'.While I'm writing this, the release of Serenity is still a few weeks ahead, but I got to see the finished version of the movie with a selected group of Dutch Firefly fans in an exclusive pre-screening. Afterwards, the atmosphere was strange, subdued. It was almost as if everyone had survived some kind of big disaster together and we were too stunned to really say much. And I say that in the kindest possible way. Honestly.If you're not into Whedon's work, or even if you're not into sci-fi in general, this is gonna be a movie worth watching. Ignore the whole 'geekmovie' hype that'll undoubtedly surround the release. Ignore the hype created by Whedon-fans such as myself. Simply go see it with an open mind and be prepared to be blown away. Because when Whedon works his magic, everyone has to pay attention.This movie is truly a leaf on the wind. Watch it soar!",Serenity
916,steve-1572,Buh.Buh.Buh.,10,6 October 2005,"Buh.Buh.Buh. I am still in shock. This was by far the best Sci-Fi movie I have ever had chance to see on the Big Screen. I will keep this version of the review spoiler free. But I will also post a version with spoilers.For those who don't know, this movie is based on the short-lived TV show ""Firefly"" that was canceled after only 13 episodes. (Though only seven were ever shown in it original run on Fox) The movie is set in the future after all of Earth's natural resources have been used up and the human race has moved out to a new solar system, where they were able to terraform dozens of planets to make them habitable.Once all the words had been colonized, the inner worlds (the ones with all the technology) of the new solar system decided that all the planets should be under the rule of one government they call the Alliance. The outer worlds (worlds who have to survive with the most basic tech only) did not agree and it erupted into a Civil war. The Alliance on one side and the Brown Coats on the other.The Alliance eventually won at the battle of Serenity Valley (where the ship gets its name) and expanded their influence over all the worlds. The Serenity's captain and second-in-command are saviors of the losing side in the war.The name of the movie ""Serenity"" comes from the name of a dilapidated and barely functioning transport ship that constantly is breaking down and only is kept flying by the skill of the ship's engineer Kaylee (Jewel Staite).Along their travels they picked up a brother and sister on the run from the Alliance. The brother is a gifted doctor (Simon Tam - Sean Maher) who gave up everything he had to rescue his sister from an Alliance laboratory facility.Once he rescued his sister he found out the Alliance had performed many different experiments on her. This turned her from an innocent child into a troubled mental patient with telekinetic abilities.The movie follows the attempt for the Alliance to recapture River.The movie is incredible. The effects were extremely well done. This is by far the best Sci-Fi movie I have ever seen.All I can say is ""Joss Whedon is my master now!!!""",Serenity
917,neotom52345,Totally unbiased comment,9,3 December 2005,"I went in to this movie with no previous knowledge of any of Joss Whedon's works, so understand that I am not obligated to say that the movie was great simply because I am a fan. That said I thought the movie was great. The premise is quite original, mixing sci-fi and western, and it works great. At parts it's quite a funny movie, but it does have serious bits strewn throughout also. You don't have to have previously been a fan of ""Firefly"" (the canceled show this was based off of) to fully understand it, so don't let that turn you off. But for fans of the show (most of whom have probably seen it anyway), it does not disappoint. If you enjoy the movie I also recommend watching ""Firefly"" which is out on DVD and occasionally airs on Sci-Fi network.",Serenity
918,lunchboxbabe,Spoiler!!!,10,3 October 2005,"THE FOLLOWING IS A SPOILER TO THE MOVIE-IF YOU Haven't SEEN IT-Don't READ IT! OK ...the thing is that this movie was awesome and it was sad that Shepherd died. boo hoo. anywho, my friend cried when Wash died. it was so unexpected and shocking--as much as i hated Joss for doing that--i think i respect him more now. kaylee's line about not having anything betwixt her legs that didn't run on batteries was Hilarious...i was surrounded by a group of guys who were wondering why i was laughing.the thing about the movie that i was most proud of, however was the fact that it wasn't just a 2 hour episode.

919,mooniniteignignokt,my first introduction to firefly and it got me hooked,10,31 August 2005,"I had never even heard of the show Firefly when my friend dragged me along to the pre-screening of this film. I had no idea what to expect. All she said was that it had something to do with space cowboys and that it was sci-fi.While I watched the film, I found myself so attached to the characters that everything that happened to them actually mattered to me. Sci-fi and action movies often rely on the adventure aspect to carry it but Serenity actually had me loving the people in it. I wanted more when I got out of that theater. I was amazed by the wit and very happy with the plot (that has more than a couple twists that you won't be expecting). I was hooked and I couldn't stop thinking about it.Since then, I've watched the entire series and loved all of it, but in the end, I think Serenity leaves it in the dust.",Serenity
920,moonsaber,What I expected,10,2 October 2005,"Quirky humor, social impact, fights, death, honest humanity and slapstick comedy and corny action... all in a fast moving piece of eye candy. It wasn't perfect, but what ever is, it was simply what I wanted out of a film based on the show Firefly, and for pleasing me greatly, I give it the full 10 and my hearty support.If you haven't seen the show Firefly, then this might lose you. A great injustice was done that show when it originally aired, and I was incredibly surprised that someone managed to swing a movie of it anyway, and (dare I be repetitive) was greatly pleased with the result.The complete original cast was returned, looking much the same (but is it me.. or does 'Kaylee' seem to be MUCH fitter. It's not quite the same continuity as the TV show, since one character that died there is in the movie.. and funny as hell, as usual, glad to have.. ummm.. that person. And another dies.. a different one. The plot at times is transparent, but regardless a good ride, I highly recommend it to sci fi buffs and those who enjoyed the TV series, and to anyone else that might enjoy a good little intelligent action yarn.",Serenity
921,hydra9,Watch 'Firefly' first! It makes such a difference!,10,12 January 2007,"I first watched Serenity when it came out at theaters. I hadn't seen the Firefly TV show, and I normally *never* watch sequels if I haven't seen the original. But in this case, I only had mild interest in the film, and had no interest in seeing the TV show. Plus I was sure that knowledge of Firefly would not be essential in appreciating Serenity. So I figured: Why not?So... I watched Serenity. And my opinion? It was *okay*. Sort of average (5 or 6 out of 10, I guess). I didn't think much of the characters, the dialog or the humor. I laughed maybe twice, but most of the jokes just annoyed me. I thought the plot and the way events played out were pretty standard.Then a friend of mine watched Firefly. He loved it and told me I *had* to see it. I ignored him.But, he kept on. And then I saw that the DVD box set was pretty cheap. I grudgingly gave it a try.... WOW! The first episode of Firefly blew me away. As did the rest of the season. I became a fan overnight. That first episode alone was enough for me to think: This is the best show I've ever seen.Last night, I watched Serenity again. What a difference! This time, I knew the characters, and loved 'em. I cared about what happened to them. I appreciated Mr. Whedon's sense of humour. And I *loved* the movie this time around! It's not perfect, some parts of it are somewhat 'standard,' some action scenes could be shorter or better put together... but gorrammit - I *cried* twice during it! Which NEVER happens! And I laughed my rear off on numerous occasions! I know I sound like a religious fanatic. And I guess I am. But when I started watching Firefly, I saw the light. The idea of 'Cowboys In Space' didn't really appeal to me, but watching the show, the fanboy enthusiasm suddenly made perfect sense.The thing is: This film/show/story is all about the characters. It's notoriously hard to give the viewer a set of well-rounded characters they really care about within the confines of a 2 hour movie. And for me, Serenity didn't manage it. So I would say that's a failing of the movie.However, there's an easy solution! Yep, watch Firefly first. Then you know the characters. Then there's no problem! It's what totally changed my mind and turned an honestly pretty boring 5 out of 10 movie into... a 10 out of 10 masterpiece. Now I want more!",Serenity
922,harisudan1,Spectacular,10,3 October 2005,"Words cannot express how much I enjoyed this movie, as a Firefly fan, I do not believe that Joss Whedon and the cast of Serenity could have done anything better! When I left the theater, I felt elated. If you are a fan, watch it! If you have not watched the series, go see the movie and when your appetite is whetted, go get the series and watch it too! I truly believe that Joss Whedon is a genius and I hope and pray that not only will we get the Serenity trilogy that he has talked about, but also that some Network exec will have enough testicular fortitude to put Firefly back on the air! I feel that the crew of Serenity is like a family and that I would give anything to be a part of that family. The movie is packed with action, but also delves deeper into the characters, Mal especially, it lets you see a darker side of Mal than the series portrayed.",Serenity
923,platinum_mongoose,Can't take the sky....,10,3 November 2005,"The original Star Wars trilogy have been my favorite movies since I was four years old. For the first time in fourteen years, that has changed. If I could only say one thing about Serenity, that would be it. That Serenity is the next logical step up from the greatness that is Star Wars. Fortunately, I'm not limited to only one thing, right? So here goes: Joss Whedon is my personal hero. He is as brilliant a writer as he is a director. He created a realistic, gritty vision of the future vastly superior to that of Alien or Blade Runner. The blending of Sci-Fi and Western is inspired, and it reminds us of the gunslinging, frontier settings of Star Wars, Farscape, and Tombstone all melded into one. Without aliens, too, which is refreshing as hell in today's world of cgi and latex. As for the cast, all I can say is that they really shouldn't be this unknown. They're spectacular together. While this was more apparent in Firefly the series, that same love and camaraderie carries over into the movie as well as it could fit into a mere 2 hours--far less than they deserve. And on a final note (with oh-so-minor spoilers), I'd like to talk for a moment about the villain of the piece: The Operative. I don't see many movies where the villain is generally a better person than the hero. Mal is crude and headstrong, and the Operative is cool, collected, and polite. He does not throw his head back and laugh maniacally, or sentence the heroes to slow, easily-escaped fates. He offers multiple times to resolve their differences peacefully, and Mal responds to those offers by shooting him in cold blood. (Good thing for body armor!) So there's my 2 cents. The movie didn't do so well at the box office, and I'd really like to see a sequel. Rent or borrow the DVD. (Firefly, too!) If you like it, buy a copy of your own, and spread the word like I have. If you don't like it, I'm sorry, and please, *please* don't become one of the many trolls who seem intent on filling Serenity message boards with hate. Because the truth is that this world deserves more. There are still things from the series that fans like me want to know. You can't stop the signal.",Serenity
924,random_data,Scifi love?,10,2 October 2005,"I'd heard of Firefly and Joss Whedon before this summer, mainly because of Buffy and Angel. I rented season 4 of Angel and completely fell in love. Now, to be honest, I'm a scifi nerd by adoption. Inducted into the club by Stargate and tied closer to the genre by Farscape and Battlestar Galactica, I was ready for more. On a stroke of luck, a friend bought me the entire series of Firefly and I, starved for more information about Serenity, watched like a newly changed anorexic eats at her first meal out of rehab. My first thought after watching the first episode was just ""OMGZ THAT WAS AMAZING!"" (I have a one track mind.) I became addicted to the actors' faces and the characters' personalities; to make a long story short (too late), I fell in love. If you treat Serenity and her crew right by not snubbing her, you will too.Joss Whedon is a deity by right with the way he mixes words, emotions, everything that makes movies into worshiped golden idols. Even not having seen the show, the first ten minutes will tell you all you need to know, and you don't even have to be a fan of scifi to be interested. Joss knows what people want to see, something different than that chick flick in the next theater, or the blow-'em-up pissing match for guys in the theater next to that. Serenity takes those stereotypical elements and turns them into a work of art, next to some of the movies i've seen. So, if you're looking for something different, something to fall in love with, Serenity is the movie to see. Take your friends, and make them fall in love too.I dare you.",Serenity

Truth be known, I went in to see this movie thinking ""Hey, at the very least, it will have spaceships"". Little did I know that I would end up watching one of the most engaging films from 2005. The action may have been a little sketchy, but the humor and humanity of the characters really helps this movie flow. I got hooked on their witty banter, candid flaws and insurmountable spirit. Captain Mal is not perfect, but that's what makes him believable. If you are a sci-fi fan, or even a fan of some of the old spaghetti westerns, take the time to see this film. It has the heart so many films these days lack.",Serenity

At the end of the movie I literally wondered if I had watched the same movie everyone was getting misty-eyed over.In a nutshell: acting that ranges from wooden to disinterested, a storyline and payoff that is anticlimactic to say the least, and -- the mortal sin for any sci-fi story -- not an original idea to be found from beginning to end. I should've known by the all the Buffy lovers waxing lyrical about this to stay away... I would've had more fun watching C-SPAN hearings.",Serenity
927,shaggy90004,A fan's review=minor spoilers.,8,3 October 2005,"OK first of all I am a major fan of the t.v. show. However there were some small things that disappointed me about the movie. 1.) I felt the comedic dialog between characters, which was a strong point of the show for me, was close to non-existent in the movie.2.) A couple of the characters were slightly altered, personality wise, during the transition from the t.v. show to the big screen.a.)Jayne Cobb= In the t.v. show he is the muscle of the team. He is big, strong, will whoop @$$, and is a dumb redneck. In the movie he is still the muscle of the team, however he is not so redneckish and probably 20x brighter(therefore losing much of the humor).b.)Capt. Mal Reynolds= in the t.v. show he was the war vet. who is hard as steel, while still being a teddy bear, a tortured soul consistently fighting an ongoing personal battle yet a strong leader with a sense of humor. In the movie it felt more like a stressed out captain who's rope was running out with no other options available for the first 2/3 of the movie, and then like the good old Mal for the final 1/3. This was of course do to the story and how it twists throughout, but I still didn't like it. 3.) For a final note. The way it was filmed at parts. It would keep one consistent camera view without switching. For example following Mal as he walks through many of the different rooms on the ship. Or the shakiness of some of the shots. Another one of the best parts of the show are the artistic and unconventional camera angels.Finally this is just my opinion of the movie. The things I have listed are things that I found most enjoyable about the show that I felt the movie lacked. Of course these are my nit-picky things, and that not every body loved the show for the same reasons. OK OK FINAL FINAL NOTE NO REALLY THIS TIME: In the show Shepard Book received Medical Attention from the Alliance, because of his IDENT CARD. In the end of the episode Mal asked him to explain and he said he couldn't, but he hoped he could 1 day. I was really really really hoping they would include this in the movie. It was disappointing they didn't have it in the movie, but instead referred to him in a similar manner which he didn't answer either leaving more questions. OK OK OK FINAL FINAL FINAL FINAL NOTE REALLY Truly THIS TIME: Well another prob.... J/K Peace.",Serenity
928,kellyo73,Great film without having watched Firefly,9,24 January 2007,As there are so many comments for this film a synopsis by me isn't really needed so I will just say I never really got into Buffy and didn't know Firefly existed but Serenity has become one of my all time favourite films. I don't actually buy many DVD's but I own this one because it is one of those movies that is a keeper. Chiwetel Ejiofor as The Operative is quietly menacing and having seen him since in other movies 'Kinkyboots' and more recently 'Children of Men' he is a very good actor. I try to tell as many people as I can about Serenity it when the question of good movies you have seen comes up!,Serenity
929,wavyfrog,not just for the rabid fans,10,4 October 2005,"As a Joss Whedon fan, in general, I was excited to see this movie. However, I was suspicious from the beginning. ""Firefly"" had never really gelled with me; I only watched a few episodes of the series. So, no, I was not part of the Browncoat fan base. That being said, I still wanted to see the movie enough to convince my two middle-aged parents to go see the movie with me while I was home from college. I figured that my father , who generally likes sci-fi and westerns, would at least like it. But I had no idea that my mother, whose favorite movie is ""the Piano,"" would like it so much. In fact they both loved ""Serenity."" For days after seeing it, they kept bringing up the movie.""Those characters were so well done."" ""That was great writing. Really great writing."" ""I can't believe how real the characters were."" ""I just can't get over that movie."" ""Thank you so much for taking us to that.""They're words speak better than mine.But I'll try anyway: See this movie. The good reviews are warranted.",Serenity
930,yt13,Not as good as the pilot episode of Firefly,7,1 October 2005,"I'm a Firefly fan so, can't really say how this movie works for folks who haven't seen Firefly. Those that have should go into it knowing that this is an action movie.It isn't as good as the pilot episode of Firefly, which is where the characters and back-story were created. Both were written & directed by Joss Whedon. The TV pilot had a budget of US$12million, a 21 day shooting schedule, and is 88 minutes long. The movie budget has been reported as US$40million, was shot over the summer, and is 119 minutes long.The first thing I loved about the pilot of the TV series is that it depicted space & motion more accurately than anything else since 2001: a Space Odyssey. The movie doesn't. Admittedly, some episodes of Firefly didn't either, but those directed by Joss Whedon did.I also loved Greg Edmonson's music in the series, and the movie soundtrack (by David Newman) is quite different. Perhaps I prefer the music in Firefly because it's familiar, but there are a couple of anthems in the movie that seem out of place, and distracted me from the story. These may turn out to be the most beautiful tracks on the soundtrack album, but they seem composed more for that than to fit into the movie itself.Firefly used deep focus in most live action shots, and incorporated zooms & whip-pans in its digital special effects to make it feel like they were captured by hand-held camera. The former is difficult, while the latter is original. I noticed neither of these techniques in the movie. Visually, the movie looks rather ordinary.Fans of Firefly may have heard that the Captain, Malcolm Reynolds, is a darker character in the movie. I thought all the male characters talked, behaved & related differently than they did in the series. If you haven't seen Firefly (but are still reading this review anyway), this shouldn't matter to you at all.And now, to the story itself. For a few seconds (starting from the Universal logo) the movie shows the beginning of the back-story, but it quickly devolves to explaining most of it. In a visual medium, showing is better than explaining, unless part of what's shown is the physical reality of the setting, and the physics doesn't make sense. The movie would be improved without that map. If you've seen any of the trailers, you know there's a bank heist, a fight scene, and a big space battle. There's also a bigger, deadlier, fight starring River, and a man-to-man fight between Captain Mal and the Operative (Bad Guy). With suitable change of actors & costumes, any of these scenes could be swapped with dozens of other movies.The pilot episode of Firefly was like an independent movie, in budget, shooting schedule, and result. It was strikingly, refreshingly original, in style & story. Yet it managed to show the viewer a detailed, natural introduction to the ship and its nine passengers and crew, and bring them together through three separate threats in a thrilling, extended climax.Serenity isn't a bad movie. I give it 7 stars, and may go see it at the cinema again, in different company. But it doesn't distinguish itself, and I expected so much more from the same guy who wrote & directed the pilot episode of Firefly.",Serenity
931,gedwards-5,Best ever? No. Better than Star Wars? Ruttin' A!,9,6 October 2005,"Okay, I'm a Browncoat; I saw the series eagerly from the first episode aired by FOX, and despite that, I still was hooked on the show.""Serenity"" is everything the series was and more, and more importantly, it's everything a movie should be, as well. Even though the characters may not be as fully-drawn as they were in the series, they are still much more complex and realized than most genre films manage, especially several of the most recent ones from acclaimed directors and stars. The movie is fast-paced where it needs to be, takes the time to focus on the characters and their circumstances when it's appropriate, mixes humor and tension both deftly and surprisingly, and looks every bit as good as any movie out there. It's far from a simple ""big-screen television episode,"" and the story itself is far less simplistic than a cursory glance at a synopsis might make it appear.Even though the film has a relatively-low production budget, Joss Whedon and his crew managed to get the most for their money, producing a visually-slick film that needs to make no apologies whatsoever, and can stand up against visual-effects blockbusters on every technical level - quality is not simply quantity, and the CGI isn't there simply to distract the audience from a substandard script or poor performances. Every bit of visual work integrates with the look of the live action cinematography, and advances the storyline.Joss Whedon's script also gives all of the actors real substance for their characters, and their performances are first-rate to a one, even those who have relatively little screen time. His villainous Operative is no mustache-twirling caricature, nor is he a man who is as robotic in the flesh as he ever was once encased in armor; he is intelligent, motivated, and firmly believes he is working for the good of all, making him, if not charming, then dangerously magnetic. And he is ably matched by Capt. Mal Reynolds, the man who lost everything but his will to survive and his determination to keep the freedom that his society tried to take from him at gunpoint; Nathan Fillion is superb at treading the line between humorous and grim, between noble and threatening, and even when he seems to set himself up against his own crew, there's still no doubt that he is the man to lead the fight.The only complaint this reviewer has about the film is the overuse of close-ups for many of the character moments, and the occasional extreme framing that puts the action at the opposite edges of the screen, making it difficult to take everything in at once. The dialogue, much of it tinged with a pseudo-Western twang and often peppered with an earthy dialect, is snappy and smart, delivered naturally by everyone here (as it should be, since they had a half-season on the air to practice!), and the action never overshadows the message of personal freedom and the potential for even well-meaning governments to corrupt that freedom under the guise of security. A great film!",Serenity
932,mjkira_1987,Fantastic movie!,10,1 October 2005,"I was never much of a ""Firefly"" fan. I watched an episode or two because I loved ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"" and knew that Joss Whedon was a wonderful writer/director, but I just couldn't get into it. Originally, I hadn't planned on seeing the movie when it came out, but after seeing the trailer, I changed my mind. I'm very glad that I did.Joss Whedon is truly gifted. He is so witty and real in his writing. There are some great one liners in the film, as well as moments that will have you sobbing into your popcorn, and who could forget the expertly choreographed fight sequences. The entire original cast is back, and each actor fits their role perfectly. Special props to Nathan Fillion as Malcolm and Alan Tudyk as the hilarious Wash.I hope this film does well in the box office. Joss deserves a hit, and this very worthy franchise deserves a sequel.",Serenity
933,FaLLeN_AnGeL189,Can't Stop The Signal,10,8 July 2006,"This 'verse created by the one and only magnificent Joss Whedon was not only the single most superb TV show on the air ever to be canceled but worked fantastically on film. All nine crew of Serenity are in this adaptation, bringing the ship to the big screen; with the help of the words by Joss, life is breathed back into this little jewel and the engine is ignited once more. This film is beautifully written and directed along with the best known cast in the 'verse. The special effects are stunning and the acting is even better. If you're gonna see one movie this year- see SERENITY!! It'll blow your mind. Once your on Serenity you'll never leave.Can't Stop The Signal...",Serenity
934,klakatz,The future is worth fighting for!,10,17 August 2005,"I went to this movie with very high expectations, and they were met and surpassed. I don't believe I have ever had such expectations and had them met like that. I left the theater drained, exhausted, exhilarated. I have never felt this way after a film. I hope its this way for the new viewer. I can't think it will be quite as draining, but I hope the emotions are roused. And people leave with something special. I know I did. This film has it all. The most believable dialog, a cast you will fall in love with. And even though it is far from a comedy, it will make you laugh out loud. Then there is the plot and action. Now folks, you do have to pay attention, but you will be rewarded if you do. This is not written for the weak at heart. If you want mindless entertainment you are in the wrong spot. Mr. Whedon proves you can have space ships, gun fights, and a plot!!! Even a message for the people and the fans. I saw the version that did not have completed special effects and it did not detract at all. Same with the soundtrack, and with the emotions that just the dialog, action and filler soundtrack brought out. Well once we have a soundtrack, it will be even unbelievable. Its not a pretty future, but there is hope, and it is believable. Joss Whedon took me out of the theater and put me on the crew of Serenity for 2 hours. I felt their fear, pain, love, shock and elation. I truly was not cognizant of my surroundings. I had one of the Stars of the film sitting about 10 feet behind me during my screening. I forgot he was there within 10 minutes. And I really planned on watching Adam Baldwin's reactions. And just to comment on the acting job of our big heroes. Well, as the fans all know it was superlative. But, if you are not familiar with the Firefly 'verse (go buy or rent the dvds!), I feel, top honors go to Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres and Summer Glau. Again, all actors did a wonderful job, I would give Oscars to all. But those three had the meatiest material and were able to emote, without going over the top. Gina's portrayal of a Soldier woman was spot on. Nathan, brought all the anguish of the loss of the browncoats, to his future fight for survival, his care for his ship and crew and his need to do the right thing. Summer just brought a vulnerability to her character, that could have been a one note character, with a lesser actress, or script. The love of the cast for this project and each other was not just acting, it shown through and gives this film something special. If this does not get Joss Whedon and family some major scifi recognition, then I am giving up on scif!!! I know it is too much to ask the academy to accept a scifi film for best movie, or director, or script. But this is Oscar worthy material folks. Not just for Joss, but many members of the cast deserve the little statue. I would give them to all if I could. Jewel, Sean, Adam, Morena, Alan and Ron gave stellar performances, they just didn't have as much air time this time. But when we get our next movie, all bets are off. I also got to see the finished version at comic con, even better!! The soundtrack added a lot. No major changes, just some tweaks. Loved it even more.",Serenity
935,jhereg-1,"Good, But Disappointing",6,8 January 2007,"I had never seen Firefly prior to this Christmas, when I received both the series and Serenity on DVD. Fortunately, I was warned which to watch first, and I really enjoyed the TV series. While it was choppy in places, it showed real potential and it was pretty clear it would have developed into a pretty good show if it had been given the chance. So when I popped Serenity into the DVD player, I was expecting a pretty good ride.While Serenity isn't a bad movie by any means, after the series it was pretty disappointing. It seems that Whedon had some pretty interesting ideas to fill a three to five year arc on Firefly. Unfortunately, he tried to cram almost all of them into a single two-hour movie, with predictable results. The revelations come at you so fast there's no time to absorb anything before the next surprise arrives. Without that time, the revelations are no longer shocking because your senses are numbed by the frenetic pace of the film.It didn't help that a number of the characters seemed to have changed markedly from the show to the movie. That's not overly surprising given the time that had passed from the end of the series to the movie, but it was rather jarring to see characters you'd learned to love watching the show suddenly act very differently. One of the strongest moments in the show came when the crew had to go into battle to rescue the captain, and while they all did their best, the inexperience of many of them in combat was evident and very realistic. Now in Serenity, even the companion is suddenly a steely-eyed killer? Worse was the decision to kill off Shepherd Book and Wash. Book had a lot of secrets that the show had only begun to explore, but in Serenity he's little more than a cameo and a cheap tear-jerker (if you've watched the show, that is; if your only exposure is to the movie, the death of Book is unlikely to mean much to you). And Wash was the glue that held the ship together in many ways. To kill him off was so upsetting it really hurt the movie to me, and I tend to agree with the reviewer who observed it might have been better not to have seen Serenity so you could imagine the crew still enjoying their adventures together.But what ultimately prevented the film from breaking out was the thinness of the central plot. Between the series and the film, the Alliance has killed at least a few hundred people trying to recapture River. And we find out it's because the planet Miranda was wiped out by use of the 'Pax' drug? Sure, that was a terrible thing, but what's really going to happen when it gets out? The people aren't going to overthrow the government. At most a few people will be scandalized. The idea that was enough to motivate the (oddly missing) blue glove men and the Operative to kill hundreds or thousands simply wasn't believable. During the show, we see the blue glove men murder Alliance agents because they spoke to River. The secret needed to be a bit more horrific than a botched experiment, at least for my money.Overall, Serenity wasn't a bad film, particularly if you hadn't seen Firefly. But fans would have been better off if Whedon hadn't tried to wrap everything up in one film.",Serenity
936,Cynda-Tachi,a great movie,10,26 February 2006,"i believe that this film was one of the greatest things i have ever seen.The fact that a film, with not a very large budget, managed to create such an amazing film is a sign of a great director, and potential for many actors.i had not seen the series before this film, i have heard people complain that it is apparently ""impossible"" to understand if you have not watched the series. i do not think so, i understood it quite well. the people who didn't understand i think just did not pay much attention.as such, i have now seen the series and now, i believe i truly am a brown coat. and i love it.",Serenity
937,sorrowfool,Surprisingly Good,9,3 October 2005,"I am surprised how much I liked this movie. I was never a fan of Firefly... actually, I never watched an episode. I went in to the theater expecting the same old sci-fi story and action. But the story was good, the characters were great, and it had some really good action scenes. The snappy one-liner comments made by the characters actually made me laugh at times, and the movie had its humorous moments while not detracting from the intensity of the movie. It really made me want to watch the show because the characters were very interesting to me.I've never felt the urge to come on here and post a comment on a movie, but I have the feeling this movie will slip beneath the cracks and not get the attention it deserves. I would recommend, if you like the Sci-fi genre at all, you watch this movie. Even if you don't the characters in the movie should be enough for most people to enjoy the movie with little effort. Most definitely in my Top 5 movies of 2005. And River is effin' awesome.",Serenity
938,atross01,Remarkable and Original,10,2 October 2005,"I have watched Joss Whedon with interest over his career. He has grown incredibly as a writer since his first disaster of a movie, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" Then to watch him as he developed and wrote the ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"" TV shows, and then to arrive at ""Firefly"" and now Serenity. He has made an amazing comeback since his ""Buffy"" movie.I have only recently gotten interested in ""Firefly,"" the short-lived TV show that Serenity is based on. Like millions of others, I immediately fell in love with it. Whedon's work is so fresh and full of energy. He instinctively knows how to be original, yet use clichés and then shatter them into pieces.Serenity is no exception. You can tell that Whedon had a blast writing it, and the cast had a blast acting it out. It is one of the most powerful, innovative, invigorating, thrilling, and original films I have seen all year, or possibly ever. I thought Star Wars III was powerful, but Serenity leaves it in the dust in nearly every area except special effects. In fact, Serenity outstrips nearly all other sci-fi movies and shows I'm aware of.It may even give ""Lord of the Rings"" a run for its money in terms of sheer energy, passion, and intensity. It conjures up such emotion in the viewer. At times I found myself trying not to shout, cry, cringe, laugh, or gasp in surprise. Serenity is a complete triumph of storytelling on every level. It flows like a poem, beautifully written and filmed, shinning like a beacon in the darkness, an example of movie-making as it should be. I say this not as a fan, but as a writer and filmmaker hopeful who appreciates sterling character and story development.The performances in Serenity are wonderful. The actors truly take on their characters and deliver their lines convincingly and with energetic liveliness and wit. David Newman gives us a thrilling musical score which combines huge orchestral sci-fi sound with the ""wild west"" thematic elements that you expect from the ""Firefly"" show.Serenity is supposed to be the first film in a new trilogy. I hope that it does well, so we can finally see the completion of the story.All around, a genuinely human science fiction movie. It is not like most sci-fi films, which are all flash and no substance. Serenity is different. It's about the people and their interactions, not grand images of space, explosions, and epic star fighter battles (though these it has). It is a powerful human drama that is surprisingly realistic in its depiction of life in space. Whedon finds a good balance between realism and the fantastic, and in the middle of it all we find real people with real struggles. And that's the beauty. That's the Serenity.",Serenity
939,mattallica007,amazing,10,30 November 2005,"This movie is a perfect continuation of the fantastic series ""Firefly"". It is also a fantastic opportunity for a larger audience to see just how brilliant the show is, and hopefully it will lead them to buying the DVD set of the show and fingers crossed lead to the show being resurrected. (here's hoping).The writing is what you would expect from Joss Whedon, Sharp and quick witted with a range of emotion, his directing is equally brilliant. The acting is on top form also with Nathan Fillion in particular playing Captain Malcolm Reynolds in what should be a career kick starter for him.To put it quite simply, if you have not guessed by my comments so far, this film is most likely one of the top three films of the year and maybe the best science fiction film of the past ten years.",Serenity
940,vwluke,Best movie I've seen this year,10,9 October 2005,"I admit to being one of those few fans that managed to see the episodes when they were originally aired despite the many times Fox changed the schedule. I was very inclined to enjoy this movie.This is the fourth resurrection I've been a witness to. The first was Star Trek the Motionless Picture where I came away from the theater with great sadness that the magic was gone from Star Trek (I was wrong but it took The Wrath of Khan to change my mind). The second was Alien Nation after it was canceled and revived as a series of made for TV movies. I was glad that they were able to finish the cliffhanger but they never did explain how the little girl turned into a teenager after she got sick (They could have done so easily and they just ignored it)but it was never as good as a Movie series. The third was Farscape which felt too rushed and was not as good as some of its regular episodes. Finally we have Firefly/Serenity which to my eyes was nearly flawless. This is the way to do it. I loved the characters, the story, and of course the witty dialog. I intend to buy more tickets.",Serenity
941,gabriella-c,Amazing move to the big screen,10,1 October 2005,"I am stunned with Serenity in movie-form. I went in hoping it would be good. Hoping it wouldn't make me feel sad for Joss. After all, Buffy (in movie-form that preceded the series) was such a disappointment. But Serenity turned out to be more than I expected. Throughout the movie I laughed, I cried, and a few times I nearly jumped out of my seat with surprise. Joss and the cast went well beyond my expectations. The storyline was fresh while also tying up story lines from the series, the characters were further developed so we felt even more understanding of their actions, and the effects and scenery were beautifully original beyond the comparable sci-fi films of outer space.

942,kristij44,Solid Sci Fi Entertainment,9,4 October 2005,"I caught a couple episodes of Firefly when it originally aired and did enjoy the show, but not a die-hard fan. I found the film very entertaining - with a fast paced story, fight scenes the right length, humor and interesting characters and scenarios. I enjoyed entering into a world of the future - taking me to another time and place. The setting (some ultra modern, some third world oblivion) provides texture for a variety of interesting characters - some likable, some not - but all I found interesting to examine their perspectives and their interactions. I also enjoy action movies with no happy ending and no black/white winners/losers. Really this movie just seemed like one ""battle"" in a hard fought and never-ending (or at least no time in the near future) war. I would recommend this film and hope there are others in this series.",Serenity

If you were worried that you needed to see the TV series before watching Serenity, worry no more. Go see the movie, and prove to Hollywood that quality can come at a bargain pricetag. If you like the movie and haven't seen the series yet, watch it.The story was not what I was expecting. The little tidbits I saw in trailers that I was unable to avoid were NOT placed in a manner that I'd expect.The movie has surprises, and revelations, and action, and drama, and comedy, and yes, it has special effects.Unlike Orson Scott Card, I won't say it is the best Science Fiction movie ever, but I WILL say it is good, regardless of genre.",Serenity

Everything was so cliché... the rebellious captain who goes against common sense and the crew, the cold hearted imperial secret agent man, the mysterious girl with special powers and the blood, guts and glorified weapons specialist. Whoever put the script together should give up trying to make sparks fly between anyone because no romance was necessary and trying to force feed it down our throats was just annoying. The movie works if you're about 13 years old. Being 22, I was very bored and annoyed with this movie's feeble attempts to be funny and original.

Truly great actors. They make you believe the unbelievable and feel all their emotions while they're doing it. It's also one of the funniest movies I've ever been too.

However, this film changed my perspective of the whole genre.It is an amazing action-packed film that works just as well as a stand-alone film, and I should know as I had never watched a single episode of firefly before this. In fact, I was completely opposed to it in principle because it was the reason one of my favourite TV shows (Dark Angel) was cancelled.However, a mistake on my friend's part mixing up the times at the cinema meant that this was the only film on, so we decided to watch it, and I actually didn't know it was based on Firefly. Well all I can say is that from start to finish, I was astounded. I was taken in by the well-formed characters, the world, the backgrounds, the sets etc. and I went on to see it another two times, and am now waiting with avid anticipation for the DVD release.However, this film wasn't only good for the film, it was good because it introduced me to Firefly, which I am now just a little bit obsessed with.If you do anything this year, I advise you to rent this DVD out, in the hopes that a sequel will be made because it would be a travesty if this is where Firefly/Serenity ends 10 stars for sure.",Serenity

It seems many people can't handle that combination in a movie - they find mindless tripe to be more their speed.Serenity was based off of a failed TV show from 2002 called Firefly. FOX TV aired the show out of order, and shuffled the times, then canceled the show before airing all filmed episodes.But the fans wouldn't let go. Serenity is the child of the fan's love, and the cast and writer's love for the fans.The level of sassy, blunt, crass dialog was just fantastic. The plot was strong, and the execution was done well. Joss Whedon's directorial path was masterful, and the actors brought their roles to life. You do not have to have seen Firefly to like the movie - at the showing last night, a half-dozen of my fellow moviegoers who had never seen it swore that they loved the movie and wanted to borrow my DVD's of the show! This movie has intelligent dialog and a presence to it that makes you feel like you are present, and not just along for the ride.

951,spiritwnd,Why I Loved Serenity (Spoilers),10,3 October 2005,"While there are many points that I disagree with the Joss about, this is his story not mine.I didn't like losing Bok or Wash.I however did like the fact that Wash's death was quick and they didn't drag it out. I loved the attention to detail... I loved that even though at the end of the series one member of the family left, she came back. I loved the fact the Kaylie got her wish... I loved that River is no longer a complete nut job and is breaking free of her shell (while she is still rather unstable). I loved the fact that I was made to laugh, to cry, to sit on the edge of my seat and shake my head in disappointment of Mal not admitting his love for Inara. I loved the fact that I didn't want to leave and want to see how Zoe deals with her loss, how Simon and Kaylie handle their new love, if River is the new pilot and how she re-discovers herself, I love that Inara is back and Mal was put on the spot by Kaylie about not letting anything stop him from getting the one he loves...will he?Yes...people can complain about losing 2 main characters (and they are). It to me strengthens the bond that is between them. Even in the recent light of the loss of loved ones and family members of the crew, the bonds between them tightened.Just remember one little parable is life: A friend loveth for all seasons, but a brother is born for adversity.",Serenity
952,kimball-kinnison-1,Just another average move The 8.5 rating is not valid!!!!!,1,22 October 2005,"It's a bad day for the IMDb when a film like this gets such a large rating. Bladerunner has 8.2 and it is a classic, this just ain't. A 15-18 year old or a fan of the ""western in space"" genre might get off on it. Certainly fans of Firefly would enjoy it. BUT that leaves the rest of us looking for some depth, some original characterisation, a credible story for gods sake. Maybe I'm being unfair giving a 1 rating but this is just standard fare with a large cliché rating in the plot lines. It is not a great movie by any means. It is not a really bad movie but if it was on a TV channel it would be early evening viewing and pass without comment. Do not go to see this film because of references to the original Star Wars films or other movies. Go, if you want some escapist, light entertainment with an average movie, average script, small cast, the usual quirky stereotypical characters. Me, I was just glad when it was all over",Serenity
953,gandalf-15799,It's really a good end for the TV show Firefly!,9,17 July 2016,"Though i'm not a fun of River at all, it seems the whole story would be much more suitble if it is mainly concerned about the past of River and the hunting of the alliance. It did not satisfy me very much that the origin of the reaver, I wish there is more story about it. I think reavers could be something like zombies or vampires or highly intelligent combined creature of both, and it would be very interesting if the crew of serenity have some kind story with them.I really like Firely and this movie, and hope someday Firefly will restart!",Serenity
954,ghot1,We need more sci fi like this.,10,2 October 2005,"Every so often, a film emerges with a view of an entirely new universe, with enough detail to make it seem real, populated by a cast of characters we like and can relate to, and with a message that we remember long after we've left the theatre.Serenity is one of these films.From a production standpoint ... the score is excellent -- perfectly in keeping with the mood of the film. The characters are well developed, as one would expect given that the actors had time to develop them in the Firefly television series. The special effects were magnificent -- just what one would expect in a modern sci fi movie.This DEFINITELY needs a sequel or five.Or perhaps a TV series. {hint, hint}",Serenity

Acidently booked to see Serenity, you know when you get to the pictures and you just buy a ticket not really knowing much about the films that are on?Well I was amazed to find out that Serenity actually was the movie following the Firefly series!With the film you do not need to see the series to be up to date with the storyline, as the plot is nicely given to you.Again, just like Farscape you actually do care about the characters in this movie and they all are top notch in there roles.Add some great action scenes, some wit, fantastic kick ass fighting, and excellent special effects and you have a new franchise movies fanatics will love.I personally am tiresome of the Star Wars movies, this Serenity film does more for me with a considerable lower budget than the new films ever had.Do yourself a favour,even if you don't like sci fi films - Go and see it, you will not be disappointed!!4.5 out of 5 Stars!",Serenity

I thought I was missing a lot well now that I've seen this, I say I'd have been better off not watching this. Bad movies! Imagine how much of your time...precious time...they take from you...YOu pay the rental, you spend time going to the shop and then you spend time returning it when you ought to just throw away such time wasters in the biggest bin that you area has just spend more money on the gas on your way to the video shop.After I've seen this I ask myself why I went out and rented this crap. Have you seen Space Odessy 2001? No! Have you seen Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy? No...then why did i go out and rented it and not the masterpieces that are just lying on videoshop shelves? ANd all this because I saw the rave reviews and hyper comments terming this movie ""perfect""!The moment I saw the engine room trouble scene I thought I was re-visiting my favourite series of all time Star Trek. But this is no where near the great Trek. And whats with these crappy pistols...I mean they're even worse than our present day Brettas!The budget may be big but why is this film looks so cheap...from the sets to the effects to the wardrobe! Poor Acting. Crappy effects And did I say ridiculous wardrobes? There was this tough guy wearing this yellow T-shirt! I mean. Where's the future of clothing?Take my word, don't bother to even rent this. If you want to watch a space flick, watch The Hitchhiker's Guide to Galaxy instead. At least it offers something!",Serenity

Never saw the series, and probably not interested in seeing it. However, this film stands very nicely by itself. River was excellent, and the Capt Mal, a bit weaker than I would imagine this type of Captain to be, but believable. Some of the side characters left a bit to be desired, but the Assassin was well portrayed. Some of the sexual overtones were pointed out, and that was good. Definitely a film worth seeing several times to catch all the quips! The CGI were overall excellent. Planetary displays were good. Lot's of Chinese or Japanese characters present on all decks. International audience or targetted?",Serenity
958,healeynator,"Quality filming, excellent story",10,27 November 2006,"I discovered the Firefly 'verse with this movie, and not the series as most fans did. I saw the previews originally, and figured it was another action-filled semi-brainless space opera. After consulting with some of my friends, I was told to just see it and decide for myself. And now I can say with conviction that I am so glad I listened.The movie blew me away: It was smart, brilliantly filmed, perfectly scripted, and contained amazing acting and deep, layered characters that left me begging for more.Shortly after seeing the movie, I bought the DVD series, and after a week of watching, I can now say definitively that Serenity and Firefly is the most imaginative, original and well composed science fiction (hell, any genre) series I have seen thus far.10/10",Serenity
959,chappens,One of the best movies of the year,10,1 October 2005,"I saw this movie opening day, at the very first showing, and I have to say, that this one is in a very close race to be my favorite movie of the year, although Batman is going to fight that tooth and nail.From beginning to end of this superb movie, I couldn't help but watch as Mal and the crew did what they do best, namely get in trouble. The acting was consistent with what I had come to expect from Joss Whedon. Making sure there are just enough laughs to satisfy the comedian in everyone, and just the right blend of seriousness.I would recommend, that anyone who goes out to see this move first see the series. Otherwise, many of the characters you just won't care about. Clearly this movie was made by Joss, for the fans of the series, because it doesn't really get into the histories of the characters, into their varying relationships. In the end, it is a continuation of an excellent series, and is one of the few movies that has ever left me hungering for a sequel.I give this movie 10 stars, only because the option does not exist to give it 11 stars.Watch this movie!",Serenity
960,daleh425,Fantastic!,10,14 April 2006,"It's a shame that when truly good sci-fi comes along, it gets canceled. For me, the Firefly series was the best since the orig Star Trek (hey didn't that get canceled pretty early too). I didn't even know about this until just recently (I guess that's part of the problem). Watching the series episodes on DVD in order, and following that with the movie, was a wonderful experience. Hey there may be some holes here and there, but it's always about the characters - and of course the story. And with this bunch, the characters (and acting) are great, and the storyline a lot of fun (especially that of River). I gave it a 10 out of 10. Well done! If it came back, I'd be a regular.",Serenity

Bad acting, horrible storyline, cheesy not so special effects. Save your money and buy cheeze wiz and crackers because this was one major stinker. Don't let all the Weldon ""Browncoats"" trick you with their repeated positive reviews. This movie tanked hugely at the box office which should be the first clue. Do you think it arrived on DVD so quickly because it was a big success? Even Wal-Mart knows a stinker as they're selling Serenity with The Hulk in a double DVD set. Buy 2 bad movies for the price of one, what a deal. Save your money, save our time, you'll thank me later.",Serenity

After a marathon of watching the dvds before opening night and sharing the love with as many people as possible it was heaven to be immersed in the 'verse once again, even better, writ large on the big screen. I have been a movie goer all my life (when I die I want my ashes spread at the entrance to the first cinema I can remember going to, I was four)and this was by far and away the most shared experience I have had. Recruiting Browncoats, sharing the brilliance of Joss Whedon, even joining a fan club, I ask again, how much fun can you have and still cry at the end. See, enjoy and share!",Serenity

Lots of people had told me that the film was fantastic but there was a hardcore of people that had seen it that didn't think so.I think it's safe to say that I have no idea what they were on about. Well I think I know what their problem is - but this is a Joss Whedon film, what were they expecting...The film surpassed my (very high) expectations.Would recommend it to anyone who likes any of the following: Sci-Fi, Action, Comedy, Horror.The film effortlessly blends these (and a few more) genres and works really well too.Ed",Serenity
964,funk007,Quite simply...,10,11 October 2005,"...a fantastic film in my opinion. It's the Sci-Fi you've been waiting for. Whether you've seen Firefly or not it's hard not to enjoy Serenity. Equal parts funny, deep and emotional. Equal amounts of action and good dialogue. Great casting of Chiwetel Ejiofor for 'The Operative', he's going places. He has all the charisma Laurence Fishburn has and then some. I really liked the fact The movie stepped away slightly from Firefly in that it had a more adult theme and didn't pull any punches. All the performances were spot on, but if I could have one criticism it would be that I wanted more character development for the n00bs. I took my girlfriend who had never seen Firefly before and she loved Serenity as much as I did. I really want her to see Firefly now, mainly because I want to watch it all again. Lol.I say this film deserves a trilogy, hell, how about a TV spin off! :)",Serenity

Yes, I am a fan of the TV series on which the movie is based, but I don't think that matters. Serenity is dark, laugh-out-loud funny, and edge-of-your-seat intense. Sci-fi at it's best. I haven't been as moved by a movie... probably ever.Parts of it were a bit rushed, it's true, and some of the characters aren't developed quite as well as they could be, but for all that, it's still amazing. The dialogue and the acting are just brilliant, and it tells a story that will stay with you for a long while after you leave the theatre. Definitely a film to see on the big screen.",Serenity

This film will take you to the high's and lows of being on serenity just like in the TV series. The film fill's in all the gaps i had bugging me yet leaves a nice wide door open for a sequel... Just like Star Wars did! Fingers crossed a sequel or a new season of Firefly comes out of this.

I went into the theater thinking this was going to be another Hollywood muck-up (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy comes to mind readily), but I came out beaming. The characters I have come to love from the series are all there as I remember them. Shiny.I don't think I have ever held my breath during a movie, but found myself short of air repeatedly while watching this one. The movie is so incredibly intense that I now find myself without fingernails... I don't normally bite my fingernails. When the movie was over, the audience stayed, wiped the tears from their eyes and clapped. !!Not one of them moved!! A packed house and not a single person moved until the credits were over.I'm not one to use the word ""genius"" often... especially when referring to movies... but here it is: The writer is a genius, the director is a genius and the actors are nothing short of genius.If you love the series, your heart will do crazy things when you watch this movie.

968,Tyveil,Whedons masterpiece exceeds expectations.,10,3 October 2005,"Not since Lord of the Rings have I seen a movie with such dramatic storytelling, a varied and interesting cast of characters for which to fall in love with, and such stunning, edge-of-your-seat thrilling moments. Joss takes the characters many ""Firefly"" fans have known and loved, and he throws them through the meat grinder. The action is intense and the danger to the characters feels very real throughout the flick. There were times I believed that the entire cast of main characters were going to be slaughtered and the story would end with them having failed their mission. There are very few other movies I can think of where the danger felt that ""real"".Obviously, a fan of the television series will feel a stronger attachment to the characters, but this doesn't mean those who haven't ever seen the television show will not enjoy the movie. The movie stands on its own very well. There are some new, very interesting characters introduced throughout the story... and the existing Firefly crew character development is not lacking in this story. Their trademark characteristics show throughout Serenity, without ever once slowing down the story.The visual and sound effects in Serenity are nothing short of stunning. There are plenty of scenes the likes of Star Wars and Matrix that will leave you breathless and wiping your brow, just before Joss throws another curveball at the crew thats sure to bring a groan of sympathy for their misfortune.Last but not least I have to mention the humor throughout the movie. The dialogue is spectacular and very many times extremely funny. I can think of few comedies that made me laugh as often as Serenity did. I believe even a non-sci-fi fan will appreciate the humor in this flick.Comedy, drama, edge-of-your-seat thriller, sci-fi, western, call it what you will, ""Serenity"" is a top-notch movie and a masterpiece achievement for Whedon and crew.",Serenity
969,guiltykilty,"great, FUN film",9,1 October 2005,"I must say I saw Firefly the movies base, the series was a hard sell, but I became attached to the characters and it was cool to see them again. The film does a good job introducing them to new views considering it did not have 14 hours to do so as the ""series"" did. Is it worth going to see again, well YES. My wife wants to go again and she has NEVER seen a movie twice in a theater. Sorry for the misspelling of the word theater but well IMDb does not recognize Canadian spelling. The effects were great, the dialog was smart and witty. Some changes from the series but all things cant be perfect, thats pretty much sums up the movie.",Serenity
970,spykez,Wow,10,1 October 2005,All I can say is wow. The director/producer deserves all the credit in the world. I saw all the episodes in one night from the storyline being so great and to come and see this movie made my day. The suspense never fails and is always keeping you on the edge of your seat or rolling off of it from laughing so hard. It's said that if this movie doesn't make more than 80 Million dollars Hollywood won't make another one. Let all us FireFly fans pray they do.Basically what this movie is about is a future western style Sci-Fi where 2 brown coats from a war stick together and form a group of thiefs so to speak. They take on jobs underground such as stealing money or equipment from the police type known as the alliance. Also they try to avoid a cannibal army known as Reavers who...well...you'll just have to watch the movie to see what kinda people these are.,Serenity
971,w_r_perry,They aim to misbehave,10,21 January 2006,"Serenity is my top movie for 2005, and I'll tell you why: the characters. It is based on, and in conclusion to, the prematurely cancelled (thank you Fox) TV show Firefly. If you have seen the show before, you probably already love the characters, if not, you will.Instead of being inexorably drawn by the tides of the universe, even though the main character at one point states that he simply follows the wind, this movie is drawn forward and driven by the characters. Their choices, their emotions, and their relationships are what guide this. Not technology, deus ex machinas, or even their desperate situation (which becomes increasingly so, as in any great sci fi flick).Yes, the action is great, though not on par with the Matrix as some commercials state for some reason. Yes, the special effects are spectacular, although obviously not created by ILM. And yes, the story and the big twist revelation at the end keep you guessing. But what makes this movie is the characters. Believable, fresh and compelling.",Serenity

It was so good to see the entire cast there filling the roles of some of the better characters in Sci-Fi! Since, I have watched all the episodes again and am eagerly awaiting any news for a second movie and/or revival of the TV series. Tell all your friends, family, and the rest of the 'Verse to go see it, because we need to support films that aren't forcing the same formats and actors in our faces. All the actors are top notch and were wonderful. They may not be blockbusters ,yet, but hopefully we can change that in the near future! Stay Shiny!",Serenity
973,kelandis,Excellence,10,3 October 2005,"This was, hands down, the best movie I've seen in many, many years. The action is seamless...after the first few scenes. You're in the movie the whole time...it's impossible not to be. The characters are just as great as they were in the series, and the action is even better. You learn some interesting (to say the least) tidbits, and some events you may have been hoping for occur. Of course, there are other things that you may not want to see...but all in all, a great movie that makes you take it seriously. You never know where it's going. It's not another ""oh, I know what's going to happen in the end...so the entire movie til then is just filler"" movie. If you loved the series, you'll love the movie...if you don't love the series, what's wrong with you??",Serenity

Oh, and did I mention the humor? My husband and I are still cracking each other up with dozens of lines that are not only funny in and of themselves, but bring back the adventure. It's hard NOT to fall in love with it all and immediately start hoping for a sequel so we can enjoy it again. In the meantime, I think I'll go Fandango some tickets for NEXT weekend.",Serenity
975,AmyCat,Still flying!,10,3 October 2005,"Joss Whedon does an amazing job here: he's created a film that won't disappoint the Browncoats who've seen every episode of ""Firefly"" so often they're wearing out their DVDs... and one which will thrill people who've never even heard of the original TV series.Aside from the fates of certain characters (if you've seen the movie, you know which ones!), my only complaint was that he didn't include the original TV series theme song except as a bitty instrumental during the end credits. I was really hoping to get the whole thing, lyrics and all, on the ""Serenity"" soundtrack CD...It's been suggested that Whedon should have used ""big name"" film actors rather than the original TV cast... Nonsense! The cast is perfect, and they do a better job than any number of over-paid ""name"" actors in certain recent ""blockbuster"" sci-fi films with much higher budgets! I'll see ""Serenity"" in theaters more times than the last ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" films put together!",Serenity

Definitely a disappointment.",Serenity
977,wnielsenbb,Least boring movie ever.,10,3 October 2005,"I have to admit I am a Firefly fan. I have seen the entire series 8 times, the pilot 16 times, and a few other episodes 13 times or so. The movie is a little different, but it is fantastic. I have seen it three times and it still is very exciting. I brought my family last night. My 17 year old daughter was literally on the edge of her seat. My 7 year old son was shaking from excitement. OK, it was a little TOO exciting for him. I had to take him out of the theater for a bit. There is almost no place in this move where you are tempted to hit the restroom. Go before you enter. Star Wars is a likely comparison. The Serenity is much what you could imagine a show about Han Solo would be like. The movie has action equal to the best action of Star Wars, but none of the boring parts. The dialog is where Serenity really shines. There is simply no comparison. Very witty.",Serenity
978,chase-54,A real look at Serenity,4,6 October 2005,"I'll say that it was not quite the blight on our culture that I expected -- it didn't have that much significance. However, that said, it is by no means among the ""best films ever made"". Those are the ravings of zealots who upon being scorned when Fox pulled the show, kept a torch burning in their heart for the series all this time.When I first heard about Serenity, it was from a young snot whose tastes in culture I find akin to a McNugget enthusiast's. Thus, I was immediately dismissive, and moreover I became angry that he would honestly call this one of the best films ever made. My first thought: Please. I'm sure it's not going to be sharing the AFI listing with the Godfather, Casablanca or Citizen Kane anytime soon...However, my best friend - an avid sci-fi fan - wanted to see it, and I went along with my expectations sufficiently low. Perhaps too low. I was expecting something on the order of Blade or Supernova. It wasn't that awful. But, this is not great film. It's merely okay.In reality, this reminded me nothing so much as a strange amalgamation of Cowboy Bebop and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It's zombie space-cowboy theatre peppered with painfully hip one-liners so often, you start to expect to hear a rimshot. Then you realize it's just gunfire. The gub'mint assassin was interesting up until the end when he flattened back out into a cardboard cutout version of a spaghetti western bad guy.As much as it tempts me to really tear it apart, this wouldn't be fair. I've seen plenty of mediocre movies and merely shrugged them away. What prompts me to want to pay special attention to eviscerating Serenity is really part of a larger issue I have with my generation's idea of what constitutes greatness.For a film chocked with scathing clever dialogue, look to the banter between Cary Grant and Rosalind Russel in His Girl Friday. Yojimbo was a great film outlining the ronin morals, and went on to influence some great westerns like One Upon A Time in The West and The Good, The Bad & The Ugly. Orson Welles was great when he delivered his morally corrupt monologue in The Third Man. When Star Wars first came out, it defined an entire genre of epic science fiction where previously it had only been fit for the B-screen.There are so many actually great films that anyone with a reasonable budget, a computer with Internet access and a mailbox can see nowadays with services like Netflix. There's no reason for so many young people to not know great cinema. There are films like The Passion of Joan of Arc that are so powerful and visceral that it won't surprise you when you learn that the actress playing Joan went a bit mad afterward, and never worked again. But, so many people who really ought to see it, won't even hear of it.It would take me days to recognize the many truly wonderful films there are in the repository of our culture, and never would I come close to including something like Serenity. It simply is not up to that kind of par, and I find it hugely disturbing that such a large number of people could honestly consider what I saw today to be an equal among so many of its betters.It's really symptomatic of a much larger issue that troubles me. It seems that people no longer recognize or expect true greatness. Somehow that's been lost in the shuffle of advertising. Certainly, for every one great achievement throughout history, there have always been a million items of vapid fluff, but when did we lose the ability as a culture to tell the difference? It makes me sad, and for that, I'm probably being harder on Serenity than it deserves, but it's going to have to be considered a casualty in my war against embraced mediocrity.",Serenity
979,B-E-P,serenity review,9,6 October 2005,"Serenity is made by the American director Joss Whedon having an extraordinary mind for fondness to the characters he makes throughout his series 'Buffy the vampire slayer, Angel and the series of this movie (firefly) set before the movie. Though the movie continues the series it explains to non fans the grasp of the story and works quite well. The story of the film makes it extraordinary as it is unique for a space western to be controlled by an alliance and have been wrecked havok with the reavers. They must dodge the alliance and the reavers through a constant struggle to galaxy freedom. The movie does a good job taking the characters from the series to a big screen and the effects are extraordinary as they should be. Though however some characters are not seen often through out the film as in the series. A lot of shock's and amazing choreography with rivers fighting. This has got to be the best sci-fi films in a very long time on the big screen. The film makes you feeling like a whole film instead of a sequel having to be put in place and deserves a good recognition from all audiences as it has somethings for all ages.",Serenity
980,zenmonki,A terrific film that focuses on interesting roguish characters that combine southern charm with hilarity and high adventure.,10,8 October 2005,"In case you don't already know, Serenity the first movie of a TV series called Firefly which was brought back from the dead by popular demand of a devoted fan base.The TV series airs on the Sci-Fi channel now, but originally aired on WB or UPN, I think. I've only noticed this show recently and have never actually watched an episode yet. However, after watching this film, I believe I'm gonna be a big fan.The premise of the show follows a group of space-faring southern-talking rogues as they roam the galaxy robbing the rich and / or powerful and giving to themselves. Imagine a crew of sexy space pirates with good hearts with an ex-civil-war-era colonel / country-boy as their ship's captain.I think this film's story was unique in that it blended a sci-fi future with rustic elements of the south and a Robin-Hood-esquire crew in a great way. There were some awesome special effects, but you didn't notice them as much as the interaction between the characters. In my book that was a hell of a testament to the skill and talent of writer / director Joss Whedon. The comedic banter and one-liners were terrific. Some favorite examples:Washburn: This is gonna get pretty interesting. Reynolds: Define ""interesting"". Washburn: Oh, God, oh, God, we're all gonna die. Reynolds (over intercom): This is the captain. We're about to experience some turbulence followed by an explosion.Zoë: Do you really think any of us are getting out of here alive? Jayne: Well, I might. My wife pointed out that one nice part of this movie (the ""best movie I've ever seen in this genre"" according to her) was that it didn't use a whole lot of weird names or places and an overly complicated plot that you had to whisper back and forth about (""who are they talking about?"" ""What does that mean?""). The story was simple but fulfilling without an unnecessary tangle of twisting sub-plots.The villains of the film were great. You had a horde of space-faring cannibal madmen (and madwomen) called Reavers roaming around that could descend at any moment and were horribly wicked. Then you had this icy-calm, gentlemanly, bad-assed, samurai-futuroso chasing after the escaped psychic-super-warrior-woman who was now part of the Serenity crew.I heard the director/writer interviewed a week or so ago and he said something like ""It's got gunfights, sword-fights, fistfights, explosions, and cannibals. It's got everything you could want in a movie!"" I never realized that I wanted cannibals in my movies, but by gosh if they didn't make it better!http://outpost1.blogspot.com (Do yourself a favor.

981,madgy85,Excellent Film even better TV series,10,9 October 2005,"I was surprised to have witnessed the cancellation of FireFly. I hope they revive the show because the movie itself is probably the fire needed to start the flame of FireFly. The movie as with the television show is revetting, hilarious, action packed, and just simply an awesome fantasy/western film. There is this excellent sense of diversity and character harmony within the crew of Serenity. Honestly, in my opinion the film has a wonderful blend of comedy and action that reaches a vast majority of people in the young adult to adult mass audience. I have to also mention that I never in my 20 years of existence would witnessed the blend of Chinese language in the western/scifi/fantasy film. Now that is very unique!",Serenity
982,fintalones,"Amazing for fans, great sci-fi for newcomers",10,10 October 2005,"I am Firefly otaku. I admit it. If you are a fan of the show, you've already seen this movie, so these comments are not for you. If you haven't seen the show or the movie, yet are somehow reading this, stop now. Go to Amazon, order the Firefly boxed set, and watch it. I promise - by the time you get to ""Out of Gas"", you'll be hooked.As for Serenity, it is a wonderful movie. Great action, great comedy, great dialog. The FX are occasionally cheesy (specificly the hovercraft scene near the beginning), but for a $40 million dollar movie, they are incredible. (To put that figure in perspective, Peter Jackson's King Kong remake reportedly cost $170 million.) See the show, see the movie. You won't be sorry.",Serenity
983,fresne,Science Fiction with a brain,10,12 October 2005,"In a short story every word counts and has a purpose. Serenity is like that. Every moment you're learning something new. Every minute you're riding the roller coaster to the next valley and peak in the plot. The story takes you from laughter one moment to gasp and clutch your partner the next. There's something for everyone from characters who don't take themselves seriously to excellent CGI to whirling dervish-foo. Plus, Serenity does what the best science fiction does, it makes you think in an interesting and well realized world. The gritty lived in feel of this future makes me think of a cross between Star Wars and the Unforgiven. Well worth seeing in the movie theater.",Serenity
984,SEAL847,engaging,10,12 October 2005,"I love the scifi genre and I loved this movie. Not because it was the best I had ever seen, although it makes it high on the list, but because this world is not the clean and sanitized one so often seen in many,if not most scifi films. The Star Wars saga was our first introduction into the potential reality of life in space amongst numerous planetary cultures that didn't resemble the squeaky clean ""Buck Rogers""look. Well, Serenity takes it one step further and not only makes the experience realistic looking, but at times places the characters in an unfavorable light and awkward situations. I was taken in by a world that both fascinates and terrifies all at the same time. Difficult decisions and questionable motives added to this element of reality and to the depth of the characters. If any film merits a sequel (or two), this is the one.",Serenity
985,i_kant_spel,Serenity is amazing but not serene,10,13 October 2005,"You must see this movie. Joss Whedon transforms sci fi once again. His characters are people you can grow to love and his stories will leave you breathless. Weather you love sci fi or just appreciate a good story this movie is for you. It is a comedy, a mystery, an action film, a romance, a drama, and a thriller all in one. I know it sounds weird - a space and cowboy adventure mixed together. I know you're thinking ""what""? But I promise you it works. Joss Whedon is one of the greatest artists of our time. He was messed over by TV networks and movie companies and now even his fans are screwing him over by not seeing his movie. He will be appreciated in the years to come as the genus he is so why not be ahead of the time and appreciate him now.",Serenity
986,alaceky,A Muddled Mess,3,3 January 2006,"I'm sorry, but I just didn't ""get"" this. Yes, I followed the main plot, but between the opening and closing credits I kept going ""Whaaaaa?"" I'm a seasoned science-fiction fan, and this movie just made me angry. The director apparently didn't care if anyone understood what was going on.It's like watching the 45th episode of a TV series you've never seen. It jumps from scene to scene with no explanation, the dialog is almost deliberately obscure, and even the characters' names are hard to make out. I had to look up this movie on IMDb in order to learn the girl's name (River Tam). I couldn't tell if it was River Town, River Dam, or what.An absolute piece of crap. Good visuals, but very, very bad story-telling.I suppose if you've read the novels or pulp-magazine installments this is apparently based on, you might enjoy it. The rest of us will be left shaking our heads.Don't waste your time. And if you liked it, get a life. There's a whole, real, world out there. And it makes sense.",Serenity
987,velogirl08,"Don't be frightened off by the hype. A good story awaits in ""Serenity"".",8,17 October 2005,"I went through my ""Buffy"" phase, flirted ever so briefly with ""Angel"" and then sold my BtFS DVDs and bought into ""Sex and the City"". Simply put, ""Buffy"" no longer applied to my life as a late 20-something and ""Angel"" was just too out there. I stopped watching so much TV and started dabbling in sports, fresh air, and other enemies of the true pasty geek (sorry, had to go there). So when I heard Joss Whedon had a new series out my verbatim response was ""Meh"". Not interested. Too much geek there. I missed it completely.A few months ago, I noticed a magazine tearsheet over a co-worker's desk for ""Serenity"". It looked intriguing, and so did the trailers. Whedon's more adult humor and characters appealed- Nathan Fillion and Alan Tudyk are my age in real life and more ""relatable"" than the BtFS group. I borrowed the ""Firefly"" DVDs and I was amazed and enthralled. The story was intense and involving without straining credulity too much and without relying too heavily on ""deus ex machina"" (which can get annoying). The setting was unique, a space opera set in the Wild West, sprinkled with Asian culture, the premise believable, and unlike ""Dune"" you didn't have to ""get it"" to ""get it"". For example, I don't understand a word of Chinese, but I don't need to to understand the basic gist of what's being said. One of my favorite episodes involves Adam Baldwin's mercenary Jayne Cobb being a cult hero to a downtrodden planet.Whedon drew his characters well and gave them distinct voices, something he is particularly skilled at. None of the actors are big stars- although Tudyk, Fillion, and Gina Torres have been in other big projects and Baldwin is, well, a Baldwin- so the movie can't coast on a big name. Whedon's strong writing is the real star and the movie is a great stand-alone.That said, you will *definitely* enjoy the movie more if you see the show. You will understand why Kaylee and Simon look at each other longingly and why Simon refers to regretting spending all that time on Serenity and not bedding the mechanic (the backstory on how she came to Serenity is hysterical, by the way), and why Mal knows Inara's home is a trap because their wave is amicable. You will see more of what makes Jayne so bullheaded and preposterous. You will understand why Wash's sudden death is so shocking and what Zoe is really talking about when she tells Mal that the ship is pretty ripped up but will run fine. And can I tell you how much of a crush I developed on Sean Maher (Dr. Simon Tam)? Gotta love those Irish boys- after all, my grandmother had impeccable taste and she married one!) I saw the movie last Friday (10/4)and will probably see it again- this is saying a lot as it's rare to find a movie that's good and bears repeated watching. Many good movies are great once, but ""Serenity"" is good enough that you don't have to feel guilty about enjoying it... or looking forward to a sequel. This show was saved by the fans, and despite initial resistance I became one. Mr. Whedon, I'll be waiting for the next installment.",Serenity
988,gweeb000,"Come for the special FX, stay for the characters.",10,27 October 2005,"That's how it was for me and Star Wars, when the original trilogy hit theaters. Those movies inspired many of us to make stories of our own. I'm happy to say that the adventure and humanity of those stories are alive and well in ""Serenity."" Only now the characters are fully-realized, fleshed-out, three-dimensional people. You can genuinely love and hate these guys as if they were your own friends, family, coworkers.The effects truly serve the story. The spaceship battle towards the end looked great, and, as a bonus, had a point. It had drama. You care about what happens.Never seen Firefly? You can't turn off your brain for this one. However, viewers who are new to the story won't be left in the dust. Everything's there for you to jump into the rich back-story from the television series.I haven't experienced a movie like this in a long time. There were scenes that inspired in me genuine fear, relief, sadness, excitement. I feel like a kid again. The old stories are back.",Serenity
989,chief6988,"Serenity, one of the best movies I have seen.. period!",10,20 October 2005,"Serenity is one of the best movies I've seen in a long while. The advertisements don't do it justice. I think it's better than Star Wars, the original, it blows all the others away! People see it and think Sci Fi, well if you like Sci Fi you should like it, but it is really more action adventure, with a lot of humor that happens to be in a Sci Fi setting. Very character driven, sucks you into the movie and you find yourself along for the ride, and caring about the characters.After seeing this movie, it makes me thing Fox must have really botched the publicity for the series when they tried it out. It only lasted a year, but wow, what a fun show! the characters just click, the writing is good and witty, and it's for the most part pretty fast paced.",Serenity
990,mickelsenej1,Not a great film,3,26 October 2005,"A cluttered, far-fetched and contrived plot, dimensionless characters and lack of story motive make this a mediocre film at best. I must admit, I know nothing about Firefly, nor anything coming from Whedon. Regardless, this is just not a well-told story.The protagonists have no reason to do anything they do except perhaps the rescue in the very beginning of the film. There is no moral, no cohesive philosophy, and puzzlingly vague and meaningless references to theology. No one is particularly likable or purposeful. The ultimate heroic mission seems to be more about ""the peoples' right to know"" than anything, a motive chosen seemingly arbitrarily. There are some characters in the film from whom you would think that some wisdom and purpose could be derived - they are left undeveloped as all concerned go through a harrowing series of events on the prompting of their own blind, illogical impulses. Moreover, the whole thing just feels thrown together. Mark my words, this film's popularity is not because of its own merit nor will it last. Perhaps it is a cult favorite, but it is not a great film.",Serenity
991,DavevanderKroon,Didn't like this one * possible spoilers*,3,14 November 2005,"To start before I give my opinion: This is what I think about the movie, not about you. I've seen MANY good/bad movies... This one has very bad actors in it.. the (amateuristic) expressions on their faces, the way they speak their lines... just don't cut it for me. The dialogs are so bad and cliché too. Just watch the part where River was saved.. and the part after it where the black guy kills everybody and says something to the doctor like: dude killing yourself with a sword is honorable etc.. Horrible dialogs and acting. I'm not gonna watch it again so I can copy some more examples to please the people who liked it and want to know what I base it on. I know that people who don't like it too know what I mean... and if YOU like it, well.. OK! The settings were awfully cheap too.. like it's borrowed from an old star trek movie. To be honest, it looked like cardboard. The story: well it's not really entertaining or much more stupid than bad boys 2 for example... the girl has some skills and government, savage creatures want to eat people etc.. blabla.... watch an average anime or some b-movies or maybe a better star trek/wars and you can see a similar story. So not really bad, but not surprisingly fresh too. Special effects.. like explosions etc.. well If you watch the A-team you'll see better explosions, the ones in the movie were almost like the explosions in the last season of airwolf. To be honest, I was thinking I was seeing a polished movie of that time, the time where star wars and battlestar galactica ruled the world. But worse.( I really love star wars! )This is more a movie to wait for on television, not for visiting a cinema. I really had high expectations of this movie because I visit this site and it was high rated, many people loved it etc. If other SF movies like star wars etc were Ocean's 11, this one is absolutely Ocean's 12I really don't get it why this movie is so high rated. There are so many better movies which are unrated which can take it's place, like Vanilla Sky for example.. which has a good story, good acting and decent actors in it. I know that is not the same genre, but the rating isn't about genre. THIS movie in the same list as Terminator 2, The godfather, Eternal sunshine Of the spotless mind and The green mile? Well that's it for now. If I don't have the same opinion like you, please be intelligent and don't flame me like a little 12 yr old nerdy kid. I won't react on it. I don't flame the people who like it too.",Serenity
992,donqasimo,TV sci-fi at it's worst!,1,10 November 2005,"Whilst watching this I couldn't help noticing the wooden acting from the protagonist. Aaaaawful! The story comes straight of the Minority Report pre-cognitives. From the outset the movie stunk of low quality TV, the b-level sci-fi series' that aspire to be like Star Trek. Not one to remember and definitely not one to buy! The dialogue is sticky, sfx and cinematography amateurish. This definitely has to go down as the most overrated movie ever. I'd give it minus 8.3 if I could although it would be great for the kids. Adults stay away if you've got any sense watching this could seriously harm your brainwaves. The protagonist makes an impassioned speech which barely raises an eyebrow let alone a heart. How this got to the theatres or even into production astounds.",Serenity

You won't want to miss a second of this one.There's plenty here for everybody: Good writing, humor, excellent acting, plot, action (that actually makes sense in terms of the plot), excellent cgi, eye candy. And it's a movie that needs the big screen for the full effect. Watch it in theater; don't just wait for the DVD.If you saw Star Wars (the original) in the theater way back when, then this movie will evoke a similar feeling of awe.

Not a lot of people have heard about Firefly here in Belgium and I hope this will change.I couldn't believe that Fox canceled Firefly just after 13 episodes, that must have been the dumbest move in history of television.And then i heard they were making a motion picture of Firefly, i was so glad....finally.Serenity is to my humble opinion one of the best science-fiction-adventure i have seen in years. It has it all : brilliant cast and characters, good story, mind-blowing special effects, good sense of humor,....It is so good, they should lock up George Lucas in a room with only a DVD-player, a TV-screen and a copy of Serenity and force him to watch it because this is what Star Wars episode 1,2 and 3 should have been.Congratulations to Joss Whedon !!!!",Serenity
996,nazard,pure cheese,1,16 January 2006,"Like I said, pure cheese. Half baked story, bad acting, and the monsters were people with zombie makeup. OK, they have some decent visual effects going sometimes, but so what, that should accentuate an already great movie, not be the foremost and sole good point of it. Actually, my opinion is incomplete as I walked out of this movie after the first 30-45 minutes because I was so insulted that I was charged full admission for it. The psionics stuff in it is just a rehash of other movies and fantasy concepts; I didn't particularly like what they did with it. That is to say I didn't find a trace of originality in this movie, just a bunch of the same stuff from other sources smeared together by some hack script writer looking to make a quick buck. The dialogue was contrived and transparently leading you into character development without actually deceiving you into thinking it was natural conversation. I gave this movie the lowest rating possible but I can see it's made the high end of the Top Adventure movies just as Lord of the Rings: Return of the King has made #1 on the Top Action movies, so I can see that people on this site really enjoy garbage as long as it has any slight appeal to them.",Serenity

From start to finish a fantastic, funny, action packed, emotional roller coaster of a ride that can be enjoyed by die hard Firefly fans (Or Browncoats as they prefer to be called) and newcomers to the firefly 'verse. The writing and directing are first rate as well as the acting. From start to finish it really is one hell of a film with no change of pace the whole way through. On top of all that the cgi work is second to none, I found myself white knuckled with teeth clenched during the ""Leaf on the wind"" scene and I know I wasn't the only one the whole cinema was packed with back seat pilots. I left the theatre drained (but in a good way). Lets just hope for a sequel",Serenity

Their lives of petty crime are interrupted by a psychic passenger who carries a dangerous secret.The Firefly universe implies a sci-fi universe of its own. It revolves around humans and different genetical developments and abominations, but introduces no alien mayhem. Because of this it is different from Star Wars, Star Trek and other popular sci-fi, but not less credible.The character development, storyline and dialogue are excellent. Only thing that bothers me was that the plot sort of rushes through. Things happen too fast, although everything is understandable. If you are looking for a spoiler plot lookup 'Serenity' on wikipedia.I strongly recommend you go watch this movie first though. If you don't you will have missed on a great chunk of the sci-fi world and an excellent movie overall, which cannot necessarily be said of other sci-fi titles.",Serenity
999,ronald-hogenboom,"Good, but not great for novices",8,8 December 2005,"The actual review I read here was the reason I wanted to see the movie. I never heard of the original TV-series (although I will definitively order the DVDs now) so the whole Serenity universe was new to me.So what did I think of it? Sadly I can't help being slightly disappointed, as was my best friend. Why? You see, we were indeed novices but also Joss Whedon fans, especially Buffy the vampire slayer (BTVS) fans. What makes Buffy so great is not the vampires and demons, the battle between good and evil, the fight scenes, not even the attractive yet vulnerable heroine. What makes Buffy stand out is the interaction between the characters, the brilliant witty dialogue and one-liners, the ever present innuendo. Maybe in the original Firefly TV-series the characters have come to the point where they really interact, but in a single movie it just didn't work. I have no doubt that people who like the series love to see all the characters reappear, but to us novices they don't really come alive. Such a pity.Furthermore, the hero of the story, Mal, doesn't cut it for me. I've read glowing praise for him but I can't agree. He is just too two-dimensional. I didn't feel I liked or disliked him, he was just there. Heroes you are supposed to like, to admire but he seemed so colorless. Shame. The River Tam character I liked a lot better but here I also though she should have gotten more room in the story. She just freaks and fights. The horror elements I didn't care for much either, a bit too shocking (as in the mental flashes River gets) and overall to gross.Still I would give this movie 8 out of ten, so that's pretty good.It is a solid and well made sci-fi movie with apparently a small budget but I agree that it doesn't show anywhere. The pace of the action is also OK. The rag-tag crew of the Serenity is actually still quite funny and there are some nice jokes (but please give us more!). The operative is a whole new kind of villain, composed, not your usual foaming at the mouth type, just someone who really believes in what he stands for, even it is obviously the wrong thing (otherwise, why would he be the villain?).In the end it is a movie that tries hard and succeeds admirably on a lot of counts, but sadly not on the main reason I wanted to see it: Joss Whedon style wit and character interaction. Would I buy the DVD though? Yes, immediately. Would I like to see a sequel? YES, but please make it that little bit better. So 8 of 10 for the promise, if not entirely the content.",Serenity
1000,darren-slade,good but not an 8.2 !,6,8 December 2005,"I was really looking forward to this film, given its high score and build up and that I am a massive fan of the sci-fi genre of films. Let me just say - its good, but not that good. Saying that, I have never seen Firefly, but given this film, I don't really want to. Its very predictable and cheesy, but the action is good and the special effects are pretty good in parts( Spoiler-apart from when the serenity crashes, that looks a bit like an effect from Red Dwarf ! ) The acting is average, no one does a brilliant job. Its funny in parts but nothing to make you laugh out loud, well, saying that, see if anyone else noticed the SPOILER below :When mal and the black dude are fighting near the end there is a scene that did make me howl, but I'm not sure it was meant to. the black dude goes for his sword and mel jabs him in the arm pit, the hard, very hard black dude lets out a ""ouch"" sound !! it reminded me and my flat mate of when neo was fighting morphius in the matrix - imagine the scene - Stop trying to hit me and .......ouch.

1001,yqhhqy,"Interesting characters, plot, and look - not just for Firefly fans",10,27 June 2006,"Serenity is a continuation of the show Firefly, which has a strong cult following. That being the case, an enthusiastic rating could be merely the result of fan approval, as opposed to a genuine reflection of the movie's merits.But as a person who has never seen Firefly, I can say that Serenity reaches outside Firefly's cult following and is completely accessible and enjoyable for those who have not seen Firefly.Serenity has interesting and distinct characters, witty dialogue, and a fascinating plot. The writing is infinitely far above that of most movies today; very funny, very intelligent. There is action for those who are into action, but it does not overwhelm the movie. There is some romance, but it complements the plot as opposed to comprising the plot. There is sadness, but it's not complete despair. In general, this is a mystery story, and it is an interesting one. And of course, there are more of the strong and assertive female characters we have come to know and love in Joss Whedon's work.Caveat: This probably isn't the movie for those who don't enjoy sci-fi/fantasy.

I will simply say this: Of recent Sci-Fi movies I have seen and enjoyed this is definitely towards the top. The art direction and script writing are some of the best (the attention to detail is astonishing), and Whedon did it all on 80 million dollars. Compare that the the giant gorilla sized piece of $200 million dollar poo and you'll see what I'm saying. This is a FAR better movie than the last three StarWars films and has the most well-thought out convincing world I've seen in a good long time.

1003,a-egger,No tears of joy for me.,1,29 December 2005,"I wanted to like this movie. But, as it turns out, the movie itself makes it impossible. Before I watched this movie, I had a nice candy-bar. That minute of chocolaty goodness was better than the entire two hours that followed. Every time I see a movie like Serenity, I wonder why people still invest in money-devouring projects such as this. But just for the jest of it, let's analyze why this movie was such an absolute dread to watch.1. Poor acting. Now, I realize Sci-Fi is a tough genre to act convincingly, but in all fairness to the genre, the actors in this movie did not have a clue how to bring a role to life. All characters are shallow in appearance and behavior and seem to have odd swings in ideology. Especially the blandness of the characters made the whole movie not worth my time.2. Poor screenplay. Let's say the dialog is ""marginal"", but the general attitude and choice of words lacks pragmatism towards the characters. In strong, solid characters you do -not- mingle in the way they say things or how they say it (this is related to the poor acting discussed before).A plot line is nearly non-existent, and yet directors seem to think they can spruce up a flat story with special effects. One joke an hour doesn't help the movie either - it pulls the movie into a really shady spot between comedy and semi-seriousness. Let's not even get into the time-line, because that's about as organized as a big plate of spaghetti.3. Mediocre cuts. I realize that Joss Whedon comes from TV, where he was very successful with Buffy. However, the sharp and nearly spastic way of cutting TV shows does not really fly in the movie world, that is if he had any creative control over this at all. I personally am a fan of old school filming (gotta love slow turns, steady shots, long scenes), but I can take the 'new era' filming. This ghastly affair however was too much to stomach.In short, I recommend the good citizens of the world to stay away from this movie. There's two hours of my life I'll never get back.",Serenity

Watching the series is not essential to enjoying this film, even though it does add some very helpful background info. Great script, great acting and no shortage of some very sharp social commentary. The special effects are pretty impressive, and it all goes together pretty well. As for special features, the disc is pretty well loaded with deleted scenes and outtakes behind the scenes stuff, etc. Well worth checking out, if only for a rental to see if it's to your taste.

Well done to everyone involved!! Well written dialogue and an engaging story are only two of the factors which make this film an instant classic. The actors portrayal of the characters with such grace and realism should inspire any number of writers to produce work such as this.We love Joss, and cant wait to see what he comes up with next as we are hanging out for something else intelligent that is not a bloody soap opera like smallville and the O.C. just to name a couple.Maybe he should relocate to the U.K. or Australia where fans appreciate the subtleties of the scripts.",Serenity
1006,randylance-1,Very surprising spontaneous DVD purchase for me.,10,19 January 2006,"This review is for those out there who haven't yet been introduced to Serenity and the TV series Firefly as I previously hadn't. And it's rare that I actually write a review for a movie, but in this case I feel it is necessary.It seems this movie has a good size cult following already and the size of its fan base rapidly growing. I'm sorry to admit I 'missed the boat' on the TV series Firefly and the theater release of Serenity when originally released/aired. But every Tuesday morning before work, I check out the New Release DVD section and end up buying 1-3 DVDs. On the particular Tuesday Serenity was released, Brothers Grimm was the only DVD I had picked out for purchase. But I really wanted a second DVD. I wasn't impressed with the cover artwork of the Serenity DVD, so I about passed on it not being familiar. After reading the back, I changed my mind and took a shot. I'm also an avid internet video gamer into World Of Warcraft, Halo etc. and much like when the movie Resident Evil was released, the plot had me intrigued in a similar way and I took a shot on it. I'm so glad I did.The first 9 or so minutes of the movie are extremely captivating. Joss Whedon certainly made his point as the plot and scene were set. I always favor character development in pictures. Ones that I can identify with and like, tend to be at the top of the list for me. It's amazing how quick this happened early in the movie, giving plenty of time for the story, action, effects etc.Cast: very compatible with one another and so different. Mal is the perfect leader showing strength, compassion and also humor at times. Zoe is Mal's old war partner, female warrior afraid of nothing. Wash the ship's pilot, humanitarian, husband of Zoe. Inara the companion, witty, gorgeous and intelligent. Jayne has the brawn, raw masculinity and brute strength (but supports a female name of sorts). Kaylee the heart of the group, but extreme technical engineering knowledge. Simon the doctor, brother of River, both on the run. River (my personal favorite) a 90lb highly intelligent psychic/empath with uncontrollable actions and able to wipe out a room full of Reavers solo. And the Operative definitely adds an intense, mind blowing role but with somewhat relaxed vocal delivery.The only disappointment I have regarding this whole enterprise is that the Firefly series has been canceled. I truly want more and the people I am turning onto this movie and TV series are basically falling into the same desire. Maybe the series didn't have enough time to get all of us it needed because of programming, station aired or what have you. But this is a fantastic group of people produced by a brilliant producer worthy of notoriety, wrapped in a great story.Please give us more Joss!",Serenity
1007,dougdenada,One of the best movies ever! Sci-fi or not.,9,25 January 2006,"That's it really. No pot holes in the story. Nothing wasted or overdone. Great film making, great special effects. You don't even need to play catch up with the prematurely canned series. There better be a sequel that brings Wash back! They did leave enough loose ends to merit a sequel so let's have one! The fans got this movie made. I just played catch up after the seeing it, somehow It blew right past me like many other shows on Fox. Maybe The Sci-Fi channel will resurrect it. What were they thinking when the canceled this? It's truly one of my favorite movies ever, and I'm not a geek, That's why I'm posting a review on IMDb. Because I'm not a geek damn it!",Serenity
1008,david-2849,"A director with issues, but a rip roaring movie nonetheless",8,13 February 2006,"SPOILER - don't read this if you haven't seen it! Initial thoughts: not bad at all. It had me thinking back to Blade Runner mostly, but also Johnny Mneumonic, Brazil, Star Trek and, yes, inevitably, Star Wars. Summer Glau stole the show and would have done even if the story hadn't focused on River. That is one talented actress, beautiful too. Special effects were outstanding, as expected. So what first? Goods or bads. Let's do bads- since you asked ;) As a major fan of Firefly it's hard to criticise the movie incarnation of my beloved mini-series, but criticise I must. There were a few disappointments, to be honest. The move away from back country planets and wild west style basics to Uzis and Mini-guns was a mistake. I thought as much as soon as I saw Mal's new and modernised braces. The character development of Jayne, Inara and Book was wasted. A 'cryin' shame' as Mal would say. Clearly Whedon was trying to cram a few seasons-worth of story into the restrictions of a movie's runtime and chose to wipe out those characters he didn't have time to develop. Cowardly and reminiscent of the Aliens 3 debacle where half the cast of the previous movie were slaughtered before the sequel even began, just for the sake of continuing Ripley in an all new plot line - but even more reminiscent of Buffy, in which Whedon dispatched major characters with a wanton disregard for his audience. On the other hand, ***********SPOILER!! REALLY, I MEAN IT!******************Wash was a good choice for death. He was lovable, but had no place to go as a character. Letting him live would have been too smoochy, so I commend that particular wipe out, though Zoe's reaction was semi-baffling - a broken hero's leap onto the sword of honour (the ongoing theme I felt) but then a coward's reaction at the crucial moment? What was that all about? Whedon really has issues with women! Worst let-down? The plot was pocked full of holes. Does one measly cannon really p*ss off so many reevers? And while we're at it, if the reevers are so mindless, how do they maintain the complexities of your average space craft. Who does mechanics for these guys? Where do they buy their fuel? ""Uh, Ten Gallons of dat fuel stuff please."" ""Hey, aren't you one of those man-flesh-eating reevers?"" ""Uh, no. I just have a bad case of acne."" On the up side, Serenity was nicely updated. The lack of shaking and rattling in the Serenity of the mini-series always spoiled the illusion for me (impossibilities of artificial gravity aside) but the shaking of the movie ship was great. Same can be said of the lighting changes, with different lights and colours blazing through the cockpit windows. The first scene, a continual shot with no cuts at all and encompassing the entire ship from cockpit to storage bay was jaw-dropping. How many times, do you think they did that before they got it perfect! If Whedon deserves any credit it's for that scene. I was gob-smacked. The logistics of camera, sound, lighting, crew positions alone defy imagination, never mind the fact the whole scene started off in a violently shaking room! Overall I enjoyed the humour, a welcome continuation from the series, the dissection of Mal's tortured idiom, the visuals, the introduction of Mr Universe (who, I feel, would have been a major character in the TV show before long if not for cancellation) and the deeper immersion into the world of Firefly, most notably the Core planet sweeps and visits. Best of all? River kicking ass in a back-water bar of course! It made my spine tingle, but I maintain- Joss Whedon needs serious counselling regarding his attitude to women and their ass-kicking habits. To conclude: if you don't know Firefly, you won't know what's going on. If you know Whedon you'll have half a clue as to what to expect, and if you've seen Firefly, loved it and been spending the last few months dreaming of a return to the Serenity universe; welcome back :)",Serenity
1009,iccleone,Three years old and still shiny,10,8 September 2008,"I'm a newcomer to the Firefly the series and Serenity the film - however I think there will always be new people discovering this brilliant film and associated series. That Fox cancelled the series is beyond belief and it is fantastic that the film was made. We can only hope that there is still a chance a second series will be made - maybe in download format.The series is a Wester set in Space, dealing with the classic issues such as frontiers, love, honour and trust. However although technically sci-fi it steers clear of silly monsters and deals only with humans and human issues. My husband who never watches sci-fi and had to be bribed to watch the first episode of the series loved this show - which to me is a mini-miracle. The cast are instantly likable, interesting and at times very humorous. If you have not seen the series prior to viewing the film it is no big deal as there is certain amount of scene setting, enough to get you into the film, and enough clarification on certain matters to interest Firefly fans.The film keeps a good pace without feeling rushed and although not every character can be developed there is enough shown of each for you to get a sense of background and history.The special effects are excellent, not trying to be flashy but real and gritty. At one point a ship is spinning out of control and even though I was sitting on a comfy sofa I felt I needed to hold on tight.The film is a credit to director, producer, cast and fans. More please!",Serenity

1011,wiltedevergreen,Serenity: Best Movie Under the Sun,10,26 February 2006,"Serenity is one of my all-time favorite movies. It merges several genres smoothly and is engaging just about every way. Some Sci-fi movies are all about the special effects and the action but Serenity has interesting characters whose emotions drive the story. It is particularly relevant to our times and people from all political walks can enjoy it. The actors all have great chemistry and are perfectly fitted to their parts. They draw you into the story in a way where you feel like you know all the characters. This movie actually had me crying my eyes out in a crowded theatre. The sets are beautiful and expertly lit. Everything has amazing detail the camera work is great. The special effects are awesome. While it does have a 'fight the evil empire' sort of plot line it goes for the gray. The Alliance isn't evil. There isn't a definite 'bad guy'. The main characters are criminals and they're fighting against a government that has brought peace, medical advances, wealth and order. Another thing: it has a super-cool chick who can kick butt. In conclusion: if you haven't seen Serenity yet, you are missing out! Oh, and if you're one of those jerks who just likes to go against the crowd to be against the crowd, leave Joss Whedon out of it. He is a terrific film maker.",Serenity
1012,xyztun,"Never even heard of the show, but loved the movie!",10,19 March 2006,"I had never seen/heard of Firefly before I saw this movie. I didn't know there was a TV series until a few months later, actually. Lets just put it this way; I now own the movie and the series. This movie is terrific. The story is fascinating and complicated, the action is intense, and the characters are so well developed that it feels like you know them. I'm not usually a sci-fi person, so take my word for it when I say that ANYBODY with a brain will enjoy this film (unless they are incredibly sensitive to certain types of violence, or if they are young children). My only regret is the way it ended, and my regret deepened after I saw the series and got to know some of the characters better. How can there be a sequel with an ending like that? It broke my heart.",Serenity
1013,stephen-mooney,Can the hype be true?,9,29 March 2006,"A lot of reviews I've read of this film make the comment 'there's never been anything like this' or 'the effects are the best i've seen' and so on... Don't kid yourself - there have been films like this, there are films with better effects: but before you all start shouting at the screen calling me all the obscenities in the universe let me explain.... The thing that makes this film so special and that makes it stand out from the pack is that it is so obviously a labour of love and Joss Whedon has grabbed the opportunity to make a film with both hands and squeezed every bit of humanity and feeling out of the people involved. The difference and standout quality of this sci-fi film is that you really do care about the characters and you really do want each and everyone of them to survive. He obviously realised that out of all his TV shows, Firefly had the most potential to make it to the big screen and anyone who has ever watched Buffy, Angel or Firefly would have to agree. As good as Angel was (with arguably a better leading man) there was too much emotion and buildup and story arc over 1 season (nevermind 5) to do it justice in 2hrs, same with Buffy (although add the whiny teen angst rubbish into this - along with a leading lady who has all the sex appeal and acting ability of a small hedgehog) so Firefly was perfect - here was a show that was criminally cut sort but was still underdeveloped enough to make it into an action film that would appeal to the masses. And appeal it did - by the end of it everyone has their favourite character and everyone connects with them on a personal level. I won't go into details because I hate people who spoil the plot and this film really doesn't deserve that - in fact i urge you not to read any reviews that have spoiler alerts. The action is fantastic, the dialogue is funny and the people real - it is a film that has something for everyone. Do not be put off if you haven't seen the series it is based on - you don't have to have seen it (another plus - if it was Buffy or Angel you would be lost) Jonathan Ross (a film reviewer i hate) called it the best film he had seen last year and for once he was right - an excellent action/adventure/romance film. And like I said at the start the thing that raises this above other films of this genre is that you end up caring for the characters and In a world of film that just goes 'wham, bam, thank-you mam' and leaves you with nothing, its a great change to see an action film that you remember for a helluva long time afterwards.",Serenity
1014,dbate29,Impressive cure for insomnia!,3,30 October 2005,"I have rarely seen a film containing more plodding dialogue, cliché and pseudo-philosophy. Sometimes it seemed to be descending into self-parody. One member of my party fell asleep and, to be honest, a think he got the better part of the evening than I did. The main character was unbelievably stereotypical - gruff voiced, self torturing, suffering from a crew on the verge of mutiny, the list goes on. The action scenes were good enough, but it seemed to take such a long time for anything of significance to happen. By the time it got there, most of the audience seemed to have glazed over. I know I had. I'm sure Joss can do better than this.",Serenity

Otherwise this movie won't make much sense for you.The characters are well-written and well-rounded and I find the script to be fairly good.If familiar with the series 7/10, if not 5/10.",Serenity

But, when her brother takes her back, a hunt to keep the secretes she has locked in her head begins. When a life hardened space Capt. takes them on-board, he and his crew are forced to risk their lives, and the lives of those they love.If you like Sci-Fi, see this movie.

While this wasn't the BEST movie of 2005, it was certainly the one I found the most ENJOYABLE.I'm not a long-time fan; I've only just started watching the television series. I only got through the first four episodes before seeing the movie, but the movie stands on its own quite well. There are a handful of things that aren't explained well, but those items aren't critical (or even important) to the film. If you want a head-start on what's going on, watching the pilot episode is certainly sufficient.This movie worked on practically every level. The effects supported the story and were't ""eye candy"" like what we're used to from other big sci-fi franchises. The characters had depth to them, they were easy to relate to, and they pulled you in from the early moments of the film. The plot was good too, but really, the characters are what carries the audience through this movie. Joss Whedon apparently has a knack for believable characters, relationships, and dialogue that I wasn't aware of (and that, frankly, I wish George Lucas had).Not gonna win any Oscars. Still, it shouldn't be missed. This movie is, quite simply, FUN. And after all, isn't that why we go see movies? To have fun?",Serenity
1018,dis-5,Sci Fi with a plot and actual realized characters!,10,7 October 2005,"What an incredible film. No really. Best movie I've seen in a theater this year. Fully realized characters that aren't caricatures. Great dialog, incredible action and a plot! Crazy, I know. More than that, this is an action/sci-fi movie that is actually about something. Not telling what, you'll just have to see it yourself. This is why the first Star Wars (as in the 4th, A New Hope, the original, you know what I mean) was so good and such a hit, and this is better than that cause there's no whiny teenage boy as the star. This is like Star Wars, but with Han Solo as the star and yup, I did say this is better than Star Wars. That doesn't mean it now takes the place in my heart as my favorite film. But, Serenity is a better film over all. Probably won't make as much money, since you have to use your brain a bit to understand this one and keep up, but technique, acting and all that? Serenity > all Star Wars films or Star Trek for that matter, or really 98% of the movies currently made in the US. Definitely an A+. I know some folks won't see this because they think sci-fi is 'beneath' them. I also think some people need to lighten up, too many rules like that and one really misses out.",Serenity
1019,hamlette,Something for everyone,10,24 August 2005,"To preface, I am familiar with the origin series Firefly. I feel this movie pays homage to the TV show while becoming something original for itself. And for a new audience. Of course, I can't be unbiased or erase my knowledge of the source material, but I truly feel that non-Firefly fans will have no trouble getting up to speed and following the flow. What I loved most about Serenity was the dialogue. It's funny and poignant and scathing and witty and touching. It's everything you want dialogue to be. It's shocking and surprising. You think you're headed one way, and you get wrenched another. You can have your heart ripped out in the middle of a laugh, or you can find yourself chuckling through your tears. And what's dialogue without actors to deliver it? This cast of relative unknowns is superb, and they deliver Joss Whedon's words with precision. And these people have gravitas. They have presence. This isn't 'WB casting', if you will. These actors actually show emotion in their faces, with their eyes. They can deliver a line and mean it. In short, they can act, and act well.And like my title suggests, this movie will have something appealing for everyone. Action junkies will love this. Awesome spacefights, fist fights, gun fights, etc. All very well done and plausible. And also importantly, the people look like they've been in a fight afterward. Folks who like relationships and emotions will also like it, because the crew of Serenity have complex relations that are explored and expanded and tested and strained throughout the film. You'll get your heart broken and your belief in love will be reaffirmed, all within the course of 2 hours. People who like political undertones in their films will also like this, and I won't go into exactly why, but you'll get it when you see it. Western fans will like the tone and the attitude. A rough and gritty borderland(being space this time around) where unlikely heroes are made. Plenty of gun fights, a prostitute here or there, sadly though, no horses. Sci-Fi fans will love it because it does space 'right'. No sound in space, thank you! Also, the space ship fights are amazing. There is a particularly gorgeous one near the end that is on par with anything you'll see in Star Wars, and at a much smaller budget!Really, if you like movies at all, there will be something for you. And even if you don't like movies, this might be the one to change your mind!Keep your eyes peeled for Serenity in your area near the end of September!",Serenity
1020,cblanc-2,Film of the year!,10,20 September 2005,"Just saw a preview of this film, it blew me away. I loved the series, but this was just fantastic! Funny, exciting, scary and sad. Everything a good film should be.I don't want to ruin anything for anyone, so I won't lol, but I will say that many of the questions from the original series are answered and the film then adds some more. It also finishes in a way that leaves the story wide open for more films and / or another series. And if there is any justice in this world They'll make another, and another, and another (you get what I'm saying.I hope this film breaks through the $100 million mark with ease.Go see this now.",Serenity

Several surprises in store if you have not seen it yet. I think this was a wonderful way to bring the series to life on the bring screen. Does do a lot to tie up the story line. Sequel possibilities are there, but there are some good discussions on the Browncoats message boards about this. If you take people who are not fans or have not followed the series, there may be some confusion, but I think the movie did a good job of making this a stand alone for those that have not seen the episodes on TV.",Serenity

I've never been into cowboys on earth so I didn't see why I would like them in space. Turns out I was wrong. When I saw this movie I didn't have many preconceptions about it (except for the cowboy bit). To my surprise, I loved it! I thought the characters were interesting and real. The dialogue was witty and humorous. The storyline kept me riveted from start to finish. AND if I did have any other preconceptions, it was that I did not expect the production value to be so good. Amazing, actually. I recommend this movie to anyone. You don't have to already be a fan to enjoy this movie but I'll bet you'll be fan after watching it. I know I am.",Serenity

It's not sanitized like Star Trek -- there's no warp drive, no aliens. It's just us humans. Serenity escapes a rut that a lot of sci-fi television has gotten into. By discarding many stereotypical sci-fi elements, Joss has gotten to the heart of any good story: the characters. Serenity's ensemble cast is truly spectacular. The actors must have been born for these roles. When Serenity is over, you won't want to leave. You will be left wanting more, and this film is rare in that the fans have had such an important part in its creation. If Serenity does well in the box office, reaching $80 million, the sequels will get green-lighted. Take a chance and see this wonderful movie, it does not disappoint!",Serenity
1024,acfrabetti,Valor in the Age of Doubt,10,9 May 2006,"The beauty of this film rests in its philosophical temper.The world in which it unfolds is a reflection of today's world, in which the morals of old no longer bind us. The story is set in a future in which the Sun is no longer the center of our universe, nor is there an Earth on which one can ultimately feel grounded. The freedom to follow one's chosen convictions in the face of the absolute empty abyss of infinite Space - it is precisely this value above all that Mal, the ship's pilot, upholds in all his actions. His character lives existentially and authentically the world in which he lives; I as a viewer can identify with his struggles and his choices. None of his choices are clear, save those which arise from his fundamental convictions. Is this so different from our own world? Here is an individual completely centered upon his or her own reason and freedom, living without illusions.The plot of the film is grounded in this and is successful; even the mournful soundtrack reflects loss and interiority.It is no wonder that Firefly the television series did not last; it requires a public that authentically faces and truthfully questions the validity of its mode of existence. The average TV viewer is not that public.",Serenity

Joss Whedon not only produces amazing visual and action scenes but he makes the characters people that feel real. I love how he created focuses on every aspect of relationships between the characters & how peoples choices can change how you feel about a character. Really beautifully done, and I am glad I purchased this DVD without watching it prior... It is a must see - well a must have!I also appreciate how he doesn't use actors that are well known, it gives you the innocence of not having any pre-judgments about what the movie might be like etc. Because as we all know, sometimes we make judgements about movies before seeing them because of the actors.

I must confess I'm new to the whole Firefly universe.I don't watch much TV so I'd never even heard of the TV show. So until watched this DVD, to me,Firefly was nothing but a dumpy little American made car. I rented this movie with no expectations whatsoever; maybe that's the reason I enjoyed this movie so much.

Granted the plot isn't hugely original but then there really hasn't been an original plot since ancient Greek theatre, so it's a mute point in my opinion. There are some fantastic fight scenes, great chemistry between the characters and a swash buckling vibe that i haven't felt from a sci fi movie since Hans Solo. Fingers crossed for a sequel.

The questions raised by the kind a weird storyline are not to be revealed. There even are no unexpected changes in the story. The complete movie goes as you expect. Most major action movies make the awful acting bearable by adding some beautiful women and sexy moments.

I am generally not the least bit interested in futuristic and/or space related fiction, but I absolutely loved Serenity. The story line was fascinating and the trademark Joss Whedon humor was perfectly injected into an otherwise serious plot. After watching Serenity, I immediately added the entire Firefly series to my rental queue and thoroughly enjoyed every last episode. I was brokenhearted when it came to the last one, knowing that there would never be another. Now that I've seen all the backstories leading up to the storyline in Serenity, I think I just might need to watch it again.",Serenity

Serenity has a group of characters that you really get to like and understand.I would recommend picking up the complete series before watching the movie, instead of watching the series after wards like me.

Or eyes. Or something. O.K. O.K., I'll leave slick, even endearingly dorky, metaphors to the pro. The particular pro in question, Mr. Whedon, pulls off the difficult trick of giving old fans everything they could want in a grand climax for their beloved series (except maybe a little more humor and a little less sweat) and smoothly introducing new viewers to an interesting group of characters and a cool futuristic conceit or two without alienating either group. Is the film a richer experience if you've watched the series? Yes, go buy your very own Firefly DVD set now. But don't think you won't be in for a completely entertaining self-contained adventure if you haven't ever seen the t.v. version. The reasons the show resonated with so many people are the reasons the film probably will, too--tight storytelling, constant adversity/action, characters you can't help but root for. Joss, you've kicked George Lucas betwixt his nethers and sent him crying back to his FX lab...you should be ashamed for approximately 2.3 seconds, after which you should be extremely proud for the rest of your days.",Serenity
1035,peterfield8,Just a cool Z-Movie,6,3 August 2006,"This movie is just a cool Z-Movie, only this ! I'm very very surprised of the 8,6 on IMDb ! If Serenety has 8,6 , how much must be STARS WARS III ? ... maybe 86 ? But Serenity is not a bad movie, of course, but it's not this kind of movie about you can say at the end : WAOOO ! No, just a standard Sci-Fi story in a low budget movie. The special effects are indeed poor. But ... there is something special in this movie : the characters are enough ""amazing"" that someone can identify to one of them ... and I think that's the reason why a lot of people has liked this movie. For me, I repeat it, that's only a not bad Z-Movie. For example, A Sci-Fi movie like ""Enemy Mine"" is so much and so much better than Serenity, don't you think so ?",Serenity

This film has it all ... action, adventure, suspense, danger, treachery, secret romances and more than a few surprises for even us fans of the original series, ""Firefly"".Anyone with a love for great Science-Fiction or Action-Adventure movies, or even those who love great dramas will find themselves equally enthralled ... even if you're NOT a ""Browncoat"". The roles are extremely well written and the characters are well developed. Deep and intricate, the parts so naturally played and special effects so amazing that you forget you are watching a movie. This one feels real. Definitely a ""Must See"" ...",Serenity
1037,countlambert,Best movie ever!,10,13 August 2006,"This movie is really good and also very funny. The movie is just as good as the short lived television show ""Firefly"" from which the movie was based. It features great special effects that are not over the top and do not distract from the characters or plot. Breaks most movie clichés and yet has a charming corniness as well. Fans of westerns and sci-fi fantasy will all enjoy this picture. A mix of matrix-like martial arts and Han Solo wisecracks makes for a thrill a minute comedy adventure. After falling in love with ""Serenity"" I rented all 4 of the ""Firefly"" DVDs and I am devouring those as well. The lack of swears and very mild sexual content make this a film for all ages.",Serenity
1038,matthewmpa,rentable,7,16 August 2006,"I greatly admire the resurrection efforts that ultimately created ""Serenity"" out of the ashes of the ""Firefly"" pyre. It proves that the concept of ""Firefly"" struck a chord with many people. Further, ""Serenity"" is a triumph of popular will over corporate myopia.Beyond the side issues, I enjoyed the movie, especially how ""Serenity"" merged the Old West genre to space exploration. ""Serenity"" broke new ground in a number of areas, while telling the age-old tale of greed and corruption. The effects were sufficient; much to the moviemaker's credit, ""Serenity"" concentrated on spinning a good yarn rather than making your jaw drop with stunning visuals.However, ""Serenity"" had some problems; the dialog was contrived and often cheesy. I can't imagine anyone saying those lines in any age. The love story between the Captain and his ex...whatever is entirely undeveloped and frankly, uninteresting. Overall, it felt like a final episode of a canceled TV series instead of a feature film. ""Serenity"" simply failed to graduate to its potential.Summarily, I am glad that I rented ""Serenity"" because I did enjoy it. Yet, I am equally glad I did not spend 30 bucks (2 tickets and goodies) to see it in a theater.",Serenity
1039,ingenierojulian,How silly the producers think we are?,1,21 August 2006,"The 8 point something I saw for this movie is completely false. This movie is one at the top three of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The story is stupid and it's very sad to see those performances. How low can this movie gets!Besides this is a very boring movie, the special effects are disgusting, and the scenes are not elaborated at all. I even fell into a deep sleep during the supposed ""movie climax"".So, if you are thinking of having a good time watching a movie, don't ever think to watch this trash... This is a completely waste of time.I never knew if there was a story at all in this movie. From the beginning you will realize that this movie is a lack of respect. But what was a complete farce was the ""bad guys"" makeup: The Reavers. I don't know if Joss Whedon (the Director) thinks that we are stupid!!! This movie doesn't make sense at all!!!",Serenity
1040,monkey2000ad_t,A refreshing movie,8,14 October 2005,"I went to see this movie with no expectations and came out pleasantly surprised. While some aspects of the movie has similarities to other Sci-Fi movies, the special effects do not overshadow the plot. There are enough sub-plots to keep you entertained and while the main plot is a little predictable there are enough twists to keep you guessing until near the end.The US Civil War influences are very apparent at the start of the movie and there are some parallels with the current global political situation.Joss has managed to write a fair bit of comedy into the script which gives it a uniqueness. Don't expect this movie to be too serious.",Serenity
1041,baumanrm,One Man's Opinion...,10,18 September 2006,"I travel constantly, am out of the country quite often, and do not as a general rule watch science fiction since I stopped as a teenager. I mention this because after finding 'Serenity' on the cable listing and finally watching it (to be honest there was nothing else on I wanted to watch so I looked for something 'new' and the snippets I had seen surfing before looked ""somewhat interesting"") I suddenly found myself watching the movie whenever I found it on the listings to see more of it and now (only a month later) I have purchased DVD, gotten my fiancée to watch the show that spawned it (she hates Sci-Fi), we own the DVD set of the show, she made me pause it whenever she left the room when we watched the series after work, and here I am writing about it.

1042,e-brand,More intelligent than Star Wars,10,21 September 2006,"Much more than your usual sci-fi special effects blockbuster. This movie is about believable characters just trying to make a living, and discovering something that cannot be ignored. It is intelligently written and very well cast. It takes place a few months after the TV show ""Firefly"" ended, and completes the story of some of the cast characters, but leaves it open for a sequel. There are some very good special effects, but it does not rely too heavily on them to sell the movie. It is actioned packed but should appeal to both sexes as well as a wide age range. It helps to have seen the TV series, but this is not strictly necessary, as the movie fills in all the blanks without repeating itself.",Serenity
1043,nettihuuto,Good scifi - but not Whedon's finest,7,13 March 2007,"There's a couple of things you need to know before watching this movie to enjoy what it has to offer.First of all, the IMDb rating is off. It's not THAT good. But it certainly is worth watching if you like scifi at all - do not skip this one. Give it a chance.If you haven't watched Firefly and in general are NOT a big fan of Joss Whedon's previous work, you'll probably enjoy this as a slightly above average scifi movie. Nothing earth-shattering here - just some good action, a touch of mystery, space battles, rough landings and nice CGI. There's barely any story really, or character development for that matter: just plenty of action both in space and on feet, some goofy one-liners (albeit too few and far between) and a plot that you will see take it's unsurprising twists a mile away. But having said that it's one of the better scifi romps to come out in quite a few years. I'd rank this one right up there with Equilibrium in terms of being entertained. To some extent the world lives and breathes which is something that cannot be said of the Star Wars prequels for example.On the other hand, if you really like Whedon's work with Buffy, Angel and Firefly you may be in for a disappointment.The writing is darker and simplistic. There's far too little comedy elements and practically no emotion. What really bugs me is that the characters that were so alive in the Firefly series --- you could feel what they were thinking much of the time --- they have all been dumbed down. In Serenity its like watching cardboard cutouts most of the time: a great deal of the depth of emotion and humor that defined the characters in Firefly is gone. They don't seem to care about each other anymore, they hardly interact and you'll find yourself wondering what the hell has happened to these people to make them all so negative and gloomy. What characterizes this movie is a tangible lack of positive energy. A shame really.Having watched Buffy and Angel you'll know Whedon tends to kill of key characters towards the end of a series. Such deaths in this movie are pointless and abrupt. Other characters' reactions to these deaths just underline the greatest problem of the movie which is an nearly total lack of any emotional impact. They just seem to get a bit more angry and continue on their already gloomy ways. There are glimpses of the Whedon genius but they are too few and far between, and really just glimpses. This could have been much, much better.In a way this is like a first, stumbling episode of Firefly Season 2. You know there's great potential here but alas we will never see that realize.",Serenity
1044,myecoll,What a surprise!,10,30 September 2006,"I just lucked into watching Serenity and boy was I lucky. I did not see a lot of publicity for this movie. So I am figuring a lot of people missed it in the theatre. The story, the acting and the action were SUPERB! I enjoyed this movie so much, I have watched it four times now. Every time I view it I see something that I missed before. There are a lot of actors that I had never seen before, and I am wondering why they are not bigger stars. The movie was compelling. It was also a great story with a lot going on from beginning to end to keep you glued to the screen. My only regret about this movie is that I didn't see it in the theater. Watch it, you won't be sorry.",Serenity
1045,chrisrichards-38432,A fine send off to a season of promise...,9,23 September 2020,"Firefly and Serenity both hold a special fragment of my heart. I must admit that my rating has a lot of bias based on the fact that the exploits of Mal and his ragtag bunch were a regular haunt on the living room screen at our house. A regular watch and re-watch between my Dad and myself.My father was a movie nut and he raised us on old black and white films, Star Trek and Westerns. Westerns, especially. That is the spirit of Firefly/Serenity to me. It is a Space Western at it's core. Done so right it brought genuine joy into our living room. My father and I watching Mal(latin for bad) lead his ragtag bunch of fringe explorers into parts unknown. Walking that anti-hero line as fine as they dared, yet always doing the right thing at end of mission. They always combat roll out the other end, bright and shiny. Not to fret. Yeah, there is a whole lot of sentimental attachment for me here.Sentiments aside, it is the richness of the characters...the personality, the diversity of the cast. The dialogue blending of Chinese slang into what we D&D nerds dub, Common Tongue. Little details peppered throughout appeal to all sorts of fandom. It has so much charm and likability. The beauty is in the details and you can see that Firefly/Serenity is an absolute labor of love on the creators front. There is a lot to love about this movie. And if you have never seen the ill-fated, yet highly revered series that preceded it, you are missing out on a universe of lore, love and character building leading up to this movie. Get you some Firefly. Aim to misbehave. It will help you fall even more in love with this cast of characters.Look at it this way...Firefly was cancelled after one short season. The fanbase outcry and the tireless efforts of Joss Whedon and folk are what brought us, Serenity. Unheard of. A big budget, Hollywood movie to close out a first season cancellation. Think about that.Watch Firefly first. Then Serenity. It may not be the rack on which you dreamed of hanging your brown duster, but it helps. And sitting here tonight watching this movie, I am content. My fathers spirit, I like to think, is next to me enjoying the escapades as much as I am.",Serenity
1046,lunker-1,A Movie For Intelligent People,9,30 November 2006,"I have to say, while reading all of the negative reviews here, I was merely confirmed in my observation that most people are idiots. Quite frankly, if you don't get this movie, good on yer, go back to watching the standard mono-syllabic fare. What this movie provided was a non-standard, shades-of-gray character study. The focus was not on big-budget effects, or glitzy bits of teeny-bopper fluff. It was about a story. It reminded me of how I felt when I watched the REAL Star Wars (not the fake stuff that is out now). People have different ways of handling things that challenge them mentally. Some are able to incorporate the new perspectives into their lives, while others call it ""boring"" or ""seen it"" when all they are doing is protecting their two fragile brain cells from expansion.How can I make such bold, perhaps even abrasive statements? Well, let's look at the movie itself. It starts off with a brief recap to get those people that had not seen the TV series up to speed. This was brief, and incorporated a look at River's past, which was well done. It then moves on to show the rescue, seen from the perspective of the Operative. I will concur with those that argue he is not a cookie-cutter villain. He is not a ""black and white"" archetype. He is a ""believer,"" but is also exceptionally self-consistent with his beliefs. He is doing what he does for an altruistic (in his mind) goal, completely devoid of ego. There is no room for self-aggrandizement, we see no hubristic monologues, just a single-mindedness of purpose to create what (he is told) will be a perfect world.That brings us to the crew themselves. Let's get one thing straight, though many have said they are by default ""good"" because of their eventual choices, what makes them interesting is that they are, for the most part, amoral. They are Privateers, ex-soldiers from a cause that was just, true, and pure- and that lost to the ""good guys."" Each of them is a part of the crew because of their past- Mal, who used to have something to believe in, now just believes in his ship and his crew. The vacuum of space is cold, and there is no room for anything that does not keep his crew alive. Some have argued that he is good because he did not kick River and the Doc off on some backwater in the beginning, but I think it was mostly pragmatic. Here he has a doctor that can patch his crew, a valuable skillset, and a girl that is obviously worth something to the Alliance (worth keeping on general principles). This is not to say that he is not conflicted. Mal is someone who WANTS to do the right thing, and we see that when he can, he does. But he is not some goodie-two-shoes paladin bunnies-and-duckies character that will ALWAYS do the right thing.The interactions of Mal and the Operative are interesting because they ARE both very similar. They are both living in the interstices of society- the Operative realizes that he has no place in the ""polite"" ""fairplay"" world that he is striving to resurrect while Mal is a scofflaw- neither are fighting or living for ""normal"" motivations. It also shows that both are capable of change, which pretty much knocks the normal Hollywood plot line off the tracks- in most movies, people will never change, and good defeats evil, then comes home and snogs the prom queen. Mal, and his crew, are given a choice, and have to each come to terms with what they are really fighting for. It requires them to strip off the veneer of being privateers, and allows them to recapture their original selves. I am simplifying greatly here.Ultimately when Mal defeats the Operative, he spares his life, showing us that Mal is not the typical hero, and that he also recognizes the bigger picture- the Operative is not the villain, merely another dupe of a huge machine that wants to control people because ""it knows better."" This is another non-typical outcome, and delves into another level of complexity.In closing, I want to acknowledge that this is not intended to sway those that don't like this movie. Barring a serious shift in perspective, they never will like it. And that is fine, wonderful actually. This movie did not compromise its core message to appeal to a wide audience, it did not focus on flash over substance. It simply told a story that makes you *think.*",Serenity

I like to go into it with no outside influence. First off... completely B rated cast! And I'm not just referring to the other movies these actors have been in. No I'm talking about they're performance... PATHETIC! Absolutely NO character development... (I can understand this movie was made for fans of the show) but marvel movies were made for comic fans and if you never read the comics no worries every thing will be explained. I literally had no clue what was going on the whole film... how did the girl get her powers... where did her and her brother come from??? Who is in charge of the ""alliance""??? And I DONT care if all of those things are explained in the show!!! This is a movie!!! If it was only made for fans of the show that's pretty stupid considering the show obviously wasn't that good because it didn't even make it past the very first season... I had no connection to any of the characters... the captain was a total ripoff of Han Solo!!! But not as a equal.. it's more like watching a no talent loser person with Down syndrome dress up like Han for Halloween... I seriously could barely make it through the whole film... if anybody other than my girlfriend who I love very much tried to get me to watch that weak derivative unoriginal piece of trash film I would of fought them in the streets with in the first 30 minutes of that ugly waste of my time excuse for a film... in short I wish I never saw it only because now I officially have a movie on my list I'd rather eat spaghetti off a hospital floor than watch for a second time....",Serenity
1051,sipathador,A Satisfying Conclusion to a Notable Series,9,30 April 2021,"The series ""Firefly"" is a cult classic that has its place in the hearts of many cinephiles. The unfortunate cancellation made this movie a long awaited promise, and the promise didn't disappoint.Serenity is a ""perfect"" movie. While the technical aspects aren't necessarily Oscar-worthy, Joss Whedon brought an ideal conclusion to a beloved tale. The movie is well paced, has engaged characters that are even more-so if one has watched the series, and dangles just enough fandom candy in front of movie-goers to create satisfaction without smothering. Nathan Fillion and Chiwetel Ejiofor play off of each other in an engaging dynamic, all centered around the powerful theme of belief. The action is well done and intense, with comedy that alleviates the pressure when necessary. Characters aren't invincible, and the budding relationships in the series come to a uniquely satisfying conclusion.The movie isn't revolutionary, preventing it from getting a 10/10, and there could be improvements to the technical elements of the film, but as a Firefly fan this was a satisfying watch that accomplished everything I desired.",Serenity
1052,docpierce,Excellent!!,10,2 October 2005,"Wow, I was wondering how well they would do translating the TV series into a feature movie, but it was done excellently.

I would have thought Buffy would have been the first movie he would have made out of a series, but I am definitely glad that was passed on and Serenity was given a chance.

However it has been fun to see how creative some writers and artist can be, including the music being writing, some of it seems as if it was somewhat personal rather than just being created because it was a job. Since we became hooked on the Sci-fi we have been following the B.S.G. Series. We have become junkies every sense Baltar and number six have been making the episodes so hanging off your seat. We are official cylon junkies. So glad that Battle Star has been doing so well for most of the time.

First of all I didn't know about the TV show, and one thing for sure is that I don't want to know ! Everything is over rated about this movie. Everything. The plot is childish. The special effects are simply OK, expected better. The actors are so bad, man, they are so bad. Specially the leading role which is quite annoying. River is one of the most depressing performance I have ever seen I think. I feel so bad for the actress. I still haven't figured out what Inara is doing in this movie. Mr Universe is a joke. Only the guy playing Jayne deserve to be credited. ******spoiler****** If someone can explain to me why after receiving a bullet in the body, and a sword in the stomach, and then a few decisive kicks, the main character is ready to take part in the Olympics, healthier as ever.

This movie has the A- list, those supporting actors with talent, and wow, watch them do their thing.It's science fiction but not high science fiction. You'll understand it, even if you don't like Science Fiction, and very likely you will enjoy it. But where Star Trek is a science and plot driven thing, Serenity, like the Firefly TV show it comes from, is driven by the characters.And you'll laugh at them, with them, suffer with them, and I clicked spoilers because, yes, people die in this movie and people are injured, seriously, and it's not the typical everyone gets out of it alive and well.If you understand how a movie works you will love this movie. if you don't, you'll still love this movie. Over half the people voting for a score gave it a 10 out of 10 on this site. There's a reason for this.

1057,augres,Better than most of the TV episodes,9,1 January 2007,"Only a couple of the TV episodes of Firefly, rivaled Serenity. Great work by all involved considering their budget and constraints. The beginning was to me, bit hard to follow, but it all came together nicely during the film. Having just finished the 4 DVD set of Firefly, I saw the tie-in's to the TV show, and it was a good vehicle for the talents of Josh Whedon and the cast. I've been told that if you haven't watched the TV series, (or DVD's), that the story line can be a little difficult to follow. (Having seen them, I'm not really qualified to comment) But, I believe I would have enjoyed the movie almost as much, had I not previously seen the TV series.

1058,waymill1,"Serenity is a good movie, but departs from the feeling of the series.",8,29 December 2006,"First of all, let me say that I am/was an ardent fan of the Firefly TV series. It absolutely amazes and depresses me that such an unbelievably well-done series would be canceled in its first season. This fact says a great deal about the artistic tastes and foresight of those who run the networks.With regard to Serenity, as a movie by itself, it is excellent in many respects. Its characters are rich and their interactions are filled with emotion and humor. The pacing is excellent and the graphics are first-rate. You never feel that you are watching a digitally enhanced film.Nevertheless, I felt that the movie departs in several respects from the feel of the television series which I loved. First of all, in the movie, the main characters (especially Mal) are much darker and more vicious than they were on television series. For example, in one TV episode, Inara tells Mal that the Madam, Nandi, who ran a bordello, kept her ""family"" together with the strength of her heart and will, with the implication that Mal does the same for the crew of Serenity.In the movie, however, Mal comes across as much more heartless and authoritarian. Until the very end of the movie, Mal never reaches out to his crew members, nor does he make much of an effort to communicate with them, or understand their individual situations. He is also much more cavalier in his treatment of innocent bystanders.Additionally, although there is humor in the movie, there is much less than in the television series. Is this Hollywood's effort to show that the movie is a ""serious"" cinematic event? Whatever the reason may be, the movie makes a determined effort to show that this is not simply a light-hearted, swashbuckler, but is a dark and brooding dramatic endeavor. Insofar as it departs from the joyful spirit of the series, I feel that this is a mistake.",Serenity
1059,mlangdown99,Great Sci-Fi spin-off of the US Series Firefly Worth Watching,10,1 January 2007,"I am hoping there will be a new film or series of Firefly, which could take the place of Star Trek on the Sci-Fi stage. I like the film with quirky humour and the lived in feel of the Alien series. The Acting is good with the actors working well together which is one of the main reasons I believe this comes across as being a highly watchable film. OK so no sci-fi acting or props can be 100% believable, but this works well for me in this film bearing in mind the vast scope of the film and effects required. I only discovered the series by chance, which I find amazing, and am now a devout fan to this one-series TV production and film. Standing with the Alien series and Event Horizon, which are both in the shock/horror Sci-Fi league unlike Serenity, this is a the best Sci-Fi film I have seen of late. I would recommend this film to anyone interested in the Sci-Fi genre, in fact I would go as far as to say that this should be compulsory to anyone who watches Star Trek or Aliens! This really deserves a sequel. I cannot understand why the TV series was cancelled after one series, after watching the Film I would recommend people watch the TV series.Long live Joss!",Serenity

The plot was excellent and the actors made a very well balanced team. Every one of them had a personality, every one of them had a contribution to the story.

1062,michael_rogers-1,One of the Best SciFi Movies,10,8 January 2007,This movie caught me by surprise! Serenity is something the last 3 Star Wars movies should have been. It kept you interested and provided a realistic view of a world that mixed Chinese and English in their language. Created characters of depth and strength that you don't see in the neat and clean Federation (Star Trek). Serenity is a roller coaster ride. It grabs you from the start and takes you through a universe of great characters and wonderful evil villains. The women are strong and can take charge. The fight scene at the bar was spectacular and was orchestrated to perfection. I don't think I want to get that 90 pound girl upset. This is something I will own on DVD. I purchased the FireFly TV Series immediately after leaving the theater. It was great!,Serenity
1063,onkel444,This is a great movie,10,15 January 2007,"WOW, what a great movie, love it, and the FireFly too, a shame that FireFly have been canceled, hope that there will be made more of them both soon, it is a keep, so i'v just have buying the movie and the FireFly.Love the plot and story.So FOX, please continue to make Serenity and FireFly.Do not miss this movie, it is worth to watch, plain entertainment, and it have many fans out there.Here in Europe we haven't heard a lot of it, just notices around now, fans keep coming here.",Serenity
1064,doozer95,Excellent,10,8 October 2005,"An excellent movie - All I was hoping & expecting....and then some! The cast is superb & you've just got to love Joss Whedon for what he has accomplished. I was very excited about seeing this & was so glad it lived up to my expectations. I loved the back story for River & Simon, seeing the Reivers & of course the bits that shocked & I'm sure no-one wanted to happen! - answered a lot of questions I had, but, obviously some stones have been left unturned. Makes you realise how great the series would have been if the studios hadn't cancelled it! I wanted to walk straight back in & watch it again - I can't think of the last time that happened. Joss W did a brilliant job, can't wait for more!",Serenity
1065,osullivan-breffni,"For Firefly fans only, really.",6,3 February 2007,"I saw this film after a great deal of persistence by a good mate, who is a huge fan of Firefly and of Joss Whedon's work in general. Normally, I trust his opinions on films, but this time was different. He hails Serenity as one of the best films he's ever seen, and I really cannot agree with him there. I've only watched a couple of episodes of Firefly, and I was entertained, for sure, but it didn't grip me as much as it could have. It's a similar story with the film, only to a greater extent. Whedon seemed to be making the film exclusively for Firefly fans, which is fine, but he seemed to forget that the vast majority of people seeing this film would be people who are unfamiliar with the series. As a result, the characters are undefined and seem synthetic and frankly, seem as if they were plonked on the screen. I'm told you get their backgrounds from the series. This is the nub of the problem with Serenity. It's great if you love Firefly, and mediocre if you've never seen Firefly.I'm not a big fan of the sci-fi genre, but to me fair Serenity did seem more story orientated than effects orientated, which I liked. The cinematography was excellent, the dialog was witty and the action sequences were quite good. On paper, this seems like a very good film. In practice, I don't think it is. Whedon is a man who seems to be loyal to his fan base, and made the film accordingly as a ""tie up loose ends"" after thought to Firefly. To be honest, the story seemed labored and predictable (although some parts come out of the blue) and there are a few too many plot holes for my liking (they're probably explained in Firefly).Basically, for Whedon's fans this movie must seem excellent. As a casual movie-goer, I found it lacking. Whedon made this film for a dedicated fan base, leaving the average Joe a bit alienated. For me, this film nowhere near lived up to the hype. Then again, I'm not a Firefly fan.",Serenity

1067,kirkauvil,Mmmm,10,17 February 2007,"Serenity is an excellent movie based on an excellent series, Firefly. Cleverly written dialogue coupled with a compelling story makes this Joss Whedon film rise above the level of a good science fiction movie. Which brings me to the second great aspect of Serenity. Classifying Serenity as a strictly sci-fi outing is to do a gross injustice to the efforts of those involved with its creation. Serenity is a comedy, a thriller, a romance, and a drama all at once. Although some may say the movie is dependent on the lore of the series, Serenity is fully capable of standing on its own. Great movie. Great series. Tragically unsuccessful.",Serenity

The T.V. show Firefly is well represented in the movie, with more of everything. You only wish that the movie were longer to allow for the details the series allowed for. Performances given by Summer Glau and Nathan Fillion are outstanding. Morena Baccarin is stunning as Inara, Jewel Staite is sweet, these characters draw you in and leave you wanting more. Unlike many of todays movies, this film has good repeatability, you can view it over and over again and it remains a pleasure to watch.

1070,destructiveview,Greatest Sci-Fi in years,10,9 April 2007,"This movie is a good reason to have faith in summer movies. Most have all action and explosions but no character development. This movie takes the fun of a summer movie and dramatizes it.The story starts off with Simon(Sean Meher) saving his sister River (Summer Glau) from a military zone. Then enter in the ship Serenity. What is great about this movie is that it isn't about the fancy ship flying around to new worlds...if anything the ship is crap. The Captain, Mal Reynolds(Nathan Fillion) and his crew which includes first mate Zoe(Gina Torres), Merc Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin), Mechanic Kaylee(Jewel Staite), Pilot Haban ""Wash"" Washburne(Alan Tudyk), and Companion Inara Serra (Morena Baccarin) realize that on their ship River is a weapon if triggered. The movie is about the journey the crew, mainly the captain go through to find what they believe.It has it's action moments, it's funny moments, and easily the best part of the movie the dramatic ending.It is a movie where the ending can be viewed different ways as sad or happy. After the death of a character in the last half hour it leaves you feeling as if no one is safe. That to me is enough to give it an eight. For it to be a ten it had I feel a great message............if you have faith in something it will happen. --10 out of 10",Serenity
1071,anders60,Excellent Sci Fi,10,4 October 2005,"I know these characters. I know what the director will show me. And yet I am impressed. I enjoyed the special effects, but that was not the focus of the movie.The screenplay is excellent and the characters pop. No one can deny the back story's influence on the actions of the main protagonists. The directing satisfies the fans of the television show with quick cuts, superb effects and a respect for the actors that is rare in Hollywood today. Let us spend a few words and letters on the actors while we are at it. They are superb, evoking emotion and humor seemingly effortlessly, admittedly helped by the scenery and the back story. If you are already a fan of Firefly this movie WILL move you, if you are not, why are you pretending to be a fan by reading this review? If you haven't seen this movie and you are wondering, yes, it is worth $10 bux, yes, it is worth your time, yes, people other than you are still making great Sci-Fi for you and your kids to look up to.Don't forget what Sci-Fi means in the first place: ""Science is good, superstition is bad, but belief in goodness is the best thing""",Serenity

This show is about chacters,not special effects,and it is refreshingly different.I'm a huge fan,will buy the ""Firefly"" DVD set and ""Serenity"" DVD.The characters and their interactions are interesting,and while I like Star Trek and Star Wars,this type of series is more addictive to me,the characters seem to haunt me,I found myself chuckling at Malcolm Reynolds witty one-liners hours after the show.If more comes out,I will definiteley be watching and/or buying more DVD's!",Serenity

Set and setting remind me of Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared Syn. Scenes of the safe-haven kibbutz could have been shot right out of Earth 2. Had just enough mystical aspects to add flavor to a strict sci-fi tale, but not enough to detract from the larger tale. I especially enjoyed the ending...a good compromise from several 'happy' or 'sad' potentials.The actors seemed to really care about their characters, which seems a rarity these days.

Mac users will need to use Safari rather than Firefox or IE.I saw Serenity myself last weekend, and I fully intend to go back again next weekend. It's a very strong movie, and I think it would be even for those who had not seen the series.

1076,discstroller,Better than getting eaten by Reavers,10,17 August 2007,"Gather round me people. There's a story I must tell, about a TV series that didn't do so well. Firefly was a science-fiction/western centered around the lives of the nine person crew of Serenity, a Firefly class ship. Sadly the show was widely ignored, blatantly miss-aired, and poorly marketed by the Fox network. For this they will someday pay, but the people who watched the show and the people who made the show, roughly the same number of people, fell in love with it. And so they fought hard for a way for the series to gain some close sure even though it had been canceled. And it was picked by Universal Studios and made into one of the best science fiction movies of our generation. For more of the back story of the movie please watch Firefly, on to the film itself! The film, like the television series, is centered squarely on the crew of Serenity and their ever widening bad luck streak. It takes the time to tie up several lose ends from the series and still leave you wanting more. The acting is spot on as you can tell by watching they loved their time doing so. The action keeps making you wish the edge of your seat were more comfortable and in particular Summer Glau's performance during these scene {she does her own stunts for the movie} were impressive and for the most part realistic. For special effects the team put together some impressive works even giving Serenity {the ship} a brand new coat of movie polish. The ship combat looks good and the sounds in space are as high a quality as the show's were {there is no sound in space}. The movie strikes a good balance between the serious and silly as it takes you through the crew's flight across the 'verse and makes sure to keep all the characters human in some way, even the villains. A well acted, excellently put together film. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a movie with a soul.",Serenity

No one who sees it should be disappointed. And once you have, go buy Firefly on DVD, you also won't be disappointed. As a fan I am insanely pleased with what has been done with the movie, and I am in awe of how well Joss was able to make the movie enjoyable for those who have never seen the show. Hollywood needs more writers, directors and stars like this, who care deeply for their project and it's audience. I was beginning to think no one out there in the industry really gave a care about what people want to see, but that fact that this film was made shows that their are people out there who genuinely want to entertain and tell a story. These are the movies we should support.",Serenity
1079,kirbybadura,An excellent choice for home collections.,10,27 October 2007,"This is in my top 10 greatest Sci Fi films of all time, next to Blade Runner. It has a intricate and unique back story. An outstanding plot propels the characters(played by truly talented actors and actresses) through the painful discovery of themselves and their world. All the main actors/actresses have gone on to other endeavors demonstrating their amazing talent. Josh Whedon creates another spectacular tale of woe aptly named after the ship/home where most of the action takes place. The character development in this movie pulls the audience into the lives of people living on the edge. The actors bring the characters to life with performances that really tug at your emotions. The sets, costumes, props, special effects are all top notch. This movie has a high rewatchablity. Very few films transport you into another reality so completely. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes Sci Fi and Drama.",Serenity
1080,goneril85@hotmail.com,serenity,9,14 September 2005,"This movie is awesome. I was lucky enough to go to a preview screening where Joss Whedon actually did a question and answer session afterward. This movie was great. The characters were wonderfully realized, all the actors were brilliant. Appparently one of the actresses Summer (playing Riva) did nearly all the stunts herself and after seeing the movie I really have difficulty believing that because she is just so fast and so brilliant.Serenity is set five hundred years in the future and is based around the characters on a space ship called 'Serenity'. The members on this ship are very much like a family with their fierce extensive loyalty, and massive inner squabbles and bickering at points. They live in a world where the Alliance attempts to control all people and their societies. The story is based around the character Riva who was smuggled out of an Alliance facility where she was being used as a guinea pig for scientific experiments, by her brother. They then go on a smugglers ship, Serenity, where they believe they will be safe. However this situation may not remain so for much longer. I don't want to say much more and spoil the excitement of the story for anyone who wants to watch it, and hopefully all of you will.This movie is so many things, action, drama, horror, science fiction, western and above all is funny in an intelligent way. Joss Whedon doesn't go for the cheap laugh, everything he does just makes the characters seem more realistic despite the strangeness of their situation. I would really recommend this movie to nearly everybody, also the TV series 'Firefly' which it is based on and has the same main actors and actresses. The TV series and the movie both stand out from the crowd of other movies and TV shows.",Serenity

I was really upset when Firefly was canceled so you can imagine how thrilled I was when this movie came out. Serenity is amazing. The graphics are excellently composed and the characters draw you right into the movie. There were a dew things I didn't like. Inara's part in the movie seemed to be have written in just because she was in the T.V. show. She didn't seem to advance the plot much and after her first scene on screen, she had hardly any lines and they weren't significant we she did. Other than that minor detail, I thought it was well worth the eight dollars. I especially love how the ending left you feeling satisfied and how it didn't leave you with a ton of unanswered questions. It seemed like it was written as a completion to the T.V. show and not to make three or four movies that don't do as good as the first.

1084,KELLY-WARBURTON,Serenity - MORE of the best cinema made!,10,5 November 2005,"This movie is a BLAST!!! Joss Whedon's movie ""Serenity"" is more evidence that the movie-going public need not be force-fed retread remakes. His writing AND directing are on par with the upper echelons of the best that has ever been offered in the genre. Portrayals of all that is down-to-earth-cutting-edge, in the characters and in his realm, are enticing in their familiar freshness. All of this talent is expertly conveyed by ALL of the actors and actresses immersing into their characters, even the smaller parts.The plot, addressing the agency of mankind, is age-old and relevant on this new canvas. I do have one question: Why did planet Miranda's ""10%"" ignore the other ""90%"" and just leave them to fatal indolence? Editing is crisp, camera angle is engaging, and CGI completes rather than detracts. I love the ship and what it is able to do for its crew, and their use of ""other"" tools.I was an instant fan of the TV series ""Firefly"" and because of that knew then that it probably wouldn't last. I began noticing the trend when the TV series ""Nichols,"" starring James Garner, was cut short in 1971, ""Star Trek"" having lasted just three seasons. ""Briscoe County"" is another that didn't fit the formula because it was ""on the road less traveled,"" but provided real entertainment.We can only hope that ""Serenity"" is just the beginning of what Mr. Whedon has to offer!",Serenity

I mean, sure, there are some funny lines, and yeah, the dude with the sweet sword is bad-ass... totally bad-ass. But come on, first of all, the main character Mal or whatever is a complete Han Solo knock-off... secondly, the main guy that rescues his sister not only looks like a complete freak, but isn't in the movie at all.

1086,lilydel,An EXCELLENT continuation of a GREAT series!,10,2 October 2005,"I've never really considered myself to be a Science Fiction fan, but I am a Joss Whedon fan. While I loved ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", and I liked ""Angel"", I think ""Firefly"" was my favorite of the three. That's kind of ironic considering I wasn't too sure about ""Firefly"" at first. Like I said, SciFi has never really appealed to me. Then, I watched it, and I discovered that the space elements barely registered. They were simply another part of the story, in as much as the old west and oriental elements were part of the story. You just accepted them without question. In fact, of the three Whedon shows, ""Firefly"" was probably the most ""real"", despite the fact that it is set on a space ship. There were no vampires or demons, nor were there any of the usual alien creatures found in other Science Fiction movies. The characters were simply real, and they were the heart of the TV show. The same is true with ""Serenity"", the movie. The characters are what draw you in. They are well-developed and well-acted. The actors definitely know their characters, and it's apparent they truly care about their characters. The plot is interesting and fast-paced, and it ties up a few of the loose ends left when the series was prematurely canceled, while still leaving a few unanswered questions just in case! I truly enjoyed my two hours at the theatre, and I really didn't want it to end.

1088,Wineman13,"Flies higher than Lucas, Roddenberry and the rest.",9,3 October 2005,"When Firefly was originally on Fox I never bothered to see it. To be honest I thought it would be hokey, but the week before Serenity's premier I happened to be tuned in to the SciFi Channel and they had a marathon of Firefly playing, so I decided give it chance and watch one episode. I was hooked immediately; and, glued to the TV for the rest of the afternoon watched eight or nine back to back episodes. I have never been a fanboy for anything, and not one to fall easily for a series, especially an SF series - but this was excellent storytelling at a higher level compared to all the other schlock floating out there.I have been disappointed in the politically correct and uber fantastic direction most of the Star Trek franchise has gone and pulled my hair out over the masturbatory, fanboy drek Lucas has put out since the 80's, so I have always had a jaundiced view of recent TV forays into SF universes, but this one was different. The deftly crafted character development, humor, grittiness and believable science pulled me right into the Serenity 'verse. I loved it and was very pleased with the movie too.If you like the old fashioned values of loyalty and honor, heroes that can be ruthless and practical when necessary (""I aim to misbehave.""), mixed with a healthy dose of Old West sensibility and wonderful analogies to our own War Between The States (and our inherent love affair with the losing side ""The Independents Will Rise Again!""), this is a movie (and series) to watch and watch and watch.So, here's a big hat's off to the excellent cast and Joss Wedon. Let's hope they and Wedon are given the go ahead to do a couple more flicks and, dare I say, resurrect the TV series somehow.I am so happy to have stumbled across Firefly before the premier weekend and to have viewed it's own special 'verse on the big silver screen. I will be renting the whole series on DVD very soon, and suggest you do it too. You will not be disappointed.",Serenity
1089,strawberryJAMM,A crazy smart movie for crazy smart people,10,20 November 2005,"A crazy smart movie for crazy smart people and loads of excitement and explosions to boot.""Serenity"" starts off with an excellently played scene in a medical facility that starts things off with a bang and immediately gives existing fans of the ""Firefly"" TV series some crunchy new insight into two of the characters. From there, the plot moves quickly and precisely, as Whedon's well-crafted story lines are wont to do, putting the audience on an emotional roller-coaster as things go from bad to worse to {expletive}! There is just enough insight given into each character that the plot is handily carried, even if you've never seen a single episode of Firefly -- but do see some first if possible as the movie will have miles more depth if you've seen at least some of the, all too few, episodes). In my opinion, Joss Whedon is a giant in the playground of science fiction entertainment media, his only equal being Michael Straczynski of ""Babylon 5"" fame. It's too bad that the Fox network pulled the plug on ""Firefly"" well before its time - but then we wouldn't have ""Serenity"" if they hadn't - a silver lining I'll just have to learn to live with.If you're also a fan of Joss' other critically acclaimed TV series, ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"", keep your eyes peeled towards the end of the movie for River to hold a pose that is a reflection of the Slayer herself.See this movie - it's worth every dollar and penny you'll spend.",Serenity

Fans and non-fans of Firefly will love this movie. Great character development, awesome action, and great subtle humor mixed in. Have fun when you see this. Thats what it there for. I was impressed with how Josh tied the show together but still manages the story easy to be understood by someone who had never seen the Wrongly canceled Firefly. Although we see very little of some of the characters, you still get a sense that every one of them are important to the story in they're own little way. The new bad guy is played perfectly and gives you as sense we may see this dude again, (boy I sure hope so). Summer Glau shows that she is definitely a star in the making, along with Nathon Fillion. I'm looking forward to seeing these two stars in the future. As fan of good film-making I wish for others to see this as a joyride and NOT a political statement against big government.

Therefore when the film ""Serenity"" came out, viewers had little knowledge of its history. This made many people dislike the movie and Firefly fans were a little disappointed but, in my opinion, Serenity was awesome!!! I myself was a fan of the original series but I think when I saw the film the entire story stepped up a notch. I would indefinitely put this in my top 5 favourite films of all time. The cast are excellent, acting with real flare and the storyline does its former series proud. I'm sure that many fans including myself were excited with the revelations within the movie and how they unfold. Please see this film and spread the word of how amazing it is.",Serenity
1093,n2ikr,Traveller: The Movie...,10,8 October 2005,"Serenity is the best Sci-Fi action film since the original Star Wars! Yea, its not all that special when movies make me cry, but it is special when movies have me yelling at the screen in sympathetic reaction to what is going on in the film.Another high piece of praise from me - In the late 1970s there was published the first SciFi role playing game in the wake of D&D called Traveller. It was space opera at its finest. People asked me for years what playing Traveller was like. I always answered, ""Ever see 'Aliens?'"" Now I say, ""Ever see 'Serenity?'""The movie is perfect for fans of the series, of course, but it has been made well enough and stands alone enough that people who have not seen the series can enjoy this well crafted movie as well.See it.",Serenity
1094,justintyme,Everything that the Star Wars prequels were not,10,29 October 2006,"So, a week ago I rented the movie Serenity. I vaguely remember it being released in the theaters and having an interest in it, but never found the time to go. So I figured it would definitely be worth the rental.The only example I can think to give for how good this movie is would be the following: Think of a scale from 1 to 10. With 1 being the worst and 10 being the best. Now pick a number on that scale for how much you like ice cream. Now multiply that number by 2,000,000. That's how good this movie is.Okay, I'm exaggerating...but only by a couple of digits. Do you remember how pumped you were for that first Star Wars prequel to come out? Only to be disappointed by that cinematic piece of dung that hit the theaters.Well, Serenity is everything Star Wars was not. It's fun, it's exciting, it's edge of the seat, it's funny and it's clever...all in the span of 2 hours. The rest of what I have to say shows just how much this movie will leave you wanting more...I liked this movie so much (It'sin my top 10 now) that I watched all the special features, only to find out that GULP, it was a freaking TV show back in 2002! Firefly! Who the hell dropped the ball here and didn't get that show some publicity? So, I went to the local Circuit City and quickly bought the 1 season of Firefly that was produced. And now I'm heartbroken. Because in the span of a few days I tore through that season and it's like going from ""Wow, this is awesome!"" to ""Friends is over?"" I hate saying good-bye to shows that you attach to...and in a short period, this show did that and sadly, did not get the chance it deserved. (Fox decided to air the episodes out of order, put it in the Friday night time slot (aka TV DEATH) and didn't air the pilot which introduces the world and characters until after the show had been canned).This show should never have been canceled. How Star Trek can have a billion different spin-offs and Stargate can do the same, while a incredibly good show like Firefly gets the axe is beyond me. You quickly attach to these characters much like the original Star Wars, (they're all so real and all so unique) and the world that they've created grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go.This isn't your typical Sci-Fi movie or show. It doesn't get you bogged down in the mechanics of the world, or aliens or ships. It's a character driven show about people struggling with much of the same things we do now...only it's in the future, and in space...and dang it, give me back my ice cream!....err, show.The even crazier thing, is that from Whedon to the actors, they all loved doing this project. It wasn't just cashing a check, they loved doing this show. And they all want to get back to these characters and this world in anyway they can (hence, the reason why Serenity was made. From fans to actors to Whedon they all wanted to see more and Universal actually bought the rights from Fox to make the movie). So, if enough people learn about this show and support it, they've got everything lined up to bring it back. It's happened before. Fox (God, they've got some brilliant programing minds there) canceled Family Guy but it made it's way back on the air due to the public demand. I'm hoping for the same with this gem of a show.Alright, so here's your charge. Go out and rent the first disc of Firefly and see for yourself how good this show is. Then after you're hooked (and you will be), go buy the first season and the movie Serenity.Then sit back and enjoy. Then feel the grief of knowing that there's no more...even though everyone involved with its production (besides the network execs) want to make more. Then get riled up enough about this show not running its course and get everyone you know to do the above.And then go here... http://fireflyseason2.com/ Enjoy!",Serenity
1095,bobkipper,The most affective movie of all time.,10,9 October 2005,"Being a devout Firefly (the show whose story this movie continues) fan, I was looking forward to this movie with all the fervor of a child who had been told that Christmas was now a month-long affair or that Farrah Fawcett will be attending his birthday party. Please believe me when I say that this extraordinary film shattered my expectations in a way that I never could have imagined.Technically, this is a great film. The cinematic direction, the score, the acting (Oh, God, the acting), the sets and the script are all superb. There have been those that have likened the production of this film to a made-for-TV movie but I just can't see it. I've seen my fair share of both television movies and movie movies and this is a movie movie through and through.I won't lie to you and say that you don't need to see all of Firefly to fully enjoy this movie. Will you enjoy it without? Of course. You will probably love it as long as you enjoy science fiction, great stories and pure happiness but the emotional connection to all the characters, including Serenity herself, that will have been established by the series would enhance your experience ten-fold at least.Having that connection allows the viewer to experience every emotion that human beings have developed during our evolution into the creatures that we are today. You will laugh with these characters, cry with them, feel joy, fear, stress and anger as if you were part of Malcolm Reynolds' crew and standing on the deck of Serenity with everyone, experiencing the greatest ride of your life. It is this that makes it the most affective, and all-around awe inspiring, movie ever. I swear, I walked out of the theater a different person.",Serenity
1096,judah22,Better than Star Wars?,10,4 October 2005,"Being that I am not a fan of the series, (i've only watched one episode) and only seeing previews on the sci-fi channel, I didn't know really what to expect. Let me tell you it is much better than Star Wars. It kind of reminds me of the Original one not the Prequels where there was lots of action, and not so much drama, the battle scenes were excellent, the scene with the sword fight between the alliance guy and Malcolm, reminded me of Luke's battle with Darth Vader. The battle with space ships was a lot like the return of the Jedi. And how the alliance guy was so cool and composed and unemotional, was a lot like Palpatine. Anyhow if you haven't seen it do so, It is very much worth it, I plan on seeing it again this weekend.",Serenity
1097,jsun-16,A great Sci-Fi flick,9,19 July 2009,"I watched this movie a few years late. 4 to be exact and I wish I'd seen it sooner. It was a great movie with a good story and some excellent fighting and special effects. I especially enjoyed the spaceship battles. At some points the dialog or acting from some characters was sub par but not enough to affect my 9 star rating of the film. It goes in my favorites collection. In reference to the question ""Do I need to see Firefly first?""... I say no. I haven't seen the Firefly stuff and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I can't give an opinion based off of seeing those first but I also think that I may have had less expectations for the film because I didn't have some previous knowledge or standard to hold it up to.",Serenity

The actors does a great Job, and it really feels like it's the good old days when you could watch Firefly every week. Serenity is actually one of the best sci-fi movies I ever seen. It has it all, humor, thriller, action. And most importantly, one of the coolest spaceship-fighting scenes ever! This movie really deserves a 10 out of 10, and Joss Whedon really deserves a ""thank you"". I really hope he makes another ""Serenity"" movie, but this one has to make enough money for that too happen. So please, spend some money and go see Serenity, or buy the DVD, because it would be wonderful to see the gang ones again flying in space, and kicking some Federation ass.",Serenity
1099,infernal_jynk,"From TV to film, Serenity was worth the wait...",10,5 September 2005,"I don't normally comment on movies. In fact, this is the first time I've ever written one for IMDb, but I this movie is the first one that I've felt the need to voice an opinion for. I remember watching the show this was based on (""Firefly"") when it first came on TV and being completely immersed in this world Joss Whedon created. I identified with it a lot more than his other two shows. I stuck with the show till it's bitter cancellation, bought the DVDs when they came out, and followed all the news about the movie.My friend happened to get me tickets to an advanced screening and my friend and I made the 400-mile trek to see the movie, not really knowing what was in store for us. We waited in line with the other fans and rushed in when the doors opened (managing to snag very decent seats). The lights dimmed and the next couple of hours I went through an emotional roller-coaster: happy, sad, shocked, scared, angry, and a dozen other emotions. When it was over..I sat there, not sure what to feel at first. I wanted more movie, more of my beloved characters. That seemed to be the same reaction throughout the theatre.Serenity is the best movie I've seen in a long time. As someone that doesn't enjoy movie theatres anymore (cell phones, noisy kids, etc.), I will be making a point to see this on the day it is officially in theatres and probably a few more times while it's there. This movie deserves recognition for being the first original thing to come out of Hollywood in years along with having characters and a plot you can believe in.There really aren't enough words in the English language (Or Chinese, I guess) to express how much I loved this movie and how much I recommend it. Any scifi or western fan, even if you're a fan of movies, go see this movie. Go. Go. GO! Whether you love it or hate it (not likely), it will leave an impression on you and it is worth watching.",Serenity
1100,Diesel2k,Can't Stop the Signal,9,30 September 2005,"I've already written something down on the message board, but I have a lot more to say. I read a comment there from someone who hadn't seen Firefly but went to see Serenity. He said that Serenity was more for the Sci-Fi Channel rather than on the big screen. I've thought about it a little and I'm sure it would've done well on Sci-Fi, but I'm also of the thought that this person just doesn't get it. (BTW, there wasn't much of a back-story to Star Wars: A New Hope, but people still got it with what little was told).This was fan service. In the rough cut/preview showings they had, Joss stated that this movie was for us, the Browncoats. For the fans who believed in what Firefly was all about. I am a fan of Star Wars and Star Trek, have been since I was very young. Firefly is this generation's version of the previous two. It's intelligently written, innovative in the style and format, the characters are full and rich, and, like the aforementioned two, were underestimated and unappreciated by the businessmen of Hollywood. ""They"" thought that Star Wars would be a flop; ""They"" thought that Star Trek was cancelled and gone after its third year; ""They"" thought putting Firefly on Friday and showing the series out of order, it would just silently go away. Well, we, the Browncoats, will not fade away.The general movie going audience might dismiss this as just another sci-fi movie. And I'm sure that some fans will love the movie and take it for what it is. I'm sure other fans will probably not like what happens, (like my girlfriend who was in total and utter disbelief and shock with Wash and Book's deaths). But this was a movie that wasn't supposed to be made. Now that's something! This was not only for Joss, the cast, or the studio, this was for us. I get 'it'. It's different for everybody, but I get what Joss Whedon was saying with Serenity. At the end of the day, good or bad, all you can do is keep going, keep believing, keep fighting in something, anything: whether it be religion, your work, your ship, your fight to survive, your government, someone you love without limits. The Message was to me, 'Keep fighting for something that is right.' I'm not saying this will make a hundred million dollars (although that would be extremely nice!!!), but this was for us, for the Browncoats. Like Angel, it didn't give us a happy ending or that much in the sense of closure (that's what Joss does). It gave us a chance to flying with the crew of Serenity in another adventure, in the good and through all the bad. Revelations and shocks galore, but at the end of the day, the end of the job or mission, with bullet and swords wounds, as well as unexpected deaths, faith and doing the right thing (though not the lawful thing) is what gets people through heartache, suffering and loss. We lost something potentially great with the cancellation of Firefly. Serenity gave us something, something to believe in that can get done if we want it badly enough.Joss did a hell of a job, with a $40 million dollar budget (pretty cheap for a sci-fi flick) and the faith of a Universal executive who saw the DVD sales. Just as I thought Firefly was so much better than Enterprise, pound for pound, against Star Wars 3, this movie was the underdog and in my humble opinion, as a sci-fi fan for life, this movie won hands down! At the end of the movie, I stood up and cheered. This was definitely worth the wait. It is The Big Damn Movie! Keep Flying...-B",Serenity
1101,kromagon,Nerds rejoice!,4,15 December 2005,"This movie contains every cliché in dork life- people who just can't fit in turn out to be special, and the people picking on them are just jealous. Throw in a little new-age religion, while taking a swipe at more conventional ones. Whedon's entire career has been telling essentially the same story over and over again. His only innovation is making sure its the girl that gets all the good kung-fu moves.The acting in this movie was extremely wooden. Most of the characters had 3 or 4 expressions to choose from. The dialog was equally absurd. I understand what Whedon was doing, and making this universe seem familiar and alien at the same time is a difficult thing to accomplish. But the neo-western mixed in with tired Matrix clichés was usually just hard to understand. Sometimes, he gave up entirely and just had them speak Chinese. The actors seemed to have a hard time keeping a straight face 1/2 the time.The cinematography was outstanding, though. They also did a very good job with the CGI. The music was appropriately understated. And the story, as terrible as it was, flowed well.",Serenity

Cinematic storytelling excellence, with nary a second of screen time wasted.Characters I believed in enough to laugh when they laughed, and cry when they cried, who could ask for more?. Joss Wheedon knows that people will respond more to real dialog and real characters more than they will ever respond to fancy special effects (though Serenity does have some impressive special effects, that shaky hand-held CGI trick never gets old). Ironicaly enough, the one single low point was the epic space battle scene, something that would be the highlight of just about any other space opera I can think off, and yet here it just got in the way of me as a viewer spending quality time with a cast that I felt I knew as if they were real people.In these days of big budget soulless cinematic monstrosities, Serenity is a little film with a big heart that will make you fall in love with it.",Serenity

I am a huge a fan of the TV show that was unjustly cancelled, and was extremely excited that there would be movie version. I was not to be disappointed, great dialogue, great characters and great story. This is the film that Mr Lucas could only have dreamed about making with his recent Star Wars offering. My hope that this movie will enjoy the success it richly deserves, two other movies are planned, and I hope that either a TV show or TV movie specials will come from this. I sat with people who had never seen the show, and they all agreed what a great movie it was.

Therefore, please discount any of the above thousand reviews who seem to want to refer to these two points with the film in question. I am basing my review solely on what I have seen, if that is allowed. I am a fan of good films in whatever genre they appear and this is a corker. I must admit to a sense of ""Oh yet another TV movie"" in the first few minutes but then I was hooked. The direction is brilliantly conceived, the editing slick, the characters are well stocked and the storyline transferred from classic westerns to the future as to be totally believable. In short, I was impressed.The danger with this type of film is that it turns out to be a run-of-the-mill or by-the-numbers film and it is totally not that. The Special Effects are there to enhance not to dominate, the acting is top notch and the ideas are actually quite intelligent. If they could have cast the baddie any better I await enlightenment. The whole film reeks of cleverness and I would urge anyone who enjoys watching something to make you think whilst at the same time rooting for characters (the whole point of any story) to take the time to get through the tedious credits at the start.I've no idea who Joss Whedon is, what the F Firely was but this is a very good film.",Serenity

Did Fox canceling Firefly just drive him mad?From the opener to the end it seemed more a fever dream of River's, not something that would be happening in the Firefly 'verse.I was shocked when River didn't wake up at the end and none of it had happened. Joss didn't really think this was a good plot?And what sense is there to be made of the fates of some of the characters? Did he not think there would be any sequels? Gee, Joss. Thanks for the vote of confidence in your fans.I know Serenity is not Firefly. But if it's not Firefly (as the ""get over it"" crowd keeps telling those of us not happy with this movie), why not just do a complete reset of the 'verse.

Having completed it, I'm really shocked and awed to see that it has attained over an 8 (what?).Perhaps I'm biased. I am not, like most of the reviewers, a to-the-death fan of firefly. I hate T.V. I hate T.V. because 90% of the time the stories just suck. To boot, you've got commercials, but I digress.I don't know what to start with and feel like elaborating too much would be a waste of time.The writing sucks. I could have predicted over half of the lines in this movie.The art direction sucks. Just look at the typeface they used for the title.The characters suck. I found myself apathetic to every character in the end (except maybe Jayne because, come on, it's Animal Mother).The direction sucks. This guy does not realize that film is a visual medium. He can't go ten seconds without some character breaking out into some prophetic speech about human nature.I love Sci-fi. 2001 is my favorite movie. Clarke is my favorite author. Perhaps I'm being too harsh by holding this movie up to those standards but come on, an 8.1? Get it together. This is not good cinema. This is a long T.V. show with no commercials. Not that this would necessarily lend itself to bad material, it just happened to in this case.Don't believe me? Watch it for yourself.

Its a good movie and the plot is interesting and unique but this movie is not epic. The cgi was very impressive. The scenery, although computer generated, was breathtaking. The characters were real and complicated. It has the elements for a great movie but not an epic movie. Serenity reminded me of an animated series called Outlaw Star. The similarities include the space setting, the rag-tag crew, a genetically engineered female, a person that finances their operations, and the characters always running from the law. The only difference between the two is that Serenity has zombies and Outlaw Star has pirates. This movie is good but not epic.

But I do like a good movie, and its been a very long time since there has been a decent SciFi movie which is why I walked into Serenity without the highest expectations. But the previews looked good enough to drop $8. I was not disappointed.I've read some of the poor reviews by some of the others and can't understand why some of them couldn't follow the plot. Not to be rude but if you can't understand whats going on half way through the movie, then it's you, not the story telling.I was drawn into the story I think it was well written, and had the strongest character development in any SciFi movie since...well a very long time. I thought the dialog was well written and the acting reflected this, well except for one spot where it was a bit overdone. It's the one part of the movie where felt disappointed, one short, 2 minute scene that should have been re-shot, but now I'm being picky.The action, is of course, very well done. The space battle scenes were impressive and brought back the feelings I had watching the original Star Wars. But it was the character development, the acting, and the story that made this movie really good, not just the action.Let me put it to you this way, after seeing this movie I will buy the 'Firefly' box set and will surely by the 'Serenity' DVD at first opportunity. How refreshing to see that there are some people who can create a SciFi series that isn't cheesy or relies on special effects to make its money.

He gave me a copy to watch and it sat at my place for a long time. Anyone, I finally got around to watching it, and I was BLOWN AWAY! This was a fantastic movie, unlike anything else I've seen before.Everything about it is non-typical. The dialog is realistic, witty, and to the point. The jokes actually have you laughing instead of rolling your eyes. The movie wasn't about showing off lame special effects, it was about the story and the characters. It was a believable universe populated by real characters. The one thing I really love is the fact that they kill people when they should. Don't you hate when they let some bad guy live for no reason, like because they're the main characters and they're ""good"" they can't do stuff like that? I was so impressed with this movie, I hopped online to read as much as I could about it. I came here and read about the show Firefly. I had no idea that this was previously a TV series! You can guess what filled my queue from my online rental site after reading that. The show was even better than the movie. I couldn't believe I never even heard of the show before. I didn't know who Joss Whedon was since I was never a fan of Buffy or Angel. I find it a shame that a show like this wasn't given a real chance to get an audience.I encourage everyone to check the movie and the series out. You'll be hooked for sure!

The fact that this movie even got made after the series was canceled is impressive enough, but MY GOD Serenity is amazing. The characters, the dialog, all the daring places the movie ventures, everything was extraordinary. The movie is quick to inform those who weren't lucky enough to catch the series on TV or DVD about the characters and their past, and from there on in the movie is an all out blast with completely new and inspirational scenes, problems, and events. As not to ruin the movie for any ""Browncoats"" who haven't seen the movie, I won't divulge any secrets...except that some characters are lost, some story lines are ended (and some created), and some questions are finally answered (Who are those Reavers anyways?)

If you love ""proper"" science fiction (ie fiction based on science) then avoid this movie (and the associated TV series ""Firefly"") like the plague.

The casting is nauseatingly politically correct. The crew dynamics seem lifted from the Alien franchise. The lead character is a smuggler avoiding the laws of an evil empire... sound familiar? He's Han Solo with a badly done Southern drawl (that often disappears). There are so many clichés we've seen in other movies, it's almost unwatchable for an adult who values his time.

1115,loccy,"Good, verging on very good -- but 160th best film of all time?!",7,25 October 2005,"I am a sci-fi fan, but for some reason had never actually sat down and watched any of Whedon's stuff before Firefly. So, when I started watching Firefly, I did so with perhaps with perhaps a more critical mind than those who'd watched Buffy every week, and were already convinced as to Mr. Whedon's credentials.I stopped watching Firefly after about eight or nine episodes. The thing that jarred me out of the reality Firefly portrayed -- which did have some highly original and intriguing aspects -- was the whole Western aspect. Advocates of Firefly will tell you this is what makes the series so unique, so original. Me, I just couldn't buy it. I don't care how poor the frontier planets were -- in a society technologically advanced for interstellar travel, there's no way you'd end up aping the Old West in terms of behaviour models, sociological factors, whatever you want to call it. I'd watch an episode of Firefly, enjoy it, and then find myself disappointed the following week when it'd be back to Little Warp Drive on the Prairie. It got to the point where if, after ten minutes of an episode, it was apparent that they were in Western mode that week, I'd switch off -- and I stopped watching soon after. Which was a shame, because when Firefly was in sci-fi mode, I found myself getting drawn in.I suspect that I was something of a unique audience when watching Serenity. I had a passing familiarity with Firefly the series, but wasn't expecting very much from the movie. Having seen the film, it's clear Whedon had two target audiences -- Firefly fans, and Firefly virgins. People like me didn't come into it. Consequently, to find I thoroughly enjoyed it comes as a very pleasant surprise.Serenity doesn't so much move along as rampage along, taking few breaks along the way, mainly to reintroduce old characters from the series. The final 40 minutes or so is pure action, clearly done on a budget Whedon would never had had on a TV screen, and he clearly revels in it, as do his cast. A special mention for Chiwetel Ejiofor, who is absolutely outstanding as the nameless Alliance agent (although as a Brit I find myself shaking my head again at the American film industry's love for Englishmen as villains).Production values were clearly in advance of what Whedon had to work with on the series, and his world made its transition to the big screen extremely well. Contrast Star Trek: Generations, ST:TNG's first outing, where what you were seeing was clearly the TNG sets and props recycled.However, I do have to say that I think the rating for Serenity (8.4 out of 10 at the time of writing) is unfairly high. Better than Twelve Monkeys? Brazil? Rain Man? Being There? Better than Ghandi, for the love of God? It is obviously skewed by the Firefly fans out there who have voted in their droves, but would probably have voted highly for the film even if it'd have been Joss Whedon washing his socks for two hours. This doesn't make Serenity a bad film, far from it, but it does it no credit either, as it is impossible for an outsider to take any of the reviews seriously.Contrast The Chronicles of Riddick which deserves a far better rating than it has on IMDb. Too many people can't get beyond the fact that it a) stars Vin Diesel and b) is a sequel to the fun-enough but ultimately unambitious Pitch Black. However, Riddick and Firefly have many similarities. Both writer/directors have extremely ambitious sci-fi universes for their characters to play in, quite unlike other more pedestrian sci-fi worlds. Both writer/directors' characters have significant depth -- none of them are easily pigeon-holed. Mal, while not quite the anti-hero Twohy has in Riddick, isn't exactly the typical Lucas-type whiter-than-white hero. However, Riddick barely gets above a 6 because of the Diesel inverse snobbery factor, and also because David Twohy doesn't have the fan-base of Joss Whedon.Back to Serenity, then. For me, it gets a 7 out of 10. It was better than average fare, I'll be there for the DVD release, I'll be there for any sequels, and I might even take another look at Firefly the series and see if I can suspend my disbelief long enough to get beyond the Blazing Saddles moments. And, at the end of the day, I would imagine that Joss Whedon would be quite happy with that response to his film, coming from one who turned off his TV show.",Serenity
1116,adela_rm,Serenity should have its own Sci Fi section!,10,25 February 2007,"I have seen Serenity over 20 times, and yet I still find new things every time I watch it. I have over 400 DVDs half of which are Sci Fi, and by far this is the best. I saw the whole Firefly season set and then Serenity, it was better this way than Serenity 1st then Firefly, but the director did well, for the new fans to understand their logic, they didn't have to do much to know 'WHO' and what their occupation were! Serenity is a peaceful yet exciting piece of art, you do not need to use your brain much, & it is interesting how this last instalment ends with River telling a secret so strong to her heart, that she will kill to get it out of her head! The Art lies with River's grace, Mal's bravery and Jayne's stupidity that makes this film not be missed. Its light-hearted comedy within a serious Sci Fi film about right and wrong! My score if fair, as it has touched my heart, beyond any recognition, here lies a film that would make you laugh, cry, jump with fright, heart warming romance and SEX! (No nudity or actual sex but man - Nathan Fillion is SEXY!)",Serenity
1117,brianberns,Disappointing,6,9 October 2005,"I'm a fan of the original Firefly series, and had high hopes for Serenity based on the reviews. Sadly, it was not nearly as good as I expected.What rubbed me the wrong way? * Waaaaay too much emphasis on combat, starting with the opening scene. The fun of Firefly was always in the decisiveness and determination of Mal and crew in the face of a hostile universe. The movie reduced that spirit to a series of action movie clichés -- the worst of which being the revelation that River is not just a troubled psychic, but is also Jr. Kickboxing Champion of the galaxy. By the time the ""climactic"" battles rolled around, I was thoroughly bored with the fighting. River single-handedly slaughtering a horde of Reavers was just silly. Mal against the assassin was marginally better, but still clichéd and unbelievable.* Actions were too hyped-up and extreme. I understand that the characters have to be punched up a bit to make the leap from TV to a movie, but it was taken too far. Mal threatening to kill his crew if they don't help him travel through Reaver territory? River kicking her brother in throat because she thought he might ""deactivate"" her? Please. And Wash's death was just ridiculous (and unnecessary). Even the special effects were overdone -- they would have been better off just burning half the FX budget for this film in a big bonfire.* Plot holes galore. It's easy to overlook plot holes if a movie is good enough, but in this case the holes threatened to unravel the whole ball of yarn. The Alliance knows that Mal will seek shelter with Book or at other safe-havens, so they wipe them all out... but they don't stick around to greet Serenity when it arrives! How stupid is that? No, really. The Reavers all live in a small clump of ships in the middle of nowhere, but Mal can't detour Serenity a few kilometers around them in order to get from A to B? Space is a big place, folks, but the makers of this movie don't want you to think about that.* Half the plot elements that weren't full of holes were just incomprehensible. Can anyone tell me what exactly killed Wash? It seems to be the remains of a Reaver ship, but there's no way to tell. Or is it an Alliance ship? I had trouble caring. When Mal brings the entire Reaver fleet to Mr. Universe's planet, is he doing it on purpose? Did he expect to find the Alliance waiting for him? The answer to such key questions seems to both yes and no. Much of the movie was in such a frenetic hurry to move forward that it couldn't be bothered to make sense.* Simplistic. After the failure of Firefly, the movie was obviously dumbed-down for mass consumption. The revelations about River, the Reavers, Miranda, etc. were all disappointingly straightforward. The interesting relationship between Kaylee and the Doctor was reduced to a series of sex jokes. The only character who held up well through the entire movie was Jayne (since he still works well in a straightforward shoot-em-up like this). The build-up of the secret of ""Miranda"" was matched in lameness only by the too-easy revelation of the same secret about 15 minutes later.I really wanted to like this movie, but I walked out feeling that I had watched something that was 1 part Firefly mixed with at least 2 parts conventional Hollywood movie.",Serenity
1118,DeadCorpse,Loved it,10,13 October 2005,"As a fan of Sci-fi, this movie is everything that so many movies these days aren't. Smart. Witty. Thrilling. And even depressing in a spot or two. Admittedly, I was a fan of the short lived Firefly series, so I may be a bit biased. The witty dialog, attempts at depicting various philosophical challenges, actual character development, and original story arcs are all there. Most of Hollywood has forgotten what these are and instead seem to opt for glitz, glamor, and whatever polls well with the 18-25 Male demographic.Joss Whedon has woven an extraordinary tale to tell us here. His hero's are fallible, his villains are not always what they seem, and the good guys don't always win. Just like in real life. If you attempt to remove that aspect, you limit the experience of the film.Don't miss this one.",Serenity
1119,chaim79,Better then star trek/wars!,10,2 November 2005,"I've been a longtime fan of StarTrek, watched each of them from TNG to Enterprise, I've watched all the StarWars films, I've read a good portion of the books from StarTrek and StarWars, and they can't compete with Serenity. (That's even considering the StarTrek TV shows, the StarTrek Movies couldn't compete with MST3K, though they try).Serenity is set in a very believable Solar System (All that goes on is in a single Star System which has many of it's planets terraformed into livable worlds) There is nothing here that uses 'future' physics other then artificial gravity on the ships. The ships are believable in how they move, and how long it takes to get from point 'A' to point 'B'.All the characters are not only 'real' but enjoyable. They each fit together and work together and have a lot of great humor between them. The 'Wild West' view of how they are may take some getting used to for many people, but I find it very real and it adds a lot of great color to the look and dialog of the show. You know that these guys are your average people you would meet on the sidewalk put into a spaceship together. There is no character there that is out of place or that is unlikable, they all have their strengths and weaknesses and they work together.This movie is more 'real' then many of the movies that are 'based on actual events', and they have some of the greatest humor you could imagine, mostly because it's humor between the Serenity crew and we are just witnessing it instead of humor that's only for the audience. It's got all the elements you could ever wish for in a movie, Action, Romance (of a sort), Dialog, Badguys, Goodguys (well, their all right...) Weird guys, and Explosions. And the In-Orbit battle at the end simply ROCKS! All in all I am desperately waiting for the DVD to come out, and which point I will be desperately waiting for the Special Edition Directors Cut DVD to come out (with all the commentary I could ever wish for). I will most likely get both simply because this is such a great movie!E of E P.S. If Joss Whedon reads this Please put the same effort into the commentaries and extras that was put into the LOTR trilogy! Trust me, as a proud owner of the Special Extended Collectors Edition of the trilogy I know people will pay for it (and yes, that is the edition with the little statues). EE",Serenity

1121,numsy1979,Serenity saves a dwindling genre.,10,5 October 2005,"Serenity is just a great movie!!! Science Fiction has truly been rescued by Serenity. Lately Star Wars and Star trek has left a void in my heart for my favorite genre. Serenity or I should say the Firefly universe, has put joy in my heart. There is still hope! I mean I love the new Battlestar Galactica, but it's almost depressing. Firefly (Serenity) made science fiction fun again, like the first Star Wars. The new Star Wars are too political and Star Trek lately has truly bored the hell out of me (too scientific). My plea to all science fiction fans is: Please check this movie out. You will love the crew, the ship, and the bad guys. And my pleas to the non fans of science fiction: Please check this movie out, it can stand against any other film.",Serenity

I recently became a fan of Firefly so I had to go see Serenity as well.I thought the story was great, the acting was top notch in my opinion and the cinematography and special effects were beautiful.I am saddened by the thought that we will not get a sequel, as Serenity has fallen from the top ten at the Box Office rather quickly, pulling in very small numbers now it would seem, and most theaters that still play it are only giving it 1 or 2 show times a day.All in all I would love to see the story continue, but since that seems somewhat unlikely now at least Serenity provided closure to us Firefly Fans, and for everyone else was just a good (great) scifi flick.",Serenity
1123,bice04,"Good movie, was a little slow at first, but keep watching!",7,18 June 2011,"The film Serenity was about a ship named serenity where a certain group of people are hired guns or outlaws. The alliance ship cohorts are meant to study other people's mind movement and how their brain works. The main character of the film is Summer Glau; she goes by the name of River in the film. River has a special gift of telepathy, a psychic and the other people on the ship of the (Alliance) do not understand why or how she has the capability. Her brother Simon, played by Sean Maher, finds her on the ship and helps her escape from the tormented testing. The people on the alliance ship will stop at nothing to find River, for fear of what she possibly knows about their secrets and what she could with that information. This film is science fiction, action based in the galaxy journeys.This film has many similarities to The Chronicles of Riddick and Resident Evil, which are among my favorites of the sci-fi films. Throughout this film there are many transitions. The movie fades in out of darkness to enhance the feeling of being on a spaceship or the director's view of the future of mankind. The lighting in this film sets the stage for the future being nothing like anyone would want to believe it would be. It shows more violence and corrupt behaviors than ever seen. The fact that River has a gift of foreseeing what is going to happen helps her to prevent certain things from happening. Not only is she a psychic, she has a violent tendency much like an assassin, herself when she feels a traumatic memory, even if the memory is not hers. She is like a machine a person can turn on and off when you need her for her special gifts. She was implanted with memories of another person for testing purposes while in the Alliance control. The people of Serenity find an unknown planet in the galaxy named Miranda. When they arrive there, they learn of a toxic chemical that had two very polar opposite reactions to the human race. One reaction was that the human simply gave up on life. They stopped caring, eating, and just living. They seemed to have lain down and just died. The other reaction was mutated into zombie-like creatures that killed any other civilization population that did not give up and die on their own. They wait for the alliance and overpower them to take control back of their galaxy.",Serenity
1124,BladeRunner1982,"Great plot, great acting and excellent cinematography",10,17 July 2006,"Science fiction movies are so easy to criticize because things don't fit well or science is wrong or acting is bad. However, there are a few that rise above the rest. Serenity is one of them.I loved the American Western idealogy portrayed in the film as well as a very good portrayal of a possible future. The characters were very funny. The actors did justice to their characters and it seemed almost as if the characters were custom made for these actors.Very few science fiction movies have any moral lessons and this one does. This movie will easily become a cult classic just like Pitch Black and Blade Runner. If you loved those movies, you will love this one.Overall a 10 out of 10 for a job well done.",Serenity

I recommend renting or buying the series and watching it first, it brings everything in to perspective.Looking forward to whatever Joss has coming up in the future.",Serenity
1126,just_us_,Phenomenal,10,1 October 2005,"Absolutely phenomenal. I loved Firefly and I couldn't imagine a greater representation of it on the big screen. I have long come to expect no less than wondrous results when Joss Whedon takes control, but this was more than I ever expected and I was expecting a whole lot.I left the theatre filled with the emotions of the movie, and though not all positive, (I was distraught) I couldn't wait to see it again... In fact saw it just 4 hours later.The humour, the action, the emotion, the acting, everything was just what you come to expect from Joss but bigger and better not to mention the wit and sheer ballsy-ness.This movie can be enjoyed by everyone, whether they watched the show or not(though I noticed the little nudges and winks people who had seen the original incarnation passed at key points, almost as though they know these characters personally and intimately).My only peeve with the entire movie (which be no means impacted the enjoyment I got from the film) was that, through the T.V. series, the ship, Serenity, became a character in itself, one I grew to love for her warmth, and who was as important as any of the other characters. I understand that the original set was destroyed and had to be rebuilt, but I found it was almost as if the 'actor' that played her decided not to come back so they replaced her with a fraternal twin, a much colder fraternal twin. I found certain things within the ship jarring, size and colour and little things like that, but I'm particular and I'm sure no one else really noticed, and again, I forgot all about it and was swept away by the story.I had no idea walking into the theatre what the premise was, beyond that it was about these characters I had grown to love, and that was the best way for me to go in, I'm not one for spoilers, so I won't write a synopsis here. Though I will say that the premise, though by no means unimportant, isn't the thing. This is one of those rare sci-fi's where it is actually character driven; these are real people in an extraordinary situation, not the other way around.That's all for my part....I swallowed a bug.",Serenity
1127,bh24,Exceeded all expectations--1 small spoiler at the end of post,9,3 February 2006,"I will start by saying that I have only seen 1 episode of Firefly and thought it was just OK. I am not a real a Sci-fi fan, but do enjoy good action/adventure movies no matter how they are set. I had heard that this movie was very good given it's rating and all the positive posts, so I decided to check it out for myself. I kind of expected it to be a knock-off or at least an attempt to be like Star Wars (space ship battles, governmental quarrels, people/creatures with amazing powers, and probably love sub-plots). But I thought, hey I like the Star Wars movies a lot so maybe this will be similar. Well, it did have all of those aspects but what I did not expect is that I would be drawn in so much. From the moment when we first meet the main characters, I could tell this movie was going to be very good. These were much like the Star Wars bounty hunters doing jobs to make a living, but here they weren't dealing with strange creatures, it was with real human beings! This movie proved to have plenty of action scenes that are done exceptionally well, great suspense, and great character development. As it went on I got more and more into this film until I was totally in sucked in. I was especially drawn into the River character. I could not stop wondering what was up with her and what she could potentially do in this movie. I am not sure if she was part of the Firefly series, but to me, was the reason this film was so great. The suspense of this movie was in waiting to see what she would do next, how she could change the outcome or the direction of the story. Spoiler here--The one thing I feel this movie missed on was not enough of the battle seen when she took on the Reebers(or whatever those maniacs are called) by herself in the end. I felt that the whole movie was building up to that one scene, and I was on the edge of my seat when it began to happen. But they only showed maybe 30-40 seconds of this while cutting to other fights. Still it was an amazing scene all together, but could have been, for me, one of the best endings ever if they focused a lot of time to her battle and made it more intense. This movie exceeded all my expectations of being something like Star Wars, and turned out to be an outstanding story of its own. It was action packed, funny and completely interesting in its plot as an adventure movie, regardless of it also being sci-fi.",Serenity
1128,deathbypopculture,A rational review.,4,3 October 2005,"A legion of obsessed fans have given this movie a high rating and a (hopefully brief) place on the top 200 list. The honest truth is that this movie was, at best, mediocre. Joss Whedon, who generally has a flare for clever dialogue and interesting characters, fell flat on his face with ""Serenity"".Perhaps part of the problem is that I was not a Firefly fan. Maybe for consistent viewers of the show the characters were well-rounded and deep. Unfortunately, for the non-Firefly viewers the characters were incredibly thin and boring. They were like ink sketches of people, with no depth and no real traits. The ships' captain is painted as a ""hard"" man (a very John Wayne a la The Cowboys or The Searchers type character) who only looks out for himself and those few he has chosen as crew. And just to drive this point home, he is called Mal, and we're all aware of what that means in Latin I'm sure. Mal is narcissism at it's worst. And his ""change"" from self-centered, looking out for number one guy to righteous sword of justice and freedom is completely implausible.The other characters, all with cute names like Zoe, Kaylie, River and, my favorite ham-handed choice, strong guy Jane are just as thin and cartoony as Mal. It's hard to care about any of them because they're such generic ""shoot 'em up"" characters.Obviously the pairing of westerns and science fiction has a long tradition. Star Wars, Heinlein, hell, even the Last Starfighter... Whedon though takes it to an extreme here. It comes off as silly, overwrought and even garish. Characters say ridiculous things which are meant to have a ""cowboy"" feel. These lines seemed forced and far too obvious. They bog down and stilt an already weak and muddled script. There is also a pervasive ""mystic"" feel that's hackneyed and overused in this type of film.Perhaps the best overall description is that this film is simply rather juvenile. It's something for teenagers and those with less demanding taste. It seems half-baked. A decent idea never brought to fruition.Basically, if you're a giant sci-fi fan wait for video, it's worth a rental for a few decent space scenes. If you're not a sci-fi junkie, don't bother. Or better yet, rent the Farscape series, especially the two part mini-series, The Peacekeeper Wars. It's vastly superior to Serenity.",Serenity
1129,jlleonar,Not just for Sci-fi fans (tell your friends about this movie),10,5 January 2006,"Unlike the other comments I've read so far, I did not hear of or see the TV show before I watched this movie. This made no difference to me. I was truly blown away by this film. From the opening to the ending, the action is constant, the acting is actually pretty good and the story is one of the best you'll encounter in Hollywood. I hate to be cliché, but probably the best story since The Matrix (same type of action as well). The realism, despite being in space, is quite magnificent as well. At the end of the movie, when the characters are in dire straights, you absolutely do not know what will happen next. I don't know about anyone else, but that's what I watch movies for.The characters are believable and real with real motivations and feelings; something that is missing from many high effects movies of today. Even though there are a lot of fantastic visuals in the movie, much of the action is honed to perfection on a small scale. People fighting people (or 'reevers,' yet another fascinating creation of this movie) is a welcome sight in a world full of effects based creatures fighting other effects based creatures or features. The bare-boned action will make you pump your fist and move in your seat. The visuals will awe and astound.I did not see this movie in the theatre and I am extremely saddened by that fact. TELL YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT THIS MOVIE! It deserves more acclaim and notoriety than it has received, maybe a re-release in the theatres? maybe a sequel or two?",Serenity
1130,nhwatts,Excellent Movie!!,10,3 October 2005,"I saw ""Serenity"" on the day it opened. I completely enjoyed this film. The opening 15 minutes was such a creative way to explain and present the required back-story to this film. The special effects fit the story perfectly. No substitution of special effects for lack of story direction. The dialog of all the characters was very witty and clever. Isn't it sort of tiring to have just the one character making jokes in a film?Go see this movie you will get your money's worth and a little more. This movie experience is like a fine roller coaster ride--it was up, down and even a little sideways but by the end you loved it all. It is without a doubt the best film I have seen this year.

1131,benchavda,The Best Original SciFi Film since The Matrix,10,9 October 2005,"Coming from someone who wasn't a fan of the show, I hope this carries the weight it should. Serenity really is the best Original Sci-Fi film since the Matrix. What do I mean? Serenity had its own world, its own rules. It created a universe for you to escape into and explore. What's more, it did it with wonderful characters and a fun script. To top it all, Serenity accomplished this costing 1/3 of any of the new Star Wars films. This is a simple film, not the most advanced special effects nor the most originally choreographed fight scenes. In some ways, it is just as much Indiana Jones as it is Star Wars. If you took a bunch of cowboys, made them intergalactic truckers and forced them to fight an Evil Empire, you would have Serenity. When one of the modern masters of Sci Fi, Orson Scott Card, states that if his masterpiece Ender's Game can't be as good a movie as Serenity he doesn't want it made, then by all means you should take notice. This is not a film that will change your life. This is a film that will take you away from the troubles of this world for two hours, and it will do it better than perhaps any other film this year. Nathan Fillion as Mal Reynolds is the Real Deal; he's a Han Solo for the new millennium, cocky, brash, angry, soulful. Summer Glau as River Tam is a moving portrait of a small, damaged person who has an incredible destiny. And Adam Baldwin as Jayne Cobb is one of the best ""heavies"" to hit the screen. Ever. This film just works. It's a shame that this film has not received the audience it deserves. If you're reading this and haven't seen the film, do yourself a favor. Spend the money for a ticket or a rental. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.",Serenity
1132,kaliannameyron,Wow. Just wow.,10,2 October 2005,"Let me begin by saying that I was not a fan of Firefly prior to seeing this film. I had largely overlooked it. In the last twenty-four hours, I have finally had to admit that Joss Whedon, whose work I have never before enjoyed, has created something utterly beautiful. I could gush about this films for hours, days, months, and I wouldn't be able to cover everything that I loved about it. Serenity operates on several levels. For the fans of the show -- and I finally understand what it is that you've been going on about all this time -- it is something of a homecoming. It easily feels as epic as any film twice its length. You can turn your brain off and watch it for the sheer entertainment of it, but if you decide to go digging deeper and looking into things that I'm often told I shouldn't, you may find this one of the most meaningful films made in the past decade. So many films are effective only in moments and instances, and while the quotes page will show you that this movie has plenty of fantastic moments, the entire film flows smoothly. This movie has everything I look for in movies. It's highly quotable, simple enough not to give me a headache, deep and complex enough not to lower my IQ, fine writing, above- average acting, and wrapped up in a very, very pretty batch of special effects. It could be a date movie, but you could easily watch it with your mom, or every one of your old friends from high school. Now, this is not a perfect film. It is not as well-written as some other films, but it's certainly not the worst script I've ever seen. In fact, it's one of the best scripts I've seen for a science fiction film in... ever. The acting may or may not be ""Oscar Worthy"" (whatever that means...) but it is very good. Summer Glau and Nathan Fillion are especially amazing, but that is not to say that the rest of the cast isn't stunning as well. Gina Torres and Alan Tudyk continue to amaze me, and Adam Baldwin gives what I feel is his best performance since Full Metal Jacket. The characters each have their own endearing qualities. Some have perhaps too many of their endearing characteristics, but that only serves to make them that much more real.The one thing about this movie that sticks out most in my mind is one scene that I sadly cannot go into detail about. All I will say, is there are a few moments with River that are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. I am thrilled that this film came out when it did: just when I could afford to go out to the movies. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a once-overlooked series to watch now.",Serenity
1133,Shylo,A New Breed of Sci-Fi,10,3 October 2005,"Like every other fan of Joss Whedon's ill-fated sci-fi series ""Firefly"", I have been waiting for the opening of his silver-screen adaptation, ""Serenity"", with bated breath. I was not disappointed. ""Serenity"" hits all the same high points as ""Firefly""--a solid plot structure, endearing characters, witty dialog containing Chinese expletives and plot twists to shock even the most cynical and seasoned movie-goer--without leaving people who aren't ""browncoats"" (the name given to die-hard Firefly fans) in the dark.""Serenity"" has all the makings of a tent-pole sci-fi movie--killer CG effects, explosions, new-fangled technology and spaceship battles--but it also contains the kind of psychological concepts not usually found in sci-fi movies. The movie's main villain, known only as the Operative, is so passionate and calculated about his actions that you can't help but see the logic in his motives, which is a refreshing change from the black-and-white distinction between good and evil found in, say, ""Star Wars"", which is the main shortcoming of most sci-fi films. The female characters all defy the standard damsel-in-distress stereotype, and the nine passengers on board the ship Serenity will win you over before you've even gotten their names straight. Combine all of that with the snappy one-liners, which will keep you laughing for hours on end, and there's no doubt that ""Serenity"" re-defines the entire sci-fi genre.This is one film you don't want to miss.",Serenity

THAT is a gargantuan task.Yet, there's no better man for the job than Joss Whedon, and I gave him every ounce of faith and trust I had, and he did not disappoint. I really believe he achieved the closest thing as possible to perfection under those challenging circumstances. He did the impossible... and I don't have to tell you the rest.My knuckles are still white, my eyes still stinging, my throat still hoarse from laughter.

Most good films have one or two lines that you know will become classics. This one seemed to have them every time someone opened their mouth. From ""I aim to misbehave."" to ""I swallowed a bug."", to ""I am a leaf on the wind, watch how I soar!"" It was like he took the entire television series, condensed it into a little ball and shot it up with adrenaline and steroids. Speaking of the series, I was concerned that people unfamiliar with Firefly would have trouble getting up to speed, or worse yet, that Whedon would have to waste a lot of time with clunky exposition. I needn't have worried. Although I still recommend buying the series DVD's, Joss did a wonderful job. There isn't a moment wasted, this is a lean and jam-packed piece of work. I'm already wondering where we'll be taken in future outings and happily looking forward to a franchise!",Serenity
1136,Anomalous,Watch the Series First,8,28 August 2006,"A fan of the original series, I was treated to Firefly before it even released on television (working for a Fox affiliate had its benefits) so I was quite eager to see the show do well on television. Well. That didn't go so well, and I have more than a few hard feelings for Fox for canning the show without giving it its due chance.But that's the way life goes. When I learned of the Firefly movie to wrap up the series, I was even more eager to see it. Well. I'll spare you the details but this movie is not nearly enough of the conclusion I was looking for. The movie answers maybe two questions I had and prompted even more.So I wait patiently for another movie, if there ever will be one. Is this movie even slightly entertaining for someone not familiar with the series? I can't imagine anyone finding it fun. Someone not familiar with the series would see it as just another sci-fi with little attachment to the characters. I give it an eight because, despite its weaknesses (and Joss Whedon's sadistic love of killing off good guys) I still enjoyed it. Knew I nothing of the series, I might give it a five. Maybe even less.",Serenity
1137,ZephyrHawk,Definitely worth seeing,9,3 October 2005,"As a longtime Firefly fan, my biggest worry for this movie was not whether or not I would enjoy it ( I was fairly certain I would), but whether or not people who were not fans of the TV series would like it. After seeing it, I no longer have that concern. It was not incomprehensible to the Firefly virgin and, in fact, was a very good movie all around. I have no problem recommending it to fans and non-fans alike. The dialogue was excellent (as if we would expect differently from Joss). My only problem was that, if you saw all the Sci-fi channel previews and trailers, you already heard most of the best lines. The effects were good. Not amazing, but not overdone like the Star Wars prequels. The plot, while not the most original, was better than what you see in 90% of space related sci-fi movies; which, really, is what this should be compared to. Anyone who went into the show looking for drop dead acting and Oscar bait plot was fooling themselves. It was an exciting romp and I would definitely see it again.Except that I will never see it again.Ever.Nor the episodes on DVD that I once received 3 copies of for Christmas. Nor any sequels. Nothing. Why? Because this movie broke my heart. Charistmatic-breaking-down-in-the-stretch-of-the-1999-Belmont-stakes broke it. Crushed. Betrayed.Do I understand why a certain action had to take place? Yes, I do. For fans, at least, it aided the script. It showed us exactly what was at stake. For those who do not know and love the cast, it may have been a mere side note. Only in comedies does everyone survive. If you're trying to make a serious drama (and that is gorram hard to do with a ""space western""), then somebody, someone well liked, is going to have to bite it. From the position of a writer I understand, and from the position of a movie lover, I feel it did, ultimately, make it a better movie.For the nine year old kid dressed in a Hawaiian shirt my friend saw bawling in the restroom after the movie, however, it was more than a movie.Browncoats rejoice. Joss made a good movie. And lost a few die-hard fans in the process.",Serenity
1138,pbilly36,Amazing,7,21 September 2005,"I never post on here - I never felt strongly enough to do it - but I have to admit, as a fan, this movie was awesome.The money spent, the investment in the series by the fans, the cast, Joss etc... is all on the screen.The plot is interesting and expands on the ideals of series, and will not alienate the uninitiated or the Browncoats out there - the effects, score and performances are excellent, and the shocks and excitement - blimey, it's a 2 hour emotional roller-coaster..It deserves a sequel and a franchise to rival the other infamous trilogies out there!",Serenity
1139,hazyone101,Serenity Rocks!,10,10 October 2005,"I watched Firefly on TV and was worried about how they would bring it to the bring screen.I had fears that they would spend too much time trying to explain the back story to new people who hadn't seen the show or would try and start out fresh and change too many things.I was pleasantly surprised to find that they explained the back story very simply within the first couple of minutes and everyone was right up to speed and we went on from where the show left off.People who watched the show and people seeing it with fresh eyes loved it equally.The movie was well written, well acted, had a plot and didn't take the typical Hollywood way out by playing it safe.I love the fact that Joss Whedon's idea of the future doesn't include silly looking aliens or fancy gadgets that do all the work for you.I left the theater feeling like I had just stepped off the most daring ride in the theme park. When my knees stopped shaking, I went back and did it again, 4 more times!",Serenity

I know Gina Torres from ""Alias,"" but the rest of this wonderful cast is new and fascinating to me. Why, for example, isn't Nathan Fillion a huge star? Ditto Summer Glau? Or Jewel Staite? I wanted to call all my friends immediately to recommend this pic, if only anyone I knew cared about such sublime sci-fi art. The dialogue is ridiculously good. The flow of the plot and the character development, not to mention the photography, is up to Star Trek standards. Thanks Joss Whedon and gang, whoever you are! P.S.

Borg?... it's a bit of a stretch, but not really... 3-the barricade scene... Aliens?4-Mr. Universe and the planet where the cantina-like place is reminds me of Blade Runner5-i could go on...the comparisons to previous Sci-Fi movies are many, but it's OK for TV... it should have survived as a TV show, because it works for TV... it's not a big-screen thing... it pays homage to the big screen things... neither is Buffy or Angel, but i love them to death!i'd say there is a young audience starving for a new generation of Sci-Fi... everything old isn't always new again...",Serenity

This is the genius of Joss Whedon, and he usually accomplishes all of this magic, along with at least one or two totally quotable lines, in the space of just an hour long television show. Serenity was wonderful, and it was great to see what the master can do with a longer time format and more room to play with special effects. My advice is not to bring young children to this movie, because the imagery and the emotion are definitely vivid. Unless you want to explain a LOT or deal with scary bad dreams for a few weeks...get a sitter! Enjoyed it greatly and can't wait for the next one.",Serenity
1143,chris-collins19,"See it, bring your friends, your family, your neighbors, everybody. (No Spoilers)",10,23 August 2005,"I was fortunate enough to see both screenings in DC...walked out of the first one dazed and stunned, simply astounded. Walked out of the second one even more amazed, but better grounded. This movie, like Joss Whedon's TV work, merits repeated viewings...there is so much going on, so many characters at work and play, somehow seamlessly interwoven into a perfect tapestry.Violence: as noted in some posts above, yes, indeed. But it all has context--there's nothing gratuitous about any of it. And, for fans of the show or DVD set, a question or two left from the series is answered.Humor: Still intact, and maybe even more so. A hallmark of Whedon's TV shows is his ability to inject humor into even the most dramatic of scenes, and this movie will showcase that to a large audience.Acting: Fabulous, right down to tiny supporting characters. The cast of nine from the show are all there, and in superb form. The villain of the piece should become legendary.Effects: I don't care for FX all that much, especially when it's patently obvious that they are computer generated. I don't get that feeling with Serenity. It looks and feels real.In short: brilliant. I will be dragooning people to the theater the opening weekend (last time I did that was with Kenneth Branagh's Henry V, so my enthusiasm here is not just some fanboy kind of thing, honest!) I cannot say it strongly enough: Go and see this movie!",Serenity
1144,byrodude,Sci Fi Needs This.,10,1 October 2005,"Fantastic science fiction. The Idea of a big empirical force trying to ""create utopia"" is one that i don't think has been touched on enough, rather than Aeon Flux and possibly Logan's Run. But that's the plot. How was it as Firefly?Amazing, exciting, shocking, frightening. Everything I wanted it to be, and more.This movie is superior to all of the star wars movies released since after return of the jedi. Probably one of the best sci fi movies i've ever seen, if just one of the most exciting and entertaining ones.Let's hear Firefly, Series 2!",Serenity
1145,mikepayneuk,Wow Wow Wow!!!,10,15 October 2005,"Wow! Is the word that pretty much explains my view on Serenity. It maybe succinct but i can't find a darn fault with anything in this film and wow sums it up so well. For 119 minutes my attention was glued to the screen, mesmerized completely by what i was watching. I have only recently converted to the brown coat ways but gosh what a great decision. I started watching the first episode of firefly last week and 2 minutes in i was totally hooked. Slow burning maybe, but so funny and the really smart dialogue left me wanting to know more about these people so when i reached the last episode i knew i had to see Serenity. It had been on my mind to see it after all the buzz i had heard but i wasn't prepared for how impressed, astonished, surprised i would be at the magnificence of it all. And what surprises there were with the deaths of major characters from the firefly crew. Characters i had grown to love but were ripped away with hardly any remorse provoked a reaction in me that overall i could believe. As Shepard Book would say 'i don't care what you believe just believe it' and these decisions, tough as I'm sure they were, are totally vindicated. After all it's a tough world they live in and they couldn't all survive, i was thankful for this realistic approach. Mal Reynolds is a fantastic creation (as are all the characters really) and his darker nature is in keeping with the bad stuff thats been happening between firefly and Serenity. You can really feel his frustration without Inara and the way everything hasn't really worked out for him. It's sad to watch but Nathan Fillian's portrayal of the character is fantastic. My favourite moment, if i could pick one, would be the scene where serenity fly's out of the clouds to be faced by the alliance fleet but with such a kick in the tail that the reaction of the operative really does sum it up wonderfully. Joss Whedon has done a great job of balancing the needs of the fans with the needs of the unconverted whilst moving the series onto the big screen. When i think of Serenity i find myself loving every thought i have about it with a huge smile on my face. I can only hope and pray that these great characters get another film to expand into.",Serenity
1146,Losturtle,A review from someone unfamiliar with Firefly.,10,30 September 2005,"I've heard the hype of the film, people said it would reinvigorate a dead series, that it would bring life back to the sci-fi genre, some even went as far to say that it would give the blockbuster a much needed quality-revival. It is very rare that the hype lives up to it's bill, especially in the case that the film is based on a cult series. Serenity is one of those rare films.Being completely in the dark about the Firefly universe, i worried about what anyone would; that you'd need to be familiar with the series to enjoy the film. I thought ""maybe we'll just have a voice-over to bring people up to speed"". Whedon made quick work of this thought by bringing a well realised introduction to the story, the characters, the world and the history by linking them all together cohesively and simultaneously showing off Nathan Fillion's acting talent. (Fillion is the centre of an approx. 6 minute take where he walks the ship and interacts/sets up the character's of his crew members) With a $40 - $50 million budget i wasn't quite sure what to expect in this department since a sci-fi blockbuster usually or could cost as much as three times that figure but again i was pleasantly surprised that this limitation was well used and perhaps the limit was very much for the better. For too long have intelligent audiences sat in a movie for two hours and forced to watch one and three quarters worth of cgi, thankfully there is finally some dialog and real, well realised characters that have sorely been missing in not just sci-fi, but blockbusters in general.One thing that will stand out to anyone watching is how vivid and deep the characters are. The film's main character, ""Mal"" Reynolds is a tortured soul who believes he has a burden of responsibility over his crew which, in the recesses of his mind, have now become his only family. He has lost much in his past including Serenity Valley in a great battle of the same name and his entire platoon bar the strong-willed Zoe. Mal has taken to the ""sky"" in a bid to find freedom and a release for his pain but finds a family and comes to accept the responsibility he wanted to escape once more, this time though, not out of necessity (although he was a volunteer for the war) but out of love.I have never really been a fan of Whedon, i thought Buffy lost it's spark halfway through its run and Angel didn't interest me at all. But of course Whedon's staple has been his ""witty"" dialog. Some people love it, some hate it, usually i'm the latter but it works incredibly well in Serenity and is never overused for a cheap laugh. Quite often the jokes would even serve to explore a character in a little more detail than would be possible if the film had a totally serious edge. The wit isn't just to pleads crowds, it amazingly serves the story. Even people who don't like Whedon's brand of wit, shouldn't worry since it's not that momentous that it becomes absolutely integral to the story.Overall this is a vivid, and imaginative (yes i know all space adventures use westerns as influence but none use it as a real and visual element in the story, besides maybe Cowboy Bebop), journey through a fully realised universe with real and interesting characters with even a little social commentary thrown in, although telling you how would spoil the story. The tag-line for Serenity is ""You can't stop the signal."" Damn straight, i was pleasantly surprised to find that the film adaptation of a failed sci-fi TV series that i hadn't even seen was one of the best films of the year and that is no exaggeration. We never thought top-notch special effects and intelligent stories would ever be seen in the same film before, thankfully we've finally been proved wrong.""I aim to misbehave.""",Serenity
1147,vchengap,Highly overrated,2,10 October 2005,"I'm a fan of sci-fi movies (some movies I like: Contact, Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, and Matrix), and I was excited to see this movie after seeing the ratings it received on Rottentomatoes.com and IMDb. But after sitting through this movie, I gotta say it was a bad idea to bring it to the big screen. I was either rolling my eyes or falling asleep in the theater. You know how those really bad movie trailers make you cringe in your seat sometimes? And you know the movies going to suck? I had that feeling for the duration of the movie. I thought I was watching a horribly-produced Sci-Fi Channel movie. Reavers? C'mon now. Maybe this movie should have been titled, ""Attack of the Cannibal Space-Zombies."" If you want to watch a corny-but-entertaining sci-fi flick, go rent Starship Troopers.",Serenity

They act in a way you can understand.4) The dialogues are as usual, witty, gritty and refreshingly free of platitudes and false heroics.

1149,winnabay,Am I the only one disappointed in this movie??????,6,26 October 2005,"I went into this movie with SUCH high expectations I am the hugist Buffy fan and loved Firefly. Half way through the film I felt like crying, everything I respected so much about Joss's series seemed to be missing. There was lots of cool spacey action scenes, great if you are into that. However there was hardly any development of the characters, their stories and the dialogue I only found half funny. All the mystery and suspense carefully built up in the series was abandoned. Instead characters became expendable at the expense of obvious plot movement. It reminded me of American attempts to spell out the ABC of Japanese horror stories: a failure.",Serenity
1150,TravisGood,True to TV's Firefly but scaled to a movie's epic proportions.,9,5 October 2005,"I heard such good word-of-mouth compliments about the TV show that for the first time in my life I ordered the DVD set without having seen a single episode. Watched in the correct order (a now-famous Fox TV faux pas with the airing of Firefly) the series is excellent, though it ended inconclusively. Serenity the movie does a magnificent job of bringing many open-ends to closure, but it also does a surprisingly good job of presenting a self-contained fabulous story. The movie was an excellent adventure; the team did a great job with their $45MM of funding from Universal, small budget for a major release.Is this the first of a trilogy? One can only hope and pray! This movie is HIGHLY recommended.",Serenity
1151,donnechick,Best movie I've seen this year,10,1 October 2005,"Not having been a watcher of this series, I was not sure what to expect when I went with my daughter and her friend to see this movie. I was, however, familiar with Joss Whedon and was a big fan of his work on Buffy and Angel, two of the smartest series ever made. I also knew he had had to lobby to get this movie done after the premature cancellation of the series. I was pleasantly surprised -- No, take that back --blown away by this movie. I did not have to be familiar with the characters or the storyline to catch on to the action. The story has what I like about good SF movies -- good special effects, a believable storyline, comedy, violence, and a few tear-jerking moments. Plenty of surprises, too, to keep it from being predictable. Honestly, this is the best movie I've seen this year. My hat's off to Joss Whedon's tenacity in getting this one made.",Serenity

Having watched the DVD several times, I still get a kick out of the movie.I do hope Whedon and Company makes a follow up movie. Serenity wasn't laden with gadgets and ponderous dialog. It reminds me of what a ships captain on the high seas might encounter as he goes about staying alive and not tossed in jail while earning enough money to keep his crew from mutiny.Blood loss at a minimum and good old fashion Saturday movie fare. I saw how they did the chase scene with the ground shuttle, for lack of better words and it made it more realistic.Clyde L Harris",Serenity
1153,emtaylor23,It's just not the same...,6,5 April 2012,"I watched the TV series in the space of a few days and I thought it was amazing! I cannot comprehend the stupidity of the person who decided to cancel the show. I finished watching the last episode and went straight into watching the movie, I just wanted more. The movie is a lot more 'sci-fi' than the series, which isn't really a bad thing. The characters are also a lot thinner and less interesting, as is the plot. Too much focus on the Reavers and not the right focus on River. This story was definitely not what they were heading for in the series, I mean an assassin set out to kill River..? Many times they state that they want her ALIVE and not because she may know some 'big secret'. In the series the crew could never be considered 'rebels' and it was never really about fighting the Alliance but just about finding a living which is what made it unique. Also the whole 'western in space' idea is pretty much gone in this. The charm of the series and the characters is gone, it's less intelligent and less interesting. Although it is a sci- fi, it is also less believable with plenty of plot holes. I wanted to see the mysteries surrounding River to be revealed with explanations that were shocking and actually made sense, for the Preacher's (Book) very mysterious past to be revealed but he was more of a cameo and lastly for Anara and Mal's relationship to develop a fair bit but she was also practically a cameo. So if this is what you are looking for as a fan, you will not find it. To Newcomers this would probably only be an average film, easily forgotten, maybe a little boring but possibly worth watching. I am however disappointed.",Serenity
1154,sidious_of_the_sith,It is a good movie!,8,12 November 2005,"I went to see this movie simply because the trailer on TV looked intriguing! I had never seen the Fox TV show ""Firefly"" or really even heard of it. (payed attention actually) Television is so flooded with mindless crap, that I think I overlooked ""Firefly"" because of the poor way Fox promoted it.However, I am a big Fan of movies with kick-butt women(Electra, Fifth Element, Resident evil, Blade Trinity) and when I saw the Trailer for Serenity, I saw it just how they promoted it, as an action movie...I saw it as a possible Fifth Element type, eye candy movie..And I was not at all disappointed. My Wife asked me numerous times, ""well, why do you want to see it? What is it about?"" I didn't know! But we went and saw it and both liked it. I walked out of the theater kind of confused..I mean, zombies, old west, space ships, Kung-Fu chicks...What the heck was that???? but I liked it! Then after a bit a research I realized..OH this was a TV show! And my wife and I have been watching the DVDs of the series ""Firefly"" since we saw the movie. I like the show VERY MUCH..and agree with what everyone has said, positive, about the show. Now looking back on the movie from the reverse perspective then most of the people that have written reviews on here, I like the movie even more! Why not make River kick some ass???? I mean gee, she was just kind of a nut in the TV show, they didn't have time to really give her the background she needed. I could see that really happening on the TV show if it had continued. (track record of shows like Buffy and Angel which have a lot of action, especially with female roles) The movie did just what they wanted, it got fans of the show satisfied, to one extent or another, and it brought MORE fans to the firefly universe! I highly recommend this flick to anyone, even..and maybe more so, to non-Firefly fans, you will probably become one.",Serenity

Never watched the series but fell in love with the characters right away. This film proves, that there is nothing as important as well-written, ""round"" characters for this kind of movie. I hope that other directors will take up this western-SF-hybrid theme again. There have been many attempts and Cowboy Bebop and Serenity demonstrate that it can be done in a very entertaining way, but I am still longing for a show that lives a little longer so that the story can really go beneath the surface...

1157,hopeful_fiction,The audience speaks loud and clear - SEE SERENITY!,10,1 October 2005,"Serenity is amazing, full of humour, heart, brilliant writing and directing, awe-inspiring action and effects. People who are interested in films enough to visit a site like IMDb will NOT be disappointed by Serenity. Much of the promo surrounding Serenity addresses the fact that its roots are in a cancelled Joss Whedon television program, but this should be far from discouraging for those unfamiliar with Firefly, and unsure as to whether it's worth seeing Serenity.Far from being an unsuccessful television show, Whedon's Firefly gained practically instant cult status among television viewers. Unfortunately, due to a not-so-comedic series of errors where the show wasn't effectively advertised or even regularly screened by the network, it was doomed from the beginning. Without a doubt, if Firefly had been aired on the same, smaller network as say, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, it would not have been axed. As it was, when the news came that the network in question was dropping Firefly, the response from the viewers was such that a new cultural term had to be coined to describe it - guerilla fans. Firefly was good enough to incite in its viewers strong feelings enough to wage extreme campaigns aimed at the network planning to axe Firefly, campaigns that involved mass postcard mailings to the network, petitions, full-page advertising being taken out. Thousands of dollars were raised for charity via events run by and for fans of Firefly. The support was such that, even though the network still dropped the show, sales of the complete series Firefly DVD broke into the top 10 bestseller list on amazon.com (it's possibly also worth noting here that a huge amount of Firefly dvds sold on amazon were second- or third-purchases of the set by the same people, still enthusiastic enough about the quality of the show that they would spend $60 on a DVD to give away to someone who hadn't seen it. In the week leading up to Serenity's release the Firefly set has reached #7 again). This is how Serenity got made. It was an uphill fight all the way, and not only by the people behind the original series and the film - but by the people who enjoyed the Firefly universe to the extent that they felt compelled to fight this hard. A film that came about due to this much work from this many passionate people ought to be testimony enough - go and see it, if only to see what all the fuss is for, let alone the incredible film-making.",Serenity
1158,RobinGCAvon,Most excellent movie,10,4 October 2005,"This is just another voice praising Joss Whedon & his movie ""Serenity"". It's been a long time since I was this overwhelmed in a movie. It's almost like a fantastic theme park ride. It starts you off slow-kinda, and then 'whoosh', the action takes you on the ride of your life. Up & down, over & around, in & out you go, leveling out for a moment before you plummet back into the action & special effects of the movie. The stars are so completely in-tune with their characters. No wishy-washy stick people these... Everyone of them genuinely having the time of their life. None were going through the motions. I encourage any who really want honest entertainment to see ""Serenity"". You will never be disappointed.",Serenity

Highly anticipated Serenity delivers on all counts, bringing Joss Whedons vision of the future to the big screen in the best possible way. Delivering the same fantastic dialogue Whedon shows are known for, Serenity is a fantastic piece of genre writing and shows the world what Joss Whedon can do with a feature film.The unique thing about Serenity is the complex let seemingly familiar world it depicts, the characters arn't the morally superior heroes weir used to in sci fi, serving a greater purpose like star treks federation. Instead weir shown people with flaws who are trying to survive in a universe that thats far from idyllic.If you've seen the series, serenity comes from then youl know what to expect from this amazing piece of cinema, if you haven't youl be taken on a journey from the moment the film opens and you wont want it to end.The truly great thing about this movie, that i perhaps no other has done as well, is its amazing transition from the series to the big screen.

1160,magpie_dreamer,Big Damn Movie!,10,8 October 2005,"I'll say this: There are only four movies in the world that have ever made me cry; Bambi, Paradise Road, The Lost Prince and Serenity.This is a good movie.Joss Whedon has created something unique, which somehow also feels familiar. There are many old movie tricks in here, but they are twisted into something new, something wonderfully refreshing. With traditional block busters dying a death, it's becoming more apparent that the public are starving for something new. Serenity gives us that.If you haven't seen the TV series, don't worry. Most, if not everyone I've talked to who's seen it and not seen the series had no problem following it, and getting the vast majority of the jokes. There are several nods to the series for the fans, as well (Wash's dinasaurs make a rather poignant appearance near the end, jokes were made about Mal and Inara's relationship, etc.) The dialogue flows, the action is supplimentary rather than essential to the plot, the violence is actually necissary rather than gratuitous and any deaths are handled in a gentle, understated and dignified way, rather than the tired, melodramatic and emotional type things that so often occurin sci-fi epics. Even the soundtrack is beautiful, again, adding to the plot rather than acting as a crutch for it. It doesn't preach about the rights and wrongs of the world. There's no clean cut good guys or bad (well, okay, there are bad guys, and there are really bad guys, but these bad guys are *not* what they seem.) Joss has actually accredited his audiences with *intelligence*. He's presumed we have *patience*. He's credited us with the ability to understand irony (shock horror!) And frankly, it is about damn time SOMEONE in the movie world woke up and realised that yes, movie-goers have brain cells.In short, if you're tired of the old, pradictable, melodramtic, dime-a-dozen block busters, go and see this movie. It's hilarious, heart-breaking, unpredictable and it contains a psychotic seventeen year old psychic who get's to play with knives. What's not to like? -Magpie",Serenity
1161,troubleshooter_512,"Nothing special, overrated!",3,28 November 2005,"Sorry, I don't understand, why so many people go so crazy about that movie. The plot is patched together from various other sources and is not at all convincing. The characters are shallow and stereotyped. The looks of the movie reminded me of Babylon 5 or Andromeda, which is okay for TV, but no more enough for a real movie. Towards the end there are some good fights and some moments of tension, therefore I'm not entirely disappointed, but from what I've read on the IMDb, I expected so much more. I won't talk about the good lines, that are mentioned in other comments, as I watched the German version and it's likely that all the good lines got crippled by the translation. To summarize:Maybe something for Firefly fans, but for a SciFi film it's not enough.",Serenity
1162,teeppeltjes,Misleading,2,2 July 2012,"I personally think the high rating of 7.9 is literally over rated. You got to be kidding me: Star wars III gets 6.4 and this movie a 7.9?The plot is really thin. There is no suspense and no exiting story line. Not once, was I captured by what I was looking at. The characters lack any sense of realism. Sci-fi or not, the actors should play like they believe it is all real. And these do not. At points it was painful seeing them stumbling through the plot.This was a very boring movie. Which was a disappointment as a 7.9 is rather high for a sci-fi movie, so I had my hopes up. However I thought one thing was very funny: The misplaced and failed attempt to make the lead (Nathan Fillion) look like the sun of both Luke Sky Walker and Indiana Jones.",Serenity
1163,exdreamer99,Nearly a Masterpiece,9,28 September 2005,"I had high expectations. Very, very high expectations. And this movie exceeded nearly all of them.As a recent fan of the ill-fated Fox series ""Firefly,"" I, like so many others, fell into the addictive world of that future that Joss Whedon created for us here. I HATE science fiction...I always have. Star Wars bores me, 2001: A Space Oddessy all but lost me (save for the magnificent cinematography), and Star Trek....well, suffice to say it probably deserved to die with its cheesy serial.I tell you that so that when I tell you that I thought ""Serenity"" was nearly a MASTERPIECE of movie-making and storytelling, you'll know what I mean. From the first five minutes of the film, I was absolutely hooked, and each frame seemed to bring a little more complexity, a little more fear, a little more humor, and a little more reason to lean a little closer to the screen. By the end of the first hour, I was all but leaning on the blue-haired old lady in front of me, trying to keep my mouth from slacking open in my state of rapt awe at the thundering storyline. It was a minute-by-minute RUSH...not because of flashy stars or even amazing special-effects....but by an old-fashioned combo: brilliant plot and even better acting. There were special effects galore, and more than a few old-fashioned fights and chases...but that's not what keeps you on the edge. It's the depth of the characterization...the writing is good enough to keep you involved in each of these nine characters individually, and to keep you guessing at how each character's personality traits (and neuroses) will carry you through the next moment.If you are a fan of the show, this movie is an absolute MUST-SEE. If you have never seen the show, I encourage you to check this movie out as soon as possible. The writing, acting and directing are stand-out terrific, and you won't be sorry. If you disliked the show...skip the movie. The movie takes everything that made the show what it was and magnifies, intensifies, and laser-focuses it.I hope you see this film, and I hope the creator releases a sequel of the same quality.",Serenity
1164,the_nihonjin,"If you loved the Firefly, you'll love this. If you didn't, whats wrong with you?",10,21 December 2005,"Simply put, this is an excellent movie. There is just nothing wrong with it. The script is all that Joss Whedon's brilliance can make it, the acting is totally wonderful, and the visual effects know their limits and soar within them. Watching the movie is enough to make you love it, but when you think of the fact that it was a TV show that got canceled before it completed a season and only lived on due to the complete infatuation with the 'verse put forth by fans, cast, crew, and Joss Whedon. In all honesty, if the movie had been shut down, there would have been a march on Fox for it. But Serenity stands well either as the last chapter of the ill fated show or as an independent story (though I can't think of a compelling reason not to watch the show, because it was absolutely brilliant). Summing it up, the only word I can think of to describe this movie is ""shiny"".",Serenity
1165,tiggerkid88,Best Movie Ever...,10,18 October 2005,"I would have to say that Serenity is the best movie ever. The plot, acting, special effects, beginning, ending, and everything else about it was so awesome. It has everything, romance, fist fights, gun fights, evil cannibals, stealing, death. It will make you fell almost every emotion a person can feel all in 2 hours.Orson Scott Card, the very brilliant Sci-fi author, has said that it is the best sci-fi ever. That means a lot. I am a long time fan of the show Firefly, so many my opinion is a little biased, but I have friends who have never seen the show and they loved the movie. Everyone should go see it and then go see it again and maybe a few more times after that for good measure. Yup... so there it is. Bestmovie ever. Go see it!",Serenity
1166,Jara75,Case scenario of how to make a bad movie.,4,28 November 2005,"It's not even worth to analyse this film, for that you would at least need a stable frame. Serenity, as it unfolds, races so many questions so many why's that in the end you stop to bother. Don't get me wrong I like sci-fi movies but they have to appeal in at least one category. This movie is an insult to the intelligence of the audience and at some point very confusing. The effects are not that good, they are OK but some things don't seem solid. The big issues in this film are the plot and the characters. The characters are boring, one dimensional and not credible. The moral in the film is many times ambiguous. And lastly the plot well When I saw this movie I got a strong feeling that the movie makers had a plan, an action plan. They wanted many fights at this and that location, at this and that time but they didn't bother to make it credible for the characters to get in those fights at those times.It seems these movies are everywhere these days. Brainless movies that cost billions to produce, obviously, despite the lack of finesse, they cover the bills. I'm really concerned about the high grades given by others, have we even seen the same movie? So I analysed it a bit anyway wellit's not worth the bucks I tell you that, see the Alien movies again they are far better.",Serenity

From the moment the movie started to the very end my eyes were riveted on the screen. This movie has it all, action, suspense, great special effects and a wonderful plot. The chemistry of the cast was amazing and the acting superb. This movie had me gasping at times, crying at times and laughing my ass off. It was a definite roller coaster ride with my emotions going up and down depending on what I was happening to witness on the screen. I highly, highly recommend this movie.If you're a fan of sci-fi, great acting and great storytelling get yourself to the theater, strap yourself in and sit back and enjoy!",Serenity

The majority of reviews have been very good, this movie will be word of mouth and should do very respectably for itself. An interesting thing to check out is the radio movie critics Max and Mike at: http://www.maxandmike.com/ Mike a Browncoat gave it 3 1/2 stars and Max, a FF virgin even gave the movie 3 stars (out of four). Later in the week the show will be available for download, they actually did their show on sat.(10/1) on TV shows and actors that transfer to movies in honor of Serenity.",Serenity
1169,pygmyunderground,"Brilliantly composed, under-watched",10,25 June 2006,"Well written, well filmed and well cast, Serenity is a joy to watch. The action is fast and exciting, hilarious throwaway lines numerous and the background to the entire ""'verse"" deep and believable, if the main premise (Earth overpopulated, new solar system found and made habitable) a common sci-fi theme. The characters have a rich back story, much of it revealed if the series the movie is based on, Firefly, is watched. However, if one is uninitiated in the show the language may be a bit tough the follow, ""shiny"", for example, being a slang term for cool but it takes a bit of attention to figure it out. Using the exact same cast as the show used before its cancellation, each actor feels comfortable as the character (possibly slight caricatures) he or she portrays, and this comfortability shows in the easy and fluid interactions between characters. Filming is very well done, and, in conjunction with the soundtrack, which fits the ""space western"" genre extremely well, leaves each scene with its own particular mood and pacing. The opening scene in which the credits are played is one long 5 minute shot, following the entire length of the ship as we are introduced to all the characters, each with a few (or more) titillating one-liners, which are sure to be endlessly quoted. It's a shame the show was cancelled; such a deep and fun show to watch is rare to find on today's network broad(wave)casting normally filled with reality drivel and soaps. However, it has a deep and loyal fan-base (there needn't be a hyphen there; IMDb needs to update its vocabulary), a nod to whom was given by the Sci-Fi channel as it played the show, non-stop, beginning to end before the premiere of the movie.Fun for the whole family, if slightly scary and possibly inappropriate for the younger watchers (but only if they don't have older brothers or young-feeling uncles).",Serenity
1170,betsyinferno,Still Shaking...,10,15 January 2006,"As a huge fan of Joss Whedon and his wonderful face I was fizzing with excitement at seeing the big screen continuation of Firefly. I had tickets for the opening day and was not disappointed at all. There has never been a film which has got me as enthusiastic or emotional about films in a long long time.I strain to think of a single bum note in the entire film and I can only imagine that others feel the same.The comedy is deftly executed, the action is on-the-edge-of-your-seat-stuff and there were several times in the film where I'm not ashamed to say that I had to choke back the tears.The recent news that there will be no film sequel is nothing short of criminal, especially when crap like Ocean's Thirteen and Fantastic Four 2 get the green-light.Still, with projects like Goners and Wonder Woman coming up it looks like there may well be a tiny, tiny glimmer of hope for the crew of Serenity to ride again.",Serenity
1171,gambit-lebeau,VERY underrated,10,17 November 2005,"OK, so maybe this is a 9 or 9.5 , but hopefully a little extra push will get some more people to check this out. It's unconventional in many ways, but very high quality work in terms of scripting, direction and acting. This is a worthwhile story and an intriguing universe and I hope we get to see more of it. I watched the TV show DVDs only a week or two after the film came out and was amazed the show didn't even last a single season. There are so many other programs with less creativity and less craft. It's pretty sad commentary on American culture that ""the Biggest Loser"" survives on air and Firefly doesn't. Joss, If you're reading out there -don't let them stop the signal.",Serenity
1172,twentworth,OK conclusion to the series,5,26 July 2006,"It's obvious that the purpose of this movie was to give Joss Whedon an outlet for the ideas that Fox never gave him the opportunity to develop with the prematurely-cancelled series. It's a fine conclusion to the 14 episodes that make up the series, but I really can't recommend this to someone who hasn't seen those episodes. Without that background, you'll still understand what's going on, but I doubt you'll be very engaged. That said, if you haven't seen the series, rent it - it's definitely worth watching - and then rent the movie. I doubt there's much of a possibility of a theatrical sequel, although further TV movies would be welcome. However, I doubt that Whedon had any further sequels in mind given the haphazard demise of some of the major characters.",Serenity

This year alone, I've lost count of how many times I've been to the cinema, and how many DVD's i've rented.Serenity, to me, represents a true event to be marked on the calender. This film has everything any movie goer could ever ask for.From it's exciting action sequences, and comedic narrative, to it's sudden dramatic shifts, and a handful of scares as certain pasts and truths reveal themselves. I know I've seen this twice already, and will probably see it a third time before it leave the cinemas. I would recommend, and i do to anyone who'll listen, that you go and see this movie.Our nine rebels have come along way, and although they were never given their full and deserved opportunity to shine on TV, i think this movie is a huge milestone for what Joss hoped to achieve, and i know that every fan under the sun appreciates this film.",Serenity

You cant understand a good 50% of what he is saying because of the horrific accent his character has.The only even remotely enjoyable part of this film was Ron Glass, a hugely underrated actor who shamefully doesn't get more work in Hollywood.For die-hard fans only.",Serenity

After I saw the WONDERFUL movie I bought the season (or the partial season) and now that I've watched them all I'm sooo sad. There were so many questions left unawsnered. It's killing me.At least Kaylee and Simon did get together finally. Their relationship during the series was so cute but at the same time excruciating.GAH, PLEASE GET EVERYONE YOU KNOW TO GO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATERS. THE BETTER THE BOX OFFICE THE MORE LIKELY THERE IS TO BE A CONTINUATION OF THE SERIES AND/OR A SEQUEL TO THE FILM.When I heard people comparing the movie to Star Wars I thought they must be crazy.

1176,sn00ze-1,Disappointing,7,1 October 2005,"I felt cheated. I still am (and still will be) a huge fan of Firefly but I felt the movie was just like another episode. Nothing more. I wanted so much more out of it, resolved mysteries, learn more about the characters (which made firefly so special compares to other sci-fi series) but yet, we learn really little more than what we can easily extrapolate from the series... Sure it resolved an environmental mystery (related to the Reavers) but to me, the Reavers would have been better to remain a mystery since it was adding more to the emotion of fear when the characters were getting involved with them. It shows that the writer/director is trying to revive the franchise and the movie just felt like a season finally, a good episode but not yet the ""end of the book"" movie I was expecting. I so wanted to know more about the shepherd... But I guess I can only wait and pray that the movie will do good enough for the series to revive in order to fill my appetite for more.",Serenity

Thoughtful, exciting, science fiction just isn't made like this anymore. Attention to detail, fabulous acting, and a cast that actually seems to enjoy working together as much as the audience enjoys watching them.I knew in the first ten minutes I was in for a heck of a trip, and I was not disappointed. At the risk of sounding like a lot of the other reviewers, I implore anyone who reads this that if you've not seen Serenity yet, perhaps because you never watched the series, please don't let that be a deterrent. Exposition, usually the bane of many an established story, is meshed in seamlessly here. You care about the world Joss has created, and more importantly, the characters that populate it.Serenity is a revelation.",Serenity

I have been so disappointed lately with science fiction movies but, this one just rocks. They have taken some time to create some real Characters. It made me laugh, cry, and scared the hell out of me(well, I am only 43). It reminded me very much of Star Wars and Indiana Jones. Especially the latter with the character ""Mal"" The effects are great. if this is not the beginning of a new franchise, I ll eat my hat. The only problem is it was finished far too quickly and I need to go and see it again and again and again. If you area fan of those kind of films, I will urge you to go and see it",Serenity

It is indeedsurprising what an amazing film Whedon can make with such a small budget.Can't wait for Serenity II.What I don't understand is why this film is not shown in cinemas in Israel (I have seen it in a sci fi festival)Probably because the managers heard how low budget it was and didn't even botherto watch it",Serenity

The main plot was changed but a concept of diffused worlds, freelancing mercenaries among units holding order, illegal well-payed missions is unmistakeably same. Even some music themes are the same... Some ideas were taken from Descent Freespace (like disruptive clouds or laser beams). I don't want to say that Serenity shall be a collection of best tricks from the games, like they tried to do in Doom (unfortunately they only tried).

1182,joker667,A true roller-coaster of a movie,10,24 December 2005,"Joss Whedon wrote and directed this gem of a movie filled with a cornucopia of scenes designed to invoke laughter, fear, tears, and awe from everyone. Joss admitted in an interview that ""Serenity"" was the hardest thing he ever wrote. Now, I've never really watched the TV series ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" or its spin-off ""Angel"", but I've seen ""Firefly"" so I can honestly say that I'm unbiased about his work on TV. With that said, I will say this with conviction that ""Serenity"" is a well-scripted movie helmed quite nicely by Joss on his directorial debut.""Firefly"" was canceled abruptly after 11 episodes (with 3 remaining unaired episodes). Some time after that cancellation, a poll was conducted on IMDb, asking the voters to rank which canceled TV show was the most undeserving of being axed. ""Firefly"" came in 2nd, behind ""Family Guy"". ""Family Guy"" became the 1st ever canceled TV show to be resurrected after strong DVD sales. 20th Century Fox issued only 200,000 copies of ""Firefly"" DVD set (including the 3 unaired episodes). All were quickly sold. Another 200,000 copies were issued and all were sold. To this date, over 500,000 copies of ""Firefly"" have been sold. This gave Joss the impetus to make a movie, 1st time this has ever happened with a canceled TV show.I believe that you do not need to watch ""Firefly"" in order to follow the movie ""Serenity"", but doing so would allow you to be more finely attuned to the intricacies of the relationships & loyalty among the ship's crew members. Captain Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds is a man of ever-shifting morals and sense of justice who, at the drop of a hat, will show a side of himself that his crew has never seen. Serenity is piloted by Hoban ""Wash"" Washburn, a crackerjack pilot who has a wry sense of humor and is married to Zoe, who fought the Alliance in a losing war with Mal. Jayne Cobb is a brute who unapologetically likes weapons, pain, and self-gratification. Kaywinnet Lee ""Kaylee"" Frye is a female mechanic who has a way with the heart and soul of Serenity. Inara Serra is a ""Companion"" (think high-class ""escort"") whose presence aboard Serenity help bring respect to the ship and cause unwanted emotions in Mal. Simon Tam is a former Alliance doctor who turned away from his lucrative practice to help his sister, River. River is a gifted young woman whose mental talents are highly and dubiously prized by shadow figures in the Alliance. Together, they create cohesion and tension while on the run from the Alliance for taking the Tams in.All you have to do is sit back, watch, and experience the gamut of emotions evoked by an excellent script and solid acting coupled with logical need for action sequences (they are on the run after all and they need to survive).",Serenity
1183,jgprice,Definitely not an 8.4 out of 10...,5,28 September 2005,"I was given the opportunity to see an advance screening and review Serenity for my college paper and I grabbed it after seeing the 8.4 rating that it has garnered on this site. Coming out of the film, however, I was immensely disappointed. Not only was the film definitely not as good as I had expected, but it just wasn't that good. The acting was mediocre, CGI not of first-tier quality, and the storyline, though interesting, wasn't very compelling. Add to that the fact that throughout the movie I was constantly thinking to myself how components of the movie were borrowed from prior films. Just to rattle off a few, the ship Serenity seemed to be a cross between the Millennium Falcon and the Nebuchadnezzar, the character River Tam a combination of Luke/Leia Skywalker as well as Milla Jovovich's character from the Fifth Element (and even Brittany Murphy's character in Don't Say a Word, though this was probably just me), the Planetary Alliance in this film too reminiscent of the Galactic Empire etc etc. The dialog is also about as cliché as that used in Star Wars. To me, the 5 I gave this movie is an average rating, despite its lack of originality it was entertaining and did have many redeeming points. Those would be some impressive fight choreography, some amusing one liners (especially by Jewel Staite's character), and of course Alan Tudyk, after playing a pirate wanna-be in Dodgeball, finally has his dream come true in this film and that alone is funny to watch. But, as I ultimately wrote in my review, unless you were a die-hard Firefly fan, there are better uses for $10.",Serenity
1184,mfluderx,A superb piece of film making and a great storyline to boot,10,8 October 2005,"I have just got home from seeing 'Serenity' and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this is the best science-fiction film of the last couple of years.'The Matrix' had the kung fu, 'Star Wars' had the digital effects, but 'Serenity' has an engaging and interesting storyline, with characters who you can identify with.I don't want to give anything away, but this film will blow you away. It breaks from normal Sci-fi fare and layers an interesting and engaging story that sucks you in for 2 hours that is by turns, amazing, shocking, violent, and smart. The characters come across as real people, with real problems. This isn't the dark view of 'Bladerunner' or the utopia of 'Star Trek', but a story embedded in a completely possible future reality.This film has I believe has something for everyone, you don't need to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy it either, as it is a film about characters and situations that anybody can relate to in someway.As a side note I have seen the TV series 'Firefly' that the film is based on, BUT you do not need to have seen any of the TV episodes to enjoy this film as the film exists as a complete story unto its self.",Serenity
1185,termi0815,Mediocre,6,14 December 2005,"First of all, i saw the dubbed German version. I think the synchronization is done quite poorly, so I'll try to watch the original version some day. The scenes and effects are nicely done, the sound apart from the German voices were alright. The acting, as far as i can judge, was okay, i did like Summer Glau (Rice). The story is told consequently, but i seemed to miss the part where it really got me. Though the movie creates quite an intense feeling most of the time, there are scenes which remind me of bad Star Trek Episodes. Like the whole crew standing around somewhere on a deck and the story slowly advancing... most of them just look like they don't belong anywhere. Another thing about the story is, that it's quite elevated, so if you like heroes and the standard love themes you'll be well served. But if you go for an really interesting or unpredictable story, this is not your movie. I still give it an 6 because it's a well done action movie, with perhaps a little bit to much pathos.",Serenity
1186,lord0faiiusion,Amazing Film,10,16 January 2007,"I first saw a preview for this film at Wizard World Chicago a few months before it came out. Prior to this I had never seen Firefly or even heard anything about it. I might have seen it on the preview channel or something, but I never got around to it. After seeing the preview however, I turned away from the little pirated copy on the little TV, turned to my cousin who was with me and said, ""I have no idea what that film is about, but I want to see it."" Unfortunately I was a little busy that summer and didn't get around to seeing it until a good while later. I saw the first 10 minutes of it on Youtube and was hooked. I was obsessed and so excited to see it I could have used a change of shorts.I Netflix'd it immediately and got it a few days later.From beginning to end it's not only amusing and entertaining, but it is a beautiful film to look at. It's a flawless little bit of visual stylings that you believe. The style and world, or rather, universe is created so perfectly that you believe that in the future people will live like it's the wild west.This frontier lifestyle just makes so much sense and is a fresh new look at the future. With the regional colloquialisms and lingo Joss Whedon really has created an entire universe for us to enjoy.The story follows Malcom ""Mal"" Reynolds and the crew of the Firefly class ship called Serenity. Mal and his crew of questionable reputation (Especially Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin) who is more or less a mercinary) who will take any job they can find throughout the 'verse both legal and illegal.The government (refered to as The Alliance or Parliament) sends an ""Agent"" with no rank or name to hunt down Simon, Serenity's resident Doctor and his sister, River, who is the real target. Why is River Tam, the 16 year old sister of a Brilliant alliance Doctor gone fugitive such a threat to the worlds of the alliance? What could this little girl have that's so important that they'd ruthlessly kill anyone in their path? The story is just filled with unpredictable twists and turns. Every time you expect them to go in the usual direction that action movies go, they turn tail and run the other way.One of the men Mal works for put it best, ""You're unpredictable Mal. You run when you ought to fight, fight when you ought to deal."" While this may be a spoiler, I'll leave you this hint. The amazing thing about Joss Whedon is he's not afraid to cripple, maim, or kill off characters. With the entire alliance fleet after this one unarmed cargo ship, how many of the Serenity crew will make it out alive? Fans of Firefly will love this Sci Fi western and people new to the franchise had best get their copy. When you're done with the movie there's a whole series you didn't know about called Firefly which I also highly recommend. Hell, pick up the series and then watch the movie, as it was meant to be! It'll not be time wasted.",Serenity
1187,Anakin64_,Serenity - Final Print NO SPOILERS,9,25 August 2005,"Where to begin. Just attended a premiere here in Australia, where we were advised this was the final print. Previous showings in Australia apparently differed slightly in the score.Firstly Whedon has done an admirable job of transposing a TV Series into a blockbuster. This has enabled him a budget greater than he could have dreamed with Firefly. This however means that he has the added pressure of making every dollar count on the screen, by that I mean, everything has to be bigger to satisfy the bean counters.Cast wise, it was great to see the gang back together 9 months later. This means that the characters have moved on and grown, just as all people do.The space & battle scenes are good, but in my opinion, not quite as good as the space battle in Star Wars Episode 3, but this did not greatly detract from the experience.In closing, I am satisfied that, as a Firefly fan, Whedon will not disappoint any of us, however I am not sure that the movie will be as accessible to the general public. I can only hope.",Serenity

This is certainly the best SF movie of the year.Our big damn heroes are really small men and women caught in bad times. This is familiar territory to those who like American Westerns and their attendant myths.Out on the frontier, the rules change. People don't, except in a bad way. And yet sometimes, you have to step up and misbehave.The movie covers a lot of narrative ground, and has plenty of dialog to keep up with, but it is rewarding that it never feels talky and keeps the character dynamic front and center.A treat for fans and newcomers. Thank you, everyone involved.",Serenity
1189,moofrules,Awesome!,8,9 October 2005,"I was a fan of the Firefly series, and so I looked forward to this movie and I was not disappointed. Snappy dialog, excellent acting, great storyline, it was just plain entertaining. The special effects only added to the story, they did not overwhelm as they tend to do in some other like-genre movies. (i.e. the most recent Star Wars) My husband did not see the series on which this movie was based and he even he thought it was well worth the 10 dollar ticket price. (This from the who will only go to a matinée because they are cheaper!) I hope that this flick does well enough to warrant another one, this was a terrific film and Joss should be proud!",Serenity
1190,midgedakin,Serenity The best of the year,10,10 October 2005,"OK the year has seen some big films Star wars and others but not one has had me waiting like a kid waiting for Xmas. But Serenity did that to me. I watched Firfly and I was hooked on it I watch an episode at east once a day. When I heard about Serenity I buzzed round my house.OK so we have the crew of Serenity not your everyday group of people they ain't part of a big group of ships in a fleet, They are pretty much everyday people running round getting odd jobs, Until Simon shows up with his sister River. There begins the worse thing Mal and the rest of the Serenity crew can imagine as the rest of the 'Verse is after River one side ""Alliance"" is after her knowledge of what she knows. The others ""Reavers"" are just after everything.So my advice for all you readers is go see the film and see what they go through to save them selves before I give too much away.10 out of 10 must see",Serenity
1191,Bruce_,Best sci-fi feature in a long time,9,28 September 2005,"******* no spoilers *********Right from the start you know you're in for an adventure and this film doesn't let you down.The plot was superb, characters great and the special effects very well done.I hope George Lucas will watch serenity and realise how to make a sci-fi film. Maybe he can hire Joss to do some script writing for him, although Joss may refuse the job offer.After this epic I anticipate more amazing produce from Mr Whedon.Go see it, buy the TV series, tell your friends! 9.6/10",Serenity
1192,cailztvs,Well Gorram.,10,30 September 2005,"Gorram indeed. If you are a fan of Firefly, this movie will blow your mind. If you are not a fan of Firefly, this movie will blow your mind. Amazing actors, Amazing Special Effects, Great Storyline, Great Costume. And those Reavers were incredibly horrifying. Joss Whedon has outdone himself and even though some things happened that I wish didn't it doesn't take away from the fact that this was an awesome movie and is now one of my favorites. I am incredibly glad to see, finally, how the story ends for some of my favorite characters. I have bucketloads of gratitude for Universal Pictures for giving Joss the chance to tell their story. Can't Stop the Signal",Serenity
1193,pob_or,Baldwin Steals Show,10,11 October 2005,"Have been waiting to see this movie for ages, and when i came out of the cinema i had a real empty feeling. It was a feeling of, ""i want more"". This film was awesome, amazing, and brilliant, and as i said i want more. Everyone will come out having watched this with a liking for every character on the serenity crew, but i have to admit that Jayne was easily my favourite. Adam Baldwin has been about for awhile now, but this role seems like it was made for him. He is perfect for the role and he steals the show, which is no mean feat when you see some of the performances of the other characters in the film. Some of the Banter between Jayne and Mal is some of the funniest stuff you'll see in any films this year. One of the best movies i have ever watched.",Serenity
1194,imdb-4999,TRULY excellent sci-fi,10,26 December 2005,"I have never posted a review to IMDb before, but I feel like Serenity is deserving of a writeup. When ""Firefly"" (the series this movie is based on) originally aired on TV a couple of years back, I didn't even KNOW it existed. The show aired and was cancelled before I ever even found out about it. It was only when Serenity the movie was made that the original series started to get a lot of buzz.After reading about the original series, I downloaded all of the original Firefly episodes and my wife and I were immediately hooked. Serenity is basically a continuation and to some extent a much needed conclusion to the series. The series seemed to have been cut off in mid-stride -- there were a lot of questions left unanswered that the movie does a good job of tying up.So, to a large extent, when I'm talking about the movie Serenity, the same comments apply to the original series as well. I can't help but be reminded of what network executives told Gene Roddenberry when he pitched the original ""Star Trek"" series back in the mid-60s: when those suits got a look at the pilot episode for Star Trek, they shelved it and made Roddenberry come up with something else. Not because it was badly done, but because it was too GOOD. Serenity is the same way -- there is so much thought and effort that has obviously gone into creating this story's world. The storyline in Serenity is quite original, very engaging, easy to follow and full of lots of twists and turns. My wife and I were literally sitting on the edge of the couch the entire time we watched the movie (we have tons of kids, so we had to wait for the movie to come out on video).But probably the thing that is most noteworthy about Serenity is the dialogue. I don't have anything insightful to say about it like a professional reviewer would, but suffice it to say that it is really well done. All kinds of slang expressions are used throughout that obviously had to be made up and created. There's a kind of ""sing-song"" nature to the way people in this time period speak that is so believable, not to mention enjoyable. You know it's not how people in OUR world speak, but it doesn't seem at all unrealistic either.This has got to be one of the most original, interesting and enjoyable scifi movies I have watched in a REALLY long time, and I have watched a bunch. I simply cannot recommend this movie highly enough to anyone who likes a good story and amazing characters!",Serenity
1195,cj_pyke,Serenity Aimed High and Flew True,10,2 October 2005,"This movie can be summed up in one word: Brilliant. The story was extremely well planned out and was executed with amazing style. The writing was superb, everything was said at the right times in the right ways, especially the clever one-liners. Everyone can enjoy this movie even if you weren't a previous fan of the Firefly series. Great performances from all the original cast and from the newcomers. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys an adventure set in space with loads of action with a western style or just to anyone that enjoys a good movie.",Serenity
1196,wks-682-334416,Drivel so far,1,10 May 2013,"I can't get past the first 10 minutes. It is the most wooden, awful, childish, ridiculous (and very American) dialogue and acting I have seen in a long time. Maybe it get's better. Not sure if I can cope with another 10 minutes! Why some other people have given it better reviews is beyond me. Maybe it is one of those films that you have to stick with. No it isn't - I just watched another 5 minutes and it is still total drivel. WHY do film makers make this sort of special effects nonsense? There is nothing that vaguely resembles an adult story line and one childish cliché follows another. Utter rubbish. I simply haven't got the time, patience or stupidity to stick with something that promises to be a ridiculous film in which the only people who can shoot straight are the heroes (American of course)and in which the most basic rules of common sense have to be suspended, Like a man's grip being sufficient to hold on to a rail whilst travelling at high speed.",Serenity
1197,unicornrider00,Serenity-no spoilers but better safe then sorry,10,2 October 2005,"I saw the movie last night. I had never seen anything of the TV series except parts of 1 episode. My dad went to see the movie with me. We loved it! My dad doesn't even like TV all that much and he wants to get the TV series. It was an exceptionally well-done movie. Even if you had never seen the series like me, the movie was so good that you didn't even mind being brought in in the the middle. I really hope they bring the series back! I was happy that I had seen some old characters from some of Buffy and Angel. It made it easier to identify with the movie with characters that I recognized. Plus, it was interesting to see them in entirely opposite rolls from their previous parts.",Serenity
1198,elluviel,Best science fiction movie I've seen in a very long time,10,30 September 2005,"This was the best movie I've seen at the theater this year. If you were a fan of Firefly, stop reading this review and go see Serenity. Now. If you were on the fence, consider doing the same. If you hated the series, I don't know what to tell you, but you may be missing out.What to expect? You'll laugh, you'll cry (sometimes at the same time), you'll gasp because you're freaked out, and then you'll gasp in utter and complete shock (I'm thinking of one scene in particular with the last one... if you've seen it, you know).There's also an absolutely spectacular space battle scene, that is breathtaking in more ways than one. It's beautiful, and at the same time extremely visceral; you feel like you're there with them, swooping to and fro, like a roller-coaster ride you don't want to get off. This scene makes all other space combat scenes that have come before weep at what they might have been. You are a leaf, in a very strong wind.",Serenity
1199,Bochista,Lots of fun,10,30 September 2005,"The movie was very fun to see. It never became about what science might or might not be able to do. Instead it was a just a setting for a good story. It kept its focus on the characters and the actors delivered well.The characters have reactions you can believe, and the actions have a clear origin. I would like to see the movie take place in more open areas. It looks like sound stages are used throughout the film, but it's understandable considering the budget this film had. Overall it's a wonderful and very enjoyable film.If you see it you'll be drawn in and have a really good time.",Serenity
1200,jc-190,Another Whedon nose-dive,3,30 March 2006,"Considering the peetering ending of the BUFFY finale, then the over forced end to the ANGEL saga, I went to this film with limited hope. Rather than leave the future lives of protagonists to the imagination, Whedon prefers to end them finally. The problem is, he attempts to take a hundred or more shortcuts every time to wrap up all sorts of interesting threads begun in any saga. The result is dissatisfying every time. And most of all in Serenity.River becomes some type of psychic/psychotic Buffy clone, Reevers turn out to be some grand plot gone awry by the evil ""empire"" of the unifying government, and once again we are treated to the unfelt death of a favorite character from the series. I wished I'd never seen this film to have it taint my awareness when I rewatch the astounding series called FIREFLY.",Serenity
1201,pnmintiloglitis,Awful.. 7.9??? how????,1,17 July 2013,"This movie is bad. The story line was combed together from several mindless Hollywood action movies; it is predictable; it is full of plot holes; and the twist, or solution, or whatever that thing was supposed to be near the end, is mind-bogglingly lame.The movie has very little of the wild west atmosphere of the series, and barely any Mandarin.It has an idiotic moral. Some moral may be unavoidable, but does it have to be the worst anti- rationalist cliché? Non-geeks may not find this as unforgivable as I did, but: when things blow up in outer space, they do not make a sound. No air, no sound. How hard is that? Joss knew this when he made the series -- how did he forget it when he made the movie?On the other hand, the characters from the series are all there, they are still great, even if they got flattened a bit. The acting is okay, and some of the dialog is funny (though most episodes had more good lines than the whole movie).Do not watch this film. Rent the series on DVD instead.",Serenity
1202,jeremy-gragg,"Different from the series, but equally excellent.",10,26 December 2005,"I am one of those souls who discovered this show all too late. It wasn't until this movie was in the theater that I watched the original television show, which I instantly became enamoured with. However, by that time and with my schedule, I didn't get a chance to watch the movie in the theater.Having just seen it on DVD, I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone, regardless of whether or not they saw the series. While the television show was special in its own right, the movie is an entirely different beast; it is faster paced, has an excellent ""villan"" and leaves you wanting more...just as it should.This movie is technically science-fiction, but I like to think of it as more than that; it is a fusion of genres that produce an excellent story...far surpassing Star Wars (and I'm one of those guys who has read EVERY Star Wars book out there).My friend, my most recent brown-coat (show fantastic) convert told me that Serenity is #10 on Bittorrent downloads...which is nice but also a shame. I'll admit that I first watched the show that was downloaded, but then I voted with my dollars and went out and bought Serenity and the TV Show Boxed set...I voted with my dollars, which is what we need to do to get the next installment in this series. Thankfully, the movie is #1 at Amazon right now and the show is #3 in DVD sales.ARgh....I cannot stress enough how great this show is...and no one deserves a spoiler. Check it out. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",Serenity
1203,defyallreason,just perfect,10,21 August 2005,"I like thousands of other ""Firefly"" fans have been waiting for this movie since the show was canceled in late 2002 after only 13 episodes. Set 500 years in the future we see many scary things like the world operating on windows and a government who makes people insane (literally). We find Malcom (Mal) Reynolds leading a ""brown coat"" ship (anti union of allied planets aka the alliance)with the only two things that stayed with him through the tragic battle of serenity valley. his pistol and his first mate Zoe. Zoe leads the crew after Mal keeping control over everybody from Wash her husband and the pilot to Jayne the uneducated brawn with a gun named Vera. She looks after the mechanic Kaylee and the two fugitives Simon the doctor and the very insane River Tam, who's backgrounds we look into during this movie. We also encounter the lovely Inara Serra, a registered companion and former resident on the ship. We see the alliance's desperate attempts to regain River who they formerly held captive in a learning facility. We stay with the crew to the violent, heartbreaking end on the ship Serenity captained by Mal Reynolds and Crew",Serenity

He went a second time with his girl friend and his best friend, and then he begged me to go. I reluctantly went, wanting to see ""Proof"" instead. At 48, I was a big fan of the original Star Trek series and saw the original Star Wars and Star Trek movies, but I was not prepared for Serenity! I was captivated from the moment the movie started and sat mesmerized throughout the entire adventure. I walked out of the movie a devoted fan. The following week I bought the DVD set of all of the Firefly episodes and am rationing the episodes out, hoping to make them last as long as possible. The writing is superb; witty and ""true"", the characters are original and endearing, and the action is non-stop! On the whole, the Movie and series are far superior than any Star Wars episode I've ever seen. Thank you Joss Whedon and crew, but now I'm hooked and want more!",Serenity
1205,planey,Highly overrated *SPOILERS*,5,11 March 2006,"** SPOILERS INCLUDED ** I didn't ever see the TV show, so I had some big expectations for this movie, after seeing some clips and reviews.The movie started of well, but at some point, the suspense, the feeling that i almost care what happens to crew, it just disappeared. Was it the dialog (jokes which didn't make you laugh or even smile), acting, script? I don't know. At times the feeling came back, but mainly it was just waiting the movie to end.River's character was a disappointment, she wasn't as big prodigy or a huge weapon as the early parts of the movie let you to expect. I thought she was about to save or destroy world by herself, but seems like her only skills were kungfu fighting and some sort of sensing of things. If we compare her to female-weapons like 'Sil' in 'Species' (not saying Species is a good movie) or 'Leeloo' in 'Fifth Element' (FE IS a good movie), River is, well nothing. Only threat to Alliance she had was the knowledge. So those Bruce Lee skills she had seemed to be a bit pointless in the end. And wasn't that termination of River supposed to be quiet operation? Didn't look too quiet to me. I mean, a couple of assassins would have been OK, but.. geez.The visual effects were partly amazing (e.g. alliance vs reavers battle-scene), but at times, for some strange reason, i thought i was watching a low-budget scifi series. The story about the world as a better place and explanation how reavers were born were nice ideas. But because of flaws here and there, it's just an average Scifi adventure, you might want to see once.",Serenity
1206,ajmack,Grossly Overrated,4,22 May 2006,"I rented this movie expecting a stellar film. With an overall rating of 8.0, it rates (on IMDb) above movies such as Mystic River, V for Vendetta, Big Fish, Magnolia, The Hustler, Scarface, Gone with the Wind, Toy Story, and Groundhog Day. Ten minutes into the movie, it was obvious that I was watching something more on the level of a high school production. Sure, there was a noticeably large budget with plenty of pretty effects, but the acting and especially the script (oh the script!) made me wince.There is a reason this is not on IMDb's top 250 despite it's high rating. Clearly it's ranking has been inflated by people who are overly biased to Mr. Whedon's show and who have not actually seen enough good movies. Not that I am faulting people who like this movie, but most people who care about films, if they can stomach the two-hour mess, will find vast dissatisfaction.To the general movie-going public: Do not let the rating deceive you. This is a shoddy movie, with the quality of acting clouded by an absolutely horrendous script. It is more fit for afternoon television, and even then it would be the last thing I would watch.",Serenity

I mean, its only a movie, right? But on the other hand, you just want to go out and tell people how great it was so they might experience the same pleasure that you did. and when it is over, you'll miss it, just like an old friend.....So many say, ""I turned my friends on to this flick, and they were hooked just like I was......"" I recommend that you watch the movie first, and then BUY the boxed series. Don't spend good money just renting it, because you'll want to watch it again, and thats a fact.Thank you Firefly.

1209,simpsons407,"Stereotypical sci-fi film, plagued by corny lines and weak plot",1,10 January 2006,"This film was very weak in many respects. The characters were shallow, underdeveloped and lacking a genuine personality. One character was simply the personification of anger. The acting was weak, and the story was quite lacking in substance or symbolism. A shadowy ""Alliance"" is more of a simple Disney definition of evil. Rather than such simple images of evil, it would have been much appreciated if characters had shades of grey. It was foolish of this director in the final easily predicable fight scene between the captain and his nemesis to have him clothed completely in Black, with shadow on his forehead. To show evil in this manner is simply the lazy man's way out.Overall this is a film to avoid if you enjoy sci-fi, or if you are not into sadistic self torture.",Serenity
1210,blowfish_106,Exactly what the contemporary sci-fi genre needs,10,1 October 2005,"Fantastic. Simply fantastic. I've been a fan of the series for about a year, and I've been looking forward to the movie since February (2005). I was, of course, more than a little anxious going into it; terrified that it would fall short of incredible. But the moment our beloved ship hit ""atmo"" and lit its engines to stirring background music, I burst into applause along with the rest of the packed theater.Rather than fade, our exuberance held steady as (director/deity) Joss took us through the emotional and visual roller-coaster.Is it derivative? Don't be dense, of course it is. It's a freakin' western. But it builds on what it derives so uniquely, it creates something wholly different. For example, at one point when our Big Damn Heroes are desperately zig zagging through a space battle, you can't help but think of Star Wars III. More to the point, you can't help but think of how this outshines even that signature sequence.And this is definitely not just a fan flick. I went with a group of people that included two who were unfamiliar with the series, and they said it was the best movie they had seen in a loong time. I asked them if they had any trouble following the characters and how they related to each other, and they said ""not at all."" For the fans.. questions will be answered to great satisfaction, others will be left untouched, and people will die. See this movie.For the uninitiated.. time to come aboard.",Serenity

The story arc for the film is not the least episodic, nor is it left hanging in preparation for sequels or a television revival. For those who have been desperately awaiting this return of the Firefly 'verse, the film delivers fully on the stories we all ached to see through and get answers about. Joss Whedon proves himself as a true cinematic artist, wasting not a single frame of the picture, offering viewers dynamic and unforgettable visuals, not to mention a number of scenes so scary I cannot remember any other films with which to compare them offhand. This movie is everything fans hoped it could be, and it will create multitudes of new fans to join in the clamor for more Firefly!",Serenity
1213,nebojats,"Great for fans, hopefully great for newcomers.",10,2 September 2005,"I'm a major fan of Firefly. I have been one since the series was pushed into my hands against my will over six months ago. That night, I found myself to be in a lull between all the chaos which is college homework, and I popped a disk in. By the fourth episode, I was completely hooked. Two days later, I'd finished the series. The show has a killer combination of gritty realism, amazing characters, and the wittiest dialogue I'd ever seen in TV.Coming from this perspective, Serenity is perfect. If you know the show, be prepared for a movie that captures the essence of Firefly, but brings it all to a whole new level. It almost has a sort of epic feel to it, but without any of the Star Wars self-importance vibe that is completely overbearing. It's just about normal people being put in an extraordinary situation and trying their hardest to do what they think is right. I would say the dialogue is just as witty, but expect far less humorous fluff. There are stretches of action/drama/horror that left me gripping the handles of my seat. These scenes were so involving, that it was only afterwards when I realized there had been gaps without the typical Firefly jokes being juggled between characters.The special effects are definitely on par with anything in Hollywood currently. The soundtrack retains the sound of a mutt culture of various world cultures combined. I personally found the cinematography to be both artsy and gripping. Several times during the movie, I thought to myself, ""that is amazing camera-work"". All in all, I have to say I've never felt this much of... an emotional impact from a movie. When I woke up this morning, it was one of the first things I thought about.My only worry is how the film will appear to non-browncoats. I really can't see how this movie won't please any fan of the show. If you liked what made the show great and are attached to the characters already, this is 99.99% guaranteed to satisfy (the .01% of dissatisfaction is reserved for those who get seizures or motion sickness in movie theaters). Try as I might, I can't look at the movie from the perspective of someone who knows little or nothing about Firefly. I believe that for these viewers, there is a good amount of exposition at the beginning of the film (not too long to be boring). Someone could easily understand the Firefly universe on a large scale, but it might be hard for a newcomer to truly grasp the small details like the relationships between various members of the crew. I also think that there is something for everybody in this film. Sci-fi, drama, horror, comedy, action, even a little bit of romance are present. In a month, we'll all know how the film will be received by the larger public.P.S. As a browncoat, I feel obligated to say, if you want a friend to like the film, just show them the show. If they like the show, they'll like the movie.",Serenity
1214,Captin777,This movie ROX!!,10,16 October 2005,"I am a huge fan of this movie and of Joss. He has an amazing skill of creating characters that are truly living and have real feelings.I really believe that everyone should take the time to go see this movie. It has the ability to apeal to all viewers, not just those who have seen Firefly. It ties up some loose ends(i.e. Simon and Kaylee), while creating others(will River become more normal now that the Secret is now in the open).I cannot wait to see if there are going to be sequels to Serentiy, though it most certainly deserves them and leaves gaps that could easily be filled.",Serenity
1215,hammerattack,Does Not Disappoint,10,3 October 2005,"You don't have to be a fan of Firefly to enjoy this movie. You don't even have to have heard of it. In jumping from the small screen to the big screen, Whedon avoided plenty of common mistakes and produced a standalone movie which neither disappoints the hardcore fan, nor leaves the laymen dumbfounded. Better still, the trailers and teasers did nothing to betray the plot and story. This movie pulls all the stops - comedy, drama, action, and intrigue. It also manages to leave room for a sequel, or a return of the series, without leaving gaping holes in the movie. Each character gets fair treatment, and there is still plenty of development without overpacking the two hour runtime. Love the show even more now - can't wait for the DVD.",Serenity
1216,rdemeran,Fulfilled a need,10,1 October 2005,"I have seen every episode of ""Firefly"". Joss Whedon has created a group of characters that are not to just be appreciated, they are to be loved, and if not admired, at least cared about. This movie continues that feeling. I purposefully stayed away from all material concerning the content of this movie before it was released, and I can honestly say that while there were things in the movie that I did not WANT to happen, as far as the characters are concerned. However, this movie was EVERYTHING I NEEDED it to be. Maybe I took the characters a little closer to heart than any reasonable person should, but I can say that as things progressed through the movie, I felt as if these were my friends, and it became more than fiction. This became a tale that was being related about close friends. I FELT their pain, appreciated their humour, and sympathised with their losses. Bravo, Joss Whedon, and damn you for putting my friends through that Hell.",Serenity
1217,planetnik,What an excellent movie!,10,3 September 2005,"Having become a real fan of Firefly I was worried, to say the least, that the movie would not meet my expectations. I got a chance to see Serenity at the Edinburgh Film Festival and it was superb! For anyone who has not seen Firefly (I would urge you to buy the DVD Box set) the story is a Space Western set in the future and revolves around the nine individuals involved with Serenity, a spaceship, Firefly class.All the usual suspects from Firefly are there and the movie focuses on Simon and River's story. Summer Glau is amazing as River and the rest of the cast were brilliant.Jayne is one of my favourite characters as he always seems to get the best lines and Serenity was no exception.You will be scared, cry and laugh as Serenity takes you on an emotional ride with lots of action as well.This film is a real winner and I can only hope that Joss Whedon gets a chance to make a sequel or two. Even better if Firefly the TV series is resurrected after the movies!",Serenity
1218,RPColtrane,It's pretty good.,5,30 September 2005,"I went into this movie having never seen the TV series and not being a ""super fan"" of Buffy or Angel like my wife. About twenty minutes into the movie she leaned over and said ""I can't believe how bad the acting is"". She almost had it right, it wasn't that the acting is as bad as it appears (and it appears to be good high school overacting), it's that the characters can't pull off the cheese heavy dialogs. Almost everything that comes out of the ""Capt."" and his crew's mouth feels like they just read the script off stage and are trying their damn-est to make you think they believe what they're saying. The good thing is after awhile you start to get into the movie and it doesn't become as distracting. The story also feels a little tired. You'll see what's coming long before the characters do, but if you let yourself go with it, it's a fun and amusing movie. The thing I enjoyed the most was the performance of the lead villain. He was dead on and he really created a great bad guy. I'd watch this movie again just for his performance or a movie just about his character's backstory.In summary, it's a fun, flawed little Sci-Fi movie but it's not the second coming of George Lucas, as some would have you believe. Heck, George Lucas isn't even George Lucas anymore. Roscoe",Serenity

The Pilot Episode of FireFly ""Serenity"" is kinda like an old western, you get this western vibe from the movie as well, witch i loved. it was different then any other sci-fi movie. and there's alotta cheese aspect to.",Serenity
1220,Mira_B,"Admittedly, I'm a fan. However, . . .",10,22 December 2005,"Basically, I came into the film loving the show and ready to love the film, but I have tried to keep an ear open to everyone else. Most of the excuses that I hear for not liking Serenity are that people don't like science fiction films, or that it required too much thinking, or that they didn't like a female protagonist beating people up. In which case, I'm left wondering why you saw the movie in the first place? I was worried that people who hadn't seen the show wouldn't understand the film. Everyone I know who saw the film but hadn't seen the series looked at me as if I was insulting their intelligence by even asking. It is fast paced, (there are four or five false beginning sequences which introduce different aspects of the world) but in any 2 hour movie based on a television series you have to be willing to pay attention. The characters are all rich and beautifully acted, and the old west dialect either bothers you or doesn't. The humor is brilliant and dry, common in most Joss Whedon works, and the action is exciting and big and all that action should be.The other big worry that everyone had was that this film would be Buffy in space with cowboys. It's not. There are some similarities, but if a writer/director/storyteller plays to his strengths, there's nothing wrong with that. If you didn't like Buffy or Angel, that's fine, it won't necessarily stop you from liking Serenity.",Serenity

I was not let down by the screenplay or the acting, rather the gore.As a PG-13 movie I was expecting a lot less violence and graphic scenes... apparently not. I LOVED the idea of the movie, but I thought there were many scenes of unnecessary gore... I felt that I was emotionally and mentally unprepared for this imagery... and that it should have had a higher rating, like R.Parents, before you take your underage kids to see this movie, PLEASE consider the after affects first. Some people may disagree with me, but this is my personal opinion of the graphic nature of this film... -soccerstr12345",Serenity

My expectations were enormously high after reading so much hype on the internet over the past few months, and I can honestly say that it exceeded them all.I can't add much of anything to what has already been said so many times. Just see the movie - it will not disappoint!! You'd be hard-pressed to find a movie that provides a more entertaining 2 hours of fun than this one. Fan of Firefly or never even heard of Firefly - both types will enjoy this movie equally. I can't wait for the sequels! *crosses fingers*",Serenity

Do not read spoilers this film takes you on a ride that is non stop. George Lucas needed to take some hints from Joss, this film has more power and more real characters than the new SW series had ever hoped. The characters are explored more deeply and I miss them even more now that I have seen this move, I have to say that River Tam in the series I never really thought had huge stand out performances but she sure does in this. all I can say is that you will not be disappointment.

1224,Juleshortstuff,Shiny!!,10,30 September 2005,"Right off the bat, I would like to confess that I am a Firefly fan, a Browncoat, so this review might be biased. I had just recently been introduced to this series by one of my friends who knew that I liked Alan Tudyk. Immediately, I was drawn in by this rag-tag gang of misfits, just trying to get by, like the Joe Schmoe's of outer space. Finding this series was like finding a rare gem, and it hurt knowing full well going into it that it was canceled after only a handful of episodes. This movie is everything a fan could wish for. It is a continuation of the series and more. Every gunshot, every punch, every clever retort has been magnified thousand fold onto the screen. The crew of Serenity tackles everything on a much bigger level than the series ever did. For people who are not fans of the movie, you will love it too!! I went with a Browncoat and two others that were unaware of the Firefly universe and we all loved it. Joss has done a great job of making the characters so engaging that you will fall in love with them just like all the Browncoats have. The characters are clever and relatable. The plot is fun and exciting. Overall, this is action adventure built on a cleverly told storyline. If you go into this movie with an open mind, not expecting a deep storyline and just out to to amuse yourself, Serenity will satisfy you. This movie won't win any Oscars, but it'll entertain the hell out of you. So please everyone, go see this movie! Laugh, have fun, be captivated!! And watch out for Reavers.",Serenity
1225,jamiehendersono,Ties up all the right loose ends.,9,17 March 2016,"With 'Firefly' getting canceled after just one short season, it left a bitter taste in all of our mouths. We still had so many questions left unanswered, and our favorite characters didn't get the conclusions we yearned for. I'm happy to say that Joss Whedon has knocked it out of the park once again. Some time has passed between 'Serenity' and 'Firefly', but not much has changed, and that's a good thing. We get to pick up just about where we left off, from a character point of view. As fans we had a major concern at the end of the series. The pesky Alliance was going to stop at nothing to get River. We still had no idea why. The plot of the movie centers around this notion. With that being said, River certainly doesn't overstay her welcome. Joss did an amazing job of giving each character their time in the spotlight. This movie is exactly what it needed to be. It's a goodbye, to an amazing short- lived journey. I'm going to miss these characters. Thanks for wrapping it up for us Joss.",Serenity

For those who loved the series, you wont be disappointed, for those who have never seen ""FireFly"" this is a must see. It has action, love, humor and oh yes a great plot. The effects are so good that you wont even notice them, which is the way it should be. This story is about people, this is not a film about effects (star wars). I challenge you not to become engrossed in the story and start caring about the charters, who by the way, work seamlessly together. Joss has done a masterful job of bringing FireFly to film. I am looking forward to the next.",Serenity
1227,LadyMorgaine81,This movie is amazing,10,5 October 2005,"I had unintentionally fallen into the Joss Whedon Universe(s). He's created some amazing worlds I'm happy to get lost in again and again. When Firefly came out (and I finally got around to seeing it - evil night classes...) I was delighted with it. Yet another world I had no problem believing could be. When I heard there would be a movie, I was quite happy. When a friend sent me a link to the trailer way back when, I was downright giddy. (Yes, little school-girl noises were involved... I'm sorry.)And now that I've actually gotten to see the movie - - well, I don't know if the words to describe my reactions have ever been written/spoken/defined - - but suffice it to say that I plan on returning very soon to my local theater to see it again. And probably again. And maybe another time just for even numbers.And I'm a girl who always would rather wait for the DVD.Whether you know anything of Firefly or not, go see this movie. I happily guarantee you will not regret it.",Serenity
1228,mjc3322,"Hits you, but in all the right places. *SPOILERS*",9,4 October 2005,"I'm a fan of the series, and of everything I've seen Joss Whedon do. For some, that will force them to disregard what I've got to say. And what I've got to say is simple. See the movie.At first, I wasn't sure that my fanatic devotion to the man's films was the only thing keeping me in check. But I saw the movie in a matinée show, and I can be quite sure in saying that everyone seemed to enjoy it. People laughed at all the right places, and even my wife, who'd never seen the series, teared up in all the right places.The seeming ease with which Joss Whedon creates characters has always amazed me, as has the ability to find actors who breathe life into them. The performances were solid throughout, though there are some characters who leave the film far too early for my liking. This doesn't necessarily hurt the movie (it does in fact help it), but it is a testament to the attachment that the film is able to create on a limited schedule.The action and the effects are good, but it is the characters that propel the movie through what seems to be an odd mixing of film genres, the sci-fi western. Those who have seen the series will understand more clearly the effect that a massive war had on Malcom Reynolds, the Han Solo-like captain of ship that the film takes its name from. And they will also understand the uneasy animosity between Reynolds and Inara, the 'companion' that appears seemingly out of nowhere. There are countless other examples of these 'bonuses' for ""Firefly"" in the film. For those who haven't seen the series, the only thing they'll notice is someone who has seen it laughing a little harder, or tearing up a bit faster. Whedon does raise the stakes (as he's put it in several interviews) in this film, taking from the audience as well as giving to them, and it makes the film on the whole a much more interactive, much more engaging. The audience is almost forced to care for the rag-tag underdogs, criminals in their own right, and sympathize with them. In doing so, the losses and successes of these characters are transferred to the audience.I give the movie a nine for those slight gaps mentioned above. For me, who had seen the series, the movie is easily a 10.",Serenity
1229,rilynne,"""A knock-out hit!""",10,13 October 2005,"""Serenity"" is a knock out hit!"" It's a lot like ""Star Wars"" except the fact that everyone is a bit more real. There is no difinitive ""Light and dark"" as there is in ""Star Wars"" There is just a very gray area where just about everyone stands.The death scenes were also much more realistic. For example; When Shepherd Book died, there was no thinking that he wasn't dead, or might not be all the way dead. They showed him die and didn't prolong it too much. Also; when Wash died, they made it quick and painless. They also had him die happy, when he was at the height of his career. ""He was a leaf on the wind, and we watched him soar""",Serenity

The special effects budget was very well spent, and the ship itself looked a bit more polished than in the TV series. The on screen chemistry was fantastic and the return of some of my favorite characters of all time (Jayne, Wash and Mal) was a welcome sight. I'm going to see it again tonight as its on general release! That is if our film certification office takes their finger out, for some reason the cinemas have stopped selling tickets and have all the showings on hold....",Serenity
1231,avsharpe,One of Joss Whedon's best creations,8,12 March 2014,"The film takes place in the distant future when humanity has abandoned earth after using up all of the resources and has built colonies on various planets and moons. Sometime before the film there was a devastating war between the Alliance, a united government, and the Independents (referred to as ""Browncoats"") who didn't like the way the Alliance told them how to do things.The film is a sequel to the short-lived T.V series ""Firefly"" (again made by Joss Whedon) as it takes place sometime after the series last episode. However, you don't have to of seen the show to enjoy the film.Plot Summary: The film follows the crew of a firefly-looking spaceship called Serenity, led by Captain Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds (Nathan Fillon). They discover that one of their own, River Tam (Summer Glau) is being hunted by a mysterious assassin known only as ""The Operative"" (Chiwtel Ejiofor). The Operative has been sent by the Alliance to re-capture River and bring her back to the secret facility where they were slowly conditioning her into a living weapon. However, avoiding the Operative is not the crew's only worry as they also have to run from the cannibalistic rage-monsters known as Reavers, whose origin is unknown. Or is it?As the Operative closes in on River it's become apparent that she may of accidentally learnt something while at the secret facility...something that links with the Reavers unknown origin...Something that is hidden on ""Miranda"".I like this film because it is filled with amazing and believable acting and a well written script that mixes humour with serious, dark, tones. There are stunning effects that when put together reminds you that the crew are just people trying to get by but have somehow been court up in a big secret that could change how they see the Alliance as well as one of their own.",Serenity
1232,rbarnes-4,This movie is excellent,10,24 October 2005,"As a casual observer of sci-fi movies, I found serenity to be absolutely terrific. I say 'as a casual observer' because I only tend to watch mainstream sci-fi as entertainment and don't pretend to know much about the genre. This is film is just fantastic in that it is self-aware enough never to take itself, the characters, or any key moments too seriously while presenting great characters and extremely exciting, interesting, and tense moments. I saw this movie on a whim after watching another film and being so disappointed that it was worth the additional 8 bucks to stick around -great decision. The acting is top class, the dialogue is funny and intelligent, and the plot is pretty darned good. I love sci-fi movies that don't purport to change the way I think about the world but that present interesting situations, action, and humor and allow the audience to enjoy all this without too much philosophical harassment. Fantastic all around! Just as an end note -River is amazing (you'll see when you watch for yourselves!).",Serenity
1233,austinhockeygirl,"Didn't watch series, loved movie",8,1 October 2005,"As I share my TV with some more ""girly-type"" girls, I was unable to watch any but one partial episode of Firefly. I enjoyed it, but honestly, wasn't sure what was going on. Watching Serenity, it all makes sense now. I think the movie did a great job of giving the back-story. Sometimes movies, to save time, tend to make the back-story too short--cramming all the pertinent info into a choppy and somewhat painful few minutes. Generally, I sit through the back-story knowing that it is a necessary evil with the understanding that once the ""real"" movie starts, there will have better storytelling, etc. With Serenity, the opening scene was well written (and, in my opinion, some of the best acted scenes in the movie). The move from back-story to ""present"" was fluid and comfortable. I appreciated the humor throughout the movie, and liked that the humor kept the characters from taking themselves too seriously.Overall, I wouldn't say it was the greatest, nor best acted, movie ever made, but I will say I don't regret spending my money on it, that I'm glad I spent my time watching it, and I would happily watch it again.",Serenity
1234,zackh_90,Whedon Can Never Do Wrong!,10,25 March 2014,"I started watching the Firefly series last year and just recently finished it. The 14 episodes that are longer than the actually movie are worth it! This movie is amazing because it answers lingering questions, introduces new characters and enemies and takes die hard fans for one hell of a ride, like a leaf in the wind. Although Serenity is amazing in all aspects, you will rage at points and fan boy squeal at others. If you're a fan of Stargate, Battlestar Gallatica and really anything else under the flag of ""die-hard science fiction,"" this will definitely be up your ally, corny effects, awesome one-liners and all!The reason why I like Serenity and its predecessor, Firefly, so much is because of its strong character development and story telling aspect where Whedon takes you through a universe of space cowboys and corrupt galactic governments. Serenity's main focus is on a girl named River and her involvement with a government conspiracy, leading the crew down a rabbit hole that seems almost inescapable. Seriously, it's worth it.",Serenity
1235,jimtat7,an abomination,1,15 October 2005,"One of the worst movies i have ever seen. i am shocked to see this has scored more than 3. Woeful acting, matched only by an equally woeful script. Every single line tries to be powerful, and the result is just a tedious series of crappy one-liners. The movie goes nowhere. It is a poor ripoff of movies like the matrix, Starwars, Minority Report, and eventually Dawn of the Dead. The story makes no sense and the plot goes nowhere. they make a massive detour to pick up some token Indian woman, who finishes the movie wearing a bikini. There is some crazy black man that is intent on speaking in riddles - for no reason - who believes that if he catches the crew and then kills himself that he will create a utopia (?) but then changes his mind at the very end of it all. A complete lack of characterization. Derivative, clichéd characters are here in abundance, often with cringe-worthy results. The pathetic psychic is so clichéd its not funny; she speaks slowly and vaguely, and walks around slowly staring at things, flipping into bouts of zombie destroying madness but then switching back just as quickly. It is Littered with pathetic flashbacks; and the girls psychic powers are not used at all when they are needed most, she is so token. One Character makes a complete recovery from a stab in the heart. But wait, the worst is coming up. ""reavers"". i was laughing in the cinema. ""Oh no - Reavers!"" they are basically just zombies. they are thrown into the movie and are SO derivative and poorly thought out it is not funny. Reavers are capable of constructing enormous spaceships, operating highly complicated machinery, and working together in tight battle formations... yet when they fight, they swarm in with no weapons and no tactics, killing with their bare hands and teeth. It is ridiculous. For some reason, the crew flies into Reaver planet and fights them all,(in the end there were only about 30, despite the whole planet being named 'Reaver PLanet'). As you might expect the crew end up winning a heroic battle, resulting in the typical Hollywood ending. Don't let anybody convince you to see this movie, and don't be fooled by the score - this is a terrible movie. the woeful acting and cringe-worthy script will have you feeling pity for the mentally incapacitated Man that conceived of this abomination and the equally incapacitated men and woman that agreed to fund it. Avoid at all costs, unless your the type that enjoys seeing these kind of movies for comic purposes. 1/10",Serenity

When I heard the buzz on a new possible Sci-Fi franchise I was very skeptical. But after hearing it was one of Joss Whedon's creations I was interested, mainly because of his work with Angel. To prepare myself I watch all the episodes of Firefly, even the un-aired ones, with a good friend of mine, and we absolutely fell in love with the characters, the story, the premise...just about everything.I was extremely excited to see Serenity, and I was not disappointed at all.

1238,JoeSummers202,Truly excellent.,10,21 September 2005,"Although a fan of 'Firefly' I went into this movie with an open mind as to whether it would be good or bad. And I was blown away.It was entirely epic. Without going into much detail as to not spoil the audience, from the opening and the first shot of Serenity (which was entirely awesome) until the devastating and nothing short of brilliant finale, this was one BIG DAMN MOVIE.The ship has changed, and this was my only qualm about the movie. It no longer felt like the 'Serenity' that we were used to and had grown to love, it seemed more metallic and industrial. It didn't really work for me, but the bigger budget meant they were able to build a bigger set, and so I am unable to complain.The characters we grew to love are all there; although Book, Wash and Inara all have their parts reduced (although we may see the rest of the latter's scenes on the deleted scenes on the DVD as much more was filmed for the character), Jayne got the most laughs out of the audience - and rightly so - Simon continued with the 'protective brother' act, Zoe became so much more likable than she ever was in the series (and with a bigger and more varied role), Kaylee got some of the best lines and you couldn't help but love her, River...well River! Its probably best just to watch the movie for that! And Mal turned darker and funnier as the movie went on.The special effects and stunts were AMAZING. There is one scene right at the end which will quite literally take your breath away for the sheer choreography and length, and the famous River 'bar fight scene' looks even better than it did in the trailer, and the shot of 'Serenity' emerging through the electric light field (and uh whats behind it) will make you laugh and scream at the same time.All in all: A bloody good show!",Serenity

The film was easily better than the last three Star Wars films, and one of the better movies I have seen this year. The characters were great, the fight scenes were very well choreographed, and the special effects were great as well.

It is a little confusing for people that didn't watch Firefly and the death of characters that people loved may have made people mad at Whedon. I think that the death was good for the movie. It made people jump into the movie and feel what the characters are going through. I sobbed during the movie and it made me scared for the rest of the crew. Apart from the sad parts, the movie was funny-Joss Whedon is hilarious; and it was well made-we got to see characters develop and see some past things.

By Sunday morning, he had watched the entire first season, and was impatiently waiting for the matinée to start. We were there over an hour early. Now all he talks about is hoping it comes back to TV, and he cant stop talking about it to friends, and co-workers here in Montana. It is something when my husband is willing to spend $7+ dollars to go to a movie once....let alone three or four times!!!!!! You have to see this movie. If you can, borrow someones TV series and watch those episodes first. If you can't, don't worry...you won't get lost in the movie. It just helps to have the additional inside information.... Most people stayed during the credits to discuss how much they loved it, and all were hoping to see the series come back.

Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of fx and things that explode, but that is not the reason to run out and see Serenity when it opens. It is the characters; people so far from film stereotypes, they make you care about them. Or hate them as the case may be. Joss Whedon brought his series Firefly farther than I would have thought possible. I was afraid it might be as disappointing as the X-Files movie.

Along the way, they picked up a pair of siblings who are on the run from the law. The older brother is a prodigy in the field of medicine, now serves as the ship doctor; the younger sister is a trained government psychic, who is also a trained assassin. The captain of the crew Serenity used to be a commander in the war against the government many years back, a volunteer in the rebellion against the corrupt government. After he lost the battle of Serenity Valley, the battle that determined the out come of the war, he lost his ability to believe as well. His second in command, and the other sole survivor of the battle of Serenity Valley, is loyal to her captain in what ever he decides to do. Often though, she must be the anchor that keeps his head cool. Her husband is the pilot of the ship. He seems to be very talented in his job as he was able to navigate the crew through many hazardous events. The ship's mechanic also seem to be very talented as she was able to make something that was supposed to last only a week to run for six months. Another crew member is the muscles of the crew. He loves to blow things up, shoot things down, and basically everything that involves some type of weapon. Two other people used to be on the ship before the start of the movie is a shepherd, and a companion. The shepherd is one that people go to for counsel and wisdom. He gives the crew a sense of moral and tries to keep the conscience of the ship clear. A companion is a made up occupation that is basically a Westernized version of a Japanese Geisha. She is viewed as someone with a high social status since many of her clients are high ranking officials or noblemen. When she was part of the crew, her occupation allows the ship go places they normally couldn't get to. This group of misfits comes together as more of a family than a crew to bring down a corrupt government that tries to control how humans act.",Serenity
1245,cartystrategist,Serenity's Final Truth,8,19 June 2014,"For a last hurrah director Joss Whedon's brings to the silver screen ""Serenity"" (2005) to answer a few questions from his preemptively canceled wild, western universe of ""Firefly."" An Alliance Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is hunting the escaped psychic River (Summer Glau) for secrets she may have gleaned from visiting dignitaries during her programming. No one knows what or even if any secrets exist inside her head but the Alliance is taking no chances. Caught in the fires of the search is the crew of the outlaw ship Serenity captained by Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds (Nathan Fillion). It becomes a race to escape the reach of the Alliance and see if any of River's rambling holds clues to a greater secret. ""Serenity"" seems to have an overarching theme of belief. Mal, an ex-anti-Alliance militant who still holds no love for the Alliance, is unsure what to believe in. His opposition is known as a believer, someone who believes the Alliance way is the path to ""a world without sin,"" even if he cannot live in it. He is willing to do anything to make a better tomorrow. The Operative exemplifies this by asking his targets, ""Do you know what your sin is?"" while showing consideration and regret. Mal's only goal is to keep his crew safe and his ship flying, seeing man and humanity as complete. Mal's better tomorrow is simply where all own up to their actions and for free will to run its course. ""Serenity"" is an exciting and enthralling story, well-paced and full of action and suspense. The action is well spaced and interludes are well used to set tones and move the story along. Plenty of excitement and explosions occur, and while there were no real twists in the plot, the end is not predictable within the first ten minutes of the movie. The most apparent problem with the film was character development. The characters best fleshed out are the nameless Operative, the nearly catatonic River with Mal pulling significantly further behind. Everyone else was practically glossed over. ""Serenity"" is relatively simple to understand without seeing its predecessor, but it is recommended to watch ""Firefly"" first. Overall it is highly entertaining and recommended to anyone who enjoys chases, science fiction or western movies.",Serenity

A jarring introduction puts you on edge straight away and the brilliant tension doesn't release you for a moment; this film keeps you stuck to your seat like cement never could.One thing struck me immediately about ""Serenity"": watching these characters go about their lives with each other is extremely involving. You find yourself beginning to care about what happens to them, a feeling I haven't felt in film for a long time. It takes no time to get going either: the opening 15 minutes of the film is packed with more suspense and charisma than the entirety of most others. Just watch the operative's semi-monologue in the opening and you'll see what I mean.""Serenity"" stimulates your emotions in a very bizarre way. It combines the tension inherent in action films while evoking feelings of empathy for the protagonists. And all the while it does it while making us laugh even if we want to cry, or feel afraid. The comedy is spread out and scarce enough for it to be fully valued whenever it does make an appearance.The performances are staggering throughout: each actor defines their character with all the variety and depth of somebody you might meet on the street. Understandable, given these characters have been around for years since the ""Firefly"" series, on which the film is based upon. It shows immediately that a vast degree of thought and love has gone into making them. The choice of casting is also fantastic, in that every member of the cast gels with one another. From the film's relatively small budget, it is simply amazing that they have come up with what they have. The ships look imaginative and spectacular, the battles are some of the most tense affairs seen on the silver screen. The on ground fights are magnificent too, in that you never know quite what the outcome will be, adding a new degree of suspense.One of the most surprising aspects of this film I enjoyed greatly was the soundtrack. It combines full orchestral with guitar, and the results are some of the most epic sounding pieces ever composed. You'll find yourself humming along to it hours after you've left the cinema.All things considered, ""Serenity"" is nothing short of a masterpiece. It has enough twists to keep even conspiracy theorists satisfied, and a plot that is as ambitious and tense as they come. The story is told well through the use of thorough and remarkable characters, whom we genuinely care for. The action is fast paced and brilliantly choreographed, and the special effects are as top quality as they come. This review may sound to a degree unbalanced, but I can honestly say I found no flaws in it whatsoever. This film is definitely a must see, and no matter what your taste in genre, there's something here for you.",Serenity
1247,shadowravyn-1,Still in shock,8,30 September 2005,"I'm a huge Firefly fan--I go to the cons, sing the songs, recite the lines. I didn't get to go to any of the screenings, so opening night was my first opportunity to see the movie. Believe me, whether you love the show, or haven't even heard Joss Whedon's name, you should go see this. As a movie, it's fantastic. This is not to say that it's flawless; but it is a very good film, both as a continuation of the series, and as a film in its own right.That being said, you do not walk out of the theater in the same mood you enter it. A major Event occurs about 3/4's of the way through, and it taints the rest of the film. After the Event (and you'll all know it when you see it), the rest of the film loses its impact, exactly the opposite effect of what Joss was going for. You're still emotionally reeling, and so, what is truly the climax of the film, gets stripped of a lot of its value. And that's a damned shame.Additionally, a lot of the cast does not get enough 'air' time. Instead of coming off as an earthy, sweeter-than-pie, mechanic, Kaylee comes off as being a sex-starved waif, Jayne gets far fewer moments of sheer nutball bad-@$$ than he deserves, and Wash's trademark quips are sorely lacking. Serenity is very much the ""Mal and River"" show, which is not necessarily bad, but it leaves long-time fans wanting more.Again, this movie is not without a lot of merits. The Reavers are appropriately terrifying, the dialogue is as whip-sharp as we've come to expect, and the entire movie has the proper realism to it--Serenity's universe is whole and complete, each detail being thought out before hand, and not just thrown in at the last minute. And River's fight choreography is just fantastic.Go and see it. Bring friends. Just don't expect to come out with a song and dance.Can't stop the signal, baby.",Serenity
1248,alex_parkinson,American cheese at it's shocking worst.,1,20 March 2006,"The acting is plastic and unconvincing, at very best. Now and again, the effects are partially impressive, but this does little to carry the predictable storyline. Characters are weak and uninteresting. If I was a young teen, maybe the dialogue would have had greater appeal, but I personally found it dry. The fight scenes are mildly entertaining; however, I really did not care of their outcome. If it was a rainy Sunday afternoon and there was nothing to do, perhaps I would recommend watching this. Then again, the chances are that you would get more pleasure out of raiding your DVD collection, once again, for a copy of 'Waterworld' or a film of equally poor quality. They say 'Serenity' - I say 'dread'. Ladies and gentlemen, this film 'sucks'.",Serenity
1249,kungfukitty78,Fantastic,10,2 October 2005,"Though I was only introduced to the show Firefly this year I fell swiftly and madly in love with it. The characters are rich and in depth and the storyline is finely woven together, the chemistry of the crew and the lack of distracting side characters flitting through make Firefly an awesome thing. And thankfully, all of that transcended into Serenity.The movie is absolutely fantastic. Action mixed with the perfect amount of humor from beginning to end, rich characters and a great plot make Serenity just as engrossing as the show. And I think anyone who has not watched Firefly previously will be able to follow Serenity's story with relative ease.",Serenity
1250,miketv0000,Awful,1,21 October 2005,"I walked into this movie with no prior knowledge of the plot or TV show. I am a fan of science fiction, so I thought I'd give it a try. Bad move.First and foremost -- The acting is laughable... maybe this is what they were going for, like a campy overdone cheesiness ala Starship Troopers, but I doubt it.The characters are poorly developed, as is the relationships between them. The audience is expected to love and respect the focal character River, but she has no appealing qualities and I found myself baffled as to why the crew of ragtag outlaws would risk anything for her... or her brother for that matter, the socially-awkward doctor who acts with more wood than Keanu. He is also very unlikeable. The crew has this totally cliché ""band of outlaws"" camaraderie with all the usual players, but at least their relationship makes more sense than the way River and her brother fit into the whole picture. Perhaps the TV show did a better job of establishing these relationships, but the movie should be able to stand on its own.The dialogue is equally painful, with attempts at humor that fall flat. The only half redeeming thing about the dialogue is the fact that it is written in this old-timey style, which is unintentionally funny to hear.The story is decent at best... the climactic resolution was pretty lackluster and definitely not worth what the crew goes through in order to accomplish it.Maybe this movie fits better to the people who like Buffy and similar shows, which I find equally cheesy... but hey, this is one man's opinion. Anyway, I am being quite literal when I say that I was uncomfortable watching this movie, in the same way you get uncomfortable when you see some one butcher a speech... You feel embarrassed *for* them.",Serenity
1251,drunkmunk,PERFECT (at least for those who have seen the series),7,3 October 2005,"I can only speak as one who had seen Firefly and enjoyed it. Serenity fulfilled all my expectations in what I wanted it to be, and believe me, those expectations were high.Some did not like that a little of the back story seems to have changed. If you read the comic books, you will find this back story filled in. Mal has discovered River's psychic abilities, and suspects her fighting abilities due to her gun fight in the last episode. He is taking her on missions now. Booker (the Shepherd) and Enora have both left Serenity, as they said they would at the end of Firefly.The first 10 minutes of the movie take your breath away. Imagine the first time you saw the star destroyer descending on Princess Leia's ship. It is that kind of Awe. The story slows a bit, but the climax it builds to is well worth it. Be prepared for tears, they will come. And the humor keeps you smiling through them.Please go watch Serenity. I think I would suggest seeing the series first though. Buy or borrow or download them. Then go see the movie. You will not be disappointed.",Serenity
1252,janoda9568,Brilliant,10,14 May 2006,"One of the best things to come out of TV (ever) was the Joss Whedon series ""Firefly"", on which this movie is based. Whedon somehow made a film just as appealing to rabid fans of the show as it is to people new to the entire concept. (I actually saw the movie first, and this led me to buy the DVD set of the series.) Whedon's blend of action humor, suspense, mystery and Shao Lin monk-like psychic teenager antics is perfect, as always, but as with the show, it is the characters who make this film, the tightly bonded group of misfits who somehow stumble their way honorably along through the universe. This was a troupe that loved working with each other, and hated when it ended, and it shows in both the film and the series. I think the main thing that pulled me into this story was the sense of family that comes from it, of people who do not always get along, but in the end are loyal to each other, and fight for each other when things get tough. It is something sadly missing in our world.Jeff Janoda",Serenity
1253,IntrepidCineast,Only for the already converted,3,23 December 2005,"One could argue that ""Serenity"" brings something novel to the sci-fi genre with its dualism of a high tech ""centre-civilization"" and a more primitive and rowdy ""outer-galaxy"" back country. Much have been made of this point by fans of the TV-shop the movie was based on. However, this reviewer finds that there is little merit to such a claim. There isn't this really anything intrinsically new here, something we haven't seen before. What ""Serenity"" achieves is mainly a reshuffling of plot devices from standard SF/action movies. And, oh... the acting in this movie is really beyond abysmal, Nathan Fillion is particularly unconvincing.The story in ""Serenity "" centers on... oh, you really don't need to know this bit. You will immediately feel familiarity with the story, as with only minute changes ""the story"" has been recycled in endless action movies and TV shows. Unfortunately, had there just been some humour in this movie it could have qualified for ""popcorn flick"" status.",Serenity
1254,manny-brown,Don't worry if you haven't seen the series...,9,17 October 2005,"I went into this having never seen the Firefly series on which this film is based, and i can categorically say it doesn't matter. There is enough material on offer here to string together a decent film, and i'm sure with the back-story this would have been even better.As always with Joss Whedon productions, the dialogue is where this movie really makes its mark. Each character is layered with subtext and you can tell the actors really believe in their roles. The snappy dialogue and one-liners hit the mark, and never become corny.I'm off to get the firefly boxset as we speak! :) Thoroughly recommended.",Serenity
1255,gegsuranus,Pure joy!,10,30 September 2005,"I'll admit I am a Buffy/Angel and Serenity fan, and that I was predisposed to like this movie just in gratitude to Joss Whedon for giving me Buffy during my school years. But I'm telling you, I didn't have to work hard. So rarely do you find a sci-fi/action movie that not only fills the need for adrenaline and fantasy, but is also intelligent. Humour, emotion, a real message, it's all there. Whilst watching this movie there was a moment where I felt elated that after some time I was watching something worthy of my attention. I was watching an action movie with a brain. It's possible I'm overreacting slightly, having just come out of the cinema with all my expectations exceeded. I can only say that I truly enjoyed myself, and that is why I can recommend this movie.",Serenity
1256,ivy_eyes_1_618,I love the overall feel of this movie.,10,18 December 2005,"I first found out about Firefly/Serenity from one of my friends. After watching the pilot episode, I was hooked. I love the general atmosphere of Firefly/Serenity; the witty banter, the sometimes fatalistic but mostly honorable intentions of Mal, and the unresolved tensions. It all makes great entertainment.The movie is like the show, great entertainment. The tensions that are so engaging are still present, and the action sequences are incredible. I particularly liked Rivers's fighting scenes. She knows how to kick some serious ass! Mal and Simon get into roughly 298374 arguments, Jayne wants to kill/blow things up, and (spoiler?) a few characters die.I recommend this movie to everyone, because it is very very cool.",Serenity
1257,dcntd,greatly overrated,6,5 December 2005,"I really don't understand how people could find this film so good. In my personal opinion it's an average sci-fi - it gets a few points for special effects(not that much thou, nothing groundbreaking) and there is some funny dialogue from time to time. It drops a lot with the script - the characters are dull and forgettable and you can easily guess what's going to happen. And the whole thing of constantly hopping from place to place didn't help either.Overall the movie is about the quality of Equilibrium(bearable) and certainly below eg. Minority Report(good) and Strange Days. Given that currently in the list of top sci-fi it gets the same score as such a classic as Blade Runnder, I think it's way overrated. Actually, the whole movie feels like the pilot of a TV show - this is not surprising, given that it's based on one. And not a good pilot either.",Serenity
1258,ziphonyax,The reason some fans hated it is what makes this movie so powerful.,10,1 October 2005,"MAJOR SPOILERS!!!!!!! DO NOT CONTINUE READING IF YOU HAVE YET TO WATCH SERENITY . . Many people seem to be complaining about the deaths of Book and Wash, but I think that truly did add something to the movie that most movies never touch. Most movies are just plastic props on a screen. Serenity was so powerful, for good and for ill, because and precisely because in the death of Book and Wash, the rest of the characters we love are threatened, and so come into and added quality of life, something we do not have with most movies. Our genuine fear for the rest of them in that Reaver firefight only brings them to life that much more powerfully. They can't live without the capacity to die; they can not be human if they are immortal. I *FEARED* Simon Tam's death when he got shot. (He is my favorite character.) I *laughed* so hard when Kaylee found her renewed determination for life - a scene which would have been too cheesy had it not been under the true potential that, yeah, she _could_ die in the next few minutes.Zoe's stoicism in the Reaver battle, her hard set face, could never have had the impact as if we were watching her in Serenity valley, had she been treated like so many movie characters - immortal - not to mention that from her perspective her world was ripped apart just minutes before this ugly confrontation with the Reavers.The fact is, some movies are one dimensional. Blah blah popcorn blah soda *laugh* blah *shoot* blah soda blah popcorn.Then there are the two dimensional movies, which are great entertainment. They make you laugh, they make you cry. They make you feel a part of the characters lives. But still only characters, still only two dimensions.Serenity has that third dimension. The ineffable quality of life, even though these characters are fictional. There is no way it could have had the impact that it did, without those deaths. Book's death was a sacred act on the screen, and you could see the pain in Mal's face. (Thank you Nathan Fillion for playing the role so well.) But you could also see the near torture on Book's, yet also his pride in having that last conversation with Mal and his desire to comfort his friend - and the audience by proxy. (Thank you Ron Glass for playing the role so well.) Wash's death? Did you see how HAPPY he was at the stunning success of landing Serenity while she was in so much distress? Tanaka raved about him for all the right reasons - a lesser pilot would have crashed her so badly they would have all been paste. A lesser pilot would not have been a zen like leaf on the wind. He had every right to be truly happy in that instant, and his death was so sudden and unseen that he died in that pure state of happiness. I hate that he died, but Joss did not put him down cruelly.For me the movie is epic, and I say ""What's not to love?"". The plot is brutally simple, while having so many ramifications - and I find that this type of plot is often best. This plot reinforces one of Firefly's major themes quite well (that of being against big government.) These things (which are denied by the government, natch) haunt people's dreams, they are cruel and evil barbaric hordes on the edge of space, and they were not only created by the government, they were created in an effort to reach utopia ..! Simply perfect.That's my take on it, and I am eager to watch it again and again, as I believe every viewing will give me something to take away each time. Serenity has not displaced my #1 favorite of all time, (Princess Bride, for the record), but I do have to say that it is in my top five. Every fan should watch it at least once, despite the reaction by a minority of fans who think that it did not come through .. it came through in spades.",Serenity
1259,alphadeusex,"Descent enough, unless you're a true fan",10,30 September 2005,"This is Joss Whedon's first full length motion picture. That being said, you can expect to not be completely up to par if an experienced director took the helm. However, Joss does a very fine job in the directors chair and the movie can be very enjoyable. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is not of fan of Firefly, but enjoys this genre of film. It is witty, smart, funny, serious (but not too serious), and simply enjoyable. SPOILERSHowever, if you are a fan of Firefly, be prepared for betrayal. Whedon cares more about the general audiences movie going experience than he cares about his hardcore fan base which allowed this movie to happen in the first place. His NEEDLESS deaths of Book and Wash are proof. While the death of Book his highly debatable in purpose, the fans will still mourn because we will see nothing new with Book. He was such a mysterious and interesting character, that you would analyze his every line for revelations into his past. None of that now. He's dead... and with no purpose other than to propel the story. Wash's death is even more of a betrayal. It is completely, totally, and utterly POINTLESS. His death has no visible affects on the crew, certainly no apparent long-term affects, and this is a slap in the face to the devoted Firefly fan. Whats more, Whedon killed off Wash for no other reason than to get an emotional reaction from the audience. His death is nothing more than a movie parlor trick used to generate sympathy, urgency and emotion in the audience. Wash's death is a tool. A mere tool Whedon wrote in so he could get a better review from the general audience. Firefly fans are betrayed. I wrote a much larger article on this in the forums. Needless to say, Whedon has taken my all-time favorite show and twisted it with betrayal, to the point where I no longer know if I can ever watch and enjoy the show ever again. I wish I never saw this movie.",Serenity
1260,bubbles-39,An Awesome Movie That Surprised Many and Thrilled All!,10,1 October 2005,"Serenity is an awesome movie. As a complete Joss junkie I expected it to be good. I didn't expect it be that good. For the first time all year a movie has successfully taken me out of the theater into another world. We all knew River could be dangerous. Her fight with the Reavers was wonderful. A true ""Joss"" fight where not a single punch, kick, or shot looks ""staged"". After about 30 seconds I was absolutely enthralled. With the ""Dear Buddha, I would like a pony and a plastic rocket. "" line, I knew Malcolm wasn't there to just try and help. He was there to try to win back Inara after the mistake he made with her friend. Jayne remained true to character with comments like ""Hell, I'll kill a man in a fair fight or if I think he's gonna start a fair fight or if he bothers me or if there's a woman or if I'm getting paid, mostly only when I'm getting paid."" I think Serenity remained absolutely true to form. Having just watched the Firefly season on DVD, I couldn't believe 6 months had passed. With the changes to Firefly in the last few episodes I thought it was only a couple of weeks. Considering more than 3 years had passed on our world, I couldn't believe how little the characters had changed. The biggest change to any of the characters was Book's hairdo. Somehow, Joss pulled it off with his usual grace and skill. Thanks for a wonderful movie! I can't wait to see it many more times in the theater and then buy it at midnight the day it comes out on DVD!!! An Awesome Movie That Surprised Many and Thrilled All!",Serenity
1261,cardwelj,"Fun, funny and exciting",9,6 September 2005,"I saw this movie on the second set of pre-screenings.I am a fan of both Buffy and Angel, but I am not a fan boy. I despised the last two seasons of Buffy and didn't watch that last one of Angel. Why is that important? Because I want to establish that I am not a fanboy of Joss Whedon (the creator/director of Serenity who also created Buffy and Angel). Joss can and has made major mistakes in my eyes. Luckily Serenity isn't one of them.The movie is a roller-coaster ride of action and emotion that should appeal to previous fans and first time watchers. The plot isn't hugely original, but is freshly done. The true strengths of this movie are the characters and the dialogue. The characters are all very human and believable with depth. While none of the actors are ""names"" they all give good to outstanding performances. The dialogue is witty but has true emotion.The special effects are not going to blow you away, but are more than adequate to keep the suspension of disbelief that is so important in these genre movies.While some of the context of the movie is better understood if you have seen the series (Firefly), it isn't necessary to fall in love with these characters.The biggest downside of the movie is that because it such a large ensemble cast, some characters are given little more than minor roles. Characters that much beloved by the fans, but should not be missed by those who are meeting them for the first time. (Hopefully there will be sequels to further involve them.) My rating: 9 stars. One of the most enjoyable films I have seen in years.Synopsis: Captain Malcolm Reynolds is a hardened veteran on the losing side of a galactic civil war, who now ekes out a living pulling off small crimes and transport-for-hire aboard his ship, Serenity. He leads a small, eclectic crew who are the closest thing he has left to family - squabbling, insubordinate and undyingly loyal. Mal takes on two new passengers-a young doctor and his unstable, telepathic sister, and gets much more than he bargained for. The pair are fugitives from the coalition dominating the universe, who will stop at nothing to reclaim the telepathic sister.",Serenity

I don't know about the comic or whatever it was adapted from but OH MY GOD they copied scenes from so many GOOD movies that I seriously felt like screaming in the cinema!

There are ""1""'s out there, but I like to think that ""10""'s keep us striving for more. It keeps that goal line out there so that hopefully the movie makers will see it and aim for greatness.I gave ""Serenity"" a 9 because I believe it has a lot of greatness in it. Is it perfect? No. Would I want it to be? Again no. When it comes right down to it, perfection is boring and off-putting. No one really likes it. It is the flaws that really make something memorable. What makes a great movie? Great writing? Acting? Cinematography? Special Effects? What? All I know is that, to me, ""Serenity"" was great. It moved me when few films do. It made me laugh harder than I have in a long time and it brought me equally down to tears. It had a story to tell, one that is pertinent now and will be 100 years from now. Because all in all, this movie (and the show Firefly) was not about fancy spaceships or epic battles. It wasn't about murder or intrigue or any of the other supposedly magnificent plots that Hollywood shoves down our throats on a weekly basis. It was about people. Real people, fighting to survive, fighting to do the right thing (and sometimes failing), fighting for truth, justice, and the American (and apparently Chinese) way. But it's really about people living their lives and doing the best they can, and sometimes it just isn't enough. It speaks to the average person and what we all go through.

There's honesty in the characters that has carried forth throughout the series and comes across in the movie. They are true to themselves, even if it gets their butts kicked because of it. Even the movie's villain is better than anything Lucas has put up since the original Darth Vader, and I actually found myself cheering his fate...or lack of it.

I had no need to since I've never seen the show and I'm generally not a fan of scifi. That said, a good friend of mine was excited about it being a fan of the movie's writer (he guaranteed the script would be good even though he wasn't familiar with the show either) and I'm pretty open-minded about what I see, so I went. I'm extremely thankful I did. Serenity was a great action movie, combining good fight sequences with nice, realistic looking effects. However, it's the story and the characters that really make this movie worth seeing. The script is smart, very smart, and the dialogue is even smarter. You can't help but be drawn into this movie.I've passed the word on to some friends, a few whom were reluctant to go due to the genre and all of them enjoyed this movie a great bit.

Great acting, excellent plot devices, excellent character development... I could go on and on. Fans of 'Firefly' will find very little to hate here. The production values are very high and our favorite ill-fated sci-fi western is given the grand treatment with a plot big enough to occupy a feature film, and yet just episodic enough to make a sequel logical and welcome. When the film ends, if you haven't seen 'Firefly', you'll be one of the lucky few that have more goodness to look forward to, but be forewarned, watching both the series and the movies are sure to turn you into a die-hard fan.

I finally got to sit down and watch it last night and I must say, it was a great movie. Everything I had hoped the Firefly movie would be. Tons of action and lots of the humor that had made me fall in love with the TV show. My biggest problem, I guess, is that they killed Wash and that they killed him in such a quick and thoughtless fashion. Yeah, these things happen, but it just didn't sit well with me. I don't know why Joss Whedon felt that because he's doing a movie now he had to kill off some main characters, but it really wasn't necessary. Wash and Book were two of my favorite characters on the show. I keep hoping they will make more sequels, but with those two gone I don't think it will be the same (or as fun). So, for the greatest sci-fi/action movie I've seen in years, this gets a whole-hearted 9. If I wasn't so involved with the characters and wasn't so upset to see some of them go, I'd have given it a 10, no-brainer. Regardless, here's hoping for a sequel...",Serenity
1271,pbhylemon,If Star Wars Had Been Better...,10,30 September 2005,"If Star Wars had been better, it would have been Serenity. The characters are compelling, the story is superb, and the dialog is witty and engaging. This movie is enjoyable for all ages - well, OK, maybe not really young kids. They would probably find it scary, but if their parents subjected them to Jar Jar Binks already.... But seriously, the fact that ALL the actors from the series came BACK to do this film should tell any savvy moviegoer what they need to know - Serenity rocks not only because it is a fantastic story, but also because everyone involved in the project believes in it. That kind of commitment produces a rare cinematic treat for 21st century moviegoers. So line up, buy your tickets, grab some popcorn, and enjoy the ride!",Serenity
1272,alyssa25,Excellent but by no means as good as the series,10,20 October 2005,"I am 'in love with' Firefly so there was no way that the film could compare. The more I watch the film the more I love it as I am not referring to all the differences in the series. The action in the film is amazing, i have never seen such kick ass moves actually performed by an actress as Summer. She is amazing in the way she moves. Nathan is just as god damn sexy. Grrr. For some reason he makes morality sexy. If that's possible. The only let down is the film is a bit too clean and Kaylee, although extremely adorable, isn't as adorable as she was in the show. Partly 15lbs lighter, partly not enough screen time. All in all amazing but film may loose none sci-fi Firefly fans.",Serenity
1273,mwhenman,What's the latest on a Sequel / Firefly Series 2,9,30 March 2006,"Having recently watched both the series and the film, I am absolutely stunned that Fox can cancel such a Golden Goose. They appear to promote garbage that costs next to nothing rather and attracts a fickle and unappreciative audience (cmon I know we watch it but when it's over, it's forgotten in a day...) than investing in Good quality programming that stays in the mind so much, and obviously so as this has such a phenomenal fan base attached to it. You don't see this much passion and loyalty to a channel/programme at the end of the latest series of American Idol do you ?? Surely even they can see that the credentials are in the right place, Joss Whedon needs no explanation to them surely, the ensemble cast is extraordinarily likable (I'm rather fond of Kaylee myself!!) and the stories are so well structured that you don't have to leave credibility at the door. It's utter madness!!I'm sure that you've heard this thousands of times, but I need to have a moan...sorry!",Serenity
1274,mrsjanesmith,"I've been registered here for ages and never bothered posting before, but...",9,6 September 2005,"...I just have to say how much I loved this movie. Imagine Star Wars without the clunky dialogue or certain merchandising based characters (I love the Star Wars originals, I'm talking about the prequels here). I didn't really know much about the film until a month or so ago, but I work in film and was able to get a ticket to a screening: it just blew me away, straight off. Funny, thrilling, moving. Apparently it needs to make approximately 80 million worldwide for Universal to consider sequels (which would probably be filmed back to back), so let's make that happen! I want to see more from these guys. What can I say, I'm a sucker for a good underdog story, and any cancelled cult TV show that makes it onto the big-screen as a bona-fide feature film extravaganza has to have a certain something to it. Turns out in this case that certain something is a roller-coaster story, characters you can really root for and stunning visuals. And all for $44 mil. Mr Joss Whedon, we salute you.",Serenity
1275,Catter,Awesome Movie from a Rising TV Cult Director,10,13 October 2005,"I was excited for this movie because of Joss Whedon. I did not watch Firefly, but I loved Buffy. I was interested to see how Joss did with turning one of his shows into a movie. And let me just say that seeing this movie made me want to watch the show. It has a perfect blend of humor, action, and drama. All of the characters have personality and flare, and the story is interesting, action filled, and at times sad. Summer Glau is a fresh new face and she carried her role as River Tam as well as I imagine she did on the show. Your with these characters till the very last scene and you love them the whole time.There are going to be people that might not enjoy this movie. For one I am sure there are going to be people that were fans of the show that are going to think nothing will be better than the show, I know that's how I would feel if Joss decided to do a Buffy movie. I would be worried about it not turning out as good as the show was. There are also going to be people who are not going to ""get"" Whedons humor which can be dry at times. Having watched Buffy and Angel I'm used to it and I love it. I think for me it was just so Joss Whedon. A lot of the humor and even the characters reminded me so much of Buffy that it was a joy to sit through. But this movie can also stand on its own and it has. I hope Joss continues the good work.",Serenity
1276,kevinconroy,Serenity: My Favorite Movie of 2005,10,3 October 2005,"This past weekend I saw Serenity. To put it simply, I was amazed. Rarely does a movie blend action, suspense, and science fiction so masterfully with a rich background of characters and an amusing dialog. Although not all of the plot turns were unexpected, the writers broke numerous Hollywood clichés throughout the movie, causing my jaw to hit the floor on more than one occasion. I won't do any spoilers, but I will say that the surprises they put in the movie had me captivated for two days afterwards. I plan to see it a second time in the theatres so that I can be sure to capture the full depth of the story in relation to the characters. Thus far, it is my favorite movie of 2005.If you haven't already, go buy/rent/steal Firefly and then go see Serenity.",Serenity
1277,queencria,A Raspberry in the Face of Fox Excecs,10,2 October 2005,"When I first saw the trailer for Serneity, it took my mind a few minutes to connect it to the wonderful and wonderfully abused Firefly TV show that appeared all too briefly on Fox. When the connection was made, I started dancing madly around my living room.The wonderful thing about Serenity is that it stays true to what made me fall in love with the show, all the great relationships and quips, while adding something new and extraordinary.The heroes as as fantastic as we remember them. The new villain is fascinating as a man who is trying to achieve a world without evil, while acknowledging that the majority of his action he does to achieve that world are evil. He manages to be philosophical without being boring.Without a doubt, a wonderful movie and great triumph to the Fox executives who axed it.Oh, and if you didn't watch the TV show, no worries. There were, sadly, only eleven aired episodes, and everything is established without any major questions.",Serenity
1278,coolstream11,a very great movie,10,5 October 2005,"Serenity is a great movie, no questions, you'll laugh, you'll cry (if your a fan), you'll gasp in horror (reveres are scary as hell), you'll be shocked and u will be in awe. This movie has something for everyone Now... for some spoilers and my comments there in...Wash died... and preacher died, I was sad... I more or less saw Preacher's death coming... and he died a good death, very heroic. As for wash? That was hella sad... poor guy got spiked by the reveres and Probably eaten! And Zoë... she was none to happy :( river, she kicks ass, if u watched the trailers u know that... my favorite scene in the ENTIRE movie, and all movies ever, is right after river killed all the reveres and she is standing over the big pile of body's with the bloody sword and axe, she looked like an angle IMO, granted a death angle... but still awesome.any who, you will LOVE the movie if you are a fan, everything that was awesome about the show is in the movie, you will love the movie if u like action flicks, its loaded with awesome action and bitchin effects... if you love good movies, you will like serenity the only people who seem to vote 1 are the people who have seen firefly, decided they hate it and took it out on the movie, if u don't like a show and they make a movie out of it why would u go see the movie unless all u want to do is gripe!? 10/10, serenity is my new fav movie of all time, right above boon dock saints, equilibrium, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and office space, all great movie, but serenity freaking pwns! :)",Serenity
1279,jiandpenny,Great film,10,30 September 2005,"This is my first review on any film and what a film it is. After watching fire fly the series I was an instant fan. So my expectations for serenity where very high. Now after watching serenity twice in last 36 hours, my expectations where meet and then some. Serenity does not Rely on hours of special F/X, just good story telling, great characters and a sense of humor. The story has a few surprises, which I would never have guessed. Joss Weldon writing skills for dialog are all through this film. I just hope serenity is a success at box office, so a squeal can be made. Because I believe serenity can become one of new sci-fi block buster franchise.",Serenity
1280,danielwsc,"Loved it, but the Internet spoiled this for me (my own fault)",9,1 October 2005,"If this movie had been released in April like it was supposed to be, I would have given it a 10. But all the anticipation and too-available spoilers, well, spoiled it a little for me. How I wish for the days of Star Wars, which I knew nothing about before I went, and found magical. I even managed to see The Matrix before I had seen half the movie in teasers and trailers. The next time I want to see a movie this badly, I will avoid all information like the plague.That said, Serenity deserves a solid 9. The story, dialog, and pace are excellent, and the main characters are believable and well drawn. The plot holds together very well, but it is huge and doesn't quite fit in the 2 hours; with background stories, it would have been enough to fill a 13 episode TV series.My gripes about the movie itself are the short shrift given to the minor characters, the soundtrack, and some of the camera work. The choreography and skill of Summer Glau make the fight sequences things of beauty, but the music, lighting and camera angles are flat. I know that the style of Serenity is gritty realism, so slow motion sequences with pounding rock music a la the Matrix would not fit in, but oh what a waste. Maybe they can have a featurette on the DVD.",Serenity
1281,starbuckanear,Try to think beyond this movie.,8,2 October 2005,"Joss doesn't think like the rest of us. He did not make a stand alone move, he made ""Serinity: Part One."" That is why people were killed off and that is why some characters were set to the side. In parts 2 and 3 we will see more of other characters and probably more deaths. I'll bet any of you my left nut that Zoe's pregnant and that alone is enough to see the next movie. Now to specific complaints.He made the movie he wanted to make. He made it for us, the fans, but we should have known what we were getting into. Joss is not going to make the happy movie where everything turns out okay. When given the choice between the mega-happy ending and the hard-core ending, Joss chooses the later every time. We have no one to blame for this. We knew he would do it. It was to be expected.Wash was killed because he had served his purpose. He was the pilot, but others could pilot the ship. He was the wise-cracker but others could do that job too. Mostly he and Zoe were the happy couple and that sort of thing just screams ""Kill one of these people"" to Joss. Ask a Buffy fan about Tara. I was mad as hell to see him go, but I know why he did it. This is not Star Trek. We do not lose main characters over contract disputes. Someone was going to die... you would rather it was Kaylee? He had some his part and was sacrificed. Yes, for dramatic effect. Yes to make us sad. If no one had died we would have been screaming he wussed out. I hate him for doing it, but it had to be done.Why make a stand alone movie? Because it was part of his vision. Yes he could have tied it all together but it would not have been part of his larger vision and that is what we want. We, the fans, want the trilogy. We want the series back. This was going to be part of the series. It was going to happen. It was hard to see and I still hurt from it, but that is life. Put people in dangerous situations and some will die.Did I love the movie? Yes. Did I like the movie? Not so much. I did not like how it made me feel, but I trust that the story is not over yet. There is more to tell. So keep supporting the story people. Keep supporting Joss. He is evil. I hate him too. But I trust him to give me story that is made all the better for its sacrifices.",Serenity
1282,PicklePegg,"Just what the fans ordered, but it will entertain non-browncoats!",10,10 October 2005,"After having been a devoted fan of the ill-fated TV show 'Firefly', I was delighted when the news hit that a film was to be made, and what a film!!!! it ticked all the boxes for fans, the use of the unique language and the little in-jokes that you would only understand if you had seen the TV show, but it would also delight newbie's, it is altogether a fantastic film, i'd like to call it a sci-fi film but, is so much more than that, to the point where it doesn't really fit a single genre. It makes you laugh, it's action packed, you jump in you're seats at the shocking bits, swerve as if you were on board the ship and you will cry. I mean you will really cry, even if you don't really know the characters as well as a fan would, you will cry. this is worthy of many an award, and they will be won most deservedly. I would love to just spill the beans and tell you the most shocking bits, but I can't, it is something to be seen and experienced first hand.The genius of Joss Whedon has finally made it to the big screen, a film to be seen by all! I urge you to go see it!!!",Serenity

I think it made it better than other similar series transitions to the big screen.I came out with that warm glow of contentment, mixed in with a whole host of other feelings. A little disappointment (would we ever find out who Book really was)I had laughed, been sad, a little shocked, and pleased with the pace. But overall I had been satisfied, by a ""GOOD"" film, a rare thing these days, can't wait for the DVD.I agree with the comments of the other review I read, this is a great Sci-Fi movie,which works on many levels. Go see it, it is the freshest Sci-Fi for years, and if you don't like Sci-FI go see it anyway its a great film.",Serenity
1284,DickieEasterhouse,Serenity - Loved it !!,9,7 October 2005,"I have never seen Firefly, no I'm not lying (see the message board) but I am a huge fan of the sci-fi genre and also of Buffy/Angel. I was therefore immediately predisposed to liking this film for that reason.And I wasn't disappointed. It's one of the most fun and entertaining films I've seen in many a long year.Yes the story was cheesy and been seen a million times before but the humour was spot on and the action sequences were superb. I would recommend this anyone. I do have to say though that I went with 5 other blokes. Four of us loved it and 2 hated. No one had a neutral opinion of the film. Maybe it's one of those films either love or hate with nothing in between.Cheers D",Serenity
1285,Hatman_gbw,Serenity Rocks!,10,22 October 2005,"This film really blew me away. I am a huge Star Wars fan and science fiction fan in general so when this movie hit theaters I couldn't pass it up. But in no way did I expect to like it as much as I did. I liked it so much I immediately went out a purchased the complete season of Firefly. Needless to say I have watch the complete series twice already, as well as all the bonus materials. The cast loved working on this film and Nathan Fillion even goes on to say that Firefly was best job he has ever worked on. The atmosphere and the sense of family the cast creates draws you into the movie. This is a truly new and original take on science fiction and I strongly recommend it!",Serenity
1286,imdb-7387,Fantastic!,9,6 October 2005,"I had high hopes for this, being a recent Firefly convert, and wasn't disappointed. This was a roller-coaster ride which answered many of the questions left open by the series, and raised a few more.Fans of the series will love it, and I'd guess that even those who know nothing of it will also enjoy the ride.Great story, some real shockers, and seriously funny moments. However, I can't honestly see this forcing the guys in the suits to bring Firefly back onto the small screen. From what I've seen there has been little to no promotion of this movie. At my cinema (in Brighton, England) it was shown in the smallest screen they had. Seriously, I've seen bigger TV's than that screen!It's a pity really, as it was almost full, and everyone seemed to have a great time.Anyhow, it was good to see the crew back together again, and to finally understand a bit better what happened to River in the past. Needless to say the chemistry between the cast was as exhilarating as ever. Some parts of the movie seemed to be stretched a little thin, but for the most the script, directing, acting and sets were pretty darn cool!",Serenity
1287,redleader_mdm,Sometimes the best thing to say is...,10,20 October 2005,"The one thing that struck me when watching this film (And to a lesser extent, the series) was the use of silence.Two scenes stick in my head. The scene where River is watching the television advertisement, and the scene where Inara meets our bad guy. In both of these scenes, the Director has seemingly placed faith in the acting ability of his cast to get their perspective across entirely without dialogue. Both scenes presented such a strong use of subtlety to me that I nearly broke out in applause in the cinema. The only film that has done this for me is Lord of the Rings, and even then, Joss Whedon with Serenity has mastered the delivery more than any other film or television show I've seen.Being from Australia, I find the slang and banter of the crew hard to follow. Yet, not once did my lack of ability to follow the dialogue detract from what I was watching. Throughout the entire movie the actors had such an on-screen presence that there was never any doubt what their characters were thinking or feeling.It should be said that I'm a very critical movie-goer. Yet after days of hindsight, I can fault only two things with my viewing of Serenity. Beyond that... I laughed, I cried, I jumped, and I gasped. And even though I am by no means a ""fanboy"", Serenity will rate as one of my favourite movies of all time, if only for it's brilliant direction and delivery.A work of art that the cast and crew clearly loved making.",Serenity
1288,creepatoa,Friggin excellent!,10,7 October 2005,"I am a hardcore fan of the series; I own the DVD and had most televised episodes recorded. This movie was far better than I thought it could be. It kept the qualities that made me love the series and added enough extras to make it fitting for the big screen. I particularly liked the fact that they explored the things that most intrigued me on the show, the Reavers and River. I've recommended it to everyone I know and those that have seen it said they laughed and or cried. I think that if George Lucas had made this movie and labeled it Star Wars, Episode 1 the entire world would have gone nuts and left the theater feeling like he kept the soul of that series alive. It will be a cult classic for sure, but I think anyone who sees this movie will find it on the level with any of the great space based sci-fi movies.",Serenity
1289,stuart-ohara,A good film even if you haven't seen firefly,8,14 October 2005,"I hadn't seen anything about firefly in more detail than it was Joss Wheedon and it was cancelled, however i still enjoyed the film a lot.I was given enough details at the start of the film to understand enough of the back ground to get into the film. While somethings where left hanging (why was the series firefly not serenity etc) no major holes where there for me as a newcomer to the universe.I really enjoyed the film and thought that it was one of the better films of any genre i had seen in recent times (although there where some clichéd bits but they did work and most films have some clichéd bits nowadays). Although i don't subscribe to the its best film ever school of thought i would suggest anyone that is a fan of sci-fi to see it and for others to give it a chance. You may hate it (thats your right) you may love it but most people i have spoken too who have seen it (firefly fans or not) enjoyed it. And as someone else posted isn't that why you goto a movie anyway",Serenity
1290,ebraz83,Pleasantly Surprising...,8,30 September 2005,"I didn't know what to expect going into the theater to see this movie. I had never seen ""Firefly"", the TV show that this movie is based on, but I was very pleasantly surprised with the film. I am a fan of sci fi movies and this one is unique in the latest crop of over-dramatic flicks that take themselves too seriously. It's light hearted and filled with a good amount of humor while still delivering an epic story and good action sequences. It may not perform as well as it deserves at the box office, mostly because of its roster of actors that are pretty much completely unknown to those that haven't seen the TV show, but don't let that affect your decision of whether or not to see it. It's an all around good time at the movies and I highly recommend it.",Serenity
1291,brett-187,An excellent film,9,19 October 2005,"Serenity is a marvellous mixture of Cowboy Bebop, Matrix, House of Flying Daggers and Star Wars, with a soupcon of Resident Evil thrown in for good measure! If you are expecting a serious drama, then Serenity will pass you by... the opening scene, with its wise-cracking one- liners, sets the pattern for the film. This is a cartoon with live actors. And on that level it excels, it is by turns exciting, funny, heartwarming and sad. And while much of the plot is 'action by numbers', the cast lift it into something a lot more satisfying. It is no accident that geeks have instantly recognised this to be a true successor to the Star Wars 'franchise', T-shirts with 'Joss Whedon is my new master' are now available at Thinkgeek.com. Summer Glau (River) is captivating as the damaged child, her face is as expressive as her fighting at letting us know the turmoil going on inside her. Can't wait for December for the DVD to be released.",Serenity
1292,Thomas-gamache,fast paced adventure,10,2 October 2005,"This movie was excellent. The story telling was awesome. The characters are great. But I have to say I was a Firefly fan when it first aired on Fox. The actors and actresses poured everything in the job. Joss is a brilliant writer. The movie reveal led a lot of back story in the firefly 'verse. The whole story was very unexpected. Don't wait until this comes to DVD, you'll miss the half of the effect. The ending totally blew me away. I talked about that for hours after the movie ended. The I hope they really do make another firefly I'd hate to think this was the end of the verse. This was truly a 10 star film and I can't wait to see what Joss comes up next. He is truly a talented story teller.",Serenity
1293,jCharles-Scott,"Fun, funny, and dark",10,25 August 2005,"I just saw the press screening in NYC, and I'm in awe  of Joss, of the cast, of everyone associated with the making of the film. If you're a fan of Firefly, all the crew you know and (presumably) love are back.The banter is believable; different characters have different sorts of quips and reactions. These are the same Big Dn Heroes of the TV show, but given a chance to shine on the big screen.Sex is handled much more tastefully than in the show. Apparently you can get away with showing quite a lot on network TV, things you can't show in movies and keep a PG-13 rating.Fair warning: In the Firefly DVDs, Joss mentioned wanting to ""go to a darker place"" with the show. He's done so. There are some *very* dark places.I was concerned that non-fans would not ""get"" the character interaction. No need to to worry, a newbie I brought to the screening loved the show nearly as much as me.",Serenity
1294,snoopdoggisdashiznit,i can't believe how highly this movie is rated!,5,27 October 2005,"I happen to love a good Sci-fi flick but i thought this one fell short of being worth my time much less a great movie. I've never seen Firefly but it seems to have a following of die-hard fans who are ready to overlook flat-acting, cheesy action sequences and an ending which fails to bring any sort of closure.What I'm trying to say in a nutshell is that I did not have any sympathy for any character except River whose acting ability is equivocal to Keeanu Reeves. The whole storyline feels completely contrived and patchy. Originality is scarce, and the jokes which had such potential fell flat from the actors inability to deliver them.I would give it a 5/10 but had to give it a one to correct for the ridiculously high rating it has on this site. I nearly vomited when I saw it was in the top 250! SPOILER!!!! Wow the Alliance did experiments on humans and turned them into Reavers. This is the amazing conclusion? It is treated as if this small video clip will change the fate of an entire universe leading to a complete revolution where the parliament has no power to meddle in the affairs of others and every one lives happily ever. The whole script seems completely contrived and none of the characters are developed within the movie. Perhaps Whedon is depending on the fact that everyone in the world has seen his TV show, and so doesn't bother trying to give a background on anything. As a unitiated I had no idea in which way the alliance was evil or the importance of Mr. universe or shepherd book.",Serenity
1295,Killer_Kadoogan,Excellent continuation of the Firefly 'verse,10,22 August 2005,"I was lucky enough to see a press screening of the completed movie in London, on August 10th.If you loved the Firefly TV show, (and if you have seen it chances are you do), you should love this movie.If you didn't see Firefly, then try and watch it before the movie gets it's official release. Don't worry if you don't get the time though. Joss Whedon does an excellent job of introducing newcomers to the 'verse that this story takes place in, and the characters.Don't pay attention to those who point out it is based on a failed TV show. Truth is that the Fox TV Network never gave the show a chance, barely advertising it, giving it a terrible time-slot, pre-empting it on many occasions, and showing the episodes out of order (the pilot being shown last!). The show was excellent but never stood a chance with a network that seemed to purposely want to destroy it.The movie follows the adventures of the crew of a spaceship called Serenity, and their efforts to keep one member of the crew from the clutches of the Alliance, who govern the galaxy the story takes place in. These people are not 'holier than thou' heroes, just normal people who have been forced into a situation that wasn't of their making. They aren't overly moralistic (refreshing when compared with the tired Star Trek franchise), as you will find out very near the beginning of the movie. They will do whatever it takes to get keep flying.It is difficult to say anything more about the story with being spoilerish, so I won't.Often movies are described as 'roller-coasters' when they really are anything but that. This one deserves that description. You will not want to leave the cinema for a minute as you will miss something. It's 2 hours of sheer intensity, that leaves you feeling somewhat exhausted at the end.Joss Whedon demonstrates what fans of his TV shows already know. He can write excellent dialogue, create interesting and lovable characters, have you laughing out loud one moment and leave you shell-shocked the next. This is the movie that George Lucas would love to have made, if he had the talent of Joss Whedon to write believable characters, a plot that makes sense, and great dialogue. Hopefully the movie will do well enough to gain at least one sequel. It deserves it.",Serenity

I'm not going to try to fancy this up any, I don't need to.I think people are just being harsh on it because it's fans have given it such a great review. I really don't see the problem with that. If you watched and enjoyed the series ""Firefly"" you will probably love and enjoy the movie ""Serenity"". It's really that simple.Myself? I watched the movie before I even knew about the series.

What I can tell you is this. I laughed, I gasped, I cried, and I sang praises to Joss Whedon after I left this movie. Forget the show, forget everything else you've heard, this movie had everything you can ask for. And to be honest, thats what makes lending out ""Whedonesque"" seasons out to friends so easy, Joss' shows have everything. There is no other writer who can put me into a movie or show, and make me feel every emotion I even know. It's his real life take, on amazing situations that make Joss one of the most sought out individuals in the fantasy movie business. This movie cannot disappoint you. This is my PERSONAL guarantee that you will leave this movie, AT THE LEAST, knowing you got your moneys worth, if not straight to best buy to get the season. I began this review with a sentence stating that I don't know how this movie would play to a non-fan of Firefly, and I stand by that.

I religiously watched ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"". Just recently (about two months ago) I started watching ""Firefly"". I bought the DVD without actually seeing any episodes because I trust Joss Whedon's taste. So, being completely disappointed that the show was canceled so early, I was so excited to hear about ""Serenity"".I am at the theater, in line, ready to watch ""Serenity"", already shaking and almost in tears. I get in the theater and it starts. Throughout the whole film, I was never, never disappointed! Whedon's story was character-based, along with a great story to tell. There is humor that is so witty, and events that are so tear-jerking (yes, there were tears, even to Jayne-ish men).Even if you are not a Browncoat or have never seen ""Firefly"", I do recommend ""Serenity"". There is nothing in the film that suggest that you must watch ""Firefly"" first (although, I recommend you see it). It is definitely a Sci-Fi, thriller, and dramedy all packed into one film. I promise you will not be disappointed. And you will want to see it more than once.",Serenity
1300,tiogshi,Quality film,9,18 December 2005,"I went into this movie having seen only a few of the series' episodes, but loving it already. My girlfriend is an avid Joss Whedon fan, but I'd ""neglected"" to mention this was a Whedon movie when we went in. I earned a bruise for that, but we both came out of the movie feeling great.Joss has continued to show he's a quality writer, and despite some minor changes he had to make to the background and events of some of the 'verse to make it more movie-compatible, he carried forth the Firefly ideals and style perfectly.One thing I miss from the series was the casual use of Chinese in the character's speech, usually for exclamation or cursing, but I understand why this was dropped, and while I don't like the direction two characters were took, I understand it wasn't Joss' fault (it was at the actor's request).The quality of the movie itself was superb. Special effects were done exactly to the extent they should have been, and the directing was dead-on. Style, cinematography, and simple fun were not sacrificed for anything; not budget, not ease of editing, nothing. The story itself was clear and well-told, and Joss has still managed to leave just enough loose ends to carry on to a restart of the series, or another movie.9 of 10, with a single point off because no-one bothers reading a 10-of-10 review; you know it'll be overly biased.",Serenity
1301,hvymetal,This is one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever!,9,12 October 2005,"This movie was an extraordinary Sci-Fi Thriller! From the opening to the end credits, I remained deeply interested (unlike some COUGH STAR WARS 1,2 & 3 COUGH). The movie had that great righting where it takes on serious issues and makes them quirky and funny, Which turned this movie from something like War of the Worlds, where everything is extremely dreary and everyone and their mom dies, to something more along the lines of a feel good comedy with action sequences. Joss Whedon did do some unforgivable things that most brown coats will be angered for, but the movie still came across very well. The characters were almost the exact same from the show, and the special effects were spectacular. Another upside to any fans out there is the increased action sequences, which i have been urning for, ever since i saw the first show. Overall a very good movie and even if you haven't seen the show or aren't a sci-fi fan you will be entertained for the entire length of the movie!",Serenity
1302,mr-rawin,"Serenity Is Sci-Fi enough for Sci-Fi fans, but not enough to throw non-fans off.",10,25 March 2006,"First of all, I have never liked Sci-fi, apart from your regular ""futuristic"" film that comes along like The Matrix, or Equilibrium. But Star Trek, Star Wars, all those considered ""Sci-fi"" classics have always turned me off.But when I saw the trailers for Serenity last summer, it grabbed me by the neck, and I couldn't pull away. From the trailers, It seemed like any sci-fi movie, but what caught my attention was the use of a different mix of elements. The trailer all at once seemed serious, and then funny, and then scary.I fell in love with the movie. No spoilers here, but like the synopsis on the back of the DVD, I can tell you that a crew (almost like a family) on a ship called Serenity are running from a galaxy-dominating government called the Alliance, and also from savage Reavers that are almost zombie or orc-like. For those reluctant to watch it, because (like me) you don't like sci-fi much, you should know that this isn't your typical sci-fi movie. There are no aliens. There are no ""Forces."" The most sci-fi aspect about it is that it takes place in space, 500 years in the future. The story could very well fit into a present-day setting, or even a historical one, if you change the space-ships into water-ships, and instead of planets, you've got countries or islands. The movie itself has a little bit of a Western feel (the show it was based on called ""Firefly"" had a lot of Western in it, though watching the show is not necessary to understand the movie ""Serenity,"") as well as some horror elements, and witty humour enough to remind you that you're supposed to be enjoying the movie. It would be enjoyable enough without the humour, the story is amazing and well-written, but the humour is like icing on a cake: It's not slapped in your face like a cream pie, but it's there, and subtle, and melts in your mouth.So give it a chance even if sci-fi isn't usually your cup of tea. The story's told incredibly. The actors are wonderful. The action is great, as well as the effects, though I have to tell you... this is a story-driven movie. Don't expect any 20-minute action sequences. And there aren't any 8-eyed aliens to distract you.",Serenity
1303,hynoskij,Just Amazing,10,22 August 2005,"I was lucky enough to catch one of the pre-screenings of Serenity in Spring (thank you Universal!). I let the cinema with a lump in my throat and a feeling that I had just witnessed something special. A phoenix from the ashes, if you will. Serenity is simply an emotional roller-coaster, especially given its ilk in the sci fi genre. Joss has truly created something special for the fans of the show, and for fans of clever storytelling. The movie is an analogy of the show as a whole and can best be summed up by the infamous quote from Mal in the TV series, ""We've done the impossible, and that makes us mighty."" See. This. Film. Watch Firely first if you want to get the maximum effect.",Serenity
1304,Gordon-Bleu,"A treat for ALL film fans, not only devotees of SF",9,5 September 2005,"After suffering through six years of mind-numbing Star Wars movies, ""Serenity"" is a refreshing delight. Witty, heartfelt, and well-acted, with impressive special effects that serve the story rather than fill the screen with so much visual gibberish, Joss Whedon's creation is not only great science fiction, but also just plain excellent film-making.""Serenity"", unlike so many other movies (whether sci-fi or otherwise), takes place in a world that has been thoroughly thought out and comprehensively designed, and which draws you in to speculate about what may be happening beyond the frame of both the picture and the story. The characters do not merely perform narrative tasks but have fully formed histories and motivations, as well as their share of flaws to help keep things interesting. The story is a masterful blend of humour, romance, adventure, and genuine danger. And to boot, there's a truly top-notch villain.In short, you don't need to be a fan of the series, or even of science fiction, to enjoy this film. You just have to love good movies.",Serenity
1305,younga01,Sci-Fi's Savior,10,2 October 2005,"This was quite honestly up there with my favorite all-time sci-fi movies, on par with the best of Star Wars and Star Trek 2. I believe that Joss Whedon has created the next big franchise. Remember back when Star Trek (the original one) first went off and the outpouring from the fans that continued for years after until Paramount decided to make a film, thanks in part to Star Wars. It was much the same way for fans of Firefly, but obviously it didn't take as long for them to get what they want.It is not uncommon to kill off a loved character, in this one, we lost two. But it just added to the story as a whole. You got to see a complete different side of Mal when Shepherd died. When Wash died, it was just a shock, and if you didn't think that there was no one immune from dying, you weren't paying attention. The only complaint I have is that we weren't able to see how Shepard went down.Agree or Disagree with my points, it was an extremely well-written movie. I hope they make a sequel, and I hope they get to making it soon.",Serenity
1306,sonia_m_bailey,Intelligent Sci Fi!,10,10 October 2005,"I love this film! It made me laugh, cry, jump out of my seat in amazement. Joss Whedon has crafted a masterpiece here which doesn't fail to check all the boxes - flawed, human, good guys, an almost angelically evil bad guy, breath taking sets and backgrounds and an attention to detail which shows this was a real labour of love. It's great to see a movie which really engages the viewers intelligence - sci fi doesn't have to be brylcreemed good guys firing lasers and monotonous bad guys. You can't help but love all the characters, even when they are doing wrong. They seem to integrate into a seamless whole even when their personalities seem to be pretty incompatible. Joss Whedon's skill as a storyteller shines through when you see how all the characters have new facets which are revealed as the film progresses, bringing a surprise in every scene. Even when something happens which is predictable you are made to feel as though you were meant to predict by understanding the characters involved. One of the best things about the film was the way all the characters were introduced for those who hadn't seen Firefly, in a way which wasn't annoying for those of us who have. A great movie, Mr Whedon you are a genius!",Serenity
1307,evinrudebg,Left movie feeling disappointed.,5,2 October 2005,"My husband and I have been Firefly fans since the first episode aired. We have the DVDs and have watched them again and again. We were SO EXCITED to see the movie ""Serenity"" that my husband took the afternoon off work so we could see the first showing in our area.It was a great movie except for two things: 1. The handling of two characters. Especially the second character. Those who attended the movie will know what I mean. I will be searching the 'net to find out why certain things were done. 2. The storyline placed too much emphasis on River Tam.I am also curious as to why the Alliance would suddenly let River go. As a psychic, she must have learned other damaging Alliance secrets besides Miranda.My husband and I left the movie feeling disappointed and depressed--the same way we felt after leaving the second Star Trek movie. We wish we had never seen the movie.",Serenity
1308,durtschid,Terrible...Just Terrible,1,8 February 2006,"NO SPOILERS!!! I can't say anything good about Serenity. The acting is horrible; even for a late night TV show on the SCIFI channel, this would be bad. The plot is very weak. I won't spoil it, but anyone with half a brain will guess it within 20 min. None of the actors were believable in their roles, especially the main characters. The special effects were good, but I think in the year 2006 you need more than sweet cgi space battles to be a good scifi movie.I guess this is where I diverge from most of the scifi nuts of the modern day. I am a classic scifi (Star Trek, Star Wars, Dune, etc.) man, and I just don't like the new stuff that is coming out. I have the scifi channel at home, so if I want to watch stupid slapstick space soap operas, I can watch it all day for free. If you like Firefly you will like this, because they are both crappy, cgi based scifi with no acting, no plot, and no surprises. The good guys are invincible, and have everything figured out (except the incredibly simple obvious plot, for which they are completely clueless).I have to say I was very disappointed. For as high a rating as this got, not to mention being the 2005 Tomato Award Winner for scifi, it was pretty weak. I guess 2005 was a BAD YEAR for scifi.",Serenity
1309,Afecks,Firefly got canceled for a reason,1,7 October 2005,"I give Serenity a 6 out of 10. Let me explain why. I deducted a point for the fact that this guy made Buffy and Angel. I can never forgive him for making annoying shows that my wife forces me to watch whenever she can.Another point is deducted for the fact that the ""hero"" was a jerk and only cared about himself above all other people. That's not a good hero. He killed a guy just to save his own skin. How am I supposed to care about him and hope he saves the day when I hate him? Then at the end he has a sudden change of heart for no apparent reason. Too little too late.Another point is deducted for the HUGE plot holes. Those Reavers are raving lunatics yet they can fly complex spaceships? Riiiiiight....Yet another point is deducted for all the tired plot devices they used, unstoppable brutal aliens (Stargate Atlantis), trying to get an important message out to the people (Johnny Mnemonic), seemingly fragile yet powerful girl (Fifth Element), the list goes on and on... I don't see how anyone can say this movie is original. The only original part was the added mix of humor. That is the only redeeming quality.The film did have decent special effects and overall the story was good and fluid. I wouldn't say this movie is a B movie but it's definitely not an A.

This movie is undeniably amazing and is constantly surprising me with hidden gems each time I watch it. The only reason why I wish this movie hadn't been made is so we could have kept the series going to dole out the treasure trove of amazing stories which were teased in the series and to learn more and more about each character's back-story as the series progressed. To have it all revealed in one movie is almost disrespectful to the genius of Joss Whedon.By the way, what is the story with Book? We never find out, do we?",Serenity
1311,mikejdom,Wow,10,10 October 2005,This has to be one of the top 5 Sci-fi movies of all time. I put this on par with the original Star Wars trilogy and well above anything to come out of Hollywood in recent years. I cannot stress enough the quality of this film. The writing is top-notch and the acting is superb. I can't imagine anything that could have made this film better. Oh wait... I can... all of you. The only thing I'm disappointed in is the lack of turn-out and the somewhat lackluster box office numbers. Come on. Where are all the fans? What happened to the promises of multiple viewings? The numbers aren't there... which could mean that this film is the last we'll see of this wonderful ensemble. That would be tragic. My hope is that Fox will see the error of its way and rekindle the series on TV. Here's hoping. You can't take the sky from me!,Serenity

River is one of the most complex and interesting characters on television. The mystery of her mind draws you into the story further and further. Wash and Zoey are the strong centre of love and marriage, while the rest of the crew flirts with the ideas of love. Inara and Mal's relationship needs to continue to be developed (for which reason I continue to hope that there will be a serenity 2, or even better, firefly back on the air!)

1314,theskanman,Can't stop the signal.,10,2 October 2005,"Having seen every episode of Firefly, I had an expectation for this movie; there were things that I wanted to see, and I was determined not to like the movie unless I saw them. However, like another favorite filmmaker of mine, Paul Haggis, Joss Whedon is a master of manipulation - from the first minute of the movie, you're drawn into this world of science-fiction and intrigue. The movie was not what I expected - it was better.Given the fact that the movie's cast is made up of relative unknowns, they do an excellent job of bringing Joss Whedon's words to life. Nathan Fillon shines as Captain Mal Reynolds, a veteran of a war long-past whose sole interest is the lives of his crew. The distinctive sets, the rip-roaring action pieces, and the menacing adversary all set the tone of the movie as it quite literally hurtles through two hours. I did not think so much time had gone by, watching this film, and that is most definitely a good thing.In short, I felt for this movie, this crew, everything that I wanted to feel for the new Star Wars trilogy. I had been left feeling a bit disappointed by the terrible science fiction prevalent in the theaters, but this movie changed my mind. I'm going to go see it again, very soon, and I urge you to do the same.",Serenity
1315,Bmacklem,Just saw Serenity,10,30 September 2005,"I just got back from seeing the movie, and I have to say that I *have* seen the series and also was a fan of Wheadons other TV series' (I'd call it a guilty pleasure watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer), and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie. It had all the elements of the series that made it special, the dialogue, the humor, the action, and the character driven elements. There are a few minor/major points that fans of the show may have liked to see better/different/or were just plain unexpected, but anyone who knows Wheadons work will understand the way things tend to go in his visions, not always the way you think they are headed. I'd say if you didn't like the trailer, and didn't like any of his previous work, then give this one a shot to see if maybe a really well done movie can give you a couple of hours of enjoyment. If nothing else, see it and make your own opinion of it without taking anyone elses word for it....you have a brain and an opinion of your own...use them, but see it instead of just taking my or anyone elses word for it.",Serenity

That there is danger involved and not the ALIEN type. That the government may just come calling and not with flowers.This is what gives Serenity an energy that I just haven't seen in mainstream sci-fi films for years. Whedon's humorous dialogue mixed with a suspenseful plot makes for a really fun ride.Its almost a shame that the River and Reaver (Hey, just noticed THAT coincidental homonym) origins are tied up as I would love to see more of this universe from Whedon. I enjoyed every second of the movie but was kind of sad when he killed off the funniest character.Whedon's track record hasn't always been perfect but he really hit one out of the park with his directorial debut. Long story short... this was a great and fun movie. Congratulations, Joss.",Serenity
1317,james_stuart,Pleasant surprise,10,3 October 2005,"I had never heard of Firefly, which was unusual given I was such a Next Gen, Deep Space & Voyager fan. Although I had never seen the original TV series, I could tell - mainly by the positive reaction of the audience - that this was a movie many had indeed come to see after having fallen in love with the series. The treatment of the film adaptation was such that I could easily identify with the characters, and yet the mystery of it all remained. Great story line, excellent (and well-spoken) arch villain, and a genuine tension. Bravo. By now, you'll have guessed that I thought this movie was nothing short of excellent. It was one of those movie cinema experiences where time stood still for 2 hours and I forgot where I was. That to me is the sign of success for any movie, in any genre. I will most likely buy the Firefly series on eBay now.I truly hope the producer/director team continues with a couple more adventures on the big-screen.Regards, Stuart agent00funk@yahoo.com.au Sydney, Australia",Serenity

I felt no desire to watch more of the show, but I saw the movie regardless. I'll admit, at first I wasn't completely into it, but about a third of the way through I found myself unable to look away and not wanting to blink. The camera angles were unique. The dialog was clever and witty, encouraging frequent positive audience reaction. I wouldn't call it ""funny"" despite what I've heard some say, but a small amount of humor effectively lightened the mood, an unnecessary but appreciated relief. I found the plot easy to follow, which isn't something I expected, and it wasn't overly simple. Those who say the show in its entirety will have a greater appreciation for the movie, but I can guarantee everyone will like it.",Serenity
1319,linuxisgreat,"Excellent film, highly recommended",10,30 September 2005,"I am a fan of the TV show, and was expecting great things from this film. It has vastly exceeded these expectations.The writing has the typical Joss Wheadon flair to it, with a driving, intense plot line interspersed with witty humour. The characters are also well developed, and they evolve convincingly.What particularly struck me about this film was the breathtaking cinematography. After seeing this film, Wheadon's style seems so much better in film than television; in the latter, the small screen space and tight production times seem to cut in on what otherwise is a beautiful combination of dark lighting and long cuts.As a final note, I quite enjoyed the soundtrack. It is atypical, not being the usual orchestrated track, but rather backed mostly by acoustic guitar, adding to the western mood of the film.Overall, I was very impressed with this adaptation of a good TV show to an excellent film.",Serenity

I enjoyed it more than Episodes I,II,III and I think it is on par with IV,V,VI. Great characters define this movie. The plot is rather straight forward (this is not a bad thing), but the characters make you care about what is happening. Life is usually straight forward, but the characters you meet along the way make it more interesting. It is that ""real feel"" that makes this movie great.If you see the TV series ""Firefly"" first you will enjoy this movie more, but it stands alone very well.

Not one decent actor, scene, effect or moment of dialogue - admittedly the dialogue does have some mildly amusing and very dry humour at times but if I wanted that I would buy a copy of Viz.All in all I am so stunned by the general reaction by the IMDb-ers that I will not bother to believe in the reviews that get left here any more as they have ceased to be reliable.Now I know that enjoying a movie is all about taste and that is a totally subjective area, but for a movie to get 8.3/10 from over 20,000 voters you would expect something at least above rotten 'b' movie standard.Well this movie, along with Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants (just PANTS for short!) and Donnie ""What The Hell Was The Point In That"" Darko have been such a deeply felt let down that my trust in the overall IMDb opinion has gone and, like I said, I will not be using it as a pointer to great movies any longer.The IMDb is dead...Long live the IMDb",Serenity
1322,martyleicht,"A misplaced gem, guaranteed to garner more fans as time goes by.",10,6 August 2006,"As a screenwriter and ardent fan of the Firefly series, I was fearing a letdown as a result of trying to condense a multi-season story arc into a two hour feature film. I was relieved and delighted with the results, thank goodness, and though its tone was considerably different from the TV series, it was still, pound for pound, the most enjoyable sci-fi film I've seen in years, maybe decades. It doesn't quite rank with the original Star Wars Trilogy, perhaps, but it blows away the ill-advised prequels, and it is a great deal stronger than the entertaining but ultimately pedestrian Star Trek features.More important, though, is the broad appeal the movie has. While it obviously didn't make much noise at the box office, I have been delighted to find that everyone I spoke to who HAD seen it (only a handful of whom I strong-armed into going) enjoyed it a lot more than they had anticipated. Folks that normally don't go for the whole ""nerdy space thing"" were asking me pointed questions about the characters' back stories and where they could get their hands on the DVDs. Art film snobs, action adventure nuts, and the whole spectrum in between; everyone had a good time for the two hours they sat in the theater. For this reason, I really feel the film will continue to grow a following for years to come. Whether we get a continuation of the series or not, many years from now, this trim little adventure will be well established as a classic in the genre. Cheers, Mr. Whedon!",Serenity
1323,UKCougar,Gorram shiny,9,29 August 2005,"A long time ago in a galaxy far far away... erm, no; three years ago, in a continent a couple of thousand miles away, Joss Whedon (best known as the guy who gave us Buffy the Vampire Slayer) created a sci-fi show called ""Firefly"" which crept onto US television and ran for a dozen episodes before being abruptly cancelled by the network. Despite being cancelled, Firefly gained a large fan base and won quite a few awards.Serenity is a Firefly movie, and picks up the story six months after the end of series. Set 500 years in our future, on the edges of a universe where recently colonised planets are more Wild West Frontier than moralistic Star Trek high-technology, galactic-civil-war veteran turned spaceship captain Malcolm Reynolds and his small rag-tag crew are trying to eke out a living through whatever means they can. Often that means petty crime or smuggling, bending the laws and staying below the radar of the superpower government Alliance.In Firefly we saw Mal offer passage to a doctor (Simon) and his sick sister (River) and quickly found that all was not as it seemed with them. Simon had rescued River from an institution where she was subjected to all manner of torturous experiments, and now in Serenity those people want her back. To this end, they dispatch a cold, calculating bounty-hunter type known only as ""The Operative"" to hunt down River before the secrets locked in her brain can be discovered.All pretty standard fare so far, but nothing's ever that straight-forward in the Serenity 'verse. River herself is mentally unstable; before the experiments she was intellectually brilliant, now she drifts between brilliance, insanity and out-and-out psychosis. Despite Simon's insistence that she's ""just a little girl"", she's patently much more than that.The ship herself, the ""Serenity"" of the film's title, is in disrepair. We're not talking some huge intergalactic cruiser here, more Millennium Falcon. Serenity is tiny and getting a little battered, most likely due to lack of finances rather than any failure on the part of her instinctive mechanic, Kaylee, or her expert pilot Wash.Then there's the Reavers. Believed to be once-human and now just blood-lusting psychopaths driven insane on the edges of space, Reavers are stuff of legends and campfire stories, the film's boogymen. As second-in-command Zoe says in Firefly when asked what would happen if they got caught by Reavers, ""they'll rape us to death, eat our flesh, and sew our skin into their clothing. And if we're very, very lucky, they'll do it in that order."" The Reavers don't care who River is, other than maybe lunch.Serenity is a sometimes dark, action-packed movie, a generation ahead of other Whedon-crafted TV shows such as Buffy. Yet it has a lot of the qualities that made Buffy popular; it's a great imaginative story expertly scripted, has very involved and complex three-dimensional characters, explosive action, and has witty dialogue and tense drama in spades. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be shocked, sometimes all at the same time.Whilst the effects in Firefly were nothing short of spectacular, Serenity raises the bar. She's had a bit of a kicking but the film incarnation of the Serenity ship is breathtaking, beautifully realised for the big screen.The visual style and direction just oozes with attention to detail (though hell, the whole film does). What would be ""set pieces"" in other films flow effortlessly through Serenity - there's no ""right, now we'll have a fight scene"" mentality, everything fits together seamlessly as Joss continually pulls the rug from under our protagonists and from under us viewers.The soundtrack is spot on too - it almost, but not quite, steals the 'most effective use of music in a movie ever' crown from the moment in Natural Born Killers where Woody Harrelson grabs that shotgun. (-: For the fans of Firefly, we already have a dozen hours of backstory and already know and love the characters. Having said that, the film does stand alone in its own right and knowledge of Firefly isn't necessary or expected. Everything is explained to people who are coming to Serenity cold, but of of course you'll get more from the movie if you know a little more about the 'verse to start with. What Serenity *isn't* is just another feature-length episode of a TV show (*coughs*X-files). This, my friends, is The Good Stuff.Personally, I found it hard to find fault with the film. I loved it as you can probably tell, but I was a fan of Firefly to start with and so it's harder for me to look at it objectively. On the flipside though, being a fan I also had higher expectations of the film than your average movie-goer would, and so would probably be overly critical if it wasn't up to scratch.If I were to find fault at all, it would be because I'm coming from Firefly. Serenity's maybe over-simplified in places, with a couple of the characters underplayed or their interplay reduced, though I can see why this was necessary. A show with nine principal characters in addition to the Big Bad enemies would be hard-pressed to do everyone justice in under two hours. But hey, that's what sequels are for. (-: We were lucky enough to snag tickets for Serenity's world premiere (no mean feat in itself as it sold out within minutes, demand for tickets jamming their phone lines solid and crashing the website in the process). At the end of the showing the film received a standing ovation from the 500-or-so people in the auditorium. From an audience who are likely to be of a similar mind to myself in so far as they'd also have very high expectations, this probably speaks more about the calibre of the movie than I can express in a few paragraphs here. So go see it.You can't stop the signal.",Serenity

The series was and is one on the best shows made (it's the genius of Joss Whedon! Come on!), between the depth of characters acting, writing, film style and story concepts you cant ask for more! Give it a shot and I know you'll like it! Come on when's the last time you saw a good western style future based show with actually good acting? :)And on another note you will find yourself learning and speaking another language without even realizing it!",Serenity
1325,s-andy,Terrible Movie. It was no better than a TV show,1,8 October 2005,"No reason given as to why we should care about the plot. Characters never gave a compelling reason why that should help this crazy psycho chic. Everyone knew she was crazy yet the captain risks his crew's life for this unknown girl. No compelling reason why Captain would even risk this since he is just a brigand, established early in the movie. The crazy psycho girl is a terrible actress and fails to make you care about her plight. The FX and music are no better than what you find on the movie of the week. Everything looks staged. It fails to transport to another location or time. And there are holes in logic in this movie. It felt like the characters knew a lot more than they were letting on. It seems like a lot ended up on the cutting room floor. The big crazy enemies made no sense as a cohesive community, the big bad evil empire really didn't seem that bad, and the characters seemed to knew each other more deeply but was not explained during the movie, and character deaths made no sense (purely for shock value).The movie did not live up to the hype. Save money for DVD rental.",Serenity
1326,sirtng,The start of a new franchise,8,29 September 2005,"Went into this movie with low expectations knowing nothing about the TV show it's based on and in fact not even knowing it was based on a TV show. I found the setting of the film quit enjoyable basically a western in space, the captains gun even reminded me of an old school pistol that you would have seen round the early 1900's. The story line was quite linier and easy to follow with all the main players in the film sussed out with in the first 15 minutes, from start to finish their was hardly a minute not spent advancing the story or showing off some top notch fight scenes. Even one of my pet hates in film's didn't faze me, that been females that fight in hand to hand combat and whoop ass, with the way River's fighting abilities are explained and the style in which she fights was handled it didn't lower my sense of belief to the slightest. My gripe's with the film would have to be the special effects which I didn't find particularly good and only par with you average science fiction TV series and the Acting which while good for the most part and quite passable in any action film was a lacking in some of the more dramatic scenes required by the actors but 100% on the resent trio of Star Wars Films.",Serenity
1327,doldiboldi,Why?,10,10 October 2005,Why this is not a massive commercial success is beyond me. Like the results of the 2004 presidential election I just don't understand the country I live in anymore. This movie was very entertaining and FUNNY this is the first movie I have ever seen that made me laugh out loud and make me yell in a theater. I recommend you give it a shot you wont be disappointed. If you like good dialog with great characters and a good storyline this is a movie for you. If you thought any of the new star wars films were worth anything than you should see serenity 100 times because thats how much better it is compared to those films. Just to recap. Funny + Great Chars + Good story = Serenity,Serenity
1328,drwillis_1988,Redeems the SF genre,10,26 December 2005,"Serenity, and its genesis - Firefly - offer up a superlative mix of character development, unique visual and musical storytelling, and real-world situations that immediately convert a viewer into a participant. I have yet to see any other SF movie that can compare to its ability to focus on story instead of special effect. This is essential since most action/SF movies ignore the viewers intelligence, aiming instead for the lowest common denominators of entertainment - flash, boom, bang with forgettable one-liners.Actually watching the movie both inspired and depressed. The fact that such a great combination of cast and crew were able to construct a wonderful 'verse for fans to enjoy was humbling and gratifying. Yet the idea that (again) insufficient marketing and word-of-mouth may doom Joss Whedon's creation from an oh-so-deserved future really distresses me.Bottom line - move over Star Wars and Star Trek. Here is the series that fans of intelligent, engaging stories deserve - be they SF fans or those interested in superior entertainment of any genre. Here is a movie that is truly a must see. Once you do, you'll be a browncoat forever.",Serenity
1329,zymurgea,Till I found Serenity...,10,3 October 2005,"A year ago, I was introduced to the series via the DVD box set and watched them in their proper sequence. As with any TV show reincarnated to Big Screen, I was a bit leery as to how Firefly would transcend into Serenity. However, I was delighted to see it not only made the jump keeping the original cast, but keeping the humor and cohesiveness that unfortunately Buffy the Vampire Slayer lacked from season to season on TV.By and large, the action and acting kept true to Firefly. There were a couple of drawbacks, as I had wish Sheppard Book's character was further explored. Yet the few times he was on screen, his contributions added to the story. The other would be a spoiler, yet I was disappointed that not everyone came out unscathed. Serenity is a delight and I would give it 4.9 of 5 for a good bruised forearm movie (where you date grabs your arm during a good fight or suspense scene).It would be wonderful if UPN or Sci-Fi network continues where the movie ends.",Serenity
1330,mrevil666,Better than that other Sci-Fi flick that was out in May,9,22 October 2005,"To be honest, I only caught one episode of Firefly when it was on Fox (I worked most Friday nights and couldn't watch it if I wanted to) When Sci-Fi started airing the reruns I caught the first 3 episodes. So that's really all I know of the series....4 episodes. I think you could get through this movie by just seeing the pilot. All you really need to know is who the players are, and why they're doing what they're doing. This film does it's best to not rely on the series to fill in the gaps. So that's the first major like of this movie. Next, the special effects maintain the look of the series and still give you that big budget Hollywood feeling when you see them. Words cannot express how ecstatic I was to see all of the original cast reprising their roles from the show without ANY changes to their attitudes or behaviors. The only thing I can say I disliked about the movie...that I'll have to wait for Joss Whedon's next installment! As the T-shirt says, ""Joss Whedon is my master now!"" Now if you excuse me, I have to go watch my new Firefly DVDs.",Serenity
1331,matthewbland,Serenity is UK's no.1 Film,10,11 October 2005,"I'd never saw the TV series ""Firefly"", until two weeks ago when Sci-Fi showed all the episodes back to back. I was hooked! Then I saw the movie and truly enjoyed every minute of it. It was great to see something different in a sci-fi. An action-adventure where right up until the end you think the bad guys are going to win. The SFX were great, the humour of the movie was perfect and the story was full of twists throughout. US TV Networks take note: You cancelled this show before its time. Now its a box-office hit. I think you guys should pick up that phone and give old Joss a ring because we want more!",Serenity
1332,wmauer,I've seen Serenity and .......,9,22 August 2005,"it's great. Not perfect (and I'm not talking about the missing effects/music/etc.).There's lots of action, same great dialogue, and all things that made the show excellent.However, it does suffer from having a large cast of characters. It's not that you don't see everybody (they all have a part to play), but non-fans of the show may be thinking, ""Who is this person(s), and why are they important?"". You can't dedicate enough screen time to everyone in order for audience members to fully understand why Mal and Inara have all this tension, and how did Kaylee become attracted to the Doctor, etc.? Of course for show fans, it feels like putting on real comfortable shoes. Feels very nice.It is going to require a leap of faith on the part of non-fans, but if audiences stick with it, they can enjoy it very much, and get to see something completely original and fun.",Serenity
1333,saratoons,An amazing space western for the true Next Generation,9,4 September 2005,"I was lucky enough to see the final, complete, as-far-as-we-know-it-is-finished version at Comic Con in San Diego. I never saw the show on television, but got hooked after the series was released on DVD.While I recommend that everyone see a bit of the series prior to watching the movie, it isn't necessary. You'll miss some of the details, and your attachment to the characters won't be as strong so when Bad Things Happen, you'll probably wonder why the audience is crying.However, THIS is the 'Wagon Train in Space' that Star Trek was originally pitched as. This is a wonderful, high-speed space western. The writing is tight, with Joss Whedon's style of black humor woven through-out. I think this may be the pinnacle of his achievements so far, and I sincerely hope he is allowed to make either a) more episodes for SciFi Channel, or b) another movie, because there are obviously a lot more stories that can be told.But for a stand-alone movie, I rate this as one of my favorite space movies of all time. Wow. It has been weeks since I saw it, and I've still got weeks to go before its regular release, and I cannot wait to see it again. I rarely say I want to see a movie in the theater, twice, at today's prices, but this one is worth it. So much better than anything else *cough*starwars*cough* that has come out recently.I'm not saying a single thing about the story, because you can find out the rough idea from previews and the viral marketing campaigns, as well as the series itself. No details from me! The secrets are safe! ;)The only reason I give this a 9 instead of a 10 is simply due to the fact that, as I said, non-fans may be a little lost at times. Other than that... Serenity rocks!",Serenity
1334,pkn281,Better than expected.,7,6 March 2006,"I bought this on a whim. I enjoy Sci-Fi, but really didn't expect this to be remarkable. While Star Wars it's not, it's at least as good as any Star Trek NG movie I own. I was pleasantly surprised that an ensemble of names that I have never heard of could put together a movie this good (I mistakenly assumed that Adam Baldwin was related to the others, by the way). I think I will hear of the actors and actresses in movies to come. I think if the studio ever decides on a sequel, it can only get better. If you like Star Trek movies and shows, this is definitely worth a serious look. If the only sci-fi you have ever seen is the Star Wars movies ,you will probably be disappointed.",Serenity
1335,nyteshade-2,The next gen sci-fi group,10,1 October 2005,"I have heard a lot about this group and this is my first time actually seeing them. I felt the movie had a strong plot and a strong group of actors. All in all the movie continues to leave an impression that each part was well thought out. In cases where the cgi wasn't as good as it could have been, you noticed that there wasn't a strong emphasis on the cgi to the point that it didn't matter. Usually when the CGI is bad the film seems to continually focus on it to the point that you wonder if the those who made the movie actually watched it before its release. Not so with this one. When it was bad it was there to serve its purpose and nothing more. When it was good it was good. Enough said.The same goes with the dialog, The Chinese wasn't strongly pushed and it was never subtitled, something I feel added to the movie but it always persisted giving the modern world a decidedly Asian touch. Whenever the dialog got sappy it was always remedied with comedy and served to suit both male and female audiences. I kept looking for something to make it bad but in the end could find nothing. I completely enjoyed the film and highly recommend it.",Serenity
1336,therices4,What an amazing piece of cinema!,10,2 October 2005,"Words cannot express how much I enjoyed this movie, as a Firefly fan, I do not believe that Joss Whedon and the cast of Serenity could have done anything better! When I left the theater, I felt elated. If you are a fan, watch it! If you have not watched the series, go see the movie and when your appetite is whetted, go get the series and watch it too! I truly believe that Joss Whedon is a genius and I hope and pray that not only will we get the Serenity trilogy that he has talked about, but also that some Network exec will have enough testicular fortitude to put Firefly back on the air! I feel that the crew of Serenity is like a family and that I would give anything to be a part of that family. The movie is packed with action, but also delves deeper into the characters, Mal especially, it lets you see a darker side of Mal than the series portrayed. There are a few shocks that set you back and some moments that make you want to stand up and cheer. Thank you Serenity! Dong Ma?",Serenity
1337,shadowslance,The return of our big damn heroes!,10,30 September 2005,"I have just returned from seeing Serenity twice (yes 2 times!) and I must admit that the second time around was even better than the first.If you are unfamiliar with Firefly, I suggest that you run out to your local retailer or favorite online merchant and purchase it at once. The movie will be that much better knowing all that the crew of Serenity has gone through before this movie.That being said you do NOT have to have seen the series Firefly to enjoy Serenity. The writing is excellent and the story imaginative. Granted there are a few lines in the movie that are dripping with cheesiness but that makes the movie that much better.Don't miss out on this movie or pass it up simply because it came out of a cancelled TV show. TV execs don't know what they are missing and I sincerely hope that they soon will know what they could have had!",Serenity
1338,riverreaver,Serenity rocked my summer world,10,23 August 2005,"Serenity review for IMDbI drove five hours to see an advanced screening of Serenity in late June. I was pretty much blown away. So, I'm already biased in Whedon's favor, but hey. The man can't do much wrong. :) Did I mention I am biased? Joss Whedon is a Champion of TV storytelling and comics, and now has his chance to shine REALLY BIG!!! If you loved or really liked Firefly, you will probably have much more love for the series after you've seen the movie. In short, it ROCKS! Serenity looks just like Firefly, but way bigger and way better than any one episode could possibly be. It does not at all look or feel like a large TV episode. Way too much goes on for Serenity to fall into this trap.The action pretty much starts during the opening credits, and doesn't begin to slow down until the closing credits. I didn't move from my seat once and neither did anyone else in the theater -- again, a bunch of rabid fans in attendance, but I had no problem leaving Ep III and War of the Worlds for anything. A few things. Each time. I saw them after Serenity and they looked nice on the surface but had very boring scripts. *yawn* Serenity reviews after the movie release will probably focus on how the film grabs your attention and refuses to let go until the final credits roll, unlike many disappointing releases this summer. All with one-quarter the standard ""summer blockbuster"" budget! There are awesome special effects of course, but the story is character driven first and foremost, so FX in every frame aren't necessary to make up for a crappy script. There is no crappy script to be found.You will get: The usual Whedon cocktail of seamlessly woven action, adventure, creepiness, drama, comedy, romance... get it? This film is Whedon's first big screen SHINY star. It has a look and feel I've never before seen on the big screen because, well duh! I finally realized, It's JOSS WHEDON doing his thing up there! He's invented his own genre -- a patchwork quilt of genres, all in one. When it's funny, you really do laugh out loud. When it's dramatic, you watch wide-eyed and in silence. When the action is in high gear, you get cramps in your neck and shoulders and arms because you can't calm down. Yup. Just when you think it's safe to breathe, Joss surprises you again. And again. And River? She's my favorite new girl. Ever.As for the PG13 rating, it's understandable and appropriate. There will be no ""it should have been PG, it should have been R"" debates. PG13 is just right. It's not a film for small children. A few scenes would definitely be too scary, and there is lots of shooting. In another effort not to spoil, I won't comment on any romance that may or may not happen. :) I understand Whedon and his works. Many in the mainstream audience will not. However, if audiences are interested enough to sit down and see the film, at worst they will probably leave the theater glad they met the crew. If you think it's boring, you're probably a robot. The significance of some characters/actions/diaglogue may be lost on some non-Firefly fans, but this will likely pique their interest instead of discouraging it. You can totally understand the movie if you haven't seen the series, it's written that way. For the sake of time, the who-does-what-and-why is efficient and there is no boring exposition to explain things. Whedon has that great-writer gift. He shows it to you instead of telling it.The movie is unlike the Firefly series in that you can't have nine main characters and a spaceship the center of a 90 minute movie. Some characters have more limited roles than others, but all the Firefly cast certainly has their chances to glow. And they do. Do you have favorites? They'll mean more to you after you see Serenity. They look just like the movie stars they are and several will undoubtedly find they have no more privacy after this movie has been consumed by mainstream audiences. Serenity will be a tough sell for Universal, and they are conducting a brilliant new marketing strategy to generate pre-release buzz. Firefly is now being rebroadcast on SciFi Friday nights preceding the usual lineup (hey! Now I like the new Battlestar Galactica!) and their plan seems to be working. Universal is gathering new fans as I type, before the movie's late Sept. release. I predict Firefly DVD sales will reach a new peak a few weeks after the movie's release as well.I can't guarantee you'll love it. If you can get around ""space western"" sounding like a really dumb idea, check it out. I missed out on several years of awesome television because Buffy the Vampire Slayer sounded silly. Sadly, I finally realized it does sound silly. It's meant to. It's the first joke in the story. And what a story. Firefly, the ""space opera"" or ""space western"" as it's often referred to, sounds just as odd. It is a tad odd. Because it's original. Unique. In some (but not all) ways, unprecedented. Joss Whedon has reinvented television, once again, and with Serenity you can see him reinvent film. That man is going many, many places.Serenity is film bliss. Check it out, or be sorry you waited when you finally do. It's about that simple for 98% of those who will see it. It's a rare little nugget the studios don't usually offer. Cheers!",Serenity
1339,nerdia,Will definitely see it again and again and again...,9,5 September 2005,"Saw this movie at a press screening earlier this month and it was truly a shocking roller-coaster ride (in a good and fun way). Having watched the Firefly series on DVD I already knew the characters however I tried to watch this movie from a non-Firefly-fan perspective (at least as much as I could). The movie does a very good job at portraying the characters and their interaction with each other as well as a fairly decent job at providing the viewer with a good description of their surroundings as we saw them on the TV series. Of course, this is a motion picture and in no way does it deceive you into becoming a soap opera. There is plenty of action to last you a very long time...some have said maybe too much which is probably the only less positive comment I would have to give. That just means I'll have to go see it again to make sure I didn't miss a thing. But that's okay with me cause I love riding roller coasters!",Serenity
1340,masterzora,From a Firefly n00b...,10,12 October 2005,"I went with a small group last night to see Serenity. Only one member of the group (not me) had actually seen Firefly and she hated it (while we were waiting for the rest of the group to show up she told me that she ""didn't come to see a sub-par movie with *you*""). As one can imagine, she had low expectations for this movie, but the rest of us were actually expecting quality.The easiest way to describe it is that only one of the entire group left the theatre with a different opinion than when we went in. The unanimous opinion of our group was that the movie rocked. The character development was astounding, far beyond anything I expected. Joss Whedon showed a mastery in writing that I have not seen for a while. Humor, action, development, romance, and the like were well fleshed out and well timed. I will be quoting Serenity for a long time, I am certain.For the first time in a while, I would be willing to pay $7 to see this again. For the first time ever, I would gladly do it alone if nobody would join me.",Serenity
1341,songstress42,the best sci-fi show I've seen so far.,10,28 December 2005,"Just before this came out on video, a friend of mine introduced me to the TV show Firefly from which this movie originated. i suppose that does make me somewhat biased, but regardless this was has definitely been the best sci-fi show i have ever seen, and I am a very big fan of the sci-fi/fantasy genre.What makes this movie so good is the gentle way the writers, director and cast have blended the futuristic element so seamlessly into their actions. far too often in sci-fi movies does the futuristic or magical element get in the way. the key to doing the future right is to treat it as if it were part of everyday life. the audience will relate to it more if the characters seem comfortable and natural in the world they are living in.Also, the subtle comedy that is added in and the sense of humor of the cast is so good! it's everything I had hoped The hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy could have been. This movie was so good that it could have been set in modern day and it would still have worked. That in my mind is good sci-fi.*Spoilers beware* the only thing I did not like was the death of the pilot and loving husband of Zoe, Wash. He was in all truthfulness my favorite character and for him to have to die was awful (although i can see how they thought they had to do it). also how the relationship between Mal and Inuara was brought into the light and yet left unresolved. *here end the spoilers*All in all I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I recommend it to anyone who likes sci-fi, action/ adventure, or to laugh.",Serenity
1342,stoppedmotion,In a few short words...,10,3 October 2005,"Simply phenomenal and that's a phrase I don't say lightly. The back story has been compressed into about ten minutes of fantastic story telling giving even a non-fan, someone who has never seen the show enough information to enjoy the story laid out before them. I found the pacing of the story to be tight and intriguing, moving the story along at a brisk pace. To be frank, the movie was over before I realized and had a satisfying ending. There will be many fans of the show who will be calling Joss Whedon a bastard or worse for what happens to some of the characters because we are that connected with the characters in the story.Over all, it's a good yarn that entertained me twice and will likely entertain me again long before it hits the video store shelves. And really, be entertaining is what it is all about.Using my scale of box office value, I will gladly buy a few more full price tickets to go see it.",Serenity
1343,manosdvd,Extraordinary,10,17 August 2005,"The others do a good job gushing about the movie. Sure we're fans and bound to like the movie more than the usual fare, but those looking for an original and thrilling movie experience, this will shock and amaze. The Firefly world introduced a fantasy home for many of us, with characters we truly cared about and dilemmas we could get behind. The best way to describe it is to take the best aspects of the Han Solo elements of the original Star Wars, and build a world around that. There's no grand theme or clear cut good and evil. There's just a band of fugitives trying to make their way in a dangerous sky. It's something folks can relate to, although most of us won't be in a space battle or fighting psychotic creatures anytime soon. The point of the name Serenity is the name of the ship, though in a deeper sense that's what our characters are in search of. Finding freedom and a home, and that's what the ship represents to them, and to the fans. So you understand why so many are so excited about this dinky little scifi flick. The movie captures that beautiful feeling but takes us on a ride that there's no turning back from. In my opinion, the one thing that makes for a truly GREAT movie is if you walk out of the theater a different person than when you walked in. This movie takes you on such a journey I didn't know if I would leave the theater at all. Sure the visual effects are stunning, but even the unfinished effects I saw meant nothing to me because it was the characters I cared about (and note that the digitally created ship itself is one of them, and I cared just as much for that than any of them). The humor is probably better than anything in the theaters this year, and the action is even greater. My screening actually came a week after Episode 3 was released, and I immediately washed my hands of Mr Lucas, and months later when I saw Fantastic 4... well let's not even talk about that one.This movie really does have something for everyone, and even in the core of the geek fandom, the range of people is total - men and women split it at least 50/50, uber-geeks and ""cool"" types, and a surprising amount of attractive people of all ages. Seriously though, don't trust the rants of the fans. Check out the movie for yourself. Give it an honest chance and I promise you will be taken on a journey that will turn you into a fan as well.",Serenity
1344,djs-20,Scifi at its very best.,9,2 October 2005,"I waited all year for a scifi film that didn't leave me feeling at least partially empty (Hitch Hikers Guide, War of the Worlds, and let's not forget the best of the prequel trilogy of let-downs Star Wars ep.3) Enter Serenity. Definitely the best Scifi movie I've seen this year (and probably for several years). A successful blend of the scifi and western genres. Features an ensemble cast with hardly a ""star"" to their credit (yet). Somehow Joss Whedon manages to write characters that are real and multi-dimensional, and I mean that about virtually every member of that ensemble I mentioned earlier. Lets talk about cast chemistry. The fact that all original TV show cast members are back for the film is evident. They've made a movie that didn't rely on the big explosions and the constant shoot-em-up (""as-if"") formula to keep the audience's attention. Don't misunderstand me, there are several eye candy scenes, but they all play nicely and unforced into the cogent story-line without detracting from the relationships of our characters. The result is a real roller-coaster ride of emotions from characters that I genuinely came to care something about, this movie has given me renewed hope that Hollywood can produce intelligent science fiction movies w/o spending hundreds of millions or hiring the biggest stars. It is everything I wanted SW3 to be. A truly wonderful movie going experience, and worth every penny of the ticket price.",Serenity
1345,orphea,Best movie I've seen this year,10,2 October 2005,"I love Whedon's television writing, but I was nervous about how he'd shape his vision on the big screen in a very limited amount of time (compared to the long season arcs he's used to). I saw SERENITY and all fears vanished. The guy is a master storyteller, apparently in ANY medium; he manages to pack all sorts of deeper and more complex thematic elements into what, on the surface, views as a really fun ride. One gets the feeling upon leaving the theater that one just saw something extraordinary as well as entertaining. It's only after a few hours, a few talks with friends, or maybe another viewing or two, that you'll start feeling the reverberations of the movie. It won't ""fade to black"" like most other movies do.I'm seeing this again as soon as I get paid and I look forward to buying it on DVD. It's a movie that rewards multiple viewings, just as my favorite books reward many readings.Go see this movie.",Serenity
1346,jmkelly03,Oustanding adaptation,10,20 August 2005,"Instead of going into a long, drawn out review, let me sum up ""Serenity"" by saying that 1) no fans of ""Firefly"" will be disappointed, and 2) Whedon does a good enough job laying out the backstory that newbies to the Firefly universe will have no trouble figuring things out and enjoying the heck out of the movie.The film is split more into halves than the standard three acts, which works just fine in this instance. The plot may be confusing at first, but when the second half of the film starts there are no lingering questions and a pantload of great action bits and one-liners. Frankly, the last 45 minutes are absolutely outstanding. The first half takes a bit to really pick up, but it's the second half of the movie that will leave old fans and new yearning for a sequel.There are some sad moments, some gut busting lines, and some rousing actions sequences that make ""Serenity"" a wonderful film that really, really deserves a sequel and, perhaps if we're lucky, a second chance on Sci-Fi.",Serenity
1347,pennypinchers-1,Serenity Rocks,10,30 September 2005,"Serenity is without a doubt the best movie of the year! From beginning to end, it's a roller-coaster ride of action, heroes, villains and explosions! It keeps you on the edge of your seat from the moment it comes on the screen. The dialog is sharp, witty and fun! Whether you have ever seen an episode of Firefly or not, makes no difference. You will love this movie. Some people have stated Serenity is the new Star Wars only better! I agree 100%! Joss Whedon was destined to make this film and, if we are very lucky, more of them to follow. The characters are engaging, and despite time constraints you feel as if you know these characters well. Nathan Fillion as Malcolm Reynolds brings strength and depth to the leader of this band of outlaws. The entire cast is amazing! Truly a must-see movie if there ever was one.",Serenity
1348,lee-moore4,"Serenity, Preview showing, London, Aug 2005.",10,25 August 2005,"I was lucky enough to get a ticket to a special preview showing in London of Serenity. I cant say I was a massive fan of the TV show, it took me a long while to really get into it. Once viewed I was really looking forward to seeing the movie, through word of mouth I had heard it was a damn fine film. Now having seen it I can confirm it is the most satisfying movie I have seen this year. Everything about this movie is enjoyable from the effects to the script to the action. This movie doesn't disappoint... no spoilers here, just go see it when it opens.. A Massive bonus was a 30 minute Q&A with Joss Whedon and Summer Glau who were both very engaging and funny..",Serenity

Anyone who's seen even a fragment of anything Joss has put together before can immediately recognize his style, his trademark. The strong characters, the witty dialogue, the almost painful transitions from drama to humor to horror and always the return to humor, all adds up to a pure Joss encounter. My sister got me hooked on Angel and from there it was Buffy and then Firefly. Many hard earned dollars spent on DVD collections later, I was a tried and true fan. I went into this movie expecting to love it and my expectations ended up being kicked to the curb. Love? I'm bordering on ""criminally punishable adoration"". This movie is a breath of fresh air after a summer of fetid smog. It takes the sci-fi genre and spins it until it's dizzy and puking on a barroom's sawdust floor. This movie goes to show you that CGI and crazy mad FX don't a good movie make. It's the character driven script that creates legends.",Serenity
1350,sarah-quail,I'm more excited about its release now than I was before seeing it.,9,22 August 2005,"I was lucky enough to see Serenity at an early August preview screening. I'd been tracking production progress and reading interviews ever since I first heard it was coming out, and the night before I went to see it, I didn't sleep.And after having seen it, I'm *more* excited about its release than I was before. It was well-paced, the character's stories were explored, the explosions were pretty and some hilarious new characters were introduced.One thing I really enjoyed- throughout the series the Alliance can be seen as a rather sinister force, and Serenity reinforces this view- delving into conspiracies within the government.There were some differences between the series and the movie, at least in the cut that I saw. The characters themselves weren't changed, but some of the backstory was altered slightly. However, Serenity is a stand-alone movie and I felt that it worked better as a movie with the changes... they improved the pacing of the movie.",Serenity
1351,missmegz,A great movie for every one.,10,22 August 2005,"Whilst based on the Firefly series it's a movie that can be enjoyed by those who have never seen the series as well as fans. Set 500 years in the future, the movie, like the series, centers around the crew of a Firefly Class space ship called Serenity. The ship's Captain Mal Reynolds along with the first mate, Zoe, fought on the side of the Browncoats (The Independants) in the Galaxy war, which was lost to the Alliance, who now rule the Galaxy. The crew of Serenity survive from profit made from petty theft committed whilst on the run from the Alliance. From the moment Serenity starts playing it's non-stop action until the end. Full of witty dialogue, exciting action and wonderful characters this movie will be enjoyed by everyone. For lovers of the series, Reavers are back, and meaner than ever. Many of the old loved characters are back with a few new ones thrown in. Many questions fans were left with at the end of the series are answered. Just when you think there can't be any more trick's up Joss Whedon's sleeve, he shocks you again. Serenity combines the pace and explosions of an action movie, with the wit and laughs of a comedy, whilst being set in a futuristic Galaxy with characters that you can't help but love.",Serenity

People have asked me what this film is like and all I can tell them is it's hard to explain but worth every penny to go see it. It's not sci fi, but it is. It's not a western, but it is. The list goes on and on. I walked out of this movie completely satisfied. I have seen a lot of movies in my time on this earth. Believe me. This movie immediately goes in to the top 5. Maybe top 3. As for the breakdown, here it is. The dialog was some of the smartest I've ever heard. The cinematography was incredible. The music was moving and exciting and definitely something you probably haven't heard before. The characters all shine and the casting couldn't have been better. Just go see it. Now. Really.

All of the trademark intelligence, wit, humor, action, and drama from the excellent TV series elevated to a more epic scale with non-stop pacing. I think I forgot to breathe a few times during the movie, especially in the thrilling climax during the last 10-15 minutes. I was a huge fan of Firefly, so I'm biased, but two newbies I took with me also thought it was a very good movie, and they wanted to see it again! Nathan Fillion *is* the next Harrison Ford, and his character Captain Reynolds is Han Solo with fewer scruples -- and he *does* shoot first!!!",Serenity

I was one of the lucky ones, I was able to get the tickets. It then cost me over $400 to travel to Toronto and stay in a hotel on the day of the movie. Everybody I know thought I was crazy to spend that kind of money to see a movie. But, when I got to see it, even unfinished it was worth every penny! Joss Whedon knows how to spin a remarkable tale, with wonderful characters, poignant funny dialogue, and some wicked special effects. Without giving anything away, there are battle scenes that will quite literally have you on the edge of your seat. The cast is remarkable. They all reprise their roles with flair. To Joss Whedon, Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Morena Baccarin, Jewel Staite, Alan Tudyk, Adam Baldwin, Summer Glau, Sean Maher, Ron Glass, all the production staff, and Universal Studios, all I can say is THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!!!",Serenity
1356,jcprice-2,Worth watching a few times,10,23 August 2005,"I saw the preview version of the film a couple of weeks ago and was blown away. I walked out of the cinema and immediately wanted to watch it again - an experience I've not had since Lord of the Rings (all of them).Better yet, I'm off to see the final print tonight. It will be interesting to see what's changed.One thing I like about movies is how they can capture the imagination with the extended universe that is implied. This has a tendency to induce repeat viewing and inspire speculation about the nature of the extended universe. It's something that I've most experienced with Star Wars (as a child), and later with Alien and the first Matrix film. Hopefully I can add Serenity to this list.Do yourself a favour. Watch this film.",Serenity
1357,fishdogtwo,Fantastic,10,4 October 2005,"This is by far the best movie I've seen in at least two years. That being said, it does have some rough edges that are easy too look past. I thought the story was very compelling, and the back story for the original TV show that the movie was based on was very clever and cohesive. The cg was very good and not overbearing like some other recent sci-fi movie. The characters drive the story and they drive it fast and furious. I think non-fans of the show will be able to follow the movie and enjoy it with the rest of the browncoats. That being said, why are in still sitting in front of the computer, reading this, when you could be seeing it for yourself?",Serenity
1358,chris-mcquillan,The finest picture to grace cinema screens this decade.,9,23 August 2005,"For his big-screen debut, Joss Whedon doesn't fail to impress in either of his roles of Writer or Director. The story is fantastically paced and well written to ensure the audience doesn't get lost. Not only does Whedon manage to provide closure for the show in a heart-tugging and effective way, he also manages to leave the door open for a sequel (but not in one of those painfully blatantly obvious ways). He answers many fan prayers by exploring the Reavers in great depth, providing plenty of character development and generally making it great fun. Laughs are plenty (though the movie is much, much darker than the show was).From a directing standpoint, the movie was a success. The action scenes are sharp, and well-shot. The movie has so many different types of action to convey, from shootouts, to swordfights, to space battles to your regular beat-em-up. All work perfectly on screen, and the sharp and unexpected cuts get more than a few jumps from the audience.The acting is simply fantastic. For a movie with no ""big-names"", and being an unusually large ensemble, the characters are portrayed exceptionally well. Nathan Fillion provides a very strong lead to the crew, Summer Glau plays River with grace and fantastic skill and Chiwetel Ejiofer is simply stunning as the villainous Operative.The music too is sheer quality. Many of the Western elements from the show remain here (moreso than the actual movie) with carefully crafted compositions and instrumental styles unheard of in modern action movies.Serenity is a creative success. It is intelligent, sharp, witty and visually spectacular. I can only hope the movie will perform strongly at the box office, but no matter how well its does - it deserves even more. Serenity is the movie the Star Wars prequels could only hope to be.Rating: *****",Serenity
1359,jm-109,Great!!!,10,23 August 2005,"I saw this film at a screening in San Francisco on June 23rd. Best movie ever made.But not just that. It's the best comedy. The best drama. The best tragedy. The best western (not the motel.) The best science fiction. It has the best writing and the most wonderful characters and acting I've ever seen. I actually found myself spontaneously clapping at a certain point during the movie, and I have never done that before! It has truly raised the bar on film making. Every other movie I have ever seen falls short of this one. See it on the big screen.And if you want the most incredible experience possible, buy, rent or borrow the Firefly DVDs and watch them in order before you see Serenity. Oh, and stay away from spoilers too!To Universal: I will probably go see this movie 3 more times when you release it at the end of September, but if you release it in Digital Projection, and IMAX I will go 10 more times and buy tickets for all my friends and family as well.To Joss Whedon, the Cast, and Crew all I have to say is: Thank you for this incredible experience and Oscars to you all!",Serenity
1360,imdb-9087,Wow,10,4 October 2005,"I already liked the series, so perhaps I was predisposed to like the movie. Or perhaps this is one of the best movies made in years. At almost every scene I found myself thinking ""Wow - this is a really GREAT movie!"" The way the characters and background were introduced was brilliantly concise and even helped move the story forward. Often when I see movies made from a series or book I'm disappointed and left with the feeling that the director wasn't willing or courageous enough to 'go all the way' with the story. Not so here - the movie is complete. I never say I ""love"" a movie, but when the ending credits rolled at the end of Serenity, I have to say I LOVED this one.",Serenity

The last movie I bothered to see in the theatre was Star Wars III and there was no comparison: Serenity's graphics budget didn't quite get the same visual effects but then you didn't really notice either. Serenity was so much better in terms of plot, fun and interesting characters, etc. It made George Lucas' movie look like something written by an 8-year old. Not that I generally like to dismiss one artist's work vs. another but Joss Whedon and Serenity is just so much better.Go see it for laughs and a good time. It'll be great on DVD too I'm sure but it's one that's worth seeing on the big screen.",Serenity

Now I'm both, and this film is Mighty! I don't recall ever feeling as though I've gained a family with whom I've shared such depth in a two hour stint in a theater seat. The characters are so diverse (but they all have the same slang), and you learn their quirks so quickly, that when you realize that you've been given a universe that echoes a scenario for the superpowers that would likely remain to the outer reaches, you're wondering how you ever 'got' all that so painlessly !? And the story line is one that, while intertwined with another, more hidden one, is so clearly written of a human misunderstanding and tampering where none should go (but would), that it's easy to imagine such a thing taking place in the not so distant future among us!Am I not making a whole lot of sense to you?

1363,squashedkoala,fantastic,10,3 October 2005,"Great movie. Just great.I'm very pleased with how well the TV show to movie conversion was done, and to be honest I had my expectations pretty low because of that. Joss did an amazing job.There was some excellent work done in showing a transformation of characters. I really appreciated that. There was some slight personality changes from who we knew the characters to be in the show and what we saw in the movie, but it was done very well.The humour was fantastic, it was like an entire seasons worth of one liners crammed into a two hour movie, and none of it was over the top. It was all very true to the characters and story.I suggest people watch the show before they see the movie, as some things that happen in the movie would sort of spoil the show, but either way you will have a great time and enjoy both.I met my cousin in the mall today and asked if he had see the movie yet, and he said he had just started to watch the show the week before. It's really awesome to see how much this show has caught on and the impact it has made on the world. If people knew about the show when it had aired, it would not have met the same fate that it did.

Real on the edge of your seat action with top class acting and realistic, lovable characters. And to top it all off, incredibly funny! If you've ever laughed at anything on Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Angel then this is the movie for you. Serenity would be classed as an action sci-fi, but it's so much more than that. Joss Whedon's fantastic script makes everything seem that much more real. If you hate sci-fi then don't worry. Yes there are spaceships, but you can imagine a natural evolution to serenity's ships from our own technology just now. There's no faster than light speeds and no bumpy headed aliens. This is real life people in extraordinary circumstances and the plot is very character driven. If you are a sci-fi fan, then don't worry about a lack of the usual sci-fi elements. There's still plenty of space battles! Go see it! Then force all your friends to see it!",Serenity

1368,robertamcnair,Serenity Now! Irony and Pity in Space,10,2 October 2005,"No one can claim that Joss Whedon doesn't have a vision. Whether it's a vision of a demon world existing cheek by jowl with our oblivious own (Buffy and Angel) or a future that takes trickle-down economics and right-wing morality to their extreme but logical conclusion (Serenity's Alliance), Whedon challenges his audience's perceptions of right and wrong with intriguing characters and complex situations.Firefly spacecraft Serenity's crew of outcasts don't fit in the Alliance's clean, clear world view. Captain Malcolm Reynolds fought on the losing side in the rebellion against the Alliance, and first mate (and Mal's former corporal) Zoe's loyalty to Mal binds her to him and the ship. And if pilot Wash wants to be with his wife, Zoe, he has to be part of the crew. Mechanic Kaylee loves the ship Serenity first, but she knows that Mal and Serenity are inseparable. Love Serenity, love Mal. Strongarm Jayne's loyalty used to be for sale and may be again in the future, but for now Serenity is home and Mal is his Captain. None of them has a place in the Alliance's definition of society, so they live their lives skirting it and Alliance trouble.Alliance trouble is exactly what Serenity's passengers River and Simon Tam bring with them, however. Simon has rescued his sister River from an Alliance laboratory that has been tapping into her brilliant, psychic mind to see what kind of weapon they can make out of her, damaging her grievously in the process. Medical doctor Simon and River travel on Serenity, but Mal keeps them on board with increasing reluctance, especially since the Alliance has put not just a price on their heads but has now, as this story begins, sent an indomitable Operative to retrieve River. Two of those loyal to Serenity are Shepherd Book and the Companion, Inara, accepted by the Alliance but uncomfortable with its constrictions.Whedon isn't a ""message"" writer, because that implies a heavy hand. Whedon instead sets up a problem that may or not be resolved, because he knows that in the ""real"" world, good doesn't automatically prevail over evil, and even if it does, the cost is very high. For the crew of Serenity to protect River, they must put their safety, liberty, and lives in jeopardy, not only from the Operative but from River herself, who has been taught to be a killing machine. To defy the Alliance, it's not just the crew who can be punished but, just as in our own lives, there are costs paid by others just for knowing and helping those who rebel against the status quo. For Whedon to take heady philosophical premises and turn them into rip-roaring science-fiction adventure is a natural accomplishment to those who have seen and appreciated the Buffyverse but seldom seen in Sci-Fi actioners today. If you want to turn your mind off and simply enjoy the fights, chases, explosions, and crashes, you can probably do it and do it happily with Serenity. But for those of us who want something more than the relative black and white of a Lucas world, Serenity's complexity, depth, difficult choices, and ethical challenges combine beautifully with nonstop action and three-dimensional characters for a film experience that can leave you satisfied while still wanting more.",Serenity
1369,darcylizzie,Well done!,9,6 October 2005,"I saw just a couple of episodes of Joss Wedon's short lived 'Firefly', back in 2002, and barely remembered having seen it when I started watching 'Serenity'. But as I went along with the ride, I recognized all the little things that made 'Firefly' special. I appreciated the touches of the past blended in this futuristic setting, along with the zen and philosophical elements, making it a sci-fi western I'd say, and a very entertaining and engaging one.The camera shots add to the ride. They're spooky sometimes, and they're very effective. Wedon does a great job, and he wears his hats, that is creator/writer and director, very well. The writing is smart, the humor sharp, and everything just fits. I recommend it to all sci-fi fans, Wedon fans, for sure, and I also recommend it to everyone who wants to escape 2005 for two hours with a jolly great ride of a movie. Enjoy the Kit-Kat break everyone, and don't forget the popcorn!",Serenity
1370,junk-621,"Roller-coaster, in Widescreen",9,28 August 2005,"I'll start by making it clear, I am a fan of Firefly and of Joss Whedon's writing. That being said, I am not afraid of pointing out any negatives in what he produces. His fans are often his biggest critics. Some people dismiss his writing because they feel that the characters are too witty or some such. I urge even those people to give Serenity a chance, if disbelief can be suspended to imagine a universe of the future, surely the same can be done for unrealistic wit of the dialogue.So, on to the film. As an adaptation of a television series that many in the audience wont have seen, the start of Serenity needs to be exposition heavy. It is. And as it started, I feared that it would collapse under the weight of the back story to be told. It unfolded, becoming a story within a flashback within a simulation, and we're introduced to the infinitely creepifying Operative. I heard this film was going to go to some dark places... this scene re-assured me that was the case. I almost forgot I was watching exposition-overload.During the second most lengthly shot I've seen this year (the other was Russian Ark), we're re-introduced to all the characters from the series. Then we're straight into the thick of it. Up until this point, we've just been cranking our way to the top of the roller-coaster. Now we're finally about to be let go, and one word is all that it takes.Reavers.Serenity doesn't seem to let you breathe for a moment, effortlessly flitting between hilarity, tragedy, drama and action (sometimes in the same second). Although the plot is ultimately fairly straightforward, the journey that brings you to the end is what matters - and it's a damn good one.At a time when there seems to be nothing but effects-driven science fiction (with the exception of a few notable smaller-budged efforts such as Donnie Darko), it's great to have a script that cares about it's characters as much as the events.To any Star Wars fans looking for that 1977 magic. To any Star Trek fans looking for characters to care about. This is your next port of call.Serenity is science-fiction at it's finest.And if you get a chance, catch Firefly on DVD first.",Serenity

I don't cry in movies, I did in Serenity. I don't cheer in movies, I did in Serenity. This movies takes what was an incredible television series, and elevates it and completes it so well. Not every subplot was taken care of, but that didn't matter, there was this incredible sense of closure. Great plot, incredible performances, and not a boring bit the whole way through. Hopefully this movie will do well and the 2 planned sequels will go ahead.

1374,raswadio,Go see this film...,8,29 August 2005,"I enjoyed the Firefly series and gradually became a fan. This fact may have clouded my vision somewhat but I have tried to be as concise and objective as possible, so straight in...The start of the film is very cleverly worked. Many things are explained in several different formats, with each inadvertently introducing the next until you are faced with a rough idea of what the situation is. A couple of characters are involved here so you get the general gist. I can imagine many people unfamiliar with the Firefly series prematurely presuming lead character roles from the offset, but you soon realise that this is a film for all the characters. As the film begins to progress – at first with a reasonably light witty tone – you can see how each member of the crew assumes their position aboard the space ship Serenity. I felt this part of the film was extremely well written, with a good balance of dialogue for all of the characters and a buoyant rhythm. The witty remarks slowly give way to minor conflict and the generally amiable crew begin to show sides of their personalities that were not revealed during the Firefly series. This opens the door for subtleties in character that affect the course of events and how decisions are made, providing a little more believability when characters do make decisions – once again, excellent writing.The film score mixes typically classical ambient music with Americana tinged folk guitar. It should age well and not inadvertently date the film as so many Nu-Metal soundtracks of this era and genre surely will. This musical mixture works well and assists with mood setting – as it obviously should – especially in the final third of the film. When the action heats up and the story becomes clear, a few good emotional twists and turns really capture your attention. This part of the film will definitely appeal more to Firefly fans. Anyone else, with less of a vested interest in the characters may not get as much out of these scenes. This, I fear will be the case for quite a few of the 'moments' during the film, that to one may appear inspired, but to another just a tool for plot progression.As the film races toward the climax you are given a real sense of apprehension and you are truly unsure about what will happen – both to the characters and to the larger elements of the story.The end of the film is totally believable and logical while still maintaining realism, faithfulness to characters and an action packed finale. All this is wrapped up nicely, leaving many feelings – all of which positive.This is a warm, complex, yet effortlessly performed story about good and evil (where good and evil are not so clearly defined). It is a film where – if told from different perspectives and following different characters– you would have a completely different opinion about which characters are good and which are evil. I really like how this is done. The writer has done a sterling job of raising a few moral issues and he acknowledges the grey areas of human morality and it feels quite refreshing. This is truly a good film in many ways. The humour may begin to tire the dry and more cynical among us, and the overall premise, and story may seem slightly misplaced to others, but these are criticisms I have laboured to find, and don't personally agree with. Seriously, go and see it",Serenity
1375,wendyc-2,I am upset about this film.,7,29 August 2005,"**Contains Spoiler** **Spoiler alert**I was really upset by certain parts of this film. OK so, Joss Whedon had something to say, and part of what he is about is unexpectedness and killing off important characters is part of that whole process. But come on, what a huge mistake he has made with the main person who has been killed off in this film. What was Joss Whedon thinking? Has he actually thought out what this means? Everyone else on this site is talking about how huge this will be and how everyone will go for this film and there will be sequels, etc. Well I now go on record to say that, in my opinion, he has probably blown his chances of a sequel. It just makes no sense in what he has done. He has destroyed the heart of his series, the one person who brought the ""everyperson"" type of humanity to the show. It is really inexplicable as to how he could have done this, how the characters and storyline have been allowed to be sidelined by the death of one special character. The film for me then becomes negated by this death. I know life is something that cannot be taken for granted and that unexpected things do happen, but the inconsistency in the manner of the death of this character, and the fact that this character died in that particular place as well, does not seem possible. I realise that it is too late to do this, but I cannot understand why you are letting this version run when it is so inconsistent and unbelievable, as well as just plain ridiculous. I would firmly suggest alternate endings on the DVD which will inevitably come out and which my family will buy. We are not totally unhappy with this film, in fact it was otherwise really well done, and we loved the script in the main. Well Joss you have obviously aimed to shock and you have succeeded in that. But I am very disappointed and disillusioned. The fans have stood by you to great effect, so why have you taken away the best character in the whole series? If there is any way to do a prequel or to bring this character back, I would strongly suggest doing just that if you are able to get another film or series off the ground which I do honestly doubt now. Thanks for all the effort you have put in though, and for giving the actors a chance to reprise their TV roles on the big screen, which they have done to very great effect.",Serenity
1376,ninelo,Firefly,10,29 August 2005,"I was put aback when this great TV show was canceled in it's 1st season.

I only hope others that feel this way will also try and convince the networks. It is so rare anymore to find a truly great show that has such an engaging format. i have always loved scifi type shows, and this one is no exception. I only hope that one day we will have Firefly back on the air for future generations to enjoy. I know my children will love this as they have taken to scifi as well by being around me. Thanks to you all for supporting this show.",Serenity
1377,jeanine1957,What a Rush!!!,10,1 October 2005,"What a rush!!! I was sitting on the edge of my seat and biting my nails! Joss has done it again. Universal Pictures, Sci-Fi Channel, and Fox Network take note. We want more! If the friend who went with me to see the movie hadn't been going someplace else this afternoon we would have turned right around and gone right back into the Theater to see it again. The fan base wants more Serenity any way we can get it.I recommend this movie to anyone who even remotely likes Science Fiction and even to some who don't. You don't have to be a Browncoat or to have seen Firefly to enjoy this movie. As it is I will be going back to see it as many times as my schedule and my budget allow. It is a shame that it was not more widely distributed. As it is I am forced to travel over 60 miles just to find a theater that is showing it. It is worth the time, effort, and gas money to get there.",Serenity
1378,Transhumanist,Nothing short of Outstanding,10,12 September 2005,"Right from the first scene, Serenity was true to its TV origin without being weighed down or limited by it. The acting is top notch. Each of the characters were fantastically portrayed, albeit with a bit more polish than before. The step to the big screen brought larger sets, massive space scenes, and amazing action sequences. This movie is a shining example of how movies should be. The roller-coaster of humor and tension, action and acting, space and cowboys, love and war, was so thoroughly enjoyable, I was energized and exhausted by the time it was over. You don't have to see Firefly before you see Serenity. It stands completely on it's own, but I highly recommend you watch every episode (in the proper order) now. Of course fans of the show will love it, but if you're a fan of just flat-out well made movies, you'll be a fan before you walk out of the theater. But don't take my word for it, see it for yourself.",Serenity
1379,merriottcolin,Great little film,8,14 November 2016,"Full of fun things from nice effects of the day, to the use of simplified English tinged with Chinese over tones, loved the idea of the 17 year old girl killing machine. Also loved the links to a true cult classic sci-fi forbidden planet. Did anyone spot it. Found in two places on the crashed ship on Miranda. In big bold markings on the hull, and inside main cabin. C57D. This was the deep space cruisers I.D on its way to Altara on a recovery mission. Great film. No real link between stories in as much one man attempted to act as god like teacher after having his intellect increased by an alien device, and a government attempted to act God by attempting to change the nature of man via bio science. Both good but the original classic so much better especially knowing it's a mid 1950s film 50 year separation. So if you want a fun film for a rainy afternoon, buy serenity.",Serenity
1380,ConditionOne,Sci-Fi as realistic as it gets.,10,9 October 2005,"You know how Penn & Teller described their magic act as being for adults who hate magic? Well, ""Serenity"" and it's TV predecessor ""Firefly"" could be sci-fi for adults who hate sci-fi. AND, it will also grab every single ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars"" fan who values acting, gritty real world scenarios and character-driven story telling over special effects for special effects' sake.In my mind ""Star Trek"" went downhill from ""The Wrath of Khan"" (don't get me started on the first Trek movie) and ""Star Wars"" went downhill from the first movie. ""Serenity"" is better than both of them, and barring the death of the writer/director Joss Whedon, it WILL be the next big franchise. Get in on the ground floor!",Serenity

""Serenity"" is the new ""Star Wars"" I feel and should be seen by all the fans of ""Star Trek"",""Star Wars"",""Battlestar Galactica"",""Babylon Five"" and ""Firefly"". It kept my attention throughout the movie and provided the continuity needed to continue the ""Firefly"" storyline. It reacquainted me with all the characters of ""Firefly"" and made the continuation of that TV series a must for all its'fans. I highly recommend that everyone see this movie. I am sure that it will be extremely successful at the box office and hope with that success it will lead to a permanent series both on TV and at the Movies.",Serenity
1382,andy-1270,Wow!! (Possible spoilers),10,26 October 2005,"I am not going to go on about the plot for Serenity or give a breakdown of characters from the series / film, as so many other people have given perfectly good explanations in their posts. These are just my impressions.I first saw the trailer for this movie about 2 months ago, and thought that it looked like a good film with some comedic moments. Looking for info on the web, I came across Firefly, so decided to hunt that out and watch it, I can truly say I was blown away, and watched the whole series twice in a week.Once the film was released I went to see it and walked out of the theatre dragging my chin on the floor. I have now seen it 3 times, and can't wait for the DVD to be released!*** Here be (minor) Spoilers ***My favourite bits of the movie all revolve around River, and two key scenes in particular:Near the end of the film, when pinned down and Simon is shot, when River says ""My Turn""... My god, what a moment!Not long after that, when the blast doors open to reveal River standing in shadow holding the axe and sword... That has to be one of the best images I have taken away from a film in a long time, and sent shivers down my spine when I first saw it.The film as a whole stands out for me, but the two scenes above just seem to stand out that bit more :)As for sequels... lets hope Joss gets the funding / green light for these, and lets also hope he doesn't do a Lucas and makes us wait for years for them! :)If you haven't seen this film, GO SEE IT! and whilst your at it, get online and order Firefly... You will not be disappointed.",Serenity
1383,utakata,Excellent television to film cross-over.,9,5 September 2005,"When I first watched Firefly, I was not quite sure what to make of it, the concept was interesting the characters were unique, but I still wasn't sure if I liked it and I never really got a chance to find out as the show was swiftly taken off air. Well, after seeing the film at a recent preview screening I realized just how much I actually had enjoyed it and I am thankful that this opportunity was given to Joss and his team to continue his story. This is the perfect sort of cross-over entertainment. The film is entirely faithful to the TV series whilst still allowing new viewers to enter into Joss Whedon's incredible future. It is great to see these characters up on the big screen and their interaction is faultless. Summer Glau's performance as River is of particular importance and she pulls it off stunningly. The story takes place both before and after the existing series and helps to flesh out most of the main characters, but mostly adds to River's back story and the continuation of the crew's ""adventures"". The film also helps to enhance the world already created. It is great to see a Science Fiction film where story takes precedence over special effects and this is one such film. Yes there are plenty of CG shots, but they do not distract from the story. The scenery, action and costumes are all on par with any of today's biggest blockbusters and the dry humor that Joss's writing is renowned for is also intact. There are also a number of surprises in store for the many fans, but I will not elaborate any further than that. I must say it is nice to see a Television series that got cancelled well before it even got started, get a chance to continue its story in another medium, let's just hope it is successful enough to make the studios sit up and take notice.",Serenity
1384,andyswanson,"""You can't stop the signal."" I'm grateful I can't! I want it all.",8,2 October 2005,"Before writing this I should state for the record: I have seen all 14 episodes of Firefly and I honestly can't say if this movie would have been as great without that character history... Having said that then this is next: Serenity was as close to perfect as I could have hoped for. I heard the buzz about this flick a few months back and I thought it might be interesting so I rented the series Firefly. I enjoyed it, though it definitely didn't blow me away. I'll even say that I could understand it's lack of appeal to some, but nonetheless I found myself excited for the movie; I believed that it had real big screen potiental. High expectations are usually the downfall of a film. The better I think it's going to be, the more disappointed I inevitably am. This was a great movie that met and even exceeded my very high expectations. It was paced perfectly with no wasted film. If I could find one real fault with it it's this: Whedon could have made it about two minutes longer... Without giving a single thing away I'd say that the epilouge could have used a bit more depth.Worth watching... twice... in the theater alone... then buy it on DVD.",Serenity
1385,fresh_rain,Sci-fi with the great human touch,10,8 September 2005,"Any TV-cum-movie is in for a tough time trying to generate an audience out with the initial fan base. That said, Whedon rips through the exposition in the first five minutes with some skillful visual trickery and editing that should leave fans satisfied and newcomers comfortable.Then there is action, bucket-loads of it. And tears, and laughter, and absolutely brown-pant scary moments. This film has it all, but what it has at its centre is the emotions of the characters, not vast amounts of special effects. I won't spoil the plot, but it does centre on River and her psychic abilities. That said, everyone of the nine initial characters of the TV incarnation Firefly receives adequate screen time, save perhaps for Book and Inara. The actors are on fine form, notably Summer Glau and Nathan Fillion, and Alan Tudyk's comedy timing is the best I have seen. The special effects are amazing, and I'm not just talking CGI. I was one of the few who complained that the opening sequence of Episode 3 was too static. Here, when Serenity is in a firefight, we are caught up in the thick of it. The CG blurs, zooms, pans,twists, sometimes missing the action - just as it did on the show - but it works better on the cinema screen - you feel immediately involved in what is happening. The make-up artists jobs on the scary-as-hell Reavers is fine as well. Ultimately though, the success of this film will lie on the writing of Joss Whedon, and it is very well conceived idea, both on page and on screen. I have to wait three months before I see it again, and I already want a sequel. This is one ship I hope keeps on flying.",Serenity
1386,senorquackers,Serenity Fight or Flight,10,1 October 2005,"First of all let me say that I love the television show, I watch them every chance I get. Now that you know that, let me say that the movie is better. I fully intend to see it 3 or 4 times before it goes out of the theaters. The acting in the movie is marvelous and at no time did I feel that it was in any way cheesy. By the end of the movie I found myself giddy with anticipation about what would happen next, something that hasn't happened since the first Matrix movie debuted all those years ago. The movie does go against some things that we learned in the television series but I wasn't mad about that I actually prefer it to be the way that the movie plays them out. Joss Whedon clearly had a lot of control in this movie and that is definitely a good thing, the jokes, the characters, and the scenery are all amazingly crafted in his unique style. Even if you didn't like Buffy, Angel or Firefly like some of my friends did when they came to see the movie you will still walk away amazed by what you have seen. One of my friends asked if I could lone him my Firefly DVDs after seeing the movie, this being after he had earlier turned me down several times when I asked him if he wanted them. Like the Matrix movies I mentioned earlier, I believe that there is little chance that Serenity will not have a sequel or two, and in the best case scenario a continuation of the television series combined with the occasional movie like the Star Trek series have been. Serenity is a great movie and if you haven't seen it already you definitely should.",Serenity
1387,matthew-molitor,This movie was shitastic.,1,2 October 2005,"This movie reminded me of Starship Troopers - just take everything that was good about Troopers and f it up - slow moving, bad storyline, no nudity. This movie was interesting for the first 3 minutes and then you got on the ship with ""Mal"" and it steadily worsens a rate comparable only to a jump into hyperspace. If If you could manage to avoid the horrible, cornball comedy relief that was interwoven throughout every other line this you have at best a crummy television show worth watching only at the earliest hours of the morning.One thing I must say, WHY TAKE A STAND AND FIGHT IT OUT IN FRONT OF THE IMPENATRIBLE BLAST DOORS!? I have already wasted 119 minutes of my life on this movie and I shall waste no more, lest to say, don't waste yours.",Serenity

A feature film is only so long.Joss and the cast and crew have 'done the impossible' - this film works just as well for Firefly fans and for people new to the universe.In the process of grabbing our new comrades, very little time is devoted to answering the many questions left from the series; indeed, I'd say more new ones are generated than are laid to rest. We Firefly fans don't get to see all the sides of our beloved crew we are used to; Mal, in particular, shows more of his hardass side than the romantic we know is there. But rather than detracting from the film, it forces us to remember that the aspects we see most of in the film were always there, and makes us look forward to another film or films to fill in those blanks for the new fans.I cannot discuss the detail of what I love about it without making spoilers. Suffice it to say that nothing is easy in this movie, nothing is cheap, and every moment counts. It's a gem. Don't miss it.",Serenity

So when i heard that this was on the way i was rather excited, boy was i ever wrong to be. What i wasn't expecting to see was ""Buffy in Space"", which is essentially what you've got here. Big budget space movie it may be, but none the less we have all the repeated Whedon character types, the faceless hordes of unstoppable killing machines, the evil government organisation and the teenage supergirl. If you're a Buffy fan and were hoping for something new i'm afraid Joss has let you down. On the other hand if you don't mind watching recycled Buffy dialogue and action you're in for a pleasing lobotomy of a film.",Serenity

1391,igblackadder,"Fine, for what it is.",5,18 September 2005,"The film was fairly enjoyable, a fast paced story, action and some vaguely amusing dialogue. But don't get it out of proportion, all you who have given it 10/10. It is just an action movie. It may very well be a good example of the genre but it is not great cinema. What makes film different and better than just TV is the fact that film is a visual art form. Joss Whedon of Buffy fame may be good at creating a bit of suspense and a rapid heartbeat, but by no means has he embraced the full potential of the big screen. There is one inspired exception which to give the film it's dues, is impressive. The opening shot uses the ""Universal"" logo. After the text has appeared the camera moves through the lettering towards the earth before space ships come hurtling past the camera. This is however the peak of the film from a visual stand point. Certainly if you want to be entertained by a film this will meet your criteria, and fans of ""Firefly"" some of whom I talked to after the screening at this years Edinburgh International Film Festival were impressed by the film. For anyone wanting to see a truly great film as the ratings that people have posted on the IMDb would seem to suggest, you will be left wanting something more than a bit of romance, fighting and the occasional bit of humorous banter. I am not saying that this is a bad movie, simply that to give it such a high rating is without just cause.",Serenity
1392,cbutler-4,Better than the last of the Star Wars series,9,13 October 2005,"all the right elements are in the mix: the pace is fast without being confusing, the humor dry and witty, the action exciting and suspenseful. if anything is missing its the over-blown (and obvious) computer graphics and clichés of a doomed futuristic world that have become the standard for sci-fi (or any other summer blockbuster, for that matter).rather, this is an actual story of people with complicated pasts and uncertain futures; it just happens to be set in outer space. this movie should become the touchstone for all movies, but especially sci-fi, wherein the focus is on how each particular person -- in keeping with his character -- reacts to the action and environment.i give it a 9 merely because i save 10s for movies such as ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""The Magnificent Seven"", but i suspect that ""Serenity"" will become a classic in its own right.",Serenity
1393,karlcarp,OK Film Over Hyped,6,14 October 2005,"Good acting by some including Nathan Fillion (Mal), but the cast is weak to say the least. A good plot and some excellent scripting lost with the lack of experience in the cast. Overall quite enjoyable but not in the region it has been given by the media. Maybe a lack of good summer films and other let downs aka. ""Star Wars"" (also over hyped and spoilt) has made this film appear better than it actually is to them. The film is lack luster to say the least. It is what it is a good film full of good for Television actors with the exception of Nathan Fillion. He has proved he is worthy of the big screen. But after this still worth a watch as the plot is so complete. Watch it but don't expect too much and then it will give you more enjoyment. Karl",Serenity
1394,ashelon-1,A Testament to Second Chances,10,3 October 2005,"Before going to see ""Serenity"" for the first time, I came to find it was a movie based on a show that has met the fate of many shows...cancellation. But a show is never canceled from lack of quality, but rather lack of quantity in people watching it. For this reason, strong shows meet this fate, and fade into memory. Luckily for me, Universal Studios got to it first, and for that, I am grateful.Based on the short-lived, Fox network series ""Firefly"", Serenity is about the adventures of a crew aboard a space vessel sharing the same name, and at the opening of the film, we are given a brief intro to the characters. From no-nonsense,all business Captain ""Mal"" to the cute-as-a-button gear-head Kaylee (who, played well by Jewel Staite, struck a few chords in my heart, no doubt). The characters play off each other very well, and Joss Whedon has us growing onto them, and the story moves along without a hitch, throwing in plenty of twists and turns to keep me satisfied. The cold villain of ""The Operative"" contrasts greatly to the hero of Mal, who I rooted for every step of the way.I hope this movie gains enough in quantity of people watching it for Sony to recognize its powerful quality as a revamped show. I will definitely watch the series already produced, and any shows and/or movies in the future.10...out of 10...and rightfully so. Amazing. (Now if only I can see the two minutes I missed on two trips to tell an usher to take care of some talkers). Definitely worth my $6.50 ($8.00 once they take a look at my student ID and see it's expired :)",Serenity
1395,corbindeus,"I, for one, was disappointed...",9,30 September 2005,"First, I want to say that I am a HUGE fan of Firefly and think Fox is incredibly lame for letting it die. That said I was rather disappointed when I watched the movie. It started out strong, with a feel very much like that of the series and I was, initially, quite impressed. Sadly, the movie took a turn for the worse as the plot began to jump around without really developing. I was further saddened to see that characters, pivotal to the series, were relegated to minor rolls bordering on mere cameos.If the intent was to make a movie that a non-fan could walk into and appreciate, again, they failed miserably. Too much of the character interaction alludes to things that happened in the series. This wouldn't be so bad if the dynamic we came to know, as fans, was still in place, but many of the relationships seem to have changed and the general atmosphere of the ship has moved towards violent head-butting.All this said, I do think that the overall plot of the movie was interesting and the music was subtly delightful, the kinds of things we came to expect of the show. But all said and done, I think ""Serenity"" ended up being a movie for the fans that will anger many of the fans off. There is room left at the end for a sequel; I hope Joss is up to the task of once again capturing our imaginations.",Serenity
1396,matthew-tanner,Who decided that making a film of a cancelled TV show would be a good idea?,4,20 September 2005,"I just saw a preview of this film at the cinema last night (It was a blind screening, I didn't know what film I was going to watch), and I have to say I was disappointed. I'd never seen the TV series, so I wasn't influenced by that, and as a stand alone film I thought it was poor.It was full of clichés from the opening voice-over monologue to the final speech by the captain, Mal. The script seemed laboured and cheesy, like they'd taken the writers from The Bold and the Beautiful and told them to write the dialogue. At times it was trying to be Star Wars (the alliance/government as the bad guys, the witty banter between crew members), then going all 'old school Star Trek', failing to be anything more than a poor imitation on both counts. The plot was also contrived and obvious, and although the outcome is apparent in most films, there was nothing in this that made me enjoy watching them get there. I didn't care whether they completed the mission or not, or whether they all died or not. (In fact by the end of it I hoped they would, just to give it a little twist, something to stop me waiting for the inevitable ending.) However, the special effects were of a good quality (although there's no excuse for bad fx nowadays so that doesn't count), and the actors did a good job on the whole with pretty bad material. For me though, it lacked substance, style, and originality, and never broke away from being anything more than a feature length episode of a TV series.Talking to a friend about it today, I realise that the DVD of the series sold millions and it'll therefore probably do good business at the box office on the fan base alone, but to me it is obvious from watching this why the series was cancelled.",Serenity
1397,dark_ditto2000,Just an Incredible summation to the series,10,6 July 2006,"not as great as the series, but then nothing really is. this movie shows a lot of Whedon's talent, and i noted a little anger when he went on a killing spree at the end of the movie, a little jab at Fox Studios.either way, i enjoyed the way he was able to be a little bit more free in fleshing out the characters (the alcohol for example) which was restricted in a television show, and the way the movie drew to a grand ending, from as Mal would put it ""simple folk"" it does seem a bit big for the crew of serenity, who i enjoyed a whole lot more on their little missions, but if you can't have that, why not get the next best thing, eh?",Serenity

Joss Whedon and the Cast of Serenity/Firefly show so much heart and caring for their fans and for their work. An excellent story. Characters you want to know and go have a beer with at your local saloon. Incredible effects that help to tell the story without pulling you out of it. Music that makes you feel the full range of emotions the characters portray on screen. All this and so much more make Serenity a great film.

I'm so ANGRY, All TV executive's should be round up and shot, the story was well realised, the character definition fantastic, but why did Josh have to use the stories that would of kept us enthralled for a good 3 seasons of a TV to prove the merit of this excellent series in a feature film. Don't get me wrong, with the extended budget and reappraisal of all the main characters in their original roles, made this a joy to behold, but as i've read in another comment, to which i whole heartedly agree, this could be a new series the likes of star trek, even Babylon 5, which as everyone knows was also not supported and mucked about with right in the penultimate series.If anyone with any influence reads this, take note.

The TV show was one of the best shows I have seen in a LOOOONG time, and the movie was.....well almost as good, I didn't like that they killed Washburne, the priest I didn't mind so much, but not Washburne he was a part of the family on the ship.

1401,pkitty-1,"Shiny, shiny movie with its share of darkness",10,1 October 2005,"Two questions seem to come up a lot, that I'll try to answer here: ""I loved the show Firefly! Will I love or hate this movie?"" Serenity is not Firefly. Joss Whedon makes that abundantly clear over the course of two hours, making sets bigger, raising the stakes, and adding a rather bold splash of death and mayhem to the mix. The characters we know and love are changed forever in this movie, and my hat is off for his willingness to say, ""This is Serenity. We can never go back to Firefly again."" The things that we loved about Firefly are still there, mind you -- the witty, well-timed humor, the characters and their interaction, the ""slice of life"" asides that make you forget it's scripted, and so on. This is an amazing adaptation that's just begging for a sequel (or two). ""I never saw the show! Should I bother catching the movie?"" See it. You'll be just fine. Everything you need to know is covered in the opening scenes. A flashback introduces Simon and River (the two fugitives) and then a great shot-in-one-take sweep through Serenity herself gives you a handle on the crew, what they do, and what kind of person each is. From there, you're pretty much as caught up as the rest of us, because everything after that is new, new, new. There's no cumbersome back story to catch up with (the movie's setting can be -- and is -- explained in a few sentences, the exposition being woven into a teacher's lecture to some children at the beginning) and the theme and plot don't rely on anything else from the show. Serenity is part sci-fi, part western, and all good old-fashioned ""outlaws with a heart of gold versus the evil empire"" fun. It's well written, unpretentious, full of action, loaded with countless nuggets of sheer hilarity, and directed and acted by some of the best talent on the screen today. I really cannot recommend it enough.",Serenity
1402,cookieandpie,made for TV and Taht's where it should have stayed,1,19 February 2006,"Should have been a made for TV movie. Rating it for the big screen, I would give it a zero since it was the typical clichéd television crap and offered nothing interesting for a serious film buff. Fans of the program must think it was as important as Casabalnca or Citizen Kane. Give us a break.This was mediocre Sci-fi at best. I'm sure it met some people's excitement needs the way a video game does, but there was nothing artistic or original about the storyline or the acting. When a movie is made to appeal to a cult following, it usuallybut not alwaysdoes not have to present anything that is outside of the formulaic expectation of people who belong to that particular cult of viewers. ""Serenity"" did not attempt to appeal to people who did not follow the TV program. I love Science fiction and for years have been mystified by the sad fact that the many excellent science fiction stories that are in print are not made into films. Good science fiction always leaves the reader or the viewer with something to talk about. The only thing to say about ""Serenity"" is how ordinary it was, and how much of a waste of time it was.",Serenity

Other than the acting it was OK, but it drove me nuts the entire movie of how they could of had something really cool but blew it, and you know the really sad thing is that the Wash(Alan Tudyk) probably has the most acting experience out of all and he dies near the end! I mean what the hell is that?! I have not seen the series and was wondering if Alan Tudyk was even in it, but if he was and he has lost his role than that has to be the stupidest thing ever.

Now, everyone I know is going to!This movie is truly an amalgam of every kind of movie there is. Based in the sci-fi genre, it also combines horror, thriller, action, martial arts, and best of all, a truly witty script. As a sci-fi fan, it was a very rewarding experience. From start to finish, you never really know what is going to happen next. Equally rewarding was the clever writing and delivery. Seriously, how many times do you really get to hear the person next to you snort from laughter during a thriller? I strongly recommend this movie. I just as strongly recommend that you stop by the restroom before it starts...",Serenity
1406,Orcasview,High Marks,9,22 January 2006,"I only saw a few episodes of the TV show and was very impressed by the writing and character development. The movie version did not disappoint me in either category. I cannot give the movie my highest rating as it did fall into a few predictable and unrealistic sequences (especially the fight scene in the generator room). I highly recommend this movie for the internal struggles all the characters must endure. The visual effects are on par with other recent Sci-Fi movies and I also like how the set designers made this well worn ship look inside. Someone had a good time rummaging through a commercial aircraft bone-yard! Finally, I must commend the writers and cast in keeping it true. No good or bad, only gray. The way life really is. A most enjoyable 2 hours - A great story, great cast and a few surprises thrown in.",Serenity
1407,sabatino-18,All I hoped for and more.,10,26 September 2005,"I was lucky enough to attend one of the advanced screenings in June. The movie was all I had hoped it would be. If you love(d) the Firefly TV series, as I do, then you will not be disappointed. The movie picks up where the series left off. Joss does throw some surprises (shocks) at you, but he also answers some questions that were never addressed in the show. If you have never seen the TV series, go to the movie. You will not be disappointed. Joss is a genius at writing people. It is hard not to become attached to the crew of Serenity. With the fantasy space genre having it's huge gold star standards, Serenity has discovered a niche that hasn't been explored before. It has also found a unique was of rediscovering the western in a modern setting. I look forward to seeing the final version this weekend!",Serenity

From what I have seen from the trailers of Serenity it looks to be the same formula. Mr. Whedon if you ever see this please make more episodes of firefly and release it in Britain. Firefly is world class entertainment an something you can watch over and over again. It has the same cast as Serenity. James Fillion plays his character very well as does everyone in Firefly. Alan Tudyk is very good as always. Adam Baldwin plays his character to all it's potential. I wish I could say all the cast but it would be more than 1,000 lines.",Serenity

You poor, poor souls, you must live life without knowing the joy that is Serenity, and those that have not seen Firefly, ahhh.. so heartbreakingly horrible. It's just wrong to deprive someone or yourselves from Serenity or Firefly. I suppose it helps me to realize that you don't know what you are missing, so it isn't as horrible as it may seem, so life can go on for you all that have missed this writing/directing/acting accomplishment from what we call Hollywood now. It comes from such a twisted place and it shines so brilliantly, in any comparison, but to the general CRAP that is Hollywood it is a shiny beacon for others to aspire to.",Serenity
1410,dammit-i-rock,Undoubtedly the best film I've seen this year!!!,10,27 September 2005,"I would begin this by saying that I feel having seen Firefly before seeing Serenity did contribute to the near transcendent experience I had along with two other Firefly lovers when I saw this film. I wouldn't say it is essential, but it certainly further enhanced the unfathomable brilliance of this film I went in to the film with fairly middling expectations. A film coming from a cancelled TV series does on paper sound a little dubious. But I was a big fan of Firefly and so was very much looking forward to seeing the film, if not quite expecting what I got.Immediately after the film, on the walk to the bus stop, we were discussing what we had seen and struggled deeply to think of anything negative. The acting is impeccable from the cast of near unknowns (Alan Tudyk especially is some sort of genius) and more surprising was the excellent use of CGI. Rather than using CGI in prestige moments in the film, bringing maximum attention to it, Whedon uses it only when the story is can be served. It just one of the myriad ways in which Whedon creates the masterwork he has achieved. His writing, the balance of comedy to pathos, of character driven moments of emotion to edge-of-your-seat tension and horror is amazing for a first time director.In short, an unexpected masterpiece of sci-fi cinema. Wonderful.",Serenity
1411,tamrakar020,Shiny! just plain shiny,10,27 September 2005,"From the title alone, you can figure that I've watched firefly and now you know that I absolutely loved it. But, lets put that all aside and evaluate this movie.First off this movie is 1 hr and 59 min long, which is about the standard movie length, but what is better is that it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie catches your attention immediately taking you into this universe 500 years from now. As you explore the universe, characters are developed and a plot is present (that's right folks there is a plot unlike the lets be generous and say the thousands of movies created in the last 30 years.) The plot isn't a predictable one but takes many twists and turns, so trying to predict the movie just isn't going to happen. I thought, me being a Firefly fan would be able to, I was wrong. For those of you Firefly fans who are going to see it regardless of what I say, I say to you it isn't quite like the TV show, it feels like a motion picture, as it should.Let's mention that this is a sci-fi movie and with sci fi movies comes CGI and special effects. I personally absolutely hated star wars for many reasons but one of them was the special effects, they just weren't special, and mind you I love STAR WARS! Well I did, kinda still do. But the special effects in Serenity are spectacular, as I watched it I was in a kind of awe, (I was watching the action and following everything) but I thought throughout the entire thing wow it's just so pretty. And so I really do urge you firefly fan and non-firefly fan alike to watch Serenity and take the time to really enjoy one of the most well done movies in a long time.",Serenity

In every aspect, Serenity by creator Joss Whedon is destined to be regarded as one of the top 1% of all time great Sci-Fi Action films ever created. I had high hopes for a good movie that would tie up some or all of the loose ends of the unfinished Firefly series following its unfortunate and untimely cancellation by FOX. Now that I have seen the movie, I can only say Serenity by far exceeds my wildest hopes and desires. The plot, dialog, acting, sets, humor all reflect Joss's masterful skill of creating and telling a story.

Non stop action, start to finish, and a great cast of characters. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be amazed! The audience was cheering in spots, that doesn't happen very often anymore.You don't need to have seen the t.v. show on which the movie was based to enjoy 'Serenity' -- I attended with 3 people who had never seen the show, but loved the movie.If there is any justice in the world, this movie will be a huge hit, and Joss Whedon will get some satisfaction from knowing that 'Firefly' is getting the recognition it should have gotten when it was on FOX 2 years ago.",Serenity

My friend who never saw firefly thought it was one of the best movies he has seen in 10 years and now plans to go buy the first season of firefly. You will feel the same. highly recommended go see it!!",Serenity
1415,Hotrod-Heart,"Well, honestly",8,28 September 2005,"I will not act like a Firefly fan but as a movie lover here. The movie is good, and if you like Whedon's humor and ideas, you'll like Serenity. I was at the premiere at Deauville, France... we were 20 people to actually know the show and there was 1500 people in the room, so that should give you an idea how nice the digital effects are when I say that more than half of the people applauded after one of the main space scene.To the people who always talk about Whedon and what he has done (or will do) using Buffy or Angel as a reference (often to put him down), remember that it was aiming at teenagers, and that people talking about Ron Howard don't always use Grand Theft Auto as a reference... It is more an anticipation show than your regular laser, alien, and fancy pants show. The storyline Whedon created is very interesting and realistic on many aspects. And yes, even if it is not necessary to have seen the TV show before, I would strongly recommend to, at least, watch the first 3 episodes (Serenity part 1 and 2, and The Train Job) just to have a background. Watching the entire show will get you closer to the characters and the universe, and that's why people who enjoyed the show truly enjoy the movie (and gave high ratings to Serenity). If you go there just to see it, it's still a good entertaining movie. About the cancellation of the show, it was not because of bad ratings that it was taken down. It went down due to Fox's choice of time slot (the one they usually use to terminate a show), and the fact they did not really want the show but didn't want to do the same mistake they had done by not airing Buffy, so were not really helpful. Now, why do people like it so much and get personal about this? Because the cast is very close to its audience, friendly, and above all, love Firefly/Serenity, and you can see it. As I mentioned before, the universe and storyline is part of the reason too.So, maybe it's not the best movies of all time, but close to many people's heart for good reasons. Just give Serenity/Firefly a try to find out if you're a Browncoat.See you around",Serenity
1416,umespena,Here's How It Was...Watching Serenity,7,28 September 2005,"I managed to catch the advanced screening in Winnipeg...the radio was giving away tickets as prizes. I'm happy to report that the theatre was full, and there were obviously a lot of die hard fans there (people it t-shirts and stuff).And on to the story...There were some things about the movie that I loved, some I liked, and some that I was either disappointed in or just didn't really understand why they went in that direction.First, the movie looked spectacular. The universe itself was beautiful, the action mezmerizing, and the effects were wonderfully done. Definitely worth the extra money! Also, I was really pleased with all of the actors' portrayals of their characters, they all did an excellent job...but then we've seen them on TV and expected that. I was split over the characters themselves though; some of them REALLY strayed from their TV versions. Inara, Zoe, Book, River, Wash and Jayne were pretty much the same (excellent!), except Wash wasn't quite as funny, and Jayne wasn't quite as crude. But I don't know what the heck happened to Mal, Kaylee, and to a lesser extent, Simon. Their personalities and relationships seemed to fly right out the window only to be replaced by pod people.The Mal/Kaylee dynamic was one of the best parts of Firefly; they had a real affection for each other and gave the whole ship a sense of family. Especially Kaylee. But in Serenity Mal was harsh and cruel, much more so than even in the pilot episode. The character still worked, because Mal is an excellent 'hero', but he still seemed a long way away from the lovable (and usually amusing) Captain we all know and love. Kaylee was the biggest shock though: she seemed to dislike Mal a little, even going to the point of blaming him outright for problems with Simon and River and talking to Simon about him behind his back! Sweet Kaylee was the soul of the crew on Firefly, but movie-Kaylee was just a side character. They had very little interaction, and when they did it mainly consisted of them yelling at each other over something or other; the closeness from the series was not there.Kaylee and Simon were another disappointment. Nevermind that Simon has completely lost his dry wit and general likability, the movie opens with Simon and Kaylee acting like they had barely ever spoked to each other, like Kaylee had spent the last year or so pining after Simon in silence, which would have been believable...if we didn't know for a fact that Kaylee was forceful, friendly, and lovable. As if we wouldn't remember their shaky steps towards a relationship in the series! I was a little disappointed in some of the plot lines as well. While it was nice to have the Reavers explained (finally!), we didn't get much of an explanation on the Allied Governments. It's made clear in the movie that the government did something to River, but the Acadamy isn't mentioned, and there are no ""hands of blue"" in this flick.There was no talk of Blue Sun, and we still don't find out anything about Shepard Book. I'm hoping that these are issues that the Amazing-Mr. Whedon is saving for the sequel...fingers crossed. I'm also really hoping that we'll see our fallen characters again in the sequel, whether through flashbacks or some futuristic revival. Oh yes, and maybe Mal, Kaylee, and Simon will be our lovable crew again! All in all, I rated it a 7. Even though I was upset about the tragedy of the Mal,Kaylee...and Simon...characters, the action worked, and they virtually ignored what had happened in the series (acting as if Simon and River had just got on board), it was nice to get some answers about River. A few of the newbies in the audience seemed unimpressed, actually I heard several say that they were bored, but we can't expect them to know better; they never got the genius of Firefly in the first place. It's definitely worth seeing if you've been a Firefly fan though, because even if it doesn't live up to everything you hoped it would, it's still sweet seeing the cast together again, and continuing on with the story that we all loved and were robbed of so prematurely.",Serenity

1418,greatpaint,"Wonderful, fantastic ride",10,1 October 2005,"This movie will grow on you somewhat slowly and then knock your socks off. The movie centers on a crew of 7, formerly 9, and is based on the (cancelled) sci-fi TV show ""Firefly"", but you don't need to be familiar with the TV show to enjoy and ""get"" this movie. I don't want to spoil this movie because it is full of surprises, even for someone like me who knew a great deal of what to expect, but the plot is dependent on things being made known to the audience in a chronological fashion, so just go see it and enjoy! You will not be bored for one second. There is (quite tasteful, actually) violence but it's not gratuitous at all. There are some new horrifying ""monsters"" in this universe, something not derivative and not seen before. The two hours flew by much too quickly for me and I already need to see it again. Joss Whedon has made a very enjoyable film.",Serenity
1419,lord_knight,disappointing,5,29 September 2005,"I read with interest the various reviews so far, yet i must say these are fairly optimistic regarding what is a disappointing film. The full review follows: Serenity review After much anticipation, Serenity, the film sequel to that most brilliant of sci-fi westerns (Firefly), turned out to be rather disappointing. All the elements were there (the stellar cast of characters, the space scenes, the western facade on the planets) yet it never really added up to anything of note. It had a marvellous introduction to the film, with several flashback scenes really adding to the backstory of the series. Yet, it quickly devolves into a clichéd by the numbers science fiction generic tale. The long waited for explanation of River's behaviours and why the alliance is after her is at best trite, and at worst predictable and I daresay boring. And the Blue Sun corporation connection hinted at during the DVD commentary of the series was nowhere to be seen. Other problems beset this film also. Main characters in the series are sidelined and killed for no apparent reason. Issues that needed to be explained (such as who the Shepherd really is or was) are simply ignored. Worst of all, the emphasis on extended action scenes is clearly a sellout to the conformist cinema crowd and not at the true fans of Firefly. Also of note is that the wonderful opening music of each episode is either badly butchered or replaced. Not all is lost though. The alliance assassin's performance is quite wonderful, a cross between the bounty hunter in the episode 'Objects in space' and the Christian Bale character in 'Equilibrium'. Ultimately though, one gets the feeling that Whedon sold out his original ideas for something more studio palatable. A damn shame. One can only hope a book is eventually brought out fully explaining the plot mysteries of the series. For the uninitiated, I believe that the film is certainly quite self-explanatory, without the need to watch the series a priori. Nevertheless, bear in mind that this film is not representative of the series. 'Objects in space' is the best episode of Firefly, and perhaps any science fiction series.I hope this review is helpful as it is my first review on IMDb.",Serenity
1420,effina,Fantastic,10,29 September 2005,"Saw Serenity last night and I loved it! It's a fun, engaging movie that will thrill Whedon/Firefly fans as well as people who've never heard of either. The plot didn't drag on too much setting up background for people who hadn't seen the TV show, but gave enough to keep everyone on board (no pun intended). While it was evident at times that the budget was smallish, the energy of the film is so high that you really only notice after it's over, minor stuff really. The cast do a great job of delivering Whedon's witty dialogue and carrying their characters main traits over from the show--which I guess helped a lot in making the movie understandable/believable to those people who hadn't seen it. So, in sum, lots of energy, lots of fun and I think anyone who's a fan of sci-fi/fantasy that doesn't take itself too too seriously will really like this movie.",Serenity
1421,Asinwrath,Serenity is a good ride with a few bumps.,10,1 October 2005,"Fans of Joss Whedons Firefly series with which this movie is based would probably say (with full conviction) that this is the best thing since sliced bread, and why wouldn't they? For the die-hard fans who have worshiped Joss's Firefly series since its manifestation and cancellation, this is a good reminder as to why they have given Joss the support even after the shows end. This movie is primarily for the fans, and it certainly doesn't disappoint, tying up all loose ends with a solid and sometimes unpredictable story. However for those who have no emotional attachment to the characters and no familiarity of Joss's snappy (humor in the face of terror) dialog may well miss out on much of the movies subtle workings and power. This movie can be surprisingly emotional, sad, shocking, and a big rush for any fan of the series. Fan or not though, both types will have no trouble following this semi-epic story of a small group of heroic rebels up against a selfish and large militarized government determined to find the fugitive they are harboring. Those who are not familiar to the series of Firefly will likely see more of its flaws than the die-hard fan would likely see or admit, but will still enjoy a mostly consistent and entertaining sci-fi movie. Watching the firefly series (as I have) and then experiencing the movie, my overall impression is that Joss Whedon can make the distinct transition from TV series to movie, but not as seamlessly as one would have hoped. Although with a higher budget, at times it felt too much like a television show rather than the epic adventure it tried to be. This was perhaps mostly due to the type of camera used, and to some extent the unnecessarily quick and dizzying camera work that made it near impossible to see what was going on during action sequences that should have had more impact (the space battle is an example). Some of it just had that amateurish feel as the camera darted from one character to another, sometimes haphazardly. The transitioning from scene to scene, and planet to planet could have been more fluid and include more detail of the locations we are zipping to, to give the world a little more of an epic scope.Most of the action is satisfying and does its job well. The martial arts displayed are choreographed well, are quick and chaotic, and overall convincing. The fans of Fierfly's western music score will find the movies renditions rousing and inspire much affection for the franchise. The sometimes slim dialog characters get are mostly snappy, and allow non-fans to get a sense of each of their individual personalities given the movies focal point on a couple characters. The very last second of the movie, i felt, slightly cheapens the experience and was unnecessary, robbing it of a little more wholeness. And I did have two bones to pick (which I wont get into details about) with the main conflict between two characters whom represented good and evil. The poor judgment of our hero during two action sequences seemed uncharacteristic and reckless, feeling too scripted rather than realistic.Overall a good movie. It is hard to think that people (especially sci- fans) would feel disappointment after viewing. Good personality filled characters, with descent action that is admittedly sometimes flawed for being too loud and chaotic, and a good and unpredictable story in an unmerciful, and sometimes violent, vision of the future. For fans it is a must see, and for those who are searching for some good sci-fi should find the brutal, witty, and endearing characters to their satisfaction. 7.5/10.",Serenity
1422,joaltrogge,Just like old times...,10,30 September 2005,"I got the chance to see Serentiy at a special advanced screening two days ago. It reminded me of watching the TV show, so long ago, and I couldn't believe how amazing they made the movie! It answered some great questions that my boyfriend and I had been wondering when the show was over. We can't wait to see more! I also wonder what Joss Whedon will be up to when this movie is such a hit and all of his fans' protests to bring the show back are answered! Will there be 2 more movies like I heard rumored not too long ago or will they actually let Mr. Whedon get back to his roots on the TV show...

What I feel is most compelling was the concept of the heroes seeming more human than in any major sci-fi series. These are not caricatures of psychological archetypes, these are real humans. Every time I try to think of some flaw in it, I get the impression that what I had felt was a shortcoming might be a finely tuned device.Perhaps the best aspect of this movie is that it stays true to form. The music is nostalgic of the series and has been reworked to have more calculated emotional impact on the viewer.",Serenity

Yes, there a few changes and a surprise or two. I will let you decide for yourselves whether the changes were needed to make the jump from TV to big screen. For me they are appreciated and leave room for a sequel... (I hope). Mr. Whedon must be applauded for keeping the characters fresh and alive.

Whedon's characters are what Lucas' characters were in the original film: they're real heroes in tough places, fighting against huge odds, but at the same time they've got a healthy sense of self-deprecation and an odd, but appropriate, sense of humor. I had never seen Firefly, and what little I'd heard I'd dismissed as fanboy ravings from the video-game circuit. After I saw this movie I drove straight to Best Buy and bought the Firefly season on DVD. Joss Whedon has reinvented science fiction in a subtle way, and until you see this movie, you may not realize how necessary that reinvention was.",Serenity

1427,piratedags,"Take me out into the black, and tell them i ain't comin' back.",10,30 September 2005,"I have heard people describe their first star wars experience as transcendental. That they left the theater a man. That they remember the time, the place, and whom they were with. I cannot comment much on that, as i grew up with star wars in my life, already a part of pop-culture canon.For me, this is that film. I arrived at 10:30 for the midnight screening in North Brunswick, New Jersey with a crew of about 20; packing the comics, hoping for the best, but anticipating the worst, just in case. I went into the theater at 11:30, and we passed around the comics to interested parties. At 2:22 I emerged from that theater, muscles exhausted from the mild shaking during the intense battle scenes, from the clenching when the suspense had me soaked through with adrenaline. I emerged a man.Just for the record, I had gone in a girl. Now i'm pretty sure i could take on any of the sissy naysayers peppering my 12-hours-later afterglow with their wails of ""star wars is king"" and ""no one involved in Buffy could do anything good ever."" Guys, i'm questioning your masculinity here. The way i see it, you don't know how to deal with a girl kicking a lot of ass to save the day. Here's a helpful tip: say ""Thank You."" For the most part, i'm kidding on that point, folks.... only not really.Whedon has, once more, far surpassed the sad, soggy, gray status quo of dialogue, instead serving crispy, piping hot wit pie. Many of the shots were downright stunning, and have been haunting me all day. He pulled out the stops, covered a lot of ground, developed the characters even further, answered some questions, and raised some new ones, and wasted not one second of my two hours of viewing time. I would have happily given him more! Directors cut DVD, oh pretty please? Can we, for a moment, acknowledge that nothing in this film was ripped off of anything in any other medium? Seriously, the parallels i've seen drawn so far are weak as water. If anyone could find some accurate ones, i'd love to hear 'em, 'cause it'd give me further insight into his big, shiny thought process. I'm a fair-to-middlin' sci-fi fan, and those who have tried to draw these crooked parallels, apparently, are not. I question your sources, folks.The plot was seamless. You could pick this up and love it nearly as much as i do if you haven't seen the show. I don't want to say too much here, because I want anyone to be able to read this review, without fear of spoilers. A lot of love went into that story, and there's a lot of love IN that story, and it's in no way cloying. It's the gentle thrumming hum that starts at your feet and rises up through you, making you feel a little bit warmer than you did before. I absolutely adored that i did not know exactly what was coming next, that i had the opportunity to be surprised, shocked, and more than once elated at the events unfolding before me. Summary: It Rocked.The cast did not out-do itself, and understand my full meaning when i say this. They did not, for one second, during or after, let me think they were anything but the people on that ship. They WERE their characters, with their perfect-imperfect chemistry. They ARE their characters, each and every gorramm one of them, and I hope we can keep them happily employed on that space ship for many years to come.The special effects were not in one single way, down to the last freaking pixel, less than perfect. Zoic and R&H, anticipate my resume, please. And thanks for getting explosions in a vacuum right. We really do love you for it.My brother has described his experience thusly, and i find it apt: I went in with high expectations, and had them shattered... jagged shards of joy piercing my brain.There's a sort of giddy terror that accompanies having your expectations brought so high by a real and actual thing- a thing that has proved itself by merit- like this movie. I'm terrified nothing else will ever be this good. Except, of course, the Big Damn Trilogy. On that point, i'm just enjoying the view from here, high atop the frosty vista of Mt. Expectations, breathing deep and easy with the knowledge that what's to come will be pretty gorram shiny.And I'm not even gushing.",Serenity
1428,p8shawn,"Excellent, the Best Movie of the Season, See it soon, See it often",10,30 September 2005,"This is an excellent movie. While not need prior knowledge of what happened in the TV show is helpful. Full of snappy comebacks that I would not be surprised if they made their way into pop culture. This is what the last 3 Star Wars movies had the potential to be, if their writing didn't stink.The interaction between Kaylee and the doctor, is wonderful but having it explained earlier in the movie would have helped sell some of the jokes. The same with Mal and Inara.One of the refreshing traps that this movie doesn't fall into is having characters over explain stuff like, I am going to shoot you with phaser set on stun. The characters are familiar with there universe. Joss also use language to show us how words from different cultures will be blended into a melting pot. Similar to what has happen to the American version of English. The layer's to this film, are wonderful. What is the price you are willing to pay to live in Utopia. If you don't know what that price is is it still worth paying it? Ignorance is bliss; like all great sci-fi movies Serenity let's us explore these issues in a unique and detached way.I have only seen a couple of episodes of Firefly, and am dreadfully sorry I didn't see it before it got canceled. Not that my one voice would have stopped it. I am going to go out and by the series on DVD. I am an addict, a new convert and hope to see this show comeback to TV, like Family Guy. At least a Sequel.",Serenity
1429,yakk0nic,I was blown away,10,30 September 2005,"I can normally watch a scifi show and know the ending before it's reached it's halfway mark. The second the problem is known is the second the solution pops into my head, and I am rarely far from right. If you think about it, scifi is pretty run-of-the-mill these days, never taking any chances. And then there was Firefly. The series never failed to surprise me, and always kept me wanting more, which is why I was waiting like a caged dog when the movie was finally released today. The movie was just like the series in this way. I had no clue how it was going to end until it had. I didn't see any of the twists coming, and even when I did, they were too unbelievable to take seriously, and then they were confirmed and I was blown away again, or they were shot to hell in a humorous way.At the end I was left stunned in my seat, and all I wanted to do is watch it again. I haven't had that feeling in a long time. I missed it.Seeing the series before you see the movie is not a requirement, but it's highly recommended. The allure of the series and movie is based greatly on your affinity for it's terrific characters, which were better established in the series. It is my opinion you'll enjoy the movie better if you see the series first. Also, this isn't your run-of-the-mill scifi jazz. The solutions aren't always easy, there's not always a way out, there's not always a plan B, and the good guys don't always win.",Serenity
1430,rohacita,"All hail Mr. Whedon, for giving back the sky",10,30 September 2005,"OK, yes, I am a huge fan. So take what you will from this but oh my... I think it can be summed up by quoting the folks who walked out of the theatre in front of us after the movie was over: ""What is this feeling? I came in , paid my money, watched a movie and now I'm overwhelmed by this feeling...is it? Can it be? Complete satisfaction? No questions, no criticisms - just abject happy satisfaction.""That's exactly it... combined somehow with the feeling that I had been beaten, or through a war. It was almost exhausting. I laughed and cried (quite a bit) and gasped out loud. So so good. The dialogue was pure gold and the action caused an adrenaline rush like I've never felt from watching a movie.Can't wait for the next one. CAN NOT WAIT. (Also can't wait to see this one again... and again...)",Serenity
1431,colleen-88,Serenity Soars,10,30 September 2005,"Exciting, nerve wracking, nail biting, wiggled my foot the entire two hours - Warning - take something to chew on or you won't have any nails left! Totally Brilliant! A new classic to be added to the Sci-Fi genre! The characters picked right up from the last episode of Firefly and just kept going. I hope that our newspaper article is correct in that this picture becomes the ""Sleeper"" Blockbuster of the fall season. Even people who have never seen Firefly will be able to understand and follow the storyline and find they've paid for pure entertainment. If this is as successful as I believe it will be, one of the networks should bring Firefly back. My kudos to all who made this movie happen. You all did an outstanding job! Congratulations!",Serenity
1432,degregory,"Good story, great movie",8,30 September 2005,"Joss' ability to create great characters makes for a great movie, and I recommend that anyone see it. The characters, the actors, and their interaction with each other are great, as is the wit and humor in the story, just what you would expect of the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. That said, the story itself was disappointing in that there was little originality in it. It is a combination of Buffy in outer space, Bruce Willis' Mercury Rising and any of numerous other government cover-up based stories. I was hoping for more. Despite my disappointment with the storyline, I still highly recommend this movie to anyone even remotely interested in fast, gritty and witty science fiction action, because this movie does prove that great characters can take a decent story and make it a worthy watch.",Serenity
1433,chase-beutox,Close Enough to Perfect,9,30 September 2005,"I was turned on to the ""Firefly"" series after it was canceled. I rented the series and watched every episode in a matter of weeks. I told friends and family that the series, in many ways, was better television than Start Trek (ANY iteration), and better science fiction.""Sereneity"" carries the series to the big screen without sacrificing anything that made the show so good, and without trying to be a Blockbuster Hollywood Movie Event. The series was good enough that this latest, best ""episode"" is an excellent movie.My one regret is that the success of the movie is more likely to earn us a two-hour film every 2 years rather than an hour a week of TV episode.Action aplenty. Humor for days. Meaty, meaningful plot. Profound characters and characterizations. Not just for fans, but anyone who wants to be entertained at the cinema, and can handle some intelligence in the process. Don't wait for the DVD!",Serenity
1434,debbie-burgher,Loved it!!,10,30 September 2005,"If you loved Firefly you cannot be disappointed. Wheden is brilliant with his witty commentary and his manipulation of plot! Just when you think things can't get any worse . . . You laugh , you cry and you continue to cheer. Whedon knows how passionate we are for his characters and he writes a plot that tears at our hearts because we care so much for them. I can't say that I have ever applauded with a crowd before but I sure did this time. What a terrific ride! My only disappointment was it ended.If the God's of Fox answer my prayers I hope there will be another series with these funny adventurous characters.",Serenity
1435,sledgetzu,Fantastic!,10,30 September 2005,"Wow! Just saw it. I can't remember an audience clapping at the end of a film that I've ever seen before. Even my distinctly non-science fiction wife heartily enjoyed it. This movie has so much to offer fans of ""Firefly"" but it holds up equally on its for first time viewers. While there is too much to talk about here, I appreciate that even good characters die and endings can be bitter-sweet - I savour it after years of Hollywood sugarfests. The movie ""Layercake"" also sticks with me for this.What part of the entertainment industry doesn't understand that the public likes this series/movie? We don't need or want hokey, unscripted (but really scripted) segments of Paris or Jessica or Trump, but good stories. Reality TV needs to be sent to the glue factory for being the lame horse that it is. Serenity is worth a second and third look to get all the humour, innuendos and energy that Joss Wheldon and the cast have put into this movie. I will see it again and look forward to the series reviving and the future movie sequels.",Serenity
1436,jwholcomb,SHINY - Just what the Doctor Ordered,9,30 September 2005,"Today I saw Serenity and thru the entire movie I was amazed at Whedons ability to keep my interest and surprise me as he did. This little jewel in the rough just goes to show that Fox may have made one of the biggest blunders ever - EVER - by axing the series.Because of the quality of character definition and storyline I have already ordered the series DVD. I would be happy if the show returned as a SciFi series, but I don't think it will. I do however believe that this is a sequel machine. The actors and actresses have all found a place to entertain for as long as they and Joss Whedon will allow.Some of the plot line was disturbing and made even me squirm in my seat. I believe that any other writer/director would not have had the nerve to take the characters where he did. Gotta break some eggs to make an Omlette.In a day and age I regret having spent more than a dollar to see a movie I have seen before, I for one will be more than happy to throw my hard earned cash at this entertaining piece of the 'Verse.",Serenity
1437,player02,Josh out did himself,10,30 September 2005,"I went and saw this movie cause i knew that i'd love it and i wasn't any where close to it. This movie broke the boundaries of phenomenal it had the classic Josh Whedon humor and heartache and though i was upset with a couple...well one thing it was still the greatest movie i have EVER seen, and i've seen a lot. I'm gonna see this one again and again and again and then i'm gonna tell everyone else to see it and when it hits DVD i'm getting it and any special edition one that hits, also i'm gonna be investing in the book next payday. this movie was just fantastic and well worth the wait..though why i ask is it that all my favorite character's of Josh's have to die?",Serenity
1438,heretic_754,BAD film for non-firefly fans,3,30 September 2005,"Serenity was highly disappointing. As a devoted fan of Buffy, I was hoping Whedon's usual charm and wit would carry over into this sci-film. However, this film was actually stupid, lame and boring; to enjoy this film one requires an IQ of 75 or below, sorry firefly fans. The script was flat and predictable, acting wooden, and the climax, well what climax was there anyway?? I must have slept through it. YAWN. I left theater with wrinkled ticket stub and deep feeling of irrevocable regret coupled with physical pain in lower back. This film led to a Friday night sadly wasted, one I can never never get back! Insomnia suffers, however, this is your cure.",Serenity
1439,timmah-2,Brilliant! We have a new Sci-Fi Crown Contender,9,1 October 2005,"Well, I went into the theatre with no idea of what I wanted to watch. I hadn't even heard of Serenity, but after reading the quick blurb and being a sci-fi fan, I thought ""What the hell?"". Not expecting anything too fabulous - maybe some nice space battles, I was extremely pleasantly surprised by what I saw. The plot revolves around the Serenity and her eclectic crew. The captain is lovable and I thought very much like Han Solo. The good thing is that he doesn't own the movie, as one might think: each crew member is important, and all of them have some great comedic lines and action sequences. There are some very original characters in there as well, from the ""villain"" to some friends of the Serenity crew, each of whom are there for more than just eye candy. There are other forces who don't care for either the Serenity crew or her main enemy either, but are drawn into the plot. We later learn that they are not there simply to take up time or look pretty, but are actually an integral part of the plot. I would sum up the movie by saying it is highly original in its concepts. Every thread of the story is woven into a tight fabric, which is something sorely missed in sci-fi lately. All the characters are engaging, and the conclusion is highly satisfying. Go see it people!",Serenity
1440,tenbob-3,This movie was a shock and a disappointment,1,1 October 2005,"Judging by the comments before me, it seems to be essential not only to have watched the TV ""Firefly"" but also to have enjoyed it.After this movie had been on for about 10 minutes, I wanted to leave. However, that has happened before: a couple of notable times were ""Boys don't Cry"" and ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"". In both cases, I stuck it out and was, very early on, rewarded with outstanding film-making. Not this time! So I did not leave. After the movie was over, I was sorry I hadn't followed my initial urge.Serenity is loud, confusing (at the end, I still didn't understand it); unrealistic (fighting with spears and swords with all that technology?).I would not say it was the worst movie I have ever seen; I try not to remember those disasters. I do remember an amateur movie about a group of people walking thru the woods and encountering some ghosts or the like that was killing them off. That was hyped beyond belief and was just terrible.I'm sorry, Firefly fans, but this one didn't do it for me and I had to add my comments here.",Serenity
1441,puniceus_draconigena,Serenity is not Firefly,7,1 October 2005,"Serenity is an incredibly awesome movie, but bears only superficial resemblance to Firefly. DO SEE THIS MOVIE. However, do not expect anything but extremely shallow resolution to the intricate character stories from Firefly. Do expect an incredible, fun-filled, action-suspense-comedy-thriller as only Joss Whedon can deliver. Do not expect the fully rounded characters that we grew to love (or hate) in Firefly. Do expect some drastic character rewrites, and the most base, shallow, single-tracked identifying personality of each character to flourish. What else is there to say? Firefly is dead (DOWN WITH fox!!!). Long live Serenity (YAY universal!).",Serenity
1442,pettyproductions,Like no other...,10,1 October 2005,"First off I have to say Joss Whedon is the best Writer/Director to come out of Hollywood in the longest time. His ability to stir emotions from you is unsurpassed.Since his days on Buffy he has had the ability to drag me through all of my different emotions in a short amount of time and often leaving me to think ""what the f#$k just happened?"" With that being said, Serenity is the best sci/fi movie I have ever seen. It's special effects were good, that is true, but I think what brought it all home was the fact that I could relate to these people. By watching them I felt they were family and I could feel what they were going through. Not many directors can get me to go through that. Hollywood has lost that ability to get me to give two s@#t's about it's movies on an emotional level. Joss Whedon is bringing that back. Hopefully he has set a bar that other directors will now try to reach.Go see this movie! You won't regret it!",Serenity
1443,adam-837,Disappointing,2,1 October 2005,"It was an great movie until they killed off a character I didn't want them to. I couldn't really enjoy the movie after that.It started off good, and the storyline was interesting and the script well-written. It was pretty much what I had come to expect after watching the Firefly TV series, which I loved. The effects were good, too; although I did prefer the TV series where the sequences that occurred in space were silent. But I have this problem where I get attached to certain characters, and don't appreciate when they get killed off, even if it is realistic or works with the plot. And sure enough, someone I liked was killed. So after that, even though I thought the movie was well-made, I didn't like it.",Serenity
1444,tobyfee-1,One of the best,10,2 October 2005,"What a satisfying thrill ride. Comparisons to ""Star Wars"" are inevitable, and John Ford's ""Stage Coach"" which inspired both films. But unlike the space operas of the 70's and 80's, Firefly is actually ABOUT something. What does it mean to be a hero? How long must we mourn a lost way of life? What does it mean to sacrifice oneself to a better world? Chiwetel Ejiofor's unforgettable ""operative"" character is not to be missed, there have been few better villains. His goal of a ""world without sin"" which he for all his violence will not be worthy to enter is a gorgeous echo of modern military adventurism. Go see it. Go see it again, you won't be sorry. Buy popcorn.",Serenity
1445,lfrchef,Death?,8,1 October 2005,"I'm going to change the beginning so people just scanning can't read it. I loved this show and the characters, and frankly I thought Ron Glass finally had a great part. Whedon never developed Book and Wash's characters (or the marriage), so he just had to kill them off? Not to mention the fact that Book was barely in the movie! Are they gonna do a sequel? Are they gonna continue the series? Its certainly been set up for that. This could start a new sci-fi fan base and they've already killed off two of the core characters! Take a tip from Star Trek, Babylon 5, Star Wars and any other sci-fi show that reaches beloved status. Keep your main characters. Well, they're already dead, SO CLONE THEM!!! They cheated two wonderful characters out of potentially fulfilling roles. I actually skipped work to make sure my two bits went into the pot to make a respectable premier weekend for Serenity. And this is how you do me... SHAME ON THE AUTHOR!! SHAME ON YOU JOSS WHEDON!!",Serenity
1446,p-c-bennett18,Warning - Don't expect a masterpiece.,5,10 October 2005,"OK,at best its rip-roaring sci-fi fun. But this film never travels any deeper than its comic book/ b movie/ star trek roots. The secret, in my opinion, of good sci-fi is that it asks us questions of today's society, or at least allows us to escape to another world, but I couldn't relate to Serenity at all.So I would add a word of caution,to those expecting great things. Its nowhere near one of the greatest films of all-time,I've seen better episodes of Blakes Seven or Farscape. Maybe the IMDb has been hi-jacked by fanatics as in this case its rating is seriously flawed, perhaps normal film-goers don't bother to vote.",Serenity
1447,linksman-1,Well worth your time!,10,2 October 2005,"I just got back from seeing this movie with my family. It was very good. There are not many good space flicks to choose from, this one won't let you down. I was surprised at how good this was. I was thinking this would only be a movie for the fans of the original series, but I was wrong. My kids wanted to see this pretty badly, so I caved and went with them. I come here now to say to others like me.. don't sell this one short. If you like space adventures, this one will grab you. The characters are great and the action is superb. They don't cheat you with safe lines and defined borders. It will keep you guessing the whole time and is sort of an emotional roller coaster.I enjoyed this movie far more than I enjoyed any of the newer Star Wars movies, which all pretty much were a let down to me.Go see it.",Serenity
1448,animeyoukai,Deaths in Serenity,10,1 October 2005,"I LOVED this movie, if you only see one movie this year, go see this one. I was really upset when Shepard and Mr.Universe died, and then as I was about to stop crying, WASH DIED! I cried in the middle of a packed movie theater, surrounded by hot nerds for almost and hour! Even though he died, I absolutely LOVED this movie! River was an excellent fighter and the movie was hilarious. Even when people were dying they were still cracking little jokes. I can't tell you enough how great this movie was, I demand you all to go see it! Even if you haven't see Firefly, they catch you up in the movie.(the catching up could have been longer and more thorough, but they got to the point) I loved the way the movie was centered around River, I was a little nervous at first, but then I remembered.....IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR JOSS WHEDON TO MAKE SOMETHING I Don't LOVE! I'm going back again next weekend!",Serenity
1449,sharilea,short summary of seeing serenity,10,1 October 2005,"I have just recently (within the last two months) become a Firefly fan. Being a die-hard SciFi fan...how this series escaped me, I cannot imagine. Needless to say, after seeing the first episode on DVD, I was hooked. I just got back home about two hours ago from seeing Serenity and I have to say it is everything...and so much more than I expected. I was reading online critics' responses, and most of them gave the movie either an A or B. I believe there were two who gave it a C and ripped it apart and all I have to say about those two is that they are obviously total idiots and need to get into another line of work. I have to rate the movie as exceptional and extraordinarily entertaining.The movie is AWESOME. I was a little worried because I took a coworker with me who has never seen Firefly, and I was afraid she might not get the story line, but she absolutely loved it. So, if any of you out there have the same worries, don't. The movie works for seasoned fans and newcomers alike. How could it not? They are still the same wonderful characters as they always were...Mal, Zoe, Wash, Jayne, Kaylee, Inora, Shepherd, Simon, and River.I seriously hope that this movie gets the 'Powers that Be' to revive the series. We so want to see this lovable, ragtag crew of thieves with hearts of gold back on the television waves.",Serenity
1450,susanjs1012,The Serenity movie is shiny!,10,1 October 2005,"If you love suspense, adventure, action, and a good story too - see Serenity. The story is well told and easy to follow. Outstanding! Shiny! The transition from a television show to the big screen is seamless. Nathan Filion and company are amazing. Hats off to Joss Whedon for a great story. There is something to River's story and seeing Summer Glau in action is indescribable. This movie never misses the chance for action, suspense, excitement. The Reaver's are scary and the 'hit man' is frightening in his intense belief that he is doing the 'right thing'. There is more to the Firefly class 'boat' Serenity than we ever saw on television. See this movie, it is 'shiny'.",Serenity
1451,animefx,"Fox, are you really that stup1d? Serenity/Firefly is incredible",10,1 October 2005,"I can't believe the guys at Fox actually canceled Firefly! The DVDs are selling like crazy, and the movie is going to do very, very well. Joss Whedon is one of the best folks... I have a feeling that Firefly (Serenity) was his baby.I'm incredibly mad that this show was canceled after only 13 episodes. I can only imagine what 5, 6, or 7 (maybe 8?!) seasons would have been like... Buffy the Vampire Slayer lasted 7, and the incredible Angel series lasted only 5. I'm really hoping that at the very least Joss Whedon will be allowed, or will want to release more Serenity movies... Since he is re-opening his TV studios ""Mutant Enemy"", I see no reason why he couldn't bring back Firefly on another network... Sci-fi channel? WB or UPN anyone?",Serenity
1452,suzukibob,Loved/hated,8,1 October 2005,"I have never seen the series when it first came out, I have just became a huge fan of firefly in reruns on sci-fi, I have yet to see all of the reruns, But thanks to My cable company's Digital video recorder (DVR)I'm now able to record it every time it airs. I have five episodes recorded that I've yet to see. My point is that I love the series and I'm not going to enjoy watching the show now knowing that Wash (Alan Tudyk) was killed in the movie. It plain sucks! The feeling for me when I walked out of the theater was sad, hurt, disappointment, It takes away for me what was otherwise a great movie and series. I don't know how to get over the loss of any character on my just discovered beloved series but to kill off two, Dang!!!",Serenity
1453,switchbladedd,The best movie ever made,10,2 October 2005,"This is without a doubt the best movie I've ever seen. Whedon is a comic genius, yet is able to be sentimental and serious when he needs to be. The action scenes and the dialog are extraordinarily well written, and it extremely creative in every aspect. The characters are also very well developed. Whedon does a phenomenal job at reestablishing the plot, so that even people who have not had the great pleasure of viewing the Firefly series, will be able to understand what is happening and who these people are. The movie is always exciting and always intriguing, without any plot holes. Overall it is the best movie I've ever seen by far.",Serenity
1454,sammyk762,Worth Seeing Again...and Again,10,8 October 2005,"I think that going to movies in the theater more than once is stupid. It's a waste of money and I've only done it willingly once before. I'm getting ready for number 4.About a month ago I saw a re-run of Firefly on the Sci-fi channel. I wasn't a Joss Whedon fan, had never even heard of him and was only vaguely aware of Buffy. I only caught about half of this episode and was only half paying attention for most of it. The last scene was so...well awesome doesn't do it justice (for you fans that would be the ""Big Damn Heros"" scene). When I found out I could own the entire series for the price of a tank of gas, I decided to take a chance. It was worth it.*Every* person I have shown this series to has fallen in love with it. *Every* person I have taken to the movie has enjoyed it, and the ones who had never seen the series are asking to borrow it now.The strength of this movie is not so much plot twists or stunning visual effects, but the depth and realism of the characters. Unfortunately, two hours isn't enough time to dig into all of them, which is why you'll appreciate the movie so much more if you've seen the series. The themes are brilliantly woven into the entire fabric of the movie, which really requires at a couple of viewings to appreciate. There is no wasted dialog, even the parts that don't make sense at first. The plot has both its surprises and its inevitabilities, and every time I watch it, it flies by faster. The first time was a little overwhelming, and felt like it was about four hours long. It left me with mixed feelings. The second time there was nothing mixed about them, although I questioned whether or not I would still enjoy it a third time in two weeks. I went again. It won't be the last. Neither will it be for the ten other people I've dragged into it.Also, more dancers should become actresses who have to do martial arts sequences.In short, this universe's cult following is well deserved. I think anyone who didn't like this movie is either missing something or has a thing against cult followings. Go to it with an open mind, rent or borrow (or buy) the series as well, and you won't be disappointed.",Serenity
1455,farmerfc,Pleasantly surprised. I expected a great movie. It is a classic.,10,1 October 2005,"Serenity brims with all the best of classic space opera, but what sets it apart is the characters. These likable, human, believable people are illuminated within challenge situations that thrust them into sharp three dimensional focus. That is literature. You can't help but admire, or like, or even hate them; but you will feel they matter. The draw is a solid array of traits, some of which you can't help but identify with; then somehow part of you is right there with them. The effects are great. But ever since Star Wars we can and do expect that. But it was not the effects alone that made Star Wars resonate for people. Lucas knowingly borrowed themes others had already sifted out from all the great myths; themes they share and which seem built in to us all. Serenity does that too, but it rivals another classic, Babylon 5, in the level of character development. OK. If you know B5 you know that nothing made yet in any genre equals it for that; but B5 had five years to build in.I hope Serenity might get a sequel or two. If that odd crew has the chance, I wonder, could the dry humor, realistically imperfect situations, and reluctant heroics provide a true peer to those other classics? I think I would like to find out!",Serenity
1456,jedihealer,Go see this film.,10,1 October 2005,"This film exceeded my expectations. As a faithful ""Firefly"" watcher, I hoped the film ""Serenity"" would be good. I was thrilled when it turned out to be amazing!There are many twists and turns of the plot, keeping me guessing quite a bit. There were surprises, and Joss shows himself to be a serious filmmaker in that he doesn't go the easy road. It took guts to take the risks he did, but true fans will appreciate the result.My entire family are fans, and we ""debriefed"" for almost an hour after we arrived home after seeing the film. That alone attests to it's depth and excellence. I am still turning the story over and over in my head. I would say more, but don't want to spoil it for anyone.In a word, WOW!",Serenity
1457,odbbal,From a non-browncoat,9,9 October 2005,"I saw about two of the episodes of Firefly, both at the beginning, never got into it (time commitments more than lack of interest), and barely remember any of what happened. I have been watching the hype of this film with anticipation, hoping that it would be good. I was a fan of both Buffy and Angel, and any press that Joss ""can't catch a break"" Whedon gets is good for me.So when this was released, I waited until the second weekend to go see it - the fan base for this show was, shall we say, rabid. I waited to hear non-fan praise of the film, but surprisingly, there was very little. Those that hadn't watched the show gave mixed reviews, so I went in with trepidation.I was amazed.Serenity follows the exploits of a space crew on the edge of the frontier of humanity's space exploration doing what they do best - running. They are carrying a passenger that the interplanetary parliament is searching for, for reasons that become apparent very early on. This passenger is a dangerous and disturbed young girl, a psychotic psychic and lethal fighter. What knowledge her psychic abilities have provided to her becomes both a plot point and a vehicle for the theme of the film.There has been a lot of discussion about whether or not non-fans will enjoy the show. I can't speak for everyone, but my father loved it, and he never saw any of the episodes. There is a lot of heavy exposition at the beginning, but if you're paying attention, it's enough. The characters and the interactions between them feel natural, even if they're not fully explored.And I can't say enough about the dialog. One of my little pet peeves is that in most movies people of the future speak and think exactly the same way that we do. In this film, however, the characters have a cultural linguistic all their own. Their speech is heavily sprinkled with Western-style colloquialisms, and the actors - to their immense credit - make it work. It's snappy and unique, and adds a flavor to the universe that other sci-fi movies lack.Jack Green's cinematography perfectly matches the the tone of this film. Serenity is dark and dirty, and he manages to capture the essence of that with every frame. Set design should get props here, too, as nothing in this film seems alive or sterile - deserts and dimly-lit spaceships abound, and a sense of doom pervades every shadow, every frame.Whether or not Serenity becomes a classic film remains to be seen. It's a shining example of the untapped potential that science fiction holds in both pacing and purpose. It's a great film that, hopefully, will preclude a series with these characters whose time, it appears, ended far too early.",Serenity
1458,warlockw,What A Great Movie !,10,2 October 2005,You Need To Go See This Movie .. Its Not Just For SciFi Fans :) Went To See It With The Wife ( Not A SciFi Fan ) She Loved It :)I was very happy with the way they did the movie .. being that i had seen all the TV episodes. They Started from the beginning and definitely gave us some un-answered questions from the TV show!I was truly amazed that they canceled the show .. It Had MANY things that would make for a long running show sex - romance - get special effects - guns - lazers - ships what else do you need ?I am sure hoping this movie does well .. so someone will pickup the show and start running it again!I cannot get enough We Want MORE !!,Serenity
1459,placidekb,Wonderful transition to the big- screen,10,2 October 2005,"Although it's not perfect, Serenity is quite the movie. Joss Whedon does the nearly impossible in satiating the die hard fans of ""Firefly"", and successfully exposing first timers into his vision of the ""verse"" at the same time. There are a few clunky scenes and the effects are not perfect, but thats not the point; with a bigger budget any movie can fill those gaps. Serenity, though, has something most big-budget movies can't buy; a lot of heart. you simply cannot tell me that the stars of ""The Island"" would have made that movie had it not been for a monstrous paycheck. The stars of Serenity surely didn't have that luxury, and perhaps that is what makes this movie so good. It is operating solely on character, impressive dialogue and of course a lot of care from those who are responsible for it.",Serenity
1460,bt40,Deserves to be seen in the theater,10,2 October 2005,"This is the best space opera released since 1977, and you don't have to be sci fi buff to appreciate it. Imagine Star Wars without the hokey parts, populated with realistic characters you care about. Imagine Star Wars without aliens with fish heads or any aliens at all for that matter. Imagine a Star Wars with true wit that makes you laugh out loud. Imagine Star Wars for grown-ups with a real theme that doesn't sound like something you'd find the New Age section of the bookstore. Imagine Star Trek without the Federation knows best big-government mentality. Imagine Star Wars without the royal Jedi blood nonsense. Imagine an sci fi movie where story and character are even more important than the special effects. Imagine a movie that is like a lot things you've seen before, only better.Now, imagine that it's even better than that.",Serenity
1461,toshio-5,The Best Movie I'd Love to Hate,10,2 October 2005,"I so want to hate this movie. Last night I stayed awake making up lists of things I found wrong with it. Like the color of the ship's cargo bay which is bluer than the carefully considered rust tone of the series and the faster timing of the scenes compared to the Firefly TV show. Revisiting my list today, I see that every one of the points is a way in which I feel Serenity didn't live up to the richness embodied by Firefly. Which, with ordinary movies and ordinary television shows would speak volumes about the (lack of) quality in the movie. In this case, however, it shows just what a quality production Firefly, the series, was. It is the best science fiction show since Star Trek redefined science fiction on television. It is what the new Battlestar Galactica aspires to be. And it, a mere television show, is a richer, more satisfying, more intelligent, and yet, *more fun* experience than any of the Star Wars/Star Trek/book-adapted/remake/dumbed down science fiction movies I have dutifully attended in the past twenty-odd years because I knew there was something really spectacular waiting in the wings.Serenity, the movie, comes close. It is the most intelligent recent science fiction movie with the most complex characters. It is also the most real, showing viewers a very human future where things sometimes go your way and sometimes not, a movie that even in triumph has enormous pain. This is a movie that transcends great science fiction and seeks to be great cinema with its faceted, deep peering look into the human condition. Yet I left the theater with a feeling of incredible sadness because, in a very solid way the movie marked the end of the television series.Firefly, not Serenity, is what science fiction on a moving screen has been waiting decades to give birth to. All nine of its developing characters were living, changing entities in a way that Serenity, with its two hours of screen fame could mimic but not match. Although this movie has proved that science fiction movies can explore the fullness of humanity's existence and earns a place for itself, I would trade it for the canceled five seasons of Firefly any day.",Serenity
1462,Devonite,Outstanding movie for fans of Firefly,10,6 October 2005,"I didn't get a chance to see the show in its original release on FOX, but my family and I have caught the episodes of SCIFI Channel and I must admit, We Love Them. The characters and writing are what drew us in and has held us in place. We bought the DVD set and it rivals Farscape, the LOTRs trilogy and the Harry Potter movies being viewed in my house.I was looking forward to seeing the movie very very much and I can honestly say, I was not disappointed.For those of us who are serious fans of the Firefly series the movie was Outstanding. My youngest decided to have the family see Serenity again instead of seeing Corspe Bride and has no interest in seeing the Gromitt movie.For those who are fans of Joss Whedon, he has once again put forth a excellent productFor those who are just SCIFI fans who just want to see a good genre movie, I think you will love it also as long as you enjoy great characters and well written scripts. The interaction between the characters is extraordinary, but I suggest you pay attention to the first 10 - 15 minutes of the movie since that is where you will get the back story.I would love to see another movie. There are a lot of questions that I would love to have answered, but sadly I am not sure that the Box Office will warrant another. If given my druthers I would much rather have FOX sell the rights to the SCIFI Channel and have them give the series a new life.All in all I would suggest this movie to everyone. To use my oldest daughters words. IT ROCKED.",Serenity
1463,armored_seraph,Great for the casual Sci Fi viewer and excellent for the fans.,9,2 October 2005,"To give anyone who's unfamiliar with ""Serenity"" or it's show of origin, ""Firefly"" a summary of the setting of this movie would be as follows. Post Civil War society in space. Showing both the aftermath and the struggles of everyday life and extraordinary circumstances that people in this world face. Add in similar comedic styles used in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" as well as common sense satire of almost any situation and you end up with a film that makes for a fun ride.Lacking politically correct ideals and a non Utopian society is possibly one of the strongest features of both film and series. It's a more gritty, realistic, and rustic approach to the realm of sci fi. I don't remember anyone laughing during most of the sci fi films I've seen in the last year or two, but this one brought both laughter and strong emotions from the audience I was part of. Make no mistake about it, this is not your happy go lucky every character leaves smiling film. To me it seemed based much more on the depth of each individual character. It also relates well to a major problem in most films where characters will do something most consider to be out of character or just plain foolish. These characters do pretty much what any given person in the theaters would wish to do if the shoe were on the other foot. This makes relating to each character portrayed much more easy to do and quickly get one's self drawn into the drama and hardships shown in the film.For those fans that have yet to see the movie and without spoiling anything, the actors did remain true to their characters in the original show. Something for which I have to tip my hat to as TV shows to movie translations usually lose or sacrifice along the way. Not true with this film.I'd rate this a must see for fans of the show and a definite watch for anyone who enjoys a great sci fi movie. My recommendation is to buy a ticket and large popcorn with some friends, get comfy, and enjoy. I hope you all have as much fun watching this film as I did. ;)",Serenity
1464,icepick187,SERENITY is a slap in the face to all FIREFLY fans,3,2 October 2005,"I have to begin with one little side note: This is, in actuality, a pretty good movie. The reason for my low rating is the fact that this film bears none but the most superficial resemblance to its source material, one of the greatest shows of all time.SERENITY starts out with some action and a caper, staples of FIREFLY. From that point, however, the story and the characters cease to be those that we all know and love. Despite the fact that the credits point to Joss Whedon, creator of this series, as director and writer of this movie, I wondered at more than one point if the person responsible for this film had EVER watched an episode of the series. The interpersonal relationships-gone. Trademark humor-gone. Intelligent and unexpected plotting-gone. All you end up with is a decent sci-fi movie forced over an existing template with a result of the destruction of both. This movie changed backstory, ignored the essential story lines laid down in the series, and made a few disturbing and irreversible changes to the crew.I love FIREFLY. I raged when it was cancelled. I cheered when I saw the DVD set with the additional episodes and correct ordering. The announcement of the film excited me greatly. Now, I just wish I could go back and un-watch this film, leaving the crew of my beloved Serenity as they were.",Serenity
1465,xilfrix,Shiny shiny shiny!!!,10,2 October 2005,"Browncoats, this is a truly excellent work to help answer some of the questions left after ruttin FOX, in their gorram stupidity, canceled Firefly. You will be hanging on the edge of your seats as you get to see some of the most memorable characters from the realm of TV sci-fi keep flying. The flick is truly shiny, and well worth the price of admission.For those who are unfamiliar with the original series, there is plenty of entertainment for you as well. The film is made with you all in mind, giving some of the back-story we die hard fans know all too well from countless viewings of the far too few television episodes which were produced.The sfx are incredible, as one would expect, and the storyline is solid. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll gasp in disbelief and you'll have to restrain yourself from standing and saying ""Hell yes!"" in the middle of the theater (though you would surely not be alone if you did).For the parents, there really isn't any bad language in the film (well, there isn't any bad language in English at any rate). As far as violence, if you let your kids see the Lord of the Rings trilogy, then they will probably be safe to see this one (unless you make the distinction about the use of firearms in sci-fi versus swords and bows in fantasy). There are sexual overtones and references, but no nudity, so that should not be an issue either. Still, with all that said, parents may still want to go see the film before giving the green light to younger kids. {No no, this was not a shameless ploy to get the box office revenues up by making parents go watch it before saying it's OK for their kids. Really. :) }",Serenity
1466,aarrrrrrg,See this movie!,10,2 October 2005,"What an effing great movie! I had minimum expectations and went to see it mainly because the previews made it look like a fairly decent science fiction space action adventure--which it certainly is--but that's all I thought it would be. It turns out to have a fantastic mix of action, futurism, humor, heart and humanity. I was particularly pleased to see Ron Glass in a very nice role. The plot also surprised me, which almost never happens; I didn't see the conclusion coming in the way it came together. That made it even more fun. I never heard of the series, ""Firefly,"" from which the movie was derived before searching for info on the movie, so I knew nothing about it beforehand. I was so pleasantly surprised. See this movie!",Serenity

I may even go see it again this weekend coming up.I have not seen much of the television show but now I'm going to see if I can pick up the DVD.The dialog was top, the effects had my jaw on the floor, and the acting was superb (sp? meh).Nothing in the movie happened the way you expected it to, it was all fresh and new =)I cant wait to own this movie. and i would recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in the subject matter.-Wayne",Serenity
1468,daniel-811,SERENITY is an absolutely amazing movie!,10,2 October 2005,"People, I cannot possibly say this enough. This movie is unbelievable! It's got everything - intensity, action, terrific characters, great special effects, and wit.Even if you're not a fan of the TV show Firefly, upon which it is based, or haven't heard of it until now, go see it. You owe it to yourself. This is easily one of the finest stories ever to grace the silver screen. Joss Whedon is a genius for creating a universe this distinct and unique.Existing fans of Firefly will find a great many of their questions answered, and at the same time see many gateways and futures open up for the crew of Serenity.If you're not a fan yet, you'll find plenty about Serenity to like. It's a refreshing departure from the rest of the sci-fi out there now. It is like a hybrid western/sci-fi movie. How could it not be awesome? Need I say anything more? Go see it.",Serenity
1469,janasjunk,Loved it !!!!!!!!!!!,10,2 October 2005,"I followed the program on TV and was GREATLY disappointed when it was canceled. Bought the DVD's when they came out. Was extremely happy when I discovered a movie was being done. Now that I've seen the movie, I can only hope they continue making more. The film answered many questions from the series. I am sorry for some happenings, but that's what makes a story. Having all the same characters return added to the follow through from the TV program. And while that was great for someone whom had followed the program on TV, this was a movie that stood/stands on its own as a feature film. It was funny, exciting, sad and one of the best movies I've seen.The rest of the audience thought so too. It received a standing ovation , do not see that very often at the theater !! Thanks Joss and crew for a job well done !!!!",Serenity
1470,lewis-70,"Not high art, but highly entertaining.",10,2 October 2005,"I went to this movie with high hopes, having recently seen numerous episodes of the Firefly on Sci-fi. I was not disappointed at all. It is the best action film that I have seen this year. I liked it so much that I saw it again the next day with more people. The plot is fairly thick, yet moves quickly and there is very little wasted time in this 2 hour movie. I was glued to the screen, it was pure escapism. I had a blast. Not since the first Matrix film have I had this much fun at the theater watching a sci-fi film. I highly recommend this if you are looking for a good action film.This is a funny movie. It has great dramatic timing and great comedic timing. It's just a fun film. Not high art, but highly entertaining.",Serenity
1471,kangarulz,Brilliant,10,2 October 2005,"If you want to watch a film with great writing, smart storytelling, good acting, along with fun, excitement, tears, and a good laugh go see this film. Even if you are not a science fiction fan, and you hated Star Wars, the problems and emotions these characters face are universal. The crew from Serenity will take you on a ride you'll be thinking about for a very long time, (and not in a creepy bad movie way). The film is based on a television series that only ran for a total of 14 episodes, but it's not crucial that you watch these before the film. You maybe find however the experience more familiar and enjoyable if you do.",Serenity
1472,rhythwyn,Preview,10,2 October 2005,"If you loved ""Firefly"", you'll love this movie. The script stays true to what the show started. The story picks up at a short point beyond the ending of the series. It took a little to get used to it being on a big screen and seemed to hiccup at first in the flow but the storyline quickly smoothed out and was rolling along. There are a few quiet moments that could be seen as a little boring to those looking for nonstop action but they were well placed and timed. The audience I was with tonight laughed and almost cheered at times and I left the theatre feeling energized and excited. This is one movie I will gladly watch over and over.",Serenity
1473,papamanjr,great,10,3 October 2005,"action, wit, heart, and a good measure of but-kicking; that's what you'll get with this film. if you've seen the show and are a fan, you'll love it; if you haven't, you're in for a treat. Serenity is a film that doesn't try to sugar coat things all the time, which is something that we just haven't seen in sci-fi movies in a long while. it's funny when it needs to be, serious as a heart attack when it has to be, and just politically witty enough to make those that realize it smile, and entertaining enough for the rest of them not to care . but the greatest part about this movie though is that it isn't perfect - and it probably wasn't meant to be. what it is though, is the closest thing to a good new star wars movie we'll probably ever get to see.",Serenity
1474,spartekus,Incredible.,10,2 October 2005,"Having grown up as a Trekkie and fallen in love with well-developed characters and creative technology of sci-fi, this movie was incredible. Saw it twice this weekend.Having never heard of Whedon or the Firefly TV series, I had no idea what to expect coming into the theater. Blew me away. I bought the DVD's of the series tonight on Amazon.I agree with some of the other comments that you have to understand some of the quick witty humor and find yourself interested in the technology and details to really get the most out of the movie.I highly recommend it.",Serenity
1475,darin98011,Like a smart movie with plenty of action? Go see SERENITY.,10,3 October 2005,"I haven't seen a better flick in longer than I can remember. This movie has great dialog, smooth editing, beautiful action choreography, clean lighting, and the acting...these are characters you care about. The story line is involved and detailed enough to encompass quite a range of sets and characters without getting bogged down in minutia. All this with a realistic antagonist & a fairly clean sci-fi backdrop. SERENITY is a home run. To all who worked on this movie I'd like to send a heartfelt THANK YOU. Oh, and by the way, I had never heard of FIREFLY until now, but I'm definitely looking for buddies with it recorded...I can see becoming a fan if this movie is indicative of the quality of the TV show.",Serenity
1476,eamonwyse,Awesome Movie,10,7 October 2005,"Serenity is superb. Joss Whedon has successfully transfered Firefly to the big screen and in doing so has creating one of the best Sci-Fi movies I've seen in a long, long while. For fans of Joss or Firefly, it's obviously a must, but for those who have never seen the TV series it's just as thrilling. Even for the non Sci-Fi fans, it's an action-packed watch (Believe me...my better half is NOT a sci-fi fan, but she loves Firefly and Serenity!) and the characters will grow on you instantly, from Capt. Malcolm Reynolds to River Tam, each cast member provides their own brand of humour to the proceedings, providing clever and welcome breaks from the drama. The action sequences are great too, both during the fight scenes and space battles. I cannot wait to see this movie again.Must-see for both Sci-Fi and non Sci-Fi fans alike.",Serenity
1477,bob_o_matic,Great Movie,10,3 October 2005,"Great Movie, although I am a fan of the series from which this is derived, so my opinion may be considered biased. If I was to comment on my favorite aspect of the movie, it would be its refusal to sit in any recognised genre, and amusing use of 'anti clichés' One point that may not sit well with audiences is the TV feeling of this movie. The Movie, although it looks like a feature presentation feels like a T.V. show in the sense of an on-going story... a brilliant and engaging T.V. show, but still a T.V. show. That said, if it didn't have that feeling of small part of a larger story I doubt I would have enjoyed it as much. I truly hope others who are not fans of Firely can appreciate this movie, and are compelled enough to watch the series after seeing the movie. Kudos to Joss Whedon and his team for yet again providing us with such a high standard of entertainment, may his good work continue.",Serenity
1478,dmmoore3,Perfect Blend,10,3 October 2005,"Perfect blend of action, comedy, romance and drama. A great date film as it has something for everyone. Even if you haven't seen the series, the movie does a great job of character development. I have seen the series and I loved the way all of the same actors were used (I wasn't disappointed about anything). We went with a couple who had never even heard of the series and they were begging to borrow our DVD set of the series when the ride was over. I never buy movies on DVD because I rarely want to see them twice. This one, I WILL buy! Go see it on the big screen... it is worth every minute and ever dollar.",Serenity
1479,b47griggs,Very good - almost great,9,3 October 2005,"I loved the movie; fell in love with all the people during the TV series. I think every one of the actors interpreted their characters perfectly - and Summer Glau was simply amazing in the series. My only problem with the movie is that someone unfamiliar with the original TV series might not have enough information to really appreciate the various relationships. I know it's difficult to explore people's characters in the short time a movie has, but I would have preferred more relationship exposition and less fighting. But this is an action movie, I guess, so I shouldn't have expected anything else. I'm really hoping Serenity does well enough for either many sequels or a return to series television - with better promotion and support this time.",Serenity
1480,jbrackett-1,Amazingly good movie!,10,3 October 2005,"I was not one of the many loyal fans of the show when it first came out. In fact, I never watched an episode until it recently started running on cable recently. However, after only three episodes I was so impressed that I went out and bought the entire series on DVD. Watched every episode & then showed it to various friends and family. Without exception, each person I have loaned the DVD to has become hooked, and everyone has the same question: ""Why did they cancel this show?""Spoiler below: Now for the movie. It was great to see the crew together again. The witty dialog, the realistic mixture of sarcasm, humor, and anger in stressful situations. All in all, great writing - great acting. In addition, Joss Whedon had the cojones to do that which adds a touch of realism to any story. He showed that the heroes were not invincible. He killed off main characters! (gasp) Whether this was due to contract issues, commitment concerns, scheduling conflicts, or whatever else doesn't matter. It added a touch of realism that has always been lacking from series based movies (i.e. Paramount). For those who want the gritty bite of reality in their sci-fi, go see this amazing film!",Serenity
1481,jeni_a_m,Serenity Rocks!,10,3 October 2005,"Joss is brilliant!!! Serenity is brilliant. Very rarely does a show make a smooth transition from small screen to big screen, but Joss did it flawlessly. If you love the series, it's everything you hope it would be. Lots of background details without too much recap of what's already been covered. If you've never seen the show, you can still follow along and enjoy the movie, but I think you get a lot more out of it if you know the history. So go buy the series DVD and support the show. This is an awesome cast and they should be able to keep working together. Will someone please, please, please bring back this series!! Please?",Serenity
1482,KaatjeEster,There's no place I'd rather be...,10,3 October 2005,"There is no hope for any quality television series at all, without Josh Whedon. My theory is that he writes and produces for people who've been outsiders all their life. Josh Whedon shows plucky, feisty heroes who are outsiders yet have found an adventurous gang. I do not have TV at home, but rent any Josh Whedon series through Netflix, and I ended up buying the Firefly series. There are no other TV shows or movies that have given me this much hope and inspiration. The movie Serenity's only flaw is that the beautiful, melancholic, catchy title song from the series is nowhere to be heard. My husband and I loved the movie, saw it last night and we will see it again, and then some more at the dollar show. ""There's no place I'd rather be than on Serenity...""",Serenity
1483,hj7767,Wouldn't watch it a second time,4,4 December 2005,"Given the fact that there are so many 10 votes, I suppose one needs to know the series to be able to understand the film. I might have rated it better if I had that background; But my opinion is that a film should not be made based on the assumption that people watching it, will have a background, before they see the film. The plot is without surprises and leaves a lot of questions open, that in an average movie I would expect being explained. In my opinion just another B-movie, worth watching if you can spare the time. The film was not able make enough appetite for watching the series, neither would I watch the series trying to get answers for the open questions, I have.",Serenity

As a frequenter of the Sunnydale set, I was happy to see that same sect of scoobyesqness in the cast of Firefly and of course disappointed when Fox didn't let the show get its legs.Thanks to Joss & Universal for giving those characters their chance to shine. My non BTVS crew said they'd totally see a sequel.I also loved seeing the same gritty overlit flashback style of BTVS too.Kudos! Can't wait to see how Joss'll translate another fave, Princess Diana of Thymescera (aka Wonder Woman) on film.",Serenity
1485,mercywallis,"High-speed action, quite the ride",10,3 October 2005,"This was an excellent, action-packed, emotionally gripping film. I adored the series, and was a bit worried over some of the advance news from folks who'd seen preview screenings; but start to finish, from the breathless opening sequence to the satisfying conclusion, I had *nothing* to worry about.The acting is top-notch, the sets are amazingly detailed, the story reads both as original, and familiar. It felt like falling right back into the 'verse I'd known and loved. The action is liberally salted with humor, we get a *much* better feeling of the star system in which the Alliance and the remnants of the Browncoat Independents live, and why the War happened in the first place. Several questions that were teasing the fans were answered; some weren't, and weren't *deliberately*. And the rich mingling of ethnic cultures is seen in force, all the places the movie shows us.All in all, my recommendation, for what it's worth? Go see it. Then go see it again. :)",Serenity
1486,arithiesse,This movie is top notch! : ),10,3 October 2005,"I've unfortunately never heard of this series, or books, before I watched this movie, but I was amazed! This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. In the days when the last of the Star Wars movies have died out and lost their meaning, along with the long absence of an Indiana Jones movie, this movie is inspiring, beautiful, and the acting was very much first rate! It definitely has a deeply profound effect on the moviegoer. Its message is so well placed and comes across with a subtlety that you are left with a sense of happiness and warmth inside. perhaps even a sense of hope for mankind, and yet when you look back you're not even sure why! I especially loved the ( hope not to spoil it ) part with the captian near the end asking ""you know what the first rule of flying is?"" I remember when I first soloed in a small cessna, and I had two different instructors, one who would be very calm and laid back, ate his lunch with his feet propped up on the dash : )P ( a lot like the captain in this movie ) and then when he found a commercial job elsewhere I was stuck with a by the book ""you need to memorize 385 pages of this manual before our next lesson"" kind of guy! : )P The former always knew what to do and kept his cool, and the later well he just about lost it when anything ""not in the book"" would arise. Oh well! never mind my stories, go see this great movie, this one is sure to be a classic!",Serenity
1487,justshiny,awesome,10,3 October 2005,I loved firefly the television show and this movie was amazing. It was original and not predictable which is a rare find in movies now a days. You feel like you know the characters you feel for their pain and there happiness even if you didn't watch the television show. It was beautifully acted and all the characters have depth and add a good essence to the plot line. Many things that happened took me by surprise and the movie was better for it. It is an emotional journey with a little laughing then crying then both at the same time. Joss Whedon's visions of the future in this movie are unlike others and it is very believable. The computer effects are not overused and what was used looks to be real.,Serenity
1488,adgraham,A fantastic movie,10,3 October 2005,"My friends and I have been to see the film 4 times, and each time we liked it more! Word is starting to get around about how good Serenity is, and I suspect I'll be taking more friends next weekend!Serenity is the gateway to a rich world of drama, action, and comedy. Inspired by a TV show made popular by impressive DVD sales, Serenity offers two hours of roller-coaster action, with the payoff being more than a dozen more hour-long TV episodes that you can go back and enjoy on DVD.See the movie, then watch the show! Seen the show? Watch the movie!Everyone wins!",Serenity

It was seriously extraordinarily clever,and truly never boring. I gasped, and laughed through out the whole thing, you don't have to have known anything about the ""Firefly"" series prior to seeing the movie. I had no prior knowledge of the series minus the fact that it had existed once, but was canceled and that, that what was the movie was based off of. This movie isn't concerned with attempting to impress the entirety of the global population, oh no, it's about being a good movie. I'm now totally hooked on this whole series, and quite upset it's off the air. Here's hoping that there is a sequel.",Serenity
1490,ckurumada,Serenity is terrific!,10,3 October 2005,"I found the film ""Serenity"" everything I expected from a full-length film by Joss Whedon. First, I'm a big fan of Whedonesque humor and storyline. A longtime fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, I became addicted to Firefly over the summer of 2005. I found the film ""Serenity"" a great mix of action, humor and suspense which tied up many (but, by no means, all) story lines of the original series. Some of the scary parts are pretty damn scary! My hope is that the series will return with many new adventures for the crew. I think the characters, story and direction were all top-notch. Humor inserted at just the right spots, thrilling moments kept me watching rather than closing my eyes, all of the elements of this film made it a thoroughly enjoyable experience. But, I'm prejudiced.Craig in ArcataCraig",Serenity
1491,cixzeven,Saw it two days ago! Then again Yesterday! Now Waiting for Part 2,10,3 October 2005,"Loved this movie. The storyline was solid. I would recommend watching the show ""Firefly"", which this movie is based on in order to enjoy the movie more thoroughly yet the movie stands fine on its own for those who have never seen a show. I could only catch a few episodes on the Sci-Fi Channel recently. The cast seems to blend in together real well, nothing seemed forced it was a smooth ride all the way. I would really enjoy it if the story could evolve from this movie, maybe into a part 2, or even a continued showing on TV. I would love to see these characters on an ongoing basis. I know I haven't talked much about the actual movie here; that's so you'll go and see it.",Serenity
1492,ericmcasper,Joss Whedon does it again,10,13 October 2005,"One of the best movies I have ever seen. Even if you did not see the series, the conflicts and raw human emotions are very intense and very grabbing. As much as it satisfies the fans of the series, it really is a self contained movie that stands on its own as outstanding entertainment. I truly hope that it does well enough for us to see future movies or someone picking this up as a TV series again. Frankly, I think it works even better on the big screen, but I really hope we have not seen the end of the Firefly universe. I am a big Joss Whedon fan. As much as I loved Buffy (tv, not the terrible movie) and Angel (particularly the last seasons of each), this tops an thing else I have seen him do. Not only is this a must see for Whedon fans (which is probably to nobodies surprise), this is a film any science fiction fan should miss. It brought back discussions when I was an undergraduate and took a class called ""Political Theory in Science Fiction.""",Serenity
1493,mairek,The signal never ended!!!,10,3 October 2005,"As a big sci-fi fan for many years,( live long and prosper, insert hand gesture,) I have been anticipating this film for a year or more. I was not let down, see, you don't need big name stars to make a movie work. This movie is not the ""new star wars"" its better!!! The movie made me cry and laugh, and then I laughed till I cried. I gasped with shock so many times I nearly hyperventilated!!! This story started with a great series that was canceled and was never given a chance, well Joss Whedon has proved everyone wrong!!!! This great little band of characters will live on!!!! There are many more stories to this 'verse that need telling, and Whedon deserves the Gorram right to tell 'em!!!!",Serenity
1494,wshapard,Whedon Takes Scifi to New Artistic Heights,10,3 October 2005,"Serenity employs an ingenious opening sequence to catch up viewers who are uninitiated in the Firefly 'verse, and then, in the words of River Tam, ""I know. We're going for a ride."" A thrilling ride. As in his other work, Joss Whedon uses an intricate mix of genres, high drama, action, mystery, humor, and character driven plot to draw the viewer into his world, and then keep the audience on the edge of their seats for the next two hours. Serenity is scifi for the thinking person, where the knuckle-whitening action is there to serve the development of its characters, and the laugh out loud moments let you catch your breath almost in time to gasp in shock. At the same time, the story works on the deeper level of analogy important to all great scifi, commenting on the human need for freedom, for family, for something to believe in, and the willingness of heroes to sacrifice themselves for those ideals. Whedon weaves these threads throughout his story, and then trusts his audience to be able to enjoy the action and the deeper significance at the same time. Truly, a rare cinematic treat.",Serenity
1495,pcstevens-1,Serenity soars on love,10,3 October 2005,"Whoa! I came out of the theatre with numb hands cuz I forgot to breathe! I am a Firefly fan so I am writing as someone already familiar with the characters and the 'verse, but I do believe that Joss handled the 'exposition' for newbies with a great deal of creativity -- hardly even exposition as it also served as character development as well -- one of Joss' many strengths.And oh, how I adore the crew of Serenity, flaws and all! This ship flies because of love -- these actors love their ship and it shows. Plus, how often do we get to see a film that actually has real people in it! The awesome part of giving this story to the medium of film, is that it seemed to give it more momentum, so the action side of this multi-genred endeavor greatly benefited. I'm still reeling! Thanks Joss!!! I love my Cap'n.",Serenity
1496,billhanna,Bring it back,10,8 October 2006,"I strongly advise you follow the advice given to me by the people who turned me on to this series/movie. They said to watch the series (Firefly) before the movie.That said, I believe the movie stands well on it's own. I really like the mix of western and sci-fi. The characters are well developed and when a death occurs, their loss is deeply felt.That only bad thing was the feeling we felt when we had finished watching them all (Twice). It was the same feeling that inspired Led Zeppelin to write ""Bring it back, bring it back."" after they read the trilogy (JRR Tolken).",Serenity
1497,wingmanxan,An Excellent movie,10,3 October 2005,"This is an excellent movie and I do not know why the TV series did no take off. Joss Whedon has worked his magic and woven a masterpiece and although no one in the movie was anyone that had been in many famous movies they were very good for their parts. The only bad part about it was the ending. I am not saying the ending was bad but the fact that the movie ended. It was a fabulous film, and really there could have been only one improvement. An extended length of the film which can always be made up in a second film and if the film is successful enough perhaps even a third, and with the high ratings of this film that is a high likeliness. I rated this film 10/10 and i hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",Serenity
1498,vampire-in-mainz,An awesome piece of Sci-Fi Western,9,4 October 2005,"OK this Film is one of the best Sci-Fi Movies I have seen in a long while. It is definitely better than all 3 new STARWARS Movies together. Joss Whedon made this incredible leap from a TV Series in a full fledged Space-movie. It looses a bit of its wild-west feeling but he makes up for that with incredible character-work, a good story and a good mix of genres. I am especially fond of the villain, the operative. Whedon created a frustrating calm and intellectual agent/hit-man to oppose Mal and his crew. He is a strong and near undefeatable openest without delusions about his goals and his position in this universe, his only problem is that he is a bit overconfident. The only pity is, they still don't give away Books secret!!! Now I fear we never will know.",Serenity
1499,amylis,Amazing Characters,10,6 October 2005,"I can't say enough about this movie. Being a fan of the Firefly series I already knew the characters and the basic storyline, so I was more than thrilled to finally be able to see these amazing characters again. Folks who were not Firefly fans have been to see the movie and loved it. So, it hit the mark all the way around. I've seen it twice so far and plan on seeing it again as many times as I can before it leaves the theater. And I can't wait for the DVD to come out. If there is a God, there will be sequels. Maybe even a franchise. But the best of all worlds would be for this to be a series again where we can really spend time with these amazing characters.",Serenity
1500,catvanb,Best movie ever made based on a TV series,10,4 October 2005,"I was looking forward to a nice continuation of Firefly. I got instead a great plot, character expansion, humor, special effects, and the advantage of the big screen to make it all seem bigger than life.. I found myself so involved in the story that I was talking aloud to the characters...and no one else in the theater seemed to mind. They were too enthralled to notice. I recommend this movie not just to Firefly and sci-fi fans, but to anyone who loves a good story with sympathetic characters, surprises, heart and soul. Firefly was good-Serenity is betterNow, Joss---do it again!",Serenity
1501,Dragonballmania2,actually lives up to its hype,10,4 October 2005,"I've heard a lot of hype about movies in the past, and they fail to live up to expectations. Serenity, a relatively cheap movie based off a cancelled TV show, has had an amazing amount of hype. To me, it more then lives up to it.The person I went to see it with tonight knew NOTHING about Firefly, and she loved it and understood what was going on. I could say more, but those would be spoilers. In all honesty i'll probably do the same thing with Serenity as i did with Revenge of the Sith......and thats see it enough times in theaters so i'm content until the DVD comes out next year.",Serenity
1502,gingrich-16,Excellent work of Story Telling,10,20 December 2005,"I have to start this out by admitting that I'm a Firefly fan - my friends might say ""fanatic""...and they might be right, too. But I'm such a huge fan for a reason. Joss Whedon tells good stories, plain and simple.Whedon is probably one of the best storytellers I've seen in the entertainment industry in a long time. His characters are deep, with personalities you can identify with in such a way that you either end up loving them to death, or hating them with a fiery passion. His plots are interesting at the very least, and usually are absolutely fascinating. The only possible downside to the movie is that it may seem a little predictable. But for having to cram about 3 or 4 seasons worth of material into a 2 hour time frame, this is a herculean effort that produced staggeringly wonderful results.The movie is not all special effects as the trailers and commercial spots showed. It is definitely not like most movies being produced in this day and age! The movie has a lot of effects, being Science Fiction that's necessary; but the plot isn't *driven* by the effects or the action. The plot is driven by the characters, and the very nature of what they value in the universe.Serenity is a story of a ship full of heroes. Not heroes in the classical ""flawless perfection"" sense, but heroes in a gritty down-to-earth way. Every single one of them has their flaws (some more than others), but they keep fighting despite them. These are the kinds of heroes a person can identify with, or idolize because they're realistic and human. They're the people you could imagine meeting on the street one day.I've encouraged just about everyone I know to go see this movie. I've convinced around 30 people to watch it - and I've yet to hear a bad review out of any of them. A number loved it so much they went to see it more than once! Many of them had never seen the Firefly TV series.I can't encourage you enough to pick up a copy of the movie and give it a try. I honestly believe you'll be pleasantly surprised by what you find.",Serenity
1503,roys44,Great finish for Firefly,9,4 October 2005,"Like most of the people posting comments here I liked the movie a lot. For me though, it was a great finish to an average series,(Firefly). I didn't start watching Firefly until a few months ago on Scifi. I wasn't that impressed with it at first but kept watching it anyway. Some episodes were a lot better than others. When I first saw the movie advertised, I wondered why they would make a movie of an,(to me), average show. Then I saw that the reviews were pretty good and made plans to see it. I rarely go to the theater anymore because I am usually disappointed. Episode 3 comes to mind. Anyway, I went in not having high expectations, but wanting to see how the characters were doing. I was pleasantly surprised. If this was the end I would be happy. If another was made, I'm sure I would go and see it, but I have my doubts it would be as good. I would recommend that to get maximum enjoyment from this movie you should first try to see a few Firefly episodes. This is a movie where the characters matter more than the special effects.",Serenity
1504,patchwrk,Exactly what the sci-fi film genre was in desperate need of...,10,5 October 2005,"Serenity is a prime example of what a director can do with an established set of characters, and even a small existing fanbase. I believe it will be used from this point forward as a reference for everything that Lucas COULD have done right with the continuance of the Star Wars franchise. Whedon took a television series that was doomed by the airing network (How many spots did you ever see for Firefly?), built an incredibly devote (though sparse)fanbase, and brought the universe over to film flawlessly. He displayed the fact that a well written, well directed character does not need a long, plot-dragging backstory exposition on screen... as in real life, the interaction _between_ the characters, and their reactions to the events that surround them are indicative of all that an audience needs to know to determine just who that person is, and whether to empathize or wish the worst upon them. The story flows smoothly throughout the entire film, never stopping to a point where a viewer's interest would wane, but never turning into a digitally rendered sensory overload. The effects are superb, the dialog is consistently witty and well conveyed, the action sequences are far more engaging than any film I've seen in quite awhile, and the overall impression one leaves the theater with is quite satisfying. Here's hoping this marks the beginning of a new, and long-lived franchise.",Serenity
1505,geoppingerj,Serenity is the first must see of fall!,9,5 October 2005,"For fans of the sci-fi and action genres, Serenity has it all: nail-biting suspense, wit, and explosive action that only supplement a unique universe. Not only for fans of the series it is based on, Serenity delivers what other not-to-be-mentioned-here films have been unable to do this year. The characterization of the main players make them immediately likable, if not relatable, and the CGI supports the story and action, rather than overwhelm the viewer. The shaky camera work and zoom-in style add a personal charm to the film, rather than detract. The only thing that keeps me from giving Serenity a 10 out of 10 is the minor characters -some of their personalities are lost by having to fit into a two-hour time frame. If this film makes it to a sequel, I would enjoy seeing further characterization of some of those characters that had to take aback seat for the sake of time. However, take the time to see this movie, and then see it again!",Serenity
1506,rinfo,Bravo Serenity,10,5 October 2005,"About a year ago I rented the first DVD of the Firefly 4 DVD set from netflix on a whim. After watching the first couple episodes I immediately went online and ordered the 4 DVD set from Amazon.com. My wife, kids and myself have been fans ever since. Serenity has met and passed my expectations. The Firefly/Serenity series is a fresh and unsanitized look at a vision of the future that has become all too stereotyped by extrapolating from the Star Trek and Star Wars movies. One thing you'll notice (or not notice) in this move is there are no ""space aliens"". I loved the original 3 Star Wars movies, Original Star Trek series, and Star Trek TNG mostly because it was largely about the characters set in interesting future settings and situations. Even though I've always been a Si-Fi fan, all the later movies and TV episodes of a similar nature of a crew on a ship or space station (Deep Space 9 and beyond, plus the new Star Wars) have been a disappointment to me. The Firefly series and Serenity are a fresh look at the future and a lot of fun. Given human nature as it is, Firefly is probably a closer look at our future colonization of space than most of the other Star Trek and Star Wars movies. I find the characters likable, the vision of the future interesting, and overall just plain good entertainment. Bravo!",Serenity
1507,mdasef,Loved the Series,10,5 October 2005,"And was not disappointed in the least by the movie. I'd love to have them start the series up again. Let's see I need 10 lines of text. Okay, the effects were good enough for suspension of disbelief, which is a required element of good SF. Can the movie make the watcher forget that this is just a movie? Well, maybe not all the time, but just enough to allow the watcher to get totally immersed. This movie did it. The audience when we attended laughed a lot and applauded several times in the movie and at the end. To me that shows a pretty much universal ""I like this movie."" Go see it if you haven't yet. I recommend it for all audiences, though it's a bit scary for little kids in some places. It also does contain quite a bit of spilled blood.",Serenity
1508,hackettphoto,Joss Whedon is my scriptwriting hero,10,6 October 2005,"I had been a fan of Firefly when it was on Fox and was really excited when SciFi picked it up. So of course I had to see the movie. I loved the movie. I hope to see it again on the big screen and buy the DVD when it comes out. I hope there is a sequel or they revive the weekly show. I want to see these characters again soon. Especially Mal without his shirt on. I was however deeply saddened by the demise of 2 key characters. One I could understand but both, not so much. Overall the special bond the crew shares is reminiscent of the similar bonding on Angel and Buffy. The great one-liners are still in my head too. Joss Whedon is my scriptwriting hero.",Serenity
1509,estokely,Joss W is amazing,10,16 October 2005,"Loved Buffy the Series, watched Angel which was almost as good. Firefly was a great show. Scifi channel brought it back. OK enough of this. The Movie was great. It followed the characters perfectly. Yes, watching Wash getting killed was brutal but as I watched that sense and those that followed I kept thinking how hard it is to portray ""the noble death"" correctly. When I was convinced the entire crew was doomed I felt it, it hurt knowing they wouldn't survive. And then Jayne said ""Well, I might"" when asked if they thought any of them would survive. And I was a little better.See the movie twice and get the DVD. Mainly because I would like to see more of the crew, the ship, of Joss. And frankly, its all about me.Enjoy",Serenity
1510,mil0ve,a true roller-coaster ride,10,5 October 2005,"When i watched an interview with one of the cast, and he said it was going to be a roller-coaster ride of a movie, I didn't exactly believe him. However, when I saw Serentiy, I realized he wasn't lying. I was on the edge of my seat, cried quite a bit, and laughed more than a few times. It had twists and turns that i din't see coming, and my friends and I have been talking about then for days. The shots of space flight and battles were very well done, and made you feel confused, excited and scared for the characters. The villain is great, the heroes are excellent, and even the bit players are unique and interesting. I truly hope there are sequels, because this could be the next great sci-fi franchise. The thing we've all been looking for in the absence of intelligent, and fun movies (i.e. the last 3 Star Wars movies). This is a must see movie!!",Serenity

It's funny, exciting, interesting and the fight scenes are cool. Even my dad liked it, wand he usually doesn't like movies like this. the one liners in it are great and its got some jumpy scenes it, which i like very much.If your a fan of Buffy or Angel or kiss ass movies and you haven't seen 'serenity' yet, you really should. you wont regret it.

1512,jszostaksr,Superb Sci-Fi Film!,10,6 October 2005,"'Serenity' is simply superb Sci-Fi. Well written story with an excellent plot which never leaves you asking for more explanation because it unfolds in such a natural manner. It leads you on not only as Sci-Fi...but good mystery as well.The special effects certainly are as good as if not better than Lucas Films effects. I found them simply amazing! Quite visceral and heart pounding.The acting is also outstanding. I found myself believing in all of the characters...no matter how outrageous. Character development has never been any better than here.One small continuity problem though. I won't mention just what exactly as it would be a spoiler. But it involves blood on the face of the Captain...which appears...then disappears...and appears later as the movie progresses. Can you find it?I highly recommend this film for those who enjoy Sci-Fi and Mystery.Jon E. Szostak, Sr.",Serenity
1513,nix-36,Great movie. Worth a watch.,9,6 October 2005,"I am a fan of firefly and was really looking forward to this movie. It didn't disappoint. It was worth a visit to the cinema and I definitely recommend it to all. If you like Buffy or Angel and you enjoy Joss Whedons sense of humour then you will love this movie - if you don't like Buffy and you don't appreciate Joss Whedons sense of humour then go and see another Die Hard/lethal weapon type same old flick instead as you will probably not appreciate this. It is totally original and is a new spin on sci-fi. It is just what true sci-fi fans have been waiting for. Myself and my boyfriend are going again - probably several times just to support the cause and maybe one day we will have justice and see firefly back on our screens. Nicky, Surrey, England",Serenity
1514,shyla30494-1,Congratulations to Joss Whedon!,8,6 October 2005,"Joss Whedon has had a lot of success. I have loved everything that I've seen him work on. Even back to his help in the show Roseanne, you may not be aware but he was a writer for some of those episodes. His big success was when Buffy hit, I watched all 7 years and now own them all on DVD. It was sad to see it end. But we had Angel to look to, also something I watched from day 1 and now own. Both of these shows were huge and brought in those networks a lot of money. A few years after Angel started, he created Firefly, something totally different and unique. The characters were amazing and he kept his style with his quick witted humor. Before it could even finish that was cancelled and a few years later the same fate fell to Angel. Two incredible shows, I know firefly didn't have the best ratings, but wasn't due to the show, I think mainly due to night and time. But at the time Angel was cancelled it was one of, if not the highest rated show on that channel. I know how upset the fans were, I can't imagine how he felt.I just wanted to say that I think it's great that Mr Whedon is still making a success out of Firefly. He had a great idea and it worked, he realized that and now is making the most of it. So many have purchased the season of Firefly on DVD and now he has created this movie. And depending on how well it does from what I've read he'd like to do more. (Not sure how true that is.) Mr. Whedon is truly a success and I know I have enjoy all the laughs from his shows, gave me as well as others a lot of great times. He is definitely a talented individual and I look forward to any new upcoming productions he may have in mind.Thanks!",Serenity
1515,catcherpro22,Joss Whedon's Vission Come Alive,10,23 June 2006,"Joss Whedon's vision come alive. It shows the extraordinary writing skills of Whedon along with the amazing effort of all cast and crew involved. The cast performed beautifully, melding their characters like they truly were these people they portray. The use of camera zooms and focuses really makes you feel like you are right there in the thick of all the action. It is so well written that you really can't anticipate what Joss Whedon's story is going to do next. This new chapter in the Firefly saga allows for newcomers to be immersed in the story while allowing the veterans of the original series to find renewal in this amazing story. Gives optimism that this incredible narrative can one day be resurrected. The movie renews your enthusiasm for the series and makes you believe that once you go to Serenity you really never leave, you just learn to live there.",Serenity
1516,reillyriv,Well worth the wait,9,6 October 2005,"***Zero Spoilers***Having waited for what seemed an eternity to see this movie, I was impressed with how much bigger the characters were. All had something to say, and something to offer to the plot. In the months following the end of the TV series, Simon Tam appears to have finally grown a pair, while Malcolm Reynolds appears to be closer to Joss's original outline of the character, definitely a lot darker. The only area where I would say this movie lets the viewer down is in the CGI department. Even the ZOIC! special effects on the TV screen outstripped some of the shots in this effort. But, that small gripe apart, the movie was as entertaining as I had hoped: funny, sad (dreadfully in places) and exciting in just about the correct measures. As a previous reviewer has stated, I hope this movie gains the bums on seats required to see some sequels.",Serenity
1517,outside_context_problem,All that could have been...,9,9 October 2005,"Summary: Probably the most enjoyable film of the summer season (OK, OK, it's fall now, but bear with me). Action packed without being gratuitous, characters with flaws and shades that aren't trowelled on, a plot that take you to unexpected places, good acting, great dialogue (Mr Lucas, can you hear me?) and a breathless finale that really makes for a worthy pay-off.It's a high rating, I know, but it's the first film I've seen this year that made me really care about what was happening. The characters were much better rounded than I'd expected, given the large lead cast not everybody was going to get enough screen-time to be fleshed out completely, but what there was was good, with the centre-stage cast doing a great job, Fillon and Glau being outstanding.However, the film isn't flawless, sometimes due to the relatively small budget (some of the cg is >slightly< plastic), sometimes due to some strange editing and camera use that feels more at home on the small screen - especially in the first half. Then there is the plot, which rattles so fast that there's no opportunity to take a bathroom break or loose attention. Sometimes it a case of blink and you miss it.The biggest weakness, however, is also the film's greatest strength. It doesn't FEEL like a Hollywood job. Characters face the consequences of their actions nd choices to be where they are, and the price is sometimes very high indeed.Finally, did anybody else spot the new Battlestar Galactica in one shot?",Serenity
1518,thesaints23,Outstanding,10,7 October 2005,"I am not a huge fan of sci-fi in fact I have a very hard time taking it serious... But this movie changes my whole perspective on it... It's got the humor in it which makes you know you're supposed to be laughing and it's got some great old school action, which I've been missing in movies. Go see this movie... you will not regret it... hell take a girl to see it... the poles show that females seem to like it just as much if not more than males do... so go see it. Why not see it... You'll be happy you did... Stop reading this and go see it already... Holy Crap you're still reading this.... If you keep reading this I'm just gonna tell you the ending... I'm just kidding you'll have to go see it to get that.",Serenity
1519,vbwarwick,Where is the nearest DVD store,8,12 October 2005,"I haven't watched Firefly (my loss if the series is nearly as good as this movie). There is an obvious comparison to Star Wars as the 'rebels with a cause' use low tech and street smarts to fight a superior adversary. This is infused with a classic western theme, the civil war hero turned outlaw by his circumstances. The question is one of freedom of the individual, and what such freedom constitutes in the face of social engineering. I was also interested at how power and sanity were depicted in relation to one another. The blend of these genres as well as various themes makes for a highly entertaining movie. What I particularly enjoyed was the fact that the director respects his audience. For example, it is taken for granted that the viewer will understand concepts like hyperspace and tracing devices but there is also the appreciation that a big gun or sword is more visually effective than a blue laser beam when it comes to killing bad guys. As I walked out of the theatre I thought: ""Where is the nearest DVD store, I need to buy a Firefly box set.""",Serenity
1520,bboyz01,Fun ride - Characters that don't take themselves too seriously but know when it's time to get crunk,10,7 October 2005,"The writers did a great job in this movie. It was complete in that you don't feel as if there's something else you needed to know or that they should've explained something else better at the end. There are possibilities, like with Star Trek, that they could if they wanted to create a series of movies with these characters. The acting was good, and the effects were great, but not over the top.Glad I spent the money would do so again if I thought it would help to either continue the story or bring the show back to TV as Firefly Season 2. The characters and the story itself is great sleeper material. It wasn't given a fair chance when on TV.Go see the movie, you'll be glad you did.",Serenity
1521,jcnightangel,Could we kill the western talk??,7,8 October 2005,"I loved the story line and the characters but did they have to talk so western?! I mean the westerns are kinda on the outs. If it were popular and the in thing, then by all means, let them lasso up and ride em cowboy but it's not! I think they could have done less of the western gab and more update phrases even if they are on or from backyard worlds. I really believe it will hurt this movie in the long run and the only thing saving it are the die hard fans which from what I gather are about the only thing that gave it this second chance. Yeah Star Trek fans saved it for years but as we are seeing they couldn't save it forever and I don't believe Serenity has the fan base to live that long. Sorry but this movie was just shy of great!",Serenity
1522,kazzahdrane,Possibly the best sci-fi film I've seen,10,10 October 2005,"First off, a confession. While I have seen the Firefly series (excellent viewing, check out the DVD set) and loved it, I've tried my best to make this review objective. You might now be looking at the 10/10 score I gave it and are thinking ""yeah sure, objective"", but please read on and be open-minded :D The movie follows the crew of the transport starship ""Serenity"" as they travel the stars trying to find work(often illegal) to make ends meet. These are no larger-than-life heroes with chiseled jaws and Starfleet uniforms, these are deep three-dimensional characters who are believable and most importantly written in such a way that makes their interactions incredibly fluid.Not long into the film the real plot begins, with the Alliance (a bit like the Federation of Star Trek but very controlling of the populace) sending an assassin after the crew, intent on killing the teenage girl they are sheltering along with her brother who acts as the ship's doctor. (this is all in the trailers and the movie blurb, no spoilers here!) The beauty of Serenity is that you could take the characters and put them in any situation and they would react in a wonderful fashion. Their traits are not determined by the script, rather the way they act always seems like it's just what they would do if they were real people. The sci-fi background is great, certainly, but the fact that Joss has chosen not to include many of the ""staples"" of science-fiction films shows how well the characters stand up themselves. There are no aliens here, no time travel and certainly no ship with pristine white corridors and captains with snobby accents(well not on the side of the good guys anyway!).As with the series the music is extremely good. I don't have much of an ear for music usually but the tracks all come in at just the right time and accompany the visuals very well.I honestly can't recommend this film enough. The other films I've seen lately like Star Wars III and even Sin City just didn't engage me as Serenity did. As an aside, I took 15 people to see the film with me and although only 3 of us had seen the Firefly series, all 16 of us enjoyed the movie a lot. Enough so that a number of them decided to buy the Firefly DVDs ASAP. Even if you just want to see a film and not bother with the series etc, Serenity works 100% as a standalone feature. The existing fans just get 110% from it! In the end, you can't stop the signal. So see Serenity.",Serenity
1523,Melune,I really enjoyed this movie,10,8 October 2005,"I really enjoyed this movie, It followed along great with the T.V. show. I did though have some disappointments. First when a main character gets killed (hopefully he can come back in flashbacks or some thing, he was one of my favorite characters) and the second was that I feel it needed to show more human contact/relationships. This will hopefully come around with the sequel. Summer Glau performance, was one of my favorites, especially the two major fight scenes. I have found that whatever Joss Whedon writes is usually good.I like how in-depth and multifaceted the plots and character become and that they continual change. Even though i am just a fan. I want to give kudos and Thanks to everyone who worked on Firefly the show and Serenity, cast and crew.",Serenity
1524,eriksangel-1,Excellent,10,8 October 2005,"I'm not part of the Firefly fan base. I had no clue going in what this movie would be about. I'm not even much of a sci-fi watcher, even though I have had the pleasure of seeing Joss Whedon's work before (in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, of course). After seeing the trailer and listening to some friends say it was amazing, I was curious enough to pay for the ticket, and after all isn't that what the market banks on? Curiosity? I came out of it ranting and raving in excitement. This was an amazing experience that I am going to want to have again and again, introduced me to an incredible world with amazing people in it, and I'm hooked. Wonderful movie. Now excuse me, I have to go find Firefly the series on DVD!",Serenity
1525,Downes,Best science fiction since the Matrix,10,8 October 2005,"Everybody knows that Serenity is the movie version of Firefly - everybody but me, that is, as Firefly was not shown where I live. And so, as the movie played, I was thinking, this would make a great TV series. yeah.What this movie does have is respect for the science fiction genre and the science fiction viewer. The details are lovingly filled in, from the idiomatic dialogue to the filling of the ship with knick-knacks to the exploration of the motives and desires of what normally be secondary characters.And it has cracking good action too, enough to satisfy people raised on Xena and Andromeda, more than enough for fans of the more sedate Star Trek. Many compare Serenity with Star Wars, but while the latter has a lot of action, Serenity has a lot of action with a point - it's not just mindless fighting, things move forward with purpose.Serenity, in other words, is as close to perfect as science fiction can get. The only thing better would be the space to develop some of the characters and themes. It would, after all, make a great TV series.",Serenity
1526,Lattitude,Pleasantly Surprised,8,8 October 2005,"I was not aware of the Firefly TV show before I decided to see this movie tonight. I had no expectations, but I was blown away. It had everything that makes a good action picture: humor, spaceship dogfights, kungfu, zombie-fu, four love stories that were not made of cardboard (Ala Star Wars), a real bad guy, a real good guy and characters that have, well - character. And the overarching story was just the right size - not biblical by any means - but roomy enough to give the characters enough space to breathe. Fantastic! And the Reavers were simply butt-clinching scary.Go see this movie. You will not regret it.",Serenity
1527,krystel_66,Great Movie,10,8 October 2005,"I loved this movie. I didn't get bored watching it, it was face paced and funny. very Entertaining. The special effects were awesome and it had a good plot line though it was based on the Firefly Series, you didn't have to see any of it and it had an original plot it was not something that is in 10 different movies a year. I would go see it again or buy it when it comes out on video. I don't know much about the cast members but I thought they all did a pretty good job with their characters. At the end I wished there was more to see. I am sorry that I never watched the Firefly series I usually like Joss Whedon but never found the time to watch it, I am regretting it now. I hope they do a sequel. If you liked the series Starhunter, you will like this movie.",Serenity
1528,rrothberg,this movie was god awful,3,9 October 2005,"I don't understand how this movie is getting such amazingly high ratings. I first heard of it in the Babylon 5 newsgroup and people were raving. If B5 fans are raving, then I figure it must be good. So I look at IMDb, after 10,000 votes it has almost a 9 rating, thats Godfather territory... and people comparing it to Star Wars. Well, all these people are insane. Every last one of them.I'm a huge sci-fi fan, the wife is a big Buffy fan, I figure this might be something for both of us. She liked it, I thought it was utter tripe. BAD BAD BAD acting, the story might make a good 4000 page series of books, but as a 120 minute movie it just didn't work (and I don't think I could have taken more than 120 minutes of that acting, I was really really close to walking out). I don't even get the point of the psychic girl, she contributed nothing except kicking some butt. Her psychic powers were only leveraged as an excuse to find Miranda. I was waiting for her to use them to read people's minds to open the safe and other cool stuff. Her brother was equally as useless in the whole plot of the movie. ICK, I highly recommend skipping this movie, it's not even worth a DVD rental.",Serenity
1529,jez_sandy,One the best action movies ever comes out of nowhere!,10,10 October 2005,"When I saw the promos and read about the TV show, I thought this was going to be some god-awful Babylon 5 type trash. I couldn't have been more wrong, and haven't enjoyed an action movie this much for years (certainly not a sci-fi movie).I won't get into making comparisons, but it gave me the kind of buzz i got from watching Indiana Jones or Star Wars. It's that much fun.Apart from about ten minutes in the middle where it lags a little bit, the pacing is absolutely perfect. The special effects are used more sparingly, and far more effectively, than the last Star Wars efforts. The characters are endearing, and the script quirky and witty.And best of all, it captures the magic moment when you realise how the hero is going to turn the tide on the enemy - like Superman crushing General Zod!",Serenity
1530,RegentOfSalaria,Fantastic Film,10,11 October 2005,"I know my voice is one in many, but I still wish it to be known that Serenity is a wonderfully done film. I was a fan of the television show, and when it was cancelled, it was horribly unfair. However, Universal has given the cast a second chance, and Joss Whedon has taken this chance to make it into a brilliant, funny, dramatic, and daring film. I was riveted from beginning to end, and was amazed at how one minute I would be feeling great sadness, and the very next laughing loudly. The entire audience was just as involved and entertained, so I truly recommend this to anyone. I have met people who hated sci-fi movies and saw Serenity and is now a big fan.",Serenity
1531,jwl540,good sci if with believable characters,10,11 October 2005,"This destined to be a classic with the other greats of the past such as ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"". It has people that you can warm up to. Characters that you care about. The special effects are not the basis of the story. In so many science fiction motion pictures is seems that the actors are just there for their reactions to them. ""Serenity"" puts the admittedly great special effects in their proper perspective and lets the interaction of the characters entertain and touch you. Even if a sequel is never made, this movie gave a final chapter to the Firefly series that made me feel like I've just finished reading a great book and want to flip back through the pages to keep the story in my heart.",Serenity
1532,eric-886,No Aha moment,7,12 October 2005,"There wasn't nearly enough sci-fi, in this film for me to consider it a true sci-fi film. The film is as sci-fi as Indiana Jones is a Airplane film. There were moments of sci-fi, but not a genre film.As someone who missed the initial release of the series, and has only caught an episode or two on the sci-fi channel replays, I just feel that something was missing. The film was very character relationship driven, as opposed to character driven. It feels like the director wanted to you know how each character related to the others, more than what each character felt individually.There were moments where internal struggle appeared within ""Mal"", but no great revelation about his character. He didn't seem to grow. Simon, the villain, seems to develop, however it is somewhat non climatic. His persona whimpers and falls into his defeat and reconciliation.This isn't a bad film, just not what I expected.",Serenity
1533,raymondjuden-rj9,An incredible achievement,10,13 October 2005,"Only seen the film once so far, but certainly intend to go again. This is one of the most enjoyable films i've seen for quite some time, and yes, this is partly down to the fact that i love firefly and adore the characters. Joss is a genius, but then if you're reading this you probably already know. I'm not going to write a full critical analysis yet because my initial response to the film is an emotional one, and there's so much to digest upon one viewing that i won't comment on direction, cinematography, music, editing etc yet, but i can safely say they're above the norm.For me, this film is a testament to the notion that firefly had the potential to surpass Buffy & Angel, the characters are so rich and diverse, and not one outing these people have yet undertaken has left me with an oddly sour aftertastelessness, as the aforementioned shows have on more than one occasion. I just hope that ticket sales by far eclipse the budget, that the profits are reasonable enough to green light many joss-led projects in the hopefully near future. But sadly, i fear this is just too good for the mainstream to appreciate, as there's so much more to this universe than flashy effects, action sequences and attractive people.That said, those seem to bring in the numbers these days, and who are we to say that something deserving actually merits reward?",Serenity
1534,captkirk285,Must See TV (and Movie),10,17 October 2005,"I cannot properly convey Whedon's genius in this film. I only recently found Firefly about 3 weeks before Serenity opened. Since then, it has become my favorite TV series of all time and Serenity has become, of course, my favorite movie.There are no wasted or cheesy moments in the film. The brilliance of Whedon is that he truly makes the characters believable and even Firefly virgins will quickly become attached them. You will laugh, cry, and worry with them through every moment of the movie. My girlfriend, a relative Firefly virgin, has seen only the first episode of the series and was choked up with the death of Book and Wash. I, myself, was even crushed and teary eyed when Wash and Book were killed and when the crew attended to their graves at the end of the movie. Unlike so many films with their extraordinary action sequences where the main characters always come off relatively unscathed, Whedon proves that the good guys are not always invulnerable. Not only are there dramatic moments, but humorous ones as well. Here is where Kaylee (Jewel Staite) takes the spotlight; Whedon and his writers have given her some of the wittiest lines of the entire movie.Whether you are a Firefly fan or not, this original and entertaining movie is one that you would be ill-advised to miss.",Serenity
1535,gordonsimpsonnz,Way over-rated...,6,12 October 2005,"I felt compelled to write a comment about this movie after flicking through some of the (very many) comments posted - none of which appeared to be below an 8! This movie simply does not deserve to be number 125 on the all time list...Let me explain. I haven't seen the Firefly series. I am a Joss Whedon ""fan"" - but not an unreserved one. I watched most of Buffy, either on TV, buying or hiring tapes and downloading divx rips etc. Some of it was great. But what I most liked was the humour, inventiveness and snappy dialogue. What I most disliked was the slide into soap-opera-ness (that seems almost inevitable with any long-running series of this kind e.g. x-files).Back to Serenity. Some of the action and plot was good, most notably in the first half hour or so. But then it had to become much more filled with ""issues"" - the rather contrived tensions between the captain (sorry I cant be bothered looking up character names) and his love interest, the doctor and the obvious Willow-based character etc. And the supposed-to-be-stirring speech by the captain about how the truth had to get out and all that nonsense. And the funeral scene. OMG, triple helpings of cheese! Cheese with ham fists! I think I must be particularly sensitive to stuff that seems like its trying too hard on the emotional front. And I really did feel like it was quite hammy, contrived and OTT in many bits. Does no-one else agree? Perhaps I should also note that I saw NightWatch directly afterwards, which I loved. So much more understated and stylish!",Serenity
1536,Nemonie,Fabulous,10,13 October 2005,"I love this film, its fabulous. Everyone should go and see it. Its exciting and funny and sad and silly and poignant. Joss Whedon has managed to write a truly breathtaking story about some pretty damn wonderful characters. The action is the best I've seen in a very long time, the bad guys are wonderfully creepy (as are some of the ""good guys""). When bad stuff happens, its very very bad. The acting is also amazing, bar none. These actor's really know their characters and fit them perfectly. They are also all rather pretty and shiny. Slightly more screen time for Book and Inara would have been nice though. This is how a movie should be made, and it proves that you don't need a hundred million dollar budget to do that, just a whole lotta love and will.",Serenity
1537,cmonster2003,Amazing Movie,10,13 October 2005,"I've seen this movie 4 times so far and can't wait to see it again. It's truly amazing! It's full of action, humor and heartbreak. Must see even if you don't like sci-fi movies. The actors are awesome and the story is fresh and original. The fights are beautifully choreographed and the special effects will blow you away! When was the last time you saw a movie set in space and it had no aliens? You don't have to be a fan of Firefly to get this movie. Although there are cool little things throughout the movie for those of us that are Firefly fans. Kudos to Joss and everyone involved in this movie for believing enough to get this movie made. I for one thought it was definitely worth the wait to see Serenity and the crew back in the sky where they belong.",Serenity
1538,damiangraham,Worst Movie of the Year??,1,24 October 2005,"Stunningly terrible!! From start to finish this movie watches like a painful bowel movement! I am a big Sci Fi fan and as such put up with a lot of bad movies but I will have to stop at this one. I can't be bothered to go further into it all as I feel like part of my life has already been stolen but just hope that this will serve as a warning to anyone thinking this may be good. I feel ashamed that the previews tricked me into actually getting excited about this show..... Remember most theaters have a ""30 minute in/ get your money back"" clause.... Use it young padawan!! I thought Starship Troopers 2 was bad but this may be worse???? You will be better of re-watching Blade Runner or the Island as opposed to this..... Anyways enough. I hate to be so negative as a lot of work went into this but yikes....",Serenity
1539,richard-w-jackson,Finally a film that lived up to expectations!,9,10 November 2005,"First off I will admit that I was a fan of the ""Firefly"" series back in 2002, and I was shocked when Fox decided to cancel the show (something which they have been doing a lot in the pass few years), but anyway I had been looking forward to this movie since I found out that it was being made. And I have to say from a fan's perspective this film more that lived up to my expectations. I am a huge sci-fi fan, and when I compare this film to other sci-fi movies I have to say this film tops all of them (except for maybe the original Star Wars trilogy). I loved the series because it had a great cast of realistic characters, and it went the other way of most sci-fi stories, as most of the future was not glamorous and high-tech. So I loved that the old characters were back, and the new characters especially The Operative are great and believable. I also like how this movie was not like another episode of the show with a bigger budget, the story here actually seems like it has changed physically and emotionally changed the characters. However the reason I rated this film with a 9 as opposed to a 10 is because although I think the movie does a pretty good job of making the film accessible to people who never saw the show (my little brother never saw a single episode of the show, but still loved the movie) I think you have to at least have some clue of the show to get the full enjoyment out of it. But as a fan I loved it and I hope they make a sequel.",Serenity

There's plenty of laughs and a good story. The film is worth seeing but's it's not a 10 movie by any means - I think those die hard Firefly fans have been frantically voting in their droves.",Serenity
1541,mrknobs,One of the best SF movies in recent history,10,14 October 2005,"I'd never seen the series ""Firefly,"" but that didn't interfere in my enjoyment one bit.This is a quirky sci-fi ""western"" that nonetheless addresses the big questions of life and humanity. It contains some surprisingly funny lines and even a little raunchy sexual humor from time to time. The actor who plays ""Mal"" the captain is perfect for the role, as is the superb actor who plays the villain.This movie works on several levels; if you're the sort who enjoys the mindless shoot-em-up of the comic-like Star Wars series there's plenty for you to enjoy here. But that is the least this movie has to offer. It's the classic battle of good vs. evil, of friends fighting and dying for each other against impossible odds, and still finding a few moments to laugh while doing it.If you decide to see this, I suspect you'll join the line of folks buying the boxed set of the Firefly series.Give it a watch, you won't be sorry.Terry D.",Serenity
1542,Cambellstu,Eye candy!,8,18 October 2005,"This was an awesome movie. The target audience was primarily for males since it had a lot of action sequences, gun fights, spaceship battles and explosions. It had an almost modern day Star Wars feel to it. The acting was compelling and the story captivating. It wasn't your typical good guy bad guy plot. It took a while to figure out who was really the villain and the hero in Serenity. It could easily be seen why this movie received a PG-13 rating and I was somewhat surprised why it wasn't rated R (probably since there was no foul language). Some of the scenes were overly gory and bloody, especially the scene when the antagonist made his partner fall on his own sword. The computer enhance graphics were stunning, crisp and realistic. Especially in the climatic space dog fight between the Alliance warships and these humanoid, ugly creatures. The opening sequence draws the viewer into the story and is enhanced with hologram computer effects. The movie is about a vigilante group of space pirates who operate on a spacecraft named Serenity. Perhaps the name implies a state of peace, or calm, something that everyone on board is looking for in a home planet. There is a special cargo on board. A human with psychic powers and trained as a weapon in martial arts. The Alliance which is the the form of government that is ever reaching and all powerful in the galaxy is responsible for creating her. She is stolen from the Alliance and government officials want her back. And thus the story unfolds, and the decision to keep her on board rest in the hands of the captain.",Serenity
1543,melv_a80,Joss Whedon is a great writer,10,14 October 2005,The thing that is missing nowadays in movies is closure. Everyone writes stories that leave many side story lines open and without closure. Joss Whedon is consistent in his writing and has improved as he moves from project to project. Serenity is his best example of an excellent story that leaves no ends untied. The potential for this TV series made into a movie has not only been met but has far exceeded itself. If there is a sequel bring it on but I am totally happy with the movie as it is and look forward to Whedon's future works. The acting was magnificent and the casting choice calculated and careful. I wish each one a great acting career and hope to see them soon in other great works. This movie is definitely a must see again and again.,Serenity
1544,pillpopper,a fresh approach at Sci-Fi,9,15 October 2005,"I wanted to see this movie due to its high ratings on IMDb. I must say that I wasn't disappointed. I never watched the show Firefly, nor had I even heard of it until the movie serenity came out; yet, I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone wanting not only an entertaining movie, but a neat approach to sci-fi.The movie has random bits of humor -- which I thought were kind of stupid at first. However, as the movie went on and I thought about it a bit more, the humor and the subtle dialog in certain areas really bring depth to the characters. An example of the fresh approach I speak of is that the captain of the ship is not your typical cool, calm, reserved, always-in-control type of commander. Rather, he is shown to be a person; much like the rest of us, who has his faults, and isn't always sure of himself. Another bit is that while it is a science fiction flick, it isn't too heavy on the science; rather, it seems to use the science aspect as merely a setting, with a great story that takes place within that virtual world.If you like science fiction, or even if you don't, I'd recommend seeing it!",Serenity

I thought it  would be an epic movie - Star Wars alike - but I was completely  deceived! The movie is very bad! River's character is completely  ridiculous, and the many joke attempts along the film - for example ""i  swallowed a bug"" after a big fight scene - are very bad. I was hoping a  lot better from this movie; therefore, and because of it's hugely  overrated 8.5 value, i voted 1. It's not a honest vote and does not  shows my true opinion of the film, but serves the purpose to lower it  into a more real rate.",Serenity
1546,mcgranger,"A fantastic movie that can anyone can get into, one of the best films in recent times.",10,15 October 2005,"Being a fan of Angel and enjoying one of the best T.V shows in the past couple of years, I never got into 'Firefly' when it aired on T.V. It was a show that was advertised as 'A new show from the guy behind Buffy', but I didn't get into it for a few reasons, but it had always been there in the back of my mind as the show I thought 'Hmm, maybe I should check out why these reviewers are giving it great scores'.So, with the release of 'Serenity' in cinemas, my sister and I, big fans of Angel, thought it was time to find out what this movie(and the Firefly universe) was about.After stepping out of the film, staying right until the end of the credits, my first thought was 'Why the !frack! didn't I get into this earlier?!' Serenity is brilliant on so many levels and for so many reasons. Sitting in the cinema, from the jolting first scenes(it actually made me jump at some of the suddenness of the actions on screen) to the great characters, and the cast that really felt like they 'belonged' in this world, I was amazed.All the main characters and cast from the (sadly) axed TV show 'Firefly' are in it(plus a few new ones too), and they use they're previous work and experience in that universe to deliver performances that had me laughing then cheering then almost drawing a tear and then on the edge of my seat.Whedon is known for having a strong cast in his works, and to date the Firefly/Serenity gang are right up there with many of my fav characters in all mediums, whether book or film.The special effects are suitably beefed up for the film(the advantage of a bigger budget) and my personal favourite 'shaky-cam snap-zoom' camera work is in it too. It really adds to the film, doing away with the static and perfectly still camera work that sometimes isn't as exciting as the documentary style technique is.It adds in particular to the big space battle near the end, with the camera always focusing on Serenity, making it's way through the chaos, but zooming in and out to show you that you can still get those grand epic shots and also stay focused on what you need to be focused on. And the fact that the battle doesn't overshadow the main part of the story(the ship and her crew) while managing to fulfill my lust for explosions and lasers is fantastic.If there was one fault, it would be that the assassin/shady government character starts off a bit too...strange and unbelievable, but after the initial confusion of what the character is like and what he will do, you soon know where he stands and the caliber of the man he is.Apart from that, the other new character is great, and fits in perfectly without any detail troubles that'll have you thinking' that doesn't make sense'.So, in conclusion, this movie rocks. Seriously. I've heard that it isn't doing to well ticket and sale wise, so I urge anyone who reads this review to see this film immediately, and get your friends to come too, it is one of the best films in recent times, and won't fail to satisfy.Don't miss out.",Serenity
1547,DanskTime,The Great Movie Serenity,10,19 November 2005,"What can I say about this movie other then its great? It has replaced my previous all time favorite movie. The characters are very human and draw you into the story. The plot line is based on a well written story and not held together with explosions and/or gore. The comedy is well timed to be amusing and to relive tension without taking away from the validity of the scene. There is everything you could want from a truly great story: valor, duty, honor, love, companionship, a real villain, the characters learn and grow, and appropriate action and drama. This movie has the ability to draw you in so that you take the ride with the characters rather than watching from the sidelines. This is one of those truly great stories that you can simply watch or you can explore it in-depth and still find new things to love no matter how many times you watch it. I love this movie and the show Firefly that it is based on. And so you know you don't have to see the show to love this movie.",Serenity

It was so unpredictable and so fun to watch and every moment had me at the edge of my seat! I kept hoping it would go on and on! I loved the colloquial farm-boy speak. I love the script in general - so many funny lines in so many funny places. And River is Bad@$$! I can't believe she hasn't been a martial artist her whole life instead of a ballerina! With a gorgeous cast (see Inara), a great story, tons of action, many questions left unanswered but leaving us intrigued and thinking about it for days, I predict a sleeper hit.

The movie really made you want to take more adventures with this crew. I grew up as a huge fan of Star Wars. Serenity is the next best thing, maybe better because you feel that these worlds could exist today, right outside your door. It's a Western in Space with humor and heart.

You get right to the movie, and for Firefly fans, we didn't have to wait through a grueling few minutes of wasted time to get through the credits, and finally to the movie. What we all paid to see. Buy some popcorn, wait a few minutes before trying to eat it, and settle in for a great time.You are not going to walk out of the movie thinking you've wasted 15 bucks. Your going to want to come back and see it again, and again. I've heard complaints that the movie didn't even ""top the box office"". Don't go by box office results to see if a movie is good.

1552,chillingdave,Tips to enjoy this film,8,20 October 2005,"1. Ignore the poster (UK version). It's staggeringly unrepresentative.2.Don't watch if you're feeling tired. You won't enjoy it and may fall asleep (which my friend, who loves this genre, did). 3. Don't expect high-brow or low-brow - it's somewhere in the middle, knotted-brow possibly. 4. Concentrate on the plot, especially at the beginning. This isn't Starship Troopers. It's at the level of a more thoughtful Star Trek episode. 5. Be patient for the special effects. You'll get your reward in good time.Do all these things and you will thoroughly enjoy it.",Serenity
1553,musicnow703,one of this years best movies,10,17 October 2005,"Joss Whedon stepped up to the plate and hit a home run. This movie was truly meant for the big screen. If you've never seen the television show 'Firefly', no worries, all is explained in the movie. At first I thought negatively about them changing the title, but seeing is believing and it worked. Everything from the brilliant choice of actors to the sets to the dialog and of course a storyline was perfect. This very well might be the next Indiana Jones/Star Wars for this generation. Joss Whendon please continue to make wonderful movies and wonderful television for our sense of fantasy can be swept away and connect with a world out of this world and beyond.",Serenity
1554,marrowood-71467,A real sci-fi movie - couldn't look away,10,5 May 2017,"At first I was put off by the trailer - to watch it is to believe that ""Serenity"" is full of martial arts and punches to the face. That's actually just a part of this. This is a smart, funny and campy sci-fi space opera that can touch your heart. Loved it all except Mal's enunciation - had to rewind over and over again because he mumbles so badly. It's probably a low-budget thing, and I get it that the ""outlander"" rebel speak some 19th-century dialect. But the dude just plain mumbles his lines. Otherwise, a stellar film! Sci-fi classic.",Serenity
1555,joesmimi,Great movie,9,20 October 2005,"This movie has a little of everything. Great special effects, the storyline is good and the actors are good. The dialog is amazing and Joss Whedon's quick wit is apparent throughout. I loved Ron Glass when he was in Barney Miller and it is great to see him back on the screen. Most of the other actors aren't as well known but I am sure will be seen more of now that this movie has come out. Especially the guy who plays Malcolm Reynolds. He is a really great looking guy who can deliver a line. The actor who played the villain was good too and really personified evil. Like Star Wars, this movie was basically about the good guys going up against the big bad guys but it holds it own because of the dialog and the chemistry between the cast members. Seeing this movie has made me want to get the Firefly episodes on DVD so I can see more of this great ensemble.",Serenity
1556,tharen_bria,Faithful to a good series canceled too early,9,19 October 2005,"Serenity is based off the TV show Firefly, which ran for only 11 episodes. The show is very humorous and the movie is as well. The characters work as a terrific unit but are distinct individuals in both the show and the movie. While this began as a TV show, you do not have to have any background with it to see and enjoy the film. This was tested by a mixed group of us, not all of whom had seen the film and not all of whom loved sci-fi adventure. The camera work, effects and directing are not blockbuster ultra-new tech, but done very well for the sci-fi element. If you like sci-fi or action/adventure, it's well worth viewing. Fun and wit rather than dead pan serious or campy comedy.",Serenity
1557,foxm_99,Please come back to TV!!!!,10,19 October 2005,"I went and was excited to say the least - one of my favorite shows turned into a major motion picture! YIKES! Reminded me of the X-files movie premiere.I left the theatre totally blown away! Much better than I had even dreamed. Great story, great acting, and, of course, great direction. (As always, Joss!) The characters are strong, the story is fluid and embracing, and the movie leaves you saying, but what about... , what happens to... , where does... PLEASES TELL ME, I CAN""T WAIT FOR THE NEXT MOVIE! I'd like to bankroll the $50 million to make the movie myself just to know more of this INCREDIBLE story.GREAT, GREAT MOVIE! I've seen it four times, and as long as my wife doesn't mind, tonight looks like a great night for number5! HIGHLY Recommended! I wish it would come back to TV (hint, hint sci-fi channel, WB, UPN) just so we wouldn't have to wait for more! The Browncoats will rise again!",Serenity
1558,barbraque_13,A Must See!,10,20 October 2005,"This movie is awesome! It is very intense from start to finish. I love how it follows from the ""Firefly"" television show very well, which should never have been canceled. So many movies have contradictions when they come from a television show. I recommend that you see the television show first, but it's not entirely necessary. The television show provides background information and humor that may be missed if you have not seen the show. The movie explains many things that the television show did not have time to address. I can't wait for future movies to dig deeper into the plot lines that were left undiscovered even in the movie. Unfortunately the network canceled the television show before it even had a chance to be successful. The writing is great. The depth of the characters is wonderful. The cast couldn't be better suited to the roles. Who knows, it could be the next cult classic. A must see! Go support this movie in the theaters so that they will see its draw and make more!",Serenity
1559,wewait,Must See More,10,15 March 2006,"I didn't ever watch the TV series and went to the movie only based on the appeal of the trailer.I LOVED this movie and have already watched it numerous times on DVD.Wow, I was enthralled by the characters and the writing. I really, really, really want to see more of them... what happens to them next? I just ordered the complete TV series on DVD.Why does really good work such as this not get the attention it deserves.

1560,Peggy_Petrowicz,This is Josh's Best work EVER !,10,20 October 2005,"I have been watching Action and Sci-Fi movies since Star Wars/Star Trek/Alien days. This movie is by far the BEST overall action, drama, comedy, sci-fi movie I have ever seen. FINALLY something NEW and original. Say what you will this is not spin off nor take off on anything. This was rich and powerful. Josh takes us into his world immediately. And the actors were SUPERB! Each one was amazing to watch. I was (and still am) a BIG fan of the FireFly series that was on, ... which I am really would like to see come back. This movie takes fans and non-Firefly fans into its grasp within seconds. You are embraced in a future that frankly ... could happen... Forget aliens... this is about US about Humans. This is something that Western Movies fans (the non-sci-fi'ers would enjoy as well as Sci-fi Fans). The way Josh had it filmed. The Ship itself became one of the characters, you just fell in love with each character and the ship itself. The costumes, the way the actors looked, and talked was well scripted. I laughed, I cried, I saw it several times and each time I saw something new or heard a conversation in the forefront or even some in the background that was hilarious that I had not seen or heard before. I WILL BE buying this when it comes out on DVD! WOW, well done Josh, the Crew and ALL the actors! Well done! Bravo!",Serenity

Serenity Rocks!! It allows us to kick back and enjoy the ride. The follow through with the identification of ""Mal"", ""Zoe"", ""Wash"", ""Inara"", ""Jayne"",""Kaylee"",""Simon"" and the amazing ""River"" will leave you wanting more too. The original concept is broaden by this film, the characterizations are spot on. I found it refreshing to see a movie that allows for the suspension of reality, while making the unbelievable seem to be believable. The series ""Firefly"" lured us in and this movie just keeps us coming back for more. Sorry, no spoiler here, I loathed those who ruin things for others. Trust me run over, see this film, and you too can join those of us who simply want more .... Just give us more ""Serenity""!",Serenity
1562,BroomPilot90,"Adventure, great storytelling, exciting visual technique combine",10,21 October 2005,"One of those rare films that flirts with a genre or two (science fiction, action/adventure) but is a cinematically well-told story about people living in a particular reality. From a story perspective, it reminds me of the best of the classic westerns -- True Grit, Man Who Shot Liberty Valance -- though in a context of human society & even technology that feels much more contemporary and in that sense ""real"" than a period piece or space opera. Even the ""heroes"" of Serenity are, like those of the great old westerns, remarkable humans but not really superior or ""saintly"" ones.Admittedly, I went in as a Firefly aficionado, but one does not need the rich detail of that backstop to find the universe of Serenity fully developed -- only to (a) want t-shirts with the ship's name/logo on them and (b, seriously) experience the extra thrill of seeing the ship and other technological elements of the world built, animated, and post-produced to be what it should always have been save for the limitation of TV budgets. Anyone who enjoys the emotional catharsis of a good story well told can appreciate this film, and I think will highly enjoy it.",Serenity
1563,ralfe-1,What a ride!,10,22 October 2005,"Great movie! It was very intense in places, funny, action packed, sad. I was actually sitting on the edge of my seat in the theater. We definitely need more sequels. I have always liked the Star Trek movies but Firefly and Serenity are not ""sanitized"" down and politically correct. We are talking wild, rugged, violent outer space. What has always impressed me when I watched the Firefly series is what a divergent cast of characters the ship has. What a mismatched set of people that seem to work well together. I will think about this movie for days and will not be able to wait for the DVD to come out. Maybe my husband and I will see it again at ""the cheap seats"" when it finishes the first run theaters.",Serenity
1564,feelingschimera,Easiest way to forget a high-budget nonsense.,10,14 November 2005,"Well, hello there everybody! Forgive my poor English, but it wouldn't be as good if I didn't write this to support the Browncoats. So, here's goes the point: I give the TV-series a very special second (after Scarface) place in my top-10 films, and the film itself going on 5th one (couldn't pass masterpieces like Casino, Goodfellas - I'm still a crime movies fan,- come on!). It's also so good to see that something called money affected this film only in a proper way, because you can count such directors on fingers of one hand who don't waste cash and create their own world from dust. That really deserves considerable amounts of respect.Good luck to you all then, let's hope Firefly will arise like a phoenix!Peace,Kaimera.",Serenity
1565,SteelSD,Exceptional Stand-Alone Transition for Whedon,10,3 January 2006,"Very seldom do I see a television series transition as well to movie format as Serenity. Never have I seen a TV series transition to film without ever seeing the TV series (Firefly). This film made me immediately go out and buy the Firefly collection so that I know what I've been missing.However, this is truly a stand-alone movie. One does not need to have clue one as to the Firefly history to fully enjoy this flick. Whedon's writing and directing is key and each actor makes the most of his stage (particularly feature-film vet Adam Baldwin). The cinematography is excellent under Whedon's direction. The dialogue is excellent as is the chemistry between the actors.My main question with sci-fi flicks (even though I'm a big sci-fi fan) is, ""Can you reasonably suspend disbelief?"" And yes. You can. The special effects are seamlessly integrated into the film and you never end up with the sense that you're watching a ""TV"" movie on the big screen. That's a huge deal for me as I've certainly had that feeling when watching more than one Star Trek big screen films.Overall, I'd give ""Serenity"" a HUGE thumbs up even without knowing that the Firefly TV series ever existed. But now that I know, you can bet that I'll see every episode. Well done!",Serenity
1566,dukeofearl1943,A great ride!,9,26 October 2005,"I am a newbie to this particular Sci-fi adventure, even though I regularly watch a lot of what is on the The Sci-Fi Channel. I caught the preview for this movie back in June 2005 and decided then I wanted to see what all the fuss was about so I set my TIVO for the Firefly series and was pleasantly surprised by what I saw. I just returned from seeing the big screen version and was definitely impressed!! I enjoyed the ride! I expected to be the only one in the theater @ 1:00 PM on a Wednesday, a full 31/2 weeks after it initially opened and the place was 3/4 full. Yes it was a smaller showing venue yet there were 75 to 100 people in the audience. Word must be getting around. Here's my vote for restarting the TV series and/or the next exciting movie. In fact I think I am going to see it again before it moves off the big screen and will definitely be buying the DVD!!",Serenity
1567,john-jack,One of the few movies I've seen more than once in theaters...,9,27 October 2005,"I must admit that I didn't get the Firefly phenomenon when it was occurring before my eyes on various web forums, I had seen the show once or twice, and I think the only one I truly enjoyed was ""Shindig"" because I managed to catch the whole show (rather than a few minutes into it). I suppose it didn't help that I hadn't seen the intended pilot, nor ""Train Heist"" (not sure if that's the real title of the episode) for that matter. I ended up seeing Serenity soon after I tried to watch a Firefly marathon on Canada's SciFi/Fantasy cable channel, Space. I got called into work, and didn't see much of more than the pilot -- and since I got rid of my VCR and lack digital recording capability, I didn't see any other ones.So, I did end up seeing Serenity on opening night. This was enjoyable. My first reaction was positive: I enjoyed the layered opening sequence, which set things up quite well -- though it did leave a TVesque feeling to it. As is usual with the Whedon productions that I've seen, the characterization was quite good, though quirky if you're not prepared for it. I was prepared, so it went well for me.As I've said before, I've seen this movie multiple times: three times, to be exact. Once on opening night, once on a cheap night with a different friend, and then again last night with another. It seemed as though each enjoyed it, and if my little brother asks me about it, I may take him to see it as well... Part of my willingness to see it this many times is that it's new and original, but also something that I believe is something that the popular entertainment industry needs. Though I understand the use of sequels and remakes, I'd like to see more original productions based on concepts that aren't necessarily taken or rehashed from another, probably successful, piece of work.For most industries in North America, economics is what the decision-makers use to choose this genre over that, or this type of story over another. In order to show my support, I saw the movie multiple times and brought people who had not seen it before -- I may have even paid for one person, but I can't remember.In the end, I enjoyed this movie, and it's right up on my favourites list of movies. I'm not sure that it's for everyone, but for those open to the SciFi genre, this should be a no-brainer.If you're even vaguely interested in Serenity, I would recommend that you see it in theaters.",Serenity
1568,peacekeprmom,"""Cowboys and space stations""?",10,3 November 2005,"Serenity is a great film for everyone. Each of the nine main characters have a personality and style that is unique to that character. This is what makes the movie so intriguing and what keeps it from being just your average sci-fi flick. Each character keeps you continuously finding similarities between you and them, which keeps you interested in each of them for different reasons that only belong to you. The nine different personalities were perfectly intertwined and tweaked so that they all work together positively and/or negatively but with a gracious and respectful flow towards each other. The captain of serenity attempts to be a ruthless uncaring thief, scavenging the universe to make a living, only it becomes quickly obvious that he is an over protective leader watching over his odd assortment of an accidentally acquired crew.The crew also watches out for each other and proves that true faith and human spirit still exist even out in the black. Between the action and balance of good verse evil this movie ranks up there with star wars, highlander, stargate and the chronicles of riddick. with a touch of the ""waltons"" by way of unity and a time when honor and courage still meant something.",Serenity
1569,fgerlits,Awful,5,6 November 2005,"This movie is bad. The story line was combed together from several mindless Hollywood action movies; it is predictable; it is full of plot holes; and the twist, or solution, or whatever that thing was supposed to be near the end, is mind-bogglingly lame.The movie has very little of the wild west atmosphere of the series, and barely any Mandarin.It has an idiotic moral. Some moral may be unavoidable, but does it have to be the worst anti-rationalist cliché? Non-geeks may not find this as unforgivable as I did, but: when things blow up in outer space, they do not make a sound. No air, no sound. How hard is that? Joss knew this when he made the series -- how did he forget it when he made the movie?On the other hand, the characters from the series are all there, they are still great, even if they got flattened a bit. The acting is okay, and some of the dialog is funny (though most episodes had more good lines than the whole movie).Do not watch this film. Rent the series on DVD instead.",Serenity

This is the best movie I've ever seen. I must have cried for 20 minutes straight starting in an ACTION scene! First time I've ever done that. The sheer adrenaline surging through me made me slow down intentionally to catch my breath. Beautiful, funny, exiting, a must-see.WARNING: After seeing this movie you may be compelled to spend lots of money on the DVDs and other serenity loot.",Serenity
1571,hadespuppy,"Whee, more space cowboys!",9,7 November 2005,"I loved this movie. It had the feel of a really long episode of the show, and fit almost seamlessly with the continuity of the series (with a bit of exposition to acquaint new fans with everyone). It is unfortunate that we never got to see where Joss Wheden would have gone with the characters and their many secrets, such as why Inara chose to live on Firefly in the first place, and what exactly Book is hiding, but sadly the evil corporation that is Fox decided on overall ratings over the dedication of a relatively small fantasy (one that grew even after the too-soon demise of the series) So Serenity fills some of this gap, and fans of the show, as well as new fans (who will hopefully run out to rent/buy the series DVD) will be pleased with the result.",Serenity
1572,veridiansunrise,"A dark-horse. A really, really good dark-horse.",10,7 November 2005,"Serenity has all the elements of a good action film. That having been said, the things that make Serenity memorable are the nuances that makes the film's universe so unique.For example, the language people use is evolved, with Chinese in much more common use, along with an original colloquial dictionary that mixes with the standard high-tech chatter we're used to in sci-fi.I was unhappy with joss whedon's directing, however. Many scenes that could have been spectacular came out simply mediocre (especially non-space combat scenes), the best directing was with River and her sequences.AND IT WAS SCARY TOO.Please watch serenity, good film deserves recognition.",Serenity
1573,zeonlyrealgogo,Déjà vu,1,8 November 2005,"My feelings regarding this movie are definite : this movie is hugely overrated, and doesn't deserve to be seen. I went to see this movie because of the trailer : it promised to be full of fights, space opera scenes, etc. I prepared myself to see a weird mix of Matrix and Star Wars, yet, forget the fights, you get to see all the fights of the movie in the trailer, and the space opera side is quite boring.That is not the reason I disliked the movie so much. To tell the truth I prefer quieter movies, so I was rather happy to see there was not much martial arts. The movie brings nothing new. The weird twisted heroin feels like a brainwashed version of the heroin of Underworld, the captain of the ship is a failed Han Solo, the movie being a stupid metaphor for the freedom of speech... Yet there is a willingness to do original things, but these are poor attempts : the pilot of the ship, reciting some kind of poetry when in danger ends up with only one mantra he keeps repeating in an poor way, the bad guy using a sword, following some kind of Bushido, yet just another bad guy in the end... The movie was quite fun in its spite, in fact... Example : the good guy, the failed Han Solo, finds all his friends dead because of the Federation, he speaks with the other to tell them this is uncool, you see a bad guy getting out of a destroyed ship, seeming to be in a bad shape, back to the good guy who keeps speaking, then ends his speech, and as if to point the end and his resolve, turns and shoots the poor guy who barely survives. He was a bad guy, sure. That's the kind of movie it is.",Serenity

I had hoped that the response would be good enough to green light another movie or (be still my beating heart) a return to the series. Sadly, it doesn't appear this will happen.If you haven't seen it, do it. This movie has the combination of snappy inventive dialog, creative plot, and insanely talented acting that we expect from Joss. I have two daughters, 12 and 15, who also loved it, though it might be too violent for younger kids. It also provided a springboard to discussions about freedom, government, and the meaning of a 'family'.",Serenity

1577,kxl3,"Please Bring ""Firefly"" Back with New Episodes",10,12 November 2005,"After seeing ""Serenity"" at the theater, I accidentally found ""Firefly"" at Hastings and was surprised to find that there had been a TV series in 2002. My husband and I are sci-fi enthusiasts and neither of us had heard of ""Firefly"". After watching the rented DVDs, we had to purchase our own set and have not failed to watch at least two episodes every night since. Most of the current TV series don't even come close to the writing and interaction between characters. We particularly enjoy seeing non-verbal communication between characters. The finesse with which each character can basically stand alone without being drawfed by another is a talent. This brings to mind King Arthur and the round table. Each character makes the circle without anyone being at the head of the table.If anyone out there feels a need to bring back Joss Whedon and the crew of Serenity for additional series or sequels, please don't hesitate. You'll have thousands of supporters behind you. This is the best science-fiction series I have ever seen. Well done Joss, Nathan, Gina, Alan, Morena, Adam, Jewel, Sean, Summer, Ron and all the people involved in making a wonderful series and movie. You are all fantastic.",Serenity
1578,jsias,ehhh,3,26 May 2006,"This movie sucked ancient donkey dizzle. The invented dialog patterns were original but pretty lame. They kept reminding me of Tom Bombadil or something. ""I ain't had nothing twixt my nethers"" ... kept expecting to hear, ""Away go you, who are a-creepin'"". And the sets and special effects were more suited to a network TV show or a Sci-Fi channel movie. Many of the ideas felt hackneyed and cobbled together from other films. I won't say there weren't some decent moments. The flashes of truth about the world Miranda were creepy enough, and the girl kicking everyone's butts with the fluidly circular moves was aesthetically pleasing. But I found the captain to be a Han Solo wannabe with no real charm, many of the other crew-members badly in need or fleshing out (and better acting), and the plot mechanics heavy-handed. This is just my opinion; I am not trying to start a war with anyone who liked the movie. I like intelligent SF, but this just wasn't my cup of tea. It was better than the Star Wars prequels by a slim margin, though. The black guy (sorry, I forget his name) was good. He made the most of his screen time.P.S. Best line: ""God's balls, I ain't going' out there!"" Lol.",Serenity
1579,zashin,Not as Good as the TV Show,6,17 November 2005,"I found the TV show late, when SciFi Channel aired the reruns in preparation for the release of this movie. I was charmed, rented the DVD, and watched all the episodes. And I was eagerly awaiting the movie. So, unhappily, I must write that I found the movie a disappointment. For me, it downplayed or omitted many of the elements that made the TV show so special. Much less was made of the hilarious, anachronistic, wildly imaginative juxtaposition of the Old West with Outer Space. . .images like Serenity chasing a train(!), or even a buckboard, weren't there any more. Also much less of the equally creative ""culture melding"" of the TV show. . .largely reduced to having the characters swear in Chinese. I missed the crazy costumes and set dressing. . .The movie operated much more in the hi-tech world. There was a goofy quality to the TV show that the movie lacked, and that quality was what made the show special for me. There was much less emphasis in the movie on the relationships, and much too much emphasis on the fighting. There was much less humor. I can't remember any of those great sitting-around-the-dinner-table scenes in the movie, and those were such fun in the TV show. Even the color toning of the movie differed from the TV show. The show seemed filmed in a kind of warm golden tone, the movie in a much colder blue-gray tone. The movie was just much colder all around. And the theme song was gone. So, for me, the movie took a whimsical, off-beat show--that could still be very exciting and tense--and turned it into just another rather ordinary space action movie.",Serenity
1580,dabigo80,Just right,9,20 December 2005,"Great characters and good story, Serenity offers a sci-fi world that feels more ""real"" than most other movies of this genre. This movie has a good balance of action and drama. I only give this a 9 because I feel that fans of the TV series ""Firefly"" will get more out of this movie than the folks who are watching it without any knowledge of the TV show it's based on. It's still fun nonetheless.When I say the movie feels more ""real"" I am talking in terms of characterizations of the people, the political and social structure the movie shows. It makes the feel of it closer to our world, past or present. The sci-fi technology also isn't too overblown, most of it feels plausible for the future. The special effects are adequately done as well, the movie is not over-saturated with them. For fans of the TV show and genre fans, it's just right.",Serenity
1581,lakerslubin,It's a boring Movie which is not worth watching,4,4 December 2005,"Fitst of all, the movie is too long for such a simple story. The producers have spend too much time showing their high tech in making CG, though their tech and design is not as well as that was used in Star Wars. Secondly,though the director wants to tell us something, he didn't tell us anything clearly at last. He just ceaselessly using such words like believer or anything like that. At the end of the movie, he even could not tell what a men should believe in. Or maybe we should believe in god. It's really a tiring movie. P.S. I hate the Chinese words in the movie. Please don't do that again! What I wanna say at last is that the actress is not the style that I'm interested in. So it is not as attractive as movies like Star Wars.",Serenity

I was blown away: it captured my attention from the beginning. The characters seem alive and real, with all their imperfections. The actions shown embed themselves in a believable main story line of which this movie is just one adventure of hopefully many more to come.The only thing which made me sad while viewing the film is the realization that something as nightmarishly bad as 'chicken little' lures many more people to the theaters than did this SF masterpiece.The story tells itself and doesn't really care about what the audience expects of it. It works. Go see it, if you still can.",Serenity

It has everything a good movie should have and more. There's a little something for everyone. If you like non-stop action, some romance, humor, a whole lot of drama you will undoubtedly take right to heart, and/or a very unique storyline written & directed by the world-renowned Joss Whedon himself, Serenity is your Holy Grail. It's sure mine. This is a movie you will not regret buying to grace your video shelf and it's definitely one of those that gets better every time you watch it. Hands down, there needs to be a sequel. This storyline is just too good to leave as is. There needs to be more! (I also highly recommend Firefly. Things make more sense if you watch the fourteen episodes of that before attempting Serenity, but since it's so good, taking the movie straight-up works too :)",Serenity
1584,sgtcej,An absolutely great film,9,28 November 2005,"..except for the death of Wash. That really made no sense to me, and the way he went out was disappointing. From opening to ending though I was completely riveted by this film. I think what Joss may have been trying to go for is scaring us all into actually believing that anyone could die next. I mean I can understand Book being killed, (again while I wish he wasn't sometimes the small characters have to go I guess) that gave Mal a reason to be upset. Oh and Mr. Universe, who gives a crap that he died. Why was he so honorably buried next to Wash and Book. I kind of thought this was an insult to their characters. I did like the story line of the Reavers though. They finally made sense to me and I think it went together quite nicely with the battle against the Alliance.",Serenity
1585,dkellingtn,I loved this movie.,10,29 November 2005,"I would like to see a sequel to this movie. Bringing Firefly back to TV would also be great. I think Serenity is more fun than Star Trek and Star Wars put together. The character development is superb. I like Inara the best. I think she is so beautiful. Mal is a great character. I was sorry to see Wash and Book leave the story. New characters will likely also be interesting. Joss Whedon is an excellent writer and story teller. The western style overlay on this futuristic tale is charming to the max. I wait for Jane to develop a greater sense of loyalty to the captain and the ship after he nearly lost his life by his betrayal. Somewhere deep in Jane is a good person as demonstrated by his appeal to Mal not to tell the crew about his betrayal. I love the warrior lady Wash's wife, whose name escapes me for the moment. I also love the development of Summer Glau's character, River, her skills, will come in handy in future editions.",Serenity

Honestly, it's been ages since I've felt this impassioned about something... wash! no.... I was a relative latecomer to firefly, twas the film that peaked my interest. There's not enough good sci fi out there. It seems to fall into the overblown rubbish category or specialist demi art-house. It's nice to see a bit of rollicking fun every now and again. Amusing, exciting and genuinely tense in moments, why cant more films enjoy themselves as much as this one? I'll be buying multiple copies for the shop, myself, friends and family. I'm not usually this enthusiastic about something. watch this film!",Serenity
1587,paalrh,Quick Plot reference with possible spoilers,10,2 December 2005,Background: Humanity has spread out into space colonizing several planets and Terraforming them. During this period an idealistic coalition formed among the core planets. A civil war broke out between the core and outer worlds. The core worlds won this war.Plot: A young telepathy girl is being used in a post war coalition experiment. Several key officials come to inspect the subjects and she learns a secret by passively reading their minds. The secret is about a planet. This particular planet was an experiment the coalition did before the war to try and reduce hostility among the populous. The result was that most of the population became so overcome by apathy of life that they died. Others became very violent. This is not known to the general public. The girl is set free by her brother and the story of the film goes around how the brother and sister try to escape falling into the clutches of the coalition assassin sent to apprehend them and how trough this journey they unveil the mystery behind the girls haunting dreams.,Serenity

SHE IS AWESOME! Of course Kaylee's just as cute and Inara's still doing her companion thing. The way they did the lighting and music was good too, and the graphics were wonderful. Kudos to Joss Wheden for continuing the wonderful job that he's always done (also a fan of Buffy). I hope and pray...and hope and pray..... etc, etc that Sci-Fi channel will pick it up - seeing that they played the original series counting up to the release. But, then again with two key members gone (i wanna know why by the way) I don't know if that will happen after all. Oh well.... Something should come back, they left the end wide open... going off into the stars.HORRAY FOR KAYLEE!!!",Serenity
1589,a-cuming,amazing movie,10,2 December 2005,"serenity and the show it was based off of, firefly, are some of the best science fiction made by anything ever. Star Wars is not incredibly better than it and i have loved the original star wars for years. Firefly as a show should be continued and maybe done straight to DVD, i know tons of people who would pay for a DVD of it every month of like 3 new episodes. firefly did not have enough time in theatres to earn its true score. it didn't get enough publicity, i had to hear about it through word of mouth. either way, make a sequel and bring back firefly. My friends and i are all anxiously awaiting the next firefly season as i watch my copy of firefly literally daily, probably 3 episodes a day over and over. People say that the main quote of firefly 'you wont take the sky from me' is enough, but by cancelling the show they have taken the sky from me, Please Please bring back firefly, i need more.",Serenity
1590,Luvdrumin661,Excellent but yet sad......,10,3 December 2005,"Hard to believe that a show with so much potential was cancelled. And now an excellent movie version was spawned but yet again failed to break big numbers. This movie was a sign that great movies, that are story driven, can still be made. Unfortunately people didn't care enough about a good story to make it the overwhelming success it should have been. Lets hope that the public is kinder to the DVD release.....I saw Serenity 3 times in support of the franchise and can honestly say I loved it each time I saw it. The characters are unique and interesting. The story had many miles to go before ideas wore thin. I wish more people saw what I saw in the movie. Joss,with the help of his highly creative team, MAKE a sequel and ill gladly pay the $9.50....",Serenity
1591,orlin-3,Unbelievable experience!,10,5 December 2005,"I am thrilled by the movie. The FireFly series are by my opinion the best in the genre. ""Serenity"" sums it all up in a great movie and gives you the emotions, the feeling of the series, the essence of it. I really hope that this will not be just a send off, I am actually thinking of it as new beginning, new hope for FireFly. I hope to see the series continued, because there is so much more to say, the story is great, the crew is great, well the ship - it is great as well. See the movie, you won't regret it and if you can see the FireFly series as well. To sum it up, Serenity is a wonderful movie, you will like it, I promise!",Serenity

The TV series was great but was recently pulled. UK Magazine Empire are now taking votes for their 2006 Awards.Maybe if it does well at the awards they will make another. The creator is Joss Wheldon.

1593,sk1973,"In a better world, this would be Star Wars for the 21st. century.",9,10 December 2005,"Serenity is the first film in memory that has taken me back to that good and innocent feeling of adventure and action I'm sure many of us experienced upon watching our first Star Wars - whichever one it may be of the original trilogy. However, Josh Whedon manages a feat George Lucas never really has been able to: He writes intelligent and funny dialogue as well as knowing just which buttons to push for that inner child in us to have the time of his or her life. While the Star Wars-films of late have been pretty inane in everything but their special effects, Whedon knows how to get the best out of his actors - them being a pretty tight ensemble after their year(s) on Firefly - and gives a palpable sense of danger to the proceedings, aided by some quite surprising plot-developments I won't divulge here, so as not to spoil anything for those that have not yet had the good fortune to see the film. Absolutely recommended! Even if one hasn't seen the too short-lived television series Firefly, and might initially find the plot moving too fast, this is still Intelligent Entertainment 101.",Serenity
1594,mauirixxx,I enjoyed it,10,9 January 2006,"I for one have never even heard of the Firefly series until I saw the advertisements for Serenity. I unfortunately did not see the movie at the theaters (although now I kick myself for not doing so). A family friend raved about the movie then brought it over for us to watch, and we fell in love with the movie.The actors (Jayne is just too cool, my favorite scene was when he grabs a guy who runs up to him, flips the guy on his head, then drops him on his head) were excellent, the action was top notch - the actress playing River was VERY smooth in her fighting execution.After viewing the movie we started watching the series on DVD, and the more episodes I watch, the more I wish I caught this series back when it was on TV, more so because I want to catch all the TV series references made in the movie.The only thing I disliked about the movie was when they killed Wash, as it was so unexpected, especially after the craziness he had to go through to get everyone safely on the ground. I understand that characters die, and I have to admit, it really caught me off guard when it happened.Shepard dying didn't affect me too much, though I'm sure that if I saw the series BEFORE I saw the movie it would've affected me a lot more.And finally, the part where the reavers were explained how they came to be, when the lady explaining it finally gets overran by the reavers, her screams .. disturbed me. Excellent job. :) Overall, an excellent movie, one which I will be recommending to people for a long while.",Serenity
1595,romulan1974,"Star Wars, not Star Trek (any more)",3,11 December 2005,"As a series fan, I was severely disappointed. There is IMO two kind of SF fans: the ones that like huge battles and special effects, and the ones enjoying stories. Stories about people and their emotions, relationships, braveries, weaknesses, and all the other human stuff.Generalizing, the first one is the Star Wars type, the second the Star Trek type. The Firefly series used to be a quite convincing and enjoyable Star Trek. The movie ""Serenity"" has undergone a major change of style towards (a badly written) Star Wars. Not the characters and the development of their relationships lie in the foreground, but battles and special effects.This is not per se something bad. The problem is that, while the film loses a lot (friendship and love stories, the conflicts among crew-members, the development of characters are all gone), it does not add anything new. Bad story, no tension, many things left unexplained, no humour, okay effects, some of the nine main characters barely appearing, the others being extremely one-dimensional. Bad as a stand-alone movie, a catastrophe as series sequel. For the Star Trek type of fan (as myself), a double loss.",Serenity
1596,Sara1979,A movie that doesn't deserve the vote it's gotten,4,13 December 2005,"This was supposed to be a terrific movie, according to the votes at least. But I hate to say i agree. To be honest I don't understand how this mix of ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Ring"" has managed to appeal to an extent of vote 8. It's a messy, not very intelligent movie that is a rip of of the above mentioned movies. Bad guys look a little too much like orchs and the ""explanatory"" beginning is a little too much like ""Star Wars"". It's not a horrific movie in any way, it's a good action movie that's easy to watch if you don't feel like being smart that particular day - but it's not worth a vote of 8! Compared to other movies rated that high this one sucks.",Serenity

This film takes us on the losing side of battle where heroes fail and walk the fine line of morality. I think this film invites us back to sci-fi with light hearted comedy that make the sci-fi real. Extremely well written movie. joss Whedon does an excellent job on the pacing and writing. Unfortunately the show doesn't hold up as well. But if you have seen the show the movie is a big pay off and you will enjoy it! I love the series simply because the movie has let me look at the show in a different light. I understand the characters so much more now than the show really let on. See this one! I hope Joss is able to make this into a new movie franchise. Awesome!!!!",Serenity

We both didn't reach the end of the movie. It was boring simple sf movie and not worth watching till the end. I like a good storyline but this was really simple. She was activated by a children song than we couldn't stand it no longer and stopped watching. And i really watch a lot of movies every week. So don't spend your time on this one if you like an exciting movie. Hope you like this honest comment and i give it 3.

The visual effects are great and all characters seem to evoluate in real worlds and real space battles. The design of the spaceships are really impressive and even if the weapons seem to be not too far from ours it's ""credible"".^The casting is pretty good and the actors are all charismatic.

However, the special effects wasn't that bad.I'm frankly shocked that this is rated 8.1/10 , it should be 4.9/10Why? I think this movie goes for the fans. We others, really haven't hyped up as much.

If you have any interest in sci-fi, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, or just good, fun TV, watch the Firefly TV series and this movie.This movie is now my favorite movie of all time, beating off previous favorites of Lock Stock, and The Matrix.Even if you've never seen the series, this movie is a great one. Knowing the characters from the series only enhances your enjoyment. When I went to see this movie on opening night with 10 of my friends, not a single one of them didn't like the movie, and those that had seen some of the series were giddy all night.Serenity is a complicated movie, and that makes it really good. It's not just eye-candy. There is a lot complex plot, and it makes the whole world real. I can't wait to see it on DVD.",Serenity

1603,rbridgesmd,rare treat,9,25 December 2005,"OK... so I was bored and needed a movie to buy and watch... there was ""Serenity"" being pushed. Having lived through the ORIGINAL showing of Star Trek and Star Wars...(and Buck Rogers, and Battlestar and and and) and loving it... and on to Bab 5 and Farscape..this movie looked interesting... I never saw Firefly, or even heard about it...until Serenity.The word ""epiphany"" best sums up seeing Serenity. The casting, the plot, the dialogue, the CG ... hitting the play bottom slammed me back into my seat for a max-G ride that never quit.. never dulled... wanting me to see what the next twist was. The offbeat humor and style of language are great. The relentless foe in Serenity is chillingly cold , efficient and ruthless. Lethal and smart. Kudos for creativity and delivery.Reading how Fox ruined this reminds me of ABC and ""Call to Glory"". Star Trek survived by a loyal support base. For Firefly, Serenity is redemption and maybe a new lease on life. For now, enjoy this movie and the series for all that they are... a very special taste of original Sci-Fi that is sweet and special.",Serenity
1604,Meische,"quick thoughts on ""Serenity,"" a fantastic sci-fi flick",9,25 December 2005,"I Had never watched Firefly before I saw Serenity but remembered seeing previews for it a while back. My dad mentioned to me the day it came out that the New York Times had liked it so we decided to go see it. I really enjoyed it from the very beginning. Adam Baldwin's acting (Jayne) was a bit shaky in his first few scenes but he got his act together pretty quick. Overall I really loved the movie. I came out of the theatre punching my dad (he was a reaver, I had to) and shooting an imaginary pistol. For the record I'm 16. hehe...It seems most of the negative reviews of this movie that I;ve read say that the story has no new ideas and that it's been done so many times before. My dad and I are big movie buffs and I know either of us have seen a movie like Serenity. Maybe there was some crappy movie on the Sci-Fi channel that was shone once or twice about some physic in space or some 99 cents fantasy book that no one's read, but this is the first movie to pull it off.After seeing the movie I ordered Firefly and really enjoyed it. If you like the movie i recommend it.I gave it a 9 out of 10 because of a few hokey lines and a bit of bad acting.This is Meische, signing out.",Serenity
1605,mighty_joe_newlon,Props from a military weatherman,10,8 January 2006,"I strongly suggest seeing ""Serenity"". Joss Whedon's intro. on the extra material I found to be interesting, I also find the fan base to be inspiring. I have come to really like it and the TV series it spawned off of, ""Firefly"". I saw the last half of the movie a month ago or so it was interesting, didn't get hooked to it at that point. It wasn't until 3 weeks ago my room-mate gave me the ""Firefly"" DVD series to borrow, it transported me into the possible future. I finished watching all of them in a span of 3 days. Then bought 4 copies of the DVD, to mail to my buddies. The plot, characters, shooting, lighting, cussing in Chinese, actors especially actresses, the stories, they are all great. The series could have gone on for so much longer, just like ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"". It just really sucks how FOX displayed the airing of ""Firefly"", completely out of order. I don't think I would have watched it on TV the way it was presented, I didn't watch TV back in 2002 anyway, busy with military stuff.",Serenity
1606,jackmccoy-1,"Sad Movie, not because of the contents, but the end of a great story.",10,27 December 2005,"Like my usual track record, a show I really enjoy, 'Firefly' and a great movie, 'Serenity' are but glimpses of a classic and amazing science fiction series that equals the greats in story and content, but has suffered an amazing and unjust fate of other classics that stopped way short of what should have been. I would think that only very cra*** management could be responsible for something like this to happen, for I can think of no other reason. The cast is great, the stories are full of action, excitement, and comedy, and the special effects are phenomenal. It's weird, but I'll actually miss this story, and I'm normally not one to do that. If you like science fiction space adventures, 'Serenity' a must-see. You don't have to know anything about the original series either, as the movie gets you accustomed to the characters and events quickly. I do though recommend purchasing the entire series on DVD. 'Serenity' is an absolute classic and gets my highest recommendation.",Serenity
1607,chipnflint,Sorry I waited for the DVD,10,28 December 2005,I was a hit or miss fan of Firefly on its original run. Seeing it again on the Scifi Channel made me realize just how good it was. I heard a critic say the movie seemed like a TV episode. I decided to wait for the DVD. Now I am kicking myself for that decision. I think this movie really deserves to be on the big screen. I got the DVD as a Christmas gift. I have watched it twice so far and it's one of those rare movies that I will watch again and again. Whedon is a master storyteller. This movie takes you on a roller coaster ride. The action was huge. The humor was sprinkled through out the movie in just the right blend. The only thing missing on the DVD is an appearance of the Mutant Enemy. Please don't let this be the last of the Serenity crew!,Serenity
1608,rick-nelson,Serenity,9,29 December 2005,"This is a vastly underrated movie. This is a fun, action-packed movie that should be watched with friends. It has elements of a Western, with a shoot-'em-up feel. It has elements of a war movie, with exciting dogfight scenes. It has a new twist on the car chase scenes from crime movies. The main theme is the classic ""government gone wrong"", with our heroes battling both the government and the evil Reavers to enlighten the citizens. There is a romantic plot line underneath it all, along with some dissent among the crew. But in the end, everyone shows they are ready to give their lives in order to do what their captain feels is right.",Serenity
1609,carsten-63,Can't stop the signal,10,30 December 2005,"This certainly is one of the better movies of 2005 though I would imagine it doesn't fit everyone's taste. First and foremost the movie seems to have been made for fans of the firefly series. I watched the movie first and was pleasantly surprised. Sure the plot wasn't all thaaaat brilliant but then again the plot of Star Wars is far from being complex and episodes 4 to 6 are still very fine movies. I liked the characters, the humour and the fact that there was a bit of horror in it (the reavers). So, somewhat curious I watched the firefly series and then watched the movie again. This certainly makes a difference. If you have seen the series this movie catches you from the first minute and puts you through the whole scale of emotions. You will laugh at the sometimes hilarious dialogues, you will be thrilled by the action and you will be close to tears watching two members of the crew dying.When it comes to acting and actors - I can only say brilliant. Despite what some people may say the actors did a great job. However this is not the acting that you will be used to from Star Trek or Star Wars simply because the characters are much different from the characters mentioned in the movies / series above. In this context it's worth to mention that Nathan Fillion was featured as one of the top 10 overlooked performances of 2005 in an Associated Press Article.As a recommendation I can only say - if you watched the movie and thought: ""Well, it was OK"" then go, buy the series and watch the movie again. You'll love it.",Serenity

If I had heard about ""Serenity"" or seen it earlier, I would have seen it at least two more times and brought groups of friends with me. What gives?

Im not good with reviews, I can only tell people how much I love the characters and story of this series. I would love to see this come back (ive heard they are making a 2nd movie, but I doubt the series will ever return) but it wouldn't be the same without wash, and since he died in the movie...not sure how that would work out.All i can say, is watch the movie, rent/netflix the series, you wont be sorry.",Serenity

The camera work is awesome and shows the nature of the film as unique and unafraid. Joss Whedon is an amazing writer and director.

With the exception of the New Battlestar Galactica series, Sci-Fi has never made me feel so completely involved and immersed emotionally. I have recently found myself promoting this movie and the Firefly TV series with the fervor of a ""Supreme Leader of Geekhood"" (hopefully, in my own mind, not a title I have previously held) to all my family and friends. This movie and the series put U in a world where high tech meets low tech and the characters are approachable with REAL human problems easily identifiable to all viewers. Not an opinion, I have found that Sci-Fi fans and people who don't even like Star Wars like this movie. Joss Whedon makes you feel for each and every one of the characters.The only canceled TV series I know to be rallied to the movie screen. That has to say something of the quality of this story.

You actually can feel the different aspects of Humanity as seen in this space opera. Life is not always sweet and beautiful as in the the fantasy world. Too utopia in Star Trek. Too much computer graphics in Star Wars and very poor dialogue. The nearest rival to serenity is the excellent BABYLON 5 series. Let just hope we can see a sequel in the near future.

1617,yelnoc,Did I actually see the same movie?,3,5 January 2006,"I have to wonder if I actually saw the same movie that so many are raving about. Let me first say that I absolutely love Firefly. It took me a while to ""get it,"" but once I did I was absolutely hooked. I was delighted that Serenity was coming out, and was so looking forward to it. To my surprise and disappointment, it was so different from the series that I was appalled, and by the end never wanted to see it again. So many have said how much like the series it was, which led to my summary. How can you say that? Let me just toss out a few differences:1 - Simon did NOT rescue River from the Alliance. He made it clear that he had tried and failed, and that others had contacted him and brought her to Persephone for him. 2 - River was far too functional right after he rescued her. Yet it took the entire series before she was functional - when she first woke up she could barely do anything. 3 - Nearly every character was fundamentally different from in the series - Jayne being the only real exception. Let me just talk about Mal. In the series, he cared deeply about his crew and lived very carefully by a very strong ethical and moral code. Remember how he came back for Simon and River even though he didn't even like them, simply because they were crew. Or how he and Zoe returned the medicine they'd stolen. Or how he punished Jayne for turning on him, when Jayne had sold out River and Simon. Or even ordering Jayne from the table after the sexual crack about Kaylee. Yet in the movie, he as just plain mean. He very quickly turned on Simon and River, kicking them off the ship. He threatened to kill any of the crew who didn't support him completely. And so on. I could do a paragraph for each character, but I hope I've made my point.Now, on to specifics about the movie itself that were awful:1 - The lighting on the ship was darker and colder (grey blue) rather than the warmer natural lighting. It just made everything harsh, although I guess this ended up fitting the tone of the movie. 2 - Why would the Alliance plant info about Maranda in River? It doesn't jive with what they apparently were making her into. And why would finding Maranda ""cure"" her? There is no sense in that. 3 - Where were the blue-gloved men? I believe I saw them for 5 seconds, with no lines. They were vital to the series, terrifying River, yet effectively ignored in the movie. 4 - Why couldn't Serenity go around the Reavers, rather than through? C'mon, space is 3D. 5 - The Operative's actions were more suited to a James Bond villain than to a Joss Whedon creation - overblown and theatrical. 6 - Mal's war injury making him immune to the ""special"" move came across as a contrived convenience. 7 - Now that Shepard Book is dead, we'll never understand his background. 8 - Why had he even left the ship? There was no rationale for this. 9 - The movie does not stand on its own. People who didn't watch Firefly would be lost. 10 - Kaylee and Simon. Yes, sexual attraction was a part of the series, but there was also a romantic aspect, almost an innocence, to their relationship. It was interesting that he pulled that off, given how Kaylee came to be on Serenity (flashbacks in ""Out of Gas""). In the movie, it was just about sex. 11 - I could go on, but I'll jump to the worst: WHY KILL OFF TWO MAJOR CHARACTERS???? I didn't like Book dying, but it kind of fits the plot. But Wash? That was gratuitous, and the only reason I can think of is that Joss didn't want to be like Trek and others who have from time to time killed off major characters, but always one by one. There was NO POINT TO KILLING HIM OFF!!Sigh. I still love Firefly, and still watch it over and over, but now I pine for what might've been. Serenity was not shiny - Joss, if you ever do get another chance at this, I'd take it as a kindness if you'd return to the love, life, and humanity of the series. I'm fair sure you missed the mark badly on this one, and I'll have to sit a spell to get over my sorrow.Signed,A saddened Browncoat, who feels like he ended up on the losing side, but not the wrong side.",Serenity

1619,dpg007007,"Good Movie, yet DISAPPOINTING!...",5,7 January 2006,"Hey look, I can understand (sort of) that Joss was looking for closure, but he could have done it so much better. I was a HUGE Firefly fan, and was completely sold on the characters in the series and their many mysteries. That is what made the series great ... But the movie... The movie is pretty good (with good acting and special effects), but the plot left me asking WHY all that was there (in terms of characters) wasn't developed so much more. I'm surprised so many fans gave this movie a '10', since Joss utterly destroys central characters in the end (including one of the series' funniest). Ron Glass' role was disappointing, and could have been developed so much more (e.g., his unexplained past -- maybe as a secret gov't agent who renounced his craft or something like that). Likewise with Inara's past/career choices. In my opinion, Joss has obliterated the series, damaging it to a point of no possible recovery. That's really disappointing. All that for a fairly insubstantial story line of 'getting the message out' (in an already cynical galaxy). Mr. Universe's character was a little too flaky/unbelievable in the whole story. (The crew could have at least hijacked a central comm. hub to get their message out). And I don't think it was worth the losses that were taken (especially to that crew). I think maybe Joss overstepped his bounds here. I was very happy to see River's character developed (she definitely deserves an acting award for her role), but even in her character I was expecting more (unexpected) capabilities (e.g., psychic warfare abilities, etc.). The character was there for it to be developed (in fact, she was perfect for it). I hate to say it, but I liked the TV series A LOT better, and I pretty much wish I hadn't seen this movie (that's how badly it destroys things)... I guess I'll have to pretend it never happened!... There, that's better! Maybe I'll write my own version of the story.",Serenity
1620,Stalker1869,My thoughts of the movie!,10,8 January 2006,"I absolutely loved the movie! Of course there were some sad parts where some of my favorite characters had to bite the dust and all, but over all it rocked! I really would love there to be another movie and all that, because Inara and Mal really need to just get together because the sexual tension is so bad I could cut it with a knife! I would have to say that the outtakes on the DVD were absolutely hilarious and there were some nifty deleted scenes that I wish were not deleted! My sister got me hooked on the series so I just had to see the movie and was not disappointed! I just felt all horrible inside when I heard they weren't continuing the series. Darn you FOX for playing the episodes out of order and getting this awesome series canceled!! I bet you are regretting it! If you haven't seen the movie yet, you should, but watch the series first because the movie makes a lot more sense if you do! Well anyway,the movie rocked and explained a few things, so here's hoping for another one!",Serenity
1621,rowdypc247,Serenity SHOULD win plenty of awards for its excellence.,10,15 January 2006,"""Serenity"" was an excellent movie adaptation of a refreshingly ""different"" TV series, ""Firefly"", which was very unfortunately canceled. Director Joss Whedon's ""past meets future"" style of a universe seems a little unusual, but his directing talent and his obscure yet incredibly talented cast of actors and actresses bring this world to life and tell a tale of clinging to one's morality in very heroic ways in the midst of struggling to survive. Not very often does a movie come along that can be watched over and over and truly inspire and entertain each and every time that it is watched.Serenity was utterly flawless in its storyline and Joss Whedon's execution of the script was masterful, considering his budget as opposed to its competing box office productions. The movie explained things left unexplained by the TV series and the story flowed smoothly throughout its entire course. The script was excellent and the movie ended openly, without finality, as so many movies do nowadays, leaving ample room for more and leaving fans and viewers wanting and hoping for more in the form of a sequel or more Firefly. It leaves you with a strong desire to see the crew of the Serenity kick more Alliance butt in the future. If you haven't seen the series of Firefly yet, get a copy from Amazon.com and enjoy. I only hope that Joss Whedon will be allowed by someone, ""anyone"", to produce more episodes of Firefly in the future and continue where Serenity left us all hoping for more. With all of the mindless, meaningless, amoral ""slot filling"" on television currently, it would be a waste to let such a refreshing and unique story like the story of Captain Malcolm Reynolds and the Serenity die. At the very least, there is a whole season worth of TV shows and a great movie, but it would be great if there was more.As a Firefly and Serenity fan, I sincerely hope that Joss Whedon will be allowed to produce more as either a sequel to Serenity or even better, another couple of seasons of Firefly at the very least. I see so many directions this story can take, and they are all good.In my opinion, this movie, Serenity, along with its director, Joss Whedon, and its fantastic cast should ALL win awards in recognition of its excellent production.",Serenity
1622,akahamehamana-nikster,Simply Brilliant,10,29 May 2006,"It's really simple to make a good Sci-Fi movie: Get an interesting world together, add an interesting story line, add wonderful characters and good actors and some good crunchy action - and there you go! This film makes it appear easy. The special effects don't need to be that big-budget either - they were adequate, but it really didn't take anything from the movie. The scenery and backdrops on the other hand were breathtakingly beautiful. Oh, set design in general was brilliant.This movie ""suffers"" from an overabundance of ideas. Where big budget Hollywood movies are straining to make an interesting story out of one or two ideas, this one just bursts with imagination. There is enough material in there to make a TV series over several seasons. I loved that - but if you like to get everything that happens explained in painstaking detail it's not for you. There is a real depth to the world depicted in the movie - it's not just a vehicle to get a message across. Regarding some comments in the forum: I do have a feeling that I missed loads of jokes because I am not a native English speaker. Good so I get to enjoy it again, this time with subtitles. The dialog I did understand rather than just guess from context was awesome. Smart and funny. Never lame.I did not know anything about Firefly before reading the forums here, so no need to know that to enjoy the movie - it does explain though why there is this plethora of story-lines packed into this film.",Serenity
1623,markys_pea,Serenity is a wonderful movie...,10,23 March 2007,"This is a movie that everyone should see at least once if not more in their lifetime. What I liked most about the story was the love & trust that was shown throughout. This theme was carried out in various ways by each character. There was plenty of action to keep me on the edge of my seat. There were also times that I ended up in tears. The cast that came over from the Firefly TV series worked well together as if they were a family, not a crew on a ship. The new additions were a big surprise. I had always wondered what Reavers were & in seeing this movie, I had my chance to find out. I hated for the movie to end. If you haven't yet seen Serenity, you really should. It's a wonderful movie! Mr. Universe was right in saying that ""You can't stop the signal."" It's still being carried on today.",Serenity
1624,holman1313,Nothing special,5,16 January 2006,"Nothing better than an average SciFi channel movie. I saw the 8.0 rating the movie had received from the 32,000 voters and thought it would be a good movie, but boy was I wrong. I'm a huge science fiction fan and this movie was nothing special. The script was pretty bad, I understand that this is set in the future but I highly doubt that the future of language includes a type of grammar-less, wild-west mix. I enjoyed the characters of the Operative/Assassin and Enora, but I wouldn't credit any other member of the cast with doing a good job. In addition, the whole plot seems underdeveloped; aspects of the story are picked up and dropped too quickly to create cohesion. Very disappointing.",Serenity
1625,Daddyo1111,MUST SEE - not your ordinary sci-fi adventure,10,16 January 2006,"You will undoubtedly come up with your own description of Serenity after seeing this film. Mine is Brisco County Jr. meets Ratchet & Clank meets American Chopper. This is definitely NOT your run-of-the-mill sci-fi flick!My first viewing of the movie was spent wondering ""Where have I seen that actor before?"". The cast is superb - no big names overwhelm your attention allowing you to fully enjoy the ensemble as intended.Second time around, I realized why I like this movie so much. Serenity excels by bringing a perfect mix of intelligent, thought-provoking story and Wild West action. I cannot watch a film that ""requires"" me to think, yet Serenity requires close attention to detail - the key is the film keeps moving, very quickly, all the while.Tying it all together are special effects and humor that really work. I was expecting ""Star Wars"" slick, however the effects used, while sophisticated, felt so much more real. The humor, in comparison to Star Wars, is very Han Solo-like (""I'd rather kiss a Wookie."" ""I can arrange that!"") - a treasure of spur-of-the-moment throw-away lines that are flat out funny!Echoing another comment, this is a film you will need to and WANT to watch again and again. You will. And you will enjoy it...",Serenity
1626,dawsoncooper,Quality,10,16 January 2006,"Yes, really, all that is needed is one word to describe the directorial debut of ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"" legend, Joss Whedon.

I could harp on about the amazing plot, the uniformly excellent performances, the heart-in-mouth, edge-of-your-seat action set-pieces, the brilliant dialogue ...... but i won't. Suffice to say, all you really need to do to appreciate this film is WATCH IT.Newbies, fear not. I hadn't experienced the TV show on which the movie is based (""Firefly"") before I saw ""Serenity"" so it's completely accessible. But fans of the show won't be disappointed either (although, if you're a fan of the show and haven't seen ""Serenity"" yet then shame on you).And, just to get a little dig in, anyone who has deluded themselves into thinking the ""Star Wars"" prequels were anything other than complete rubbish - see ""Serenity"" and observe how proper sci-fi should be done.So go on, see it.

Only the experience of watching this movie can truly be captured. If you are familiar with the TV show and haven't seen the movie, you are a disgrace and should be beaten with a stick. You will cry when you see Shepard Book die and you will sob when Wash dies, but you will also rejoice when the crippled Serenity launches into the air again, reborn from the ashes of violence. The point of this movie is to see what life on the ragged edge, fiction or not, may be like someday for all of us in the future.",Serenity
1628,josua-nel,What an experience,9,21 January 2006,"Josh Whedon is a master at the art of story telling. Combining the series and the movie in such a manner that a first time viewer can follow the story line.If you enjoyed Buffy, Angel or even West Wing this ones for you. If I have to I will be buying as many copies as I can even here in darkest Africa to make this part of my collection.It is a sad moment when you realise that this is the end of an era and that the tales will never be fully explored further. Why can Hollywood not cotton onto the fact that you need good writers to tell the story and not special effects. If more movies were of this calibre I would be fat from popcorn and raspberry slushies.Can't stop the signal!",Serenity
1629,easterkat-1,Not too sure about this one.,4,7 January 2007,"I'm a big fan of ""Firefly"", the series on which this film is based. I never saw it when it was on television but several friends recommended the DVDs to me, so I finally rented them. The series is absolutely fantastic--full of great writing, fully realized characters and interesting situations. The movie? Not so much.My primary objection to the film is the dialogue and the manner in which it's delivered. The actors, as attractive and engaging as they were in the series, here feel more like statues delivering lines from cue cards. Many of the conversations feel forced and awkward. Given that it's the same Western-tinged dialogue (peppered with Chinese phrases) that we heard in the TV series, why does it sound so strange in the film? I found myself cringing at the entire opening scene, especially the exchanges between Mal and Wash and then Mal and Kaylee. Were they not given time to rehearse before the cameras rolled? Along the same lines as the above, I really cringed at the performances of a few of the actors. Jewel Staite's Kaylee comes across as nothing more than a jumpy mouse, and Summer Glau does some of the worst ""crazy"" acting I've seen on film in a while. And while I'm aware that Captain Reynolds is supposed to be stressed and angry most of the time, it'd be nice if Nathan Fillion could unclench that jaw once in a blue moon. He seems to deliver every line through gritted teeth. (He sure is nice to look at, though.) My last complaint is the seemingly uncharacteristic behavior of a couple of the characters. **SPOILERS** When Zoe watched her husband die and just a few minutes later turned into Robot the Reaver Killer, I didn't buy it. Yeah, I get that she's a dedicated soldier and takes her job seriously. But Gina Torres is a talented actress--she should have been given a grief scene somewhere between Wash's death and the Reaver standoff. Then there's Simon's sudden interest in Kaylee during the firefight which basically amounts to, ""Since we're about to die, I regret that we never did it."" Wow. That's...heartwarming. We saw Kaylee pine for Simon on multiple occasions but there was never any indication that it was a mutual attraction, so their whole exchange seemed to come from nowhere. (Also, their dialogue in that scene is awful. ""You mean to say...sex?"" ""I mean to say."" Ugh.) I wish the things I mentioned above hadn't detracted from my overall enjoyment of the film. I did appreciate the performance of Chiwitel Ejiofor who, despite being saddled with some very clichéd lines, still came off with the right mixture of chilliness and charm. I also enjoyed the general look of the film--good costumes, sets and effects throughout. Unfortunately, though, the underwhelming performances and stilted dialogue just ruined the whole thing for me.",Serenity
1630,oldskeptic,Uncommon quality,10,16 February 2007,"I heard various comments about this film before it came out. I did a little research, and came across the FireFly universe. Before watching the movie, I watched all the episodes of the defunct TV series (if I ever meet the idiot that pulled the plug on FireFly . . . ).The series is, in my opinion, without equal. The movie does a good job balancing between providing a ""complete"" story for new viewers, and providing fans of the TV series with a good fix. Because it's so hard to describe, I won't go into particulars.I will say that all of the actors were really great in both the series and the movie. They complement the excellent writing, and pull off a continuity of story and characters that I've never seen in any other TV-to-movie transition. I was particularly impressed with the bad guy. I had seen him in Love Actually, and the contrast of his action to the likable persona worked very well. I would have perhaps liked a few more mysteries revealed, especially since I'm skeptical a sequel will be made. Still, one can hope.As I said, I cannot do justice to the movie by describing any aspects of it. I can say that I have not met anyone who has watched the TV series that did not: 1) fall in love with it, and 2) loved the movie.Do yourself a favor. Rent the series, then watch the movie.

I love the writing, the storyline, the cast, and everything it all stands for. Joss Whedon is every bit as masterful a story teller and visionary for the future as Roddenberry. I am a huge Star Trek fan, especially Next Generation. I have identified so much with the cast of STNG over the years. Truly as if they were real people rather than just characters. Jean-Luc Picard has been my hero for years. When you watch these shows you feel them as well as see them. The same thing....and THEN some is the case with Firefly and Serenity. Truly family is what is the message. It was nothing less than a huge insult and slap in the face, when the ""braintrust"" at Fox canceled Firefly....but hey Fox? Thank you. We now have a huge fan-base (browncoats) and we are all family. And thank you Universal for the movie. Please make sure we get more Serenity movies and PLEASE someone (SciFi channel??) Can we please get new episodes back on the TV airwaves. If you all don't know by now......WE WILL WATCH IT!!! Who ever heard of a canceled TV show becoming a smash hit movie??

The character River was fascinating, you just wanted to look into her brain, what else can she do?! Joss Whedon's creative writing and character pairings give you what you crave without giving too much. If you enjoy Science Fiction, this will pique your interests. A romantic and delicious specimen!

Money was well spent on special effects and the story was mildly intriguing, but not special. It's worth renting but NOT enough to plunk down $$$ at the local movie house.All of the previous gushing reviews, I have noticed, were posted after a ""special showing"" of the film in the summer of 2005 so I discount them all as being sycophantic in nature, entered by uberfans of Firefly. That's fine, but when this flick slowly disappears into the rental racks at minor video store thousands of those uberfans will reminisce about a movie which only grows better...in their imaginations!.",Serenity

Even though i had never heard of firefly i had no problem following what was going on and those who failed to do so must only like films where you are spoon fed the obvious. This is such an addictive film and it was such a pity that it got a limited release in the UK so that so few people got to see it. The DVD is released in two weeks here and i can't wait not only to watch it again myself but to finally show it to every one i know as i have been talking about it for months.

Yes, I know, low budget movie but having watched it, it looked anything but low budget. I really think you guys should have thrown a lot more money at it for marketing. Take the marketing department and make sure they get their butts kicked. This movie appeals to me - the Matrix, Lord of the Ring, fanatic. Not Buffy... I wonder how well the Matrix would have done if they advertised that the Director was one and the same as Teletubbies or Barney... Common guys re-release the movie with a decent marketing campaign.

1636,jasonprice-2,"Weird at first, but good after watching firefly",9,4 September 2006,"I was moderately confused for the first little bit of the movie, but I remained entertained. After that, I realized that it must be a fan movie. Meaning that it was made for the fans.Well, Yes and no.I would say in the same way that Star Trek came back to life, so did Firefly. The big miracle and issue is that Firefly did it in such a shortened time frame. Fewer episodes, less time to the big screen... These things did not necessarily help.What I can say after all of it is this.I watched the movie first. Enjoyed myself, but was not ""blown away"". Then the magic started. I looked up what the deal was with the series as I had dismissed Firefly without ever seeing it on TV. I immediately figured that there was a lot of important back story that was in the series, so I watched all 14 episodes. LOVED IT!!! I want to say even more than Star Trek or the current BSG! Well, the after effect of seeing the TV series cleared so many things up that I immediately found a whole new appreciation for the movie.As to what I believe this could become? It is totally conceivable that all of the positive and negative commentary on Serenity will draw even more people to watch the series, either before or after watching the movie. If this happens (And it happened to me. I borrowed the movie from my brother and the series from someone else), then it will easily drive a second movie. The trick will be that you may need to watch the TV series to get more or the most out of the movie. I had to and I don't regret one minute spent doing it.",Serenity
1637,aki-alatalo-1,Hamburger scifi,4,22 February 2006,"I wasn't totally aware of what kind of movie it would be, but I think that I expected a bit more from the movie.It's not a bad movie at all, but it's not good one either. The biggest bad mistake in the movie is that it pretty much sums up all the clichés of sci-fi movies, which you will notice in the beginning when they're talking ""star trek"" language regarding the ship and it's parts. I wonder how much fun did the writers have when figuring out the most complicated sounding words to describe the workaround of the ship and it's engine, etc.Most of the film was boring, because it was predictable. There were rare things that I could not predict, and a lot of illogical and unexplained things too. In the end, they crash the spaceship in the hangar, and they have all reavers after their heads, and they just suddenly end up (being chased, so not much time to search for anything) into a place that is easy to defend, and offers access to the place they were originally heading for, and it's the only way, too.The acting was mediocre most of the times, but I can't say it would've been really bad. Most of the ""important lines"" were so cliché that I had hart time looking at the serious faces of actors letting out garbage like that.Now this might sound a bit harsh, but there would be lots of things to complain about, but it would most likely give a wrong idea of the movie. I liked it, mainly because I like sci-fi and such themes a lot in movies. I would've given it three if I didn't fancy Sci-Fi.It's a nice snack, but don't expect too much if you're going to see it. Most of the hamburger eating Americans will buy it in the first place, because there's too much grease in their heads and they are unable to think while watching a movie, which is the proper attitude to watch this movie, and that is because it loses it's credibility if you actually start to think.(oh, and this wasn't offensive against Americans, it's just that your hamburger culture is the perfect describing symbol in the sentence I used)",Serenity

1639,Rick_Big_Bad_Wolf_Slade,The Browncoats ride again,10,2 March 2006,"Joss Whedon's shorted lived television series Firefly, upon which Serenity is based, never made it to TV in this country (Great Britain). Instead I caught it on DVD and instantly fell in love with Firefly and her crew with it's complex characters and multi layered mythology, this fantastical science fiction universe seemed real and organic. It was not a sterilised clean Starfleet world with prime directives and an ever increasing role call of humanoid aliens, in fact in the 'Verse' there are no know alien races at all. It was a dirty nasty world, a frontier world where more often than not problems are solved not with diplomacy but at gunpoint. The show in the states received excellent reviews from both critics and fans and was being labelled as a sure fire hit. With such positive reaction the Fox channel did what they always do with new and exciting sci-fi series, they cancelled it, without even bothering to show all of 14 completed episodes.And that's where the story should of ended. Firefly should of joined the ever increasing list of quality sci-fi/fantasy TV series which end prematurely and without apparent reason (to this list you should add series like Enterprise, Brimstone and Channel 4's excellent vampire series Ultraviolet). However a combination of Joss Whedon, DVD sales, online buzz and the never ending support of the Browncoats (the name given to the hardcore fans of the show) enabled the battered Firefly to raise Phoenix like from the flames and Serenity was born.The story picks up a short time after the series ended and continues the adventures of Capt. Malcolm 'Mal' Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and his crew onboard the Firefly class ship Serenity. The film focus is on River Tam (Summer Glau) a young and gifted girl who has been experimented on by the ruling alliance power to be turned into a living weapon complete with psychic powers amazing combat training. She is rescued buy her brother Dr. Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and the two of them find sanctuary onboard Serenity. The alliance, fearing that River may have information that could destroy them, send an cold and ruthless operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who will stop nothing to retrieve her.Joss Whedon has created a wonderful yet real universe that he has filled with great characters. His decision not to recast but to use the same actors he used in the series works wonderfully. These actors know these characters inside and out and you get a very real feeling that the cast care as much about them as the legion of Browncoats who fought to save the show. There is not one bad performance from any of the main cast but the real standouts are Nathan Fillion and Summer Glau. In Fillion's Mal we have a Han Solo for the 21st Century. His combination of matinée idol looks and easy charm positively scream Harrison Ford in his Star Wars days. Mix with this an amazing intensity and comic timing that any leading man in Hollywood would kill for and Fillion is truly a rising star to look out for (New Indiana Jones?). Summer Glau bring an amazing sweetness and naivety to a character that could of so easily been an archetypal 'crazy girl'.In all Serenity is an action packed fun filled romp of a sci-fi movie that will not disappoint. See it you owe it to yourself. And Joss if you ever read this Thank You they will ""never take the sky from me"".",Serenity
1640,rikkys,Don't believe the hype!,5,28 February 2006,"An extra warning this does contain a spoiler- It was hard for me to watch this film without having the preconceived notion it was going to be a good flick,after all it had been described by some critics as being the best film of 2005 being an avid sci-fi fan this film was indeed my kind of film.After viewing the first 25 mins my friends and I chatted and came to the same conclusion,it gave the impression of a very average space romp,it didn't feel like movie more like an episode of andromeda,the mostly unknown cast gave average performances slightly tongue in cheek but not obvious enough to be funny if you imagine the kind of banter and jokes from an episode of stargate sg1 you'll know what I mean-but less entertaining,its hard to care about any of the characters as they are so obviously pretending to act tough,they give the film a feeling of unreality which spoils the tense moments.The plot should have been the films strong point,the film keeps its secrets pretty close to its belt, then treats you to an interplanetary conspiracy which should have been great,but alas the result is that a lot of the population are turned into flesh eating zombis with superhuman strength ""original"" and the crew of serenity must stop this happening again. Cue the hand to hand fight scenes which are well choreographed but don't seem to fit into the film,it seems at set points the writer has said we'll put a fight scene here because nothing has happened for 25 minutes,there are also a couple of large space shootouts which wouldn't look out of place in an episode of enterprise. If your not a sci-fi fan watch this film expecting an all round good film I think you'll be disappointed,if you are a sci-fi fan and you just want the equivalent of a two part episode of any popular sci-fi series you may enjoy.For die hard sci-fi fans only,but not this one :(",Serenity
1641,rickymanx27,Not Worth to See,4,20 March 2006,"I was lucky enough to have a brain in good state when the TV series of Firefly started, so I was able to catch my own way and NOT SEE THAT Crappy Series. Watch it for any longer would have produce damage to my mental health. If this ""Serenity"" is indeed a Phoenix from the ashes, then beware, we could all be doomed. Joss has never created anything, it's just a bunch of bullshit. There's no way to accept space cowboys and Hill Billies with regular shotguns, between spaceships and intergalactic governments. Anyway, how could there be ""fans"" of a show that lasted just a few chapters. Obviously you are not being serious. I would never watch Firefly again, to see a whole movie of the same...crap If you are so easy to become a fan of something as absurd as firefly, then that explain the existence of lame TV series such as Buffy, Charmed, among others. This movie is just another one for a lot that no one will ever remember.",Serenity
1642,sidderek,A real treat for Wheedon fans,10,7 March 2006,"As a long-time fan of the Buffy/Angel/Firefly series, I was delighted to hear about the release of Serenity as a movie. Even more delighted that it was so good! The story does not demand prior knowledge of the Firefly series (although I think that it helps!)and contains loads of action, humour and pathos.The action sequences are tremendous and rank with anything done in any of his earlier work.The actors do fit in to their respective roles with ease, and it is easy to see that they really enjoy the experience of working with Joss Wheedon again.The writing is as sharp as you could wish for and the acting is great. A real treat indeed.Here's to the hope for Serenity II and maybe an Angel or Buffy movie as well?",Serenity
1643,wicca303,"Fantastic, what an amazing journey!",10,13 March 2006,"I didn't know anything about Firefly/Serenity before I saw this film. It sounded a little bit strange when described, but it was Joss Whedon so it couldn't be all bad. My friend's exact words were ""it's a western set in space"", I really wasn't convinced, but after the first 5 minutes I realised it was so much more than that, I was hooked! Here were characters I could really care about, that feeling is what makes this movie. You've still got all the usual stuff: action, adventure, romance, comedy, and anything else you could want but it's the characters who really capture your heart.The story and dialogue are wonderful, and the cast are fabulous, they might say they're not big name actors, but they're certainly big stars to anyone who loves this movie. I went back three times to see this at the cinema, and bought the TV show Firefly box-set after seeing the film once, now I've got the DVD, and already i'm worried about wearing it out. Any film that can make me run through every emotion i've got has to be worth seeing. I laughed, cried, cheered, gasped, hid my face and bounced on the edge of my seat, and when I left the cinema I felt as if maybe I was part of something bigger than what I'd just seen.It's really hard to describe this movie and do it justice, but i'll do my best. This movie is set about 500 years in the future, we've exhausted Earths resources and moved out to a new solar system, a new set of planets. But that is not what this movie's about, It's about ordinary people trying to survive, doing what they have to so they can get by, living where the world is lots of planets, your crew is your family and home is a ship called 'Serenity'. Serenity is owned by Captain Malcolm Reynolds, he lives there with his crew, Zoe his 2nd in command, her husband Wash the pilot, ships mechanic Kay Leigh, hired gun Jayne, and Simon the ships medic, there's also the Simon's younger sister River (a psychic who's a fugitive from the alliance), for want of a better term they're smugglers who'll take any job offered legal or otherwise. This film is about happens when the alliance come looking for the River. That's all I can really say without giving anything away. So go see it for yourself, you won't regret it and welcome to the 'verse'.",Serenity
1644,jcaulfield-1,More great work from Joss,10,8 October 2006,"I am also, or should i say was a great follower of Joss's TV workings with Buffy, Angel & Firefly and i was not disappointed with this film adaptation and am hopeful of joss doing a sequel !!! A great film was created with a fine cast of familiar faces from all three like  Caleb (Nathan Fillion) from Buffy , Jasmine (Gina Torres) & Marcus Hamilton (Adam Baldwin) from Angel and all three of witch were in Firefly with a hand full of others from the film . This is defiantly 1 to watch in 5.1 as sound affects are great, my mum walked in to the room as a gun went off and dropped my tea, i did have it turned up a bit ... lol) Looking forward to Wonder Woman and much much more from Mr Whedon ...",Serenity
1645,dragoness43,not as good as the show,2,19 March 2006,"I was so excited to see this movie after becoming an avid fan of the firefly series but this movie just didn't make the cut. All of the aspects that made firefly great were gone. The movie was far too dark and modern feeling. The show had a perfect touch of the old west along with the modernized spaceships and such but this movie lacked western feel altogether. There is little humor and the characters related in a very forced and unrealistic manner. There is zero camaraderie and the entire focus of the story is on river, which is where the whole thing goes wrong. The slaughter of 2 main characters is pointless and horrible and the Inara/ Mal relationship is unbelievable because we get no sense of her character. Why Kaylee would like Simon is beyond anyone's comprehension who hasn't seen the show. He hardly has any substance. If there was any hope this would revive the show, it's been quashed. This movie hurts for any true fan. I don't see why anyone liked it.",Serenity
1646,cesar-48,I like movies... they let me get away for a while...,10,23 March 2006,"I always think that people rate films too seriously... They are intended for entertainment. We are not supposed to analyze movies too seriously, if they do not make sense with our current reality then let them be.Rating with numbers is too damn analitical and mathematical and to rate how much fun you had here and there is like rating beauty... and beauty is in the eye of the beholder.Having said that, I liked this movie... damn, I like every movie I watch... they take me away for a while into another dimension, whether they are Sci-Fi, horror, comedy, thriller, etc...Watch this movie and don't trust any comment saying that this was a good, excellent or bad movie. Have fun while watching it and don't analyze acting, plot or try to make sense of what is happening in the movie... it is a movie after all !!!",Serenity
1647,dragongal,Serenity was awesome!,8,24 March 2006,"It has the same name as me! It is sci-fi. It was pretty cool!The actor and actresses do some cool stunts,like Summer which plays River can kick butt.I liked the Chinese words even though I don't know what they mean.I like Asian things, they are great!I did miss your Firefly series but,I saw the movie.I wish that I knew some martial arts,but I'm not sure I could learn any.I do not write anything rude and inappropriate.NEVER would I!I like movies.I like some Sci-fi movies, for instance,Serenity or Bloodrayne.I think action, adventure, Comedy, historical,and horror are excellent!You should make some of those movies like Serenity.I saw that some people liked the Firefly series.",Serenity
1648,mikechance1983,this is a must see film.,10,24 March 2006,"got this film 3 weeks ago having heard good reviews in newspapers etc, wasn't expecting much, how wrong i was. this film had me hooked right from the start and even when it was over i wanted to watch it all over again.this is the movie the star wars prequels should have been, giving us characters we can identify with and a story line you think you've figured out then takes a completely different direction.joss wheadon, i thank you for not giving up on your dream of firefly, after seeing this i promptly bought the firefly dvds. all i can hope is that universal commission a sequel to this amazing movie - and fast.""they can't stop the signal Mal, they can never stop the signal""",Serenity

1650,p-lazenby,One of the best I've seen for awhile,10,25 March 2006,"No movie can get a full 10 but I can't do 9.8 etc I have to use 9.For awhile I had been going to see movies where I was disappointed since the trailer made it seem to be an excellent movie but when I saw it turned out to be crap, however, Serenity was a movie that grabbed my attention and proved not be a waste of money.All the way through it had my full attention, i didn't start playing with my finger nails and such. All the actors knew what they were doing and made the characters believable people. This was because they had played these people before in TV show Firefly, which had only lasted one series even though it was popular.I had not heard of Firefly before so I couldn't pick holes. The humor stayed their most of the way through except for serious scenes like near the end, I'm not going to go into detail.I have seen again and again since it's release onto DVD and it will stay high up in the list of my favourite movies.After seeing Firefly I could see the odd bits where the set is slightly different, alliance uniforms are different which would be expected, alliance ships are different. All of this doesn't really matter when you see the movie.It was well worth me paying to see it.",Serenity
1651,FMWoodyard,"Very clever, action packed and the wittiest banter in any film i've",10,27 March 2006,"Let's set the record straight, yes this is a space western, but don't let that put you off, it's so much more.Whedon's trademark wit and wisdom is present throughout this beautifully shot and moving film and anyone that liked any of his other projects, i.e, Buffy the Vampire slayer/ Angel and of course Firefly, will love this.The film shows an intriguing vision of the future but parallels are easy to make with current world situations. The story is gripping and although familiarity with Firefly is helpful and will add to your enjoyment of the movie, it isn't necessary.In short, this is a film lover's dream, everything from the sets and costumes to the dialogue and special effects. Even those that generally stay away from sci-fi will get something from this movie.",Serenity
