0,TheLittleSongbird,"Predictable, but it is a sweet and fun movie",8,27 April 2010,"I don't think The Mighty Ducks is a masterpiece in any shape or form, but it is an enjoyable film. I do agree that it is predictable, the plot is nothing particularly special and the ending especially doesn't really hold any surprises. But it is nicely filmed, with evergreen cinematography and pretty scenery and the music is pleasant. The script is good on the most part, there are some humorous parts but it is also somewhat touching, and the director Stephen Herek pitches the humour and melodrama at the right level. And the acting is spirited, with Emilio Estevez charming, dignified and fun as the disgraced lawyer who has to coach the worst ice hockey team and Joss Ackland solid as Hans. Also the ice-hockey scenes are done with just the right amount of flair. Overall, a sweet and fun movie, even with the predictable plot it is worth seeing. 8/10 Bethany Cox",The Mighty Ducks
1,SnoopyStyle,nice family movie,7,5 March 2015,"Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) was once a star of his peewee hockey team but he hit the post, lost the championship game and disappointed Coach Jack Reilly (Lane Smith). He is now a slick Minneapolis defense attorney. After a drunk driving arrest, his boss works out a community service plea with the court for him to coach the worst 0-9 peewee hockey team.This is the 'Bad News Bears' in the form of a hockey team. Averman even does the ""Hey batter batter..."" It doesn't have quite the same edge or the same originality. Although getting inspiration from a great movie is not necessarily a bad idea. It has the fun and a couple of recognizable names in the young faces. Gordon himself has a compelling history which is more than just being a drunk. It's a good feel-good kids movie.",The Mighty Ducks
2,Hitchcoc,"If You Ignore the Utter Impossibilities, It Is Fun",8,29 December 2016,"I'm from Minnesota and I have a friend who had a small part in this film. He played the cop who pulls Gordon Bombay over when he gets the DUI. If you look at this as a relationship movie, with Bombay trying to get back his self respect, it is great fun. The kids are cute and funny. They have been losers their whole live and they now have the opportunity for success. The writers throw in some things that are a bit too much. Bombay ends up coaching against a guy who humiliated him as a child when he missed a penalty shot (by the way, why wasn't the score tied after he missed it since a goal would have won the game?). Hockey is a unique sport. Just the skating is a great challenge. Those kids could barely stand on skates, yet they becomes skilled skaters after a couple weeks. Those other teams were light year ahead. Also, those ridiculous plays that they run just won't happen. And the big guy with the slap shot. So we need to ignore that because this whole thing is fantasy. Even the top hockey newspaper writing feature articles on a peewee team is just not going to happen. Nevertheless, if I take it at face value, it's a hoot.",The Mighty Ducks
3,gavin6942,Fun Movie To Make You Feel Like a Kid,7,2 May 2013,"A self-centered lawyer (Emilio Estvez) is sentenced to community service coaching a rag tag youth hockey team.I am not going to say this is an amazing movie, because really it is nothing all that special. No great directing, no great acting (Estevez is awesome, but not necessarily a good actor). The script is completely by the book and predictable all the way. But the intent was never to make a masterpiece or an award-winner. It is just a fun movie for kids and adults who like to feel like kids.All I really want to write here is: I wonder if Bill Murray had gotten the role of Gordon Bombay, how would that have been different? I think it would have been a better movie, but what do I know? Maybe Murray would have been too goofy or too serious. He is not ""lovable"" like Estevez is. Either way, it is a movie I would love to see.",The Mighty Ducks
4,lee_eisenberg,typical of this genre,4,1 February 2008,"I pretty much have no respect for movies like ""The Mighty Ducks"". OK, so it's basically a harmless movie. But stories of the underdog figuring out a way to win against all odds has long since turned into a cliché (""Rocky"" was the original, and it had a purpose). Emilio Estevez has starred in much better movies (e.g., ""The Outsiders"").To this movie's credit, I will say that the more-like-a-circumcision scene was pretty entertaining. This is far from the worst movie ever. But seriously, there are too many movies like this. As it is, Stephen Herek hasn't made much of a name for himself as a director. His only good movies were ""Critters"" and ""Mr. Holland's Opus"". Otherwise, aside from this movie, he's directed stuff like ""Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead"" and ""Life or Something Like It"". Basically, he competes with Michael Bay and Renny Harlin for the position of Worst Director in the World.So my recommendation is to avoid this movie.",The Mighty Ducks
5,jboothmillard,The Mighty Ducks,3,30 August 2011,"I had heard the title a few times before, and I may have occasionally watched the television cartoon series Disney created that was loosely based on this, so I had to see what it was all about, from director Stephen Herek (Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, 101 Dalmatians). Basically young hotshot lawyer Gordon Bombay (The Breakfast Club's Emilio Estevez) is arrested for drink driving, and the court orders him to serve community service by coaching a children's hockey team, not very good in their league, and of course he is not happy. As he gets to know the youngsters though, and gains their like for him as well, he teaches them good skills of how to play and ultimately win a match. They also manage to get a sponsor and don the team name of The Ducks, but while all this is going on Gordon still has flashes from his past where he played hockey himself, watched by now apposing Coach Jack Reilly (Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman's Lane Smith), and he lost. It is coming close to the finals, and he is possible to lose the team due to his sentence having come to an end, and all the young members of The Ducks may be losing some hope for whatever reason. Of course everything comes back together in the end, Gordon watches his team score victory, and the last scene sees him going away to tryout in the minor league, and he promises to return for the next season (this obviously gives way for the sequels). Also starring Joss Ackland as Hans, Heidi Kling as Casey Conway, Joshua Jackson as Charlie Conway, Josef Sommer as Mr. Gerald Ducksworth, Elden Henson as Fulton Reed, Shaun Weiss as Greg Goldberg, Lost's M.C. Gainey as Lewis and Matt Doherty as Lester Averman. I will be completely honest and say that I didn't pay the fullest of attention to this, but even if I had I doubt I would have been entertained all the way through, it seemed pretty dull and rather predictable, it may have the heartwarming and sporty moments, but overall not a great family sports comedy. Adequate!",The Mighty Ducks
6,studioAT,Good family fun,5,9 September 2017,"Emilio Estevez of 'Breakfast Club' fame plays a lawyer forced to coach a ice hockey team as part of community service in this Disney family film.It's a fun film with its heart in the right place, and boasts good performances from Estevez and the youngsters playing the team.It's not without its slow moments, and the love story feels a bit shoehorned in, but other than that this is a decent film.",The Mighty Ducks
7,view_and_review,"""Bad News Bears"" on Ice",6,13 April 2020,"Reluctant coach takes over a laughably bad hockey team. Yeah, that's ""Bad News Bears on Ice.""""The Mighty Ducks"" could've been so much better without the contrived conflict. I know it's hard to distinguish yourself as a David v. Goliath sports movie, but no need to make it full of nauseatingly pointless drama.Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) was a successful lawyer and one-time child hockey star. After a DUI he was sentenced to 500 hours community service which entailed coaching a no-name youth hockey team. His boss, Gerald Ducksworth (Josef Sommer), thought it would help him build character and learn ""fair play.""When he took over the team, they were a mess. They weren't a hockey team; they were just a bunch of kids with ice skates. After some customary bad coaching, Coach Bombay had an epiphany and started being the coach he should've been.Now for the unnecessary drama.Exhibit A.Gordon pointed out to the Pee Wee Hockey league that due to district lines there was a kid, Adam Banks (Vincent LaRusso), on the Hawks who was ineligible to play for the Hawks, so either he could play for the Ducks or not play at all. When the coach of the Hawks, Jack Reilly (Lane Smith), caught up with Gordon in the hallway they had it out. In their exchange Gordon said, ""We're losers; not fit to live,"" in a sarcastic tone to indicate Coach Riley's sentiments. But because some 11-year-old kids were eavesdropping they COMPLETELY misunderstood him and took that info back to the team. The team quit.Exhibit B.When Gordon went back to work to meet up with his boss he was confronted by his boss, Coach Reilly, and Adam Banks' father. Apparently, Mr. Banks (Hal Fort Atkinson III) was a big client of Mr. Duckworth's firm and he wanted to use that as leverage to force Gordon to withdraw his petition (i.e. his complaint that got Adam removed from the Hawks). Mr. Duckworth, in classic rich old man = rich old jerk fashion, told Gordon to withdraw his position or lose his job. How wholly ridiculous and over the top. It's not even like Adam couldn't play, he just couldn't play for the Hawks. This was drama for drama sake.Exhibit C.The Ducks hate Adam, especially Jessie Hall (Brandon Adams). Even when Adam was scoring goals for the Ducks, Jessie couldn't get over his inexplicable disdain for Adam.Exhibit D.And for the coup de gras: the Ducks made the championship game versus the Hawks. Coach Reilly instructed two of his players to injure Adam Banks because that's the kind of low-life b*stard Coach Reilly was. After the kid McGill (Michael Ooms) sent Adam into the goalpost, knocking him out of the game, another kid asked McGill, ""What did you do?""McGill answered in a sinister manner, ""My job.""What!?! Are you serious right now? Unbelievable. I played youth football in the early 90's and even the meanest kids wouldn't have responded like that and in such a deadpan, cold-blooded manner. Was McGill an evil overlord in training? That was what I'd expect from a low-level criminal trying to crack into the big time. Oh! it was ghastly.Take out all the extra padding called drama and this movie would've been better. No, it was never going to be unique, it's like almost every other sports movie. Its only distinguishing characteristic is the sport itself, but it seems they weren't happy with that small difference. I say, don't do more than you have to. KISS: keep it simple stupid and avoid looking like a farce.",The Mighty Ducks
8,anaconda-40658,Skates on Thin Storytelling.,1,24 November 2015,"The Mighty Ducks (1992): Dir: Stephen Herek / Cast: Emilio Estivez, Joss Ackland, Joshua Jackson, Lane Smith, Elden Henson: Another Bad News Bears knockoff with Emilio Estevez training a group of misfits to play hockey. Director Stephen Herek does a fine job with the lifeless material including the familiar production. He previously made the more inventive Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and the dumbfounded Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead. With this film his screenwriter fails to deliver an excellent adventure, but like the babysitter in the other film, this one is totally dead. The screenplay is filled with types. You have the ominous big kid who can hit well but amateur in other areas. You have the kid who needs encouragement and whose mother will end up romancing with the coach she first disliked. Sound familiar? Estivez basically goes through the same tired formula that many others have with results that will surprise no one. Joss Ackland, Joshua Jackson and Lane Smith appear in cardboard supporting roles and everyone of them are pretty much interchangeable. Message regards teamwork but isn't that what all of these films are about? The only evidence of teamwork here is the effort put into making this garbage one of the worst films of the year. One should encourage director Herek to skate on over the studio and demand a better project. Score: 1 / 10",The Mighty Ducks
9,StevePulaski,A Disney movie that gets half the job done,6,17 November 2012,"Never in my life, even in the R-rated movies of Kevin Smith and Tarantino, have I heard the expression ""what the hell?"" been used so often and for such little reasoning. From the children in the pee-wee hockey team, from its headlining stars, to just plain background characters, it seems everyone has that same question on their mind.Well, where the hell do I begin? The Mighty Ducks is an experiment done by Disney that was allegedly aimed to usher in a more tweenish fanbase than their animation studios, by providing a live action experience and a more mature feel. They succeeded in making a spontaneous, somewhat entertaining piece of nostalgia for the current generation of teens, but to be completely honest, this is one of the most vanilla sports movies I've sat through in my day, only elevated to being somewhat passable because of its efficient use of its star, Emilio Estevez (seeing this as a child, this was my introduction to the man who would later be one of my favorite male character actors) and its surprisingly successful array of motivational music, which make the cliché ending satisfying and memorable.The story is paper thin, but works as some minor league, or pee-wee, entertainment. Estevez plays Gordon Bombay, an immensely cocky, successful defense attorney who has never lost a case in his life, but is sentenced to coach a team of young, misfit hockey players after being caught drunk driving. Bombay has had contention with the sport of hockey after he blew a title win in a penalty shot as a child, greatly putting his coach (Lane Smith) to shame.Now, coaching the District Five team, Bombay is unmotivated and careless, until he sees these kids are genial and somewhat good-natured (and the fact that his old coach is still employed at their rival team), leading him to finally put effort into his work. He names the team the ""Ducks,"" after the most noble creature in the wild, who travel in packs and stick by one another.Estevez gives about the most entertaining performance one could bring to the table for this kind of movie. His character is a smart-ass, cut-throat, boisterous know-it-all, who winds up having his heart warmed by a group of helpless kids who don't take that much pride playing for the hockey team until he gets involved.One of the downfalls of the children is that they are carbon-copies of the rambunctious tykes we see in so many movies, and any point at connecting or learning about one of them is especially moot. They are not interesting children, and even in a hundred and three minutes, we do not even get one as our surrogate to learn more about. Not to mention, the film is also about twenty minutes to long, thanks to a needless romantic subplot involving one of the children's mothers. The result is corny and usually unnecessary, but Estevez's chemistry with the mother, Heidi King, is just charming enough to make us somewhat care.As simple, pleasant entertainment, obviously the film's main goal, The Mighty Ducks works just fine as basic and has competence to carry a long runtime. The problem lies in its screenplay, which is flat and unambitious. Even though it's branded with the Disney name, just a few years later, we were welcomed with the brilliant breath of fresh air which was Remember the Titans, so Disney clearly wasn't incapable of delivering the goods in a sports film. The slapstick-reliant humor is goofy, yet it works, Estevez is fitting in his role, and the ending with music dominated by Queen brings a smile even to a hard-headed cynic's face. It's a Disney movie that gets half the job done.Starring: Emilio Estevez, Joss Ackland, Lane Smith, Heidi Kling, Josef Sommer, Joshua Jackson, Elden Henson, and Shaun Weiss. Directed by: Stephen Herek.",The Mighty Ducks
10,Smells_Like_Cheese,A sweet and lovable kid's movie,7,15 November 2006,"Just recently, I saw D2 and D3, my friend unfortunately did not have the first Mighty Ducks movie, so I had to watch those first then rent this one. The second and the third were pretty good movies, but I felt bad, because it felt like you're getting into a group of friends, and you don't know their history, you weren't there? You know that feeling, and as silly as it sounds, that's how I felt watching the sequels without seeing the first one.Gordon is a lawyer who has had a little trouble with the lying in his career, therefore, he must do community service. When he sees a group of young pre-teen troubled youths playing a game of hockey, remembering his childhood love of hockey, he volunteers to become their coach in the Pee-Wee games. He starts off on a rocky relationship since he doesn't like kids, but he grows to love them and they do back learning that there is more to a game than just winning, but it'd be nice since they end up in the championships.I loved The Mighty Ducks, I felt like it was a terrific family film and I'm surprised it wasn't played in my childhood since I was seven years old when it came out, but you know the saying, better late then never, right? I would highly recommend this up lifting story for any family!7/10",The Mighty Ducks
11,John6Daniels,Quack,10,21 March 2021,Classic 90s Gold. Quack. I always admired the might ducks name and logo.This product was about a coach forced to coach peewee hockey and turns a bag of flour into a cake. Quack.The 90s feel was so awesome. Its so cool to relive this classic. Each child actor does a great job in this Gold. Quack. The story is about enduring the odds and becoming champions. At the same time its about not dwelling on the past just because you missed. QuackI was Surprised to realize Foggy from Daredevil was the big slap shot kid. Quack Its such a small world.Overall a great movie for 90s children and for sports fans.Quack What can be learned? Winning could be subject sometimes.Verdict: Quack Quack.,The Mighty Ducks
12,zkonedog,"Is To Hockey What ""Little Big League"" Is To Baseball",7,2 March 2017,"Though perhaps unknown to the warm-weather climates of the nation, youth hockey (and even hockey in general) is a big, big real. ""Mighty Ducks"" taps into that fan base with a fun little movie set in Minnesota that captures the fun, drama, and emotion of the experience.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez), a corrupt lawyer who his forced into community in the form of coaching Minneapolis, MN youth hockey (an area in which he had some childhood experience). While at first, Bombay is hesitant to give even a modicum of effort towards the cause, he gains inspiration (whether positive or negative) from old-time mentor Hans (Joss Ackland), former coach Jack Reilly (Lane Smith), and bright-eyed youngster Charlie Conway (Joshua Jackson).This is a pretty straightforward kids flick. It has the requisite goofy humor, sometimes cringe- worthy dialogue, and a heavy amount of rah-rah drama. Even if your kids aren't necessarily into hockey, they will like this type of movie.The reason why this movie transcends kiddie fare, though, is because it captures the essence of hockey. It treats the sport with a great deal of respect and reverence, which taps into the nostalgia of adults watching. Just like how ""Little Big League"" just ""gets"" baseball humor, ""Mighty Ducks"" does the exact same thing as hockey.Basically, you can't go wrong with this on family movie night. It has enough of everything to not bore any member of the family tears. In fact, it may (depending on your interest in sports/hockey) become a sort of cult classic in your own family.",The Mighty Ducks

14,mattkratz,good formula movie,8,23 April 2017,"You know this movie's formula and can figure out how it's going to turn out, but it's still a good movie and good family fare. Emilio Estevez plays a hotshot lawyer who is haunted by the time when he was a kid when he missed a penalty shot during a hockey tournament and they lost the game, ""letting down"" the demanding coach. He is now a lawyer who reverts to ""dishonest"" means to do whatever it takes to win a case. When he gets busted for DWI, he has to do community service and coach a ragtag kids hockey team. He initially uses the same techniques while coaching but eventually transforms them into champions. You knew that was going to happen, didn't you?Estevez's coach and supervisor at work will remind you of each other. I liked the differences between the speeches Estevez and his coach give on the penalty shots. I also think this was a good family movie;it offers no surprises but is still a good movie with good ""lesson"" and hockey scenes.*** out of ****",The Mighty Ducks
15,r96sk,I enjoyed it,8,24 September 2020,"Very good.'The Mighty Ducks' is a film that I've heard about for a long, long time but this was my first time watching. I enjoyed it, in short. Satisfying sports story, a solid message, decent humour and a serviceable cast.Emilio Estevez is fine in the role of Gordon, he's definitely the best actor on display here. The numerous child actors are all alright, Shaun Weiss (Goldberg) is the one who stands out in my memory most.A nice little film about a local, youth ice hockey team, one for the family.",The Mighty Ducks
16,lukem-52760,A Really Nice 90's-Nostalgic Family Film With Heart,7,27 October 2021,"I've always been a fan of Emilio Estevez for as long as i can remember because of films such as Stakeout & Another Stakeout & Maximum Overdrive & Freejack & Young Guns & Loaded Weapon 1 among others as these were films i had on video from young & then as i got older i discovered Emilio Estevez's greatest movie= JUDGMENT NIGHT (1993) & that cemented him as one of my favourite actors but i had never fully seen his most beloved movies, The Mighty Ducks.I grew up in the 90's so i knew all about the ""Ducks"" films & how popular they were & the animated series & my friend even had a ""D3"" poster on his bedroom wall so i grew up around that Awesome time of the early 90's but i never got around to actually seen any of the Ducks films fully. I had caught bits of the first film on t.v like on a Sunday afternoon or something but never watched a full Ducks film until now in 2021!!! I'm very late to the game.Estevez is always enjoyable & is great heartfelt fun as Gordon Bombay (Which i believe is his most loved character of his Career) as Estevez has that nice-guy & easy going appeal to his characters & Gordon is pretty much a perfect role for Estevez when he's on that charming comic form. Estevez is a very underrated actor in my opinion & is one we all grew up loving from the 80's (The Breakfast Club, Stakeout) & into the early 90's (Young Guns 2, Judgment Night, Mighty Ducks Trilogy) & his films are some of the Classic's we will always cherish from those times & Estevez's youthful boyish face is cemented into our Nostalgic brains. Anyway i love Estevez & i really enjoyed the uplifting & comforting family favourite ""The Mighty Ducks are the Champions"" & can see why it's so loved still today. Estevez is great here in his natural nice way & the bunch of kids are good fun & there's a whole lot of heart in the story.The underdogs come up fighting when Gordon Bombay steps in to train a team of menacing trickster kids who had no one to believe in them until Coach Bombay. There's drama here too with Bombay's own troubled childhood of losing his teams big game but more devastating was the loss of his father around the same time so Gordon is full of sadness that has never left him & that's why when we meet him he's a hard & cold lawyer who lives for his work & has no time for family until he breaks the law with a drinking driving mistake & has to do community service by teaching a young kids Ice hockey team in his home town where he grew up & of course he learns alot about himself on this journey.This is a Disney family film so it's obviously childish & silly at times but its also actually very grown up in parts & often very touching at times & it's all hell down by Estevez's sensitive performance.A lovely film.",The Mighty Ducks
17,Agent10,A great film for all to watch,7,24 June 2002,"One of the great kid movie-sports-films of all time, this movie always has a special place in my heart when it comes to losers turning into winners. Sure, some of the action proved to be a little sappy, but it was all in good fun. Emilio Estevez provided a rather believable performance as a snooty lawyer turned-peewee hockey coach. Virtually all of the characters were great in this film, even the annoying Goldberg. A good film to say the least, one that shouldn't have spawned sequels.",The Mighty Ducks
18,questl-18592,Quack,4,30 January 2021,"When I was a wee lad, I loved this film. Hockey was tremendously popular in my area and we eventually moved to somewhere that was less interested in it and The Mighty Ducks were like my lifeline. Nostalgia didn't save this one on rewatching though because now... Yikes. This is a wildly generic sports drama movie with some doses of utter ludicrousness tossed in for good measure. The team is called the Ducks and one of the bad guys is named Ducksworth? Come on! That's just lazy. Beyond that though, this is some of the worst hockey I've ever seen. None of this makes a lick of sense, it's all super clunky and positions are way off... Yeah, it's just not great. Couple that with a fairly mediocre storyline and I found myself bored and often flirting with annoyance as I watched.So, if you, like me, had good memories of this from your childhood then let those stay memories. This doesn't hold up at all and was so disheartening to watch now. Skip this, go watch Miracle instead if you need some good hockey action.",The Mighty Ducks
19,vertigo_14,The Bad News Bears on ice. (minor spoilers),5,13 March 2006,"Despite the tremendously clichéd plot--that of an aging fallen athletic hero who loses faith in himself and disinterest in the sport until he has the opportunity to turn a misfit team into a victorious one with hard work and much-needed nurturing--the Mighty Ducks is probably for those youngsters of the early 1990s what films like the Karate Kid were to those youngsters of the mid-80s. One of the classics, a guilty pleasure we secretly don't switch off when channel surfing on lazy weekend afternoons. One that marked early careers or more well-known stars today (with the most obvious being a prepubescent Joshua Jackson). For hockey fans alone, it may be enjoyable, despite hockey movies never being very inventive in the tell of the tale (see Youngblood and Miracle for other examples of the same old, same old). But nonetheless, it is still a valued time capsule and a feel good movie that yes, cheesy and clichéd and dated (no one really does much roller-blading anymore--see the practice scenes, can still be enjoyed.",The Mighty Ducks

It is the not-so-original story about a coach and his team. The team happens to be a group of annoying children who slide around the hockey rink and who learn what it is like to be the underdog and then succeed through the help of their heroic coach. I found this to be an annoying (the children got on my nerves) film which lacked anything and everything possible to qualify as a decent film.

This is a wonderful movie for the family, and even more wonderful if you're into sports such as Ice Hockey. It's a Disney movie. This is for Ice Hockey fans! The story was compelling, and that's what I liked most about The Mighty Ducks. You could learn a thing or two by watching this movie. It's a movie that can get you to like the sport: Ice Hockey. Basically, a new team is formed to compete in a tournament called ""The Mighty Ducks"". Their ultimate goal is to come out as champions! Can they do it? Can they become victorious? You need to watch it to find out. It will be worth your time. I like the title for this movie, and I also like how they call their team as ""The Mighty Ducks"" - it's such a cool team name. I was always in support for ""The Mighty Ducks"" right the way throughout. It's a movie which gets you, the viewer, to support the 'Ducks' in their journey of becoming champions. What I liked most about the movie was the story itself. It was a wonderful story. A nice movie for the entire family to see. The kids will like it. It's a movie for them particularly. Let's not forget many of the sequels which followed - The Mighty Ducks 2 and The Mighty Ducks 3. You should see it! The movie comes in three parts.

Of course, the Anaheim Ducks entered the NHL in 1993, founded by the Walt Disney Company and based on the fictional Ducks.The story is familiar after nearly 30 years: Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) is a cocky lawyer who prides himself on his undefeated run of cases. As established in an opening credits flashback, Bombay is haunted by blowing the State Title win for the Hawks, much to the disappointment of the hardline Coach Reilly (Lane Smith). After being pinged for reckless driving, Bombay is forced to do community service, which involves coaching District Five, the lovable - but hopeless - band of Pee Wee Ice Hockey players.Of course, it wouldn't be a sports movie without Bombay and the rebranded Ducks facing the Hawks, and the still hardline Coach Reilly, in the championship game.What makes this movie tick is the kids: while Les Averman's (Matt Doherty) constant quips get annoying, the rest of the kids are funny. While the kids are played for comedic value, the hockey action itself is taken seriously; even when the old District Five team struggle, they still try their best, which is a great lesson for younger viewers.Two of the biggest graduates of this movie are Josh Jackson (famous for ""Dawson's Creek"" and being a late 90s/early 2000s heartthrob) and Elden Henson (who played Foggy Nelson in Netflix's ""Daredevil"" series).",The Mighty Ducks
29,Slarkshark,Much More Than a Never-Was,8,29 March 2021,"The movie that literally created a National Hockey League team. If that's not impressive I don't know what is.I played competative hockey for a long time, and I'm still an avid fan of the game. I grew up with this movie. My teammates and I watched it many times (along with Don Cherry's Rock'em Sock'em), and we loved it. Coach Bombay is the man.I watched the pilot for the new Mighty Ducks series, and had to revisit the original afterwards for old times sake. It did not disappoint. And, I can still remember most of the lines.As for the actual hockey scenes... well let me just say they may not be the most accurate in how the game is played, but it's all part of the fun.Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack!",The Mighty Ducks
30,ShortCuteBlonde,it was alright,6,17 August 2002,"this movie wasnt what i would call great but it was ok, it was kind of cheesy and corny but it was a cute movie for little kids, i advise all you too see it, specially if you have kids that are 8-11 its overall a cute movie, even for older kids and adults",The Mighty Ducks
31,Caleb_Everett,Mighty indeed,9,17 January 2019,"Imagine living in a world where the mistakes you made in pee wee hockey haunt you even in adulthood. That's the reality that Gordon Bombay lives in every single day. This Disney Classic is one of my all time favorites, granted watching it now as I'm older really makes you realize how ridiculous the story is and how the characters in the tale make everything a bigger deal than it needs to be. Can you imagine a lawyer losing his job because he refuses to withdraw a complaint to the pee wee hockey league! The movie does have a great story, no matter how ridiculous it might seem. I think it's a definite must-watch for any young athlete.",The Mighty Ducks

33,blackwidowis7cool,The best of the trilogy,10,25 July 2019,"Gordan Bombay (Emilio Estivez - I hope I'm spelling that correctly) is a hotshot lawyer who is cocky and full of himself. After repeated violations of the law, he is arrested and put on community service - coaching District Five, a hockey team full of rather undisciplined kids. How can he cope with the team and going up against his old coach and nemesis, Jack Reilly? Can he train and teach the kids, win the game, and get the girl?
You can tell how it ends. It's one of those predictable, feel-good movies - but a really good one! It can be silly and somewhat painful at times, but you still love it. The acting is alright, but nothing much to speak of. The romantic subplot is a nice touch.
A great family-friendly comedy that you and your kids will love to watch several times.",The Mighty Ducks
34,Watcher-37,Thoroughly enjoyable fare,10,25 August 1999,"I love movies that have sports themes to them, so it normally takes a lot for me to hate one. Thankfully I loved this film. The whole underdog rising up, the coach's redemption, and the big game finale wasn't as hokey as you might expect it to be. Emilio Estevez is a very winning actor in this film, maybe he should stick to light comedy. The kids in the cast are extremely comfortable in front of the camera and mesh with each other well. All in all a wonderful film by Disney, even if it did give the company the impression that they knew so much about hockey that they went out and bought a team.",The Mighty Ducks

37,toddrandall68,"If this crap interested you, you are hopeless",1,14 December 2005,"I noticed that there were only a few comments on this film. Is that because it completely sucked? This movie is not only bad, it is a bad rip off of another film (Bad News Bears). Was there ever a MLB team called the Bad News Bears? That is the only difference I could find between the two. Oh, and except that Emilio Estevez is a waste while Matthau is one of the best. I have commented on this movie before so I wont go over the similarities again. Except one, did anyone notice that forfeited game similarity? Forfeited game! That is so lame I cant believe it! If anyone saw that and wasn't furious I feel sorry for you. If I would have seen this in the theater, I would have walked out and busted up the place. However, I saw this with my buddies during a cookout, and if I wasn't more concerned with maintaining my composure, I would have smacked each and everyone of them while they were laughing at this nonsense.",The Mighty Ducks

Some continuity issues here and there, but hey, who's counting?",The Mighty Ducks
39,yorktown_hawk,One of my fav kids movies.,9,6 August 2020,"I'm a bit young to have seen Bad News Bears so I can't compare.
It's your typical kids movie about rags to riches with the serious drama right in the middle that almost derails the glory. In the end, they overcome the drama and win it all.
The casting was good and the characters were all entertaining if you're a kid.It's still a good movie to put on if you're after some childhood nostalgia.",The Mighty Ducks
40,dpoll390,Good times,9,15 July 2005,"***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***The Mighty Ducks is one of my favorite sports movies by far. This movie reminds me of when I played in a Pee Wee hockey league and my team sucked. It was so much fun, and it was portrayed very well in this movie. The ending, even thought its a Disney movie, was not too corny. It was a good, happy ending to the movie, not overdone in any way.The story was good, but I'm not going to spoil it for anyone. Basically its about a horrible hockey team that needs a coach. The coach is a mean, up-tight lawyer who is forced to do community service. Together they become champions.Emelio Estevez does a great job as coach Gordon Bombay and really adds more of an adult humor to the cast of misfit kids that bring funny, but immature humor to the movie.Disney does good. 9/10",The Mighty Ducks
41,JBingeWatcher,A heartwarming classic,6,25 February 2021,A charming film about a young man who has to turn a group of ice hockey children into a real team.

43,PopRox9139,Like a stroll down memory lane.,10,23 March 2003,"I remember my cousins and I used to always watch these movies when I was a kid. I loved how these bad-playing, poor attitude-having kids could always be inspired to become champions, no matter how tough the odds and no matter how many times movies like this were remade with soccer, football, baseball, and dogs. Even though I've seen it a million times, I still get chills when the team works as a team and goes out to try their hardest. It's enough to make me, one of the least sporty people alive, want to join a sporting team. Another highlight, for me at least, were the guys. I always had at least one guy in the movie who I had a crush on and kept my undivided attention on. Who would've known back then that young Charlie (Joshua Jackson) would grow up to use big words and pretentious speeches on Dawson's Creek? Out of all those inspirational sports-are-good-for-kids movies, this was and always will be my favorite because it is the first one I can remember and the first I've ever seen. 1...2...3...Quack!

45,playmkr278,IMDb should research sports plots,8,1 January 2006,"I loved The Might Ducks. It helps that I play ice hockey and am an avid fan when I'm not playing. IMDb may want to do some research for this movie's plot. Gordon Bombay misses a penalty shot not a shootout. Those are two separate events that simply involve the same type of play.Otherwise this movie does contain very juvenile humor so if you are looking for high brow go somewhere else. I really liked when Gordon tells Charlie that ""you may make it you may not"" before Charlie takes his penalty shot. It's of course very obvious ending with Conway getting the penalty shot and winning it all. A more realistic ending would have been Charlie missing the shot too but then somehow because of their attitude they don't let it get them down and they win it in overtime.Oh well though. It was a really great movie and when members critique these movies they should always check the date on the movie because technology has grown in ""leaps and bounds"" over the last few years.",The Mighty Ducks
46,uptownrn,The King of Kiddie Comedy,7,11 June 2006,"Made in a time when comedies about kids and sports were probably among the most popular kinds of movies, The Mighty Ducks is the undisputed best of any of these. (Other favorites of mine include The Sandlot and Little Giants.) The plot isn't complicated, as many have said, Gordon Bombay is an overworked lawyer who gets a DUI charge and is given community service, coaching a kids hockey team of misfits. The difficulty in this is Gordon played hockey himself as a kid, and blew a championship game. Without giving too much away, Gordon teaches the kids hockey, and they teach him to not take life too seriously.What makes this movie special is really the portrayal of the kids. Sure they sort of fall in to stereotypes, the goofy fat kid, the short but tough kid, the misunderstood ""bad"" kid, the lovable and sweet underdog (Charlie Conway, played by Joshua Jackson, pre Pacy, although in the Ducks sequels you see shades of that character coming out!) but these characters feel real, and are very funny. I don't know if younger kids still watch this movie but if you ask any teenagers who Goldberg is you'll get a laugh and some fun reminiscing. Not to mention they often know the correct moments for quacking (not when getting yelled at by your principal!) All in all definitely worth watching, if only for a trip down memory lane!",The Mighty Ducks
47,andrew-repko,"Don't Hire Ducksworth, Saver & Gross Law Firm",10,24 October 2017,"The Mighty Ducks is an incredible movie, check that, f'n legendary. They named a Pro Hockey Team (NHL or National Hockey League) after the team from the movie. In my eyes this movie is a 10 out of 10. But I do question the reliability of the law firm Gordon Bombay worked at, Ducksworth, Saver & Gross. First off, the guy who runs the Law firm's name is Mr. Ducksworth, seems slimy. Secondly, Gordon Bombay is a drunk idiot who gets a DUI, for what I believe is the 3rd time, and still somehow has a job. Instead of firing him, they suspend him and force him to coach an awful pee-wee hockey team. YOU ARE A LAW FIRM, WHY WOULD YOU NOT JUST FIRE HIM, makes you question if they know any real laws at all. Anyway, Gordo takes over just a garbage team and slowly turns them around with some great flopping techniques ""take the fall, act hurt, get indignant"" Rolls off the tongue. So Gordo, in an attempt to kiss up to his moronic boss, M. Ducksworth, he re-names District-5 as The Mighty Ducks. Cute at first, but troublesome in the long run. So, this stupid Law firm, then decides to fire Gordon, after he uses he's lawyerness (which he should be commended for) to find out the Leagues best player Adam Banks or Banksy, was playing for the wrong team. The awful Hawks, and should be playing for the M. Ducks. Banksy's dad and the vindictive 60 year old pee-wee hockey coach convince Ducksworth to fire Gord, if he doesn't allow Banksy to play for the Hawks. Gordy obvious tells them to Quack off and loses his Job. So, in-conclusion, DUI = Slap on the Wrist, follow the rules and guidelines of Pee-wee hockey and act with integrity, you get fired. Also, Gordon is somewhere around 27 years old and he's already a top Lawyer in the firm, so he's got to be awesome. But sure, fire him b/c a pee-wee hockey team won't have the best player. I'd hire any other law firm, one that isn't swayed by POLITICS!One plot hole I question. Gordon Bombay going off to play minor league hockey at the end of the movie? That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. According to Hans, he stopped playing hockey at 9 y/o after he cost the Hawks a championship (the only one they lost in a 30 year period, Coach Jack Reilly wishes they would take down that 2nd place banner, and you know what he has a point!) So, no hockey from 9 to 27? I don't care how much natural talent you have, if you don't play hockey during that time period, you aren't going to be good enough to try out for the minor leagues. Coach Reilly kind of rules, dude is like 60 years old, and to my knowledge, his full time Job is to be a pee-wee coach of the Hawks. He has no problem holding grudges for an insanely stupid amount of time. When he first sees Gordy after 18 years, he makes it a point to indirectly call him a huge failure. All b/c he missed a penalty shot goal, shortly after the 9 y/o lost his father. That's some Bill Belichick level stuff. You have to question the refs during the games, they let the Hawks get away with some of the craziest things, those kids should be locked up for the crimes they committed on the ice. When the Ducks were just D-5, no ref should have allowed them on the ice without proper equipment. Stupid Goldberg had tape instead of pads, yep, tape! That is insane, but Goldberg is from Philly and likes the Flyers so that rules. Gerald Gardner, age 11 141 pounds, was wearing a football helmet, like get a grip refs! Terry & Jessie's Dad didn't give up his overtime for this!Couple kewl surprises in this movie. One, Pete from pete and pete is in the movie, nice add. Two, in the end credits, they play an absolute JAM, Winning it All by The Outfield, go listen to it. A+ song. And Lastly, Go Flyers.",The Mighty Ducks

49,sevencrazydeflimproaches,"A really good movie, best of the trilogy",9,4 May 2008,"I really like this movie out of the three Ducks movies because to me, this is the only one that feels like a genuine movie to me. A movie that was made from the heart. The reasons for it? There are two of them that stick out to me.Gordon Bombay goes through one hell of a transformation. He goes from a drunk lawyer to reconnecting with his old love and facing a demon that has haunted him up to now. Even the introduction scene carries an ominous feeling. The goalie facing the young Bombay looks more like a menacing monster; as well as it should be since it represents a horrible memory for the man. I remember being scared of that scene as a child, just cause the goalie looked so scary.His character's transformation over the movie is the heart of this film. It's a protagonist who has a REAL arc - beginning, middle, and end. It's all carried out with such poignancy as well. Emilio Estevez does great acting.The child actors do a good job. I mean, they're KIDS, and this is a kid movie...but they pull it off nicely. The kids who play Charlie, Fulton, Jesse, and Banks especially. They make you take their characters seriously, which is different from a normal kids movie.The kiddy parts don't make me cringe, but make me smile. I guess because it's not overdone.Sorry to say, but the other two movies to me relied too much on either hockey action or gimmicks (although I DID like D3's grittier hockey action and more serious story with Charlie). They didn't have the heartfelt story that this one did. It's all balanced out to entertain the little kids, but Gordon Bombay's arc is one for the adults.I also miss the kids that would end up not being in the future movies. In D3, when Gordon says that the Ducks were unchanged since the beginning, I cringed. I guess I'm the type to cling to sentimental values like that.This was the best movie out of the trilogy to me. That's because it felt like a REAL movie.",The Mighty Ducks

51,garryama,Bombay did his job. Goldberg is off one,10,9 August 2018,"In light of recent events concerning a star of this movie I felt compelled to write my second review of this movie. I want to start off by saying I spend a lot of time reading movie reviews and I cannot understand the negativity that comes along with this movie. I must have not watched the same movie as the 1 and 2 star reviewers because from what I saw this movie deserves more than a 10/10 star review. The storyline, acting, cinematic effects and dynamic between the cast is bar none. The 1 and 2 star reviewers cannot honestly tell me they weren't impressed by Gordon Bombay's abilities to take a helpless group of kids that had no chance of going anywhere in life let alone hockey and making them champions. The mighty ducks is a truly inspiring story and one that has been giving hope to kids and adults alike for generations. Unfortunately for one duck the pressure and spotlight that comes with such great success has caused some turmoil in his life, however I think it's important to understand that Goldberg's actions in no way reflect upon the team nor should they diminish the actions of Coach Bombay who took on the heroic task of turning a bunch of kids from Minnesota to world renown legends. At the end of the day, regardless of arrests and negative reviews, ""I'm proud to be a Duck, and I'd be proud to fly with any one of you.""",The Mighty Ducks

Emilio Estevez is the man and use to play hockey when he was younger. When Gordon Bombay was a kid he use to skate and play hockey. he joined the Hawks ice hockey team. it all came down to him in the end in a penalty shot, he missed the shot causing the hawks to loose the game.Gordon Bombay was successful lawyer then went to teaching hockey. these kids were not ready. he takes a young group of kids Charlie and Goldberg the lovable goalie. and their other Buddy's. coach Bombay wasn't to happy with there performance for the last few games they lost a lot and tried to get the team to take dives to get penalties. The parents of the children who he teaches aren't happy with coach Bombay's performance.In the end its the Hawks Vs the Ducks with Gordon Bombay's original coach Lane Smith (I) he also was in the movie son in law with Paulie shore. the game came down to Charlie the Captian. there was a pentialy shot for a Hawk player tripping Charlie on a breakaway. It was all down to Charlie and the goalie one on one mono a mono. Charlies famous move is the triple deek you better believe Charlie use this movie to score the winning goal for the ducks.
