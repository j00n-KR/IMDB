0,Leofwine_draca,Gruelling cabin-in-the-woods horror,7,23 April 2012,"Controversial, much lauded and horrific to watch, ANTICHRIST is Lars von Trier's showpiece film. It tells the tale of an unhappy marriage that breaks down due to grief, and the extremes that follow. It's a film that plays out as a two-hander for the most part, with Dafoe and Gainsbourg acting it up in a remote woodland cabin and taking out their rage and anger upon each other.The film's simple storyline allows von Trier to concentrate on the things that interest him most. His intelligent, thoughtful script goes deep into the psyche of his characters, exploring the ways in which therapy can – and in some ways, cannot – help a parent to get over the loss of their child. The first half of the film is packed with foreboding that gives way to visceral horror in the second half.Everything you've heard about this film's explicit nature is true; nothing much makes me squeamish anymore, but ANTICHRIST did. I can't stand sexual violence in films and von Trier incorporates it to chilling, disturbing effect, made all the more powerful due to its brief nature. In many ways, the second half of this film becomes HOSTEL in the woods, except it's all the more frightening because violence comes from a loved one rather than a stock villain.Dafoe and Gainsbourg are both very good; they couldn't not be, seeing as what von Trier asks of them. Dafoe plays the more sympathetic role and Gainsbourg's character is a little shrill on occasion, but neither of them disappoint. Von Trier directs in classic art-house style with beautiful shots interspersed with grotesque imagery and true left-of-field interludes.It's certainly not a film for the faint of heart or an experience I would choose to put myself through again, but I think that ANTICHRIST is a great example of a director following his vision without compromise.",Antichrist
1,SnoopyStyle,prefer less artsy and more horror,6,20 August 2016,"A couple (Willem Dafoe, Charlotte Gainsbourg) is having sex while their child Nic climbs out of a bedroom window falling to his death. She is devastated and hospitalized. He takes her to a remote cabin to recover. She becomes more and more disturbed as it devolves into a chaotic horror.Lars von Trier has taken a personal horror and added psycho-sexual artsy ideas. It's definitely different and completely original. Some of it is for shock value. I would prefer less artsy moves and concentrate on the horror. He does not necessarily have a grasp on the standard horror moves but his strange concepts are quite compelling as well as off-putting. They are challenging. It would be helpful to explain it more but that's the artsy part. This is an interesting experimental horror.",Antichrist
2,claudio_carvalho,"Provocative, Challenging and Open to Interpretations",8,3 November 2009,"Prologue: While having sex, a couple (Willem Dafoe & Charlotte Gainsbourg) does not pay attention to their son Nick that wakes up, opens the window and falls on the sidewalk.Chapter 1- Grief: The mother becomes extremely depressed in her grief and her therapist husband disagrees with the treatment of Dr. Wayne with excessive use of drugs and medicines. He decides to bring her home and he begins her therapy. Later she is dominated by anxiety.Chapter 2 - Pain (Chaos Reigns): He forces his wife to face her fears and she discloses that her greatest fear is the place in the woods called Eden, where she spent the last vacation alone with Nick. He explains that he left her alone since she wanted to write her thesis. For his surprise, she tells him that she had given up writing. They travel to Eden and she tells that nature is Satan's church and gives signs of insanity.Chapter 3 – Despair (Gynocide): He finds her research in the attic with her notes and sees symptoms of insanity. When he discusses the subject with her, he realizes that she was influenced by the literature and misunderstanding the reason why many women have been sacrificed along history. Further, he discovers through photos and the autopsy report that she was torturing Nick forcing him to use the wrong shoes on his feet. However, she unexpectedly attacks him and pins a millstone in his leg. Chapter 4 – The Three Beggars: He escapes from her crawling in the wood, but she captures him again using a shovel and brings him home. Then she mutilates herself severing her clitoris. He finally gets rid of the millstone, strangles his wife and burns her body.Epilogue: He uses a crutch to leave Eden.After watching ""Antichrist"" with my daughter, we decided to seek clarifications in IMDb, but unfortunately I did not find any satisfactory explanation for the points that I have not understood. Therefore, this provocative and challenging movie is open to interpretations and here is my reading. The couple is certainly in love having sex until their son dies. The mother is an unstable woman that is influenced by wrong interpretation of the literature for her thesis believing that women are evil. She had tortured her son in one of her many moments of insanity, but her husband is not aware of that. In her madness, she blames her pleasure for the death of her son, reason why she severs her source of pleasure (i.e., her clitoris). Lars von Trier uses biblical metaphors but I have the following questions: (1) Why is the title of this movie ""Antichrist""? (2) Are those corpses in the wood hallucination of the woman? (3) What is the meaning of the faceless women in the epilogue?Despite the questions above, ""Antichrist"" is a visually stunning and stylish bleak cult-movie about fear, madness and paranoia, with anguishing and tense atmosphere and having magnificent performances of Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg. Fans of Lars von Trier will certainly appreciate this work of art but I would not recommend this movie to viewers that do not like challenging movies with many gray areas open to discussion. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Antichrist
3,kosmasp,Slow and painful,7,29 September 2009,"The movie begins in slow motion ... and more than half the movie after that, will feel the same way, even if it's not. In other words, the first half of the movie, does take it's time. Slow moving would be an understatement of the biggest kind. That shouldn't surprise you then ... what surprised me though, was the fact, how explicit the movie was!Just a heads up on that too then. While I felt the first part of the movie was a bit dragging, in the end it gets insane (pun intended). Not every movie can say, that it is irritating and leave you with mixed feelings. And even those who do that, are not necessarily good movies. Rating this movie (and others similar to the feeling they leave you) is pretty hard. Just prepare yourself for something completely different and you will get something out of the movie ...",Antichrist
4,classicsoncall,"""...what the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve.""",4,14 March 2020,"So this is the third Lars von Trier film I've seen following 2000's ""Dancer in the Dark"" and 2003's ""Dogville"". Both pictures are pretty dense but ultimately have a story to tell and are quite compelling given the chance. ""Antichrist"" on the other hand, comes across as nothing less than sick, perverse and depraved, and those are some of the better adjectives I could find for it. It starts out well enough, focusing on a troubled couple who lose their young child in a home accident that could have been prevented, and it bothered me that 'She' (Charlotte Gainsbourg), in a thoughtful moment stated to 'He' (Willem Dafoe), that she should have warned him about Nic's (Storm Acheche Sahlstrøm) ability to climb out of the crib on his own. If so, then why leave the apartment window open as a harbinger of potential disaster? Later on in a bit of a flashback scene, there's even a hint that She might have watched complacently as Nic made his way to the window during a love making session with He, and did nothing to stop him. You would have to watch the film again to catch that nuance.There's apparently a lot of symbolism in the picture, but I couldn't decipher any of it. A battered fox attempting to give birth, a deer under similar circumstances running in the woods, and a raucous crow all make their appearances from time to time, evoking some sort of primal urgency to get back to nature. I was intrigued by the use of subliminal suggestion during She's scenes running through the forest, along with that 'melting into the green' to overcome her grief over the loss of a child.But where it all comes crashing down for me was in the third chapter titled 'Despair'. So much of it didn't pass the credibility test for this viewer, bordering on the excess violence of all those slash and gore flicks that have found a certain resonance for modern day viewers. The idea that He wouldn't wake up from having his leg drilled into was totally unconvincing, and forget about hobbling his way around the woods with that thirty pound cement wheel attached; the pain would have rendered anyone else unconscious. Under the circumstances, I couldn't blame Dafoe's character for choking out his wife, but gosh, it was all just too sick to comprehend. Von Trier earns no points from me for being flagrantly voyeuristic.As for my summary line, it was spoken by He while applying a therapeutic technique to his wife. I came across it in a book once dealing with positive mental attitude, and was surprised to hear it quoted virtually verbatim. It's attributable to self help author Napoleon Hill, who actually stated it as - ""Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve."" That was the only positive experience I was able to take away from the picture.",Antichrist
5,gavin6942,"Either Very Deep Or Very Pretentious, And Which Is It?",7,27 October 2014,"A grieving couple retreat to their cabin in the woods, hoping to repair their broken hearts and troubled marriage. But nature takes its course and things go from bad to worse.To get into the right mood before filming started, Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg were shown Andrei Tarkovsky's ""The Mirror"" (1975). As the film is dedicated to the memory of Tarkovsky, this is of no small significance, and to fully understand ""Antichrist"" it might not hurt to first see ""The Mirror"".Von Trier said of this film, ""If God created the world, then he really was behind this whole thing about how different species are killing each other and taking advantage of each other."" Thus he has a fox telling us ""chaos reigns"" and has a lead character explain that ""nature is Satan's church"" before further explaining that women, unlike men, are driven by nature, thus making them in some way evil. We should not take this too literally, as von Trier is not the misogynist some want to make him out to be. But it is an interesting logic all the same.Interestingly, the film found a champion in John Waters, who said, ""If Ingmar Bergman had committed suicide, gone to hell, and come back to earth to direct an exploitation/art film for drive-ins, this is the movie he would have made."" While most critics were quite positive, there are few honors as great as getting Waters; endorsement.",Antichrist
6,jboothmillard,Antichrist,6,9 November 2013,"I heard the title of this film, I knew it was a scary movie, and when it was shown on television there was a lot of warning about it being strictly for adults, because of its controversial material, I would expect nothing less from director Lars Von Trier (The Kingdom, Breaking the Waves, The Idiots, Dancer in the Dark, Dogville). Basically while having sexual intercourse in another room, a couple, called He (Willem Dafoe) and She (Charlotte Gainsbourg) lose their child Nick (Storm Acheche Sahlstrøm) are he falls out of a window to his death. Grieving She is spends some time in hospital, in and out of consciousness, and returning home taking very antidepressant drugs He, her husband and a psychotherapist, tries to help her overcome fears she has developed since the tragedy, and of course elements of the past. To do this He takes her to the cabin in the woods called Eden where She spent time with Nick in summer, She is hesitant of the footbridge before arriving, and the environment surrounding them is sinister as well, with acorns falling onto the roof, seeing dead fawns stuck halfway in a deer's womb, swelling skin from ticks, and a self-disembowelling fox talking. He is angry with her seeing critical sketches and failing to help her significantly, they do have sex and She wants him to her during, she flees into the woods and masturbates under a large tree, and he follows and they have intercourse there, but then a revelation comes that makes her go insane. She finds out her son had deformed feet, and for some reason She accuses the husband that he was planning to leave her, and she pins him down and cruses his testicles with a block of wood, and masturbates him to ejaculate blood, and stop him leaving she drills a hole through his leg and through the wound bolts a heavy grindstone, tossing the wrench away. Waking up alone He drags himself out, he hides in a foxhole hearing her screaming for him, a crow inside the hole starts cawing, he tries to kill it beating, but it doesn't die, She fails to drag him out of his hiding place, so She grabs the shovel and inflicts more pain partially burying him alive in soil. Hours pass and she weeps profusely and apologises to him, unable to find the wrench She drags him back to the cabin, He asks her if she wanted to kill him, She just says ""not yet"", it is clear she is still unstable when while masturbating she takes a pair of scissors and severs her clitoris, screaming in torture. After a witchcraft summoned hailstorm, a visit from the crow, the deer and the fox, He finds the cawing from beneath the floorboards so breaks through he frees the bird, and finds the wrench, She comes in and stabs him in the back with the scissors, He is still able to take off the grindstone, She stops fighting him looking into his eyes, but He strangles her to death and burns her body, before He is able to leave hundreds of women with blurred faces come towards him. Dafoe as the tentative therapist husband and Gainsbourg as the mentally unhinged wife, both unnamed characters, give really good performances, the story you are just about able to follow, there are some strange bizarre random events going on, but this obviously adds to the psychologically surreal feel, but it may be hard to handle the bloody scenes, especially the penis torture and female genital mutilation, not one for everyone, but a fascinating grisly horror drama. Good!",Antichrist
7,BA_Harrison,Lars and the Real Messed-up Girl.,4,13 March 2011,"I've always steered clear of Lars Von Trier's movies for fear of being bored rigid by an onslaught of pretentious, artsy-fartsy garbage, but I relented with Antichrist because I had heard it was an extremely harrowing experience full of very controversial and extremely unsettling imagery, all of which sounds just like my kind of thing.Sure enough, the opening scene immediately presented me with a disturbing sight that I will find it hard to erase from my fragile little mind: Willem Dafoe having sex with Charlotte Gainsbourg (Dafoe's freaky weird face is enough to give me the shivers; seeing him going at it with the equally unappealing Gainsbourg was just a little too much for me to take).It is during this fugly bump and grind session that the couple's toddler decides to go for a little stroll and winds up falling to his death out of a window (as he walked past their bedroom, he spied his mum and dad shagging—maybe it was all too much for him to take as well!); it's the death of this little boy that is the crux for Von Trier's film.In four chapters, the director studies the grief, pain, despair and madness of the child's mother (who, as it transpires, had been losing her marbles long before her kid did a high dive onto the sidewalk), details her husband's struggle to cope with her condition, and comments on the nature of evil via some abstruse visuals, cramming in some really nasty violence in the process (hoorah!), but sadly, also boring me rigid with an onslaught of pretentious, artsy-fartsy garbage (I knew it! I knew it!).Certainly, this film delivers the goods in terms of shock value—clitoris snipping, penis smashing (and a subsequent bloody hand-job), leg drilling, graphic masturbation, and several shots of animals in varying degrees of manginess, but there's also a whole heap of dull, ponderous, introspective dialogue, an excess of pseudo-intellectual symbolism, and a glut of esoteric artistic claptrap. You know, the sort of stuff that the intelligentsia delight in analysing ad-nauseum, but which most people will find utterly intolerable.",Antichrist
8,Quinoa1984,"'Chaos Reigns' over an artful/artsy, ponderous trip through empty provocation",4,31 October 2009,"There are a great many filmmakers who I would love to pick their brains about their choices and thoughts on a particular movie they made. Even if I don't like the filmmaker very much on the whole, a film might intrigue me enough to want to ask this or that or the other about scenes and shots and character decisions. Lars von Trier, with his film Antichrist specifically, is not one of them. This is a film made by its maker with a real personal attachment, but not the kind that would give us a catharsis by the amount of pain that he's going through. I won't say that von Trier is a hack, since he isn't. He is a director with a point of view and an artistic intent that has gained him the notoriety he's gotten and that he's probably sure he deserves. Is Antichrist something? Boy howdy it is. But is it something to want to pick a filmmaker's brain about? Not at all. It's all up their on the screen, and it's one big hateful batch of s***.And no, I don't mean to be facetious by saying a curse word there. It's how a movie can leave you feeling that can be significant, and Antichrist made me feel bad, for the actors, for the situations they were put in, for von Trier's own mental state, frankly. His story of a couple- ""He"" and ""She"" (ho-ho, get it, Bible stuff folks)- who go to a cabin in the woods to expurgate feelings of dread and horror after the death of their infant, was made during a state of depression in von Trier's life. Duly noted: the film is about not so much the characters, since they aren't exactly characters in the sense that you can really connect with them and go through an emotional journey with them that even if it's harsh and unforgiving will give some kind of release (i.e. Requiem for a Dream). Von Trier isn't interested in characters. He's putting his symbolic-metaphoric-what-have-you's, and us, and himself, through the wringer.I don't mind when a director takes a very tragic state of affairs on his/her characters and takes them to logical conclusions and side-steps conventions. On the contrary, it's something I hope comes through as truthfully as possible that the material would allow. But Antichrist negates feeling anything except dread and horror, and despite a few scenes in the first couple of chapters that speak to the grim potential of the material, of a husband who takes over as therapist for his wife who breaks down practically every night from the grief and fear her dead son has put her in (among a couple other things like the nature of Nature), its a film less interested in reality than with METAPHOR (in caps).Everything means something here, be it the animals (deer, fox, crow), the map of the figures like the three beggars, the the slow-motion walk through the field to the turn-to-green moment, the child's distorted feet, the bodies laid out on the tree as He and She have masochistic sex there. And, ultimately, it really doesn't mean anything after a while. Perhaps the fox has a point when he/it says in a James Earl Jones growl, ""Chaos Reigns"", but is it interesting chaos? Not really. Some may cling happily (or, no, not the right word... agreeably and intensely) to Von Trier's poetic flights of fancy, and Anthony Dod Mantle is game to give some intensity with the hand-held lens (sometimes sloppily, which I guess is the point too).And the acting is intense too, lest not forget that. Maybe so intense that it too becomes ponderous and of the same thing over and over. Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg go for whatever Von Trier demands of them, and they do it with such bravura and ripping-out-of-their-souls (more-so Gainsbourg than Dafoe) that you do want to get some catharsis from their characters. There is none, as far as I could tell without having to go through a bloody thesis paper myself. What does it mean that the penis orgasms blood or that the fox says Chaos Reigns or that She does something very self-destructive very late in the game? It means, really, that Von Trier wants a rise out of us. It certainly isn't logical how She has this sudden turn from self-inflicted pain to going bat-s*** midway through the third chapter, so it's really just a artful (or artsy) shock-em slew of scenes.Antichrist can be read into, and can lead to some interesting conversations once it's finally ended with its rather irksome Tarkovsky dedication (seriously, because of that ending? really?). It's made by a filmmaker with something to say, and he says it any and every way he damn well pleases (or hates to maybe). It's a thoroughly unpleasant work to take or leave. I tried it, and now I leave it. Period.",Antichrist
9,LeonLouisRicci,An Uneasy View of a Disturbing Hypnotic Display,8,21 July 2014,"Disturbing to the Extreme and Beautifully Photographed this Exercise in Depression, Possession, and Surrealism is a Film that Cannot be Recommended for the Casual Movie Goer or for those Easily Upset by Unsettling Images. There is a Unique Quality to this Tale Told from the Perspective of a Couple Suffering the Death of Their Infant Son. The Aftermath and what turns out to be the Forerunner of the Child and His Place in the Story is Unfolded at a Languishing Pace that is Framed in Artistic Squalor and Slow Motion Excess.Much of this is Cerebral while at the Same Time the Layers are Played Out in Storybook Chapters with Profound Titles Linking it Together with a 1-2-3 Format that seems Neatly Arranged. The Images are Also Precisely Staged with Flamboyant Nature Scenes Drenched in Rain and Foliage that Surround Humanity in an Overwhelming Onslaught that Create a Prison Paradise Lost.It is a Hypnotic Display of Ancient Historical Research that Devolves into Incoherent Scribblings and Sexual Psychotherapeutic ""Cures"" for a Condition that is more Spiritual than Emotional. The Film has No Easy Answers to Anything it Asks Concerning the Human Condition and Gender Predetermination. It Uses Gross-Out Violence Aimed at the Genetailia and it is at once Eye-Diversional and Gut-Turning.Nothing here is Easy Going. It is a Hard Look at Hard to Understand Psychology and Religiosity.

10,poolandrews,Lmost impossible to categorize.,5,9 April 2012,"Antichrist starts as a psychiatrist (Willem Dafoe) & his wife (Charlotte Gainsbourg) are having sex in their apartment, meanwhile in the other room their young son Nic (Storm Acheche Sahlstrøm) decides to open his window & jump out of it to his inevitable death several storeys on the ground below. Both his parents are devastated but his mother in particular takes it very badly, her husband takes her on as a patient in order to help themselves through their terrible grief & starts to have sessions with her. Eventually he thinks that she needs to confront her fears & together they venture out to Eden Forest to stay in a small cabin, there she becomes convinced that all women are evil & just to prove her point she tortures & abuses her husband in violent & horrible ways...This Danish, German, Italian, Sweedish, Polish & French co-production was written & directed by acclaimed award winning Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier, Antichrist was von Trier's first film in three years since the dark comedy The Boss of it All (2006) between which he suffered from a deep depression & wrote the script for Antichrist during that period. First thing to say is that Antichrist is a very abstract & arty film with some moments of severe brutality & explicit sex which is probably where it's infamous reputation comes from, I am not really sure what sort of film von Trier was trying to make here but it's a bit of a mess & a bit of mixed bag although one that is startling at times. The title Antichrist is a puzzle, it seems to relate to nothing that occurs on screen & is maybe there purely to offend another section of the audience which von Trier appears happy to do. The script for Antichrist deals with some serious issues & it deals with them in an unflinching & raw way which is as far from the usual happy ever after mentality of the average Hollywood production, themes about grief & child death are tackled head on & it can get a bit grim at times. The film is very threadbare & gives little back-story to the only two character's in the film, they are merely seen as 'He' & 'She' & are given no sort of background other than the central theme of loss. At an hour & forty minutes long Antichrist is divided into four chapter's, the Prologue, 'Greif, Pain (Chaos Reigns), Despair (Gynocide)', 'The Three Beggars' & a final Epilogue with the film split into two as the first half of Antichrist plays out like a family drama as the two parents grieve for their dead son while the second half sees the nastiness kick in with blood, genital mutilation & torture. Antichrist is a difficult film to recommend, I didn't hate it & it kept me watching but I didn't find it fun or entertaining & maybe it isn't supposed to be but I just found it a bit grim & downbeat & abstract for my liking.Antichrist received a special 'Anti' award from the ecumenical jury at the 2010 Cannes film festival for it's misogynistic views. Certainly well made the opening Prologue shot in slow motion in black and white & set to classical music from from the Handel opera Rodelina is both beautiful & disturbing. Antichrist also features some nasty violence as genitals are mutilated, Gainsbourg cuts her own clit off with a pair of scissors & drills a large hole in Dafoe's leg. There's sight of real hardcore sex & masturbation although overall I really wasn't sure of von trier was trying to say & the film doesn't really seem to have much of a message (well, one that I could understand anyway) despite it's seriousness & abstract artfulness.With a supposed budget of about $11,000,000 this had a decent amount of money spent on it, filmed in Westphalia in Germany. The acting from the only two people in the entire film is good.Antichrist is a difficult film to describe or categorize or recommend but as something different & well made & arty Antichrist isn't that bad I suppose & it does have some very startling & attention grabbing moments. I can't say I loved it but I didn't hate it either, memorable if not exactly much fun to watch.",Antichrist
11,Bunuel1976,"ANTICHRIST (Lars von Trier, 2009) *1/2",3,23 January 2010,"Initially, I was to have watched this a couple of months ago following the high recommendation of a friend of mine and, seeing it named as ""the all-time greatest horror movie"" by a recent online poll by Sky, almost made me include it in this year's Halloween Challenge. However, it was finally the fact that two fellow HTFers watched this simultaneously that made me get to it and, consequently, break cyber silence. My measly rating is a tell-tale sign of how I came to feel about it and, if I were being economic, I would dismiss it in just five words: ""ANTICHRIST is a f*****g bore"". However, I know I will have to do better than that – firstly, to be true to myself and also because my friends (and regular readers) have come to expect no less. To begin with, I have to dispel the hypothetical myth that this film can only be relevant to (or fully understood by) people that are married or in a steady relationship and have children of their own; my mother was no long-lost prostitute, my brother has not been driven mad by religious fervor and I have no serious physical deformities but that did not stop (respectively) SANSHO THE BAILIFF (1954), ORDET (1955) and THE ELEPHANT MAN (1980) from making me teary-eyed while watching them! Admirable technical aspects aside (the decision to film in black-and-white and in slow motion and have it accompanied by choral music), the prologue felt vastly overdone from the get-go: watching these two characters make love, one would think that they had just discovered the act itself – which, naturally, is not the case since they have a son already who, at that very moment, is). Given that their love-making antics provoked (willfully or not, consciously or otherwise) the trauma that afflicts them at present, it would have made much more sense to make the woman shun the sexual act and her husband's company but, Dogme '95-style shooting notwithstanding, von Trier seems to have had anything but realism on his mind when making this; in fact, the husband not only becomes his wife's shrink (cue endless reams of pretentious psycho-babble that elicit bland responses) but she periodically shags him senseless (as remuneration perhaps?). While I do not think that shacking up in a wooden cabin in the middle of nowhere makes much therapeutic sense either, at least, this viewer could appreciate the film's one positive aspect: its fantastically-subverted antropomorphism (by which I mean the views of forest animals in their natural habitat and von Trier's occasionally hallucinatory shots of talking foxes, undead birds and the observant ""Three Beggars""). To come now to the film's controversial pornographic elements – of both the sexual and torture varieties: von Trier may think otherwise but, frankly, erect penises and masturbation have become old hat material by now after almost 40 years of regular usage in both the 'significant' and exploitative fields of European art-house cinema; on the other hand, my prior knowledge of what was going to happen did not stop me from laughing hysterically at the point where the wife implants the husband's leg with a 'mechanical' contraption! I am being purposefully vague on the actual details involved so as not to spoil the thing for some poor, adventurous soul who feels the need to get every film maudit under his wing. Finally, the stars of the film – Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg – have been lauded here and elsewhere for their bravery in accepting these challenging (and potentially damaging) roles but, again, Dafoe had 'proven' himself already by being a rebellious, sexually-experienced Christ for Martin Scorsese back in 1988 and one would hardly expect the daughter of that notoriously taboo-bashing couple Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin – of whom, incidentally, I have accumulated a handful of films lately which (thankfully?) I have yet to see – to play it safe artistically!",Antichrist

What is beyond doubt is that Charlotte Gainsbourg turns in an exceptional performance which deservedly won her Best Actress at Cannes and I write as one who has hitherto been indifferent to Ms. Gainsbourg but does know outstanding film acting when it walks up and bites me in the leg. The cynic in me congratulates helmer Lars Von Trier for dreaming up something that is guaranteed to 1) be controversial and 2) keep everyone guessing as to what the hell it is about if it is, in fact, about anything at all other than attracting the Dirty Mac brigade to the Art House.",Antichrist

Reportedly many people walked out when it was shown at Cannes. Those who make the effort to stay wit the film will be rewarded.The cinematography is brilliant, and the acting by Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg is superb.It is basically a reason versus emotion narrative as Dafoe attempts to help his wife deal with the death of their child.Or, maybe I missed the point entirely.",Antichrist

Unfortunately, Antichrist falls in the latter category.The movie consists of long drawn-out dialogues and imagery that go nowhere, interspersed with the occasional scene that is there purely for shock value. Tedious pretentiousness parading as some sort of great essay on the human psyche, or human relationships, or dealing with grief - who knows, pick one.A total waste of time.",Antichrist
15,trashgang,the art of horror,7,18 February 2010,"To be honest, this is my first Lars movie. But I have heard of the man before. Making movies you just don't understand. Something like David Lynch movies. So I have no problem by watching them but this one came to me stated as horror. I couldn't make it up that Lars was making that kind of flick. So I plugged it in into the new world of HD and Blu Ray. Let me first say this, this one has to been watched on Blu Ray in 1080p to see it all and experiencing the slo mo scene's. Again I was frightened to see Willem Dafoe in a horror or even Gainsbourg. But was I wrong. This is so beautifully shot, the use of light and camera. the use of the colors. You really must see it to believe it. There is a lot of nudity in it, even explicit from both actors. And the movie clocks in over the classic 90 minutes just with 2 actors. And it works, but again, you really have to be into arty movies to watch it. It's cruel, some animals being killed or being hurt. But the shot with the fox, man, this is really arty. But it takes a while before the horror comes in but again, when it comes it is again very explicit. The things happening to Willem, well, you guys out there, you will take a deep breath. You will need to watch it more than once to get it all but still, remarkable good stuff.",Antichrist
16,HumanoidOfFlesh,Subversive art of horror.,9,3 June 2009,"""Antichrist"" by Lars von Trier has to be one of the most perplexing psychological horror movies I have ever seen.It's loaded with invented symbolism,explicit sex and graphic violence.The film is clearly influenced by Nietzsche's essay ""Guilt,Bad Conscience and the like"" from his book ""On the Genealogy of Morals"" with its main themes of life and death,guilt,castration,punishment,torture,grief,sacrifice of the first-born and 'the forest is the devil's church' as well as the symbolic 'Antichrist'.In a prologue a couple is having passionate and graphically detailed sexual intercourse.Their child escapes their watch and accidentally dies.The wife becomes severely depressed and traumatized,so the husband takes her to an isolated shack in the forest ironically called Eden to apply his aggressive methods of psychotherapy.""Antichrist"" is clearly the most personal film of Lars von Trier.The director has stated that ""Antichrist"" was a form of therapy for him following a long period of depression.There is pretty shocking scene of cliteroctomy with rusty scissors and an ejaculation of blood.The story is heavy with rich symbolism for example a baby bird falls dead out of a nest covered in ants or a fox lies dead in the grass eating its own entrails.The acting by Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourgh is brave and the scene with talking fox totally cracked me up.All in all,""Antichrist"" is a bizarre,compelling,uncompromising and profoundly disturbing film.I can't recommend it enough.9 out of 10.",Antichrist
17,christopher-underwood,A difficult but worthwhile cinematic journey,9,30 March 2019,"At last a film that everyone can enjoy. Well, perhaps not. This is unremittingly grim, beautifully made and shot, perfectly acted with fine script but it is not an easy watch. 'That's life!' Lars might respond and indeed he would have a point. Truly there is nothing here that is unbelievable or unnatural (I use the word advisedly) and yet there is a relentlessly depressing tone with an ultimately pessimistic outlook. Willem Dafoe portrays the caring, sharing, understanding and maybe controlling husband helping his wife, Charlotte Gainsbourg to overcome the death of their child but she cannot adjust and appears to be losing her mind. Things get worse and worse and we are forced to engage in a battle between realistic and naturalistic and by inference, man and woman. Deeply affecting with many troublesome moments, the cinematic journey is worthwhile but difficult.",Antichrist
18,siderite,Being too smart can hurt a film,7,21 November 2009,"I was expecting something shocking from Trier, even if it weren't for all the buzz around the film. I did however expect something more exciting because Willem Dafoe was in it. You can already expect some things knowing the film is made by the guy that did Dogville and Epidemic and that the movie is dedicated to Tarkovski.The graphics are beautiful, a great deal of effort was spent in the visual details of the movie. Also, a lot of the script points at some very deep things. What they are, I cannot say. They are either too smart, too stupid or both. This is where the movie lost it for me. It is was like the movie equivalent of avantgarde theater. It's stunning, but you can't say what the hell they are doing. And I don't even like normal theater.Bottom line: I personally believe that an artist is a communicator, meaning he has not only to say something, but to say it in a way that people understand it. At this level it failed for me. I didn't get it. My general feeling for the film is that it is terribly slow and leads nowhere. The only thing I could understand is that whether it is heaven or hell, a woman must be involved somewhere. ;)",Antichrist
19,thesar-2,Small Eden,5,11 April 2015,"I had two days to think about this movie and wrote two reviews on both days:Day One's Reaction: I get when a movie wants to be incredibly smart, deep, blows you away...and that's okay for people who like to think a ton during a feature. I don't mind that, but it was sometimes hard to think during some of the more brutal scenes, even the less bloody ones as in the first five minutes. I have heard this was one of the most grotesque films made and I was totally wondering if that was true an hour and 10 minutes in and BAM, yep, very hard to watch. Yeah, I had to turn away a couple of times. When it comes down to it, the message isn't too hard to figure out and once you do, you're left with an all- but NC-17 stage play bent on extreme brutality. Eh. fulfilled my curiosity.Day Two's Retraction: Initially I gave ANTICHRIST ★★/5 stars but, since it has haunted me all day today, and I mean, I just can't get certain scenes out of my head, bloody volcano to put it way mildly, and the acting and originality was not that bad, I changed my mind to ★★★/5 stars. BUT...that's not a recommendation. In fact, just the opposite.Years back. I have the most grotesque film I have ever seen, and to date, THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE PART 2 still holds that record, ★★★/5 stars and I warned all over my review: despite the not-bad rating, the movie should never be seen. By anyone. Ever. EVER.Same here. Despite both movies being well made, and mostly original, they cross lines that should never been seen by anyone. I'm even gonna do my best to not ever think about what I saw last night, and I hope for your sake, you don't have to experience that...horror.",Antichrist
20,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Artsy fartsy stuff that will bemuse and amaze in equal measure,7,16 February 2010,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning From the film noir opening, where we get an up close and personal shot of the film's central couple shagging, with the soft classical music and slow motion filming style, it's clear director Lars Van Troyer had his heart set on a deep, meaningful art house film here. Then the couple's kid falls out a window (which they've stupidly left open in the freezing cold snow?!?) and it descends into an exploration of different chapters, including grief, pain, loss and madness, as the couple head off into the woods, the psychiatrist husband (Willem Defoe) trying to get to the bottom of his patient in the shape of his bereaved wife, and as guilt and recrimination take over, the stage is set for further tragedy. With an already grim story at hand, Von Troyer experiments with the weirdly subversive (a fox proclaiming 'chaos reigns' being the weirdest part?!?) I'm obviously not as smart as he thinks he is, so maybe I can't appreciate this on all the levels I was meant to, but for strong stomached art-house connoisseurs, this might prove quite a feast. ***",Antichrist
21,paul2001sw-1,Decayed Kingdom,4,21 November 2013,"Lars von Trier has made many brilliant, madly provocative films in his career, but in 'Antichrist', he finally overshoots. The movie is a horror film, of sorts: the story of a grief-stricken woman who goes mad, as if demonically possessed. The film uses many of the staple tropes of the genre: a setting out in the woods, a mood that is almost naturalistic (is this a tale of human madness, or something else?) and the idea of female sexuality as demonic. But what's interesting about the latter idea is the notion that society chooses to view female sexuality as such, whereas von Trier's film actually seems to be endorsing the conclusion; in any case, the idea provides an excuse for the inclusion of some extremely sexually explicit scenes, which duly shock, but which don't appear to have an external justification. In spite of the film's title, there's no reference to Christ or any conventional idea of Satan, just vague ideas about natural evil. And the structure of the film is highly uneven: a frankly boring first half, before the horrific second part. The problem is, it's hard to see what von Trier is trying to say with this movie, beyond the banal assertion that guilt, hate, desire and nature can sometimes combine with horrific effect, and thus provide the pretext for a film that is uncomfortable to watch, but doesn't really challenge it's audience's values (except for their preferences, perhaps, to watch something more entertaining and pleasant). If you want to see von Trier tackle the subject of the devil with more humour, insight and wit, watch his early television series 'Kingdom' instead",Antichrist
22,dromasca,dark and disturbing,8,13 December 2018,"Lars von Trier does not run away from extremes, he is actually looking for them all over his cinematographic career. Even his more 'moderate' films, like the TV series 'The Kingdom' or his first great successes 'Europa' and 'Breaking the Waves' included innovative television or cinematographic elements. Later he went toward extremes in almost every film that he directed. 'Dogville' is a dry and theoretic example of where the Dogma school can reach, 'Melancholia' is the most beautiful end of the world ever filmed, while 'Nymphomaniac' explores the borders of sexuality. 'Antichrist' belongs to the later phase of his career, one in which each of his film must come with disclaimers and warnings, requiring viewers to follow him in unexplored territories which in most cases are dark and frightening.Up to a certain point the story in 'Antichrist' can be told. He (Willem Dafoe) and She (Charlotte Gainsbourg) are faced with the nightmare of any couple of parents - their young boy falls from the window and dies. She feels grief and remorse (the accident took place while they were making love). He is a psychiatrist and tries to cure her grief renouncing medication and confronting her with the roots of her fears, which may reside in a trip taken together with their son one year earlier, in the woods. The couple will go together to that place in order to complete the cure, but this will open the Pandora box of the worsening of the relations between them, under the threat of Nature which far from being friendly or neutral seems to become more of a Satanic threat. This is approximately the point until the story may be the topic of many films in a range from the romantic thriller to horror. From now on however Lars von Trier takes the viewers to unexplored territory, to dark zones for which 'horror' or even 'sadism' are two words that can be considered euphemisms. Man to Woman become cruel predators, nature amplifies the terror, and no graphical detail of the mutual destruction is spared from viewers. I can guess that all public viewings of this film witnessed people leaving the cinema theater because they were not capable of seeing more of the cruelty on the screen.What's the point? I will not claim to have the key. It seems to be the work of a tormented soul, belonging to the category of dark and macabre products which some will consider art maybe at its extreme, and other will believe it's trash or even pornography. I personally incline to side the extreme art opinion. It is a very dark and pessimistic story that hits viewers in their stomachs, but its aesthetic value especially in cinematography, sound and music cannot be denied. The story also holds a message - too much rationality can give birth to monsters, same as the sleep of ration, especially when it comes to curing grief after an irreparable loss. Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg assumed the risk of acting in a film which must have been very demanding from a physical but also psychological point of view. They did well, but something was missing. If there ever was love between their two characters, this never came up on screen. Is the amount of violence, sexuality and gore on screen justified? This is a question to ask Lars von Trier.",Antichrist
23,secondtake,"Raw, as deep as you'll let it get, and with violence that defies its own metaphor",7,21 September 2009,"Antichrist (2009)The meaning of life, of sanity, of love, of lovemaking, of power, of death, of secrecy, of trust. Not for the weak of heart, but definitely for those on any kind of search in their lives.How can you not be moved and disturbed by such personal cruelty as you see in Antichrist? Once you recover from the assault, which is part of the point the same way it was for some artists from the 1980s, you wonder what further point there is to it. What is the meaning of all those faceless women at the end? What really was the woman's role in the child's death? Are the child's shoes simple cruelty, or something more, about things being the opposite of what they should be, Eden and evil in some subtextual way? And the evil of sex? For real? For them or for us?The first half of the movie is stronger, depending less on sensation and more on psychology and the complex relationship between two people in the worst of situations. The apparent loving patience of the man, played by Willem Dafoe, and the more obvious breakdown and withdrawal in the woman, his partner, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, are at odds in part because of the role he takes as her therapist, to draw her out of her decline. At first we think we are seeing the most intense and unsequestered view of a couple's inner life, and it is partly this drawing us in (seeing everything from a closeup of sex with unabashed orgasms to the woman pounding her forehead on the toilet until it bleeds, the man rushing to violently stop her) that makes us trust the movie. We know things are bad, and they are for real.The edgy reality never leaves us, even as events get torturous (literally)--the pain, the blood, the screaming all make sense, and are disturbing, deeply. The movie succeeds that far, and very well, remarkably well, like Cassavetes in Hell. The events are highly metaphoric--the unnamed man and woman go to a cabin in a woods called Eden. The rising thread there is not of insanity but of some kind of supernatural force, call it evil or just a kind of grand dementia, and it demands another kind of plausibility, and interpretation. And for me it starts to get forced. As their interactions become more about survival and avoidance, and just plain insanity, they become simpler. To say they are incredible (in every sense of the word) is to critique the core of the ending--it is no longer about how the couple copes with grief, but with a man's survival as his wife is overcome with evil.I don't know what theory of evil makes sense in a movie, and I know it has to somehow be cinematic, but Antichrist stumbles into at least one cheap cliché with a parade of medieval engravings of satanic and bizarre events. The movie is so original in other ways this was a sudden letdown, a cheap relaxation of intensity. As well, to have the man stumble on the woman's book and realize some of the truths of her state of mind comes too late, and without enough suspicion.But overlook these drawbacks, if you can. The portrayal of madness is really brave and beautiful. The direction and writing by Lars von Trier is bold top to bottom. The music is ominous as deep, throaty chords grow selectively. And the cinematography is by the man behind the camera in The Last King of Scotland and Slumdog Millionaire, Anthony Dod Mantle. The surreal touches are restrained but when the arrive they are shocking--animals suffering, acorns pounding on the metal roof. And the acting, above all, has such naturalistic honesty it sustains even the most gratuitous violence. Evil? Well, to portray evil surely requires some bad things to happen, and they happen. I'm not sure if the man, as an Adam kind of man, is meant to be angelic, but his kindness is laced with detachment and reason when it might need humor and warmth. And the woman, an Eve of sorts, for sure, has certainly been tempted by a snake of some kind (we are to assume it is his personal snake, which figures prominently in both love and violence), and she enacts evil without hesitation against it. But all of this comes about without the campy or florid cruelty of a mainstream horror flick. This is the real thing, a real attempt at getting at the fire of sex and the possibility of it ruining us somehow, deeply and cruelly.A depressing view of things, but a sometimes brilliant one. An imperfect movie in many ways--it even seems like a cheap amateur film at times, and is often highly affective. But it is also effective, and has near perfect moments, beautiful ones, ones that will, without sentiment, broach the most intimate subjects.",Antichrist

26,ironhorse_iv,OMG! What a bizarre film! Chaos indeed reigns.,7,6 September 2019,"The first motion picture in director Lars Von Trier's ""Depression"" trilogy, followed close by 2011 'Melancholia' & 2013 'Nymphomaniac'. 'Anti-Christ' is divided into a prologue, four chapters and an epilogue. It tells the story of an unnamed couple played by William Dafoe & Charlotte Gainsbourg whom after the death of their child, retreat to a cabin in the woods, in order to recover from their trauma but instead experiences increasingly violent & deadly sexual behaviors between them. Without spoiling this arthouse horror movie too much; after its premiere at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, the motion picture was surrounded by controversy. First off, the movie's shocking graphic nudity scenes of genitals getting mutilated cause many audiences members to faint. Many couldn't handle the gore & violence despite how little of that sensationalism punishing allegory interpretation of the biblical undoing of creation is in the film's runtime of an hour and 40 minutes. In truth, most of the film is spend on slow near silent deliberately blurred motion dreamlike visuals filler that seem to drag or odd lingering shots of animal & plant life. Not only that but the pseudoscience dialogue about the natural world being inhabited with evil was too confusing & muddled than sophistical. After all, some of the symbolism like the three beggars (The grieving deer, the despairing crow and painful fox) aren't not that well developed or explained. Was Mother Nature AKA Eden, the antichrist? Who knows!? At least, the black and white opening and ending visuals with composer George Frederic Handel's masterpiece ""Lascia ch'io pianga' playing was all perverse beautiful shot by Oscar winning cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle. That said, the movie is still disturbing with all its dead babies symbolism like a fallen chick being eaten by ants or a stillborn fetus hanging from the hindquarters of the bounding mother deer to earn the movie, a NC-17 rating. Plus being banned in France nearly 7 years after its release, despite being co-produced by Canal plus (a French Company). As magnificent as the performers acting is, especially Gainsbourg who won Best Actress by the Cannes jury, their characters are so unlikeable that it's a turn off. First off, all of the psychological subjecting that the husband does to his depressed wife is highly annoying & unrealistic. All his patriarchal put downs is uncalled for. Yes I know the film is criticizing the exposure therapy treatment where an anxiety ridden patient is gradually exposed to the source of their irrational fear as the director had undergone this treatment for his own anxiety problems but this is extreme version that doesn't really existed. The true point of exposure therapy is to treat anxiety without the intention to cause any danger to the patient wellbeing. As for the wife; her own self-loathing through violent acts of mutilation and torture of a man she supposedly loves with is a bit much for me to take. Her historic viewpoints about women being tortured and killed in history because they were born evil is not even that accurate; seeing how according to the section about the European Witch Hunts on Gendercide.org. It shows that during the time periods of the witch hunts, the majority of women were not affected. The majority was targeted were foreign men. Only about fifty five percent of people who thought they were bewitched were of the female gender. Maybe that's the point of the film that inconsolable grief can cause people of sound reasoning to act irregular and abnormal, resulting them back to their animalistic nature of killing and procreating; which the Bible deem as savage and non-Christian behavior. Nevertheless I still found this movie to heavy handed and misinformation preachy. Regardless, it didn't stop many critics from dismissing it as pretentious and empty. However the most common complaint about the film is that blatantly misogynistic. After all, von Trier's previous record of psychologically torturing and debasing his female characters is highly infamous. It doesn't help that the title card and much of the promotional art, the t in the word 'antichrist' is suggested by a figure combining the Christian cross and the symbol for woman. If this is misogyny, it's a far more complex and nuanced form of misogyny than the simple prejudice. It's the one from the deepest recesses of the director's troubled psyche. It was very clear that the director was suffering from extreme melancholy when he made this movie. Nevertheless this form of self-therapy coping mechanism did not work. Trier was reportedly suffering from depression even after this film and attempting to exorcise his own personal demons by getting into fights with journalists & critics by declaring himself the best director in the world, as well as dedicate his movie to fame filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky without much fanfare. Overall: While I don't believe this film to be artless Euroshlock like some critics. As there are really powerful haunting scenes like Gainsbourg's character hearing babies crying around Eden. I do think this nihilistic psychological horror film could had been better. Unlike the biblical forbidden tree of knowledge, this sour fruit of movie is not quite worth biting into.",Antichrist
27,Rodrigo_Amaro,"Almost appealed to me. Weak, boring and poorly made.",5,21 November 2011,"Weighing down this movie with all its good and bad things I came to the conclusion that it wasn't one of the best I've ever seen. The bad things in it were far more heavy than the good things which caused this counter balance and in the end, thumbs down to this.Adam and Eve of the future and in backwards, or better He and She (played by Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg) are a couple trying to save their marriage and solve all of their problems while staying in a retreat somewhere in the woods. Their relationship is hanging on a tightrope when they start to question everything in their lives after their son's tragic death, who felt from a window, while they were having sex (most impressive moment right in the first minutes, filmed in slow motion and in black and white). Controversial director Lars von Trier fills his images with a strange and brutal view of the woman, guilty of such tragedy to the point of committing barbaric acts of self-mutilation of her own genitals or hurting her partner in the most bizarre and hurtful ways. In all of this, the man tries hard to rescue the woman, helping her in the way he feels it's the best, outside of hospitals and conventional psychiatrists (even though he himself is a therapist who lost his, should I say faith, in this kind of medicine).It's often said that over thinking can only ruin you, and in a way this is quite right but I thought over and over about what I've just seen to clear myself of all the mixed feelings this film left me. It's strange originality, the way certain religious symbolisms are used and Willem Dafoe's performances were the only parameters that I can say were the positive things about ""Antichrist"". Poorly executed and written (dialogs are so weak and inaudible at times), uglily filmed, terribly slow to the point of make you extremely bored, ""Antichrist"" comes as a pretentious work from a director who is good enough to make you involved in his other works but not in this one. Deprived of feelings and trapped in a nightmarish atmosphere so empty trying to be full, this film is like a figure skater who slides without any grace even trying hard to get up and finish his/her number, it may appeal to some, but it certainly will fail with those with good eyes to see the flaws.In his attempt to make an horror film, the director of ""Dogville"" while trying to cure his depression haven't dealt with the theme with profundity or a sense of reality. He dedicates this to Andrei Tarkovsky, which is quite odd (fairly understandable though) but he never achieves the greatness of working with a reality extremed with fictional strange elements and symbols like the Russian master who, I believe, could make a film like this but a hundred times better. Approaching philosophical themes and terrifying audiences wasn't that good in Trier's film, only Bergman knew how to do it, to create a shock and make people think without being boring.And the shocking parts must be mentioned here. Well, it's really hard to make me feel disgusted or terrified with something but ""Antichrist"" really injects unimaginable things that makes you appalled (I won't say anything about the pornographic image at the opening because I share the director's view of such thing being natural, real and never harmful, as he said on a interview). And the woman commits them all, whether cutting herself in her intimate parts (exposed here with a certain normality) or torturing her husband. If focused on the level of a reflective drama this movie would work better; but then we have the awkward presence of horror and such low sequences that looks like were thrown in the film to make the viewer awake. In its intent of shock, they succeed perfectly.It's really hard to get involved with this thing, Cannes made a mistake in giving a best actress award for Charlotte, who was completely annoying here. It really blows. 5/10",Antichrist
28,tomgillespie2002,"No masterpiece, but visually stunning",6,4 July 2011,"It's quite difficult to know what exactly to say about this film. Danish film maker Lars Von Trier has nearly always been the provocateur. From the penetration of The Idiots (1998), to the comments at this years Cannes Film Festival, where he claimed to essentially be a Nazi, Von Trier knows how to spark controversy, and generally gage reactions from both critics and audiences alike. This brings us to his 2009 offering, Antichrist, Starring Wilem Defoe and Charlotte Gainbourg. Never referred to by name within the narrative, they are only named in the credits as simply He and She.In the opening prologue, He and She are interlocked in passionate copulation, unaware that their toddler, Nic, has woken and climbed out from his cot. Nic makes his way to the window where he falls to his death. From here-on, the film is broken into chapters of emotions: Chapter one is grief; Chapter two, pain; Chapter three, despair; and four, the three beggars (this refers to the previous chapters titles' incarnations as animals - a deer (grief), a fox (pain), and a crow (despair). He, a psychotherapist, takes on the task of counselling She after her breakdown, and brings her through the chapters emotional arc. They retreat to a cabin in the woods, that they refer to as Eden.It is here that they begin to fall apart, She becomes more sexually aggressive, which culminates in some of the more controversial imagery (such as She cutting her clitoris off with scissors - and image that is shot in extreme close-up). A dying fox lifts it's head to a perplexed He, and states ""chaos reigns"". The breakdown of the relationship is countered by ideas and images of nature - both human and of the woodland outside the cabin. Decay and death in nature is represented with the three animals. In one scene She states that ""nature is Satan's church"". We are not really sure what is real, and what may be dreamed or imagined in this text. He and She (apart from Nic) are the only characters to occupy the narrative. In two scenes where others do inhabit the mise-en- scene, their faces are totally blurred out of the image.Whilst much of the column space that was dedicated to the film in the media focused on the imagery (it was also given the oblique title of torture-porn), almost as much vehemence directed at Von Trier accused him of being a misogynist. I can see why this may have been the case. However, I believe that both characters had intrinsic hatred for each other.At the end, we discover that the film is dedicated to Russian film maker/genius, Andrei Tarkovsky. I did not know this to begin with, and some of the more beautiful, idyllic cinematography did remind me of some of his work. The log cabin reminded me of the house and surroundings of the mother character in Tarkovsky's The Mirror (1975). Antichrist really does have some incredibly beautiful shots. The opening, whilst permeated with horror, is so visually stunning. There are these moments of slow- motion that conjure pure artistry. The film is no masterpiece, not by a long shot. It does stir the emotions though, and this is really down to the performances. Gainbourg certainly deserved the best actress award at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival: her portrait of grief and (possible) slid into insanity, is remarkable.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Antichrist
29,Dr_Coulardeau,Unjustified reference to Christ,9,25 July 2014,"This film is the story of a couple with an important age difference, a professor and a doctorate student with a young child, a toddler actually. One night when they make hectic love in the bathroom, on the washing machine, in the living room, etc, the child wakes up and they do not hear the call in the baby surveillance unit that might not have been on. He gets out of his bed, through the baby gate, sees his parents, goes back to his room, pushes a chair to the table, climbs on the chair, then on the table, then on the window ledge because the window is open. There is snow there because it is snowing. He slips and falls. The film is the story of the mother's subsequent depression treated by her husband who is supposed to be a head shrink.This is the fundamental mistake. A psycho-therapy cannot be performed by a person directly connected to the patient: members of the family and above all sexual partners. He knows that because he tries to cut sex off, but he cannot resist to her neurosis or psychosis that is taking hold of her and forces sex onto him as a poison for herself. The second mistake is to isolate with her in a mountain cabin far from everything and any communication line. He broke there the normal procedure in which the relation doctor-patient has to remain within the frame of a socially situated and defined setting, method, process, with help within easy reach. These two mistakes become dramatic when he discovers the mother had systematically and probably for a long time put the shoes left side right on the feet of the baby. He knew something was wrong because of the autopsy performed on the child that noted a deformity in the feet, which could explain the accident on the window ledge. You add that deformity to the fact that the window was open and rather easily reachable and you have a criminal scenario, maybe unconscious but definitely from a criminal mind. The man finds confirmation of this ""torturing"" with pictures of the child on which the shoes are always right side left. He finds these pictures in their isolation, and then this guilt gets into her head and she becomes convinced she has to do something to purge it.The doctor and husband should have known that she was to come to this breaking point for various reasons: 1- The torturing reveals she wanted to make the child suffer and hence felt guilty about the birth and presence of the child, hence about having sex with the older professor. 2- The fact that they were making love when the child ""committed suicide"" makes her responsible at first (""it's my fault"" she says at the beginning) and her guilt getting bigger she will shift this guilt from her to him who forced her to have sex when the child was in danger. 3- Her desire to have rough sex, even hurtful sex at the end shows that she considers sex coming from him is and has to be a violent process, that she has been forced into it, that she was raped, and that explained how and why she tortured the child. 4- Then she will have to torture him and eventually kill him to alleviate her own guilt, and that will be justice for her since he is the ""bastard.""The whole story is wrapped up in some kind of myth. The myth of the three beggars, represented by a fox, a deer (that has to be a doe) and a bird of prey. When the three beggars come together someone has to die. She tells him about the myth. And in his own torture (she has screwed up a sharpening stone into his left leg to prevent him from escaping and also with a very obvious sexual innuendo: to sterilize him, to make him impotent without castrating him) he sees visions and he finally sees her lying with the fox, the deer and the bird of prey, and he knows she will kill him. So by some miraculous turn of the screw in the story he recuperates the wrench she had hidden under the cabin (suspend you disbelief one minute) and in spite of her trying to stop him he manages to get the sharpening stone off his leg and he strangles her, then burns the body (to prevent her being scavenged by animals of prey, shall we say). His escape becomes a futuristic vision that has little value: the myth of the resurrection of the hundreds if not thousands of dead bodies buried in the forest and they come from behind him alive and rejuvenated and overtake him and we can then wonder if he is still alive or if he has joined the resuscitated crowd, whose resurrection was called by the killing of the curse of the three beggars. The film though is a tragedy brought by some insidious torturing of a child by his own mother, and then by the absolutely absurd and unprofessional decision of the father and husband to take over the psychological treatment of his wife himself, which is totally forbidden by all codes of behavior and action in the psychiatric profession. Lars von Trier decision to make his characters make these mistakes is of course the fruit of his own twisted mind that tortures his characters probably because he does not have the courage to do it for real in his own life. The film must have a cathartic dimension for him. But the film has not cathartic dimension for the audience because we would never, for those who are doctors in a way or another, do this mistake. It becomes then a warning, a road sign saying: ""ROAD TO HELL"" and you better know you must not take it.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Antichrist
30,filipemanuelneto,"Intense, violent but sometimes poetic and challenging... not for any audience.",8,5 December 2017,"When I first started watching this movie I thought it would be just another horror junk but I was wrong. It's one of the most painful movies that I've seen in my entire life. Its not properly horror because it doesn't frighten us, despite having shocking and graphic scenes, but it also takes us totally out of our comfort zone. Its not pornographic, although making use of strong sex scenes and the camera, sometimes, do some frontal shots of the actor's genitalia. What is it then? I don't know, perhaps a mixture of everything, wrapped in lots of philosophy and tied with religion strings.The film is separated into chapters (Preface, Grief, Pain - Chaos Reigns, Despair - Gynocide and Epilogue) and essentially addresses the process of madness of a mother after the death of her child. None of the characters have a name. They are what they are. Its possible that the Wife feels guilty: there is a moment when it seems that she understands what will happen to her son but chooses not to interrupt intercourse. The film uses mourning to address issues such as fear (and the way we face it), pain, anxiety and shock. At one point, Husband, who is a psychologist, decides to take the Wife to a forest that he knows frightens her, to show her that even our worst fears can be beaten. But in the middle of that hostile environment, Wife will conclude that Evil is a part of the Nature and manifests specially in women, so Nature ends up being the Antichrist and Woman ends up being a vehicle for Evil. There's a lot of philosophy and religion implicit in this part of the movie, and so it takes a bit of brain to figure it all out. I will not say how it ends or what happens next, but I think its wise to warn you that there are real shocking scenes, particularly for the women in the audience. In fact, many critics accused Lars Von Trier of being misogynist here.Although the script can be shocking and even sadistic sometimes, the film presents itself as a work of art. Cinematography is perfect, with a very elaborate color and light, a great care in the details, great visual effects and a wise use of blur and black and white. The prologue is full of sad poetry, and we see everything happening to the sound of the famous aria ""Lascia ch'io pianga"", from the Handel's opera ""Rinaldo"" (one of the most beautiful arias of baroque opera). The end repeats this formula. Sound effects are excellent, and the idea of ​​using acorns falling on the roof as a sound effect to amplify dramatic tension was truly brilliant.There's still time to talk about the actors. We almost only have the two mains characters, starring Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsburg. Both were fully up to the challenge, particularly her, with a performance that was intense, painful and insane. I really don't know to what extent such a dramatic exercise could affect me psychologically, but I'm not a professional actor. She really deserved the award for Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival, and it was really sad that Hollywood Academy didn't valued this film.This film, according to what I read, is the first of the ""Depression Trilogy"", as Von Trier was healing from a depression while filming, so his mental state may have had weight in scriptwriting. I don't agree with some critics who said that this movie is full of gore. There's more gore in ""Hostel"" or any movie in the ""Saw"" franchise than here. The problem is that the few gore here can shock us three times more because it makes more sense and we almost feel the pain and despair of the characters.Personally I enjoyed this film, I was quite surprised. It was my first contact with Lars Von Trier's work and I will certainly look for his other films, but I understand who didn't like it. Even my mother would hate this movie, and I can understand why. It's not a movie up for anyone or any audience. You have to be prepared.",Antichrist
31,Rectangular_businessman,A huge disappointment,4,22 July 2012,"Some time ago, I used to be a Lars Von Trier fan.I remember being highly impressed by some of his work, such as ""Europa"", ""Riget"", ""The Elements of Crime"" and ""Dancer in The Dark"". Also, ""Dogville"" and ""Manderlay"", despite being both very pretentious movies, had many interesting elements.Then I saw ""Epidemic"", ""The Idiots"" and ""The Boss of it All"" and I start to consider that maybe Lars von Trier wasn't the infallible director that I thought. Sure, all those movies that I mention, have at least, one remarkable quality, but none of them were entirely satisfying, feeling pretty much as self-indulgent works with many good ideas on them but lacking of any kind of satisfying development. The same happens here.""Antichrist"" is visually stunning from beginning to end (The opening sequence is one of the most beautiful sequences that I've seen in any movie from the recent years) but it left me feeling empty, as if I saw some one of those art house films that are pretty to look at, but which are easy to forget.The premise of this movie is very interesting and promising (In fact, this was one of my most anticipated films from the year 2009) but the truth is that when I saw it I thought that it doesn't live up the hype and controversy that was created around it. Sure, it does have some brief scenes of graphic violence, but the story itself was something vapid, that didn't had very much effect on me. The whole movie felt pretty much as only the prelude of a much more better story that never happens, creating too many expectations without fulfilling any single one of them.Even if ""Antichrist"" has indeed many virtues, it is also a deeply flawed work which I consider to be one of the most disappointing movie- watching experiences that I had in the recent times. Well, at least it was better than ""Melancholia"".",Antichrist

35,videorama-759-859391,"Oh Christ, a film more visually fascinating then arousing or plot filled",4,24 January 2014,"Here's another push the envelope of classification film. A horrible tragedy, with some sick graphic violence hidden behind it, as if to make it justified, one particular scene we could of done without. And when each viewing, I almost want to shirk it. If without morbid fascination, this is an arty and very violent visual tale, which as a piece of controversy earns it's place along Salo, Baise Moi. It's no surprise, brazen actor Dafoe, who's not scared to go buff, stars in this, as in a few other R rated pics prior. (I can run down a list) The film starts off beautifully, played against an encompassing piece of opera, church music, that sets the tone beautifully. Dafoe and Gainsborough are making love, oblivious to the fact their infant is crawling towards an open window. Then's there's the funeral, and the retreat in the hills where Dafoe, has to slowly and compassionately nurse his fragilely distraught wife, with an over excess of guilt, like him, out of this slump and slowly get over this unbearable loss. And as the movie progresses, through a couple of more sexual moments, Gainsborough slowly loses it, her mind tipping into that of some crazy murderous madwoman, though I really found it hard to understand why she becomes like she does. My analogy, is that she truly just couldn't get over it, and never would, where guilt was eating at her. So she has blocked this out, but that chosen path has backfired on her, or she's assumed this murderous soul, initially instigated by the guilt. The end scene with all the trees, where all these souls suddenly appear was visually fascinating as other parts of the film were, but what it boils down to, is that this is just a shock piece, hidden behind a small plot of story, with an excuse for our two well played stars to get naked. Be warned, with hiring this one.",Antichrist
36,Chris Knipp,Authentic horror? Stunner from Lars,9,23 September 2009,"It's been said (and he confirms) that the Danish cinematic provocateur and master always makes essentially the same film, but Von Trier's Antichrist differs from the others in various ways. It has only two characters, a husband (Willem Dafoe) and wife (Charlotte Gainsbourg). As he tells it, 'Antichrist' was his way of finding out, in the wake of the first severe depression of his life, whether he even had the strength to make another film. If he had less control than usual, he counted himself lucky to be able to work. And he was pleased with the result, which he declares to be more instinctive and less calculated than previous efforts. Another new thing is that the cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle has a glossy, non-Dogme look. And the whole film reads, partly anyway, as coming from a new genre he hasn't played with before: it's a very arty -- psychological and philosophical -- horror movie.The title ""came early,"" but what it means other than to allude to the fact that von Trier does not believe in God, is uncertain; he insists that Nietzsche's 'Antichrist' has been on his bedside table for 40 years but he has never read it. He points rather to his debt to Strindberg, whose combative couples fascinated him early on. And this is a combative couple, that's for sure.Also unusual is a Prologue in black and white and slow motion accompanied by a baroque aria, Handel's ""Lascio ch'io pianga"" (""Let me weep""), during which the couple has sex. Their little boy, Nic, escapes from his crib, opens the door and sees them making love, then walks over to a window and falls out and is killed. Four chapters follow, Grief, Pain (Chaos Reigns), Despair (Gynocide), and The Three Beggars; then an Epilogue. The action takes place in the Pacific Northwest (though it was shot in Europe).Much of the story is about dominance and submission. The man is a psychotherapist. His wife collapses at the funeral and is hospitalized and sleeps for a long time. The man can't accept the doctor's methods, his use of medications, and insists, against professional principles, on treating his own wife. He takes her through a series of ""treatments"" that von Trier may think of as forms of ""cognitive therapy,"" but the methodology is fanciful and erratic. At her urging they resort to sex to ease her suffering, which he thinks a bad idea.Her grief continues, but turns to fear. He persuades her to pinpoint her fear, and its locus seems to be the outdoor, grassy part of a summer cottage in the woods that they call ""Eden"" where in the year before she was with Nic working alone on a thesis about gynocide, a history of the oppression and killing of women.In a discussion of this, she tells him she had started to see that women, while wronged by men, contain evil themselves, because they contain nature, and nature embodies evil. The Pain, Despair, and Three Beggars chapters take place out in the woods, where the husband takes his wife, ostensibly to work out her fear and overcome it, in a highly symbolic, beautiful, and terrifying nature in which birthing deer, ravens, a fox, hail, and falling acorns menace and signify. ""Nature is Satan's church"" is a line the wife speaks, and in some sense the Pacific woods become von Triers' sexual Purgatory and Inferno. Early in the approach to the woods there is a particularly haunting and scary distant shot in extreme slow motion in which the woman is seen crossing a little bridge onto the property where the cabin is, a place that terrifies her.Despite his persistent voice of reason, it's clear that the husband is something of a sadist and a fool; she says at one point that he was never really interested in her till now, as a patient, and object to toy with. Again they resort to sex as a grim palliative. Eventually she rebels, and takes extreme measures against both her husband and herself. This is where the film swerves toward horror and gore and the masturbation and mutilation that led to boos and walkouts at Cannes. But there were no boos at all and scant walkouts at the Lincoln Center NYFF press and industry screening I watched.This isn't a film I'm eager to watch again right now but it is perhaps his most beautiful, and one of his strongest, provocations. Obviously there are themes of sexuality, gender roles, dominance and submission, and nature. The apparent (and largely convincing) narrative sequence is partly a ruse. The slo-mo prologue introduces the Primal Scene, but the guilt is the couple's. And the guilt extends to unease about sex itself. The wife assumes it as hers, but may eventually shift the blame to her husband. The child's death may be a pretext for introducing the theme of melancholy, the emotion the director himself was working out of. The action in the woods may seem to result from the husband-therapist's efforts to ""cure"" his wife of her grief and fear, but turns into an enactment of more primal and inexplicable fears and horrors. In a Q&A conducted long distance via Skype (Lars hates flying; anyway avoids coming to the US) the director seemed extremely candid; but can one really believe him? and also sometimes wicked and playful. He is justifiably grateful to Gainsbourg and Dafoe, who do excellent work. Interestingly, he said the slickness of the images wasn't quite what he had wanted -- the dialogue scenes in particular he'd wanted to have more a ""documentary"" look to distinguish them from the more symbolic animal and nature scenes -- and he's somewhat apologetic about taking the old device of slow motion photography from the ""toy box,"" but he typically pretested that he was just glad he'd been able to make a film. And so should we be.Seen at the New York Film Festival.",Antichrist
37,billcr12,Lars skewed vision,3,26 June 2012,"Another pretentious piece of nonsense from Lars Von Trier. If you have always wished to see a baby boy climb through a window and plunge several stories to his death, in slow motion, while Handel plays in the background, maybe this one's for you. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that mommy and daddy are having a vigorous sexual encounter when junior goes splat on the sidewalk, while the snow falls majestically to the ground; such poetry in motion. Sex, death, guilt; it is all here. Mom(Charlotte Gainsbourg) is unable to deal with the her grief and collapses at the funeral. Later, in a hospital and under heavy medication, she does not improve. Dad(Willem Dafoe) is a therapist who believes that he can cure her with nature therapy at a cabin in the woods named Eden(as in garden of, I suppose).At the cabin, after seeing a deer which is not afraid of them, acorns hit the roof with such intensity, that it sounds like gun shots. Do they leave? Of course not, they are masochists. He encounters a talking fox, which says, chaos reigns. He finds a scrapbook from his wife's thesis on witch trials, and reads her idea that all women are evil. When he confronts her, she asks him to hit her during sex. They get it on next to a large tree, and hands come up through the roots. Afterwords, she tortures him severely, drilling a hole through his leg, and attaching a metal piece to a chain. She leaves and he drags himself outside and hides in a fox hole. She finds him and whacks him with a shovel. Hours later, she apologizes and asks him to kill her. Using scissors to pleasure herself, blood flows and more hail hits the roof.

38,Polaris_DiB,A lot of words for a very simple reaction,5,4 February 2010,"Von Trier's confrontational nature is a real boon for both his film-making talent and his movies' reception, and people are almost driven to see his movies based on the sheer audacity of his style and almost desperate to find meaning in the way he breaks the boundaries of film sensibilities. His early promotion of Dogme 95, his clear anti-American sentiments, and his near refusal to go anywhere over water gives him an alternative celebrity that creates an almost necessary love-him-or-hate-him reception across the world. None of that matters to me. When I see his movies, I cannot help but take them at face value.Antichrist has possibly gotten more press than it's gotten viewers, as every critic has their own way of being taken aback by the content of it. Thus far it seems everybody is willing to talk about it but few responses are consistent, thus why audiences are continually drawn into the debate. The argument still survives that he must be doing something right to continue to compel people.The problem is, Lars Von Trier shoots like a formalist without actually being one. He purposefully and knowingly discards traditional narrative storytelling, but unlike other people who do so with a specific overall purpose in mind, Von Trier's movies do so to reflect his general confrontational behavior. Every movie of his dares you to question why he's doing it the way he is, and if you fall for the bait, it's your problem. What does he mean by setting a Satanic gynocidal spiritual witch-hunt story in a place called Eden and having people crawl into Freudian metaphors in the middle of the woods? Just that and nothing more. Why does he break the 180 degree rule in the hospital room? Because he felt like it. Why does he include graphic violence and genital mutilation? Because he's willing & able to. Charlotte Gainsborough and Willem Dafoe are husband and wife who, in the act of coitus, fail (initially, later reversed) to notice their kid falling to his death. Grief-stricken, Dafoe decides to become Gainsborough's personal therapist and, though already breaching boundaries of both therapy and marriage in such a situation, still tries to maintain therapeutic ethics by refusing to sleep with her (?). After trying to discover the root of her anxiety and fear, he takes her to Eden where she breaks down mentally and he loses control over his patient, mostly because he's in Nature and that's bad symbolic mojo. This leads to the famous and enticing third act which breaks previously established graphic boundaries and really traps the audience in a cloistering relationship.So close but so far. Something about 2009--directors had all these good ideas and then threw them away because they needed to maintain their image. Tarantino had this incredibly powerful story about a vengeful young Jewish woman in Nazi-occupied France foiled against a sinister badguy, which he threw away with exploitation music and quirky logorrheaic characters. Von Trier has this story about a husband crossing professional and marital boundaries and dealing with the horrific consequences of it, and throws it away by going Puritanical on our asses and joining a bit of hypersymbolic Hawthorne to his repertoire, except on the wrong coast. There is something to be said about auteurship and the freedom to do what you want, but talk about missed opportunities. What we have instead is a rather splintery domestic build-up leading to a roundly horrific conclusion, in a method that leads to some small gems but mostly pops in and out of stylistic consciousness.Thus: the prologue and epilogue are useless and shouldn't exist (the absence of the information given by the prologue would have created a much stronger narrative ambiguity as the audience would not automatically have information catharsis based on what they saw and how they then attribute it to the characters motivations; the epilogue doesn't add to it). It is clear what Von Trier is doing in each scene, but he isn't concerned with consistency and flow, so some work and some don't. And then at the end, when everything the audience is there for takes place, you discover a very unique twist on the modern ultra-violent slasher that is honestly some of the best work Von Trier has done. And, if I may say so--hilarious. At least, I was laughing. I don't really know what other people were thinking, but somehow they didn't find the pounding-the-raven scene to be the slapstick comedy fest I perceived it to be. Whatever, some people just don't have a sense of humor.I loved what Von Trier did with lens distortion, I didn't care much for the black and white. I loved the scene where Willem Dafoe forces Charlotte Gainsborough to cross the grass, I didn't care much for the mutilated animals. One of the reasons why I think critics and reviewers have been so ambivalent about this movie is because they are trying hard to synthesize the experience into one entire whole, with some concluding some massively meaningful statements about stuff to other people deciding that Von Trier is a misogynist, whereas as I said before, I have a hard time taking Von Trier at anything other than face value. Oh, they're in Eden? Okay, they're in Eden. ""Freud is dead now, right""? Okay, he's deconstructing Freud. Charlotte Gainsborough's going postal on her husband? Great. Her husband is an unaware abuser? Fine with me. Their son represents their unholy and unstable union within her post-partum depression and post-mortem grief? Fair enough. What's there to discuss? Who is the real Satanic one in this situation? Eh, any one of them. Why aren't we focusing more on the central relationship with so much more power and meaning to it? Oh yeah, because we need a talking fox sequence. Gotcha.Sorry for the lengthy post: ""Meh, it was kinda BS but a lot of fun"" is just not good enough in some situations. --PolarisDiB",Antichrist
39,dfranzen70,von Trier at his finest,8,12 October 2014,"I wouldn't say that Lars von Trier's Antichrist is hard to watch, but early on there's some porn-level graphic sex and later on there's genital mutilation. This just means that this film, like most of von Trier's movies, is an acquired taste. Nothing, it seems, is verboten. It's not really for the faint of heart.An anonymous couple, played by Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg, suffer the loss of their toddler, who's fallen out a window a few stories up. Each grieves in his own manner, with the woman leaning on drugs prescribed by a psychiatrist and the man holding it all in. Finally, they head to a lakeside cabin, just the two of them, in order to best work through their pain. And then things get weird.It's not a standard horror film, despite the remote setting, but it's explicitly violent. von Trier received quite a bit of criticism for his perceived misogyny displayed here, but I've come to believe that the film is more misanthropic than anything else. There's a subplot moving within the story's firmament about women from centuries past who were believed to be actual witches, but the connection to the woman is teased out to us. In the end, that subplot behaves as filler that ambiguously explains the cause of the previous 90 minutes of carnage.Some scenes demand close attention. The man's earnest attention to his wife's troubles seem to hide his own panic and terror. He tries valiantly to guide his wife back to sanity, but he's in over his head. There's something about their cabin, too; named Eden, it seems to be both the source of and the answer to all of their problems. Perhaps because something intense happened there the previous summer when the woman visited with the couple's son.It's safe to say that Antichrist is a gruesome mind trip. There's deep symbolism afoot, sometimes with subtlety in the form of woodland creatures and other times a lot more bluntly, as in blunt instrument. A psychological horror film, Antichrist is a fine road-not-taken, sublime horror.",Antichrist

41,parry_na,Intense but one-note ...,5,9 February 2018,"Lars von Trier's unofficially titled 'depression trilogy' of films begins with this, continues with 'Melancholia (2011)' and concludes with the mammoth and quite excellent 'Nymphomaniac (2013)'. 'Antichrist' isn't easy viewing.Rutting like animals, He (Williem Defoe) and She (Charlotte Gainsbourg) fail to notice their toddler son Nic climb onto the open window ledge and fall from the balcony to his death. Subsequently, understandably consumed by grief, the couple hike to an isolated cabin in Eden woods, far from anywhere. The husband is a therapist and feels he can manage his wife's at times uncontrollable misery.What follows is their story in four chapters, each one highlighting different levels of their 'journey'. This often involves manic sex and masturbation in a bid to escape the pain of sadness, woodland animals in throes of death and various scenes of discomfort (graphically shown), the disembodied cries of a child (possibly Nic), violence, and ultimately terror.I found this a good deal less engaging than the substantially longer 'Nymphomaniac', and approach the final film in the trilogy with an open mind. The story begins on one level of graphic imagery and despair, and remains at that level throughout. There is no real let-up or drifting away from the overwhelming intensity of it all - which becomes less intense because of its ubiquity. Defoe and Gainsbourg are excellent throughout - you really get the impression actors suffered in the creation of these roles. Director Frier has said that 'the film was finished without much enthusiasm' due to his fragile mental state at the time, and while the acting betrays no such lack of commitment, the overall effect sadly in accordance with Frier. I should add, the direction here is magical, if perhaps a little heavy-handed.",Antichrist
42,Chris_Docker,Embedded horror,8,23 June 2009,"Where does horror reside in the psyche? Lars von Trier has established himself as a maker of serious, avant-garde drama. He came to fame through Breaking the Waves, a controversial story of how far someone would go for love. He founded the Dogme movement of verite cinema, and made The Idiots, where lunacy and sanity are cleverly mixed. Next came Dancer in the Dark, an almost Janacek-like musical where a blind girl takes inner fantasy to extremes. There were experiments like The Five Obstructions, and two highly theatrical Brechtian pieces called Dogville and Manderlay, with chalklines instead of sets. One of the few uncontroversial films he has made is Boss of it All, an extremely clever comedy that didn't receive much attention.If someone like von Trier makes a horror movie, it is hardly likely to be standard fare. He makes films that provide himself and his audiences with thorny intellectual challenges. This results both in adherents and those which dismiss his work as pretentious. (Inasmuch as this review is partly interpretative, other viewers may find their own preferred readings which differ from the approach given here.) With Antichrist, although there are standard 'fright' moments, the main horror is deep psychological manipulation that stays with you for days afterwards. Instead of lashings of gore that can retrospectively be dismissed as 'more CGI,' von Trier seems to do exactly the opposite of what a Freudian psychotherapist would do in releasing obsessions. He locks the terrifying nature of the horror to the most extreme sexual images. The narrative itself follows a similar process. A psychotherapist, with the best intentions, leads his wife into the darkest recesses of her mind. But instead of releasing psychological trauma, he reinforces it, until he has to defend himself when she becomes the controlling force.A psychotherapist (Willem Dafoe) and his wife (Charlotte Gainsbourg) are making love as their young toddler climbs onto a desk to look at snowflakes outside. And falls to his death. This opening prologue is operatic in its soundtrack and intensity. Exquisite monochrome photography captures water droplets in slow motion to Handel. There is a very brief, aesthetically contextualised glimpse of penetration, setting the audience up for the psycho-sexual horrors that follow later. In the trauma of bereavement, He asks his wife to visualise her worst nightmares in order to help her overcome them. She pictures the woods as symbolising her fear, and they both retreat to an 'Eden' – an isolated cabin surrounded by woods.The film is divided into six parts, including a Prologue (the lovemaking and death), Grief, Pain, and Despair; The Three Beggars, and an Epilogue. At the end of the prologue, the next three chapters are heralded by three toy soldiers from the dead son's toyroom, each appropriately named.With Grief, comes very palpable sorrow from both leads. The players become substantial rather than dramatis personae. Colour is added to the previously monochrome palette, literally and in terms of filling out their characters.As we go through Pain, his wife seems eventually cured. Our nerves, however, are frayed. This is compounded by the rhythmic, hypnotic pounding of acorns falling on the roof of the cabin, and his irritating but inescapable smugness as he treats his wife as a patient rather than a human being needing support. He forever has a self-satisfied, smart answer. Retreating to her own area of expertise, she comes out with ever more unanswerable metaphors, including, ""Nature is Satan's Church."" (She had been working previously on a book about 'Gynocide' and witch-hunts). The chapter finally introduces openly surreal elements, when a fox is unearthed. (The cunningness of foxes suggests a reliance on logic, whereas the subconscious can rely more on symbols, introducing chaos to a 'logical world.') Chapter three is entitled Despair (Gynocide). He learns things about his wife he didn't know before but perhaps should have. He is pulled into her nightmare. We see him soaked in the rain, at the mercy – for the first time – of the elements. The fourth chapter gives form to the imaginary content of the preceding three, and includes the most upsetting and outrageous scenes (which some viewers will find objectionable). The epilogue provides a narrative and psychological resolution in the only way possible when things have come to such a head. We also see the story relate now to the whole of humanity.The title of the film contains far more than is at first apparent, although there is also some weakness for the film there. In ancient (pre-'Christian') mythology, the 'Christos' was the enlightened soul within, a central experience of the Gnostic 'heretics.' Their pure aspiration enflamed prayer to reach this exalted realisation. The danger, of course, was that they would mistake an experience along the way for the 'ultimate truth' and become 'obsessed.' This also relates to why so many mystics and spiritual seekers form their own sects. From a Roman Catholic viewpoint, it might be used to explain many different churches that fall short of the ultimate authority. Von Trier is a lapsed Catholic, and describes himself as increasingly atheist. He has said he keeps a copy of Nietzsche's Antichrist at his bedside. In Nietzschean terms, any (traditional) religious conviction is an obsession that falls short of ultimate truth. In New Testament orthodoxy, an Antichrist is what (or who) precedes the Second Coming. Obsession as a temptation along the way works in all mythologies. Psychologically, this is simple description of a process in the mind. But von Trier's use of Christian symbols complicates the issue and obfuscates an elaborate tragedy that is already nearly Shakespearean in its format.Antichrist is sure to get reactions, even from audiences not geared to his work. For them, the extreme and graphic sexual imagery may be a psychological device too far. For others, among whom are a rare breed of horror aficionados that enjoy a challenge while being outraged and violated, it is a gem of inestimable value.",Antichrist
43,jimbo-53-186511,"Bizarre, Inaccessible & Boring",1,24 May 2015,"Husband & therapist Willem Dafoe does his best to try to counsel his wife Charlotte Gainsbourg following the death of their child.The start of the film seemed to tell a story about the conception of the couples child and then the untimely death of their child. It's a little strange, but quite emotive and the operatic soundtrack does help to enhance this effect. Sadly this film pretty much falls apart after the first 5 minutes...Despite its 'controversial' tag The Antichrist is a surprisingly lifeless affair for the most part with Dafoe's therapy sessions being nothing but dreary chatter with the odd bit of rumpy-pumpy being thrown in now and again (presumably to try to prevent the audience from nodding off). The narrative is also pretty inaccessible and I struggled to see how much of it related to helping Dafoe's wife grieving for their child. Von Trier throws in random supposed 'symbolism' that was meaningless and completely lost on me. There are also random flashbacks here and there which again add nothing to the film. The film also suffers from cheap production values and looks more like a documentary than anything else - the camera work was inconsistent whereby there are occasions when it's OK, but then other times when it looks like someone with the DT's has got hold of the camera.In the final third of the film it goes from being boring and inaccessible to just downright bizarre. Von Trier shows us he's blood thirsty and the final act is more torture porn than anything else. This would be fine if there was any substance to go with it, but there wasn't from where I was sitting. Then there's the Three Beggars element at the end; what the hell was that all about? Given the fact that this film only has two characters in the film for the full running time, would it have hurt to make at least one of them likable? The only real positive about this film lies with the Cinematography which did give the film a bleak feel about it and at least made it feel slightly atmospheric, but that's the only good thing I can say about this film.So to sum it up then The Antichrist is basically consists of the first two thirds of the film being boring and inaccessible and then the final third of the film is just torture porn. It's ironic really that Antichrist is dialogue heavy and yet has so little to say. Normally if a narrative seems inaccessible I'd consider watching the film again, but to sit through this again would be far more torturous than anything that happened to either Dafoe or Gainsbourg in this film.",Antichrist

The lady becomes distraught and disturbed and her husband decides to cure her by taking her to a cabin of woods where the situation worsens.The movie is very slow disturbing and violent. The director is successful in making the movie such a violent and gruesome that the people with week heart can actually slips in depression.The acting by both the characters is great specially by Charlotte Gainsbourgh.The movie should be watched only if you can see a violent and gruesome movie which is very dark and disturbing.,Antichrist
45,EVOL666,Solid Art-Film...Not Nearly As 'Shocking' As It Had Been Made Out...,8,9 February 2010,"I originally hunted down a copy of ANTICHRIST because I too had heard the rumor of it being 'shocking' and extremely 'graphic'-and that's the sort of thing I love to hear when searching out films. What I got instead was an interesting, artfully shot film that other than a few short scenes-wasn't nearly as 'shocking' as the hype surrounding it would have suggested. The story revolves around a couple whose young son dies tragically while the parents are f!cking. The shock and guilt of the child's death causes the mother to suffer from severe depression-to the point of near-madness. The couple decide to take some time off and spend some time at a secluded cabin where the husband, a shrink, tries to 'rehabilitate' his wife. This doesn't work out as planned and the wife descends into full-scale insanity...ANTICHRIST is definitely the type of film that will divide viewers. It's relatively slow- paced and there's a lot of symbolism throughout that can prove a bit confusing. Those who don't dig 'art-films' could definitely have a hard time with this one. Also-if you seek out this film looking for some sort of grotesque and graphic horror film-I assume you'll be sadly disappointed. Luckily I didn't really know anything about ANTICHRIST before my viewing (other than the fact that it was rumored to have a few 'hard' scenes), so I was able to enjoy it on my own terms. Stylistically I found it to be quite good, and it's filmed beautifully. As far as the actual content of the film-I basically chose to enjoy it strictly on the level of a woman's descent into madness after suffering a horrible shock. I understand that there were many other sub-texts relating to things like witchcraft and whatnot-but since I found those elements to hinder what otherwise seemed to be a pretty straight-forward plot-I just chose to ignore them. I'm sure some will feel that I missed the point of the film by ignoring these points-but I think that personally I would have enjoyed it far less had I tried to dwell too much on some of these aspects. To address the 'graphic' content: yes-there is one short 'hardcore' sex scene and a couple scenes of violence/mutilation that may bother more sensitive viewers. But any hardcore horror-fan will be hard pressed to consider anything shown in the film all that 'shocking'. Overall, I enjoyed ANTICHRIST-even if I may have missed out on some of the finer points-but I don't know if I'd necessarily recommend it to most casual film-viewers. Worth a look if you can tolerate a well-made and interesting 'art-film'-if not-you may as well leave this one alone...8/10",Antichrist

47,I_Ailurophile,A forceful lesson in the dark arts,6,29 January 2021,"There was a time when I specifically sought out movies to watch that were controversial, or renowned for eliciting revulsion from the audience, or that infamously have scenes regarded as grotesque. In that spirit, here's 'Antichrist.'What caught my attention was an old blurb about viewers angrily walking out on a festival showing, and additional reports of audience members vomiting. While I didn't have any such reaction, I can't blame anyone who does: graphic, explicit sex is only the appetizer for a movie that also features very - VERY - personal violence. This is not a film for the faint of heart.The plot is minimal, serving as baseline exposition for the characters' journey. The meat of 'Antichrist' is in an examination of good and evil, human nature, and the twisted knot where love, grief, pain, and violence intersect. Or at least, that's what it's supposed to be: 'Antichrist' aims to view these things through the lens of its own violence, but the lens is a bit smudged. Such subtleties are difficult to meaningfully perceive amidst violence that I think review guidelines prohibit me from describing.So it is, too, with stars Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg. They both put in fine performances? I think? The thing about crafting a film as visceral as 'Antichrist' is that the visual content rather overwhelms the artistry behind it. Imagine if A-listers starred in a dime-a-dozen gorefest of a horror flick as it tried to convey some very philosophical and artistic ponderings. The meaning would quite be lost amidst the brutality, and though to a lesser extent, the same is kind of true here. Still, as others have remarked, there's no doubting how grueling the filming must have been on an emotional level, so by all means, hats off to the stars.All that having been said, I don't think 'Antichrist' is a bad movie. I just don't think it does the things it wants to do as successfully as it thinks it does. It wants its violence to be a vehicle for deep thoughts, but it's so forceful and intense in its depictions that the deep thoughts end up seeming more to become a vehicle for the violence. It's certainly unforgettable, I'll say that much.Is it worth watching? I don't regret watching it, for my part, but I also don't intend to ever watch it again. And I'm hard-pressed to think of any reason why 'Antichrist' would ever come up in conversation, let alone why I might recommend it to someone, apart from ""Hey, do you want to see something really messed up?"" Maybe I just don't ""get"" films like this, but take that as you will.Chaos reigns.",Antichrist
48,Enchorde,This must be what madness looks like...,5,6 February 2011,"This must be what madness looks like if made into a movie. That shouldn't automatically be taken as a bad. Because Antichrist isn't bad. On the other hand, I wouldn't describe it as good either. Antichrist is best described as interesting. Well, gruesome, explicit and violent would do as well.The movie is about the aftereffects of a terrible event. A couple loses their only child to a terrible accident. Naturally they are struck by grief that make them loose their footing. Their relationship is rocked by its foundation, and they can't be sure what's real or not. To heal and find their way back they leave the city for their cabin in the forest. But in the forest lies evil, or is it their own minds?Antichrist is a real dark movie, both in literal color and theme. It is gruesomely violent, sometimes actually hard to watch as it made my stomach turn. But it should never be confused with an action, because it is definitely not. The tempo is slow and the violent scenes are more disgusting and explicit than entertaining. There is quite a lot of nudity and sex too, mostly desperate and not very beautiful. But this is definitely not a movie for any kids, or if you are sensitive in any way.But it is skillfully made. It plays skillfully with color and some slow motion effects. It is detailed, sometimes painfully so, and the script and direction really works together. It is this that makes Antichrist worth to see. It is the craftsmanship of von Trier, Dafoe and Gainsborough that is the benefit of the movie.Antichrist will never be confused with a feel good movie though. It is not a movie to see if you want to be entertained. Antichrist is for those who appreciates the craftsmanship of movie making, or find it interesting to explore the dark twists and turns of a grief struck mind.5/10",Antichrist
49,Jonny_Numb,Primal Rage,8,20 December 2010,"One of the many impish tricks of ""Antichrist"" is how writer-director Lars von Trier grounds the film in modern psychological dogma, but keeps us purposely locked outside of the characters undergoing these very intricate (yet very subjective) psychoses. Further complicating matters is a deliberate disconnect between protagonist and antagonist -- while a more conventional horror film would jump at the opportunity to make a therapist husband (Willem Dafoe) -- full of textbook knowledge on manipulating patients into desired states of rationality and self-actualization -- the shrewd villain toward his grief-stricken wife (Charlotte Gainsbourg), Trier underlines the detachment between individuals brought about by a shared tragedy (the death of a child). To aid his despondent wife in overcoming her pervasive grief, Dafoe takes her to an isolated cabin deep in the woods, where the natural life surrounding them begins to take on a life of its own...a life informed, perhaps, by Gainsbourg's own damaged psyche. In a possible dream sequence, a deformed fox informs Dafoe that ""chaos reigns."" Like the best works of David Lynch (particularly ""Eraserhead""), ""Antichrist"" paints a portrait in symbols and abstract (and sometimes cringingly gruesome) displays of physical and mental anguish; there is a stark rawness and ambiguity to the proceedings that transcends art-house pretension as it plumbs the darkness of the human soul.7.5 out of 10",Antichrist
50,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Brutal Look at Loss and Grief,9,9 June 2019,"This was a film that I randomly checked out when I was working through Fangoria's top 300 horror films of all time. I didn't know much coming into it, but I had seen couple of the writer/director's other films, Melancholia and Dogville. I knew from those films that this would look amazing and probably have some brutal realism. I'm updating my review after my third viewing, where I saw this in the theater as part of its Horror 101 series. The synopsis is a grieving couple retreat to their cabin in the woods, hoping to repair their broken hearts and troubled marriage, but nature takes its course and things go from bad to worse.We start off with the prologue as this film is broken into five parts. We meet our two main characters, He (Willem Dafoe) and his wife, She (Charlotte Gainsbourg). They are making love in the shower and then take it to their bed. We see that they have a son, played by Nic (Storm Acheche Sahlstrøm). They do not hear that he is awake and do not see him as he climbs up to a window sill and falls out.We then shift to them leaving the funeral. She collapses as they do. He visits her in the hospital and we learn that he is a psychologist. He feels that her doctor is an idiot and doesn't like the idea of her taking the medication she is given. He is not supposed to treat his family, but he's arrogant though and thinks he knows what's best for her.He pushes her to get rid of her pills, which she flushes down the toilet. He also pushes to help her through her grief. He wants her to deal with it, not to dull her senses with medication. He does learn that she was writing her thesis and was doing it out in a cabin they own in the woods. While doing this, He learns that she is scared of the woods and calls the place Eden.He is awoken in the middle of the night as Gainsbourg is banging her head on the toilet bowl. He stops her and it is then decided that they are going to go to the cabin. While on the way, he does an exercise that shows us important landmarks out to the cabin. He does get her to realize some of her fears before they get out there.It doesn't work at first. She panics on the bridge, needs to rest before they get to the cabin. While she takes a nap, He looks around and finds a deer; the problem though is the deer has a stillborn baby still hanging out from inside her. It runs away.They finally make it there. We learn more and more about this couple while here. He begins to lose it a little bit. The first thing that happens with him is that acorns fall from the tree above the cabin. It sounds like hail falling and it keeps him awake. The next morning he wakes up with his window open and his hand is covered in something that sticks to his skin. He freaks out trying to pull them off.He continues to question her to learn more and more about what scares her. It turns out that she is scared of nature, but that is really him that is scared of the nature around him. She is more scared of nature of humans. She thinks that she has overcome her issues, but we see that the isolation might have gotten to her the last time she was here and that it might be happening again.After this viewing, I do think that I understand it a bit more than with previous ones. This one actually has a quite interesting story behind it. The grief of losing their child is hurting them in different ways. It also is driving a wedge between them as well. She is taking it hard, she is resenting He because she doesn't think he cares. She thought this in the summer before he passed away that he neglected them. I do believe that it is bothering him, but he is just showing his grief in different ways.There is also the aspect that He is quite arrogant. Despite knowing he shouldn't be treating his wife, he does it any way. I think the idea of the treatment he is trying is good. Instead of dulling the pain with drugs or by doing things to mask the pain, he really wants her to face what she is dealing with. The issue though becomes that going to Eden is not the best course of action for her.The film also has some really good allegories as well and symbolism. This time around I noticed there are three figurines that bear the name of the chapters of Despair, Grief and Pain. Each of these chapters reflects the stage of depression that She is dealing with as well. There is also the thesis that she is working on that is reflected in things that happen to them. Calling the place they go to Eden is ironic in that there man and woman, much like Adam and Eve. There is also talking of the corruption of man with comes back to that story as well.Really the only gripe I have with this film is the length. I do think that von Trier is a bit pretentious in some of things he does. That is not to say that I didn't like this film. I just feel there are some arthouse things done that bog down the film at times. Despite this though, it really builds tension and the climax of the film still makes me cringe every time.To the acting of the film which is absolutely amazing. There are only three credit cast members. Dafoe I thought was great. As I stated, he comes off as so arrogant that he solve his wife's problem. He doesn't realize that being as close to her as he is that he isn't seeing the detriment it is doing to her. Gainsbourg is equally amazing in this film. I can see why von Trier likes working with, as she is in most of his films. Her depiction of grief is heartbreaking and seeing her try to cope, but being unable to explains her descent into madness. She did a phenomenal job. We also get to see her completely nude as well if you were curious. Sahlstrøm was fine in the small parts that he was needed.Next I'll cover the effects of the film, which are brutally great. They were done practically and it still makes me cringe even though I know what is coming. There is genitalia mutilation and there is violence on top of that. It is crazy to say though, it makes sense to the story and is quite artfully done. Von Trier also likes to use vivid colors, matte backgrounds that give the scene a surreal feel as well as using slow motion. It really helps to build that feel the film needed.Something else to help that is the use of the music to build suspense as well as give this film an even creepier feel. There are long stretches of the film that don't have any type of score with it. It really accentuate the feel of the scene when the music is introduced and that is masterfully done.Now with that said, this isn't a film I would recommend to everyone. First is if you like arthouse films, then give this a viewing. If you like von Trier's films, I would say you have to see this one. I have seen a couple films by him and I could tell immediately he made it. I do have to admit that I am a fan. I feel that he does a great job of mixing the drama, psychology and horror together for this one. This film has great acting with a good story. The acting though is really what this film is about and drives it. The editing and the music are also good to help the overall feel. I will warn again that there is graphic violence that had me cringing, so if you can't handle that, I would avoid this. This is just a powerful film dealing with loss and descending into madness.",Antichrist

52,Seraphion,Just plain weird,5,16 May 2015,"This review's title simply states my point of view about this movie, and more so about the whole line of work by Lars von Trier. Having watched the newer works, I feel that this one tops them in terms of story weirdness and the literal absurdity of how a story can flow. The movie presents a story that develops like other tragedy dramas do. Yet after the movie passed half of its duration, it veers into sheer absurd stuff, bordering itself on the thin line between an underdeveloped thriller, a wannabe horror and a plainly absurd nothing-more-to-say B rated script for a movie. What makes me still being generous enough with quite a high score of 5 is the acting overall that looks very good to me. Willem Dafoe's acting is very nice here. He managed to shed his usual antagonistic and menacing aura and replaced it with the caring and somewhat clueless husband role. Charlotte Gainsbourg's acting is also very nice. Her character really kept me watching this quite absurd piece.",Antichrist
53,framptonhollis,the filthiest masterpiece since the days of SALO and PINK FLAMINGOS,9,10 August 2017,"There are some movies out there that are disturbing not only in their content, but also in their genuine quality. Who knew that a film featuring dead babies, self mutilation, and bloody semen could be such a masterpiece? And a surprisingly poetic one at that?! Well, with this brilliant, provocative, and bone chilling experimental film, Lars Von Trier proves that any subject matter and any imagery can be weaved into a great, and objectively flawless (on a technical level) work of art. Trier avoids pretension despite making this film as ""artsy"" as it seems possible, and he is able to do such by creating a clever, shocking story that consumes the viewer in a brilliantly paced, relentlessly explicit manner. While I am praising this film with extreme enthusiasm, it is likely to be too disturbing, twisted, and odd for most moviegoers, so I cannot exactly recommend it like I do many other films I give a perfect score. However, for those that can can handle the grotesque visuals, heavy subject matter, and discomforting style, ""Antichrist"" is a feast for the eyes, mind, and heart-a feast that may seem excessive at times, but nonetheless enthralling. Divisive, controversial, loaded with tons of disgusting sex and violence, Trier proves his immense talent and bravery with this horror masterwork.""Antichrist"" was a movie bound to receive gallons of both hatred and praise from the start, and I do not blame viewers who do not like this movie. It's not for everyone, or most people even, which is part of the reason why I hesitate to recommend it. It isn't just because some of the content is a bit strong for the average person to handle, but it's also because the film itself is so experimental, slow, and strange in its approach that it may not appeal to many, who will probably find it to be a self indulgent mess of wasted talent and needlessly gross imagery/concepts. But, I tend to believe that this is a masterpiece that just so happens to require heavily acquired taste for the viewer to take anything meaningful and positive from the experience. Some fans of ""Antichrist"" may be sadists or arrogant film students, and some detractors may misinterpret it by calling it ""sexist"" (it's more of a subtle, largely neutral commentary on the origins and most ancient types of misogyny than a work that endorses said concept) or labeling it as a stupid, pretentious, ""artsy-fartsy"" pile of art-house retard sh*t, and I oppose both sides. i just like a good movie, and it just so happens that ""Antichrist"" is not only a good movie, it's a great one, one jam packed with meaning, intelligence, surrealism (as well as realism), beauty, psychological terror, claustrophobic chills, and much more.",Antichrist
54,p-stepien,Chaos is not a good scriptwriter,2,24 May 2010,"Chaos reigns in this art-house comedy. Really... I haven't laughed so much since watching Hot Fuzz.Trouble starts straight from the word go. The movie ignites with a black and white scene, where He (Willem Dafoe) and She (Charlotte Gainsbourg) are having hot sex (genitals shown and all), their kid wanders out of his crib and jumps from the apartment window to his death and all this time we are accompanied by wallowing opera music. If the penis and clitoris pictures weren't enough to make this scene ridiculous (instead of tragic) the music was the coup de etat. After such a tragic scene normally I would be heartbroken (I'm easy to tear-jerk... I cried at the opening scenes of Up). But I was uninterested and just strongly annoyed by the sequence (which felt pretentiious and like it was made by an amateur, not by the great Lars von Trier).To tell the truth it does show some promise afterwards, when He (a psychotherapist) decides to help She cope with the death of their baby. It starts building up but falls down quite quickly, because basically the whole therapy didn't make much sense. How the fear of the woods is supposed to help her cope with her loss is beyond me... but I guess von Trier force-fed us solutions so he can go from point A to his totally idiotic point Z.Now... normally I admire von Trier. He makes you go places you don't want to go and really pushes the envelope. Even if I don't like the movie I admire his work. Not this time. The story is a disjointed mess which seems mostly to egocentrically focus on von Trier's self-indulgent film masturbation. I tried to treat him seriously but the moment a fox said ""Chaos reigns"" I lost my composure and the laughter just took control of me. The movie DOES NOT pose any interesting questions as an art house flick, but it sure as hell pretends to be deep. As a horror movie it's not frightening nor intriguing - it's just gross. But as in any decent horror flick your main protagonists are rather stupid and seem devoid of any rationality.People say this movie is controversial. I disagree - it doesn't deserve to be treated as such. At best it is torture porn that fits perfectly within the confines of such movies as Hostel. To tell the truth the movie I would liken this von Trier disaster is the french horror ""À l'intérieur"" (2007), which is equally dumb despite having a promising pretext for the movie. The only controversial part in this movie was the dedication to Tarkovsky and I personally found this film being connecting with the great Russian a travesty.Von Trier tried to push a boundary, but apparently lost his footing and fell off a cliff. I wouldn't really recommend this movie, unless you like torture porn. Even then the movie isn't really anything extreme and the most controversial scenes are a couple of notches below what the Saw franchise serves us. The only thing that makes this one stand out is all the penis and clitoris up-close mutilation (but you can get that done better in Japanese sex-ploitation movies).One more thing: Defoe was great, but Gainsbourg gave one exemplary 80s horror movie performance of bad acting.",Antichrist

But that one had a story, had a development; in here, it's just an insane girl and a conniving husband who allows her to do whatever she wants with his body, like cutting his leg off. The dialogs are so non sense... there's one scene that we see an ordinary wind coming to the window; and all of a sudden she says: ""Wind is Satan's breath"". WT*??? They haven't even mentioned anything about religion to that time, and she just says that. Not to mention other crazy saying: ""When the three beggars arrive, someone must die"".

The violence in question isn't a lot, but it's obscure enough to make you cringe. Never being one to shy away from controversial topics and imagery, Lars Von Trier creates one of his more disturbing pieces with Anti-Christ.I'm sitting here writing this wondering what I watched. Did I get it? Not really, there are too many scenes of symbolism and metaphors to grasp, and my wanting to grasp them are very thin. I got as far as figuring out who the three beggars are and even that is visually pointed out to you. The film is told in chapters, ""Grief"", ""Pain (Chaos Reigns)"", ""Despair (Gynocide)"" and ""The Three Beggars"". The film begins and concludes with a prologue and epilogue. Both which are shot in black and white, in slow motion and to operatic music. The opening scene shows some beautiful cinematography, camera work and it feels like art. The opening is my favourite part of the film.The story involved a couple retreating to a cabin after a family tragedy. While there, they try to cope with the tragedy, but nature has other plans. Weird to describe the story like that, but that's what happens. The two characters also have no names, at least we are not privy to them. They are known simply as He and She. They are also the only two characters in the film (aside from their son). Everyone else has their face blurred. The film has some explicit content. I would never let my kids watch it (if I had any). Genital mutilation, explicit sex, frontal nudity, misogyny are all key points in this film. You will feel dirty after watching it.

I laughed when the fox thingy growled, ""chaos reigns"" - foxes can't do grammatical sentences. Didn't know what to make of all the women lying around - vague stab at making gynocide relevant to the story. Those images were kind of eerie, but didn't really tie in with the mental breakdown of the nutter in the cabin.And I'm not complaining about the sex - the early scenes were brilliantly acted.The angelic singing was a bit pretentious.

The many developments, on top of that, felt forced, and when the three little animals lined up in a row, ready for the final attack, this fairy-tale was pretty much over for me.And, yes, there was some very good horror stuff in here, plenty of beautiful shots and the special effects were really something else, but if the drama doesn't work...5 out of 10, though I'll honestly say I'm a little curious to watch it again sometime.",Antichrist
61,Troy_Campbell,A provocative and challenging experience.,6,26 November 2009,"""I think von Trier is immature. I think he is even childish at times."" That's what David Stratton from 'At the Movies' had to say. His counterpart, Margaret Pomeranz said ""This is a bold, beautiful journey into the dark side of the soul."" Across the Pacific Ocean and Todd McCarthy (Variety) comments ""Lars von Trier cuts a big fat art-film fart with Antichrist"" whilst Roger Ebert (Chicago Sun-Times) gives it two thumbs up saying von Trier ""is driven to confront and shake his audience more than any other serious filmmaker."" Love it or hate it, no-one will argue that von Trier's latest sparks debate like so few movies do. Question is, is it really that bad / good? The answer is not that simple unfortunately.Split into six segments – Prologue, Grief, Pain, Despair, The Three Beggars, Epilogue – Antichrist starts off superbly. The unfolding of the prologue's ultra-slow motion sequence - shot in glorious, razor-sharp black and white and accompanied by the operatic 'Lascia ch'io pianga' - will take your breath away then leave you gut wrenched, such is its poignancy and emotional wallop. This powerful opening is a strong contender for best scene of the year, unfortunately assuring the rest of the film can't live up to it.Von Trier's unique use of images and unapologetic film-making techniques are irrefutably thought-provoking and captivating – the dream sequence of She is exquisite - but like most provocateurs, his excesses are plentiful and can often cause much frustration for the viewer. Rapid zooms and random side movements from the hand held camera, a bizarre choice from von Trier in the first place, are a couple of the annoying traits that are easy to look past in the beginning but by film's end will grate your nerves. The infamous, graphic sexual-violence is indeed just that: graphic, violent and terribly uneasy to watch. Not perverted or pornographic like some claim, however the necessity of showing as much as it does is questionable.Although second fiddle to the engrossing visuals and acerbic tone, actors Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg definitely deserve a mention. These two thespians put themselves through physical, mental and emotional stress that is a credit to their dedication and commitment to allowing a director realise his vision. They don't always convince as husband and wife - their complex love, passion and hate for each other feels fake at times – however in such harsh conditions it isn't unexpected.Antichrist is a provocative and challenging experience although you probably won't want to see it a second time.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",Antichrist
62,pyrocitor,Beauty and pain,9,5 January 2010,"There are certain films specifically designed to be uplifting, to take the viewer's mind off serious matters in their own lives by providing them with an enjoyable and forgettable piece of light entertainment. Needless to say, esteemed director Lars von Trier's Antichrist is not that kind of film. At all. In fact, it would be difficult to envision a single film which manages to combine even a comparable amount of horrifying and sickening imagery, a numbing gloom of nihilism and despair and a piercing, deeply disturbing insight into buried cultural trauma and philosophical and moral questions - and if a film did exist which managed to outdo von Trier's film, it would be staggeringly unlikely if many dared to take it in. Matching the inventively grotesque visuals with heavy moral questions involving the morality of gender struggles, the film is a gruelling, fundamentally draining experience, yielding an impact unlike any other.Nonetheless, despite its formidable array of repulsive elements, to ignore Antichrist's striking beauty, artistry and incredible craftsmanship would be truly unforgivable. From the breathtaking black and white prologue sequence to the later, more horrific events, von Trier finds visual poetry through movement (often slowed to a crawl to allow the viewer to drink in every last sumptuous aesthetic inch) and juxtaposition, as Anthony Dod Mantle's perfect (without using the word lightly) cinematography and shot composition frames the aesthetic against the grotesque, the frightening amongst the gorgeous, all exquisitely coupled with the film's awe-inspiring musical score. While it might seem a contradiction to find so much beauty in a film of such profound and resonant ugliness, von Trier relishes in the tension between the two, adding unspeakable poignancy to the viewer's reaction to the aesthetics or content of the film.Intriguingly, for a film which on the surface comes across as boldly dispassionate and morally void, there remains a profound sense of humanity etched into the grim underbelly of Antichrist, a strangely and barely discernible reassuring undercurrent somehow allowing the viewer to grimace through each sequence of disfigured animals and bodily dismemberment. Delving beneath the disturbing trappings of the film yields a narrative of great sorrow, lamenting the necessity of the horror and anguish on display, and ultimately drawing incredible sympathy for both characters, no matter how warped or unforgivable many of their actions might initially seen. In the end, removing the stylized visuals and larger than life moral themes reveals a quiet and sad narrative about the human process of coping with trauma (a theme which the film's title cards, dividing up the narrative, hints at), suggesting an internal struggle likely intended to be seen as more of a figurative internal process of coping with loss and than it would initially seem - oddly enough, the most obvious comparison is Kubrik's The Shining, albeit exploring guilt and tragedy rather than shame and failure. Looking back at the film with such a stance in mind yields a take on the film which is still unquestionably grim, but emerges as far more poignant and ultimately vaguely hopeful in spite of itself.The devastating beauty of the film's visuals is matched by the profoundly powerful and searing performances of its two actors. Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg are each eerily magnificent, with the contrast between Dafoe's iron, dispassionate calm and Gainsbourg's episodes of volcanic emotional cacophony is alternatively riveting, horrifying and achingly human. It is impossible to imagine better performances, and to see the two playing off each other is utterly magnetic, a work of art in itself.As with many such provocative works of art, the morality of von Trier's film has come under considerable fire, whether for its excesses in graphic, disturbing violence and sexuality or its alleged misogyny. But whether the film does indeed condemn women on a spiritual level (as many have claimed) or provides a critical examination of the behaviours and schools of thought which breed misogyny (more probable), it cannot be denied that von Trier's film fiercely and fearlessly raises conversation through its ambiguity and careful suggestion, and the profundity and moral/spiritual concerns raised show that none of the content, no matter how extreme or excessive, is presented idly or gratuitously. Either way, Antichrist is a fundamentally wrecking and moving experience, just as beautiful as twisted and horrifying, and those willing to stomach the extremely disturbing content, a truly unique and unforgettable piece of cinema and work of art is in store.-8.5/10",Antichrist
63,jaredmobarak,"Can't I just be afraid, without a definite object?  Antichrist",9,15 September 2009,"Willem Dafoe, getting to know the director during Manderlay, just happened to ask his agent what von Trier was up to, and so he made some calls to find out. It ends up that he was in the midst of a great depression and had written a script to hopefully turn that despair into something artistic. After taking a read through, Dafoe agreed to star, even though he knew Lars wanted to find his actress first. Thankfully, that woman ended up being the phenomenal Charlotte Gainsbourg, so all worked out in the end. Antichrist is much talked about, controversial, and a feat of pure artistic genius. Utilizing just these two actors for the duration, von Trier's very personal journey towards redemption and retribution comes to life; a tale of two parents finding out that maybe nature is really a creation of Satan and not God. This goes for the trees, the forest, the animals, and most especially human nature—that of sexual urges, the abstraction of love, and the turmoil of guilt and how it can ravage anyone's soul.Separated into chapters, introduced by full-frame textural paintings with hand-scrawled titles, it all begins in glorious black and white slomotion—simply gorgeous to behold. Set to a classical opera piece, we catch abstract glimpses of Dafoe and Gainsbourg's couple in the midst of sexual acts in the shower and after. The water falls over them in sharp clarity, each drop visible, bottles fall as limbs flail, and we see their toddler son escape from his crib. Stunning in its simplicity and starkness, it is as though we are watching moving photographs, each short vignette a static shot of contortion and physicality dramatically slowed to a crawl. This prologue is explicit—complete with a shot that almost guarantees it an NC-17 rating—but still retains tastefulness in its art and beauty. This is the moment that sets up the entire movie, two adults making love while their young child decides to catch snowflakes out the upstairs window  you can imagine the result of that and the feeling of extreme guilt and sadness that goes along with it. We are only ten minutes in and already imagery is ingrained to our mind, the slow decent of a stuffed teddy bear and the puff of snow sent up as we watch from the window above.The rest of the film is broken into the emotional steps a person goes through after such tragedy: Grief, Pain, and Despair. One more chapter is added before the epilogue, however, and it's of the Three Beggars. As spoken in the film, ""when the three beggars arrive, someone must die."" Religious undertones abound as the story progresses, Satan and God coming and going while Dafoe's therapist attempts to treat his wife for the extreme depression she finds herself in. He needs to find out what it is that truly scares her in order to cure her, trying his best to be objective and keep his love for her away. Every time she comes close to really approaching the pain at her core she gives into her sexual urges to help forget the suffering and replace it with lust. The very act that brought them to where they are becomes her escape, but the knowledge of what happened when they last were together can't be far from sight.A sort of Eden becomes her pyramid top of fear: the forest and all it holds to frighten her so fully. Dafoe smiles because it is Gainsbourg that always wanted to go camping, even going away to a cabin with her son while researching her thesis about the genocide of women throughout time. You start to wonder about her mental state and when exactly it fractured. The thought of walking on the grass scares her so much that she just runs for the safety of the cabin when they arrive. It is there that the pure evil of nature takes hold of her, turning her into a beast of violence devolving any semblance of humanity she had left. You may have heard about the genital abuse and extremely uncomfortable moments of harsh mutilation, and I will weigh in by saying it is all true and just as harrowing as you might imagine. Here are the reasons for a son's death, the body parts that take over, making all else seem unimportant against the sexual bliss of climax. Their sex organs are the murder weapons and have been throughout time. Hormones and feelings of superiority—males oppressing females back as far as can be remembered—equality unattainable strictly from what lies between our legs.Nature takes over and keeps the mind at bay, always stronger and meaner as a result. Once you remove your self from the constructs of man, from the city and all the creature comforts and ways to repent or cure, chaos truly does reign. However, moments such as Gainsbourg walking across a bridge in the forest, a long shot that fills the frame with trees, a purplish hue clouding the air as her body moves in extreme slomotion, call to mind pastel paintings worthy of gallery exposure. There is utter beauty amongst the depravity on display. With a final scene that's unforgettable with its mass of faceless women rushing down a hill, or the white bodies buried underneath the ground that Dafoe crawls over to hopefully reach safety, you will be moved by a full range of emotion, from disgust to beauty. I may never want to experience Antichrist again, but that does nothing to lesson its absolute brilliance and creative courage to use imagery in order to send an audience to a place they try to avoid at all costs. Lars von Trier takes us into the hell of the mind and refuses to compromise by letting us out for even a short breath of air. I don't think I've taken a deep breath since.",Antichrist

I'm not entirely sure what Lars Von Trier was trying to say here.. probably many things at once. But what I do know is that Antichrist represents the deep, agonizing depression of the director himself. You can tell by the sometimes wonky camera work, jump-cuts, confusing nature of the story and the at times gruesome and disturbing segments of the film. Would I recommend this movie? No, not to anyone with a straightforward mind. But to those who like experimental film, i'd suggest you give it a watch.",Antichrist
66,itamarscomix,Tries too hard to shock,5,14 January 2012,"I really want to call Antichrist a masterpiece, because I have realized over the years that when Von Trier crosses the lines and uses explicit violence and sexuality it's usually not merely to create controversy, but to promote a certain message. In this case, I'm afraid, the purpose of the extreme violence seems to me to be covering up for a flawed script and for not knowing how to finish his movie. The subtle, harrowing, unnerving horror of the first half of the film turns into too-violent, over-the-top horror in the second half and to me that's when it loses its way. Antichrist is beautifully crafted, well directed and acted, but as a complete work it's too flawed to stand alongside Dogville or Dancer in the Dark as one of Von Trier's great films.",Antichrist

68,abisio,Fight to see this movie specially the UNCUT version,10,9 September 2009,"First, I do not think ANTICHRIST is a 10/10 movie; at least in the 104 minutes version I saw. I believe it is a movie that requires lots of thinking and will affect everybody that sees it for long time. If a movie makes a mark like this one; rating it makes not a lot of sense. Second, women (especially mothers) will likely hate it; not because of the gore or violence, which is limited to few minutes on the end, but because of the evilness it portraits in them. Third, this is an art house movie; there is plenty of sex, violence and gore; but I do not think anybody even the most perverted or horny could be aroused by anything happening here. Why we have to fight for it? Well; after DANCER IN THE DARK, DOGVILLE and MANDERLAY, Lars von Trier was accused and labeled as ANTI-USA which is completely untrue. Trier, understand perfectly (more than most of the people living in this country) the reality of this society. He stated that the stronger abuse the weaker; but being weak does not mean goodness or innocence. We weak people get stronger they became abusers too. This clear perception of a reality nobody wants to acknowledge made him a pariah in the country of FREEDOM (?) . Do not let a greedy distributor decide what do you should see or not. This could be the best or worst movie you ever see; but it will touch you and FREEDOM means the right to decide yourself.",Antichrist
69,mario_c,"""A crying woman is a scheming woman""",10,16 October 2009,"Intriguing, surreal and shocking! These are just three from a large number of adjectives that we could describe this new film from Lars Von Trier. Those three portray in a very short but clear way what this movie is to me. From the beginning we understand it's not an easy movie to watch, to understand and to like. In fact it's one of those movies that you just love it or hate it, there isn't a middle term Well, I'm on the side of the ones who love it! Let's point why: 1) The cinematography. There's a lot to say about that but I can resume it in one word: excellent! Splendid scenarios; beautiful camera shots; artistic black and white photography; nice slow motion; amazing scenes that almost look like paintings (when she's imagining herself in the woods, for instance). Well, at parts this movie seems to be like a painting on the screen. Very beautiful! 2) The main theme: this discussion about evil and goodness, the Human condition, and all the connection between human, nature and some unknown forces, either evil or good. It also brought to discussion the feminine condition and the evil that also dwells in it. Sometimes we have the tendency to relate evil acts just to men, assuming that women are generally tender and kind, but we forget that women can also be very evil and sadistic. ""A crying woman is a scheming woman"". It's said in the movie and I found it terribly true 3) The shocking element that we are used to watch in Lars Von Trier's cinematography. This time he used graphic sexual violence to shock the viewer. Not that it shocks me! In fact I see these elements as a good point. I like films that are daring, that want to shock, and do something to break the rules. To shock people is a good part of the artistic message, isn't it? I guess here, my friend Lars, you did it! 4) Great performances of Willem Dafoe (HE) and Charlotte Gainsbourg (SHE). Notice that characters don't even have a name what is also quite interesting! Well, I guess I don't have to point out anything else This film is excellent, period!",Antichrist
70,Superunknovvn,"Empty at best, misogynist at worst",5,6 January 2010,"Do meaningful movies have to be exhausting? They can be, as Michael Haneke has proved this year with his demanding, yet fantastic ""Das weiße Rauschen"". Lars Van Trier, however, seems to have made it a practice to make his movies as strenuous as possible, just for the sake of it.""Antichrist"" is no exception. It starts out so slowly, it's hard to bear, and never really gets going. The trailer made ""Antichrist"" look like a genuinely scary and mature horror movie. I was hoping that Van Trier's take on the genre might be grounded in psychological terror. Instead there are two or three extremely uncomfortable scenes of physical torture, hostile animals and some cryptic nature metaphors. It's tiring and confusing more than anything.Just what is Van Trier trying to say with all of this? The movie seems portentous but does it have any message at all? If we take Dafoe's and Gainsbourg's characters as gender stereotypes, then ""Antichrist"" is a deeply misogynist movie, depicting women as the root of all evil, the downfall of men. So, maybe it was better if Van Trier had no message at all in mind, rather than the obvious one. In that case, however, ""Antichrist"" is just a tedious empty shell. You decide, what you prefer.",Antichrist
71,Likes_Ninjas90,The self-proclaimed 'best film director in the world' is not interested in finding resolution for these characters through any form of character development,4,7 December 2009,"Antichrist is divided into four chapters, a prologue and epilogue. During the prologue a nameless couple, who are billed as He (Willem Dafoe) and She (Charlotte Gainsbourg), are having sex, leaving their baby son unattended. The baby climbs out of its cot, reaches a window and then falls to its death. Both of the parents grieve heavily for their son but it is She who is most affected, slipping deeper into depression. He, who is a therapist, disregards her doctor and the medication given to her. Instead He decides to take her to a cabin in the woodlands, a place called Eden, where She was last with their child, trying to finish her writing. He attempts to treat her himself with a number of psychological exercises, but there is something terribly ominous brewing inside Eden.The first chapter to Lars Von Trier's Antichrist entitled 'Grief' remains compelling because of its authenticity and gritty sense of realism. The aesthetic qualities of the film and Gainsbourg's performance craft scenes of emotion that are utterly believable. Named Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival, Gainsbourg displays her grief and her anger with a real sense of heart. Of the two characters in the film she has the much grander role. The muted colours in these scenes, along with the dim grey lighting and Von Trier's erratic hand-held camera-work, further contribute to a reflection of her isolation and her heartache. It is a rather personal film for Von Trier as he is believed to have written the script as a means of therapy for his own depression.The aesthetics throughout the film are equally as impressive during the Eden sequences. The film was primarily shot in Germany and there are some visually haunting moments that both unique and beautiful. A scene where She's voice over is heard over the top of a painting-like representation of the woods, as her ghostly figure appears in the background, is just an incredible sight to behold. Von Trier has stated that a lot of his inspiration for the film has been derived from the horror genre and he aptly controls the tension through the authenticity of the woodlands, the use of near silence and the slow tracking movements of the actors. The continuation of the hand-held camera in the forest creates a sense of a detached body from the actors, almost as though someone is watching and stalking them. In one moment a wide shot films He walking through the forest. The camera pans quickly to the left of the screen and then centres back on him, almost gesturing him to move towards the rustling leaf and discover something very disturbing. Aesthetically, this is an intense and powerfully constructed film.However, as with Dancer in the Dark, the film's narrative becomes increasingly contrived over its duration, to the point where it defies all logic. That a therapist would treat his own partner, disregard her medication and take her to a place as isolating as Eden – regardless of what it means to her past – is a contrivance that audiences will have to decide on themselves. It is also when Von Trier unleashes the films fury and condemnation for these characters and the landscape that the narrative self-destructs. All of the emotion that was captured in those quiet, painful scenes is lost to moments of sheer absurdity. When He does find that rustling leaf he discovers a brutally wounded fox that stares at him, opens its mouth and then says to him in a demonic voice 'chaos reigns'. The ghastly animal imagery throughout the film such as this and also deer with a dead foetus still attached to it, contributes to an increasingly unpleasant narrative that detaches itself from the realism and the personal grief felt by the two central characters.The detachment is felt most significantly in the last two chapters of the film, which contain some of the most sickening and repelling acts of violence and sexual aggression in recent years of cinema. These moments are almost unwatchable and detract from the emotion and the conflict felt by She because of how absurd it is and because of just how awful it is to witness. The film attempts to attribute her behaviour to being possessed by nature, which is said to be a satanic form. Yet whether anyone will actually find that credible, in justifying such contempt for humanity and human suffering, is extremely unlikely. It is through these two chapters and beyond that the film is also increasingly uncertain about what it is saying in regards to women themselves. Von Trier does not think that his film is misogynistic and does not claim to be one either. His poor relations with his actresses over his career and the way a woman is physically and emotionally destroyed in this film, inspired by the execution of women in the 16th century, makes it difficult not to see his disregard and lack of respect for them. Von Trier has claimed in interviews that this is a representation of a woman's conflict with herself, and though this might be true, he offers his character here, just like in Dancer in the Dark, no outlet or redemption. He condemns them and sentences the, leaving his film as increasingly nasty and unsympathetic towards grief and anxiety.Antichrist is aesthetically and emotionally an interesting and intense film for its first two chapters. Yet because of Von Trier's persistence for publicity and attention through horrid acts of violence, this is a film that remains wildly distracted, unfocused and wholly unlikable. The self-proclaimed 'best film director in the world' is not interested in finding resolution for these characters through any form of character development. It is because of this that he weakens his supposed exploration of inner conflict in favour of his own needs to shock, manipulate and outrage his audience. As a nasty exercise in gratuitous sex and violence, this is a film to be avoided.",Antichrist
72,Christian_Dimartino,Nature is Satan's church.,9,12 November 2011,"Lars Von Trier. I had never heard that name until two years ago. Two years ago, I heard about a gruesome movie called Antichrist. And from what I had heard about it, I was immediately hooked, even if half the critics weren't feeling it.But of course, this movie was no where to be found. It never went to Redbox, Blockbuster, Movie Gallery, blah blah blah. So I forgot about it. But over the Summer I found this magazine that talked about it, and my quest to find it was back on. It was in no stores. It was on Ebay... for 40 bucks. The only place where it could be found was on Netflix. So, I got Netlfix. And the first film on my queue was AntiChrist.Was it good? Yes. Was it great? Maybe. Was it worth the wait? I would say so. AntiChrist is unlike any movie you'll ever see... chilling, gruesome, but at the same time erotic and arty. It's a psycho-sexual thriller with a lot of psycho, a lot of sex, and a lot of thrills.Danish director Lars Von Trier was in a mental hospital before he made this movie, so that may add up to some of the insanity. But it's a good thing that he did go there, otherwise AntiChrist wouldn't or couldn't have been the same.The film focuses around He(Willem Dafoe) and She(Charlotte Gainsbourg). One afternoon while they are banging, their son Nic falls out a window, leading her to go into a deep state of clinical and psychotic depression(sound familiar?). So He takes her to Eden, a forest where they own a cabin, and nature sort of turns them against each other.I was this close to shielding my eyes. There are a ton of shocking moments(the ball squishing, the clit cutting)that leave you on edge. But yet I couldn't turn away. It takes about an hour for the real insanity to kick in, and once it does it's worth it.The performances from the film's two stars are exuberant, especially from Gainsbourg. I have a hunch that Von Trier is a misogynist, though he said that he took She's side. I don't think so. She is a total psycho. Von Trier must have had a really bad experience in order for him to have made this. You can feel it in the writing, and that's some of what makes it work.If you have the patience, the stomach, and Netflix, you should see it. Otherwise, well, you might throw up. But it's only bad for about a half an hour. I loved this film,and I can't wait to see Melancholia, and the rest of Von Trier's works.A-",Antichrist

74,doctorsmoothlove,"God is all power, God is all love, but Evil exists",10,27 December 2009,"The world we inhabit is one of pain, death, and discrepancy. I wrote this piece and you read it while someone finally died of debilitating disease. My own paternal aunt will die a few days from now of cancer. It would then seem that Satan would be lord of Earth. We should come into union with him. Even the Bible speaks of this. Everyone is tempted by Satan and must actively choose to follow God. Could God exist as a human construct, perhaps created by Satan (or another entity) to compensate for our inability to rationalize the terror we experience?Antichrist is a film with no hope, no innocence, and no joy. It may be about how human beings are meant to live without the restriction of society. The story begins with a couple having sex while their infant falls to his death. He (Willem Dafoe) and She (Charlotte Gainsbourg) enter the first cycle of reaction: Despair. She cries uncontrollably while He dispassionately attempts to comfort her with faux psychotherapy. He is arrogant and her relentless shame is unnatural. The two represent a duality of sin that is in contrast to the world of God where couples join together to overcome loss. Instead, He ignores it and She suppresses it. They decide to leave their urban environment and venture to their isolated cabin and reach it to only uncover even more suffering. This is act two: Pain. He loses His human sympathy entirely now and subjects Her to even more discomfort by taking Her to a place of former anguish (as we later learn). Their condition deteriorates so they are both isolated from each other. They have become evil.In Part three: Despair, He learns that She originally came to their cabin known as Eden to write an academic paper on witch hunts. In Her work She came to believe women were really evil. Despite His efforts at informing Her of the stupidity of this view, She worsens and violently attacks Him. They flee into the forest as acorns crash into the tin roof and copulate while disembodied hands reach at them through the trees. He realizes His role as potential Antichrist by attempting to disavow himself of his past wrongs. He cannot do it. His behavior caused the unnecessary suffering of another. She realizes Her role as potential Antichrist by inflicting the same pain on Him that He originally gave Her. Neither can reside within the world and one must die. If Christ (God) is a single entity, then Satan must also be a single entity. This is where the film culminates. Act four shows their struggle for dominance and He kills Her. She was as guilty as He, but He was the cause of the original sin. He was the one who lead Her into sin and made her evil.Antichrist is not a film condemning Christianity. He and She and their world are instead the opposite of a Godly world. As love is not opposed by hate but by disinterest, Satan's world is in contrast with God's but not opposed to it. Unlike the biblical telling in Genesis, women are not the fountain of evil. Men are. The film is misogynistic not in its visceral depravity (which you can easily read about online) but in its assumption that women are required for evil to come into being. She is exposed to corruption by reading about male brutality towards women. He worsens her condition by enforcing what She has read in modern context. He represents all that is evil from the beginning. She represents human vulnerability to evil. The film correctly assumes we live in a patriarchal society (which is still mostly true in many parts of the world) and condemns men for not treating women properly. Even in Her struggle to overcome Him, She still fails. God and Satan may be fundamentally different, but according to von Trier both are sexist in favor of men.He says, ""Nature is Satan's church."" The cabin they visit is called Eden and is surrounded by forest. This is Satan's way of choosing his vessel in the human world. He is the successor and may use His arrogance to corrupt more people, notably women. Their sexual interaction is thus never pleasurable. One always dominates the other. In this world, unlike what preachers say, sex isn't about pleasure. It has no purpose. Both of their genitals are destroyed to ensure the continued presence of the best dark candidate. In another era, a new vessel will be born of someone else.Much has been written about the film's explicit violence and sexuality. I won't describe them here. Von Trier had an idea in mind when he crafted this film. He even knew the title before he wrote the script. I think nearly any unspeakable act in this baroque setting would seem possible.

75,cinematic_aficionado,within versus outside,8,24 July 2009,"Antichrist is a spectacularly and grotesquely disturbing film. As a matter of fact this is one of the most disturbing films I have ever watched, if not the most disturbing of all. Being as it is makes it a polarising film because it is hard to like, therefore you can either passionately dislike it or appreciate the artistic endeavour.With regards to the film itself, the opening is just stunning; it takes you back to a different era of cinema and it even occurred to me that I was watching either Bergman or Kieslowski. The rest of the film engages you pleasantly with provoking dialogue and eye-catching cinematography but it will also engage you unpleasantly with several explicit sex scenes. It just has an ambiance about it you cannot deny. Even the plenty & passionless sex scenes, which I found very upsetting, were used to convey certain messages and weren't there in vain. There is of course a downside to this because large parts of the movie going public will eschew this film because of its sheer explicitness.Lars Von Trier disregards the word ""limit"" and goes ahead to assaults us both visually and emotionally. This film is both deep and heavy and the story is about tragedy, the battle with one-self, coping, loss and losing it.Then of course comes the part of the title. For a large part whilst watching it and even now, the choice of title simply didn't register with me. I even thought it was a publicity stunt in an attempt to attract attention but it somehow seems that it refers to the daemons within a person rather than the mainstream view of Antichrist. Perhaps this is what is actually disturbing about it: the gruesomeness we see in the naked eye reflects the ghastliness of the battle within.Summarising I'd say this is a film that you need to watch with an extremely open mind, if you are even slightly puritan just do not bother, and can potentially make a great topic for discussion afterwards with a group of friends, something which I intend to do when it comes out on DVD.In my opinion Lars Von Trier deserves 4 out of 5 stars simply because he created something which is daring, provoking, unusual and did so whilst being fully aware that this will not be a commercially successful film.",Antichrist

77,loganx-2,Hell,7,9 May 2010,"To begin at the beginning we observe a couple have slow motion sex in black and white (a scene which violates every Dogma 95 rule in one fowl swoop), in the shower, in the bed, from the wall to the windows. It's from such a window their newborn falls out of like the apple from the Tree of Knowledge mentioned in the Book Of Genesis. Willem Defoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg play said couple, though the genitals on display during this scene are porn actors from Von Trier's old defunct porn production company. Gainsbourg is depressed so much so she has to be hospitalized. Defoe is a therapist who believes the younger psychiatrist assisting his wife is inexperienced, and certainly no one knows his wife better than he does he should handle her treatment. Though it's widely said that you should never psycho-analyze anyone your intimate with, well Defoe knows best. These early scenes are shot in an inky blackness, where most of the room, and reality itself is obscured by shadows in their apartment. They are in darkness as soon as the ""healing"" begins, and once they come out into the light of day things get worse. Gainsbourg wants sex to feel anything besides the nothingness of her depression, but Defoe plays hard to get because as he says and later conveniently forgets ""you shouldn't have sex with your therapist"". They decide to take the healing process to the next level, when Gainsbourg confesses to being terrified of the forest she vacationed in with their son the summer before, and Defoe decides it's the perfect place for a picnic. On the way to the woods, after dumping her medication in the toilet, he gives her a post-hypnotic suggestion, that she should become ""one with the green"" she was afraid of; his biggest mistake. Though it's implied later that she may have been disintegrating mentally well before her son's death, for my money, it's the moment on the train that most firmly roots her in madness, asking her to identify with what she considers absolute evil, pain, and torment. What follows is more ""therapy"" were blades of grass become like a psychological iron maiden, the falling leaves turn to symbols of all encompassing death and decay, and that's not to mention the half aborted deer, undying crows, and the now legendary talking foxes. Lars Von Trier said he watched and enjoyed ""The Ring"" and ""Saw"" before attempting to make his own modern horror film. Von Trier's signature theme of an idealist undone by his own hubris also remains intact and perhaps what is most horrifying about the films is that Defoe really is only trying to help. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. The title itself is a play on words of an earlier Defoe film ""The Last Temptation Of Christ"" were he played another guy who was just trying to help. The director also admits he identifies personally with Gainsbourg more than Defoe, but this and many other reviews not withstanding, I don't think the film is as anti-psychology as we've been told. After a particularly symbolic dream Defoe tells his wife about, she responds ""but I thought dreams had no significance to modern psychology. Freud is dead remember?"" What follows is ironically some text-book Freudian castration and literal battle of the sexes. The imagery is muddled but it's apparent, that Defoe is ultimately ""to blame"", for the episodes at Eden. However, what went on there the summer before, where Gainsborug was hearing the voice of a mysterious child, tied her sons shoes on backwards (to the point of deformity), and started a collage of female torture and mutilation, points to far deeper problems than Defoe can be held accountable for. Something is very wrong with Gainsbourg.Some people believe there is nothing at all intentionally comical in the film, but am I the only one who picked on Defoe's tortured predicament; ""the old ball and chain""? Not to mention the undying crow, who squawks louder the more you more punish it. The crow is a good metaphor for repression, buried underground, and louder the more you try to smother it, but any time a man is fighting an animal especially one he is far larger than, you can expect chuckles. It's one of the unwavering laws of the comedy universe; example Monty Python And The Holy Grail's ""Rabbit of Caerbannog"". ""Look at the bones man! Look at he bones!""Its very easy to call a film misogynistic when it does most of the work for you, having a women writing a book called ""Gynocide"" about the oppression of women over the centuries (the burning of witches, dowry death, honor killings, and murder by husband), who comes to believe women are evil because nature is evil and women are nature (""become the green'), and mutilates her own vagina. The movie is about the fear of women and the symbolic transference of women as symbols of nature, the unfathomable unconscious, and irrational nature of life; it shines a light at itself in ways . All this after her husband treats as her a hysterical prop in his greatest moment of therapeutic accomplishment. He deals with his grief by attempting to smother out his wife's grief; controlling her is controlling himself.There hasn't been a psychological horror film this excessive, this direct, and this controversial (at least not in America) since Stanley Kubrik's ""The Shinning"". Like Kubrik's film Anti-Chirst flirts with the supernatural and uses it to unmask a crumbling patriarchy. Also like Kubrik's film the non-sequiturs are most haunting; a talking fox in the bush is worth two mangled labia's in the hand. Anti-Christ does not show the devil creating the world, instead it shows people making a hell of each other lives. A hell I imagine for the director and many others is much more horrifying prospect than anything the devil could dream up.",Antichrist

80,baileycrawly,...,3,3 July 2020,"Every now and then there comes a film carefully constructed with the intention to shock and revolt its audience. Actually, these films happen more often than we may realize, but the majority of them are so bland and forgettable that they slip through the cracks, gaining their fifteen minutes of fame but never being discussed as frequently as their competition.
Antichrist is one that belongs in the latter category but has somehow managed to maintain a status in the former. Sure, the acting is okay - that is, of course, when the characters aren't engaging in graphic sex, which is an unhealthily large portion of the runtime - but that's where most of the praise comes to an end. The score Is effective, providing a sense of unease whenever it's required, and then kind of slipping away for the rest of the time.
This is a film lacking in any plot of real substance. More often than not, horror works harmoniously with thin plots, but this is a film that needed a little something more. A tragedy and a ton of sex just aren't enough to hold a film and, despite Dafoe's acting abilities and celebrity status, he just doesn't bring enough to keep this sinking ship afloat.
This is nothing more than an art house film, something just like The Witch. An avant-garde film produced by a pretentious director for ""woke"" film buffs who ""get it"" to obsess over while insulting the rest of us for being too stupid to understand. This film isn't that hard to understand - that is, when it's grounded in some semblance of reality. We get the plot, it's just not a good movie.This movie is shocking for the sake of being shocking. It's written into the plot simply because the director knows it'll revolt the audience and anger the sensitive censor boards. It's graphic, and it's shocking, but it's also highly forgettable. There's not a single second of the movie that sticks with the viewer after it's over, except the looming regret of 105 minutes of precious life wasted.This is a highly skippable dud. Don't waste your time on it. Even for an ""art house"" experience. Even if you tend to gravitate toward avant-garde films, just avoid it. It revs up the engine from the very beginning and spends the rest of its runtime in a hurry to go nowhere. SKIP.",Antichrist
81,moviemanMA,This movie you won't soon forget,8,17 September 2009,"Lars von Trier's Antichrist premiered back in May for the Cannes Film Festival. Before the film had even been screened tickets were sold out. There was a buzz in the air about this radical filmmaker's latest project, and for good reason. The film was well received and by some ostracized by others. There is not a lot of room for grey area here. It's clear cut, black and white that you will either love or hate this film.It opens with a graphic sex scene between the films stars Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg (who are never given names). It's backed up by a beautiful segment from Handel's opera Rinaldo (the title is ""Lascia ch'lo pianga"", which translates to ""Let me weep"") and accompanied by images of profound beauty and sheer horror. Without giving too much away, after the death of their son they decide to go off into the woods, ""Eden"", to a cabin frequented by Gainsbourg and her son.She must deal with inner demons and the pain, suffering, and grief of losing her son. Meanwhile Dafoe, a therapist, believes that he can help bring her back to reality by confronting her fears and overcoming them with her. Then things take a turn for the worse.As pieces of the past are revealed and confronted, things start to change inside both of them and in nature around them. Black magic, satanic rituals, and Hell itself come forth in brilliantly executed fashion. As painful and disturbing as some of the images are, one can't help but overlook the attention to detail in every shot.For those who cannot overlook the images, this is probably not the film you are going to want to see. There is graphic nudity, a lot of sexual activity, and violent, often disturbing images. It's a lot to process at times but the finished product is well worth it.I can only imagine what it was like filming for this. There are really only two characters seeing as we never formally encounter the child. Dafoe and Gainsbourg, who won the Best Actress award at Cannes, give passionate and devoted performances. There are certain boundaries that some actors won't cross but they both go over the edge and beyond.Trier presents a startling concept of human nature and the presence of evil in the world. It's unsettling, uncomfortable, and borderline disrespectful (and there have been and will be several debates about Trier's portrayal of women in the film). I see it not as an attack on women but an investigation of something that has long since been forgotten and overlooked. The presence of evil, or more directly the devil. How far we have come from those days of accusing women of witchcraft. Nowadays our focus has been on terrorism, drugs, and other evils in the world, forgetting about the root of all evil. Trier brings us back to that first evil that tempted Eve (I wonder why Trier chose to name the woods ""Eden."")It's hard to say this film was enjoyable. Nobody ever likes seeing images like this. However I feel that films like this can be deemed as necessary and acceptable when approached correctly. Antichrist might not be the most controversial film of all time, but in recent memory I can only think of a few that come close. Who doesn't like a good controversy?",Antichrist
82,blackmamba99971,What a beautiful vision,10,26 July 2016,"First this film is incredible. Lars Von Trier really surprised me with the subject of torture. Using who was once a happy married couple losing a son from falling out of a window to suddenly change the scenery to the woods so Nick (Willem Dafoe) can help treat his wife from sheer depression. Yet not all is as it seems with his wife (Charlotte Gainsbourgh). A woman who deep down is as sadistic as the devil himself using an extreme amount of torture against her husband. Sex is the only means to satisfy her craving but injected with pain as she drills a hole through his leg, and mounts a thirty pound grinding wheel to it with a tightened bolt. An amazing view on how dark the human condition can get out in the middle of nowhere with no way to contact any other soul. What I found interesting was how Lars gave us evidence in small amounts to show that his wife was also the one who allowed her own son to fall to his death just because it gave her an orgasm. Satisfying her craving in the process. I loved how the story evolved at how Nick (Dafoe) found her work or thesis about the use of torture in the dark ages during Tomas Torquemada's time. Who by the way was head of the inquisition, and helped to realize the dreaded Maleus Malefacorum. Hats off to Lars who brought us something different in the way of how we as a species can sink so low in depravity, and ridiculous fetishes such as torture using even the most innocent of human life. It is a stark, raw, and empowering feature that is not for the faint of heart. I highly recommend this to those who lurk in the dark, and give high warning to those under the age of seventeen. This is not your usual gore flick. It is a deep symbolic look at how the human mind can work, feel, and dream about some things that should be left untouched.",Antichrist

84,TheExpatriate700,"Well Made, But Confusing and Pretentious",6,8 January 2012,"Antichrist is a beautifully shot but ultimately too confusing horror film that tries too hard to make a point. Although director Lars von Trier brings great skill in shooting the film, his script fails to make a coherent point.The film follows He and She, played respectively by Willem Defoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg, as they try to recover from the death of their son. Initially, the film seems like it will be a study of someone slipping into insanity, like Roman Polanski's Repulsion. Its examination of the couple's differing reactions is genuinely compelling, with it initially being a matter of debate which character has been more damaged by their loss.However, once they get to the woods as part of Gainsbourg's therapy, the film enters bizarre, even surreal territory. It goes from a character study to a borderline incomprehensible horror film.Much has been made of the film's graphic violence and torture. Although Antichrist received coverage from horror magazines such as Fangoria, it is not really a film for gore hounds. The character study portion goes on for roughly half the movie, and will bore anyone seeking a shot of gore. To exacerbate the matter, much of the horror is played as metaphor, so that many horror buffs (and many art house fans) will be looking at the screen scratching their heads.The film is good on a technical and performance front. The cinematography is genuinely beautiful, with some scenes evoking classic paintings such as those of Hieronymus Bosch. Defoe and Gainsbourg both do well with their roles. However, von Trier's tendency towards pretension prevents this film from getting a higher rating.",Antichrist
85,LloydBayer,When evil consummates with madness...,6,1 July 2011,"Let's get one thing absolutely clear. This is not your usual run-of-the-mill horror movie. This is not a slasher flick. This is not a scary ghost story. There are no jumpy scenes or ""look behind you for God's sake"" moments. This is unconventional film making that relies on a plot of psychological terror born deep within the bowels of madness. ""Misery"" and ""The Shining"" are perfect examples of what I'm driving at. Even so, those only manage a tap on the shoulder when compared to what we have here; a film that can give Stephen King a frightening jolt.Danish film writer and director Lars Von Trier has done it again. Infamously anti-Hollywood though he may be, it is without question that his story telling methods are progressively ground breaking. Additionally, there is also an overwhelming level of art with an unmistakable Von Trier finish. Premiering at the Cannes Film Festival, ""Antichrist"" opened to mostly positive criticism amongst audiences either loving it or hating it instantly.On the positive side, Von Trier's mind boggling script was found to be imaginative and terrifyingly original allowing the plot to be carried out by just two characters in the entire film. Cinematography though eerily beautiful, varies from stunning wide angle landscapes to disturbing close-ups to amazingly rendered slow motion sequences by Anthony Dod Mantle whose previous contribution was towards the multi-award winning ""Slumdog Millionaire"". Acting forms the best component here and is frighteningly realistic coming from Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg as two nameless characters playing a therapist and his author wife.The plot plays out in four chapters starting with a prologue where He and She are at the height of sexual ecstasy. But even as they are preoccupied in the seconds before carnal gratification, their toddler finds his way out of his crib and onto the ledge of their multi-storied apartment complex. In monochromatic slow motion with the complementing score ""Lascia ch'io Pianga"", He and She climax together, unaware of their child's fatal fall onto the snowy pavement below. Chapter one, two and three are depictions of grief, pain and despair as the couple struggle through their loss. Caught between his profession as a therapist and parental grief, He takes it upon himself to get his wife back to a normal healthy state of mind. But blaming herself through negligence, She spirals out of control, until they decide on exposure therapy by spending time recovering in a desolate cabin in a forest called Eden. Wrong move. This is where a dialogue dependant plot ends, giving rise to horrific symbolism and metaphors. Strange things then start to happen in the form of bad omens recurring in an amplified atmosphere of evil in its purest form. Opening Pandora's Box, He discovers a thesis written by his wife connecting the dots between medieval female genocide and her theory that women are innately evil, given their affiliation with Eve's original sin. Before having to cope with his wife's increasingly insatiable and inhuman sexual lust, He also discovers a strange abnormality in his deceased son's autopsy report; a cruel truth his wife may have been trying to hide.By the end, and if you haven't been paying close attention to the conversations of the bereaved couple, you will be wondering who the antichrist is or what form it manifests. This is exactly what generates some of the film's negative criticism. The person who recommended this movie to me watched it expecting something fresh along the lines of ""The Omen"". But according to him, what he experienced was totally different and in his own words, ""held onto my balls for dear life"". Another negative response was the uproar made in spitefulness towards some extremely explicit sexuality, including close-ups of genitalia. Over and above, violence is of an unforgiving brutal nature where the camera refuses to pan away. You see what you hear and will squirm at what you see. That goes for both male and female viewers, provided you get to see the uncensored version.If you're the type who enjoys jumping off your seat, then there's the traditional fright fest like the Haloween series, courtesy Michael Myers. But if you're the type to sink into your seat and pray for divine mercy for watching something dreadful, then Von Trier's latest evil incarnate may be just the ticket.",Antichrist

Some of the violent scenes (certainly not all) are spectacularly beautiful. All the scenes are disturbing in one way or another.For me, the most horrifying image was the flashback to the prologue. I don't think her face can be forgotten.Let's try something different. What's this film like?Misery - the comparisons here are pretty straightforward. Crazy woman hobbles captive man. But Kathy Bates has nothing on this woman. This is a whole new level of crazy evil.Salo - they both have highly structured styles, dividing the main narrative into three chapters, and holding absolutely nothing back in terms of explicitness and violence. Both explore evil. Neither are forgettable, be warned.Frailty - reason succumbs to dogma, and the true horror is revealed to be that the dogma is correct in the final scenes. I haven't seen this comparison made by anyone else, but it jumped out at me right away.Birth of a Nation - Is the film itself evil? It can readily be interpreted as religious anti-woman hate speech, particularly with the epilogue. Maybe it is. Reasons I didn't score it higher than 7/10: * sorry, but birds die when you bash them that many times * faceless women at the end not explained well enough* I'm still deciding if I think this is hate speech * I have little time for supernatural explanations.

It's just legitimate ART!,10,3 November 2009,"First, let me just say that although I consider Antichrist a 5 star film - I understand that it's not for everyone. It's pretty clear why most people would not enjoy it.First of all, it is entirely a piece of art. Most people don't pick up movies hoping for what could be considered a painting which just happens to be moving, for an hour and 40 minutes. But, that's how I see this movie and I personally appreciate art films more than mindless ""entertainment"" (ala explosions, fast cars - and worst of all - characters who are seemingly unable to have conversations with any depth or personality in general). You have an open mind and a certain amount of depth to appreciate this movie.Second, the amount of explicit sex and violence brings modern film to a new height... And based off of what you read about this movie, it's clear that MOST people cannot handle it (Hundreds walked out of the early film festival showings earlier this year). Understandably. I haven't had my hand over my mouth, fighting so hard to keep looking at the theater screen...probably in all my life.I have NEVER seen such grotesque violence involving genitalia in a serious movie... only Troma movies and the like. We're talking straight up trash art. But this movie is anything but trash art - There are big brains behind it, insane theories and thoughts, and one of the most well acclaimed directors of our time in control of it all.It pisses me off when so many people try to call the movie pretentious - since when is flat out getting creative and doing what you want to do, and expressing things the way you feel them as a director... since when is that pretentious??? We need to appreciate the small amount of legit directors who are still making art films and getting them into theaters... Soon, actual personality in film will be extinct if the industry keeps heading in the direction it is...Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg easily carry the entire film almost completely on their own. They don't have too much of a personality but it's because they're not supposed to - they are just vessels or bodies, representing the terrible emotions they are feeling as they try to recover from the grief felt by the death of their only child. Not only emotions... but even more so, they represent human nature and how it causes us to react to terrible things - and the fact that there is nothing we can do about it...OK... I'm getting carried away already. I could go on and on.Antichrist may genuinely be the darkest, most morbid film I have ever seen. It's definitely the most brutal. It's easily the most horrifying experience of the year. If you're smart, Antichrist will scar you.The feeling of dread was unbearable.

It's almost as if Von Trier created this to purposefully traumatize Joe and Suzie Movie Goer. You have to come into this movie armed and ready to absorb every detail and then summon up the energy to start connecting the dots after it lays you out. You get nothing for free.The amazing thing though, is they do connect. If you isolate this down to a two character drama --- enraged, guilt-ridden, neglected, burdened by her sex woman vs. arrogant, blowhard, overly cerebral misguided cold male --- and then follow the events from there, it does make sense, even down to the --- you know.The movie speaks in a metaphorical and symbolistic way that many people will just find extremely irritating. It is not a movie you may want to see again --- and here I take issue with some of the splatter. It presses sensationalism over the film's basic message far too much at times.

91,rooee,A cold and distant place,6,16 April 2010,"Lars von Trier may be a trickster and a cad off screen, but we shouldn't overstate the extent to which that mischief bleeds into his films' narrative tapestries. He has made witty films and bleak films, and invariably intelligent films, but never a film which isn't to be taken seriously. Antichrist is no different. Ostensibly it's ludicrous, particularly the Grand Guignol last act. But for all the gory ejaculations and rusty self-mutilation, we shouldn't overlook two fearless performances from Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg, and some truly disturbing moments. The slightly sluggish sound of an infant's cries linger long after the ""Three Beggars"" have come and gone. Anthony Dod Mantle's photography always seems to capture the angle of greatest discomfort, although I found the excessive use of slow-motion stole something from the inherent chaos of the woodland locations, beautifying what might have been frightening and oppressive. I went into my second viewing of this film convinced that I'd come away the first time having watched a gruelling deconstruction of grief, laden with metaphors. The metaphors remain (and the gruel, for that matter), but this time I wonder if it's in fact a film about guilt. You know: those special Catholic guilts. Dafoe's ""He"" is too jealous to allow some virile young buck straight out of med school climb into his lustful wife's brain-box, so he steals her away. ""She"", meanwhile, feels such colossal guilt for defying Nature's will and using her body for the purpose of pleasure that only castration will suffice. And as He tries in vain to beat Despair to a pulp, before his mighty resurrection, one realises that Von Trier's message isn't just misogynistic, it's ferociously anti-feminist.Anyway, guilt. By the end, guilt surrounds He like an army. But equally this could be a film about fear. Or trust. In fact, the main problem is that Antichrist prods so many Big Themes, with such dourness and such a lack of irony, that it ends up in the curious position of being both Von Trier's most sentimental film and yet his least moving. Even Handel can't convince us otherwise.",Antichrist

Breaking the Waves is surely his masterpiece, the Idiots, well, a bit idiotic. This falls squarely in the middle for me. Full of self importance and symbolism but stunningly filmed.My 16 year old son arrived home just at the most graphic moments of ""real strong sex"" and proclaimed ""What on earth are you watching!"" I found the acting a bit too mannered for my liking. Charlotte Gainsbourg just seems to be trying a bit too hard throughout with her breathiness and Willem Dafoe is so desperately earnest that you entirely fail to engage with him.The ""torture"" aspect of the movie is actually a bit hilarious if the truth be told. What's it all about? Ach who knows, who cares really. Female and male stereotyping? The lack of god in the couple's grief? I couldn't really tell you and that's a pity because I think it is trying to desperately connect at some higher level.The scene where Charlotte Gainsbourg visibly cuts off her clitoris with a pair of scissors does make ""Stuck in the Middle"" during Reservoir Dogs seem rather light-hearted.",Antichrist

95,eagandersongil,"Symbolic, shocking, real and artistic.",8,7 August 2016,"""Antichrist"" is a film that surprises, full of symbols, dramas, very strong scenes and anguish, the controversial director Lars Von Trier in delivering a great drama movie / thriller / horror / romance, good, a film that makes a flete with several the seventh art branches. The photograph of the film is great at times gets to be transcendental, the soundtrack odds with the traditional genre films, but it is good and tight fitting, the performances are great, especially the Charlotte Gainsbourg (award-winning songs) the script has rhythm problems, some dialogues are very extended, but the film's plot is very good, full of surprises and mysteries that despite the lack of pace, let the glaze viewer in the film. I do not want to go into the various symbologies that the film back to because it varies the interpretation of each person, but it is worth mentioning some points, our protagonists unnamed go to a forest known as Eden, our protagonist blames himself for the death of the child, if guilt because they have sinned like Eve in paradise, the three beggars (as it is called the fourth chapter of the film) is a reference to the three kings, sacrifice is a way to pay for the sins of humanity to which the interpretation of it, women are the blame for sin, remember the final scene where several women without faces different bodies and ethnicities go toward the cabin, also to expunge their sins, that's some details of a very elaborate plot, the scenes of violence are heavy, especially the scene of genital mutilation was one of the most challenging scenes I've ever seen in a movie (and I've already seen a lot of movie junk stuck to Snuff), and explicit sex scenes too surprising, it is rare in a film, which leaves the performances of the actors in these dramatic moments, ""Antichrist"" really is not a movie for everyone, and many people will see it as a compelling thriller, others will be dazzled, others shocked, others will find an amazing movie and other will turn off the TV with 5min film is left you find out which group belongs.Forgive my English by google translator.",Antichrist

97,ilpohirvonen,Bunuelian Surreal and Tarkovskyan Poetic,8,26 February 2011,"This review contains major spoilers. Please do not read further unless you have seen the film. Thank you.Many people who come across with this film, are aware of its brutal violence and horrors. I've even seen a bunch of people call it a horror film, which it is not at all. It doesn't have the basic elements of the genre of horror, except if to some horror means experiencing fear and repulsion. It's the latest film by Lars von Trier who has been cutting wounds into us and into cinema during the past 20 years. He was the man who formed Dogme 95; a movement which tried to make people think about their relation with cinema by basing films on the traditional values of story, acting and theme, but embracing the use of special effects. But after wards Lars von Trier has moved to his own path and made several films that aren't considered as Dogme 95.Lars von Trier has never had a knack for doing tricky, ambiguous stories. He's a director who makes direct, linear and easy-to-follow stories. He doesn't leave us with a thick book of questions. But this is no insult. It's exactly what he intends, not to leave any unanswered questions but to take the camera so deep into humanity that there is no way back. The thing that usually bothers people isn't the ambiguity but the gruesome violence and the honest portrayal of it. The storyline of Antichrist is simple: the baby of a man and a woman die, while they're having sex. To recover from the pain, grief and despair caused by the tragedy, the couple travels to the woods. Eventually nature takes its course and odd things start to happen.The film consists of three acts which are called: grief, pain and despair. In the beginning, before the first act, von Trier has placed a prologue just as he had in the end, an epilogue. Both, the prologue and the epilogue, are poetic, shot in black-and-white, characterized by aesthetic styling, have classical music playing on the background and consist of nothing but static images - completely different from the rest of the film. The rest of the film is realistic, shot in color, obnoxious and not even close to aesthetic styling, doesn't have music at all and consists of nothing but dynamic images; the camera is in the move, all the time, through hand-held camera-work and camera tracking. In the prologue and epilogue the viewer is allowed to observe the situations as an outsider; but during the three acts we are forced to see the situations from the characters' eyes. It's quite a redeeming moment when you are once again allowed to be an outsider.When a good film gets thrown into the whirlpool of commercialism, this is exactly what happens. The film gets bashed for being dumb, weird or pretentious. But perhaps this was the intention of the director. To shake our relation with cinema and the way we look at film. I myself am in between, whether this is a masterpiece or a great film. Since I usually demand a masterpiece to touch, teach or change me, not always but quite often. To my mind Antichrist is von Trier's greatest film but not a masterpiece, which is no insult. It is a great, amazing film. It is a straight-forward film which doesn't leave questions, even if its ending is open for interpretation. The film is ultra-realism, for its honest portrayal of violence, but on the other hand it's surreal poetry. A talking fox, different kind of animals in the bedroom, are like straight from a film by Luis Bunuel.The influence of Andrei Tarkovsky, for whom Trier dedicated the film to, is strong and obvious. Perhaps through these similarities Trier wanted to salute Tarkovsky and also let the viewer who's familiar with Tarkovsky understand the film more. Andrei Tarkovsky was a Soviet master of the world cinema. His production was compact but extremely versatile; from historic epics to futuristic visions and deep movements of the human mind. In Antichrist the strongest references to Tarkovsky are in its visuals, poetry and thematics. The interbreeding of black-and-white and color shots is perhaps the strongest, visual, reference to Tarkovsky. The images of nature and strong poetic contrasts; reality and fantasy, life and delusions, are directly borrowed from Tarkovsky's debut Ivan's Childhood (1962). The dream episodes of the woman, bear a striking resemblance to The Mirror (1975), and the abandoned house in the mist looks familiar to those who have seen Tarkovsky's final film The Sacrifice (1986).The three acts represent realism but, in addition to the prologue and the epilogue, a few 'shock' images break it up; the man standing still in the rain of acorns, for instance. This reinforces the idea of interbreeding poetry and realism. The leading themes in Tarkovsky's entire production were the relation between man and nature, the inability of man to see, experience and get in touch with nature. During the first two acts of Antichrist these seem like the leading themes of the story as well, but it doesn't stop there. The inability of man to see and experience characterizes the film but to my mind it's also about the inability of man to understand others.As the title suggests, the film is a story about evil. The bottom evil in all of us. The woman teasing the baby and torturing her husband. To my mind, it was made quite clear that the woman saw their baby dying, falling out from the window and, she could've stopped it. But didn't want to. The ending of the film highlights the man's loneliness, the faces are unknown and impossible to identify, but it also suggests that the evil is in all of us. The Freudian id, something which many of us don't want to recognize but something that cannot be erased.",Antichrist
98,PeterRoeder,An enriching experience,8,13 June 2009,"I had heard a lot about this movie before I saw it but it wasn't anything like what I had heard. I thought the imagination-sequences were extraordinary. I have never seen anything like it on film. The sex and violence in the movie doesn't even fill out very much of the screen-time. This type of violence is very disturbing though, and I felt like throwing up after I had left the cinema. However, it is a very beautiful movie but it has no real plot which is a bit silly, I think. Surely a movie should tell some kind of story, and this one does not. It's a very interesting and philosophical, psychological subject matter, and very good acting of course by the two actors. Actually there were only three people in the whole movie! Anyway, I would recommend this movie. It is probably among Triers best movies. However, the sex and violence in this movie is very disturbing and disgusting and could have a bad effect on the faint of heart, perhaps. However, it is surely an interesting experience to watch this very imaginative film.",Antichrist

100,come2whereimfrom,A visceral journey into the mind,8,16 July 2009,"This is a horror film in the sense that humans and our nature allow us to do some horrific things, it's not scary but it will haunt your thoughts. After the death of their child during a breathtaking opening prologue, shot in ultra-slow motion black and white to the sound of Handel, He (Dafoe) and She (Gainsbourg) retreat to a cabin in the woods to treat her crippling grief. He, a therapist, begins to see her as a patient rather than his wife and as she spirals further down he becomes more emotionally detached. Cut scenes of woods (here a metaphor for fear), with distorted camera work and hellish noises make the film reminiscent of scenes from 'Evil Dead', the cabin, the moving trees and the fog but the real comparison is to that of 'The Shinning' with its isolation and deteriorating mental health. Loaded with symbolism, mythology, graphic sex and bloody violence it is not an easy watch at times but it is so well shot that ultimately you forget all that and just see how beautiful it is. There are a few twists to the story which is so layered you could spend ages analysing it and some amazing touches to unnerve you throughout like the acorns that constantly hit the cabins tin roof. But it's the two central performances that really make it, both look so emotionally draining to the viewer that god knows what it must have been like for the pair of them filming it and its this intensity that carries the film through its four chapters 'Grief, Pain (chaos reigns), Despair (Gynocide) and 'The three beggars'. The film is like going the wrong way down the rabbit hole, as it unravels so do you, as a viewer you are teased with symbolism and metaphors, punched with real sex and violence and challenged mentally as you try to seek answers in the visceral journey. Lars Von Trier never one to shy away from confronting the audience (I still can't watch 'Dancer in the Dark' after it broke me the first time) again puts images on the screen that some may not feel comfortable with, but they need to be there to create the whole emotional package. Bold, baffling and slightly disturbing 'Antichrist' was made during a period where Von Trier was dealing with his own depression and this reflects in the end result. Ministry have an album called 'The mind is a terrible thing to taste' and sitting at Von Trier's table one does eventually become full up.",Antichrist

But it is relentlessly boring, stupid and highly pretentious. I flinched, I screamed, I looked away, so kudos for that, but I came away feeling that the film was seriously gratuitous - shocking for the sake of it.

102,flicklover,"Pretentious, cruel film.",5,20 November 2010,"I came to learn of this film because of all of the controversy that surrounded it when it first was released. I had tried not read too much of what was the story so that I could see the film and decide for myself whether the controversy was warranted. I finally saw the film and fell that it was a missed opportunity. Director Lars Von Trier for the first 50 minutes of this film had been able to present a rare exploration of pain and grief. The story is very basic. A couple that is having passionate sex fails to notice that their toddler has left his crib and climbed to the open window only to fall to his death. The couple is obviously grief stricken, but the wife is especially affected, she feels guilty for her son's death. The husband is a therapist and wants to help her ina very cold and untraditional way. The couple is played by Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg. The couple is trying to deal with the loss, so they decide to go to a cabin in the woods called Eden to see if they can deal with their pain. the Gainsbourg character is the one that is most affected. The film had started very effectively, creating a mood of sadness and loss that was very effective. Then suddenly the film becomes a cruel and grotesque almost self parody. The film takes such a ridiculous turn into madness that I think that all the director wanted was to see how far he could shock the audience. We see mutilated genitals, a talking fox, a deer running while giving birth, but mostly we see 2 people finding ways to torture each other. All of this is presented in a very well shot, very pretentious way, with a lot of cinematic symbolism. But it is so off putting that the film lost me completely.Grade: C-",Antichrist
103,druid333-2,"""Chaos Reigns""",10,1 January 2010,"With those immortal words,uttered within the context of this film ,it all sets the pace for what has to be one of the most difficult,but captivating exercises in film from Denmark's master,Lars Von Trier. When a middle aged couple (Willem Dafoe & Charlotte Gainsbourg,known only as He & She,as no names are ever mentioned in the story)experience what has to be the worst tragedy that could happen to any couple (the death of their three year-old son). For ""Him"" (Dafoe),it is sorrow, but for ""Her"" (Gainsbourg),her grief is inconsolable. When he tries to get her over her mourning,he suggests going to the cabin in the woods where their son was conceived (a really,really bad choice). What starts out as chronic mourning turns into a full blown psychotic breakdown that only gets much worse for both of them. Her staunch religious upbringing brings out the misogyny that is generally associated with Christianity,which she believes is the absolute truth,which spirals out of control (she regards the woods as Satan's church,if you can believe that). Lars Von Trier writes & directs a corker of a psychological thriller that,although difficult (if not impossible for some)to watch,is however,easy to admire. What I really admired is the cinematography (by Anthony Dod Mantle),which contains both a prologue,as well as an epilogue in black & white,turns to muted,if not monochromatic colour, as well as the use of sound composition (by Kristian Anderson),and editing (by Anders Refn & Asa Mossberg). This is a film that will obviously turn some off,but others will find fascinating (especially students of psychology,as well as a few of the more open minded theology students). Not rated by the MPAA,this film contains pervasive,strong graphic sexual content, full frontal male & female nudity,some brief out bursts of profanity, and some truly disturbing,bloody,graphic violence that would easily land it an NC-17 rating (in fact,select cinemas have already enforced it's own,""no children under 17,under any circumstances"" rule for this film).",Antichrist

This film is centred around 2 people simply known as He (Willem Dafoe) and She (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and after the death of their son ""She"" spirals into a web of depression. ""He"" is a psychiatrist who tries everything in his power to help his wife, leading them to a forest area.

106,Jacques98,It should never take that long to get you on your knees.,6,6 December 2009,"What happened to movies that asked original questions?   They were replaced by laughable pseudo-""dark physiology"" films like  Session 9. They were replaced by unoriginal Kubrick rip-offs  like Irreversible. They were replaced by kindergarten-shallow  surrealist attempts like The Fountain. They were replaced by generic  by-the-numbers ""thought provoking"" Hollywood blockbusters like District  9. They were replaced by emo films about sex-deprived middle-aged men  like Watchmen. They were replaced by boring, shallow Oscar bait like  There Will Be Blood. They were replaced by shock films made by little  boys that couldn't get a girlfriend, got a couple years older, and made  a movie about it like Deadgirl. And if this website didn't limit the  amount of words in this review, I'd list at least 50 more movies in  this paragraph.  I'm no pretentious prick or anything, but, folks, seriously: Either,  (1) humanity is made up consecutively of second-grade English class  idiots, (2), I'm a super genius, or, (3), most movies are pathetic  excuses of cinema and storytelling. (In case you're one of the idiots  I'm talking about, #3 was the correct answer, by the way.)   But, it's our lucky day: Antichrist is far from shallow. In fact, it's  pretty much loaded. It's a smart movie.  But that's about it. As a story, it's pretty generic and formulaic.  The brains: Antichrist asks the questions: ""What if Satan, not God,  created the earth?"" And, ""If that is so, what would that entail for the  human race?"" You don't have to be religious to ponder questions like  this. The film often substitutes ""God"" and ""Satan"" for morality and  immorality; for normalcy and chaos; for purpose and nihilism; for  normalcy (Freud) and anti-normalcy (the subconscious). Personally, it's  nice to see a film take psychology out of the middle-school philology  class level that most movies use, and bring it into the real world,  showcased through realistic characters. This is less a movie about  people trying to find God (or Satan), and more a movie about two people  trying to understand the nature of pain and grief and cruelty on an  epic level. It's not another cliché ""Human nature is EVIL!!!"" film.  It's a film that asks WHY human nature is evil.  The brain that WOULD NOT DIE: As smart as Antichrist really is, it's,  sadly, also pretty retarded. The overall story is just the basic  beginning: hook/middle: plot/end: climax that they taught you back in  middle school. The ending scene before the Epilogue is so cliché, it  was basically copy/passed from The Shining, High Tension, Saw II, and  every other humanistic horror movie ever. It makes me wonder how a  writer/director like Lars von Trier can be smart enough to make a movie  that's . . . well, actually smart, but still make that same movie that  is this . . . well, childish.  Also, I should note a couple other things.  The movie tries to say something about sex and sexuality, but that  entire subplot becomes a cliché quick. There are thousands of movies  that deal with sexuality, and anyone who generally thinks they have  something original to say on the subject should be pointed and laughed  at. The movie literally opens up with shots of a middle-aged man's  butt, graphically constricting and flapping in a close-up sex scene.  His ball sack flaps into frame next. How's that for cinematic maturity?  I don't know about you, but artistic gay porn without any reason  whatsoever just isn't my thing. In American Pie, whatever. In a  horror-drama about the evil of human nature, it's hard not to just  dismiss Lars von Trier as a horny 13-year-old boy that can't get a  girlfriend. Stephen King explored many of the same EXACT sexual scenes  in his book Gerald's Game, which came out decades before this movie.  But where Antichrist uses sex for purposeless filler, Gerald's Game  uses sex to explain real honest events that happen every day. That'd  the difference between a hack and a storyteller.  The violence is average. Much less than you've seen in any of the  recent Saw or Hostel movies. I don't even know why Lars von Trier made  such a pathetic attempt to add such cheesy shock-violence that wasn't  shocking into this movie anyway. He defended himself in one interview  by calling it ""artistic honesty"". As if people really get bolted  through the ankle every day in real life. Yeah, honesty. Right. Uh-huh.  The cinematography, which everyone is raving about for some stupid  reason, is . . . pretty typical. Yeah, yeahyou have your  black-and-white slow-mo scene (Sin City) and your choppy scenes (Saw)  and your wide shot scenes (A Clockwork Orange) and your blurry scenes  (umm, every cheesy horror movie ever) and so on. There's nothing new  about this directing whatsoever. It's just a mash-up of everyone else.  What's the big deal?   And my final thoughts on the overall movie, I'll repeat that: What's  the big deal?   6/10   Postscript: Okay. Okay. I liked it. I liked it a lot.

107,Aly200,A Macabre Masterpiece that is not for everyone,8,21 January 2017,"Where to begin on this shocking and controversial entry from Danish director Lars von Trier? Firstly I will say that if you are squeamish or faint of heart do not see this film or read this review cause it covers some of the shocking elements of the film (without too many spoilers for the braver ones). And secondly this is not a film that is meant to be necessarily 'enjoyed' in the traditional sense. Director von Trier is no stranger to making controversial films as seen with many of his earlier films and subsequent entries like 2013's ""Nymphomaniac"". This film polarized critics and audiences around the world with its disturbing story of a grief-stricken couple who retreat to the woods after the death of their child and soon things begin to spiral out of control all amounting to one of the blatantly horrifying scenes of violence in its final minutes.Relying solely on two actors to carry the film in gripping portrayals of the unnamed characters, the director chose to cast regular collaborator Charlotte Gainsbourg (who does steal the show throughout) as the traumatized wife and as her unconventional psychologist husband is Willem Dafoe, an actor who is no stranger to bizarre films. The actors have a frightening chemistry as they cope with their loss in different manners; Gainsbourg's She starting out as a bereaved mother who is relentlessly bullied (through mental manipulation) by her controlling husband into believing her feelings are unnatural for the situation whereas Dafoe's He pushes the traumatic death of his son out of his mind in order to focus on maintaining his wife's focus on their needs in the wake of the tragedy.Things only escalate to darker places as the power struggle between the actors begins to shift by the film's third act when Gainsbourg completely begins to steal the control away from her costar as her character's mental state begins to unravel and She gains the upper-hand on her husband and starts manipulating him to do as she wishes which is mostly shocking instants of graphic content (I will say little else to spare the reader). By the film's final act, everything climaxes (almost literally in terms of content) in more than one shockingly violent act that will make even the most toughened viewer wanted to cower on the sofa, hide their face behind their hands or a blanket (which I had to do) or just turn the film off because if you watch the unfolding content, you won't be able to unsee what is shown.The film's controversy was primarily, and quite rightly, stirred up by the unflinching depiction of its sexual and violent content. Lars von Trier has long been known not to shy away from throwing everything at his audience. Here the content is virtually unwatchable as the debauchery on-screen makes one's stomach turn and dares you to look away (which is wise to do), but also daring you to watch what unfolds. Many have labeled this as ""trash"" or ""filth"" for showing such graphic situations, but I find there is a mastery behind the shock value. The director isn't dumbing down the story, but stripping it down to the bare bones and providing terrifying realism. It is fair to say it seems offensive, but remember it is still only a movie.Artistic merit has won out on some aspects of the film with praise for the stark portrayal of its theme of grief and the top quality acting of its stars, but the content is still heavily divisive. Maybe it is vulgar in terms of what is shown, but it is a masterpiece in its own right.If you think you're brave enough, I submit a challenge to my readers that you try and stomach this nightmarish drama. You might be rewarded for your courage, but it will not be for everyone.",Antichrist

In this graphic psychodrama, a grief-stricken man and woman—a searing Willem Dafoe and Cannes best actress winner Charlotte Gainsbourg—retreat to their cabin deep in the woods after the accidental death of their infant son, only to find terror and violence at the hands of nature and, ultimately, each other. But this most confrontational work yet from one of contemporary cinema's most controversial artists is no mere provocation. It is a visually sublime, emotionally ravaging journey to the darkest corners of the possessed human mind; a disturbing battle of the sexes that pits rational psychology against age-old superstition; and a profoundly effective horror film.The bodies are decomposing into the ground beneath them, perhaps signifying the hordes of people who had also succumbed to the evil depicted in the film.As many unrated art-house horror movies go, this one is no exception.

What occurs at the cabin is a dark twisted journey.The Good. Both Dafoe and Gainsbourgh do a good job with their characters. Dafoe has done a lot of strange movies and characters like this and definitely is suited to it. There were also some decent, sort of surreal scenes to add to the ""hellish"" theme of the movie which were visually interesting. There was a lot of nudity and graphic sexual depictions in this movie. These things definitely means that it would lose out on a lot of distribution, but I felt they were very needed in order to push the story. The Bad. This movie was very slow in the beginning and the ""artsy"" quality is not my thing. Movies are entertainment so stop trying to impress the ""art film"" crowd already. The boring beginning and subdued storyline definitely lets you know that this is a European style film, and I could tell before I even saw the directors name that it was made by a European. That's not a bad or horrible thing, just a style thing.I also thought the end was weak, and very anti-climatic. The end was a disappointment for me and I thought there was an opportunity to do a lot more with it. It felt as if maybe they ran out of time or money and just threw the last bit together just to be done with it.I mean, why not make Dafoes character hike out to say...a river, and meet a boat man....or something along those lines?Lastly, as I said in my good points, there were some good, if not interesting, surrealist visuals in this movie, but not enough. If you are trying to make some sort of artsy statement, why not bring that sort of imagery to the forefront instead of just a few tiny bits.I give it a 7. I can't really say that I hated it or loved it but a 7 to me makes it worth watching. The shocking sadism and graphic nature may have hurt box office returns but makes this one interesting and probably was needed. The European flair for boredom at many parts, especially the beginning and very end is on full display and definitely hurt this one, for me anyway.",Antichrist

113,RockPortReview,Interesting piece of Shock and Awe,6,30 March 2010,"This Lars Von Trier film from 2009 was one of the most controversial of the year. But did he purposely make it to shock and anger people? Most definitely. Von Trier's ego grew to new heights with this film starring Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg. It has yet to find a U.S. distributor and can only be seen through on-demand, online or if you have a multi-region DVD player.The two words I would use to describe this film would have to be graphic and intense. This film is divided into four chapters not including a prologue and epilogue. It involves just the two actors given the generic names of ""He"" and ""She"". The story starts with the prologue shot in black and white and in slow motion. Dafoe and Gainsbourg are having sex, while their young son falls out a window to his death. The rest of the film examines the couples grief, pain, and despair. These are also the titles of three of the chapters, the other being ""the three beggars"" towards the end.The imagery in this film is nothing short of jaw dropping. You will probably either think this film a work of genius or one of pure ego-maniacal crap. The story loads on the metaphors and graphic imagery to make the audience as uncomfortable as possible. Dafoe and Gainsbourg give absolutely fearless performances, earning Gainsbourg the best actress award at the Cannes Film Festival. Dafoe's character of ""He"" is very controlling and since he is a therapist, he takes over care for his wife. Although we find out that she is much more troubled than we are lead to believe. They retreat to a cabin in the woods they call Eden, which she seems to be fearful of. She spent a lot of time there alone with her son in the past trying to complete her thesis on human nature. It was never finished and this could possibly be a reason for her unstable condition. He relishes in the power he has over her and is the only way he can feel close to her. He really acts quite indifferent about his son's death, which in itself is quite disturbing.Animals and nature play a big role in this film and is often used as metaphor and symbolism. The last twenty minutes are intensely graphic and brutal, but is this in service to the story or just to freak people out? In a way it can be refreshing to see the actors and directors audacity to commit such material to film. So should you see this film? That depends, how hardcore are you? I mean it's not a great film by all means, but it is quite a spectacle. ""Chaos reigns"" quotes the fox.",Antichrist

With it finally ending about 10 minutes ago, as i type this i am literally cleansing myself of the filth & grime that watching this movie produces. I cant believe what i just saw. Now, there will always be people that will profess a other-worldly taste or mental fortitude as a reason why they can ""appreciate"" or, in this case, stomach a film like this. I don't buy it, never have. Sometimes it has to be called what it is...and this is trash. About an hour into the movie, waiting and praying for it to end, i was scheming of a way to spread the word to everyone i care about advising them to RUN from this garbage like the swine flu. My only saving grace is that its not a widespread release that the everyday person would hear about. What was the point of this film? For one to have to work so hard to make sense of any and everything put on screen is downright sinful. The evil of women.....sure i got it. Correction: I've HAD it.

117,Rathko,"Powerful, Disturbing, Beautiful",10,2 March 2010,"Following the death of their child, a therapist insists on helping his wife through her grief himself. She conceptualizes her anxiety as fear of the woods around their summer home and her husband, a proponent of hardcore exposure therapy, takes her there to face her fears. Once isolated at their cabin, however, her mental state rapidly deteriorates into acts of extreme physical and sexual violence. Reminiscent of the dark, psychological studies of Ingmar Bergman and Roman Polanski, 'Antichrist' is an exceptionally well crafted film from a director working at the height of his powers. A sense of darkness and foreboding begins from the very first frame and is masterfully developed through almost dreamlike scenes of increasing dread to an unbearable last act of brutality, raising fascinating questions about the historical depiction of women as agents of the devil, from the Old Testament to Freudian psychoanalysis. Though the violence, whether physical or sexual, is extreme and graphic, it never once seems exploitation, but rather a natural manifestation of the deeply disturbed psychology of the character. Willem Defoe and Charlotte Gainsbourgh carry the entire film with breathtaking performances of startling naturalism, courage and conviction. A powerful, disturbing, beautiful achievement.",Antichrist

119,pontram,Not made for being misinterpreted,7,19 June 2011,"Sometimes I don't understand people. Who in this world hasn't seen at least once in a lifetime an erected penis ? What is so bad with it ? There are so many men (and women, too) who consume pornographic movies, and now people were leaving Antichrist because of its sex scenes ? Thats ridiculous, if not hypocritical. At least since Pasolini the world should have become a bit less Puritan.A woman self-mutilating her on the vagina is a hard punch, I see that. But in the movie it was very consecutive, for me a bit too consecutive, even foreseeable.Antichrist may be an Art movie, but is mostly a story told. It's a story about a pair that can't overcome a great misfortune. There are symbols and hints, but I think they are not awaiting much interpretation. The movie itself is a symbol for it's creators fear of failing. Perhaps the movie itself is the Antichrist, or Trier's psychiatrist, or...decide yourself. In the movie there is no Antichrist in a common sense.I was concentrating on the story, how people can become mentally instable. How people can do false by meaning it good. How today's psychiatry describes and analyzes every little part of human emotionality as reaction to this, following that, like a dissection of a foreign software, like brain mechanics.In this case, all his psychological warfare against his wife's degrading condition doesn't save the husband from being nearly killed by her, and at the very end */Spoiler Alert/* he eventually overcomes his unbelievable patience and self-control, and strangles her to death and burns her dead body on a stake. And when he does (both killing and burning) so, I think he fulfills the wishes of his wife, who wasn't able to stand the pain of her loss, releasing her (and him) from that inner torture. */Spoiler end/* Maybe Trier felt like his female protagonist and wanted to create something that causes the world to burn him on a stake, and while a human who suffers this fate dies, Trier may hope to escape from this fire somewhere cleaned.But that's all only an assumption, which I try to establish because I refuse trying to reel in a bigger religious or mythological ship here. Religion may be a theme for Trier; but with Antichrist I only see it's absence; at most the absence of religion in case of healing someone's pain may be a theme here. To pull out the theory that nature is evil, because it's a statement in the movie, is also far from me. That approach would be very naive.What I missed mostly in the movie, was the personal suffering of the father. I couldn't follow his behavior, as I as a father would need the help of a therapist in the first place, if one of my children would die, and I can't imagine that someone would have the power to work as a therapist with that burden. Even if one doesn't seem to be touched by the sudden death of his child, he is, and the script does not provide this aspect. I would say, you cry for a father at his funeral, but you cry for a son a lifetime.On every other side I liked the movie as an impressing intense intimate play. The shocking moments are in no way self-purpose.",Antichrist

The movie is unusual because of a story that has some curious symbolism and surrealism relating to the natural world. But also because of the explicit sex and violence in what is clearly a thoughtful and artistic film.One of the lessons of this movie is that it's not the explicit sex and violence in a film per se that makes it exploitive or pornographic, but rather the STORY: Does it have depth? Is it well told? and the INTENT: Is there a purpose beyond exploitation or base interest? If the answer is yes then you have this movie.

If he trusted the editing, why use slow sections so dull that people fall asleep in the cinema? If he trusted the plot to reveal things, why do you need a talking fox? If he respected the audience, why the largely pointless on screen sexual mutilation? The film is essentially not about grief, though the word is used a lot.

122,chelano,Not for the weak minded. Watch if you can.,8,14 October 2010,"I will first say that this film had some of the best cinematography I have ever seen. The weird thing though is that after the film was over, I felt like someone had punched my mind over and over. Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg are the main characters. I enjoyed Dafoe more in the film though. There are about five scenes in this film that will test what you can watch without turning off your TV. That is all I am saying though. I can't really explain it without detail and the detail is well over the most mature rating you can think of. Those scenes really messed with me though. As for the story of the film, it was very interesting. Two parents grieve over the death of their son. They run to a cabin in the woods they call Eden. But this is not the good Eden you think about. This movie is based around a Satanic story. Instead of the Three Wise Men, you have the Three Beggars. This movie was done in an artistic poetic form. Every scene felt like a stroke of a brush or a movement of a pen. Then one of the most disturbing scenes would be thrown in to twist your eyes and cloud your mind. I am sure that is what the writers and director wanted. This movie was not meant to be gross, it was meant to warp your mind into a different reality. The film uses slow motion a lot. But it is all done very tastefully. They combine it with an interesting arrange of music. Some scenes have a classical sound and feel that keep your eyes on the scene. Some others use a sound that really feels like your ears are hurting as your mind twists. This film is not for everyone and I suggest only watch it if you feel you can. I know this movie is about Satanic rituals and has some messed up things in it, but don't hate it for that. Look at the movie as a whole and try to see the whole art in it all.",Antichrist
123,rmirchandani,A dark and immensely disturbing 'horror' movie,7,17 October 2020,"Lars von Trier's Antichrist is a grossly disturbing and graphic movie. It does not necessarily pertain to the horror genre as it feels more like an artwork than an actual movie. It follows a non-linear narrative. The movie is split into four chapters, each depicting different sides of the characters.Chapter 1: Grief
Chapter 2: Pain
Chapter 3: Despair
Chapter 4: The Three BeggarsThe Three Beggars are introduced right from the start and represent each chapter of the movie.The opening scene showcases extreme sexual content and is immensely graphic. To say that this movie is not suitable for children is a massive understatement. Similarly to the epilogue, the opening scene is featured entirely in black and white. No sound is heard, except for the music. The opening scene and the epilogue can be seen as a recurring leitmotif.The story follows a woman and man mourning the death of their son after being inextricably linked to his passing. The movie displays the characters deep struggle to assimilate to a reality without their child. The female protagonist is struggling with mental illness. One can interpret that she has schizophrenia and anxiety.When I was watching this movie, I could not stop thinking about the actors and how uncomfortable and awkward they must have felt when shooting these nude scenes. I reckon that the entire movie was difficult to produce and shoot for the two lead actors. Kudos to Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg for realistically portraying their respective characters. I can only imagine how traumatizing it must have been for them to immerse themselves into this gruesome reality.To conclude, Antichrist explores a variety of different themes and can be interpreted in many ways. It explores symbolism, sexuality, the dangers of mental illness, satanic studies, violence and the difference between good and evil. What I like about this movie is that the ending is open to interpretation. It has numerous different meanings and I find it intriguing what other people interpret from it. This movie is definitely not for everyone. It has a niche audience. The movie has received some controversy surrounding its content. I highly recommend you to think twice before watching this controversial and disturbing 'horror' flick.",Antichrist
124,bushtony,"Oh, come on...that's the audience at the end",3,23 September 2009,"Some while back, the consistently atrocious Ewe Boll made a film called Seed. His self-imposed agenda was to produce a horror film that wasn't any fun. On that level he certainly achieved his objective. He managed to fashion one of the most boring, mindlessly gratuitous, unexcitingly violent, plodding, pointless, meaningless and downright time-wasting movies ever.Whilst Boll is an errant hack with little or no cinematic skill or flair, Lars Von Trier is considered an ""artist."" He too has managed to craft a horror flick that isn't any fun. Now, before anyone starts yelling ""it's not a horror flick"" I'm going to tell you why it is.The plot cribs from some notable past masters of the genre - Dead Calm (1989), Don't Look Now (1973), Long Weekend (1978, 2008), to name but three. Traumatised couple decant to an alien environment to try and rebuild their lives following tragedy and emotional upheaval. Weird/freaky/disturbing events befall and violence and death ensues. As in Long Weekend, nature becomes a sinister force playing a malevolent role in the narrative that unfolds, and Antichrist even replicates the cries of a ""child"" in the wilderness moment that distresses the female protagonist in that earlier film. The images of dead and decaying wildlife, prey unto insects, are reproduced also. There are even elements of Friedkin's schlocky The Guardian (1990) submerged in there somewhere.So we have a standard horror/thriller setup. Next we have gore and torture porn components, framed and presented in no more disturbing ways than in the Eli Roth Hostel movies. Dafoe gets a manual drill-bit through the leg and a circular grind stone attached through the wound. However, there are certain aspects that set Antichrist apart. It wears artistic pretensions clearly on its sleeve with slo-mo black and white sequences which bookend the movie and are filmed like ultra-crisp and sharp high definition segments from a Bergman feature. Very tasteful. We also get a glimpse of erect man muscle. Wow. Daring.Dafoe's character, an anti-psychiatry therapist, drawls out the most pretentious sub-Freudian drivel and implements the most laughably inept psychotherapeutic formulations. theories and expositions yet expressed in a movie. Looking further back, the awesome confusion that arose between conversion hysteria and schizophrenia and the misrepresented psychobabble exposition for Norman Bates multiple personality in Hitch's Psycho is a work of deep and accurate psychological insight by comparison. When Dafoe's character reaches the absurd ""eureka"" moment of substituting levels of fear for the levels of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs it is, frankly, laughable.Antichrist is not particularly thrilling or exciting or scary, but then I guess it's not supposed to be. If it were, it would be closer to the type of film it is pretending so hard to be distinct from. Other main key aspects which are supposed to set it apart from its less arty stable-mates are the much touted ""explicit"" and shocking graphic sex scenes. Which are, to be honest, nowhere near as graphic in their depiction of masturbation and penetrative sex than the first five minutes of your average adult porno fare. The real coup-de-gras artistic credential verification moments, however, would be the erect penis ejaculating blood and Charlotte Gainsbourg inflicting severe genital mutilation upon herself with a scissors. I remember Regan self-mutilating with a crucifix in Friedkin's the Exorcist back in 1973 – that depiction lacked the intense visual detail the process is afforded in Antichrist, but the blood, sound effects and context made it a much more chilling affair all round.Von Trier must be having a laugh. He has taken tried and tested horror movie staples and wrapped them up in absurd psycho-babble, steeped them in controversy and repackaged and resold them as a piece of high art cinema.So many seem to have fallen for it. The only thing truly shocking about this film, considering the pedigree of some of the stuff the director stole from, is just how boring and meaningless it seems to be. The ending should have given it away – blank-faced children stumbling like sheep through a forest whilst observed by the main character. They're the audience, folks. They're us.Still, I'll give it 3/10 for Von Trier's dazzling sense of audacity.",Antichrist

He seems to be totally unaffected by his son's death after the funeral. We never see him crying, whimpering, or falling to the floor on his knees which I'm sure any grown man would do if they lost their child in tragic circumstances.Instead, he calmly goes into his 'therapist' mode and tries to ease the sorrow of his wife.THen they go camping in the woods. And strange things happen. And she turns out to be completely mentally unstable, and he has troubling dreams/visions of talking animals and such.It was just slightly hard to follow.

The fact that the kid dies accidentally while their parents are having sex reveals there theme of connection between birth and death: all the movie in fact is calibrated on the reaction between creation and destruction: the partners (one is a psychologist that tries to take care professionally of his wife, against the rules of his job) decide to go in an isolated house, in a forest, to try to pass the terrible situation through loneliness. But there Von Trier can show all his cruel conception of body and violence that brings the two in a spiral of self destruction and reciprocal violence, between erotism and sadism. Maybe the esoteric final doesn't work so well, but ""Antichrist"" is a great movie in perfect Von Trier style and allows deep considerations about death and the ability to defeat it.",Antichrist

128,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,7,1 October 2013,"Many see Antichrist as the classic 'I-wanna-shock-people' kind of movie. The one that features disgusting and never before seen things, that really disturbs you on every level: not just visually, but even thinking about the sick ideas that move the plot and the characters gives you the chills. And still, others see it as a modern masterpiece, made by the monster genius Lars von Trier, known for many difficult but excellent movies. A movie that uses gruesome material, but gives a lot on a mythological and mystical level as well. A movie that, technically speaking, doesn't fail: the acting, the cinematography, the direction, the lighting – every aspect is a pleasure to the eye. As for me, I'm a bit in between (oh, what a surprise). Von Trier is a modern director, always looking for new things to try out. He's known for his fearlessness in creating movies and making choices that many would disagree with. He likes breaking boundaries, and that's what made him famous and very appreciated. And that's how I see his movies: crossing the line, exposing every single idea that comes to his mind, and giving no s***s.Antichrist is about a couple, She (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and He (Willem Dafoe), that lose their child when it falls out of a window. Of course, the tragic accident has a huge impact on them, especially on Her. She starts having really unusual and exaggerated reactions: basically she goes bats**t crazy. So, they decide they're going to stay in their house in the woods for a while – where She usually goes to seek peace and inspiration when She writes Her books – hoping it will help. Ironically, that's when everything starts to go down. Evil materializes, shocking facts are revealed, and madness begins.This movie is meant to disturb, but for me it's the reason behind it that's fascinating: von Trier wrote the script and made the movie to cure his depression. If you know von Trier, you'll know that he's the weirdo in the so-called Hollywood class; and just like every genius that ever existed, he's kind of moody and unstable. So, whatever reason was there behind his depression, he wanted to self-medicate"" by writing pure evil. He literally (and, of course, metaphorically) made evil fall upon Eden (the place in the woods where the characters reside for the most part in the movie; and the place where Adam and Eve lived, according to the Bible). He created a main character that hates herself and her entire gender, and tortures herself because she thinks the female gender is the purest of evils. Well, who knows what was going through von Trier's mind while writing the script. He could've been suicidal as well, if you ask me; but that's none of our business. For me, if someone's using art as a way to cure whatever state of mind he finds himself in, usually what comes out is something 100% genuine and heartfelt, and that's something that I really appreciate.Because of that, the movie is really controversial and complicated. It's open to many interpretations. So I think people that just see it as a gore horror movie fail hard. You can dislike it because of all that disturbing imagery (that could've been avoided very easily but, hey, Lars von Trier was depressed), but you can't, and you shouldn't, avoid looking deep into the movie and its meanings, because it's full of contrived ideas that actually make sense, as sick as they may sound when you find them. History, religion, literature, philosophy, psychology: von Trier took something from everything to create the ideas the main character is based upon. Maybe I'm just a hipster fanboy that's trying really hard to appreciate and to make sense of a movie that's maybe just full of crap. The critics didn't love the movie, neither did the audience (except for, most probably, the horror geeks). So I'm here in between, once again, asking myself: am I reading really hard into a movie that's meant to be read into, therefore doing what I SHOULD (unlike the majority of people who see the movie as shallow), or am I doing all of this pointlessly because I'm just following a delusional director that thinks really highly of himself, therefore wasting my time on fictional nonsense? Well, I think it's the first case.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",Antichrist
129,ihrtfilms,Wow!,10,5 August 2009,"WOW! Like f*ck me WOW! From it's child like crayon writing titles and the stunning black and white opening scenes this had me. Those first scenes were stunning, slowed down so each water drop from the shower was visible, each snowflake could be counted, it was clear this was going to be a film experience to remember. And an experience it was. Graphic, violent, explicit, confronting, stunning, moving, beautiful, visceral...should I go on? This is one the most incredible film experiences I have ever had, which considering the amount of films I have seen, is saying something. Lars Von Trier holds nothing back in his new film and confronts the audience with more than most could ever anticipate. The film follows a couples meltdown after the death of their young son. The mother blames herself and gradually despite her husbands attempts to help her she disintegrates into, something Antichrist like. The first half of the film is quite moving as she grapples with her inner fears and grief. But then all that changes and it descends into something bordering on horror, but this is overwhelmingly graphic horror, with self mutilation and violence which has to be witnessed rather than described. Some of the images and scenes are enough to feel the sell out session recoil in shock and discomfort and a few nervous laughs to boot.The film contain some of the most stunning imagery I've witnessed, the opening slow motion scenes are breathtaking and this use of slow motion is used with great effect throughout the film, with a minimal sound accompaniment they are incredible. The animal imagery is also stunning, yet almost horrific, the deer giving birth, the fox ripped and torn and the crow, the scene where the fox speaks is amazing. These images add a surreal, fantasy like quality to the film which enhances it no end. The scene where they make love against the tree surrounded by protruding hands is beautifully eerie as is the scene of the naked bodies lying in the forest.There is of course the element of grief and despair, esp at the start, which in itself are confronting, due to the intensity of the performances. And it must be said, both Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg are stunning in the roles. The experience of seeing this in a packed out cinema was incredible, the audience was quite gripped by this, there was a lot of groaning and moments of sheer horror throughout, you could sense it. It is to some annoying, that people deal with confronting images with muffled, nervous laughter and there was some of this as well, but oddly no-one I could see walked out. Perhaps for this audience they realized they should see this out, through all the explicit violence and sex and gore. I'm sure there will be many of them that hated it, but like me there will be many others that will dwell on this film experience for a while. It is unlike any Lars Von Trier film I've seen, but one I'm incredibly glad to have witnessed.worldofbitchee.vox.com",Antichrist

132,MairegChernet,"if you're able to get past the visual torture, this shall be a treat.",6,19 June 2012,"Although i don't doubt that this is one of the most disgusting movies anyone would ever see in their lifetime, i believe that Lars von Trier's usage of such explicit cinematography is not without a purpose. What is the purpose of this movie, one might ask? Why show the audience such graphic and presumptuously grotesque images? Well, von Trier's purpose is to explore human emotion, and to do so in such a dramatic and a detailed manner. Thus, the graphic scenes and interactions help him achieve such precision. Antichrist is a movie about a couple whose baby dies as a result of their negligent behavior. The baby falls out a window and plummets to the ground as the couple were having sex in their bedroom. Naturally, the couple are stricken with grief following their toddler's death. The death takes a special toll on the mother who collapses during the funeral and spends months in the hospital.Her husband, who is a therapist, suggests they go to their cabin in the woods (terrible idea) in order to cope with their grief. Their arrival in their cabin home soon turns deadly as the wife slowly loses her mind. Von Trier's depiction of a grief stricken wife is done with so much precision that it makes the audience feel a part of her mourning. The interactions between the anonymous wife and husband have a gloomy and dreary tone. From start to finish, the movie does not seem to convey an ounce of positive energy or optimism. Von Trier's main purpose for this movie to show a couple of things. First, he is showing how much of an impact certain life experiences and emotions can have on the human mind. He takes a basic human experience such as grief and stretches to the absolute extreme. Secondly, Von Trier is showing the evil side of nature. To begin with, it was the couple's natural instinct (sexual urges) that led to their own child's death. Also, the moment they arrive at the cabin, the wife is haunted by the sounds of falling pine cones cricket sounds, resulting in long sleepless nights. The husband also encounters a talking fox who exclaims ""chaos reigns"" in a rather ghastly voice. This proves that nature is not a peaceful and soothing place, as they had assumed it would be. Therefore, Von Trier is suggesting that nature is the ultimate antichrist, a place where all things bad happen. Although i find this to be exceptionally cynical, since i am a nature enthusiast myself, he does have a point. When a person is going through grief and depression (as was the case with the director himself throughout his adult life) nature does seem to be the evil-doer and it loses all its value as a safe and relaxing place. This does not mean nature becomes evil when a person is depressed. It simply means that a person's view of it becomes tainted and that person is only able to see the evil side of it.I can safely say that despite the many disturbing scenes and images, Antichrist is one of the most well-crafted and detailed movies I've ever seen. it might make you stay up all night. You might even walk out in the middle of it. However if you ever decide to sit through the entire thing, I promise it's a movie you won't soon forget.",Antichrist

Pretentious, disgusting, exploitative, cheap, meaningless art-house garbage. The worst kind of art is that which fails to make an impression or sits squarely in a comfort zone. With Antichrist, indifference is not an option. No matter what side of the fence you end up on, this film will provoke a reaction... and that's always the mark of a good film. If you have an open mind and an appreciation for films as a medium of art, one that stretches beyond the bounds of entertainment, you won't regret watching this film. No matter how difficult or draining it may be, it is an uncompromising vision that is provocative, unflinching, and masterfully executed. That's a rarity in cinema these days that shouldn't be missed by those who truly love the medium.",Antichrist
134,bennyhagen,Lars Van Trier tries to put himself on revolutionist territory by showing a dick in slow motion while playing classical music,2,19 May 2011,"I have absolutely no problem with any kind of violence in movies (or with any kind of anything for that matter) if it is used as a tool to reach a certain goal. Haneke has shown us several times how to put intense, realistic violence into movies, to tell us something of meaning. Putting it in just so it's there and some people can go OMG does not verify extremities. Mr. Von Trier uses sex, violence and imagery of genitals with the grace of a slightly disturbed fifteen year old and this whole self-important thing is just right on the intellectual level of such. It is just perfectly complemented by the quality of the dialog and the way the phoney lines are massacred by non native English speaker Charlotte Gainsbourg. The dissonant shots that probably try to make Tarkovskij proud and this movie appear meaningful seem - while looking good - to be bashed in randomly and look like amateur filmmakers experimenting. If the director wants to tell us something he just simply misses the part where you need to do stuff like this in an intelligent manner so it actually makes some sense.I do not see the controversy here. If someone uses extreme tools in a movie to deliver a certain message you can start arguing whether the degree of the extremity was justified or not considering the caliber of the message but this is absolutely not the case here. The sex and violence is not delivering anything besides the potential shocking effect of the images, the message, if there is one at all is unintelligible at best. Where does stuff like this just break down and become stupid bull*hit that someone made up to impress stupid people?If this is serious, Tarkovskij is not impressed.",Antichrist
135,Heislegend,Surprisingly disappointing,5,27 August 2009,"I'm not typically one to go out of my way to watch a movie, any movie, but with all of the talk I'd heard of this movie I felt like I had to seek it out. Plus I'm a fan of Dafoe. I don't like anything and everything he's in, but I've always enjoyed him in it. Perhaps that's the reason I was a bit disappointed by this movie...too much expectation. Or maybe it's the sentiments which I will relay below. Hard to say.First of all, this is a hard movie to watch. Not because of all of the graphic sexualized violence (not to say that said violence is put into a context involving sex like, for instance, a rape, but it's involving genitalia so whatever you want to call it works). If you've seen enough Takashi Miike films, and I have, this doesn't bother you all that much. No, my problem was rather with the pacing and somewhat strange attempts to get a bit art-house with the film. There's a lot of unnecessary slow motion sequences that makes the film feel slower than it already is. And slow...painfully slow almost. The film just seems to drag on for much of it which can (rarely) work for this type of film, but in this case it's just too much.I really wanted to like this movie, and to some extent I did. But in the end I just felt the pacing sucked a lot of the life out of the movie and some of the more ""artistic"" tweaks were not really needed. I thought the acting was very well done but it got caught up in the director's vision of what the film should have been. I'd still recommend it though.",Antichrist
136,eve_dolluk,Post Traumatic stress can be a bitch,7,19 January 2011,"Well I've seen this being described as psychological thriller but there was nothing thrilling about this. It was horrific in the purest most real sense, I'd call it a psychological horror. There is no demons ghosts ghouls or monsters in this film just Humans and our fragile minds. The film was shot very well but most of the credit has to go Defoe and Gainsbourg, they really put themselves out there for this film, literally. I am not sure if body doubles were used for some sections but it came across as all them all the time. There is lots of Symbolism and Metaphor used in this film and some are easier to spot than others especially at the time of watching. I wouldn't say they add or detract anything from the story but they do add to the feeling of the film and also the thought. I have also heard stuff regarding Anti Woman sentiments but only someone very ignorant could watch and see it that way as everything is suggestive and not only to the audience but to the female also. It does highlight anxiety and post traumatic stress in a way that really touched a nerve for me having been and still am a sufferer. The writer must have been through this also as it was so close to home. Luckily for me I never ended up in the woods and didn't choose my partner to be my therapist, there is a lesson to be learnt right there.Overall I didn't enjoy it, not in that sense. I did however have appreciation for the subject matter and thought it was handled well in the context it was trying to portray. It was uncomfortable yet intriguing and the sex scenes were important and a catalyst for the story and emotions of the characters ( of which there is 2 in the entire film characters that is )The one thing i did dislike was the chapter boards that popped up, they were benign pointless and unnecessary. The only one that was maybe needed was the 3 cowards board. Having said that a lot of the film was overindulgent some in a good way and some in a bad way. It lacked something but maybe adding anything else would have made it worse.Worth a watch if u like psychological stuff and if you want to watch something uncomfortable that will make u squirm ( yes both male and female ) Oh and did I mention the performances of Defoe and Gainsbourg, watch it for that alone.7/10",Antichrist

I could see what he was trying to do but unfortunately he failed - and did so miserably. First, the beginning and middle parts of the movie meant to set up the final chapter were so slow and boring I almost gave up. The rest of this insanity was meant to shock the viewer into submission but instead came across as absolutely ridiculous. Clearly she was attempting to drag him into Hell with her but frankly I didn't care what happened to him. By the time the credits rolled the only emotion I felt was anger.

138,TheAnimalMother,A Beautifully Breaded Cheese Sandwich!,3,2 November 2009,"Hmm...where does one start with a film such as this? Well let me say that this film contains some great unique imagery. However, it doesn't contain much more worth noting. While the Prologue and Epilogue are fantastic, all that is sandwiched in between is a story that eventually goes off in a completely groundless direction. The film also has some terribly cheesy and unrealistic dialogue that seems ridiculously misplaced to put it mildly. I'm not sure I have ever seen such a terrible film, that has such a great beginning and ending. The chaos or nature is evil association that some give to ground the direction this film takes is just not sufficient. Though it tries to disguise itself, the film quite clearly goes off in a cash grab shock horror style that is sure to make it a taboo legend of sorts, rather than delve into the true depths of its subject matter and become a classic. This film is definitely no Irrevisible, and certainly only wishes it could touch something as truly deep and darkly thought provoking as A Clockwork Orange.I would advise most people to not even bother watching this film unless you are a huge fan of the director, Dafoe, or of sexual gore type scenes. If you are a film student, I would recommend a viewing just for the Prologue and Epilogue. This film certainly does have an artistically visual aspect worth seeing if film work is your profession or goal. The ending is clearly the best part of the film as far as the story goes (The absence of dialogue definitely helps its cause, comparatively to the rest of the film). Otherwise, don't waste your time; Just make yourself a nice sandwich with cheese to enjoy, and know that your sandwich is far better than this empty cheese sandwich.3/10",Antichrist

140,starlit-sky,Lars von Trier should stop making movies,4,2 October 2010,"I hate it when directors try so hard to be artistic it comes off as pathetic attempt. Lars von Trier is one of the most superfluous directors of his time. His previous movies ""Dogville"" and ""Manderlay"" were basically theatrical plays. Filming a theatrical play like a movie is somehow supposed to be original and artistic? This movie begins with black and white slow-motion shots of a couple making love when their baby crawls out of his crib and makes it to the window and finally falling to his demise. The shots are long in slow-motion topped with a classic opera score. After this, it cuts to the funeral procession. We see mother grieving and she is traumatized by what happened.Then the couple decides to take a trip to the mountains to get away from it all and try to come to terms with what happened. The movie is very slow. This could have been easily a 40 minute TV episode. There are only 2 characters husband and wife; husband is trying to analyze the psychology of wife who blames herself for what happened.Towards the ACt 3, the conclusion, we get a clearer picture of the psychology of the wife; she has been in that cabin before for a research; she studied the medieval concept of woman being evil. And the audience is left with a question of whether she actually let her baby die intentionally or if she lost her mind and only thinks she did. Either way, the movie is way too stretched out and takes forever to get to the point. Like Dogville and Manderlay, this could have stayed as a theatrical play. That's why I think Lars Von Trier should stop making movies and get into the theater. His artistic vision is not cut out for motion pictures.",Antichrist
141,the_rattlesnake25,A film everybody should at least experience 5 minutes of...,5,9 January 2010,"Lars von Trier's most recent release 'Antichrist' was collared with notoriety before it was even released theatrically, during its premiere screening at the Cannes Film Festival it was reported that allegedly three or four film critics fainted at the graphic scenes of sex and mutilation. So was it worth it? Has the Danish Dogme King made another 'anti-masterpiece'? Well, the answer isn't quite as simple as saying that 'Antichrist' was a good film or a bad film; it's an incredibly complex creation that will certainly divide viewers of cinema alike.Willem Dafoe is He and Charlotte Gainsbourg is She. During the opening prologue we are shown the sequence which sends both characters in differentiating spirals of grief, the sequence in question is the accidental death of their young child. The scene is spectacularly shot in black and white and slow-motion, with a haunting classical score accompanying the scene. As He and She make passionate love in bathroom, there child climbs out of his crib and accidentally falls to his death out of the buildings top floor window. He then decides to take She to a cabin in the woods, after the funeral, which He believes is her greatest fear, and the central aspect that is fuelling her catatonic state of grief and her inability to put the sadness of the death of their child behind them.From here on in we are taken on a cinematic journey through four different chapters in the films structure. Staring with 'Grief', we then go follow through to 'Pain' and 'Despair', before culminating with the final chapter of the 'Three Beggars' and the inevitable and beautifully shot Epilogue. The basic themes encountered within these are gynocide, sadness, guilt and the provocation of the audience through extreme graphic sequences of on-screen mutilation and violence (Including the now notorious female genital maiming sequence and the act of bloody and violent masturbation of an incapacitated male).While completely losing himself at times in a sea of arrogance and self-consciousness, Von Trier's 'Anti-Christ' does have its moments of beautiful, yet bleak tranquilly. After all, if you take away the controversial sequences of violence and talking animals, the central theme of the film is simply the sadness, grief and inability to cope with the loss of a loved one and how male and female counterparts may handle the situation differently in their own ways.Coupled with some striking cinematography, this film is more of an experience than anything else. I don't actually fully understand everything that Von Trier is trying to explore within this world, but I can certainly admire it.",Antichrist
142,mfisher452,"Let Lars von Trier, by all means, write a screenplay as therapy...",2,1 December 2010,"but does that necessarily mean he should film it and charge admission? This is another of the products of the fertile but loosely bolted brain of Lars von Trier. Don't be misled by the title: There's minimum religion and maximum unpleasant sex. There are really only two characters, He and She, played by Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg, who are both outstanding actors although I've always found Gainsbourg's overbite a bit distracting. He is a psychotherapist, though not a very convincing one, and it sounds like She started but never finished a doctorate that had something to do with the ""nature"" of women in art.The movie consists of a prologue, four chapters, and an epilogue. It opens with a shower scene. Let's be candid here: Doesn't sex in the shower look a lot more fun in the movies or on TV than it really is? In real life, the water can be distracting, the shower walls and floor are hard and slippery, and the person who isn't right under the shower head quickly gets cold and shivery. Nevertheless, movie directors seem to love shower scenes. In this one, while He and She are having extremely rough and extremely explicit sex in the shower, their toddler son falls out of a window of their 4th-floor apartment and is killed. She becomes psychotic with grief and guilt. After a couple of months, He becomes dissatisfied with Her psychiatrist, takes Her off Her medications and attempts to treat Her as a patient. Big mistake. That alone indicates how misguided and stupid He is. The doctor who doctors himself has a fool for a patient. This also goes for doctors' families. He tries various forms of talking therapy, without much success. Maybe He is unsuccessful because it's obvious that He is a really inept therapist. These scenes are totally unrealistic. In an attempt to repair Their seriously damaged relationship, They retreat to ""Eden,"" which is their extremely rustic cabin that is so far back in the woods that They have to hike quite a ways from the car to get there. Unfortunately, things go from bad to worse. There is a lot of disjointed, incomprehensible plot development that goes nowhere. She seems to sink deeper into madness: There's no other explanation for Her completely illogical behavior, which as written by von Trier is so random and implausible that even madness cannot account for it. He has strange hallucinatory experiences involving talking animals and whispering winds. He becomes increasingly alarmed at Her apparent obsession with the supposed demonic principle in the female nature. In the half-light of the deep woods or the dim lamplight of the cabin, as this hour-and-48-minute film drags on, He and She degenerate into essentially meaningless psychological ""exercises,"" very graphic and unarousing sadomasochistic sex, violence, masturbation, mutilation and self-mutilation, figurative immolation, a full-Monty autoclitoridectomy with scissors that is guaranteed to make your skin crawl whichever sex you are (""Is this really necessary?"" you ask yourself), and, finally, strangulation.It's one thing to force yourself to watch a documentary about the Nazi concentration camps, or Taliban atrocities, or what happens in a slaughterhouse, but should you force yourself to sit through a film like ""Antichrist"" just because you've got this notion that if Lars von Trier created these images, they must be worth watching? Maybe this film is too arcane and sophisticated for me. Or maybe it is, to paraphrase Shakespeare, a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing. Maybe all the brutal, savage imagery and symbolism really is in the service of great cinematic art; on the other hand, maybe all the brutal, savage imagery and symbolism is merely in the service of the creator's self-indulgence, which is what I saw on the screen. Will this film stand the test of time? You be the judge---that is, if you're in a masochistic mood or are an insomniac looking for a desperation-time diversion.",Antichrist
143,Magenta_Bob,Antichrist,10,9 July 2013,"Ever since I saw Antichrist back in 2010, I've been reluctant to see it again in fear of it not holding up; the first time was like a punch in the stomach as the film had an almost physical effect on me. I remember seeing the notoriously provocative and shocking A Serbian Film around the same time, and thinking that it didn't disturb me nearly as much even though the visual nastiness is on par if not worse. The reason I think is that with Antichrist, Lars von Trier does not just shock the audience visually, but manages to create an emotionally troubling piece of work with a suffocating atmosphere from start to finish, which almost always wins out for me.Antichrist is by far the most visceral film I've seen by von Trier up to that point (how it compares in that respect to at least the opening and closing of subsequent Melancholia is debatable I suppose). For most of the running time, there's an incredible soundscape of drones and hisses running in the background that genuinely feels like evil caught on tape. Visually, the film is littered with creepy imagery such as the recurring acorn rain and shots of birds eating each other (as well as much worse things). While Antichrist looks much more lavish than previous films, the slightly shaky camera is still there to bring intensity and give a feeling of presence. The brilliant Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg do just as much to create atmosphere with their subdued and (in the latter case) anxiety-ridden performances.I've always thought that the talk about von Trier's films being misogynist have been quite misguided. Somewhat troublesomely, a lot of nasty things happens to his female protagonists in movies like Dogville and Dancer in the Dark, but at no point have I felt like he has sided against them. Antichrist is admittedly a bit more in the grey area, as a lot of dialogue is explicitly about the evil of women, but to me it still comes across more like an extrapolation of Charlotte Gainsbourg's character's self-hatred, much like the whole thing about the film taking place in the woods is a way to give the theme of the nature of evil a physical form. Moreover, while von Trier does play into stereotypical gender roles by having Willem Dafoe play the rational, emotionally stable party, he is also the catalyst of the evil by making strange decision like bringing his wife out into the woods which she is so afraid of.Evidently there are a lot of symbolical things going on in Antichrist. But much like the ""glib"" contents of Gainsbourg's thesis, von Trier does not necessarily present a coherent argument, but rather throws out a series of themes and ideas and leaves up to the viewer to decide what sticks. You could delve into the films exploration of evil, nature, the nature of evil and how we are evil by nature. You could read as much as you like into the fact that the characters are only archetypically referred to as she and he and that they go to visit ""the garden of Eden"" – is it perhaps about the birth of evil? Do their sin (of giving into lust) from the prologue give way to the three beggars of grief, pain and despair from which death must follow? Or, perhaps most appropriately, you could just see it as a mood piece to be experienced rather than thought, and as such one of the most unsettling and affecting films I have seen. Three years later, I am happy to say that Antichrist packs the same punch.",Antichrist
144,shinsrevenge,That's why you need safewords!,7,26 July 2018,"What a strange, disturbing movie. I don't know the actress, but Willem Dafoe shines in what seems to be some sort of low budget production. At first it focuses on his attempts to treat her pain/shock over their lost child. He knows what he's doing and I found the different approaches for therapy and the talk about it interesting and insightful.Then the movie takes a sharp turn into the supernatural and occult. Sex, death, mutilation, torture (not in this order). Some scenes were extreme enough that I had to avert my gaze. Like the rest of the movie, they are very detailed - even thought I doubt if that's necessarily a plus.
The way the movie deals with the ""evil"" is innovative. Is nature evil? Or is evil acting the way it does because that's its nature, its instict? Or was it all just a shared hallucination and the result of the traumatic event the couple had gone through - some sort of ""folie a deux""?That's open for speculation and it left me with some questions and thoughts. And while I probably wouldn't want to watch this movie again, at least not anytime soon, I can say that it felt worthwhile and ""entertaining"" in its own, bizarre way.",Antichrist
145,celr,The symbolism of torture?,1,29 November 2010,"Others have described this movie as torture porn--if only the repulsive torture scenes had any erotic overtones this film might have had some meager purpose in arousing jaded sociopaths who can't get off any other way. As it is, it is just a useless piece of Eurodreck, a badly organized hate-filled blast of rage against moviegoers in general. None of the fake symbolism justifies the crude, slapdash Frankenstein monster of a plot that lurches along for way too long, finally self-destructing in a paroxysm of violence.There are many reviews here and though that should be enough, I felt so strongly about the awfulness of ""Antichrist"" that I had to add my voice to those who absolutely hated it in order to bend the approval curve down. I guess too many people are taken in by the arty patina, the extreme slo-mo shots in black and white (with a Bach aria playing in the background.)There was an art movement in the last decades of the 20th century in which the artist would place a pile of bricks, or a bottle of urine, or a can of cat food in a museum and by virtue of it being in a museum it would automatically (it was claimed) become art. This nonsense of course, which was charming in the days of Duchamp, had become by the 1970s exercises in the grotesque and perverse. Now we have it in film. A steaming pile of manure on the museum floor for which the director claims the title of ""art."" In order to reinforce the notion of 'art' the film is full of contrived symbolism. The husband, a modern day Pentheus, (Defoe) in a misguided attempt to treat his depressed wife as a patient, takes her to the woods, a place she says she fears, in order to get her to face and conquer her hangups. Bad mistake. The wife (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is far sicker than he imagines and under the unwelcome stress of the leafy environment becomes totally insane. He should have had her locked up, but too late now. What happens next is described in other reviews. If you don't know by now, you don't want to know. One thing they didn't emphasize enough was how painfully slow-moving this film is. Most of the time Gainsbourg speaks in a whisper which is extremely difficult to make out. What we are given to understand is that Nature is Evil, and that Woman, being closer to Nature, is the embodiment of Evil. Gainsbourg's character certainly becomes very evil by the end of the picture. I get the impression that the ""Antichrist"" in this film is meant to be the wife in particular and all females in general. Horror films are meant to be fun, at least on some level. They present a scary world, where evil can often triumph, but this scary, fictional world is not to be taken seriously. Horror flicks should scare you without injuring you. Deranged hillbillies, the walking dead, sexy vampires, and noises in the basement are fun-scary. This overrated gore fest is no fun at all and may very well injure your mind should you choose to ignore the warnings and see it anyway. Yes, it is ""disturbing."" Well isn't real art supposed to be ""disturbing""? That would mean that anything that makes you want to loose your lunch is 'art.' What rubbish. But the only thing this movie symbolized to me was the decadence of a collapsing civilization, that as Europe collapses economically, it is also collapsing culturally. That's what ""Antichrist"" symbolized to me.",Antichrist

I saw this on the big screen a few months ago. I wonder how many will watch it the next few weeks with instant streaming? Lars von Trier: A couple lose their young son when he falls out the window while they have sex in the other room. The mother's grief consigns her to hospital, but her therapist husband brings her home intent on treating her depression himself. To confront her fears they go to stay at their remote cabin in the woods, ""Eden"", where something untold happened the previous summer. Told in four chapters with a prologue and epilogue, the film details acts of lustful cruelty as the man and woman unfold the darker side of nature outside and within Gainsboug won the Best Actress at Cannes. Called the most depressing & despairing movie ever made the overall tone is very dreadful but really this is more of an allegory fantasy. It is hollow shocker of a movie and is is a cinematic con trick pulled on the more credulous sections of the art-house audience & on the media that bark en masse at von Trier's goading. Film is a willfully boring & pretentious narrative. The scandal of ""Antichrist"" is not that it is grisly or upsetting but that it is so ponderous, so conceptually thin & so dull. Beautiful fantastic allegory but very boring. I like Variety's view ""a big fat art-film fart- the artiness quotient is far too high for mainstream"" Gainsbourg in her character tell it like it is ""None of this is any use at all."" Film has no redeeming artistic value or merit. Watch at your own risk--no not really just don't watch at all. The film never rises to the symbolic; the allegory angle is a piece of crap. There is a beauty to the film that can be seductive. The only interesting part of the movie is the cinematography. The film has a gorgeous, mesmerizing construction, and almost every one of its frames shines with demento, fairy tale unnaturalness. Anthony Dod Mantle makes incredible use of two new hi-def digital cameras, the Red and the Phantom.) The film is more of a realistic narrative cinema than anything von Trier has made in a long time. But the narrative is so pretentious. (I say all this being a truly great fan of Von Trier's films-- Element of Crime, Breaking Waves, and Dancer in the Dark. (I recommend them highly). I look forward to the new film by new Gaspar Noe ( I am sure I will get something profound from his movie) and I look forward to viewing my 3 favorite Von Trier films again. Regarding the AntiChrist; it is rare that I find myself truly indifferent to a film. The film has no artistic integrity, intellectual rigor or emotional significance. The film is a shame and a sham - for Gainsbourg and Dafoe, but especially the filmmaker. Von Trier made this film in a state of deep depression and you will probably join him if you view this film. The film is interesting, but only briefly, as an act of confession. In subject matter and theme it reminded me a lot of Bergman (and through him, Strindberg), particularly the sense that men and women are different species and heterosexual relationships in general and marriage in particular is a battleground of opposing forces. The film is experimental, shocking and pessimistic. This film covers the whole gamut of art-house clichés and none of them work. However Von Trier has strengthened his own infant terrible reputation. This type of storytelling has afforded him a long career of polarizing successes. Von Trier dedicated this film to Russian film director Andrei Tarkovsky. Tarkovsky was in Rome 1980 the pre-production of the film Nostalghia, and noted in his diary that Federico Fellini's film City of Women was a fiasco: ""At the Cannes Festival the papers said that Fellini's last film was a total disaster, and that he himself had ceased to exist. It's terrible, but it's true, his film is worthless."" Feb 26 2010 noted film critic dfwforeignbuff writes that he agrees but in regards to Von Trier and his film Antichrist: ""VonTrier's last film was a total disaster, and that he himself had ceased to exist. It's terrible, but it's true, his film is worthless"" I rate this film Antichrist 2 stars",Antichrist

The plot and characters are ignored to help the symbolic value of the film.That's fine. 2001 and Halloween do the exact same thing. No problem there.The problem is though the plot is as fallows, a married couple trying to deal with the death of their child slowly fall apart and try in the end to kill each other. That means that the plot at its heart should be a character drama.The problem is, the characters of this film aren't characters, but symbolic props used to make a comment. They don't even have names! This means that ALL of their actions are random(everything they do is only to help the theme and makes no sense plot wise). As such, they don't come off as real people.The girl character attacks the man character for no reason. None. She just does so to do so. As such, you find the characters impossible to relate to and the entire film falls apart.The end result is a film that feels slow and you can't connect with. Do to not connecting with it it's impossible to find the film disturbing or graphic. It only feels disjointed and pointless.The only way one could enjoy the film is if they read a book before seeing the film saying what the theme of the film was. That though makes the film pointless. I would rather just read the book.",Antichrist

If anything, the critics were too kind with this one. While von Trier's visual aesthetic is as keen as ever, his emotional compass is so out of kilter that I can't imagine who would find this movie remotely enjoyable. The characters are fatuous and/or implausible even by von Trier's standards, and the plot, such as it is, could fit on an index card. I wasn't surprised to learn that von Trier was suffering from severe depression while making Antichrist. That's no excuse for inflicting it on everyone else.",Antichrist
152,lumieretrain,Antichrist by Lars von Trier,7,20 June 2019,"Horror stories about one or few characters go to an isolated place, to get a relaxed holiday or even to get through a tragedy are one of the most interesting stories to tell. To see how these stories would get through, until the characters would face the nightmare. Some of these nightmare scenarios can be inspired, by some of the greatest films, books or even poetries. To create unforgettable poetic scenes in every single angle shots, which are helped by dark gothic atmospheres and particular lightenings. Without let the characters be prepared, of which consequences they would face. Some of these consequences can get, to the death of one or even of all the characters. The auteur filmmaker Lars von Trier has been interested to explore this theme, by getting inspired his experience of depression. In 2009 came out Antichrist by Lars von Trier with Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg. The movie's plot: A grieving married couple (Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg) lost their child, while they were making passionate love in the night. The couple decides to go to a cabin in the woods, by hoping they would get through the tragedy. But the nature would make the couple live in a nightmare, through violent and dark consequences. One of the most interesting parts of Antichrist, is how the couple try to get through the pain, until something dark would make things unexpectedly worse. The story is told in the following chapters: Prologue, Grief, Pain (Chaos Reigns), Despair (Gynocide), The Three Beggars and Epilogue. In the Prologue would be seen how the couple's sorrow started, by capturing the audience attention. In the Grief would be seen how the couple go to the cabin, then something dark starts to look suspicious. In Pain (Chaos Reigns) would be seen how everything seems to get better, until the darkness makes clear how everything is getting into a nightmare. In Despair (Gynocide) would be seen how the nightmare does not have mercy with the couple, as they are living in the darkness filled with fear and guilt. In The Three Beggars would be seen the consequence of the couple, without having a happy faith but instead to have a shocking and violent faith. Finally in the Epilogue would be seen the aftermath of the previous chapter, as the nightmare ended and let the audience ask the meaning of the last scene. The movie uses strong violent images to shock the audience, without let them be ready for what they are going to see. Some of the scariest scenes of Antichrist are atmospherically dark, to be unforgettable in every shocking angle shots. The score by Kristian Eidnes Andersen uses dark sounds, to immediately scare the audience's ears. But in the same way, some of the scenes where shot like poetic paintings to capture the audience attention. Especially in the Prologue and the Epilogue which were also helped, by the aria of Lascia Ch'io Pianga by Georg Friedrich Händel, to make the scenes dramatically poetic. Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg were really good as the grieving couple, who would be not ready by anything once they arrive at the cabin in the woods. Antichrist is one of the most darkest, scariest and poetic movies by Lars von Trier.",Antichrist

The best precedent is Leni Riefenstahl, who at least had the merit of being innovative. Lars Von Trier is anything but.Directors such as Imamura, Miike, and Polanski have used material which resembles the current film either graphically or thematically. But the statements of those other directors are not as vile as Von Trier's.This writer can discern two major themes in this film: first, that nature is evil, second, that women are the mothers of evil. The first is debatable, the second is obscene.Von Trier had the effrontery to dedicate this graphic horror to the memory of Andrei Tarkovsky, a true artist and a true humanist.

159,montferrato,Women as Carriers of Evil,7,7 May 2015,"I am not particularly fond of Lars Von Trier. However, I decided to watch this movie and I was pleasantly surprised. I could finish the movie, which is good for starters, and felt genuine interest during the whole movie. While I dislike the prologue and epilogue for their pretentiousness, as they are filmed in a too crisp, neat, calculated and deliberate ""Christmas Artsy Advert"", there is to admit that the film keeps you seated in the chair with a feeling of overbearing discomfort and sometimes even fear. It is indeed a movie that throws in the mix lots of psychological elements and concepts on purpose, and tries deliberately to confuse you, make you think, and always try to convey an ulterior meaning too high to be fully comprehended. This pretentiousness is what I do not like in the movie. The rest is pretty good, and it does not disappoint. It must be said that this movie is not for those who like movies with a clear end, plot and script. The movie is deliberately obscure, dense, and confusing. There are also high doses of violence and also some hard-core explicit sex, and even scenes of mutilation involving genitalia. So, if you are easily offended, you should not watch it. If you like strange, cult-like European movies, you will enjoy it. It is not a masterpiece as many have said, and it is not rubbish, as others have suggested. The truth is somewhere in between, and my opinion is that this movie is definitely worth watching. I found the movie to be entertaining, and also makes you think about some unpleasant ideas and feelings. It must be said that the photography and music are quite good, and the interpretations of Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsburg are excellent. It must not have been easy for the actors to follow the orders of Von Trier and involve themselves in such a crazy plot. 10 out of 10 for the interpreters. As for the movie, what is it all about??? Willem Dafoe is a nameless therapist with anti-Freudian ideas married to some sort of nameless researcher in religion or anthropology or sociology (Charlotte Gainsburg), and the pair has a child who commits suicide by jumping from a window in a snowy winter night, with the intention to better see how snowflakes fall. While the child commits suicide, the parents are making love mechanically and brutally, and the child sees it. Did he feel unloved??? After the death of the child, the woman has a crisis, and they go to a lost cabin in the woods called ""Eden"", where a crazy drama with some surreal and supernatural dream-like events happen. Women are basically classified as carriers and transmitters of Evil, and Nature is equated to evil, being women nothing more than beings under the control of nature (Evil, Satan, according to the movie). Lots of ideas and nasty concepts are exposed and thrown to us. It is for you to see if some of it resonates with you or not. The film has indeed a misogynist tone, or at least misanthropic. My recommendation is: watch it by yourself by night, and have an open mind. You may like it or not, but probably it won't leave you indifferent.",Antichrist

It seems that, nowadays human relationships are based in Money or in Sex, Sometimes both. To me, it means, that the ""so called"" Artists, are no longer able to create ""Works of Art"". God's solution is to burn those Bastards. Since ""Sodom & Gomorrah"", thru the Inquisition, there is a need to ""PURGE"" humanity from ""bad thought"". This is best done by fire. And Lars Von Trier is my first candidate. Not that he is the worse, by far, but because he attempts to give ""cultural credibility"" to what is an ""old cinema GENRE"", Horror.Horror Movies have always existed. They were designed to frigthen people in ""order to behave = become normal"". This movie purposes the Opposite. Go to Hell, Lars..",Antichrist
161,binaryg,"Antichrist; Art in the ""I"" of the Beholder",10,20 November 2009,"I drove 150 miles this week to see Antichrist in the theater. I didn't want to have to wait for its DVD release. Since seeing it I have not been able to get the film out of my mind. I expected to be blown away and I certainly was. It is not an easy film to watch but what it demonstrates about the nature of Nature and the World is not easily found. For a film which is playing in 12 theaters nation wide the amount of comment on Antichrist is amazing. There are almost 200 external reviews at IMDb and many user reviews. As usual with von Trier films many of the reactions are extreme. Some love it, some hate it. I can see how the film engenders such passionate response.Antichrist does for the forest what the Shining did for hotels. So now on my morning walk through a nearby wood I see deer and crows and I expect to see a talking fox. I celebrate the fact that von Trier has made such an uncompromising film. He shows us how the decomposition of Nature and Natural things is paralleled by the deconstruction of humanity and human relationships. Most of the world wants to ignore what is happening every day in the world, the continuing war and destruction of the planet. Antichrist forces those who are willing to sit through the film to face some of the things that are happening. The story that von Trier was so depressed while making the film that he had to turn the cinematography over to someone else is revealing.Willem Defoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg deserve the accolades they have received for their work on the film. Defoe played Christ, in The Last Temptation and now comes full circle. (The question of who the Antichrist is in this film is not easily answered and is subject to opinion some saying it's She, some He, some Nature.) Some comments I've read about He feel he's controlling and overly rational from the very beginning. I thought he was caring, concerned, and compassionate in the beginning but then made bad decision after bad decision for She. Like Jack Torrance, He, falls under the spell of his surroundings and is incapable of being any thing but destructive. And She does everything she can to bring about her own destruction because there is, obviously, no other possible ending.As I read in a user comment, von Trier has the ability to polarize his audience and the extreme reactions are to be expected. As IMDb user, McHenry observed, ""The only way to insult this movie is with indifference.""",Antichrist
162,maatmouse-1,Unsettling study in a couple's grief from Lars,5,20 October 2009,"For all of those who have read about this film's 'shocking' moments, I would say 'grow up'. There's much worse out there and just as unsettling.Lars Von Trier is not a director I'm THAT familiar with. I have heard much hype about him and his work with actresses like Nicole Kidman and Bryce Dallas Howard. As with many European directors, there is always a big cultural difference between them and the Americans. Much of it centres on the use of sex and the depiction of it in European films.There is some sex in this film. Its quite graphic. If you don't want to spend the first five minutes of this film squirming in your seat or if you're uncomfortable with aroused genitalia then don't bother with this one. In two moments in the film, aroused male genitalia is viewed and female genitalia. Lars assures us that it is not Willem Dafoe's penis or Charlotte Gainsbourg's genitals on display but it is some unknown porn stars body-doubling. Fair enough. It is not as if this hasn't been done before, particularly in Nine Songs.What is truly unsettling about this film is not the sex but the painful study in human misery that this film is really about. It is essentially about a father and a mother's need and exploration of their grief. The cause of their grief is the death by falling from a window of their very young son whilst they were energetically having sex. The film chronicles their grief and their emotional reactions to each other over the chapters in the film, played out in the family home, at first and then later on, in a cabin in the woods.What makes it more interesting is that Dafoe is acting as a sort of ad-hoc therapist to his wife's suffocating grief. As expected, she blames herself then questions him, then undergoes all the physical processes of grief, hyperventilating, panic attacks, shaking and crying. It is Dafoe's character who tries to help her ride all this out.When they finally decide to head into the woods, things go from bad to worse. Now the couple are in a capsule situation. It is just themselves, no-one else is involved. Charlotte's character's intense grief turns into increasingly irrational behaviour. Her character sleeps for long periods, writes unusual things in a book and begins to become more violent. At one stage, after being rejected by her husband, she attacks him with a wooden block, causing him much pain in a particularly horrid way. Then she does something extra-ordinary. To prevent him leaving her as she sees it, she drills a hole in his lower leg and pushes the spindle of a grinding wheel, effectively attaching this heavy tool to his leg as a kind of iron. Then again, she retreats into herself, mutilating her body in a particularly unpleasant manner.As a study in grief, this film is shocking and very potent. There are no holds barred with it, but then grief is not a cosy experience. For nearly all of us, who will experience it at some point in our lives, it is a very humbling and raw emotion. Von Trier is using film to illustrate just how raw it can be. For such a film, there are no cosy happy endings.",Antichrist
163,lucas_mrz,Strange,6,10 October 2015,"If you are familiarized with Von Trier work,don't even read this,you know what you will find. I will write this review as i always do(or try to),objective and short. I'll put away my opinion and taste as much as i can,so this can be useful for you. First of all,in this movie you will find gore and explicit sex(really explicit),so if you don't like that,discard it. This is a slow but well done movie,with a strange plot(it's not a classic horror movie). It has good acting,a good atmosphere and succeed on deliver tension and some shocking moments.The epilogue is not very clear(i actually don't know what the director tried to show),the rest of the movie follows a logic and it's not incomprehensible(plus you have to remember that a lot of abnormal things can happen in a horror movie).

165,jackharding89-1,A gruelling tale of mythical grandeur,8,22 December 2009,"An eerie yet gorgeous tapestry of lingering close-ups; parallels, cuts and slow-motion photography, Lars Von Trier's Antichrist is a gruelling tale of mythical grandeur: a bizarre yet beautiful film chock full of sadism and shagging, Satanic dogma and similes. Most of which, I don't understand. So you'll be pleased to know that I have no intention of harping on about the director's bent meditation on gender, nature, genocide, motherhood, misogyny and astronomy. I find all that stuff interesting, don't get me wrong, but when things get Freudian I'm way out of my league. Therefore, I'll stick to what I know.Albeit seething with emotion, Antichrist refuses to adhere to some of the general ""rules"" of the classical Hollywood narrative, meaning it lacks clarity, unity and closure. For example, there're only two characters, both of which remain nameless and have indefinite; pasts, motives and are somewhat difficult to identify with. The film rejects conventional morality. It is a difficult and uncomfortable experience that'll unnerve even the most robust of film fans. So if you like your films light, clear and conservative, stay away. If, however, you're a fan of, say, Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now, director David Lynch or you just dig a bit of alternative cinema, then brace yourself for a hugely demanding tableau that film critic Anita Singh of the Sunday Telegraph dubbed ""the most shocking film in the history of the Cannes Film Festival."" Willem Dafoe plays ""he"", a therapist and husband to ""she"" (Charlotte Gainsbourg), the female half of the cast whose line of work we never really learn. After a quite miraculous opening montage that juxtaposes the couple making love with the accidental death of their child, the embedded tale follows the pair as they flee to ""Eden"", their isolated cabin in the woods, where ""he"" attempts to aid a severely grief stricken ""she"" through her bereavement.Book-ended by a masterfully conceived prologue and epilogue and split into four focal chapters entitled ""Grief"", ""Pain"", ""Despair"" and ""The Three Beggars"" (don't ask), the film takes on a ghostlike tone from the outset as the boundaries between the real and surreal become blurred. Alas, things get weird, edgy and very, very nasty. The sheer mass and rate of dense motifs and metaphors at hand regarding sex, Freud, the devil and the soul is a little overwhelming. Not to mention the force and intensity of both Dafoe and Gainsbourg's turns in addition to the film's strong, emotional undercurrent.In spite of large and sustained periods of quite brilliant film-making, Antichrist contains some of the most violent and deplorable images ever committed to celluloid. For the ladies there's self mutilation. For the gents there'sI, I, I can't even say it. Put it this way, it ain't good ladsAnyway, add to the unthinkable gore a whole host of outlandish set-ups, half a dozen scenes of a sexual nature and one or two jolts in tone and you'll be scared silly. Remember- sometimes in cinema, you fear what you don't understand, especially when the camera is an unflinching eye inside the head of a disturbed, Danish poet. Lars Von Trier is an excellent filmmaker, but even his biggest fans will find it hard to swallow this, never mind stomach it.Dedicated to the memory of legendary soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky, Antichrist is truly as haunting, delicate and poetic a film as you're ever bound to see. Though shrouded in scenes of unspeakable cruelty, the film eludes to the work of Tarkovsky in a big way: Von Trier's warped Adam and Eve parable is a moody, metaphysical affair cloaked in hypnotic, dreamlike imagery that calls to mind the likes of Mirror, Solaris and the brilliant Stalker. The trancelike photography; sound, score, and editing demonstrate a predilection for atmospheric, art-theatre sensibility. Tarkovsky would have loved it. This, after all, is a film that simply has to be seen to be believed. Not necessarily for its aesthetic grandeur, gore or technique, but for its harrowing portrayal of a soul in torment.What's it all about? Who cares?! Antichrist is an unusual, atmospheric horror film that's guaranteed to provoke. The performances are honest and strong, the aesthetics are bold, the direction is brilliant and the outcome is something that is ultimately hard to come by these days: authentic film-making.Jack Harding",Antichrist
166,thesubstream,It's by leaps and bounds the most beautifully lit and shot film that I've seen in years.,9,13 November 2009,"A husband and wife (Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg as He and She) suffer a loss. Their child falls from a window while they have sex in another room, and the wife enters a deep depression. After a month in the hospital, the husband, a therapist, tells his wife that he's suspicious of the quality of therapeutic care that she's receiving, and takes her home to treat her, himself He favours ""exposure therapy"", and suggests they spend a week away, seeking catharsis at what she identifies as the source of her greatest fear: a cabin in the woods, called ""Eden"". From there, Lars von Trier's Antichrist gets a little nuts. He is the perfect caricature of rational male competency, She is the self-loathing, cruel embodiment of decay and violent entropy. They battle, they inflict shocking (a word not used lightly in 2009 when referring to the state of the movie-making world), brutal and explicit violence on each other and themselves. Nature is revealed to be satanic, empty and ill-willed. Chaos reigns.It's a film carefully concocted and designed to polarize its audience, massively and baldly anti-woman, on its face. The film played at Cannes this year, and received a special ""anti-award"" from the Ecumenical Jury that recognized it as ""the most misogynist movie from the self-proclaimed biggest director in the world"". It's a pyrrhic form of provocation by Von Trier – to assume that any of the woman's actions in the film can be ascribed to sincere opinions being expressed by a filmmaker working from ""the heart"" is on reflection pretty silly. He's playing at misogynist, he's disingenuously donning the why-would-anyone-want-it mantle of brave male artist speaking against female wickedness, to bring down the furor upon himself, and make his critics like the Ecumenical jury look ridiculous to those in-the-know enough to realize Antichrist is a put-on, a ""troll"", someone casting a rod into the sea of churning opprobrium looking for a bite. At least I hope it is.Aside from that, the film is a glory. It's by leaps and bounds the most beautifully lit and shot film that I've seen in years. There are a handful of remarkably well-executed shots, camera moves and scenery that combine to be literally breath-taking, coldly deft and chilling all the more so coming from the director that helped bring us the daffy, muddy aesthetic of Dogme 95. Dafoe and Gainsbourg are both spectacular, Gainsbourg in particular as the yo-yoing, dangerous wife able to go from pathetic to snarling and stalking the forest in a heartbeat. Dafoe's He is subjected repeatedly to the incomprehensible assaults of raw nature, and he is able to transmute the ridiculous – a talking, self-disembowelling fox – into something estranging, something sublimely terrifying. Where von Trier (seemingly) set out to make a polarizing political and sexual drama, he has succeeded in the related goal of making a profoundly chilling horror film, one that invents its own grammar and masters its frame and everything in it with such complete command that its hyperviolence, misogyny and gratuitous excess (I am not exaggerating) is transformed into a deeply othering, eldritch weirdness, a perfect placid wrongness, and one of the best films of the year.",Antichrist
167,nunoaraujoduarte,movieinthepark.blogspot.com,6,8 November 2011,"Four times the bible refers to the Antichrist, all of them in the Epistles of John. He keeps advising humanity that Antichrists are coming, but he defines them to be the ones who believe that Jesus Christ was not the son of God. I believe Christians defend that Antichrist is the symbol of sin, he who provides every man's which, except his salvation. This last point really applies for this Lars Von Trier's movie. Willem Daffoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg represent male and female sides of Man, very victimised by his glut, selfishness, ego and animalism. We can distinguish some traces of humanity, feeling and grace in this movie but they vanish, always masked by those mentioned in first place. Not only humanity is separeted from animality, as men are visibly opposed to women. In the beginning, he is rational, calm, cold and old, she is emotional, unstable and naive. While the movie is running, he keeps exactly as in the beginning, while she becomes more and more savage, deeply angry with men. Between the plot, awkward situations arise, all of them motivated by her actions, revealing great insecurity and bipolarity. I figure it's her trying to get her son back, punishing her for her loss by finding any other way to avoid herself from any sort of pleasure. In the Garden of Eden, Nature betrayed Man by enticing Eve to commit the Original Sin, that resulted on punishment, depriving all their sons of holiness. The same way happened with he and she. The movie is symbolically rich but it's way too negative. It leaves you thinking about Mankind's soul, not yours. 7/10",Antichrist

The ideas are perhaps interesting and certainly complex, but they don't seem explored and well-understood. The the execution is professional, but the themes and the characters feel rushed into existence.The heavy reliance on the watchable qualities of the actors' performances and extended slow-motion doesn't hide the feeling that the characters are missing important ingredients in this very complex statement. I think it could have been an unqualified work of genius had it been fleshed-out better - instead, it's a bit of a mess.Violence is an expensive gesture in art - you'd better get the math right if you want the audience on your side. When you add epic themes to violence (infant death, sexuality, psychological abuse, murder) and fail to make your audience aware of your point, you've... well, failed somewhere. You can't hide behind artistic license forever, particularly if you want to communicate. Some of the audience will always give you an 'A' for effort because you've attempted something difficult and made them feel.

And I think it was because the plot was so weird that it wasn't ingenious or thought-provoking in any way. I think they could have really made it more intriguing - then maybe the erotic aspect might have worked.

But that was not the case. After that, the movie went downhill. There was nothing gory, gross, or pyschologically scary. If not for my insomnia, I would've fallen asleep.The cast consisted of two people with minimal appearances by the little child that died in the opening scene. I'll give due respect and say that both of the cast members did a fine job in the movie and made it believable; however, I find it odd that the man didn't grieve the loss of his son at all. And since when was it okay for a doctor to treat a relative? I thought it was against ethics? The atmosphere was good for a drama movie, but as a horror movie, it failed. Not once was I scared in this movie. Even the blood ejaculation and vaginal mutilation wasn't too bad; can't say I've ever seen that kind of stuff in a movie though.The plot, well...I don't know if there was one. Perhaps I'm too stupid to understand what this movie represents artistically but I don't see anything antichrist about this. Was the woods where Eden was located supposed to be demonically possessed? Was Eden the woods or the cabin? Was being in Eden the reason they got possessed? Were they even possessed? None of it was clear and I guess that's the mystery of this movie...it's up to the viewer to interpret. So let's ask Ollie what he thinks of this movie: ""it sucked!""

I found the positive reviews of this film hilarious, with all the cerebral analysis of what appears to be another exercise in the writer-director's self-indulgences. So here's my interpretation of the messages I was supposed to take away from this film: Mommy is the Anti-Christ because she was mean to Baby Boy, purposely left the window open, purposely distracted Daddy with sex so that nobody noticed a window open during the dead of winter with a gale blowing through the apartment even though both were butt naked making out with their bedroom door ajar. In fact, Baby Boy saw Mommy and Daddy having sex, and evil Mommy looked at Baby Boy during sex, ignoring the toddler, and setting the stage for his untimely and tragic death, all to the background music of a beautiful opera. Then, Daddy doubles as husband and Mommy's grief counselor, patiently explaining and patronizing every tear and whimper coming from Mommy. Well...anyone would've crushed his testicles, drilled a hole in his calf muscle, and anchored a huge weight to his leg...after enduring this condescending answer man for days on end. And Mommy had to be possessed by some demon because then we get a close up of her clitoris being snipped off by a giant pair of shears...oh, and let's not forget the squirting blood from both the amputated clitoris and the penis that grew hard, despite the fact that the owner of the penis was likely in shock and unconscious from having his testicles smashed. Fire the consultants on this film, because then Daddy wakes up and drags his wounded and weighted leg down a trail in the woods, and manages to crawl inside a fox hole, only to encounter a buried black crow that begins to shriek, and of course, Daddy has opportunity to then wreak more violence on the animal over and over again. So there's another message: nature is evil. The blackbird is trying out ""out"" Daddy so it must be killed because it is evil like Mommy. Dear Lord, I could kick myself for watching this macabre descent into Lars Von Trier's mind. I'm thinking Lars must have walked in on his parents having sex, and maybe he wanted his Mommy to stop paying attention to his Daddy and pay attention to him. Maybe Little Lars felt neglected, like he could die and she wouldn't notice if his father was around...I don't know, only a psychiatrist can help here, but this film is so obviously one-sided in its depiction of a mother who seems fragile, sweet, and helpless really being a demon. And of a man who is clueless as to his wife's true nature until he receives results of an autopsy. What the film does not examine is why Daddy was so uninvolved in the parenting of Baby Boy? Why did Daddy not grieve? Why did Daddy's ass not freeze off while he was jack hammering Mommy in the beginning of the film, with a window open blowing snow drifts into the living room of the couples' apartment? Daddy is depicted as well intentioned, devoted to his wife, and with the sexuality of a stallion. Clearly Lars Von Trier has a bias. I gave it a vote of 2, 1 each for each of the actors. With all the nudity, sex scenes, and bad script they deserve all the credit.",Antichrist
172,mariammansuryan,Anti-Christ,9,15 August 2018,"The whole film I was trying to understand why its title is Antichrist.
So I was looking for allusions and that's what I'll talk about in this review.First of all, the garden of Eden, obviously, this is... the Garden of Eden... where Adam and Eve met each other and had their lovely adventures until that nasty snake came. It's also a representation of Heaven, and as ""she"" (since neither the man nor the woman have names here) says: Nature is Satan's church. A lot of things one location can be. A Satan's church is also represented visually many times, but one scene that especially sticks to me is that right before the Epilogue, where the forest becomes full of seemingly sexless naked bodies. Satan's church is obviously a very oxymoronic phrase, as Satan does not belong in the church, women even cover their heads to keep Satan away inside the church... but this weird custom means that he is after all in the church. One way or another, Satan seems to be hiding in the nature, like in the den of the fox... And it also hides within the human heart. In both ""her"" and more well controlled in ""his"". Maybe in Nick's heart too, and maybe it was Satan that pushed him to jump out.This brings me to a remark I can't not make. In both Antichrist and Melancholia, Lars Von Trier does something really great. He manages to reflect the world inside a person through the world outside. In Melancholia, the melancholy of the main character is symbolized by the planet approaching the Earth, and the clash is inevitable. At the end she makes peace with her melancholia, doesn't try to pretend anymore, and that's when the clash happens, while she rests in the magic cave.The same is here, the man goes into the forest, which is a representation of his wife's inner world, where he didn't have access for a long time, and only Nick did. Maybe that's why Nick jumped off, he was already crazy after seeing where her mother lived. At the end, where she stares at him jumping down, there is a feeling that she is somehow guilty for his death, and maybe she was... Maybe that's why his shoes were put on incorrectly, because she couldn't help but torture Nick.The film may be called Antichrist because the three wise men are Grief, Despair and Pain... So it's pretty antichrist. Another allusion is when she is lying in the grass, and her pose is exactly that of Christ's when he is resurrected.There is a lot to notice in this film. Mainly, I liked the combination of the moving camera reality and the slow motion abstractness, and the Pathetic Fallacy which Von Trier is a master of, I think.",Antichrist

It is intellectually challenging and sensitive, a tour-de-force that not everyone can complete. Lars Von Trier begins to unfold here the film would lead to an even higher level in Melancholia: an amazing photograph, stunning production design, and performances of an almost intolerable realism. Beyond this, Antichrist is an adult nightmare that makes films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre look like Dr. Dolittle. There is in homage to Tarkovsky film, but there is a huge difference: Tarkovsky always revealed deeply spiritual and pious. Von Triers shows us a demonic and ruthless nature. Of the countless clues and riddles proposed by Von Trier, perhaps very few viewers are able to reveal all, but the main idea of the film is that the feminine nature of evil has a very deep core, abysmal, connected with the mysteries of earth. Of course, there is no God and pray is in vain, because the only prophecy that we will hear is that of our own death, as horrible animals. Whatever it is about, we have to admire the genius of the director, taking from him humbly and reverently what we were able to understand, and tolerating what we do not understand. 9/10",Antichrist

The film shows us a chaotic, irrational and especially painful state of depression, the pain of a marriage that loses its child. The loss causes in the mother a perpetual state of remorse, this takes her aside with her husband, who is also her therapist, in a cabin in the forest where her instinct blooms (indirect cause of the initial tragedy) and self-flagellation because he can not control his instincts.

I felt sorry for Willem Dafoe, he picked the wrong movie just like Christian Bale signed up for T4.The lesson here for all the well claimed actors is to read the script yourself when you are interested in the movie. Don't let your agent or entourage do that for you! Ever learned conflict of interest as a kid?!I enjoyed Dafoe's performance better in his other works such as ""Shadow of the Vampire"", ""Clear & Present Danger"", ""Platoon"" ... etc. For the same genre movie that Danfoe shot, ""The last temptation of Christ"" is much better!In short, this one is crap",Antichrist

Thus begins Lars von Trier's latest romp destined to bring joy and enlightenment for the whole family. Yup, the gang's all here: Drilling a hole into your husband's leg? - Check. A blood-ejaculating penis? - Check. (Though you can bet your Dogma handbook it's a stand-in for Mr. Dafoe.) Female self-mutilation way down south? - Check. Laden with symbolism but - alas! - of little to no avail? - Check. And believe it or don't, the dialogue sequences are even worse.

I am still thinking about it this morning and thought about it most of the night. I am not sure what stuck in my mind the most though. Whether it was the graphic scenes or whether it was the message the film was putting across or both. If you're anything like me you may get lost a little in the middle of the film too as i struggled to understand what some of the things the characters were doing and going through had to do with the event the whole story is based on. But then it came together in the end. Wonderfully acted by the two characters that carry the whole film. But believe me when i say from the outset it is graphic in portraying sexual relations between the couple, some may say borderline pornography and the violent scenes are sure to make you wince, especially you men! Its a very disturbing film, dark and depressing throughout but the main theme of the film is coping with grief, or at least it starts out that way so if you only like things that are light heart and upbeat, this definitely is not for you. I know a lot on here think this film is simply the best and it doesn't get better, but because i feel it lost the theme somewhere in the middle and its only right at the very end in the final scenes it goes back to what the whole story was about initially i gave it a 6.",Antichrist
179,kevin-38242,Eewww,2,27 March 2016,"I've never found it so hard to watch a whole movie all the way through. I'm sure that's not an accident -- I have no doubt that von Trier planned every moment of violence, mutilation, and sado-masochistic sexuality very carefully. The acting is wholly convincing and the cinematography exquisite.I get all the symbolism and yadda yadda yadda, but if I want to have a crappy time I can spend a couple of hours shopping in Tesco. The message of the movie seems to be that life is crap, the world is crap, and there is no hope, no significance, and no redemption. Now where have we seen that before? I remember -- everywhere! I wonder if von Trier believes he's the first person on Earth to have this kind of existential crisis? That's the real tragedy of the movie -- it plumbs new depths of cinematic shock tactics to say something that, frankly, is not at all shocking. It's old.Without the sexual violence, Antrichrist would be wholly unremarkable -- just another self-absorbed pseudo-intellectual airing mental health problems that should be kept between himself and his therapist. The sexual elements don't make a boring movie interesting and engaging -- they just make it boring and repulsive.",Antichrist

Perhaps he wanted to make a psychological movie, and he used a lot of references; maybe he doesn't like movies like ""Omen"" and he tried to propose another way to deal the biblical argument of Hell, but the title is turned out to be only a ""porno-horror"", too similar to splatters than introspective movies. Too much scenes of blood and sex aren't necessary for the meaning of the plot, which is really simple: a bad remembrance gets a woman crazy and her husband tries to help who he loves. I consider aimless and comic the scenes with the fox, and absolutely expressionless those with all the acorns of the entire world that fall down in the roof to construct a climax of pressure. The only think I like of this title was the photograph; it was thoroughly a real disappointment: a not reacted provocation which can't get across to the audience.",Antichrist

182,Shakor77,"Horrible, terrible",1,30 September 2009,"I have seen a lot of movies in my days and although Quentin Tarrantinos Deathproof was probably the worst I think we got ourselves a new winner (loser) here.Where as Deathproof was mind-numbingly boring movie that made you wonder why you just wasted 120 minutes of your life this movie reminds me of an art gallery I once saw.Some ""artist"" had put a toilet seat on a stand and claimed that this is ""art"" where as in fact it was nothing but a toilet seat. This movie is that toilet seat. It probably claims by the ""artist"" who made it to be ""art"" but it is in fact just plain trash.Now where should I begin. Well why not with the title. This movie has very little to do with Antichrist, at least not what it is generally known for but maybe the ""artist"" has his own definition of that word as well. It has some loose connections to Christianity during medieval times and burning of witches but other than that the title has nothing else to do with the movie.The movie is basically about a man and women who's child jumps/trips out of the window while the couple are having sex. That is the opening scene and the only part of this movie worth watching (because of the music and choreography). The rest of the movie is about the couple dealing with the grief.Now some people seem to have interpreted the fact that the female in the movie acts much more irrational and emotional than the man who is calm and rational. However this women is in no way a normal women. She is a crazy psychopath who, before the child dies, severely abused him because she was under some kind of psychopathic delusion that ""he is leaving him"". She also watched while the kid climbed and tripped out of the window. Why? Who knows, because she was having an orgasm at the time and did not want to interrupt it? I can't say because this movie is one big mess created by a disillusioned who thinks he is creating a piece of art where in fact he created a piece of turd and calls it art.It is just a terrible, awful movie that is not frightening, inspiring, exciting or anything else that you could positively say about a movie.",Antichrist

185,akuma634,I didn't love or hate it but I really didn't get it,5,5 November 2010,"First off I gotta say it's been a few months since I've seen Antichrist and I don't remember every last detail of the movie so this isn't going to be the greatest review in the world. I've heard the movie thrown around here and there and some people called it the best horror movie of 2009, in that regard I disagree big time because nothing came close to Maskhead. I first tried to watch it on IFC but the picture quality wasn't that great and the sound was so low that I had to turn my TV volume to 100 to hear most of it over my air conditioner. After that I ended up renting the uncut Bluray, I'd only saw 20 something minutes on cable but the uncut really did have stuff you didn't see on premium cable channels.The plot is simple enough. It starts with a married couple having sex, very graphic sex to the point where it's pornographic. They even have a stunt penis penetrate the wife's body double in a close up. Was that really necessary? I mean even movies like A Serbian Film used a rubber phallus in place of the real thing, not a very tasteful movie but at least they had some limits. Don't get me wrong, I'm not afraid of sex or porn but there is a time and place for everything. While the sex scene is going on, they cut to the other room where their son escapes from his crib, climbs up to the window (which for reasons never explained was left wide open) and the kid tries to fly. During the orgasms they cut to the kid falling to his death.What this leads to is how the couple deals with their grief. The husband is a therapist so he tries to treat his wife like a patient more than his wife. The wife seems much more affected by it and blames herself for the death of their son. The home therapy sessions take up the majority of the movie and as it goes on the wife tries to have sex with her husband during the sessions and tries to use sex to punish herself. Eventually they go to a cabin in the woods to help with the grieving process and that's where the weird stuff really starts to happen. There is a lot of weird stuff that doesn't make any sense like the husband finds a dying animal and the animal starts talking. This isn't The Lion King but I guess that's part of the pretentious symbolism the movie gets praised for. There are other scenes with talking animals that are more WTF moments than anything else.The main thing is that the wife goes crazy and starts to torture her husband in really strange ways that don't make a lot of sense. In once scene she starts rubbing her husband's penis (again with the stunt penis) then she grabs a log of wood and smacks him right down on his penis. She starts to stroke him more until blood starts shooting out, kind of like a certain Cannibal Corpse song. He did pass out as soon as the log hit him but when he wakes up, his wife is still trying to torture him. She ends up getting the idea to cripple him by impaling his leg and sticking a weight into it, which is another scene where it doesn't make much sense in how you wouldn't get through the bones that easy and how would anyone think to try that? It leads to the husband trying to hide while the wife is hunting him down. In the end she goes from rage back to self loathing. She starts masturbating and then they close up to a body double's vagina and she takes a pair of scissors cuts a piece of herself out. Then you see the talking animals wander off and it's over.What the hell did I just see? It's as weird as movies like El Topo, Gozu, Visitor Q, and other movies that are either extremely heavy on symbolism or just made to be weird and confusing. It's a not an easy movie to review because like I said, I don't have a problem with porno but I don't need to see that or pornographic violence in an art house movie and as for the violence, I also have no problem with gore, some of my favorite movies are stuff like August Underground. It just felt out of place, especially with Willem Dafoe and a stunt penis. Two things I never thought I'd say in the same sentence. What was good was that they did film it in a really beautiful and artistic way. The sound and music was very well done. The gore effects were pretty solid, not Toe Tag Picture realistic but sufficient. It was actually shocking, especially in an age where most people think Saw and Hostel are gore movies, which is a sad statement. Also the movie is spent with just two characters which isn't easy to make that work without being really boring. I like how it was made and the acting is good but in terms of story telling and the lengths they go to for shock, it's hard to say it was good or bad. In a lot of ways it felt like a cheap shock movie trying way too hard to be artsy, especially the type of movie that gets people on the internet to obsesses over what it all means and accuse anyone who doesn't like it of being a moron. Personally I'd say there are better artsy movies and if you just want shock and gore then watch something like Murder Collection. I can't really recommend or condemn Antichrist.",Antichrist

Yes, it is provocative and a bit too smug about it. But how can a filmmaker not be smug about such artistry, such visceral beauty, such brutal and raw characterization, such brilliant and brave acting. Yes, it could have been less graphic. We could have gotten the picture without having had to have been witness to the events in such a clinical fashion. The ending is somewhat enigmatic and open to debate. The characters are both detestable, though I did feel empathy for 'He' towards the end in spite of his cold, calculating arrogance through most of the film. Altogether though, Lars Von Trier is a brave soul and brilliant in all his madness, angst, and arrogance.

188,kos-27,overcoming depression,7,18 October 2009,"As a fan of Lars Von Trier it was a big challenge to watch, interpret and rate this particular movie. There are two (or probably more) ways to look at the movie: 1 - On the basis of the storyline this movie is a psycho thriller horror movie about a woman slowly losing her mind. By reading stories about evil towards women in the past ages she becomes an evil woman herself possessed by a supernatural power from the woods, maybe a ghost of a witch reigned by nature (nature is Satan's church). The hunted becomes the hunter. The movie is constructed like a thriller: At first you are being lead in the wrong direction (she is the victim) and at the end there is the final showdown where all the cards are played. It is influenced and inspired by Asian horror movies. I can't agree with numerous interpretations that this movie is about the loss of a child and its parents deadly grief. One can not ignore the fact that the wife started to lose her mind long before her child died. The child's death is an event that destroys the balance between husband and wife and unfolds the storyline. The return to Eden (the place where all existence started) is the catalyst of their true natures.     2 - There is also an other aspect of the movie, much more difficult to discover and to interpret, because it's not a parallel story, it's more like a Bosch painting made of symbolic elements. The movie was a very personal experience for Lars Von Trier. He made it during his clinical depression and it helped him overcome it. Knowing that adds a psychoanalytical dimension to  the movie - it becomes almost a picture of Von Trier's state of mind. In a depression you pass through phases like grief, pain and despair. The symbols for it  are the deer who can't give birth (Grief), the fox who is eating his guts (Pain) and the raven who cannot die (Despair). They all are a picture of a diseased state of mind where chaos reigns. The woods are Trier's subconsciousness and He and She are the parts of his psyche: his Anima (She) and his Animus (He). His Anima stands for Eros and Tanatos, his unbound creativity, and his Animus stands for his ratio. Probably the cause of his illness was an overpowered Anima that suppressed his Animus. The bridge that is so important to cross is the connection between chaos and rationality: In order to be able to function again Von Trier has to destroy his Anima to be free from her dominance. The end shows a new beginning for him. He is cured and balanced. The women without faces are the possible new Animas of his future personality, harmless and peaceful. This movie is in no way misogynous because it's not about the actual nature of men and women but about archetypes, raw forces that reign everyone's mind, in fact the whole world. Chaos reigns - that's why there will always be wars, death and pain,rationally inexplicable.   Rating - Lars Von Trier tried to mix a simple horror story with personal experiences (depression, psychoanalysis) and general statements about the nature of things by using various symbols. This mixture, though breathtaking in every sense at times, doesn't function without friction. There is a sense of overloading anxiety counter posing calm, beauty and extreme brutality. Sometimes it's even irritating  because it tends to destroy the flow of the movie. It lacks the smooth and natural air. Everything seems to be rationalized and analyzed. But the most important flaw is that there is no clear and powerful message and that one has to fight"" for any interpretation. That's why so many people perceive it as shallow. I'm sorry to say that Antichrist (what's with the title?) doesn't reach the utter genius of some of his previous movies. But maybe this movie is only meant to cure his director and not to communicate a statement to the outside world.Let's interpret it as a personal healing interlude.",Antichrist

190,zuhairvazir,The Boy with One Red Shoe,9,26 May 2015,"Do not be mistaken. This is a film by the aberrant and outlandish Lars von Trier, who after a lengthy bout of depression made a film in 2009, which is an 'uneasy-intimate' experience with subtle, slow motion shots of snow fall, an explicit shower sex-scene and babies accidentally falling out of open windows. The camera follows the entire 23 second fall of the toddler until the tiny thing (I am still trying to convince myself that it was only a film prop; it certainly was, but not the fiendishly beautiful direction) makes contact with asphalt.The metamorphoses of the film into a full blown violent, psychological horror drama is film-making at its best and most vile. Not everything is in good taste (I look at scissors in a completely different way now), however the imagery and the smoky cinematography by an old friend of Triers, Manuel Alberto Claro make this beast one of the most intriguing, complex, mind-bending, faith-rattling & belief shattering films of all time.It's earthy, it's puerile, it's Dafoe, it's Gainsbourg, it is their contorted and extremely sullen and explosively funeral performances, the subconsciously hateful chemistry, their intimate connection, the penetration, the castration, the clitoridectomy 'home kit' deal gone bloody is all like Freud on a coke binge. And in the end it is a numbing masterpiece and more closely; an analogy of loss, grief, companionship, witchcraft, psychiatrist-husband-pants-ego issues and a mother trying to change the shape of her baby boy's feet by making him wear the left shoe on the right feet and right one on the left. A conflict where all hell breaks loose.Wrong sides. Completely wrong. God awful wrong. So wrong that it convinces the keen viewer of the animals that not only talk but speak of impending doom.A fantastic study of a relationship deliberately put to trial and the consequences of denial and a full blown, jaw-dropping revelation towards the end.",Antichrist

But don't get me pretty there were some parts I didn't like, hence the sex and violence. The sex gets to be a bit to graphic.

Despite the slow pacing, the movie is rife with shocking visuals and testy material. The film may also be his most exquisite one - the first half unravels like a demonic, impressionistic dream while the last half morphs into a mesmerizing nightmare, allowing the movie to pin itself as a slasher. Even if the director's previous efforts haven't grabbed your attention, this movie is sure to compel you in some way - that's precisely what it does.Still, von Trier's exposed representation of carnal desire and trauma is a lot to level with for the sake of art, especially for the actors involved. Multiple times throughout the movie we see Charlotte Gainsbourg revealing herself to an almost absurd extent. Luckily Gainsbourg rises past the visual debasement and puts on a completely chilling performance as the broken wife (this didn't save the movie from winning an anti-award from judges at the Cannes for its misogyny, though).""Antichrist"" is a hot-boiled meditation covered in controversy, and odds are we won't be seeing anything else like it anytime soon - I don't know whether that's a good thing or a bad thing.

194,drunkenhopfrog,Antichrist Flees from Being Profound,5,13 September 2009,"Lars Von Trier's ""Antichrist"" is supposed to shock one to the brink of profundity. If one decides to see this movie, that is what he should keep in mind. It is not a comfortable film to watch and, as the viewer, one is drawn further and further away from his movie watching comfort zone. As the film progresses it drives away from concept story telling to showing graphic occurrences for shock sake.In some ways like Paul Solet's ""Grace"" (2009), ""Antichrist"" is an ambitious attempt from a director who has outstanding visual flair, innovative ideas for cinematography, a sense of framing style and contrast, and unfortunately the need for overkill that seems to void the film of the statement of which its mechanics were intended to lead. Where the weakness of ""Grace"" comes from thematic overkill, ""Antichrist"" instead violates all rules of visual temperance that most film incorporates and instead builds visual horror upon horror upon horror. The redundant shock competition of the last third of the film robs for fist part of ""Antichrist"" of its textured subtly and enjoyable dark macabre theme and leads it to being perverse, one concludes, for the sake of perversion. The images themselves are not offensive to me. ""Antichrist"" shows a considerable amount of intercourse, fetish brutality, penis, vagina, and even penetration during intercourse. Be forewarned.Willem Dafore and Charlotte Gainsbourg star as an unnamed couple suffering from the tragic and bizarre loss of their only child. Dafoe is a psychiatrist who believes in a certain method approach to overcoming grief and fear. Gainsbourg is suffering the trauma more profoundly than her husband and eventually agrees to stop gratuitous medication in favor of intense therapy from Dafoe.That decision leads the couple to nature – or rather Eden – where they take up residence at a secluded cabin to battle the trauma and horror of their loss, the circumstance that caused their loss (the ultimate theme of the movie), and the nature of love, sex, and devotion. Ostensibly anyway.""Antichrist"" has brilliant touches. There is a reoccurring situation involving acorns falling on a tin roof that provides a jarring contrast, like nails on a chalkboard, to the soft and muted scenes it accompanies. It has the affect of driving one near Poe-mad with its intrusion. There are legitimate creepy and atmospheric visuals that, alone, could seep into ones subconscious. There is an interplay of dark and light, muted and saturated, seemingly non sequitur discoveries, and various colors that I believe tie into some meticulously planned meaning meant for discovery.In fact, there are many allegorical and extensional elements in the film. If I wanted to watch ""Antichrist"" again, I could deconstruct the various levels of innuendo leading to allegorical meanings and evolving subtext that I believe run like counter melodies throughout the film. Instead I only have the impression of half formed, though thoroughly forced, connections from the visual, spoken, and implied. Many things tie together and, like a Lynch film, it could have been interesting to try to put together the cues. Instead, unlike the subconsciously created elemental occurrence of David Lynch's craft, ""Antichrist"" presents a drearily composed and overtly manipulative narrative where the sole desire is to lead the viewer to the exact point that the director wishes him to arrive. That linear desire seemingly born of ego keeps the film from being in any part magical like the open and multilayer Lynch films and instead wallows in its constructed limitations. Instead of shattering hitherto accepted boundaries in film-making due to the natural need to expand those boundaries to tell the story, Lars von Trier tells a story that is constructed to obliterate those boundaries. Instead of elemental or even inspired Art in Film, ""Antichrist"" is an exercise in composed and altogether forced tawdry mayhem.Eventually one dismisses the film as a preachy, constructed, and boring affair.from www.PopBunker.net",Antichrist
195,kirkwuk,Questionable,7,26 July 2009,"This is not an easy film to watch, and isn't't for everyone, therefore typical of Von Trier's work (Dancer In The Dark, Dogville).This film is beautifully shot, and hit home for me as I suffer from anxiety. This movie started off as a reflection of my therapy. By the second half the movie has the tendency to lose viewers by the inane plot. It's your job to make your own interpretation of what the movie is about. A woman is grieving over the loss of her young son and blames herself. So her husband, also her therapist, takes her to Eden, a place they own in the woods. The fear is purely psychological and thus begins the leading lady going insane and becoming depersonalised in the cabin. I really didn't know what to think so I have been following web forums to see what other people made of it. Antichrist walks over the line on three occasions. Most of the cinema could not believe what they were seeing.",Antichrist

197,bt-wells99-1,A slightly disappointing departure from the master.,7,24 September 2009,"Lets get things straight. Lars von Trier is the greatest film maker of the last twenty years. I say film as opposed to movie, cos there are some great popular culture movie makers out there. But a far as film art goes, von Trier is the man. Our Bergman. We're at the stage now when everything he does is essential just by virtue of being done by him. Having said that, this film was a bit disappointing. The attempt to create some kind of von Trier horror film makes this a kind of departure, as his films are usually slightly theatrical melodramas, albeit incredibly artful and unsettling. So here we have an incredibly artful, unsettling horror (ish) film, that is visually arresting and powerfully acted. But perhaps the attempt to work within a different genre has created some problems for our favourite maverick loony revolutionary, because his sensibilities don't work as well here - at least I didn't think so. I found the He/She thing empty and pretentious. The roles of the woman and the man (with attendant psychoanalysis thrown in to guide us along) were rather simplistic and predictable. Eden? Men are abusive to women because they caused our downfall? I found everything rather pat and guided, compared to the magnificence of say Dogville or the Idiots, which are much more ambiguous and more rewarding for it. Von Trier creates the feeling of the presence of evil amazingly well, and the visuals are quite breathtaking - this is cinematography at its best. I was scared. But I feel that so much more could have been achieved here. Let me say that there is nothing gratuitous, pornographic or cheap about Antichrist. The director's use of the sick, disgusting things that are depicted is born of the most serious intentions on the part of a great artist trying to make a great work in his chosen medium. But this time, we have an interesting, diverting (mild) failure rather than the expected blockbusting masterpiece. I guess even the greats can't be great all the time.",Antichrist
198,teajel,"Dark,moody,disturbing but nothing more",4,19 June 2010,"there are only 3 word to describe this movie that is dark,moody,and disturbing although the film was artistic and has several artistic visual effect in this movie also the story that is unique and very dark that seriously be told toward audience to understand the film meaning about how deep and dark human nature that can turns into really evil and painful reality that can starts at anytime and anywhere with only such few event that effect the people who experience it for the rest of their life although this film did a great job to tell and told the message in unique and creative style for a psychological horror but overall it was too dark to be shown to audience whom watching it and not to mention it some scene are even hardly to watch because just really disturbing and could also be gross at some point also with many sex and violent that this movie has just really make this film hard to understand and even to be really respected. okay so maybe the director vision is perfectly told in his films but i just think that he's only thinking for himself and not the audience whom want to watch it not just for being serious but also entertaining but the film itself is even hardly entertaining plus with so much gruesome,violent,and a bit more sadistic in some point that make some people are uncomfortable to watch with but the acting in the other way are superb and very brave acting for both actor and end of words i am not dare to recommended this movie for anyone because there will be several people or critics who maybe think this movie are watchable and great horror especially for Lars Von Tier fans out there who loves his unique and creative film but i'm sure that a lot of people will drop this movie out in the middle of it because the very disturbing part in it that in the end this will eventually become an unwatchable film for many people",Antichrist
199,movieguysla,Dancing in the Dark,5,29 November 2009,"BREAKING THE WAVES and DANCER IN THE DARK were soul crushing, films that still live lonely in the recesses of my mind. Tragically submissive to love, Emily Watson relates her sexual exploits to her bedridden husband, Stellan Skarsgard, upon his request. A demanding, tyrannical love. A degrading and abusive love, but she forges through losing her sweet naiveté every time she spreads her legs. I have seen the BREAKING THE WAVES once, and I can't say if I will ever watch it again. It left me hollow and tortured.DANCER IN THE DARK, eliciting a most brilliant performance from the reclusive Bjork, was like being hit in the head with an anvil, forcing all rationale and logic out. Or, more appropriately, removing my heart, throwing it on the ground and stomping on it. Repeatedly. The fact that this film is essentially a musical only adds to the tragedy befallen upon Bjork. Either Von Trier is an evil misogynist, or he understands that women can ultimately endure much more than men both physically and emotionally.That being said, he stays somewhat true to this ideal in ANTICHRIST.Charlotte Gainsbourg's grieving mother is nothing if not fragile, tormented and weak, preyed upon by Willem Dafoe's condescending and pedantic psycho babble. After you suffer through the four chapters of ANTICHRIST, you see a glimmer of feminist hope when Gainsbourg's grief and fury are unleashed violently on Dafoe. But not so fast my female compatriots. Perhaps misogyny prevails after a bizarre act of violence spurs on more random violence with Dafoe as victor.The performances in ANTICHRIST are exceptional. There is some cinematic artistry and choice sounds that, pursued further, could have created a different type of film. Some of the imagery was dark and luscious, reminiscent of David Lynch, but without his blood beating through it, giving it a life of it's own. With Von Trier, it was gimmicky and trite, out of his element. I understand creating a ""horror"" film based around the stages of grief, but he leads us astray more often than not and his message gets muddled in with some idea of nature as ""Satan's church"", which makes no sense in the confines of the story (the story being one of irresponsible love making leading to the death of their child). Therefore, sex plays a huge part in the twisted script and becomes their final demise. Their internal punishment. Their shame. The difference between David Lynch's eccentric vision and Von Trier is that you take what you need from Lynch at your own discretion. Lynch does non-linear better than most. Von Trier has already proved he is a dark storyteller, one that we all glean a similar experience from. He does not need to be ""obscure"" or ""artistic"". He needs to go back to BREAKING THE WAVES and DANCER IN THE DARK and remember his craft. Remember what his gifts are and then go back to the drawing board.",Antichrist
200,arus_royus,Dedicated too.... no real spoilers but just to be safe.,7,16 May 2010,"I normally don't write reviews (cause I simply have no talent at it). But the credits of this movie annoyed me severely. ""Dedicated to Andrei Tarkovsky""...I got nothing against this movie. But it just isn't great enough by far to be worthy of being dedicated to a genius like Tarkovsky. I know really trivial in the larger scheme of things, but it really annoyed me. Over all though an OK movie. Except that I hope for their sake that they didn't hurt or disturb any animals for this film.Now about the movie. There is not much to say, except that the acting is well done, the motivations for the characters actions are a little shabby as indeed they were pretty (unbelievable and unrealistically) extreme. (but then again who REALLY understands madness?) The symbolism was kind of annoying and as another reviewer said ""he'd rather draw his on conclusions"" (he did not say the following) then having a fox (what ever that may mean) who eats his own entrails and talks about rage and chaos forced in my face (rabbies?). Overall missing this movie won't hurt, but then again watching it won't hurt either, in my opinion not too memorable. Except maybe the animal scenes might stick in your head but only because they are so wrong (I love animals don't like to see them hurt). The camera work is excellent though and the music (albeit little there is) is also quite nice. I also believe that the fuss about this movie is largely due to the animal scenes (in this case I have to agree with the fussies, of course compared to ""animal mass production"" these scenes are ""harmless""). Since there are a lot more violent and brutal slasher films out there where plenty of people get horribly maimed and murdered which cause little or no fuss with audiences and critics.",Antichrist
201,TiagoRicardo,A vision of evil,5,25 December 2013,"Lars Von Trier is a well-known unusual director, hated by some and adored by others. ""Antichrist"" is his first movie of his trilogy of depression and it was also the first movie from him that I had the opportunity to watch. When we are confronted with a movie strong as this one, it is easy to feel terrified, sad and at the same time marveled with the impressive cinematography and visual effects. A couple returns to their cabin in the forest after the loss of their son, while they try to repair their broken hearts and their marriage. This sad story culminates in a terrifying and distressing way that shocked the world. It is a cruel, visceral ending that it is not worthy to the story, not only because of the violent scenes of genital mutilation but also because of the evil environment that the story acquires near the end. Its a movie that divides the opinions but that does not leave anyone indifferently. ""Antichrist"" could be considered one of the most controversial/disturbing movies ever made. Its a movie that combines fear, anguish and despair. Lars Von Trier manages to shock and disturb the viewer in an unique way with this movie. A violent story filled with substance, ""Antichrist"" agitates our subconscious and makes us question about the true nature of evil.",Antichrist
202,sowvendra,Some things remained unexplained,10,7 June 2016,"The sex and the violence - that seem to have hogged all the attention in this otherwise beautifully crafted film - did not shock me much. No, honestly. There was just one scene, where The Woman snips off her own clitoris resulting in a fountain of blood, shook me a bit; otherwise I liked the rest of the film for its starkness - a typical Lars Von Trier thing - and, of course, its audacity.Yes, what did ultimately unnerve me were those parts that Von Trier chose to leave unexplained. Like, The Woman walking through the forest - as The Man tries to make her imagine in order to cure her - and those pale bodies mangled with one another, apparently under the ground. Then, the bodies and the hands emerging from the ground as The Man and The Woman have sex in the open, under that huge tree. Then, The Child's shoes--what connection did The Woman making The Child wear wrong shoes on both feet have with the plot of the film? Finally, who were those ""faceless"" women who The Man encounters after he leaves the cottage? These unanswered, unexplained things in Lars Von Trier's film, Antichrist, were far more eerie, far more disturbing than the sex and the violence or the dead fawn foetus hanging out of the vagina of a doe or a fox disemboweling itself and talking in a human voice at the same time or even the scene of The Child falling down to death as his parents have sex with one another and, apparently, do not see him climbing up a window.This film was made to shock, no doubt➖but then, Von Trier, like any other artist, has every right to express his vision; no matter if his works shock his audience. I appreciate Von Trier's vision, and his ability to pose questions - and also not care enough to answer those questions (or maybe there were hints that I missed) - and his ability to provoke curiosity. Also, I should mention the stark-at-times-surreal-at-times cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle. Also, one more thing I commend about Antichrist: It's length. I was so happy when the film shook me up a bit, disturbed me with those unexplained things, and got over in no time. I remember how my bums had turned numb while watching Von Trier's Breaking The Waves.",Antichrist
203,foxface,A Woman's Sorrow,7,1 November 2009,"Antichrist can be considered a horrible film, but I suggest you don't give up on it so easily. I think this film isn't misogynistic, but in a weird way, is trying to be the opposite. Number one, typically the antichrist is thought of as a male, not a female. As far as nature and the natural order of things, women are the givers of life, yet childbirth is a painful process. Charlotte Gainsbourg's character is at odds with her true nature, because she feels marginalized through motherhood and marriage. Deep down she has a strong need for power and to be in control. Gainsbourg's character only controls Dafoe's character through sex or pain or a combination of both. If we get religious at this point, Willem Dafoe's character is the ""Adam"" to Gainsbourg's ""Eve"" and just as in the bible, fails to protect Gainsbourg from evil. The fact that they return to Eden where Satan lurks, to find the answers to their grief and to heal is ironic.This film has a female who goes against her nature, or what the idea of woman/motherhood is, acts as the most disturbing part of this film. More so than the violence and mutilation scenes. We know she is murderous in the fact she saw Nick at the window, but did not stop having sex, because she would have interrupted her pleasure. Women putting their pleasure (especially sexual) above their children is a no-no. This also leads to the question of what did happen the previous summer with Nick's feet. There is one scene that may offer an explanation besides the shoes being on the wrong feet. During a dream recollection the female states she heard a child crying but checked on Nick and found out he was okay, but he was in a shed. However, because we don't have the information we have at the end of the film, it is possible she did something to Nick's feet, similar to her husband's on a small scale and blocked it out of her mind, or tried to cover it up with the shoes on the wrong feet.Willem Dafoe's character is so all knowing, so smug, that it is easy to see why the female feels detached from him, though he sees it as if she is part of him (again Adam reference). But again, Adam wasn't aware of the fact that when left alone, Eve was capable of sin. Dafoe's character plays God, but even Eden is full of bad things in nature: ticks, still born babies, self mutilation, chaos in the physical aspect of the woods. Eden is physically hard to reach and ultimately doesn't exist in the literal since. However, you do feel for him, once he puts the pieces of the puzzle together, but his wife's evil is more volatile and deeper than he realizes. So what does he do, he expels his wife, who at this point, has become Satan, but because she is a woman a witch metaphor develops here. He builds a pyre and without reservation burns her after he chokes her to death. OK I can see where misogyny comes into play for some audience members. Yet, at this point of the film, I felt I was watching two characters in the book Gynocide and felt the wife had gained power because she wanted her life to be over. Dafore's character followed his wife's unknown wishes in a strange way.The ending of this film, with the women coming up to Dafoe's character and the woods losing its contorted features gave me two trains of thought: One is Dafoe's character freed himself from evil. The second is that he didn't free himself from evil and that the women were coming for him. The three beggars reminded more of sin, death, and resurrection. Dafoe had to acknowledge the sin, (death of his child) atone the sin by killing his wife, and resurrect himself by leaving Eden.The cinematography at the beginning and end of this film is beautiful. You can take that away from Lars van Trier. His message may have been garbled, or it may have been a fable, which are often full of bad people and evil things. There is no tidy ending and American audiences in particular have to try to learn to accommodate this. A cult classic in the making.",Antichrist
204,RobertWhitebrow,Arti-christ and the three pretentious beggars.,4,17 December 2020,"This movie attempts to you in a box built of emotions and shake it, sending you bouncing off the walls until you get nauseated. does it elicit strong emotions - sure, but then again Von Trier is pretty well known for having on par cinematography to do that. That being said is is nowhere near as intelligent as people make it out to be. Just because strong imagery (such as child death, animal cruelty and genital mutilation) got a reaction out of you that does not mean it was an intelligent reaction. In fact it is pretty primal. So much so I consider it very lowbrow.In a truly intelligent piece of cinema the audience should be expected to sift through a bit of muck on their own and THEN find the diamond in the much. Instead this movie puts you in a field of muck and then pours several metric tons of ""diamonds"" on you in the form of symbolism so blatant that eventually realize the diamonds are made of cheap glass and are not worth either looking for or keeping after the movie is over.As far as the plot goes there's nothing in it that has not been done far better in movies from previous years so instead of going through it I will mention a few scenes that are particularly obtuse and over the top. So the movie starts with a hardcore sex scene presented in a very graphic way. In the meantime their little kid exits its crib and jump out of the window as the couple climaxes. It's all in black and white with very serene operatic music as background. Highbrow art it is not.Later on the couple grieves and moves in the woods while in the meantime having sex at every turn. So the same act that they should associate with their child's death is something they do on the regular. Could it be they are bad parents? Well at one time they have sex underneath a withered tree. Could this symbolize how they cannot nurture ""fruit"" and are bad parents? Then the man sees a deer walking around with a half-born, dead and hanging from its rear. Could this symbolize how they are bad parents? Maybe you're seeing a pattern here...these are by far not the only examples of heavy obvious beat-you-over-the-head symbolism. They see a fox tearing chunks off itself, symbolizing how they are being self-destructive. The woman put the shoes backwards on her kid in multiple pictures, symbolizing how she subconsciously hated the kid. She batters the man's genitals then proceeds to have sex with him resulting in a bloody ejaculation. You guessed it - the symbolism here is that she hates the fruit of his loins but wants the pleasure part of it, but hates herself for it. This is once again beaten into the audience as she proceeds to mutilate her own genitals in extreme graphic detail. Etc. etc.This pattern is just about the entire movie. Extremely graphic, presented in a stylized manner, with pretentious cinematography and ""taboo"" actions but it's about as subtle as bat strike across the face.Instead of teaching you how to cook refined cuisine and giving you the ingredients, this movie spoon-feeds you forcefully all of its supposed brilliance which it seems profoundly cognizant of and in love with. It certainly isn't a complete mess and might be worth the watch but don't expect to be blown away. Just heavily nauseated with a raised eyebrow throughout.",Antichrist
205,Fritz_Gerlich,Potent Examination of Motherhood,10,7 March 2011,"Here is a film that will confound some and resonate with others. Which side of the divide you fall on will depend on your childhood. The director is a fearless filmmaker, but in real life he is hobbled by depression and phobias so bad he almost had to give up filmaking. I suspect, but have no way of knowing for sure, that his childhood was disastrous and his mother evil/crazy. As such, I see this film as a statement feminine evil, and in particular the feminine evil of pernicious mothering. Mothering in its pure and good form, involves unconditional love and supportive nurturing and in a perfect world, all mothers would be that way. The reality of course is that not all children are so lucky. Some are betrayed by the very person that holds their life in her hand. Some mothers are evil to varying degrees. My reading of the film is that She (the female lead is never named) is an evil mother symbol and He is the child symbol. The torture inflicted on He is pretty clear. A millstone is bolted onto his leg, and his manhood is crushed. This can be read as the legacy of evil mothering on some adult male survivors in the most blunt of terms. The director does not deal with female children because this is his story and he is a man; nobody should read into the story misogyny. I could continue, but I mostly just wanted to bring up these ideas so people could have a better footing on which to understand the movie as a personal statement of the director. Of course, as with all true art, ymmv.",Antichrist
206,marino_touchdowns,I didn't want to like it.,9,2 November 2011,"There are some movies out there that were made strictly for the purpose of shaking the audience. I have seen some disgusting films in my time, and Antichrist does not compare with the gruesomeness of Salo (1975) or Tetsuo (1989). But there is something about van Trier's visual style that makes this an incredibly difficult movie to watch.Calling it van Trier's ""style"" may be giving the writer/director a bit too much credit. Rather than using skillful camera-work or excellent framing - he uses graphic imagery. In the first five minutes of the film the audience sees a toddler fall to his death, Willem Dafoe's penis and scrotum, vaginal penetration and tons of guy-butt. Later in the film the audience is given the striking visual of Dafoe ejaculating blood and Charlotte Gainsbourg using scissors to cut off a piece of her vagina. And von Trier shows everything.Antichrist is a little gross, yes, but it also has a somewhat compelling story to tell. After losing their son in an accident, a married couple retreats to the woods to try and fix their declining mental conditions. Dafoe plays a character who is simply known as ""He"". He is a psychologist who believes that he can cure his wife of her traumatic dementia. I feel okay telling my readers that he does not successfully cure his wife. Things spiral out of control and the film never looks back.The strongest part of the film is the performances by Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg. I have seen directors do worse things to their actors, but never with so much conviction and demand. They have noticeably sold out to the belief that von Trier would not set them off in the wrong direction. Their brilliance as an on-screen duo is what makes watching the disgusting sequences worth the nightmares.Dafoe is great in this movie, but Antichrist is nothing without the bravery of Charlotte Gainsbourg. Her character is sinister, pathetic, sad, frightening and sick. There is some level of personal pain in every move that she makes. But how could there not be? It is hard to not get personal when you are asked to masturbate on screen for a couple of minutes.The narrative of the film is chopped up into chapters - grief, pain and despair. Each feeling is accompanied by an animal to form some sort of mystical constellation. Grief is represented by a disfigured deer, pain by a talking fox and despair by a persistent raven. Together they are called the three beggars, and something bad will happen when they get together. I understand that this does not make a ton of sense, but somehow von Trier makes it work. Antichrist was not a difficult film to follow.Here we have a movie that wants to explore the depths of insanity, pain, sexual gratification and evil. Is there truly some kind of evil out there that we do not know about? Antichrist says yes. Some have accused the film of being closer to the side of ""torture porn"", but I honestly believe that every moment was necessary to tell such a dark and emotionally complex story. It was not the easiest film to watch, but I promise I will never forget it.",Antichrist

This director has the most extensive knowledge of the European classical art, painting in special, but also music, sculpture and architecture. Such complex and intricate are the cultural quotes of every shot that you have to ignore the plot altogether.I wasn't interested in the plot, what the couple did there was of secondary importance. The MAIN thing was the stunning composition of the shots,it was like the biggest treat in a museum of art. The SURPRISE factor was essential, what is going to appear under each leaf, under the dust or in a corner of the room. Von Trier proved himself a great storyteller in Breaking the waves, Dancer in the dark, etc. He didn't have to prove anything in regard of storytelling here.

208,GloriousGooner,Unforgettable,9,31 March 2010,"Within a complex tapestry of theology and symbolism Lars Von Trier's Antichrist plums the depths of the human condition taking cinema to places it has never gone nor ever wanted to go before. Following the establishing tragic accident (their son falls out of a window while they make love) He and She journey out to Eden, a remote lodge in the woods, for therapy where their lives and souls are changed forever. Far from a traditional horror film LVT gives us the darkest of psychological works that starts with shock before travelling down the spiral through grief, despair and panic ending in travesty. Gainsbourg and Defoe take us there, they carry the film on their monumental performances - Gainsbourg gives everything physically and emotionally to her role, while Defoe's character's grip on intellectualism is unrelenting. With death and depression permeating every frame of the film it has to be said that much of what is seen is stunningly beautiful - i really cant overstate the quality of the cinematography; at the same time the hauntingly evocative sound design adds that much needed 3rd dimension of pure evil that finishes off the work perfectly. It says and shows many disgusting things about humanity, but does so with such purity of vision, such artistic conviction that i found it totally irresistible. Not a film i'd want to see again in a hurry but certainly one i'm thankful i've experienced - it pushes the envelope in hitherto unforeseen ways that will probably affect film as a medium for years to come. If nothing else, i hope it helped LVT's recovery.",Antichrist
209,jeff-coatney,As Pagan An Orgy Of The Psyche As You're Likely To Get,1,2 November 2009,"Yes, I rated this film One Star. It is not entertaining, necessarily enlightening, or revealing really. But don't let my One Star review lead you astray. I could not, in good conscience give it a six or seven. Its not horror, but it is horrifying. It is beautifully cinematic, but not in a way that captivates, yet it doesn't let you look away. I believe this experience is Pagan. Not that it strips away one's belief system in order to pervade your senses with the rawest expression of nature. The sexuality is stark, toxic, inherently dangerous and brutal. Its animalistic and raw. Equal parts satisfying and bloodlettingly cruel. You feel as if you are being pulled inside the film, through the use of imagery and the unwinding of time, and lashed to a terrible conveyor belt that takes you to a dark place of cold fire and evisceration. It is the animal's view of the forest. we are as much the prey, we humans, as the predator. And what of the innate evil that is woman, as the film supposes? The woman is a beastly servant of an unseen master, driven by uncivilized carnal desire to procreate, nurture briefly and give her offspring only the illusion of filial connectivity. She, marching to a drumbeat of biology, devoid of emotion and casually cruel, disconnected from the false construct of what we hold to be civilization, wreaks havoc and leaves a wake of destruction to which the Man is drawn like a moth to a flame. Her power as the epicenter, the gateway through which life and death passes, results in a furious clockwork of Pagan expression, which is at once familiar and malignantly inevitable. Or so Lars Von Trier seems to believe. If you are confused by this review, imagine how it felt to watch the film.",Antichrist
210,dancemacabre,"A Disturbing, Bizarre and Provocking",8,20 September 2009,"I saw this movie right now and I'm in big dilemma about voting. I don't know is it good or bad or excellent because some thing I just don't get it about this movie. I'm not fan of Von Trier movies or art movie either, but this is categorized as a horror and I decided to watch it, because I have already been convinced that horrors from Europe are just way realistic and interesting than American ones. For example like High Tension, Martyrs, Inside, Frontiers etc.Antichrist isn't in overall a horror movie, it's more like art drama with some bizarre and bloody scenes. Plot is already known and I don't have to mention it. I had conclusion that is plot talking about sexuality in some negative way, because in the moment when two main roles had sex, their child fall from the window. If mother didn't have sex with husband in the opening scene, she would take care of her son and observe him. This movie talking about woman guilt and she starting to be obsessed with sexuality and she falling into deep stain of depression which causing panic, hearing voices and talking about some strange religious and occult stuff. In the end she get insane and frustrating about her sexual needs in that way she taking scissors and cuts off her vagina. For me, it is top of the shocking scenes and really disgusting and gore. I think is very explicit displayed to our observer and I shall not recommend this movie for people who are too sensitive.About movie all what can I say it is bizarre and not for everyone, especially who isn't habitual to this type of movies. It makes you think for a while and has a some message carved into it. Also, the acting of Willem Dafoe is really good and his role is very appropriate and perfectly fit into this movie and atmosphere, and not forget to mention Charlotte Gainsbourg who received award on the Cannes festival.When all gets calculated i have to say that I'm pretty satisfied with this movie in some aspects. And I must say that soundtrack is rare and only appears at the beginning and the end. The end scene was very symbolic and memorable.",Antichrist

212,barbara-czarniawska,The perfect misogynist,9,15 June 2009,"This movie conveys a misogynist message of such a strength that it hardly has any competitors throughout the history, but, what can I say As Carlsberg is probably the best bear in the world, so Lars von Trier is probably the best director in the world. (Not that he is shy about it). Thus a true dilemma for a feminist: abhor the message or admire the art? I chose to do both. Additionally, I systematically avoid horror movies, and yet I chose to seethis one (closing my eyes only now and then). One needs to make excursions outside safe enclaves of one's taste. The movie raises many questions concerning the technical details: how were certain scenes done, which are computer effects and which actual scenes – but knowing von Trier and Zentropa we will never learn that. They tend to keep their secrets.All in all, I still prefer The Kingdom – for its crazy humor – and wish von Trier did the missing parts, but ""Antichrist"" is definitely something to see.",Antichrist

If you hate it, you're just as complimentary as someone who loves it. You have allowed it to occupy your passion. Indifference would be worst. When I saw it in the cinema, there was a sort of heckler who proclaimed that 'we all wasted our money and we know it' - as if the self-importance of his opinion was relevant to anyone else. Other people in the audience told him to shut up - and yet he stayed until the end of the movie that he apparently hated - LOL.",Antichrist

217,sandtonvideo,Brutal Yet Brilliant,7,12 February 2011,"Emotionally brutal, sexually graphic, surreal, and challenging, Lars von Trier's film ANTICHRIST is a look at how a tragedy rips apart the fabric of the marriage of a couple. The name of the movie comes from the fact that the death of a character at the beginning of the movie submerges the couple into guilt and ""sin"", opposite to the Christian idea of Christ's power to redeem people from sin. As such, the movie has no particular anti-Christian sentiment, nor is it a horror movie; rather, it is a dream-like psychological drama. More deeply, the movie reveals that it is also about misogyny, and the pervasive nature of its influence, even among men and even women who would never regard themselves as being subject to misogynist tendencies. Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg make themselves extremely vulnerable as actors in portraying these characters, and the film asks much of them, and also of the viewer watching the film. With an emotional impact that will probably stick with viewers for some time after watching the film, this is recommended for those with a love of psychological art movies, and the ability to handle strong disturbing images.",Antichrist

I liked the tone of this film, the cinematography, the sets, etc. I think my biggest problem may have been the actors or the acting. I guess I didn't think Dafoe is good; a bit too ""B""-class. He's got a weird kind of off-beat looking face, so he ends up in B-movies and offbeat films a lot; I just don't think I enjoy the way he acts. He is kind of...black. Which is fitting for this film: there isn't a lot of dynamic character development in this movie, which can be difficult to adjust to. The philosophical themes and concepts are the centerpiece here, not the individual characters and their human nuances, other than those that bolster the main ideas. That's all well and good; I enjoy this kind of approach sometimes, and I like some of Lars von Trier's work (especially Riget, though it was a bit more light-hearted). I just didn't really have an opinion on either one of them. All of the gore and sexuality, the exploration of the concept of misogyny (depicting misogyny does not make one misogynist)....if you are seriously offended by that than you are a.)very innocent, and that's nice, I'm happy for you, now turn off the TV before you grow up jaded, or b.)you are close minded or conservative and just plain unwilling to challenge yourself, which is also okay. We just won't make good friends, probably. But, anyways, I just didn't like the acting--which COULD be a directional problem or an actor problem. Or, just my problem.",Antichrist

One minute the two are recovering from their kid's death, next they are talking like adolescent goths and battering birds. Having said that, the performances of the two leads are tremendous, the initial scenes are brilliant and drew me in to the couples horror, and the film escalates wonderfully. A lot is said of the violence, but it is unusual and so cruel it works, and the thing with the shoes is much more disturbing than the physical acts. I loved it.

222,sledgehammer86,"Difficult, but extremely rewarding",9,20 January 2013,"Highly disturbing and intense. Antichrist is remembered for an absolutely shocking scene. It is indeed nearly unbearable, but it is a crucial scene in a movie I'd like to be remembered for much more. Willem Dafoe plays a difficult controlled and detached role. Charlotte Gainsbourg's unstable role is downright believable. Antichrist is an amazing work, very largely built on associative images and feelings. In some ways it is a dark distant cousin of Don't Look Now, another movie with a couple grieving over the death of their child. Like that movie, this movie is as much about a couple in a world in which all of its beauty is somehow transformed into an evil and ugly thing. The character work here is stellar, but a lot of the darkness comes from the places the characters move through. Note how there are various things (out of nature) falling throughout the movie, constantly evoking the fall of the dead child. To cap it off Antichrist boosts the most beautiful cinematography of Von Trier's career yet, glossy and macabre at the same time.Antichrist is a difficult movie. It is not a movie that is to be liked. It is about fear. Fear is an emotion that should scare the hell out of you, not something to laugh at. If this movie succeeded in shocking the crap out of audiences, I say Von Trier got across his point about fear just fine.",Antichrist

224,Reel_World,Art-house film?,1,15 December 2010,"After all the hype I heard surrounding Antichrist, I finally decided to sit down and watch it. Wow. This has to be the most disturbing film I've seen since Human Centipede. Granted, the cinematography was very good, but the overall movie is just atrocious! Starting off with a slo-mo sex scene which leaves little to the imagination, the film goes downhill from there. After their kid falls out of a window to his death, the couple head off to their cabin in the woods to grieve. What follows is copious amounts of dialogue mixed with some of the most cringe inducing scenes that anyone has ever witnessed. There is no redeeming value to this film, and I am shocked at the awards it garnered. Some scenes were almost enough to make me want to turn the DVD off. Despite being broken up into ""Chapters"" - the film has no real flow. It felt like it was 20 minutes at a time of the two leads talking, followed by what in my opinion is torture porn that would be enough for most people to walk out of the film. Some of the more nasty highlights would include: Sex scenes which include shots of full on penetration. A scene where Gainsbourg is lying naked in the forest masturbating, until Dafoe arrives on scene and starts to have sex with her while arms emerge from the tree stump they lie on. An especially nasty scene where she smashes his testicles with a log and then masturbates him until he ejaculates blood. The follow on to that bit where she drills a hole in his leg, sticks her finger in the wound and then bolts a weight to his leg.And who can forget the infamous scene near the end where she slides a pair of scissors into her vagina and removes her clitoris. If this is considered art, then cinema is on a downhill slide. This film is not for the squeamish, and I cannot recommend the title to anyone. Avoid at all costs.",Antichrist

The first hour and a quarter were slow and dull and nothing really notable happened at all. It was quite emotionally unsettling and uncomfortable at times but I didn't find myself gripped to watch further and found that it was quite hard to tolerate 2 hours of it. I didn't feel connected or drawn into the characters at all as they were quite flat and their behaviours very hard to understand. However, as always with Lars Von Triers films, there was stunning visuals and shots and heavy subject matters tackled. The gore and violence was done well and with intention, but the overall message of the film was confusing and hard to understand what actually happened. If you love Lars Von Triers previous films then go for it, but otherwise you won't miss much and you'll save two hours of your life.",Antichrist
231,meininky,Flawed but beautiful,5,19 January 2010,"Before I start, my rating of 50% isn't a denouncement of this movie's quality. In truth, I'm completely torn about this movie. It was gorgeous in many ways, and the meaning bubbling beneath the surface is intriguing, but at the same time, it's absolutely horrific and disturbing. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, simply because it's impossible to enjoy this movie. Respect it, certainly. Admire it, perhaps. But I can't imagine anyone wanting to see this movie more than once.My main problem with this film is the lack of context it provides. The plot is paper-thin, so laying on awkward animal/astrological symbolism feels almost pretentious (it's a tough call). The movie, instead of focusing on a coherent story, delves deeper into the psychological, specifically the way male and female minds understand and relate to each other. The movie seems anti-feminist, perhaps because of the way it discusses the natural evilness of mankind, and, more specifically, womankind. This is surely demonstrated in Charlotte Gainsbourg's character, and when considered on a wider scale, all evil people come from a woman, right?Without much of a plot, and with little foundation for the characters before Her descent into grieving madness begins, it's hard to care much about the characters. That's not to say the performances aren't impressive, because they are. Both Gainsbourg and Willem Dafoe handle both the grisly and the ridiculous (""CHAOS REIGNS!"") very ably. Were it not for the film's incredibly controversial, hard-to-digest nature, Oscar nominations wouldn't be completely out of the question. As it is, the performances stand as one of the aspects that even turned- off audiences can admire (and audiences will definitely be turned off by this movie: three of the six people in my theater left before the film's end).The other inarguable positive element of Antichrist is the beautiful, almost poetic cinematography. There's a great mixture of long, high-angle shots and more frenzied, hand-held close-ups as the violence intensifies. The extensive use of slow-motion (and the general slow pace of the movie) adds to the dreamy aspect of the film, and the jarring editing leads to a heightened sense of disconnect from what's happening on screen. It reflects both Her fractured psychology and the disjointed narrative itself.The narrative is broken into three chapters with a prologue and epilogue. The prologue is unspeakably beautiful, a black-and-white juxtaposition of love (more accurately, lust) and death, accompanied by a gorgeous operatic number. The same artistic simplicity is applied to the more enigmatic epilogue. But the three chapters which make up the bulk of the movie are tacked onto states of coping with loss, and, by extension, animals represented in a fateful constellation. It's ridiculous and exciting by turns, but ultimately, the symbolism is muted by the incredible graphic-ness of what happens.If you're at all familiar with this film, you know that there is genital mutilation in this film, and that it is shown, completely. Even knowing this going in, I was shocked and disturbed by the extent of what was shown, although honestly, it was probably the tamest it could've been, which in itself is disturbing. I felt like puking, or fainting, or leaving (as another man did right before the fateful scene, shouting ""Oh, come on!""; the other two were long gone by that point), but, like the clichéd car wreck, I couldn't look away.This is where the question of art comes into play. Can I really judge a movie that clearly is using the violence not for the simple shock factor, but for a higher (yet murky) artistic purpose, for going to such grotesque lengths? An artist should have free reign to employ whatever techniques he or she wants to maintain the integrity of his or her original vision, yes? This isn't Saw or Hostel, where the gore is the reason the movie exists. Here, the violence underlies the danger of loneliness, of fear, of nature itself.Where does this leave me? Confused. Not only about the movie, but about if I'm glad I saw the movie. It was a singular film-going experience: no question there. But was I enlightened in any way? Even if I wasn't (and I suspect I'll have to peruse more message boards before I can come to a solid conclusion on that point), I was, at the very least, challenged, which is more than I can say about most trips to the theater.5/10",Antichrist
232,TodayIsTheDayOurSinsWillBeOver,Excellence.,9,14 August 2010,"I heard about Lars Von Trier's Anti Christ a few months before it was released in the UK. The website that I heard about the movie on, was putting it out to be some exploitation jibber jabber that only had the intent to shock the viewer. A few months later, I decided to buy it to see it for myself since it was getting a bad rep for being nothing more than just an ""excuse"" to show ""graphic violence"" and ""sexual violence"". I bought it, watched it, and this is where I tell you my views and comments on this movie.Anti Christ is by no means exploitation to me. It doesn't even feel like an exploitation film, no where near it. I've seen exploitation trashy movies, and although Anti Christ is graphic from start to finish, it's a serious work exploring grief, mental illness, and loss of a loved one. Anti Christ deals with a couple who loss their child due to an unfortunate accident one night while they're making love. After this, their lives get changed forever, and may I add for the worse. The movie shows in unflinching details the psychological and physical effects of depression, and having a mental breakdown because of grief and the loss of a child. The cinematography (especially the opening scene with the music) of the movie is just so incredibly well done, but in saying that, as you might have guessed with the subject matter of the film, the tone of it, is incredibly dark, and compelling. It's sad, but yet keeps you on your seat until the very end. Anti Christ will not be a movie for everyone, but for those who can appreciate it for what it is, you will find something worth while here. It contains many unpleasant scenes, violent, psychologically upsetting, self harm and sexually disturbing scenes that many people will find shocking and disgusting. But, what did you expect a film about grief, loss, fear, and depression to be like? Fun? Anti-Christ is realistic. The two actors that played their respective roles for this movie, deserve all the Oscars they get and rewards. They done a superb job, one which must have been physically demanding for them both to do.Anti Christ isn't like any other movie I've watched before. If you think it's a movie you would be interested in seeing, certainly don't let the graphic scenes in it put you off, but also don't go into watching it expecting a joy-ride. Understand and appreciate the movie for what it is. There's no doubt in my mind, if the movie was to be rated in America instead of ""Unrated"" it would get an ""X"", or more known as ""NC17"", higher than a ""R"" rating.I found the movie very dark, and disturbing, but one that I couldn't put down in anyway, because with the way it deals with the subject at hand. It's not a movie I enjoyed watching in any sense of the word ""enjoyed"", but I found it very a very unique piece of film making. Some of the scenes in it, made me feel very uneasy. But then again who would enjoy watching a movie which deals with such themes. For the overall cinematography, and acting/directing/music, I definitely give this movie a full 5 out of 5.Anti Christ will not be for everyone, but if you can take the time to appreciate the movie, you will find something to watch.",Antichrist

Years of graphic violence in the media were enough to desensitize me quite a bit, but this is a masterful creation of a psychological setting that causes your insides to churn frequently, like i haven't felt since the first depictions of violence that came across my life...So the ability to reach into your physiology with images and sounds (molten into the picture of a soundtrack, there is no movie+soundtrack, it's one whole experience) is enough to stick around through this couple of hours of nausea...So disturbing, that i think 25+ should be recommended as the viewing age... Or no age at all, i still cannot tell if it would have been better not to have sit through this...About the cinematic aspects, it's all brilliant from beginning to end, camera angles and lighting are perfect all around, and in most scenes you get the feeling you are looking at a good neo-Gothic / abstract painting, with the added nauseating aspect that you also get a vivid first person feeling, from the camera movements (sometimes a sharp sideways snap, then instantly zooming into focus, like looking down to pick-up a toy) to the sound track (like the humming and whistling you hear just before fainting, or after intense pain, or even the ""inside your head"" sound surrounding sexual content). At times this feels like a new media, electro-digital-acoustic image and sound experience, where the director brilliantly places the set ""inside your head"", inside your own hearing and viewing organs, and not through a third person perspective from a lifeless camera... Too bad that his message has been so grim, the ability to communicate is impressive in this person (Lars Von Trier).The acting is plastered inside this media-trap, as models posing to a painter would be, so there is very little to comment on it when you can easily tell that both ""he"" and ""she"" were submitted by a torrent of overwhelmingly powerful portraits, where what they did was always ten times more important than how they did it. And the graphic representation of everything is so explicit and powerful that i could understand if barf bags were distributed at the entrance of the movie theater...So if you finally manage to stick around, you may experience a weird satisfaction that there is still something impressionable inside yourself (such as the inner child that has just jumped out the window), and a deep anger that someone put you through this with such skill. I wish i could write curse words here, but since i cannot, Fank You Lars Von Trier, for ruining my Sunday.",Antichrist

There are a few scenes in this film that will strike any normal brain as positively repugnant.Is this an anti-intellectual, anti-experimental critique? Call it what you like, but good acting + Texas Chainsaw Massacre + Kathy Bates' Misery does not automatically constitute profound art. This is a gore flic and I'm perplexed by the number of positive reviews on here.I'm disappointed in human kind right now, after having perused the number of positive reviews for this movie.Yes, we get it.

A typical formula in terms of character development.The message would have been just as clear, minus the nausea, without the genitalia mutilation.I sat through the end only because I knew nothing could be worse in the final quarter of the movie than what I had been subject to in the third.POSITIVES?

Much has been made of the the violence in this film but folks that watch a lot of horror and extreme Asian cinema have basically seen stuff like this before. I didn't have an emotional response to it. As an allegory, it's silly. As a meditation on grief, it's too diffuse. I may see Antichrist again to see if I feel differently, but it's kind of a slog. I have watched Dogville at least 10 times and I'm mesmerized each time. Antichrist feels incredibly long at a little over 100 minutes. Gainsbourg and Dafoe are game and the the film is a technical triumph. It's fascinating even though it doesn't really gel.",Antichrist
243,AdamVenrick,The Earth is Evil,10,1 June 2016,"Part one of Von Trier's ""Trilogy of Depression,"" immediately sets up the thesis statement which ""Melancholia"" later delivers. Namely: ""The Earth is Evil, and we shouldn't weep for its destruction. Now, let me be clear, I don't necessarily agree with this, but this movie is a notch (or seven or eight) above most modern horror movies. The film acts like a cross between Ingmar Bergman's existential films and Joyce Carol Oates' psycho-sexual horror novels. The film (much like ""Don't Look Now,"") is an exploration of the ghost of guilt. After the death of their child, an unnamed man and woman move to an isolated cabin in the woods where the evil of nature closes in on them. Stricken with abnormal grief, she begins to suffer a psychological breakdown, as he begins to witness terrifying hallucinations of the ""three beggars."" The film takes its horror from graphic sex and violence, while still being psychological enough to keep its monsters mostly hidden. He, who constantly clings to good and reason through the film, is ultimately unable to save his wife, and after administering a mercy killing, he walks up the hill and witnesses the apparitions of women walking up the hill towards him. What does that mean? It means that in spite of his rationality, he has come to the inevitable conclusion, just as she did, that the earth is in fact an evil place. And therein lies the true horror. The idea that life may be meaningless.",Antichrist

If the director intended to provoke us and provide us with grotesque themes to contemplate, then he has achieved his goal. However, if he truly wanted to explore fear or the 'evil' of women, he has failed spectacularly.He slyly indulges our desire for a catharsis till the very end, until we realize that their is no resolution, no grand commentary, just animal madness.Chaos reigns alright, though one wishes story did as well.",Antichrist
247,Riddlert,"Incredibly mind blowing, shocking, beautiful and boring.",6,16 December 2009,"Watching this movie, my expectations were high, as I like most of Lars von Trier's work. Kingdom and Dogvile is great works of art, while being very entertaining. Antichrist is perhaps more beautiful and artistic than those two put together, but not nearly as entertaining. When people say ""do not watch this, if you are sensitive to blood, sex and violence"" I brush it off, as I have never seen a motion picture that really shock me in any way, due to its graphical content. Until now that is. Apart from the very intense and very hardcore images, the feeling you leave the movie with, is one that will leave you thinking. I am not sure why it left such an impression on me, but I caught myself thinking about this movie, for weeks after watching it. It touches on evil and cruelty in a very direct and original way, without invoking anything supernatural or unbelievable.The problem with this movie is the VERY slow paste. I suggested to my friends, that we should stop watching it while just over the half-way point, but I am very glad we hung in there. All the good stuff is in the end. The last 15 min. is what makes this movie. They are exciting, entertaining, brutal, revealing, shocking and much more. Unfortunately only the first 5 and the last 15 minutes left any impression on me. The rest is simply to slow. Long slow-motion black and white scenes, without any real content, left me bored and even irritated. In conclusion, this is a movie unlike anything you have ever seen. It's more bloody and brutal than you expect, even after reading this. I would not let me children (if I had any) see this movie, before the age of reason. My good luck is that no children will ever make it to the hardcore scenes, as they would get bored to death before they got there. If you decide to watch this, brace yourself for a mind blowing experience, but be prepared for an evening of boredom.",Antichrist
248,thehellhole,"""Antichrist"" - The new fragrance by Lars von Trier",3,31 December 2009,"That's what I thought when I saw the artsy slo-mo epilogue. Pretentious advertising. The content is tragic (little son falling out of the window while his parents make sexy love in ze bedrum) but the way the scene is shot destroyed the emotional impact for me somehow. The brief in-and-out-porno-shot at the beginning is completely unnecessary by the way.The first time I saw von Trier's film I wasn't impressed at all. Nice eye candy but pretends to be more than it actually is. I had to re-watch it to confirm my opinion and to be able to structure my criticism. Von Trier is not a lazy moron, always puts a lot of work in his pictures, so I don't want to bash his efforts just to compensate for the loss of the money I paid to see the movie.But now it is not the time to be nice, so let's start with the smashy-smashy: Visually this movie is top-notch. Sound effects are excellent and the voices of the actors are impressive. Art direction is also superb. Willem Dafoe is a brilliant actor and the reason why I watched Antichrist in the first place. Well, that's all the praise I have to give.Now I want to concentrate on the bad parts: Pic is filled with a lot of pretentious, self-indulgent and forced scenes (in context), edited badly to great extent. The editing and jump cuts of this movie were the worst decisions the director made in my opinion, especially in the first two chapters. They took you out of the moment when the camera should have moved slowly. Very bad. Neurotic editing. I noticed this in detail the 2nd and last time I watched Antichrist (on DVD).The plot is too simple and illogical in places. A lot of dialogue is used to explain situations or actions we already have seen. Not very smart, although the movie pretends to be intellectual and highly symbolic. At the core, the concept of this film is misogynistic. Women are evil, want to have sex all the time, kill you if you leave them, laugh at you if you are impotent and are responsible for all the troubles in the world. They will burn in hell. Poor Lars von Trier. Maybe in your next life you'll be a porn star with a big penis and a lot of hair on your head. Then there is no time to be depressed.Charlotte Gainsbourg is an exceptionally unattractive woman. I always thought that and now Antichrist proves it. She looks like Joey Ramone, Iggy Pop and Patty Smith mixed together with a soft voice and well trimmed pubic hair. Skinny as hell and naked most of the time. Lars should have used a beautiful woman who plays a highly disturbed person and destroys her beauty piece by piece. That would have been to much greater effect.Here, sex & violence is for the sake of sex & violence. Not very subtle indeed, Mr. von Trier.Well, that's all I have to say about Antichrist. I confront myself a lot with art-house movies and most of them are garbage. Antichrist is not a complete drivel but also not worth your time. Sorry to say this, but in the end, Antichrist is a failure.",Antichrist
249,nicrok,'Antichrist': calm yet terrifying.,10,10 November 2009,"'Antichrist' is a disturbing and oddly calm ride for the adult mind.Disturbing due to its frequent scenes of violence and sexuality, which are as explicit as it gets. However, on the other hand, there are these beautiful, calm, surreal and peaceful moments of true art (e.g. the intro), suggesting a harsh contrast to the violence. As a matter of fact, it is them that rather contribute to the disturbing nature of the movie.This collision of the two countervailing extremes - the unsettling moments of violence and the awkward quiescence - is the essence of von Trier's horror. Through this surreality of his scenes, which definitely deserve to be called art, oddly unfamiliar emotions are evoked that will haunt you. Thus the graphic scenes are obligatory to his vision of dread - they cannot be expunged. Otherwise, the movie would lose its cunning and its strength. The clash of contrasts invokes a certain kind of mental discomfort, yet not necessarily - and this is the point - an unpleasant one.The story and its presentation deliver several points that cry for thorough analysis and interpretation; there are indeed various symbols and motives that recur throughout the movie.In my opinion, the allegations of being a misogynistic movie cannot be sustained. Von Trier's representatives of both genders contribute equally to the resulting catastrophe: arrogance, distance, and the denial of emotions of Willen Dafoe's male character eventually trigger the psychic meltdown of his female counterpart. Reflection and thought turn love into hatred. Significantly, the recurring motives of witchcraft and the malice of nature gain the meaning of catalytic devices through which grief and guilt of Charlotte Gainsbourg's character are being processed. Yet her proving to be incapable of processing her loss, and her having been challenged by depression in the past, grief turns into pain and despair, evoking paranoia, schizophrenia, and, ultimately, the desire to mutilate and kill.Not an easy movie of art that is worth the effort of viewing it.",Antichrist

254,gryspnik,We can speculate and hypothesize as much as we want. But this is the real meaning of the movie,8,9 November 2009,"The woman who was commissioned by L.V. Trier to do the research for the film writes: ""There is a very strong dichotomy between the rational male and the emotional, instinctive female in most of the film. Willem Dafoe's character is amazingly controlled in his approach to their shared tragedy, and how he finally lets go of that distanced and analytic position strikes me as one of the real highlights of the drama. To regard man as rational and in that sense 'complete' and woman as not actually in control of herself and therefore 'lacking' is a very old idea; it's been part of Western culture at least since Aristotle and was expressed very clearly by Otto Weininger as late as the early 20th century in his study of Sex and Character. I think Antichrist actually subverts that idea and in the end reveals how both woman and man are tied up with forces that go far beyond what they can or should rationally control.""

256,dixonbainbridgeisaledge,Wait and the laughs will come... but this is an awful film.,1,24 December 2009,"I have honestly never laughed so uncontrollably at a movie ever I think and I really didn't think I would say this about this movie. This movie amused in a way that no genuine comedy film ever could. This is everything that's wrong with movies today all wrapped up in a single film.From the very first minute you could tell that the director, Lars Von Trier, is so desperately fond of his own work that there were numerous long drawn out shots in black and white from strange angles and many really crazy cuts from scene to scene. The film was introduced with a really long black and white sex scene in super-slow-mo to Italian opera music. It's as pretentious as it gets. My friends and I were looking at each other in disbelief at the amount of slow motion used in this film.There were many scenes where you thought ""What's the relevance of this? I'll probably find out later."" Well, in this film you never do. So much of the film is done in slow motion and time feels like it's hardly moving for most of this film. The dialogue was really painful to listen to and if there had been no conversation in the whole movie it would hardly have made any difference. This film, though, obviously had a reasonable budget, but all the money and effort seems to have been spent on making the film look arty and sophisticated but this film lacked the basics: a decent story and decent dialogue.The two leading actors, Willem Defoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg, did a reasonable job with the terrible dialogue they had to wrestle with, along with the numerous graphic, gratuitous sex scenes and extremely graphic violence. Both of these features being very overused in order to sell what is an awful film. It was just to make the less discerning viewer, who doesn't interest him/her self much with the story, happy. However everything happened at such a painfully slow pace I can't imagine anyone being pleased with this. Some people just want to watch sex and violence. Well I wouldn't waste your time here then because you can find both much better elsewhere! However, with all the terrible dialogue, the painfully slow pace, the regular black and white super-slow-mo sex scenes, the super-slow-mo of someone walking on a bridge, the laughable scene with the crow (won't spoil it for you) etc etc, I actually just cracked and laughed so uncontrollably I cried for several minutes. The irony of so much effort going into this film's style to cover up how terrible it was, by a director who thinks so highly of himself and actually making a complete fool of himself with this skid-mark of a movie.My suggestion to you would be that if you want to see this movie, watch at speed x2. It will still be a slow movie and you won't miss much about the dialogue. There isn't much of it and what little there is is complete rubbish. You will however save about 52 minutes of your life. Just looking at the IMDb statistics I can't believe that the film was only 104 minutes long. It honestly felt like about 3 hours.Antichrist is a very slow, very boring, very pretentious and an utterly pointless movie.",Antichrist

The first two minutes, great, sets the tone and starts the plot. But then the film just becomes way too pretentious. My main beef with artsy films like this is, you can't just sit down and watch them. They're all too complicated. You should be able to sit down, watch it and enjoy it. Then later, watch it again and start to discovers the symbolism and all that stuff. The only highlights in the film was probably the last half an hour, when Charlotte Gainsbourg goes nuts. The images of the three animals and all of the women climbing on the hill is disturbing. Willem Dafoe does a great job, Gainsbourg was okay So, if you are a artsy guy or gal, you'll probably like this.

To each their own but personally this ranks on my top 10 least favorite movies of all time just for how empty and dull it is. And that's abnormal for Trier. You can say a lot of things about the guy's style but dull is usually not one of them.I have no issue with movies that build slowly as long as there's intrigue and there's just no intrigue there for me.That being said, the first five minutes are fantastic!

259,iamthebeatles,Not Recommended,1,4 April 2010,"First of all, allow me to state that I am a fan of avant-garde art. So I love films that shock. To give you an idea, some of my favorite filmmakers are Luis Bunuel, David Lynch, and Alejandro Jodorowsky.I was completely disappointed by Antichrist. I have an OK knowledge of psychology and I am interested in mysticism and this film--even though it looks poetic and seemingly deep because of the heavy symbolism--is shallow and boring. The characters seem unrealistic and the plot is not engaging. I find Lars Von Trier to be mentally ill and I think he needs medical attention. When a reporter at a press conference at Cannes asked Von Trier to explain his position on Antichrist, the Danish filmmaker became tense and in a self-defensive manner he replied that he's the best filmmaker in the world and that God is imperfect. How can I like a film the thesis of which is that Satan has created the world and there's no hope. It's basically the myth of Sisyphus.I had higher expectations of this film and it turned out to be a complete disappointment. It has no depth, no humor, no meaning... nothing. It's just painful. Painful and monotonous. And it's sad because the cast is great and the imagery is beautiful, but the screenplay is nonsense. And I say that even though I love dreamy or nightmarish films that function based on dream-logic. But this film had no logic, but that there's no hope in anything. Even though Von Trier might strike us as an atheist or something, but if he acknowledges good and evil and such forces then he's subconsciously referencing the Bible and to some extent he's support Christianity this way through his opposition of it: his anti-thesis.",Antichrist

So said John Waters. Amen.This isn't von Trier's best - Dancer in the Dark and Melancholia are my favourites - strange that they are both operas of a kind....OK - here's my interpretation - admittedly several months after seeing the film. The child is the Antichrist - what with its strange feet, its lack of injuries and its sly look before it jumps. Its death, chosen at the precise time (while parents are having sex) to generate the most guilt, self-reproach and confusion, tortures its parents and nurturers and brings about their downfall. In this it has its allies in nature.The death of the anti-Christ produces death, torture and sin (like the death and resurrection of the Christ brings life, joy and forgiveness). Its an interesting inversion. And proves that von Trier is a serious and original thinker. The images that stick in the mind - for me - are the child's odd, sly look before it jumps (how did von Trier capture that or engineer that? clever film-making). The fox growling 'chaos reigns' - a terrifying and convincing image. A deer jumping away with a stillborn fawn hanging limp from its vagina - an image that inspired more pity in me, than the horror or disgust I believe it was meant to inspire. Strangely the infinitely discussed self-clitoridectomy and the slightly ridiculous rooting at the roots of the tree have not remained with me, the former being just gross-out horror and the latter not a particularly striking or resonant image in this day and age of endlessly televised sexual activity. But, philosophically, I cannot agree with the equation of nature and evil, let alone women and nature and by extension evil. It seems to me to be simultaneously odious and arrogant for any person to assign any particular moral dimension to an entire sex let alone the natural world. But that's my belief, I suppose, my faith. 10/10 for filmaking 2/10 for philosophy ave = 6/10",Antichrist

263,luket,Do not be fooled by the hype.,1,14 August 2010,"It is with some regret that I have decided to spend time reviewing Von Trier's 'Antichrist'. I am, by nature a curious film watcher, and will, at times, succumb to temptation and reserve a couple of hours to cast my own opinion, when a film creates ample controversy. Thus far my curiosity, across the spectrum has been met with, elation and disappointment in equal measure.This is, and I make no apologies for this statement, a truly terrible film. I was hoping to read the user comments and be satisfied that it was met with the utter indifference and loathing that followed my own viewing and was genuinely shocked with the ridiculous ratings that have been pulled from the posteriors of those who mistakenly interpreted this dull and pointless movie as high art.Given that the acting was by no means sub par(Dafoe was very good as a husband/psychiatrist torn between his professional disposition and the demons of his relationship with his wife; and Gainsbourg was nothing if not committed to the role of a postnatally depressed lunatic) and the cinematography was at times excellent, it should give you some idea of how bad this movie was.One review entitled 'Canonical Sermon, Classical Hero Journey, Numeric Elegance and Name of The Beast' offered an academic dissection of the movie...referencing the film's numerical balance and some other contextual information that completely fails to justify the relevance and poor execution of this movie, which in principle, before pen hit paper, may have carried some merit and proved to be a dark and disturbing study of the human/inhuman condition.So, let me 'break it down' without offering insight where there is none or jumping on board the 'Turner Prize' high-art mindset that has corrupted modern art finding thought and intellect in the explicit and mundane.Firstly: This is NOT a balanced movie, no matter how Von Trier cuts the film into chapters. A nice prologue, followed by over an hour of self absorbed boring nothingness (aside from the revelation of child cruelty), climaxing in a violent last 10 minutes that arrived way to late for me to care about the resolution. Simply put, it is quite an achievement to bore someone to the point that genital mutilation, the ejaculation of blood the image of a wife fingering a freshly drilled hole in her husband's leg does not leave them shocked or a little sick; and yet I was so paralyzed by boredom that I was rendered immune to the horrors depicted on the television in front of me.It is all very well dissecting this movie for its symbolism and I am sure that for an academic essay it provides the necessary 'meat' for some critical analysis, but seriously, why bother when as a film, as a piece of entertainment, this movie fails at its most basic level.I have watched interviews with the cast, who really don't seem to understand the movie and listened to drivel about how this was a product of Lars' depression. The reality is that 'controversy' is the most marketable aspect of the film and one has to question the misogynistic stance/intentions of the movie. I am not a fan of feminism as it has moved beyond equality but it certainly wouldn't be too late to question Von Trier's relationship to the fairer sex, both in the context of this movie and his work as a whole.Imbalanced and a cry for attention; a cheap snub of mainstream Hollywood that craves the attention Von Trier claims to shun; or a failed art-house movie that owes its substance and form to antiquated intellectual study that it fails to properly address and far superior 'cabin in the woods' movies that it does not get close to matching....Take your pick of which best describes this terrible film.If you want cabin horror, watch 'Evil Dead'. if you like dark and harrowing try 'requiem for a dream'. There has been some talk as to the meaning of 'Antichrist' in the context of this movie. I can say with some certainty that it refers to the pure evil that stole 2 hours of my life last week. Damn you Lars Von Trier, you are an idiot.",Antichrist
264,doctorrugger,Gynocide,8,5 June 2009,"A -seemingly long- disturbing film.I was a great fan of the Master's first movies: The Element of Crime, Epidemics, Breaking the Wave ... when LVT was not yet recognized and acclaimed as the great Director he became. Though, I never left a movie theater after a LVT film vision without a lingering uneasiness, even some anxiety. Watching a film of Lars Von Trier is sometimes an ordeal, sometimes only painful and I fear so much his sharp and twisted mind that I never found the courage to go and see his last opuses.My vision of ""Antichrist"" is that a woman, beautifully played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, gets stuck into her own scholar subject while preparing a thesis about the evil done to women through history. As it happens sometimes, she begins to adopt the soul and spirits of the torturers. She becomes herself an evil woman, a kind of witch. But her personality is not one-faced; she develops a schizophrenic mind, being good or evil according to the moment, and nurturing a terrible guilt during her ""good"" phases.Could she have avoided her son's death ? Did she take part in this drama, or is it her guilt that makes her believes that she could/should have done something. What's sure is that she becomes more and more dangerous and that her husband has no solution to survive but to kill her.Obviously, I am sticking to one only of the subjects of this film; having seen it only once (and once will be enough)I don't pretend I can analyze the whole movie in depth, but I would be interested to see if some other IMDb critics share my view about the global idea.",Antichrist
265,benatarandres,Nature is Satan's Church,8,26 May 2016,"The term gynocide has several meanings regarding its misogynistic purpose. It can range from the slaughter of women for simply being women, or in some cases it can be perpetrated by women in support of male dominance. The bottom line all goes back to the inherent hatred of the female. Antichrist explores this concept within the supernatural. It tackles the long, and often disavowed issue of misogyny within our society, as well as our sacred texts. The film's early conception was meant for the idea of a world made not by god, but by Satan. Sadly that idea had to be discarded the moment Von Trier's producer decided to kiss and tell. But regardless of a dramatic rewrite, Von Trier had conceived an idea to which he can only he had said, came from ""A very sick mind."" Antichrist delves into the gender differences of male and female, evaluating the nature of women within the context of their historical representations throughout the centuries, posing the question about their portrayal, and the so-called purity a male dominant society expects from them. An unnamed married couple played only by Dafoe and Gainsbourg, with the rest of the cast's faces being blurred, lose their child as he jumps out the window. At the time they were passionately making love, slowly losing themselves in the ecstasy of their pleasure. Grief and guilt strike the wife brutally. Her husband, who is a therapist, takes it upon himself to treat her. Using psychotherapy, the wife confronts her fears in the place that brings out her more darker and animalistic side, a place called Eden. It is shown through slow motioned visions, her initial descent into this mysterious realm as she becomes one with nature and a much darker force that governs Eden. Instead of a garden, Eden is shown to be a small cabin within a forest, and in the course of the wife's recovery, decaying visions of nature and its grim depictions are shown, haunting the husband into questioning the meaning of these visions. Animals begins to envelop and represent a chaotic manifestation of the forest. There never is an explanation to who, or what controls this destructively portrayed force as it slowly begins to reign in maddening confusion among the husband and greater clarity among the wife. ""Nature is Satan's Church,"" ""The crying women is the scheming woman"", are several remarks made by the wife as she expresses her beliefs on women and the idea that they are inherently evil. The husband dismisses this as nonsense, equally expressing confusion at how anyone can bring themselves to believe women to be representations of evil. That was the dominant belief in Christianity for a long period of time, as women in the trials of Salem were executed for the crime of being women, alongside the imaginary basis of witchcraft being Satanic rather than that of a Pagan practice. The wife embraces this through her strange behavior, giving into her sorrow, while then reigning in a stream of malicious anger, cornering the husband into abandoning his reason and his empathy. One of the primary differences between men and women is that women are more emotional. Males have attributed this belief as a means of restraining their consistency with logic and rationality. The husband plays the intellectual, and the rationalist, ignorantly believing his wife's emotional expressions to be part of her fear of what she calls nature, and what he calls reason. One of the significant topics of the story is the patriarchal standards presented within the film. The husband character treats his wife out of empathy, using his logic and reason to reject the medical advice of doctors, regardless of his wife's own opinion. He deludes himself into believing that his wife's depression causes her to distort reality and her ability to be rational. But as random as her erratic and highly destructive behavior can be through sex or self-destruction, there is much more to be told through the decaying images of the forest and the unpredictable force of nature creating havoc that maybe there is a goal far beyond the wife's madness, and the husband's decaying reason. It was hard to tell at first, and after viewing the film a second time, it all became clear. Man, woman, it doesn't matter, we're all capable of becoming monsters, devoid of sanity or empathy. There has been some dispute as to whether Antichrist is a horror film. According to Von Trier he uses the horror genre as an inspiration, but regardless he doesn't consider it within that category. The film as disturbing as it is, is not meant to simply shock viewers. It is made in a manner that is meant to challenge our perceptions of how women are demonically portrayed in comparison to how they've been looked at towards in a male dominated society, through either out literature, our artwork, and mythologies. The use of Christianity is reversed in order to conceive an even greater revelation within the places of the male and female. Some will find it offensive, and misogynistic out of a misconception for the demonic portrayal of its female lead, and some will foolishly find it to be a pro-Satan film. Essentially there are many interpretations of the depiction of women within the film, and the portrayal from Charlotte Gainsbourg is enthralling to view. She captures the vulnerability and grief of her character, yet embodying a rage that is a representation of the anger women should have towards the idiotic patriarchal notion of male superiority, despite the sinister depiction she is given. But then again, according to Von Trier this all came from a ""Sick mind. And regardless of how strange society judges Von Trier's mental stability, he merely responds with a tint of his madness, as a way of showing how proud he is of his art style, as well as his interpretation of how women have been portrayed for centuries as a means of liberating them past those restrictions.",Antichrist
266,writeagain,Trier's Idiots Come Back!,3,30 August 2009,"You might remember LTV's film ""Idiots"". Now this film is about a couple with seemingly higher IQ but as parents and partners they are not much brighter than those mentally handicapped people. Any mother, real mother, not someone from Trier's sick fantasy, would call Charlotte's protagonist an idiot, plain and simple. So if there's any moral in this film, then it might be a revelation only for idiots again. Tarkovsky may be Trier's favourite author but Tarkovsky was way more discrete about sex and violence. His actors played, suffered but didn't scream in the woods or mutilate each other. ""Antichrist"" with all its brutality just proves the impotence of the modern Western art-house cinema that is so shallow, so morally empty that the only way to attract the attention is to add some torture porn and a talking fox. Well done, Lars, but did you talk to Marilyn Manson? He can teach you some more tricks.",Antichrist
267,sljohnson12,Rewriting Genesis,10,25 October 2009,"An Exploration of The Most Controversial Film in Decades In what will be marked in history as one of the most controversial, literally pornographic & thought provoking pieces of art within the film medium, Lars von Trier has presented an anomaly questioning the foundations of religions themselves, as well as an experience to enmesh the audience well into the film. From practically every facet of quality, Antichrist excels in all areas: Regarding special effects, film grain & use of colours; image filtering, characters, soundtrack, artistic literary techniques; dialogue & themes with direct connotations towards the human condition. This is naming but a few of a potential from a most complex myriad.What will dissuade viewers is first & foremost the sexual content & violence. Albeit there is little to no actually violence throughout the film, many entrails & rotting corpses are wont to appear throughout the film. Fortunate for fans of indulgent exploitation flicks like the Saw series (2004-2009) there are a few scenes that they would find most enjoyable. The most brutally sadistic scene is the well sculpted climax, leading to such a poignant pinnacle. The protagonists, He & Her, are revealed early to be some sort of representation, metaphor or analogy for the story of Adam & Eve. The denouement is, in itself, as meaningful as the climax.Again, however, other things present that may be of no interest to a viewer are the pace of execution & the slow, nonchalant style. Focusing on a significant lot of aesthetically pleasing shots, playing shots heavily edited to seem surreal when shot in slow motion. It recalled Alejandro González Iñárritu's Babel (2006), in which the scenes where Brad Pitt & Cate Blanchet are traveling filmed with a breezy, patient pace. The camera often pans slowly, or zooms in quickly during intense scenes to inspire such immense pathos. The characters themselves that are injected with such utterly human logic, feelings, anxieties, panic; all exemplified & elucidated clearly be means of talents of each actor.Released in Denmark, it is in due likelihood against favors of having this film put in theatres across America. Realize it is not so much the subject content – inquiry into religion & witnessing the progress & downfalls-as it is the unwavering camera. In conjunction with the image filter that highlights warmer, bright colours & white, we feel as if we are there. A pseudo-voyeuristic feel, with extremely thought provoking subjects for debate presented. Antichrist is not by any means endorsing anything other than what you believed given all the themes, motifs, hints, metaphors & clues upon leaving the theatre. In fact, in concerns to religion & Christianity & Antichrist, specifically, the more well educated an individual is the more well understood are the relations to the human condition. On contraire not meant to offend any religious people aside from a few wonderments regarding ""Satan,"" The only cons conceived, save for the pace & content, is that of one scene an hour & ½ in. The film spontaneously switches to the paradigm of the conventional orthodox psychological thrillers, similar to M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense (1999). Use of soundtrack can be likened to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). Allusions are present, whether intentional or coincidence. This brings forth a notice concerning the notion of genres.Considered by the Mass Mainstream Media (MSM) to be a horror or a drama, the array of subject matter provided within the movie far expounded upon any doubts of limitations. Given I was able deduce a list of themes: We can never escape decay; acceptance of fate; lust & carnal desire; Eden; the loss of innocence, exposure to sin & effects of sin- masochism, sadism & self-mutilation. The film begins as a drama, the progresses to become a surreal mystery psychological thriller with horror elements aimed at the higher age demograph.The ending is so poignantly haunting & so very graphically rendered as to make one hard pressed to not cringe. This is far beyond Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange or the French films Man Bites Dog & Irreversible. However, stripped of its delving into religious metaphysical indulgences, Antichrist is an extremely well directed & acted drama albeit not one that standalone with warrant a great movie. You always get out of a film what you put it, so depending on how much time one wants to spend contemplating on abstract notions, the more appreciative they will be of the film. Although, objectively speaking no other film will ever surmount to the infallible depth of this piece, in direct concerns to the subject matter being the human condition.2009 Sam Johnson",Antichrist

I hadn't read any reviews, i actually wasn't aware it was a horror film.It starts off with beautiful but sad and horrific event and goes into a psychological exploration of the mother's grief for an hour or so. Until the moment in the cabin when things turn violent. I had been lulled in by the first hour of the movie so didn't expect it- and when I say violent- i mean blood and sex all mixed with mutilation- I thought oh it's only this once. But it kept on coming-more and more violence and in the most painful ways imaginable. I had to shut the DVD off- I was white as a sheet. Staggering to the toilet- I vomited, literally- not from anything I'd eaten but just the movie. In my way i threw up on a spider- so there were actual fatalities thanks to this film (RIP spidy)... I'm not squeamish but it was just so surprising! All i can say is -Thanks a lot Lars!",Antichrist

270,cebelina,A thought provoking movie of the horrors of self-loathing and misogyny.,8,31 January 2014,"Spoiler Alert! Whew! I won't recommend this movie with an exception of a very few folks who have very open minds. NOTHING IS EASY about this movie. Scenes are horrific taking every bit of tolerance to suffer through. Compelling, disturbing and frustrating ""Antichrist"" demands thought. Obvious themes are: 1.) Destruction in the Act of Creation 2.) Self Loathing 3.) Break Down of the Family Unit 4.) Psychiatry as a Destructive Force and also a Creative Force. Misogynistic overtones are rife. Our antagonist is a woman perpetuating misogyny through self-loathing. Don't jump to the conclusion that von Trier is misogynistic. Our character doesn't think at the beginning of her journey that she has a dislike for her own kind; quite the opposite. Darkening influences of her mind/illness and her environment twist her reality into one of such hatred she perceives it as evil. The ticks fox and the deer tempt us. We wonder where we stand in this forsaken gloom. The intense dislike of what inner hatred can do/be is often a self -loathing we all have. Rarely do we lose our grip as much as our antagonist does. This is what a single germ of misogyny and an evil mindset can become; ruthlessly, twisting the mind with self-hate shown at its worst. In psychosis, we watch as our main character disintegrates. We are tempted to believe in this misogyny as our ""She"" compels us to see and also as our ""He"" sees the 3 Beggars too. My belief is that it is the three beggars or his/her instinct that is warning him/her/us of impending danger; what the damage of self -hate can do. ""Antichrist"" is a metaphor for what our ""She"" refuses to see. Hate of women/self only brings about bad things. It is a darkness from which the forest of our primeval brain seems unwilling to let go. Capturing us like the 3 Beggars: Grief, Despair and Pain. The forest is dark and tangled as our Human Condition. The 3 Beggars bring us nothing but misery. In the final scene we see a horde of women approaching our ""He."" None of them hurt our ""He"" they walk beyond him. Walk beyond the Three Beggars as our ""He"" leaves the Darkness of the Forest of Misogyny. He steps into the light away from his living hell from which all men die. A raging example of Self Loathing is rarely as provocative as this; if one scratches beyond the horrific images and follows our ""hero"" out of the misogynistic forest, like our hero we find there is a bit of light to be found.",Antichrist
271,whitezombie-43417,"Terrible waste of time, mostly sex scenes, nothing happens",1,21 July 2015,"I can truly say that I just wasted 2 hours of my life. Don't let the actors in this movie fool you. Just because a movie has ""good"" actors in it doesn't mean he movie will be good. Just look at the budget and the revenue... Now let me explain why you shouldn't also waste 2 hours of your life. This is one of those movies where you are waiting for stuff to happen and the 'pace' to pickup (if you can even say this movie has any) and it just never does.When you start the movie you are left watching a scene in black & white for 5 minutes that just has some music playing in the background and things going on that you don't need to see (detailed sex scene). It could have easily been acted out in 15 seconds or less and that would be that.Next, another 1 hour and 25 minutes or so goes by where you are left waiting for something to happen. Now the weird part about this is at this point in the movie someone has just done something crazy... You would think that would cause some interest but the movie is just so quiet and boring that it does not even peek any interest. It isn't until someone is 'running' away and they find something that gives any interest.Then the last 20-30 min of the movie go by and you are left wondering again is something going to actually happen to make it a movie (at this point does it really matter?)or is nothing going to happen except pictures moving across the screen with some sound... Well you guessed it nothing interesting happens. Sure something happens to someone but even then at this point in the movie you are probably wondering why you even bothered to watch it and are just so bored it doesn't even mean anything.I don't know about you but when I see a title like 'Antichrist' I think about something scary. This movie isn't scary nor should it be titled anything to label it that. If I had to name it I would pick something that describes the title as quiet, boring, and a lot of sex scenes {IF you watch it you'll see what I mean).Anyways, I am not that great at writing reviews but I thought at least for this movie I would try to write one because someone deserves to see a bad review so maybe they might just not watch it like I did.",Antichrist

The acting was also impressive (especially regarding Charlotte Gainsbourg's performance, which was the most demanding out of the two).In terms of the screen play I was frankly not impressed. The characters were under developed and much of the dialogue is devoted to boring psycho-babble. The story had potential but plot revelations are not given enough attention in terms of build up and execution - breezed over to make way for more fluffy camera work.Apart from a couple really severe displays of ultra realistic gore (seriously...ouch!), I wouldn't call this a horror movie. It lacked tension and I frankly didn't think enough of the characters to be concerned for their well being. That being said the score was great, probably would have suited a scarier film.All in all, I'd say this is a movie that the 'film noir' enthusiasts will wet their pants over but I wouldn't be inclined to recommend it for anyone else.",Antichrist

275,edula,Chaos reigns supreme!,10,19 August 2009,"Trier can do no wrong - it's official! It's been a long time since something so gorgeous and yet so confrontational was among us, dividing the critics straight down the line (although, as expected, The Guardian likes it whilst The Times wants it banned). Beautifully shot on the new Red One camera, showing that digital does not have to be the poor relative to film, and hopping from haunting, painterly scenes to hand-held shakiness, this is, IMHO, far closer to a work of art than it is to a horror film. That said, it is creepy as hell, a feeling accentuated by the wonderful sound design, with the creaking cabin at 'Eden', with the acorns rattling off the roof, and unsettling, droning orchestral soundtrack. And yes, some of the scenes are very graphic, but never is it gratuitous. Without these scenes (which have been discussed at length elsewhere), the ever-growing dread that builds throughout the film would not have been given any further avenues to explore, and we would have been left with a dull thud rather than a crescendo. 'Antichrist' is, in part, about the extremes of emotions, and how far they can be pushed. It is only fitting that, in order to truly appreciate these emotions, the viewer has to travel along the same paths as the characters.As for those that claim ""Antichrist"" is further evidence of Trier's hatred towards women? Well, it seemed clear to me that all sympathy and humanity went to the 'She' character, and Charlotte Gainsbourg's wonderful and brave performance, scratching at the skin of despair and madness, is the emotional centre of this film. Not to discount from Willem Dafoe in any way - his portrayal of the self-serving, self important 'He' was equally powerful, and I feel neither of the actors would have pulled off such astonishing performances were it not for their full understanding of each others roles, and their respect for each other and the director.",Antichrist

277,grahamyounie,One of the worst films of 2009,3,21 January 2010,"Antichrist received much controversy upon its release. Disgusted viewers were walking out of screenings not halfway through the movie. Those that watched until the end were divided. Some thought it a masterpiece, others thought it was a pretentious bore fest. This was a similar reaction to 2008's French masterpiece, Martyrs. Antichrist, in my mind, is no masterpiece. Far from it.I knew this movie might not appeal to me when I sat down to watch it, but when a film divides so many critics as this did, and when so much controversy is put upon a film, my curiosity to see it for myself is too much to resist. Lars Von Trier directed this film and he is not to everyones tastes. For example, his 2003 Nicole Kidman film Dogville was set entirely on a stage, so it felt like watching a stage production rather than a traditional film. He is a very experimental director and sometimes this comes at the cost of entertaining his audience, as is the case here. This film is just not entertaining enough to hold interest.The story involves a couple played by Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg. Their baby son dies at the beginning of the film and the rest of the film focuses solely on these two people and their emotions and their turmoils following on from their sons death. They retreat to an unoccupied woodland cabin where things start to slowly turn ugly between them.The acting from both lead actors is very good. It needs to be as they are both the sole occupants of this film for the majority of its running time. Unfortunately, the way the story is told and the events that unfold are very tedious and very, well boring frankly. I can see why there were walkouts. Aside from the slow and boring progression of the story, it also changes gears toward the final 3rd and descends into shock tactics. I won't go into details but extreme nudity and violence play a strong part. Two scenes in particular will make both male and female audiences either look away or squirm in their seat.What I was left feeling after watching Antichrist was how boring it was. I wanted to fast forward scenes, I wanted the story to be less pretentious. It's as if the director had a nightmare and he woke up and decided to he was going to turn it into a film. This could be partially true as I've read that the film is partly based on the directors thoughts and feelings during a period of depression.If you want to be depressed, and bored at the same time, this is for you.

What is actually scary in gore? Yes of course it is scary if you happen to be the actual victim, but otherwise...? This film is a good counterbunch for these American horrors where naked woman is a really bad and censored thing, unless the woman is dead and on the operating table. Isn't it actually more natural to show some skin on living beings than dead ones - I wonder? For some this Antichrist might be too much because it is not entertaining at all, it is mostly disturbing and sometimes beautiful, but not entertaining.

Think Joe Lieberman, Sarah Palin, Lars Von Trier. Von Trier deserves respect in that his movies are made out of inner compulsion, no cheap commercialism or glibness, and for his willingness to take rebarbative chances in both form and content. But the downside of his desperation, coming from his limited insight and reason, is a nasty self-righteousness both ham-handed and whingy. AntiChrist is rotted through with Von Trier's purblind terror. He attempts to defang his demons by making audiences share his pain until we will agree with his perception of the horrors lurking in everyday life and of what we need to do to protect ourselves from them. The result is a dreary, painted-by-the-numbers, horror gross out, cobbled for those who need their catechism ketchuped up, thuddingly portentous, and grotesquely disgusting. The opening scene--or Prologue as its entitled to help the audience grasp that pearls are being cast to us--is uberschmaltzy, shot in luscious black and white (even the laundering diapers look dreamy), slow-mo, tricked up with ukiyo-e porn, Gesualdoish descant, and sex windowing death. Promising elements but over-amped so that every frames rings as phony. Cut to the lovers Technicolor--deftly shrinking the couple from the mythic stature of the black and white into ordinary neighbors--but, instead of giving us the complexity of real people, Von Trier subjects us to a pair of stultifying sock-puppets. A Rachel of insufferable grief, played by the aptly catarrhal Charlotte Gainsborough, whose mucus-dripping whispering is geared to make you feel guilty about wanting to strangle her, with her central casting sawdust-for-brains therapist husband, played by winsome Willem DaFoe so woodenly loving and earnest as to make an addled viewer nearly look beyond the horror of his wife--at least that's what Von Trier is counting on, but it's a gamble he loses to anyone paying attention. As luck would have it, the urban man and wife have a backcountry bungalow lost in primeval woods to which they repair to heal, in nature's bosom as it were. But wait! Do the menacing trees, eerie fauna, and disorienting camera work mean that the couple will cut loose along exactly the not-too-well-hidden dotted lines that they were mechanically constructed to demonstrate? The answer will come as a surprise only to those who find Judy falling out with Punch a dramatic revelation. But what will impress everyone--painfully--is the deliberately disgusting and grotesque sadomasochism that Von Trier feels justified in bludgeoning us with. Ah, that old time religion, and the fire-breather's sacred duty to purge and edify the spirits of his flock by jabbing the torments of flesh and bone into our bleeding eyes. A must see for those who look forward in naive optimism when a splintering couple retreat to a place they've christened Eden, who seek tutelage in hating women, and who find still fresh the interplay of flesh and garden tools.",Antichrist

And it's incredible.Both Gainsboirg and Dafoe are great here. They are very dedicated to their roles, as you see in several seen including the opening scene. Sometimes, the gore in a horror movie can seem dumb and poorly made. But the cinematography in Antichrist is all but Poor and dumb.

This is definitely a must see movie - if not for anything else, then at least for the splendid acting performances and the absolutely genius photographing.

289,lombano,"some interesting aspect, but pretentious and manipulative",6,26 October 2009,"This is a pretentious film, with its Biblical title, and multiple Bibical allusions ('Eden,' to name an obvious one) - this distracts from the actual central drama and its psychological aspects. The very directness of some scenes also reeks of a director that is showing off how liberated or daring he is; some scenes are meant to shock for the sake of shocking, while pretending to be profound. Still, it's very effective at creating a mood of constant unease and the shockers are at least shocking.The best aspect of the film in my view is the portrayal of nature as something profoundly evil, characterised by brutality, death and madness - a refreshing break from the trite Bambi-style portrayal of nature as harmonious and benevolent. I view nature as brutal and amoral but not evil, but I still find it an interesting take, achieved mostly (though not entirely) with realistic nature scenes, which adds to its effectiveness.The film has been criticised as misogynous - my take on it is that this is about one particular woman, and about embracing an extreme misogynistic world-view to both get attention and escape personal responsibility. It does not follow it's meant to apply to all women.Despite the title, it is possible to view this film as entirely non-supernatural and about insanity and/or (worldly) evil, largely depending on whether certain scenes are interpreted as real, hallucinations or allegories of what is going on inside the character's mind.",Antichrist

From the first minute of the film you can't take your eyes of the screen, your entranced. The acting is absolutely sublime. William Dafoe is a well established actor but decided to go for this risky, very sexual role and should be praised for that. The female actress also delivers an amazing performance. There is a lot of symbolism in the film. The deer with the half dead deer sticking out of itself i think represents the mother not being able to let go of her dead son. The fox eating itself i think is also the mother eating away at herself who wont let go of the guilt of her son's death.Understandably there will be people who won't like this film but its one for me that it was at least new and different. The gore didn't bother me but it was much more realistic than any saw or hostel film and you could almost feel the pain. Most of the cinema squirmed.

Removed from distractions of civilization the characters are increasingly reduced to pure instinct which results in tragedy. Man prevails because of his physical strength, not because he's right.Antichrist is nature, or more specifically the gap between the nature of men and women resulting in their inability to truly understand each other. That gap is where evil comes from, that's the Antichrist, that's the gynocide.I thought the graphic scenes are used well and result exactly in emotional response movie is supposed to evoke.

Anyone who is familiar with the work of early 1970's French filmmakers will find connections to previous productions, but Von Trier artistically brings his vision to life through the visceral and occasionally hard to watch violence and explicit content. *A child falls out of an open window and dies while his parents are having sexual intercourse. Grieving for the loss of their son, the wife has a nervous breakdown at the funeral and is admitted to the hospital. Not trusting the doctors' ability to treat psychological disorders, the husband (a professional therapist) brings her to their cabin retreat in the forest of Eden and attempts to perform a psychoanalysis on her, with terrifying results.*Even if you are not a huge fan of gore, you will still find yourself captivated by the imagery in ""Antichrist"". The first scene is a masterpiece, shot entirely in black and white, slow motion, and featuring a classical music score. The last half hour of the movie contains what is perhaps the most shocking and breathtaking examples of rising action in the past decade. This film is in NO WAY appropriate for anyone under the age of 18.

Frankly, neither is true. This is a profoundly muddled film whose few shocking moments have little impact on the (threadbare!)story and make me think of it as an also ran in the Grimm fairy tale book.Curiosity seekers aside, just don't bother with this.

302,kircharles-1,"Civilization, inside-out",10,7 September 2009,"Just arrived from AntiChrist screening. At some point wondered whether Von Trier became closer to David Lynch. Just to the extent to make a movie appealing to our symbolic grammar. This movie makes several symbols and myths alive: the connection between ""women"" and ""evil"", ""women"" and ""nature"", and ""evil"" and ""nature"", as well as the connection between ""rationality"" and ""men"", hence ""good"" and ""men"", as far as transition through Ancient Greece and early Christianity concepts goes. ""Nature"" (as opposed to rationality) is stronger and overcomes man's attempt to tame evil. But when ""therapy"" is ""beyond good and evil"", all Nietzsche's Pandora box is open (through the front door, welcome by Freud himself). Taming cannot be entirely free of risk: therapeutic process exposes the inner darkness. And darkness here is not just ""evil"", as we could be tempted to think from the first scene (a child's accidental suicide, due to his mother's carelessness), but just a hard-core-tragedy clothed in the necessary original-sin; needed, to be sure, to set the gears of tragedy in motion. Self- forgiveness is impossible, which unfolds self-harming, castration and self-castration. Man cannot believe that Woman is evil. It ought to be the other way around: she must enlighten us on how the imputation of evil to women is false. But evil becomes real, concrete, palpable. As ""goodness"" suddenly fades away. She is disposable. The tragedy ends with the Man killing the Woman and burning her corpse. All symbols well tamed scream to live: the witch is burning, cleansing from evil, darkness and impurity. Yet we arrive horrified at such brutality, we observe our man calmly walking through nature, taking from it his nourishment. Finally tamed. A flow of women through nature. A flow of murders in order to sustain civilization.",Antichrist

However, if you can stomach all of that and you are willing to invest in a lot of symbolism and suggestive imagery then there is a lot of to be taken from viewing Lars Von Triers 'Antichrist'. Some of the cinematography is superb and the acting (while deeply disturbing) is also excellent. I don't think I'll ever be able to watch Charlotte Gainsbourg in anything else without wincing.

While the film itself was a subject of controversy and very polarizing, no-one can deny the brilliant performances from Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg (who went on to win Best Actress at Cannes) and the strikingly beautiful camera-work, direction and cinematography. Trier acknowledges his influences by dedicating the film the great Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky, replicating his images of beauty and surrealism, but with new filming technologies like digital video, visual effects and clearer picture.Be warned, there are scenes of genital mutilation, unsimulated sex, violence and disturbing imagery. It may sound unwatchable but the scenes aren't as graphic as they sound and when they are graphic, it is brief.The film begins with the unnamed couple engaging in intercourse while showering. Unknown to them, their infant son climbs out of his cot and onto the windowsill. He falls and dies while the couple are shown in sexual climax. After the tragedy, the couple go to their cabin 'Eden' in the woods to overcome their grief. As the film progresses the female character begins to become more and more erratic while the male character struggles to keep her sanity intact. But, as it is suggested by the title, there is an evil in the woods manipulating the couple.Antichrist is a film about suffering in the forms of Grief, Pain and Despair (the titles of three of its chapters) and ultimately escape.

In order to appreciate what this film is all about you need both an open mind and some pedigree from as well film as literature and theatre.I am absolutely fascinated by the reviews I have read on IMDb. Is there a statistic over how often a film scores both 1 and 10? Clearly, Antichrist has evoked some emotions in people, even if they were negative displays of panicky defence - a phenomenon I'm familiar with from theatre productions - so it definitely deserves to be called ""controversial"".In my opinion, Antichrist portrays human nature -- with the visceral power of the greatest authors from history -- and it does so with tenderness and beauty, if not outright love, even when said nature is at its most horrific. We are no worse than animals, but no better either. In fact we ARE animals.Strongly recommended!

He would be incapacitated for sure and certainly not able to walk about and then kill his wife. Also there is the fact that late on in the film you see the wife watching her son crawl towards the window and fall to his death. Even though she is having sex with Dafoe, any parent would have stopped and ran after their son! And what about the wind that would be blowing through the house form having the window open?

Firstly.........I had to watch this movie in two parts as after the prologue, which grabbed my attention, music, gratuitous sex scene, nicely shot, stomach churning opening, it went completely downhill! I watched for a further 50 or so minutes before ending up turning it off and going to bed, utterly disappointed with the dialogue, talking fox, dodgy camera work when the two characters were having 'dialogue' which to be frank could have been filmed better on a camera phone! I'd had enough! After two days and the threat of my husband deleting it from my sky box I decided to give the final part a go........ Well I'm just wondering at what point does a clear psychotic with a hatred to all men suddenly find itself in the 'horror' genre? There were a couple of fine moments where I thought 'BLIMEY!' or 'that was good' but seriously............What WAS the point of this movie....at all??? I have no doubt in my mind that talented Willem Dafoe and the handful of defining BLIMEY moments cannot make up for the rest of this atrocity! Watch, and make up your own mind by all means, but seriously, I could think of far better ways to spend my time than to watch a cock spewing blood and a woman cutting off her own clit with scissors with some weird message about the 'sister-hood'",Antichrist
312,sirwootalot,Impossible to summarize; see this film as soon as possible if you enjoy a challenge.,8,27 October 2009,"I just finished watching this film a few hours ago, and all I know for sure is that it's one of my all-time favorites. Don't get me wrong; it's abhorrently disgusting and the morals go completely against basic human compassion, but that's exactly the point. The ultimate judge of a work of art, in my opinion, is the strength of one's emotional reaction to it - be it sadness or joy, appreciation or revulsion. The feeling the film left with me was not unlike one Gainsbourg's character expresses towards the middle; ""everything that used to be beautiful was perhaps hideous"". I cannot understate this enough: as far as cinematography goes, with the exception of a few deliberately repulsive shots in the latter half, Antichrist is one of the fifteen most visually gorgeous films I have ever seen. The dream/thought sequences that crop up every now and again are close to poetry in motion.Another thing I can't understate is that, as gorgeous as the film is, it is even more repulsive. The ""moral of the story"" is ethically repugnant, and unless you can completely immerse yourself in the film and forget about your own personal ethics, you will be deeply offended. The final third of the film is truly pure insanity, and there were two particular moments that nearly prompted me to stop watching, if only to escape the enormous disgust they evoked in me.I would love to give this film a higher score, but as beautifully executed as it is, it could have been so much richer. The plot underlying the madness within the final third is weak at best and corny at worst, and the psychology that so heavily dominates most of the film is temporarily set aside right at the moment where it would be the most compelling.",Antichrist
313,reinholdfilm,Von Trier Masterclass,9,21 May 2009,"First I have to make a comment to cynibun from United States who wrote ""And if you look at the previous reviewers they are from Denmark, where the director is from. Perhaps you have to be Danish to appreciate the horrific torture pornography, who knows??... Americans have more sense thankfully, and do not call everything art simply because the director is foreign."" I have no idea why it should matter where the other reviewers are from. That has nothing to do with ""Antichrist"" as a film. Some like it and some don't, no matter what country they are from. If I don't like an American film I don't go out and bash on reviewers from America and then state that Danes have more sense - what's that all about? Sense of what? Personally I don't think it makes much sense making movies like ""American Pie"" or ""Hannah Montana"", but hey, they produce the films anyway - maybe because they have more sense. Hannah Montana makes a LOT of sense... And you don't have to come from Denmark to like ""Antichrist"" (though it is a very constructive statement), I'm guessing there is one or two people from Russia or Poland who likes the film also...Back to Lars Von Trier and ""Antichrist"". First of all - I don't know why everybody keeps saying this film is a gore fest. ""Uhhh it's so brutal, violent and extremely gory"". What? Okay, there's more blood than in ""Hannah Montana"" but if ""Antichrist"" is a sick and gory film, I don't know what you would call films like ""Ichi The Killer"", Naked Blood"", ""Inside"" and ""Audition""? There is more blood/gore in ""Se7en"" than in ""Antichrist"" (or maybe the same amount), so I don't know what all the fuzz is about... Anyway... I loved the film!!! When I left the theater I didn't know quite what to think, but it grows and becomes better and better. It's a fantastic work of art, the cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle is amazing and the whole feel of the film is both beautiful and scary at the same time. Willem Dafoe is at his best in this one.I guess you have to have an open mind when watching this. The film does not give any answers and is rich on symbolism - guess one could call it ""experimental horror-drama"". Lars Von Trier is back in his hypnotic visual style and mindfuc*ing storytelling, and this is where he is best! Not a film for the mainstream audiences, but I recommend it if you have an open mind and want something new and different, and have (almost) as much sense as Americans.",Antichrist
314,Fafane_Lenerf,Must see!,10,19 October 2009,"I read no reviews whatsoever before seeing this film. Do the same! Do not let anyone ruin it for you.Stop reading this and see the movie.Still here? Fine. Most ""professional"" reviews I have read since leave me to believe most of them have not watched the same movie as I. Many are completely clueless as pertains to plot and themes! Some reviewers just seem to shy away from it as too controversial.You will not come away from this movie unaffected. I felt like I had just undergone a very real trauma after my first viewing. Please do not let the ""Horror"" tag on this movie affect your decision to see it. This is NOT a Horror Movie... Violence does not equal Horror. The film is a very disturbing psychological drama. A look into our very human depths...Go see the movie and form your own opinion, but go see it.",Antichrist

316,bill-mellor,Very poor,1,14 September 2009,"I was disgusted by significant elements of the film. By the groans in the cinema so were a significant proportion of the rest of the audience. Notably on a peak Saturday it got a thin audience in the first place so there weren't that many to upset. I think some behind me walked out.The porno items you can live with and just wonder if you have wandered into this week's seedy film by mistake. But the gore and generally disgusting moments etc are just not acceptable and certainly not anything other than for weirdos. Nothing the director has done previously prepares you for this.The plot, the inexplicable names for the film sections, and indeed the overall title, add nothing either. Sorry all, but bottom marks for this.",Antichrist
317,J-krazy,Chaos Reigns with The Three Beggars...,9,5 August 2009,"The story is very basic, the mother is struggling to get over her grief of losing their son, and very fittingly Defoe's character is a psychologist and decides to go to the cabin at Eden to conquer her fears in an attempt to make her 'better'. The film is divided into four chapters, ""Grief"", ""Pain (Chaos Reigns)"", ""Despair (Gynocide)"" and ""The Three Beggars"". With a prologue and epilogue at the start and finish. I knew I was in for a wild ride at the prologue. It was shot beautifully in black and white, in slow motion, with an operatic song playing over it, like some prestigious big budget commercial, until Von Triers flips it on it's head with a reasonably lengthy shot of actual penetration during the sex scene. The film itself as mentioned is beautifully shot, the cinematography gorgeous and the camera work outstanding. Everything about the film is top notch. Its an absolute treat to watch. As the summary suggests, things go from bad to worse. I wont say anymore of what happens from there, as it's a fairly slow moving film, and knowing too much of what unfolds could potentially ruin the experience. Gore hounds will probably be disappointed, as will your casual horror fan. But fans of David Lynch and surrealist cinema need to check this out. My prediction is, those that enjoyed Friedkin's Bug should enjoy this.For a cabin in the woods type horror film, its far from what we're used to. It's a nightmarish psychological hell, set up perfectly with slow warping pans of the woods, and an eerie score that certainly gives a nod to Lynch himself. The sense of ominous dread is captivating and overwhelming. As with a lot of surrealist films, the movie asks a lot of questions, and answers very few. There is a pad load of melon scratching moments, that I haven't even begun to work out yet, so expect lots of WTF moments. The film is very explicit, there's a lot of nudity, and what violence there is, is done very well. Animal lovers need to take heed going into this one, as nothing or no-one is spared. The film at its core, deals with the natural human instinct to be evil, but I digress. And lastly, the word 'art' is used a lot when describing this film, and I wont be one to disagree. It is an artistic vision absolutely, and I respect Von Trier for having the grapes to make this movie. We need more like it.",Antichrist
318,opulentus7,Lard von Trash,2,19 September 2009,"von Triers has missed the mark on this one. Yes there are details that people can discuss. But the story was one that had me thinking, ""Why did he write this crap?"" Great effects, slow motion, etc. The acting was good. But how do you act out a bad story? If this were a painted art piece, I'd describe it as someone taking the paint in his/her mouth, puking it on to the canvas, passing it off as a masterpiece, attracting certain intellectuals holding wads of cash.The horror and shock was there but it just didn't work for me, because of the awful story.And von Triers dedicated this to Andrei Tarkovsky? Well, I think that Tarkovsky should probably be reborn as the Antichrist, come AFTER von Triers and that could become a hit... based on a true story.Straight to the Recycle Bin with this one, selecting Erase Recycle Bin (35-Pass Gutman). 1 star, with an extra star for great effects.",Antichrist
319,astonfilms,An Ineffective Mess,3,30 October 2009,"The sad thing about Lars Von Trier's ""Antichrist"" is that it is an ineffective mess. The film had me leaving the theatre thinking for hours of not what it meant but why it was such an ineffective mess. The truth is that I'm still trying to piece that together but I've come up with some heavy verdicts. Von Trier has proved that his strength is manipulating our emotions and leading us through painful journeys to an emotional, honest climax or catharsis. ""Breaking The Waves"" is possibly a masterpiece because of this effectiveness. Later films like ""Dancer in the Dark"" and ""Dogville"" aspire to this as well. There is something to be said about the scaled down quality and ""Dogme95"" honesty that he has worked with. These are the films he was meant to make. He is in way over his head with a film such as Antichrist. He teases us with developing this interesting relationship with He and She. While I was a bit bored with the earlier development, it looked as though we were going to explore the emotionally naked territory he has led past actors into which is thrilling to watch. Instead, he begins to throw crazy visuals at us like the body parts sprouting through a tree, a talking fox proclaiming ""Chaos Reigns""(WTF), a deer running away in the middle of giving birth, and more. What I was at least looking for here was for a developed connection between these wild visuals and the emotional honesty of the characters but there was obviously none and really no point to these visuals as they really don't make any connection other than to be jarring and sometimes cool-looking effects; whereas someone like a Kubrick would have found a way to connect these visuals and serve the story or the concept. Beyond that, he decides to take us into a world of shock, Eli Roth-style. Anybody up for a little blood ejaculation? How about a little snip-snip of the old clitoris? Old knife-sharpener wheel through the leg? I will say I didn't think Willem Dafoe could have had it worse than ""Platoon"". I was wrong. In this attempt at shock, which I guess will affect some, he insults the audience thinking he can get a payoff by assuming to reach such brave horrifying cinematic heights and crossing such boundaries by displaying such taboo, shocking, assumptively-creative, shock-gore. I could go further into this but basically, he betrays the audience and questions our intelligence by thinking that we are stupid enough to be as emotionally impacted as we have been with his earlier honest works. I could go on in general. The actors dump more than there heart and soul into this probably hoping to achieve something Bjork or Emily Watson may have reached but were instead betrayed by Von Trier's cop-out. If it is a compliment, I will continue to think about this film for some time. Unfortunately, though, it's clear he doesn't achieve anything here because he doesn't earn it as he has in the past. *1/2 out of 4",Antichrist

It got a little better when things actually started happening 70 minutes into the film, but having to wade through all the slow mo arty scenes was killing me. If it wasn't banned i don't think anyone would have bothered to see it, kinda makes me think that if i made a really crap movie i would put some controversial scene in to try to save it. i wouldn't be surprised if this is the last movie willem dafoe is ever in, shame on him.",Antichrist

Some of the weirdest scenes I've ever seen in film that are just plain stupid - I guess the director is trying to raise the 'shock value' bar.This arty film doesn't inspire, it only leaves unanswered questions for the viewer.

322,gav_walmsley,One of the best films i have ever seen,10,25 April 2011,"What an amazing film this is. It makes me sad to see how people continue to bash this film because I think hardly anyone apart from a minute population of people actually get what the movie was trying to achieve.The film is very melodramatic, especially in the prologue. The film itself starts off with an extremely graphic sex scene that leaves little to the imagination. During this scene, an infant jumps out of a second story window and splatters on the snow below him. This is nothing compared to what follows.The rest of the film takes place in an isolated wood cottage in the middle of a misty forest, where the mother of the child (who is now in a state of depression) is explored psychologically by her psychiatrist husband.The cinematography is bewildering. It is intoxicatingly beautiful, as is the soundtrack.The content on the other hand is quite the opposite. Sexual mutilation like you cannot imagine and gore that levels unbearable kind of dominate the entire film BUT are done for a reason.The entire film is basically an allegory that alludes very strongly to Christianity and following that the relationship between the sexes as represented in the bible and in a modern context. Basically from what i understood from watching the film and from doing research on it, the movie centers around the idea that the man is the Antichrist (the embodiment of death, despair, pain etc) by driving his wife into destruction, who martyrs herself for the cause of saving his own sanity and self purpose. That is just the basics. I had to watch it twice and read up about it further before I got the basics down.The gore and sexual violence relate to Christian abstinence values and the virgin Mary from what I can gather. Basically I looked for clues that alluded to the bible and i think that once one has the gist of what the film is trying to get at then i think that this film will blow you away.The sexual violence grossed me beyond comprehension. It is certainly not for the faint hearted or weak stomached because it is not only extremely graphic, it is also aberrant and weakening. It disturbed the hell out of me. The violence however related to the film's purpose e.g. when Charlotte removes her genitalia with scissors or when she violently engages in intercourse with Willem. Each of these sexual acts represent something different in the film's concept.It is a masterpiece of artistic cinema that needs more attention and praise than what it's received thus far. Dafoe and Gainsburg performed brilliantly and the story flowed wonderfully. The overall presentation I felt was beautiful even though the content itself was hard and uncensored.Overall I loved this film. I think it's an intensely deep film that no-one other than Lars von Trier himself understands and I am still working to try and discover what all this amazing film has to offer.It is disgustingly brutal, and emotionally draining but it's beautiful and artistically drenched. It is totally worth the watch if you're willing to sit through it, and the ending ties the film up brilliantly.I recommend that you watch it because i think that it has a lot to offer the world of film and it totally blew me away. It is without a doubt one of the best films i have ever seen in my life.",Antichrist
323,phani-bezawada,As bad as it gets!,4,27 January 2012,"I've never watched a LVT movie before. I started watching this movie without any prior presumptions or expectations. I disliked it immensely. So much so, that I actually fast forwarded the end sequence where violence begins to mount to dizzying heights. I even found the dedication of this movie to Tarkovsky as an insult the the great Russian director. The premise of the story pretends to be deep. Well, loss of a son may be it is deep. But some how the way it is treated is very shallow. And whatever the director wants to say, about woman and her general lack of spiritual depth etc., he says it in an in-your-face fashion. The only thing I liked about the movie is the opening sequence, with a beautiful Handel composition playing in the background.",Antichrist
324,lnicsmith,An interesting musing on the definitions of good and evil.,4,6 September 2011,"Unnecessary... that's the word which comes to mind when asked to describe this movie. The cinematography is really interesting, particularly in its use of symbolism, and the re-occurring focus on the details of the surroundings in which the movie are set. The creators of this film were unafraid to show the grittiness of nature, accurately portraying the visual effects rather than enhancing them as a more traditional horror film would have. This to me made it seem worse than it would have been in a less realistic portrayal as the viewer's mind had a much harder time distancing itself from the movie and relegating its images to the vault of fiction. I believe that this story would have been better told if it had been made to aim for the Thriller Genre, focusing more on the implications of the characters interpretations of the world and leaving the graphic portrayal of their world views to the mind of the viewer.",Antichrist
325,AbysmalRayne,Very disappointed and disgusted,1,5 January 2013,"I didn't even watch this movie because the opening scene is a full on close up pornography. It shows EVERYTHING as close as possible, literally, of the two main characters having sex. This should not be shown as mainstream entertainment. It should be rated X and advertised as pornographic. I watched the trailer. From watching the trailer it had an excellent plot and could have been an entertaining movie. It has very talented actors and actresses but due to the opening scene unfortunately I was not willing to watch the rest of the movie. I do not condone what they did and I WILL NOT support any film makers that push the lines too far, and this is WAY off the deep end.",Antichrist
326,bettestreep2004,Front runner for Palme D'Or?,6,21 May 2009,"Haven't seen the film yet - but the mixed reviews to date must surely give it front-runner status for the coveted Palme D'Or??? Cannes always pushes the envelope when awarding the top prizes. I recall Pulp Fiction, Fahrehnheit 911 and 4 months, 3 weeks 2 days were also very controversial movies when they won.I have seen the trailer and I dismissed the film as Von Trier delivers an American box office horror flick - but I seem to be very very very wrong.It'll be shown in the US on the festival circuit - but the censored version will be the one that gets mainstream release.Here in Australia - I believe it might be banned. The explicit violence and sex scenes mentioned in other posts remind me of the hoo-hah about films like Pasolinni's Salo, Ken Park and Romance. The former 2 were banned outright here in Australia and Romance I think was heavily censored when it was screened.Out of curiosity - how would AntiChrist compare to films like Salo and Ken Park? I've only seen Salo (overseas - not in Australia) and have seen a heavily censored Ken Park (it's all blurred in some scenes).And will von Trier possibly get an Oscar nomination for Best Director next year???",Antichrist
327,csm_matrix,Antichrist - washing dirty hands with soap of truth,4,24 December 2010,"As I sat to watch ""Antichrist"" I had already been told things like - this film is disgusting; this film should not have been made; useless and evil film, you just feel something evil from the screen... So i decided to get on with it and have my own opinion. Right from the start this movie gets you going. It has great cinematography and precise editing with a very good tempo to it. Sadly, just a few minutes in to the film comes the first spoiler for me. Yes, some things can be shown on film, but there is always a way to direct the film in a way to make the audience feel and understand. Sex is a big discussion around the world and how much should it be shown, but this goes over the top. Bang! From the start you see a detailed shot of penetration. This puts it down for me. But still I've started the film then I should finish it. Till the final quarter the film constantly grows in pressure. It directly works on your psyche. With clever cinematography and well calculated time and space, small things like shivering grass and trees make you feel awkward, they grow on your nerves and emotions. The film grows in symbolism, mixing animals, constellations, creating its own meaning for nature and men. This is where i say that i agree with the word that i got from this movie. I agree that people in their own thoughts and needs, in their own world of understanding are surrounded by death and are heading for the grave. Grief, pain and despair are what people tend to find in life. A life filled with objects that are here today and gone tomorrow. This is where you start using the title as part of the movie. A person in his natural state, being a consumer, egoist, egocentric, is an Antichrist. Without God in a day to day life there is no source of purity, no source of love, joy, importance, meaning, life, no path that doesn't lead to death. Saving is what we all need and that is what we have to find. This is a good overview of what life is like and what it can be. But the graphical content is inadmissible. The easiest thing to accept is a drill bit going through a mans calf. This is surpassed by graphic sexual penetration, masturbation, bloody male ejaculation and a woman cutting her clitoris off with scissors. If I could I would send Lars von Trier to jail for making this film the way it is. Maybe not just him but every one that helped make it.",Antichrist
328,mjk121882,Antichrist,7,5 May 2016,"First, this movie is not for everyone. Some people won't be able to stay engaged long enough to feel the full effect. From the opening scenes, the first thing you will notice is how graphic it is. By far some of the most graphic sexual scenes I've ever seen. The movie moves a little slowly, but the dark tones are never in question. The entire movie just has a dark feel to it. There are no cheap scares or thrills. There is no boogeyman with a big knife chasing the characters, this movie is far too deep and subtle for that. A lot is left for the viewer to surmise. William Dafoe is excellent, and Charlotte Gainsbourg knocks it out of the park. Definitely follows the same type of horror movie that I've seen recently such as The Witch. Great movie if you can handle some of the graphic images.",Antichrist
329,dudespell,If you like psychology...,7,29 September 2009,"If you're interested in psychology you must watch this movie.After a family's tragedy involving sex and maternity (the spoilers ends here) the movie uses allegories and analogies to describe the devastated minds of a couple.Nothing in this movie is real, the sex, the gore, the beautiful photography, everything is shadows from the unconscious, a journey to the minds of a man and a woman.An additional feature in this movie is the scenes without any childish censorship, we see life as we live it, and at the same time a complete absence of pornography.A masterpiece.If you like ""Synecdoche, New York"" you will probably like this one.",Antichrist

There are tons of random scenes that appear out of nowhere which add this mystery vibe. The prologue is great and so is the epilogue. With regard to the theme, it is so devastating and gruesome that it leaves you speechless. I'm going to have nightmares of the clitoris and penis/leg scenes for a long time. Not only that, but the general aura of the movie is eerie and sinister. If you are into that then, go for it. I thought I was but apparently I am not. It is named Antichrist for a reason.

Some sexual bloody scenes, i have seen better in the old Friday the 13th. There was no thrill in the movie, just long scenes with a totally stupid man and a crazy woman.A boring version of Nell meets Misery.I think that people that say this movie is the most disturbing and scary movie at all-time is people that normally only sees black and white French art deco movies about a bag lady's life in Lyon",Antichrist

People are obviously going to be shocked and offended by this but really they aren't getting the point. LVT wants you to be offended by it.It has little themes toward misogyny but its not what the film is essentially about really.Willem Defoe's character ends up killing his mentally ill wife because he cant cure her and he realises that in the end. He is probably mentally ill himself considering he is seeing visions of half dead mutilated animals talking to him.This film is not saying women are evil. Gainsbergs character believes this but she is out of her tree. She blames nature, Satan and menstruation. Her husband is arrogant and not a very good therapist.When it comes to the so called torture porn, its no worse than misery, or the exorcist or hostel. I wanted to look away when she got the scissors out. This is not even the weirdest film I've seen. For that I direct you to crazy surreal Japanese flick Gozu where a woman gives birth to a fully grown yakuza gangster.No this was just a slightly pretentious, well shot, well acted exploration of mental illness and rubbish psychoanalysts.

333,Etceterist,"Remarkable, if genuinely baffling",8,19 November 2011,"She, in her research for her thesis on ""gynocide"" reads old philosophies proclaiming women and witches to be evil by nature. They are controlled by their bodies and have no control of their own their bodies, and as she surmised that human nature is in essence evil, the prosecuted women must have been as evil as the men prosecuting them. She takes this somehow to heart, perhaps having lived a life fearing herself to be less good than she would have wanted to believe, evil even. If all women are evil by their natures, then she must be also, and can have no control over it, and thus bears no responsibility for it. It manifests in small ways- her sexual appetite, (even prior to her son's death) her slow and strange mutilation of her son's feet; all things she can revel in as being of the evil nature native to her. While engaging in the aggressive sexuality she has been playing at, her son dies in an accident. She decides that it was preventable, and that he died because she could not have been bothered to interrupt her pleasure to stop him from falling from the window- suddenly the evil nature she has assigned herself (and all women) has a true consequence for her beyond forcing the wrong shoes onto Nic's feet. It only serves to convince her further that she is evil, and her husband- being the stoic commanding voice of power and reason- decides to ""fix"" her. He is arrogant in his belief that he knows best how to treat her, even that she needs treatment. Having experienced frightening and inexplicable things at their cabin, Eden, the previous summer, She is now ascribing all of her fear and panic and guilt to the woods there. She associates her unconscious decision to free herself of moral responsibility with that place and the nature that defines it, and it becomes an all-encompassing phobia for her. He, being again so self-assured that he knows how to fix this, decides that they must go to Eden to face her fear. I believe Eden here is a literal hell. What they experience when they get to the woods is not mere hallucination but genuine evil that eventually sends them into a shared insanity. She takes on her self-assigned role as the Antichrist, and, having been led to that by Her, he follows in his role as the persecutor. She believes ever more fully that she is evil and must embrace her hedonistic self, and he believes ever more that she is insane, evil by nature, and that he is reason, meant to set her right. Her sexuality becomes more violent and depraved, as she takes less pleasure from it, engaging simply because she believes it to be her bent- almost as though, if her son had to die for her evil, for this aggressive, loveless sexuality, then it must be taken to its full extent to make sense or be for nothing. Each time for her is more painful and more condemning, making her belief more and more irrefutable; she uses sex both as affirmation of her role and as a punishment for the sins she wants to believe she bears no responsibility for. After she mutilates him in an attempt to free herself of his power over her and her own beliefs He tries eventually to escape, but the hell of Eden, Satan's Church, grows more feverish and encroaches more heavily on their sanity. When he is brought back to the cabin, she tries again for catharsis through sex, tries again to both prove to herself that she is free enough of morality through her inherent nature to simply lust freely even in her despair, and also to cleanse herself of her guilt through the masochism she has attached to the act. She ""castrates"" herself in an attempt to exorcise the very instrument that allows her the evil nature that she believes caused the death of her son, and to deny herself any of the pleasure it would afford in the future. At this point, her sense of reason is outweighing her belief in the nature of woman, and the dominant desire is for self-punishment. Eventually though, both fulfill their self-assigned roles, the nature of their belief in the nature of the sexes as wider symbolic entities overcoming their logic or empathy. Eden has fueled their paranoia and obsession, and man kills woman, burning her on the pyre, even though she may not have been guilty of the original sin at hand. (Letting the child die.) The women who close in on him on the hill are the representation of all the victimised over centuries, of the gender as a whole, which is one of the most interesting points I think. People have been saying that this movie simply makes the point that women are guilty of bringing about original sin, of getting man kicked out of Eden, and stands as a thesis to Von Trier's misogyny. I think this scene is what disproves that, and makes the point for the mutually assigned gender roles of persecutor and persecuted, and the self-fulfilling prophecy of their ultimate demise. He is not excused his sins, and the point that these women throughout history have been falsely accused and killed for gender discrimination is not hand-waved. Yes, She is the Antichrist, but only because she assumed the role and because he decided that he was the saviour.",Antichrist

I just saw Antichrist, and it's going to take me awhile to digest it, but I can say already that it might be the most provocative and disturbing film that I've ever seen, and yes, I've seen Pasolini's ""Salo."" The performances from Dafoe and particularly Gainsbourg are heroic, something almost beyond acting. The cinematography is brilliant. People are going to hate this film. There won't be anyone in the middle. The violence is extremely graphic, and I was forced to look away at some points, but it's in service to the story that Von Trier is telling.This film has given me a lot to think about.",Antichrist

If you don't like Gore, extreme violence, or extremely disturbing imagery this movie is one thousand percent not your cup of tea.I'm finding it hard to fault this movie at all really even if I do feel like it went overboard with alot of stuff. At the same time I feel like that was what the director wanted, was for people to come out of the movie feeling disgusted at what they just watched. Loved the acting, loved the jarring but also intriguing camera work, and especially (even though I found myself wanting to gouge my eyes out during the last 20 to 30 minutes) I loved the progression of insanity.If there's one thing I need to say about this movie it's that Lars von Trier made an absolutely miserable experience from beginning to end in the best way possible",Antichrist
337,kmfazil,"Gorgeous, cinematic havoc",10,22 September 2009,"Why do we watch Lars Von Trier's movies? We know for a fact that Lars never compromises for our sake. We know by experience that Lars's films can affect our minds in ways that could leverage psychosis. We even know, while watching his overture-style openings that we might very soon be led down a rabbit-hole of despair and psychotic agony. Why oh why then do we keep coming back to you for more, Lars? Is it because we love the way you taunt us? Or maybe the methodical step-by-step destabilization of our feelings feels sublime when witnessed by us through your lens. Could be so. Or perhaps our sub-conscious mind reaches out to yours through your gorgeous nightmares, your meticulous graffiti that toys with the basic boundaries of our perceptions, walled by our emotions. You first chip away at our instincts. Then you hack away at the emotions beneath them. You expose that vulnerable side of our sensibility; drag it out onto the dirt, beat it into putty and then use it as a palette for your mad, beautiful visions of despair. And Lars, damn you, you enigmatic bastard, you've just done it again. I'm awed.For those new to the artistic vision of this Danish genius, most of the reviews that this movie (or any of Lars' for that matter) is generating could be well. misleading could be an understatement. Lars Von Trier's movies are meant to provoke and taunt you. Subtlety is a sin. Emotions of the most powerfully affecting nature are stripped off all cinematic sentimentality and thrown at you. You simply HAVE to involve yourself with his films. Probably the reason why his movies are best watched in seclusion. You'd either love his movies to the point where it gets so personal that an off hand remark by someone else could leave you completely unhinged, or yes.. turn violent, find a gun (or buy one) and shoot that screen in front of you. Average reviews in this regard could very well be considered impossible, or even stupid.So bare is the essence of Antichrist that Lars Von Trier carries the whole movie solely (and literally) on his modern anti-theological versions of Adam, Eve and Eden. We see them locked in passionate intimacy while their child dies (this, being filmed in a brilliant five minute black & white sequence that redefines cinematography). We also see them do unimaginable and inconceivable things to each other; things that could make us question the very essence of their sanity. Yet in my opinion, I've never seen a screen couple that could emote so much love and so much grief. Charlotte Gainsborough and Williem Dafoe literally carry the movie on themselves and their brilliant body language. I'm at a loss for words to laud these brilliant actors, especially Charlotte.Lars Von Trier usually bases his work around a focal suffering female character. Charlotte is the grieving mother of a dead child who falls to its death at exactly the same moment when she's in the throes of ecstasy with her husband. She firmly attachés herself to the belief that she is somehow responsible for her child's death. Her intense grief turns her despair upon herself. Her therapist-husband convinces her against taking medication, claiming that the doctors just want to keep her drugged. Grief is not a disease, he tells her. He then takes it upon himself to help his wife. Ethical questions are raised here in the form of His monstrous ego. He seeks out her fears through a series of psychic sessions and constructs a fear-pyramid. She reveals to him that she has nightmares about their forest cabin, the reason for which unfolds later. In an act of ""confronting one's fear"" He decides to bring her to the woods and treat her. This is where nature comes in. It takes over both of them and wreaks havoc on both of their fears and perversions.Towards the final chapter of the movie, we see that the cycle of nature is complete in its reprisal of its role as Eden. Instead of Adam and Eve discovering evil, by consuming the fruit of Eden, Eden brings about evil by consuming the fears of him and her. This is where many critics have argued about the misogynistic attitude of the film. It's actually the opposite. The female character simply embraces the evil that she believes women are capable of, seeming to reiterate the prejudices of the material she's been researching.In the epilogue, we see Him consuming berries while a horde of faceless women climb up, towards him. The scene could be interpreted in a dozen ways, depending on the way you look at the film as a whole. For example, why use black and white for the prologue and epilogue? Why does a fox wear a bell? Who are the other women? Are they moving past Him or converging on him? The questions, if posted here could only spoil the movie for those who haven't watched it.Of course, my interpretation of the movie could be wrong. Von Trier himself states in this interview that the work on the script did not follow his usual modus operandi. Scenes were added for no reason. Images were composed free of logic or dramatic thinking. They often came from dreams he was having at the time (of his depression), or dreams he'd had earlier in his life.Lars Von Trier along with his cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle (Slumdog Millionaire) has created a surreal, shocking masterpiece of art. I've said the same thing about Dancer in the Dark, and I'll say it again for Antichrist: It's a profoundly beautiful film. It is unfathomable to me that anything else will wreak such transcendent cinematic havoc for a long time to come. And if there is indeed a wreak, there is no seemingly capable person to do it other that Lars himself.",Antichrist

339,alexanderf,Absolutely astonishing,9,30 October 2009,"Lars von Trier's Antichrist is one of the most magnificent films I have ever seen. I was never a big fan of von Trier, and one of the reasons why were because he always tries to be too original and different, and usually his movies just end up boring and unexciting. In this film, he also tries to be different, but this time he does a perfect job. The prelude of the film, slow-motion black and white action, is one of the most beautiful scenes I have seen in a movie. It just looks great, the music is perfect, and it really sets the tone for the movie. The atmosphere in the film is very special, and even though not much is happening for the most part of the movie, it still managed to keep me excited for the whole time. There are some brutal and disgusting scenes that have made people walk out of the cinema, but for me, it just made the movie more effective and von Trier balanced the brutality perfectly with the movie's atmosphere. Honestly, I love this movie - and I recommend that everyone, even those who call themselves ""weak-hearted"" - see this movie. It leaves you with so many questions, and you think so much about it after wards. It's just amazing!",Antichrist

It was a truly moving experience, to be there, with her, as she evolved and discovered her true nature. I don't presume to have understood the entire movie, because quite frankly, it was pretty complicated, despite the linear action and the simplicity of the plot. Explicit nudity doesn't bother me, even in it's masochistic form, and there were some scenes that utterly made my heart stop. This is not a movie for the faint of heart.

342,ngo-jacki,Provoking...,8,20 May 2009,"Lars Von Trier is a director who's always been going his own ways, and this can definitely be seen in this movie. Antichrist is a movie that doesn't hold anything back when it comes to gore, and the stuff that you see in the film won't leave your mind the next couple of days. But the movie itself is much more than that... The movie is beautifully shot, the story and setting extremely uncomfortable and the acting is fantastic. The movie is sometime painful to watch, not in a ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"" kind of way, but when you leave the theater you feel genuinely uncomfortable, and that is one of the reasons why i liked this movie. It's a movie like nothing i've experienced and I'm glad that we have directors like Lars Von Trier that dares to make a film like this. It's nothing like the mainstream movies that are being made nowadays, and it makes your mind race when you leave the theater, something very few movies does. You aren't served with facts, as with any other movies, but are left to interpret and think for yourself.

343,marmalade-sunrise,"Beautiful, Visceral, Engaging...But",7,8 March 2014,"I am not sure if many people who are terribly shocked by this film just don't watch much horror. Yes, horror movies have disturbing subject matter and graphic scenes. OK? Get a grip. If you don't like horror movies, don't watch this, even if you love other Von Trier films. One obvious problem solved for the people whinging about how grotesque it is. I have seen worse.Try watching Martyrs, or any French New Wave horror, really sheesh. And the sex? Actually quite tasteful. I have seen much more sexually exploitative scenes in hundreds of horror films. IT IS A HORROR FILM. Maybe that should have been made clearer for some folks?That being said, it's beautiful in its cinematography and music, and perhaps for some people it makes the violence that much more jarring, who knows.All good horror films focus on nature, human and otherwise, so it's hardly original in that regard, so I only rate it above average. It's not the best film I have ever seen. In some regards its pseudo intellectual and tries too hard. I really could have done without the final scene, Von Trier actually could have had a better film if he didn't push arty quite so pretentiously, and I say that as a former literature major who watches arty films.Von Trier did not say anything new. Most good horror films play with sex, violence, human nature, nature in general, and question religion or the spirit world. Von Trier just spells it out for you in lengthy psychoanalytic dialogue instead of assuming you're already a smart and serious horror fan and student of life.I enjoyed his exploration up to a point, but I question if his Nietzchean not-so-veiled misogyny (women as chaotic natural evil) was literal, or if he's fully aware of how emotionally unavailable, robotic, cold, distant and condescending the He character was. It was like caricatures, the hysterical woman and emotionally closed off overly logical man.The support for my accusations of misogyny are that Von Trier admits to making films that would irk his dead mother, and his treatment of female cast members such as Bjork and Nicole Kidman, as well as his clear parallels with Nietzsche ...another misogynist people deludedly make feminist apologetics for, despite his clear opinion that women should never be educated and that they are closer to nature or animals than men. Since Nietzsches Der Antichrist is on Von Triers bedside table, and the film clearly mirrors this idea of women being more ""wild"" I just become annoyed with the people trying to force an analysis that conveniently explains away the misogyny of the film because it makes them uncomfortable.And upon furth reflection, I strongly feel that He and She are fallen man and woman in a Satanic ruined garden of Eden...arrogant controlling man and hysterical selfish woman. However, She still bears the burden of sin, like a Biblical Eve or Nietzchean woman (""man is merely evil...woman is mean""). And what of the scores of faceless women at the end? Why are they FACELESS female forms?The fact that I despise a Nietzchean world view certainly doesn't help my rating of this film. It's very good, but not the mind blowing gift some people are saying it is.I think everyone needs to calm down, honestly. I don't feel anything about this film deserves such polarized responses, except for perhaps the squeamish reactions to the torture scenes...however similar displays of violence are found in other contemporary horror.",Antichrist
344,ctp4792,Haunting.,10,4 April 2010,"Lars Von Trier is no stranger to controversy. Often noted as a ""bad boy"" filmmaker, he is responsible for such acclaimed films as Dogville, Dancer in the Dark, and Breaking the Waves. With his latest release, Antichrist, he has truly made something unique and special; something dark, twisted, grotesque, and beautiful. He is constantly pushing the limits of what is acceptable in film-making and with Antichrist, he executes it flawlessly. If I had to choose one word to describe Von Trier's latest artwork, it'd definitely be:Haunting.From the very beginning, Antichrist is a heavy, eerie assault on the senses that doesn't ease its death-grip even after the final credits roll. Every shot is stunning and the score is a perfect partner to its devastating and twisted tale. This is not a film for the casual movie watcher. This takes you into the dark depths of the human psyche and explores the true nature of humanity and fear with visually abusive yet beautiful imagery. When even the land feels evil, you know you've made something powerful.This film feels intensely personal and I imagine Von Trier poured much of his tortured self into this, thus creating its dreary and ominous atmosphere. Von Trier is known for struggling with harsh depression and during the creation of Antichrist, he faced an overwhelming bout of it. While this may not have played into the overall conception of the work, the exploration of depression and his experience with depression can easily be noted as a factor to the feel of the work as a whole.The story follows a grieving couple, He (Willem Defoe) and She (Charlotte Gainsbourg), who are suffering from the loss of their young son. He is a therapist and against his better judgment, decides to treat his mourning wife personally. They decide to retreat to their cabin in the woods, aptly named Eden, hoping that this change of scenery will help to repair their distraught hearts and unstable marriage, but nature has its way with them and their already shaky situation becomes a living hell. Antichrist examines nature in the physical and psychological sense and stares fear and torment in the face and doesn't back down.The story is broken up into chapters that follow the couple through their horrific ordeal, arranged as such:Prologue Chapter One: Grief Chapter Two: Pain (Chaos Reigns) Chapter Three: Despair (Gynocide) Chapter Four: The Three Beggars EpilogueEach chapter is more shocking and unrelenting than the last and keeps you glued to its every turn. They are complied in chronological order for the most part with a few flashbacks here and there and the entire film is beautifully shot and perfectly executes the use of slow motion.I have never seen a film like this and I am having trouble trying to find the words to write for this review. I want to delve deep into its intricacies and examine every little piece of it but that would spoil the experience for those of you who may decide take the trek into this bizarre and chaotic world. It's deeply heavy subject matter and intense presentation rattled me to the core. It has some of the most extreme imagery that I have ever seen on film and in general and I loved every second of this grotesque story.I honestly cannot recommend this film to pretty much anyone. Its subject matter and extreme visual assault can easily offend the vast majority of the population who are unaccustomed to this chaotic style of storytelling. But like the self disemboweling fox said, ""Chaos reigns."" Chaos isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just uncontrollable.Antichrist is pure chaos.More of my reviews here: http://indiescream.wordpress.com/",Antichrist

There is simply no reason to feel anything other than mild disgust and puzzlement as you watch this bleak and largely soulless story drag itself to it's completely pointless conclusion.

I heard people saying this as art film which focuses more on the thoughts of characters, rather than presenting a clear, goal-driven story and makes you to watch again and again to understand the complete essence of whole stuff on which the movie stands. But I must say,most of the people avoid watching it just because of those unnecessary violence which is there in the movie. Personally am fan of Lars Von Trier's movies. I watched his Dogville movie. If this movie was directed by someone else, i would have given full marks to this. But since this movie is the child of Lars Von Trier, I am disappointed with it. It's not an art film.

349,paulosnic,a must see movie with a food-for-thought content,10,13 October 2010,"I'm not going to say much about this movie other than that it is a ""must see"" movie/experience whatever your feelings towards it may be after wards. The artistic visuals, the biblical/Freudian symbolism and the emotions that it arouses, are a rare achievement for a movie. Be forewarned though: you may feel awkward if you see it with friends (or significant others) you don't know well. It's that powerful!However, the reason for this review is not to praise its visual appeal but to comment on the controversy about its content/premise. Ultimately the main concept is ""man/reason vs woman/nature"" in a ""offence/crime/flaws - revenge/crime/flaws - redemption/punishment/demise"" scheme, so of course it would cause controversy. The point however is that all the arguments it offers are circular and ambivalent (both ways). So the movie does not take sides unless you want it to. Thus, it should be best called a ""reflective"" movie which gives plenty of room for discussion and/or self-exploration on the wrong-doings of both sides, and that's why I think it is not only a powerful experience, but also a very useful one for everyone (or every couple) who is open-minded enough to admit and accept the circularity and ambivalence of the arguments.In other words, it's much deeper than an exploitation movie, although because it does provide closure (on the surface), it also gives the freedom to be viewed as such if you decide to... and take whichever side you decide to too!",Antichrist

Some shots are so stunning that I found myself in awe. There was a palpable sense of dread - perhaps almost evil - in the theater; this is a film one feels. One leaves the theater ambivalent: At once disgusted but at the same time amazed. One leaves the film with questions: What was the point of this film? Was there a greater message behind the madness?

And even i don't know what i'm talking about. It is interesting to know though that i started to zone out at some point due to the 'silence' this movie brought but then with every scene and part, it seemed to jolt me into wonder of where the characters are and what their purpose was at the moment.Von trier does a wonderful job of instilling quiet outrage and amazingly allows me to appreciate what is happening.

I know you're thinking I must be a faint-hearted rom-com lover or something but it's not the case. This film is very disturbing, once finished I found myself staring at my bedroom wall for 5 minutes just to put my head back on and feel normal. This is not horror as we know it. It is ""creepy"" and a little too close to home. The acting is fine, the dialogue is great, no plot holes, great cinematography etc, the only complaint I might have is the constant aggressive sex that eventually felt, to me, like they just wanted a lot of sex in the film for no other reason than...sex... but again that might have been done simply to gross you out more.

To sum it up in one sentence: I regret to have seen this film. There are certain scenes that left a terrible memory in my head. Scenes which were just so disgusting and unnecessarily disturbing that have resulted in me not being able to look at Charlotte Gainsbourg in the same way ever again. I have begun to try and block the film out of my memory, which I will hopefully succeed in doing, once I put this review to rest. I believe that the story could have been more effective if told and shown in a more subtle way, but to what end is showing such blatantly disturbing scenes??

It genuinely made me cringe at some parts and adjust my volume due to suspense making me think a creature was going to come out. Plus, it's gorgeous, and well filmed. The idea of using the sexual aspect to induce fear doesn't always work, or if it does it's shock value. This gives you the idea that one of the characters is going insane to the point where they want sex to eliminate their fears and that's the only way they feel love.

The movie puts the woman in a bad spot, she's the crazy one, who tries to kill the man that tries to help her. A lot of gore/splatter scenes that are not necessary, just for the pleasure to shock the audience, or maybe, to keep the audience attention away from a very poor script, often boring. There's also a (not so hidden) final message from the epilogue. Look, you just killed one, there are still millions around you!

To anyone with any humanity, take my word for it - this movie is NOT for you. I don't think that movies necessarily have to be entertaining or uplifting - there is certainly room in this world for free artistic expression. We have to question what kind of society we are becoming, however, if we label simply unpleasant and horrific drivel as art.

365,erling_morkemo,"Antichrist: ""The Mirror"" meets ""Hour of the Wolf""",10,19 September 2009,"Once again Trier is dealing with the strongest emotions between humans; Mother-child relations. And in this case the child dies and the mother struggles with guilt, angst and depression. When Tarkovskij was describing The Mirror (One of Trier's favorite films) he said ""it is about a man who had caused too much pain to the ones whom he loved and who loved him. "" The same thing can be said about all two leading characters (He and She) in this movie. The child tries to escape, with a fatal result.This is an archetype of an art movie – where form and contend matches perfectly together. Trier opens up his inside like a true artist. It is grotesque and sometimes confusing, but that is the way our human psyche is shaped. It has been a trademark for Trier to talk about his angst and depressions. Not everyone in this world has the guts to talk about these difficult issues, and less opens them up in public. But as Bergman says ""a true artist fears nothing ""when it comes to exploring his emotions. And like Bergman's ""Hour of the wolf"" the leading character has a troubled inner life. A lot of the same elements are used in this film like the crow screaming (angst) and the lack of communication between parent and child. Tries has taken the animal thing a step further with Bambi showing up now and then. Bambi and the other animals are twisted, like the mind of her super rational husband. He sees She like a study object and ironically strangles her when He is actually able to help her, for the first time in the film. She has become too uncomfortable for him. Too honest and human and he can't deal with that.As a spectator I recommend not to rationalize this film to much – try to feel it. The only thing that irritates me is the Bambi-nature-symbolism in this film; it makes you believe that you have to ""understand it"". And that is as far away you can come from the Tarkovskij spirit. By the way, this film is dedicated to Tarkovskij and it is packed with scenes from his films.She is a character similar to all the sorrow humans on this planet. When we feel negative emotions we are in her stat of mind. In that way this film tells us; too have negative feelings is part of being human. That is the therapeutic aspect.If you like art films this is a must see!",Antichrist
366,chrisbeer13,art-house for idiots.,3,14 November 2009,"Red flags should be immediately raised when a director (pardon me, a self proclaimed art-house director) creates a manifesto (see dogme95), can't adhere to it, and then disregards it completely. More red flags should be raised when said director goes on record to say that he makes film only for himself, intentionally honking off his audience, and crafting a story without subtext. Typically, I find von Trier to be a very entertaining filmmaker; his movies, though by no means original (at times, such as here, he tries too hard to be Kubrick), are typically very thought provoking (by way of Dogville or Manderlay) or simply intelligently crafted (by way of Dancer in the Dark). When I first heard about Antichrist, I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into it; Mr. Provocateur was going to blister the face of western ideology, taking gender and religion with him. The thought of all this controversy over gender mutilation intrigued the darker parts of my psyche. Surely this was going to be his masterpiece...Or at least these were the hopes of a loyal fan.Antichrist struck me as the type of film made by a kid throwing poop against a wall and seeing what would stick, simply because could.Let's start from the top. Yes, spoiler alert galore.There's a weird bookending to this picture; the prologue and epilogue were too glamorized to be taken seriously, and more closely resembled a perfume commercial than a movie (those who have seen it: did the last shot of the prologue make you think ""it's got to be Tide""? Because that's all I could hear in my head). But these segments do nicely open and close the film, albeit in a head scratching manner. The epilogue also pulls the Return of the Jedi ending with the apparitions, which just about made me pee myself laughing. The meat of the film is style-less, empty, and basically an in-cohesive mess. There's always a fine line in art-house cinema between artistic obscurity verging on subjective textual analysis, and random attempts at avant-garde. I'm sad to say that Antichrist falls on the latter half, mostly due to the inconsistent camera work and visual composition; half the scenes are (sometimes annoyingly vibrating) hand-held 'docu'-style, and the others look like over-produced music video segments. But there is no attempt to create a meaningful collusion, it all just sort of pops in and out. The writing also stifles what could have been an intensely rich film with characters that aren't fleshed out enough to make sense but aren't minimal enough for me to accept the lack of clarification. Now for the 'controversial' scenes...which is really the only reason this movie made it this far. A few seconds of full frontal unmentionables being cut and a penis ejaculating blood, the end. It's shocking, but it's not disturbing; disturbing implies a psychological effect. This is simply for shock value. After all the hype, even the 'should we censor this???' scenes fell flat. Basically, this whole movie fell flat: it didn't pay enough attention to the more fantastic aspects (such as the animal encounters, among which is the infamous 'chaos reigns,' which I found to be the most fascinating elements) to be considered a fable, it didn't pose enough questions to leave it open for contextual debate, it wasn't gratuitous enough to be considered disturbing...in fact, without the genital mutilation, it's just like any other movie.When I think about it, if this didn't have von Trier's name attached, it would have gone straight to DVD and no one would give it any mind. Overall, not a horrible movie, but unfortunately it's just under adequate. I would love to talk to someone who loves this movie, simply to see what warrants such intense thought. My prediction is that the mass public will look upon this movie with awe, for nothing less than the fact that they don't get it, so it must be brilliant. Like I said: art-house for idiots.(Oh, and I try not to read into it this way, but I couldn't help but see how incredibly and viciously misogynistic this movie is.)",Antichrist

372,manupravda,Different techniques - same goal,6,30 July 2010,"I found this film very much in the same spirit as the other films he's made and i have seen – although in a very different genre: each film he makes seems to be an experiment. He likes to see how far he can go and how far people can let themselves transported by the end product. Of course you may not like the gross violence and sexual scenes which sometimes are quite laughable and may not always serve the purported arty and high-brow spirit of the film, but that's the whole point. He is stretching clichés so far that it does move viewers who make sense out of it or at least try to. And looking at all the comments on this page and on different other websites, he seems to have been quite successful in his undertakings. The film is no more a pure intellectual or artistic work but is seen as a medium designed to simultaneously challenge himself and the viewer. The violence, sexual mutilations, and the religious symbols are ingredients which viewers can interpret a lot of different ways and contribute to give you freedom of interpretation and hence more possibilities to get transported by the film which is the intended purpose, even if most of it is crap – this is not important. To me Lars Von Trier is obsessed by how people can be manipulated to adhere to something (through horror, disgust, provocation, love, pity, empathy which he has applied in different films), and he takes risks to try and answer that question. Manipulation is also the central theme between the two characters, viewers are invited to take sides and a lot of tools are at your disposal so you can decide. But personally I can't say I have been very emotionally involved viewing the film, it would perhaps have found more resonance in me if it had stayed a more psychological drama, suggesting that we can all carry the germs of hell perhaps - which the prologue seemed to suggest to me... Of course to finish of I would like to salute the beauty of the images and the outstanding performance of the actors. PS: I am adding this very sentence more than a year after watching the film and the first review I made about it (I am coming back to it as I have just watched Melancholia). Well, I have upgraded my ranking from 6 to 8, because the memories of ""Antichrist"" still bring strong emotions to mind, showing that the film has worked quite well! I remember the day after I watched the film, I was at loss to decide what other film I could watch: it's so strong that it is difficult to match.

373,TotemStack,"Canonical Sermon, Classical Hero Journey, Numeric Elegance and Name of The Beast - Mega Spoiler (watch the movie first!)",10,29 October 2009,"Exquisitely pure canonical cinema and story telling form, the answer to the longing question (where is the Antichrist?) is given to us as the apex. The pledge is formally made (title), and resolved (apex: genital mutilations of both genders). The rest is a refined gem, building up graphic sex and violence to the point where we are ready for a very graphic scene of genitalia being maimed and cut off. The only way to see meaning in all the graphic material (sexual and gore), is to measure it to the essence: pledge/resolution. Do not think of He as a male, and She as a female. As a classical hero, he could be anyone. He will face the Most Evil in a strict canonical way. The Evil witch is his own irrational evil side. They reflect mankind as a whole. He will administer swift Justice for a double crime she commits (male and female genital mutilations), for which she will receive a double death sentence (strangulation and burning). This square numeric resolution structure mirrors the formal numeric pledge from the master story teller:Antichrist: 10 letters. Anti: 4 (square). Christ 6 (two triangles), merging of Male and Female essence, classical Freemason style, and Star of David.Structure: prologue, 4 Chapters, epilogue. The end of the four chapters (square) should be explicit about the Name of the Beast, as it resonates with Anti (4 letters) in Antichrist. there are six parts total (2 triangles).The baby gets his feet mutilated, and mankind looses both its roots (male and female). Begins the hero's journey to find his roots, gain freedom from his darkest demons, his own guilt for abandoning babies to sexual mutilations, to finally reconnect with his spirits, find balance within Earth's gravity, and leave the mountain behind.The resolution involves crimes of most massive proportions in number of victims in reality. The only mutilation done to both genders in the movie: between his and her own sexual mutilation, She bolts his leg to the a sharpening wheel (sword of Justice not working, and points to one of the baby's mutilated feet). These two crimes will earn the evil witch two death penalties.. . .Contextual outside: . Danish origin of film maker. Danish nationals (& Scandinavians) are culturally very opposed to circumcisions and other genital mutilations. In Finland, male and female sexual mutilations are equally prohibited, and to date, the Danish Justice system seem to lean the same way to some degree (timely movie: this is current Danish news). Not make it too obvious to the US and other markets (circumcising cultures) may be a way to sell in circumcising markets. But he makes sure to apply pure form when delivering: no serious analysis could possibly miss the point: sexual mutilations connecting all the dots. . In Charlotte's ""My wife is an actress"", somewhat autobiographical (Charlotte and husband), circumcision (group scene showing only exposed male glans, not a realistic: most men intact), and the circumcision of a baby are an ongoing subplot, concluding as if circumcision was an acceptable compromise to diverging parental cultures! This previous movie allows to suspect Charlotte for having accepted in her real life to have her own boy circumcised, under the cultural pressure of her Jewish husband, and using artistic expression (comedy) to try and sell us this weird idea that it is OK to cut out one's son's sex to resolve cultural parental tensions. Charlotte made some progress to atone for her previous ""sinful"" encouragement: in ""Antichrist"", we have a sexual mutilations movie, associated with The Most Evil. Her character feels guilty all along for having let her boy drop from the window while they were enjoying making love. She abandoned her son, it starts here, only to deliver at the apex some clues on how: Mutilations. Her character mutilated her son's feet, and the apex hinges on sexual mutilations specifically. The movie can be seen among other things, as a stage for Charlotte to express her guilt for having abandoned all the little boys her previous movie has condemned to sexual mutilations.. Lars Von Trier mentions in an interview that he used a mathematical structure to build the movie Antichrist.. . .I particularly appreciate that the Antichrist is presented through feminine witchcraft. From a culture practicing genital mutilations, I know all too well the fundamental role of tribal sisterhoods in demanding male and female genital mutilations. Patriarchal societies do not imply that matriarchal power has vanished; kept unofficial, almost underground, it is here with strong economic implications. Traditional ceremonies are the seat of the feminine power; such are the opportunities for widows to get offered a roof, or sell their cooking skills, for matrons to scheme to arrange the next (forced) marriage, etc... The official power being male generally, men do not have to use occult means in order to impose circumcision. The infamous circumcision kidnappings are a threat coming largely from clan sisterhoods. Finally someone points to the fact sexual mutilations have been historically, and are still today worldwide transmitted through largely feminine occult conspiracies. It's time we get reminded of this crime against humanity as the most evil of evil in the Christian jargon. Antichrist is very specific about what this film maker and many Christian Europeans consider the most profoundly relevant Christian contribution today (replacing circumcisions with water baptism). It shows the most important ""sin"" still unchecked. Unlike other crimes, sexual mutilations can be legislated to near-extinction. No wonder why everyone keeps beating around the bush in comments here (where is the Antichrist in the movie?): isn't the most evil of evil routine practice in some places?Anyone serious about analyzing this movie will see the commanding execution and form, and will appreciate the pure elegance of the pledge/resolution tandem (Name of the Beast - Both Male and Female Genital Mutilations). It will stand out over time.",Antichrist
374,wetcrevice-1,"Brilliant, slow and boring.",5,19 January 2014,"The movie is obviously all about good and evil since that's what most of the conversations are about, and there's plenty of biblical references, and we know that originally Lars Von Trier had intended on making a film about our world being created by Satan, so from that perspective it gets a lot easier to interpret. The male character is Adam and the female Eve. While in Eden, Eve obtains the forbidden fruit of knowledge but is unable to share it with Adam. Several months later she causes her child to die by leaving the gate open as well as the window (despite it being winter) and turning off the baby monitor. She then uses this tragedy to lure Adam back to the garden where she ""shares"" the fruit of knowledge with him by manipulation and cruelty. The film points out that his character is fairly oblivious to what's happening around him and somewhat naive. When she is unable to give him this knowledge or draw out his evil nature she attempts to remove what she see's as the source of it, their sex (just as in the bible where the two suddenly become aware of their nudity) in an attempt to return to a more child like state. When he finally realizes the truth (reality is evil) he murders Eve in an attempt to rid himself of the evil knowledge. But the legion of faceless women who soon approach him on the hill make a statement that there is no end to it, and that you cannot completely rid yourself from the harsh realities of life because there will always be more. The 3 beggars (animals) no longer show hostility towards him because he is aware of his connection to nature/evil and is able to feed off it as we see with him picking berries. Although another possible interpretation is that nature now shines on him not because he has come to accept that he shares a common bond with nature in his being evil with it, but because he has killed his evil wife without becoming corrupted by the act in which case I suppose the horde of faceless women in the end represent a continued attempt by Satan to draw him into violence and temptation. The women aren't shown making any hostile movements towards him but it's obviously meant to be ominous and frightening at the least. We never see him either run or lash out at the horde as the film ends just before they come into contact with him, so this leaves us questioning what happens next, perhaps to imply that it is a choice we can still make. There are plenty of videos on youtube featuring the cast and crew explaining the movie, but I didn't bother to watch any of them because I thought the movie was a bore. It was very clever and made you look deep in order to understand it, but it was still kind of clichéd in it's imagery, deep ominous tones and overly unnecessarily long scenes that directors seem to love to utilize so they seem more artistic and emotional. It's something you'd expect from a college film student who wants to be taken seriously. Hold your silent shots for as long as possible and have the characters talk in gentle whispers. Also include lots of shots of people staring contemplatively, wash out most of the colors and have some scenes in black and white. Still it's smarter than your average movie and the actors give everything they have. Just don't expect some epic Stanley Kubrick or David Lynch type adventure into horror. It's a small weird art-house film that uses over the top imagery to make it's point, even though the point alone was interesting enough to begin with.",Antichrist
375,sh-buccleugh,"""Antichrist"" as Feminist Cinema",10,23 November 2010,"First, let me apologize to any of the previous reviewers here who may already have raised the following notions. I just don't have the time to read them all.I took with me into this film my prior experience with ""Dogville"" and ""Breaking the Waves."" I was largely ignorant of the misogynistic details which critics and viewers have elaborated in these reviews and elsewhere.Yes, the word misogyny was in my (Male) mind as I began to watch, but I believe that I experienced the film mostly on its own terms; rather than watching for all the details to serve as the newest examples of Von Trier's denigration of his female characters, I was immediately immersed into the film's beautiful opening sequence which carried me all the way to the last shot. I don't believe such immersion into the work is possible for viewers whose agendas are already blocking them as the film begins.Think for a moment about the philosophical school of Deconstruction. I immediately admit to my grossly over-simplified rendering of this style of critique, but I will ask you to think about the tenet that every Text already contains within itself elements that take apart, or at least challenge, the work's (the author's) evident ""intent."" So how can it be that a film written and directed by a loud and very proudly misogynistic director could carry a feminist counter-flow? Yes, we do see a brief replay of the slow motion opening as she turns her head to the right, eyes open, apparently seeing their son free of his crib and climbing. But this comes much later in the film. And, a reexamination of the opening sequence in its entirety shows no such glance; her eyes are closed and her mouth is open in explosive passion. She never turns her head to the right. The only warning we can see is the digital sign of an audible alarm from the child's room, which both He and She might have, but didn't, hear. So where, or from whom, does this sequence come? I suggest much of the violence and bizarre behavior in the film is her response to total, smothering control. Throughout we hear him talk at her, appropriating her grief. He cannot resist constantly guiding her through his discourse, unprofessionally ""treating"" his own wife, and criticizing the inexperience and intelligence of her physician. ""He gives you too much medicine,"" he tells her; ""your grief is not atypical."" He is the one who must guide her, directing her hypnotic progress through the woods to the cabin. He takes her down the path to desensitize her fear but notice how she is almost unseen, obscured by the dreamy haze and swallowed up by nature gone riot. The point of view is outside of her, and we cannot be sure from whose mind these sequences are coming.It is clear that something terrible has happened there before, and she is terrified of going there to heal. What that terror was we don't know, but it is not a healing place. He reduces her grief process to his sketched pyramid to map her progress, containing her emotion within strictly drawn boundary lines.So controlled and confined, the pressure builds beyond her breaking point and unleashes all the violence and explicit mutilations in the latter part of the film There is a claustrophobic feeling throughout the film, by which I mean this viewer feels trapped with her by Him as she strikes out blindly to attempt to shred her entrapment; she commits violent and illogical acts driven hysterical by her need for emotional and cognitive space. She says with quiet sarcasm ""but you are not a doctor... you are so much smarter (than her doctor)...""; and, from the moment she tells him her thesis and he calls it ""glib,"" she replies that she too then thought it glib. ""Women don't control their own bodies""; their thoughts and feelings too are mapped out for them so that they make sense to masculine logical thinking.The actual film elements, particularly the cinematography, should be explored in much more detail, but hopefully by a dispassionate critic who will not replicate His control impulse by applying already fixed notions about the work of Von Trier and his earlier films.",Antichrist
376,karl-dammer,"A dark, slow, visually beautiful and mentally powerful masterpiece",9,7 September 2009,"First let me address the comment on people who rated this film ""enjoying torture movies""....for an American person to claim this is because they are danish, well, id take a look at the likes of Hostel, Hostel 2, The Hills Have Eyes and a million more. Those are exploitation torture films and its an insult to even suggest this is in the same class. This film a story, a deep, pained and intricately woven tale of suffering, loss, and the nature of life itself. There's actually very little violence in the film, but believe me what little there is, is direct, shocking and deeply disturbing on every level. The director tackles the subject with consummate ease, taking the viewer on a journey of suffering, guilt, grief, ego and finally the nature of all things. At the start you might dream for a moment you know where its going, but believe me when I say you don't. I cant say you will ""enjoy"" this film, its a film thats hard to say you enjoyed, but it will grip you, fascinate you and leave you thinking. The plot itself is interspersed with some gritty visual work which makes even the most innocent sight, spin 360 and take on a whole new meaning. You will not look at nature the same afterward. Some of the lines are leading, revealing and testing to the intellect and the more you consider some of the things said, the most it pulls you into its woeful spiral of despair. When the violence comes, its start, graphic and mentally numbing, and believe me the director doesn't hold back and wont spare your feelings. But even the most gruesome moment, carries a cold, poignant significance in the underlying meaning and the battle of your mind to consider and your will to look away is genuinely a blend you will remember. I wont tell you the scene or spoil it in anyway, but there's a scene thats cruel to the eye and yet its underlying meaning is terribly powerful. There's so many ways to read it, interpret it, pull at the edges of the concept and watch it spiral out of control in your mind, and all the time you just want to squeeze your eyes shut. Even though its hard, you will not want to turn it off. It cries out for you to see it through and when you do, it leaves you drained, glad you did, wishing you hadn't, mentally fatigued and emotionally challenged all at the same time. Its art of a whole new kind, the hardest kind. Maybe the truest kind.",Antichrist
377,adeebkasem,Chaos reigns,10,9 March 2011,"Lars Von Trier took the horror genre as his inspiration; as an excuse to make the most disturbing film in the history of cinema.

He tells her to conquer her fears by facing them. The film begins being about fear, and as it progresses it causes fear.Antichrist is not a horror movie. It is an art film masquerading as a horror movie. There are no predictable plots, screen monsters, or glorified violence. Instead, Trier's script delivers an intelligent character driven story which finds its horror not in any superficialities, but in the most terrifying aspect of nature: human nature. Anthony Don Mantle's breath-taking cinematography presents a stark contrast to disturbing surreal imagery and graphic, unflinching, brutally realistic violence.William Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg deliver the most important performances of their career as the unnamed couple. Their characters have immense psychological depth and are portrayed so naturally that you share their grief, pain, and despair.Although the score begins as operatic, for most of the film it is sparse and atmospheric. The score displays the mood of scenes more than the events.Overall, Antichrist is masterfully crafted by Lars Von Trier. It is made to shock both one's senses and mind.",Antichrist
378,sakesu,For the love of all that is good left in the world do not see this film,1,26 May 2010,"I have to write this but I don't want to because I would desperately like to block out the images I saw in this film. I have seen some pretty terrible films in my day but as I explained to a friend after watching Antichrist, I could take every terrible film I have seen previously in my life, put them all together in a continual loop of unmitigated misery that I would be forced to watch while slowly having my skin flailed off painfully and by centimeters with a spoon, then to have my raw exposed nerves coated with honey and rolled into a giant African Red Ant hill and it would STILL not even come close to how terrible this film actually was.There are some things you should never see. You should never see Charlotte Gainsbourg in a film, let alone, naked, let alone, forcefully masturbating herself, let alone having sex with Willem Dafoe and a number of other horrific things which included her pathetic acting and screaming in the woods with a piercing repetitive sound that would make local dogs bark and whine for release.You should never see Willem Dafoe having torture-porn sex with Charlotte Gainsbourg (or anyone, thanks for the searing image that will not ever leave my brain of your white clenching buttocks thrusting) or acting (is that what this pitiful thing they did on screen is called) according to the direction of Lars Von Trier, a fake auteur if there ever was one who is apparently not only a misogynist but completely and totally insane and should be locked up because what he has done here certainly can be considered a crime against humanity and without a doubt is extreme brutality to women.If you want the details of the film please read other reviews here or actually spare yourself the details entirely and just make the best decision possible and do not lose your precious innocence by watching Antichrist. If only I read the reviews here first.It doesn't get to the real horror until near the end of the film and I will tell you that I have never in my life wanted to hurl and burst into tears at the same time while watching a film.Some reviewers and fans of Charlotte Gainsbourg have actually called her an earthy beauty and I don't know what kind of mind-altering substances these people are on but she is one of the sinfully ugliest women I have ever seen and that she has been allowed to make films and been paid for it is some kind of outer limits, beyond the beyond lunacy that I cannot cope with nor can I that she actually received the best actress award for this performance at Cannes last year.For a long time the media has forced actresses upon us and told us they were beautiful when they are in fact anything but. Yet Charlotte Gainsbourg is actually uncomfortable to look at, unsettling to watch move, speaks as if she is holding a glass of water and marbles in her mouth in a dull thick monotone and can only be described as the anti-erection. No make-up, lank, stringy hair, skin and bones body, no shoulders, being forced to watch her in a pleasant film would be a kind of torture of its own. But in this film? I cannot even guess or fathom what would have made her agree to be in this film except perhaps her evening rampages through villages where she tortures babies by making them look into her lifeless eyes was on the wane.The world has become a dark and evil place (or it has always been so, only there were at least a few pleasantries here and there) is all I can surmise from this and to know that Charlotte Gainsbourg took part in this film as a married MOTHER of two only terrifies me more and makes me consider that this actress may be the embodiment of pure anti-feminist evil.I also take great umbrage at the weaving in (with absolutely no knowledge or background whatsoever) of a ridiculous sub-plot involving women and witchcraft. No one involved here obviously did any research and used this as a device to not only insult every woman currently living on the planet but every woman who has passed on as well.This is a film about hate. A film about hating sex, toddlers, snow, mothers, fathers, animals, trees, bugs, ferns, clouds, flowers, penises, vagina's, erections, masturbation, and hating women so deeply that the filmmaker allows the most graphic and horrible depiction of female genital mutilation ever filmed. You know there are serial killers in prison who could view this film and think, wow, that's harsh, I just filleted and ate my victims.Of course it is purely calculated on Lars part, and I'm sure he has laughed himself silly watching people remark at the films beauty and significance. What a power trip for Lars – look at what I can do – waste 11 million dollars on making the most revolting thing ever put on film and people will tell me I'm brilliant and give my lead actress an award and then others will give me more money to torture other actresses on screen for their amusement. How delightful.Ten years ago this film would have never been made. Twenty years ago it would have never even been conceived.

It's such a cheap trick! How can people say that the prologue is wonderful/brilliant etc, when it's a mere legerdemain of the lowest kind? I mean, get together a cute baby, a washing machine and a couple having explicit sex, and you have not a brilliant scene, but a brainless, comfortable attempt at stirring emotion. Bah.In fact, the entire movie suffers from a lack of creativity: the ominous atmosphere is suggested by heavy fog (I mean fog machines), a fox speaks (everybody burst out laughing, no wonder!), a crow refuses to die despite being hit over the head repeatedly. How much must we suffer for von Trier's shortage of original artistic vision! As for the rest, a friend explained it had to do with seeing women as intrinsically threatening because of their sexual drive. I recommend Odishon for that - more intelligent, less cheap.",Antichrist

It is played out almost like a bad impression of Dante's inferno.There is no discernible plot, and long periods where its simply silent with a dark filter used to attempt a sad look. Half the movie is of grief and sex with tears, the rest holds no real interest. When you think ""Anti-Christ"" you think of demons, devils, angels, mystic war or at least something related. The only plot happens about 20 mins to the end and there is no true foreshadowing to indicate of it.Basically, If you like a movie without music, action, drama, suspense, horror, and or thrills, but rather some persons look into a demented human Psyche with afterthoughts of regret.

I expected either something thought-provoking or, as a consolation prize, at least some genuinely erotic sex scenes. No luck on either count. The only redeeming features of this movie are the nature cinematography (which is fine but not that extraordinary) and the fact that the female lead looks like a prettier Patti Smith. The first half, setting up the situation, is also well-acted if rather pretentious (and it is sad to see these performances wasted on this plot). But then the movie gets started and turns out to be a tedious hide-from-the-madman slasher film with no other point whatsoever (unless misogyny is a point). That anyone could take this film seriously is a sad commentary on, well, them.",Antichrist
383,sandimh1-573-20805,"Misogynist and yes ""art"" can cross to irresponsible",2,6 November 2009,"I actually found this movie to be at least intellectually provoking, albeit depressing and partially enraging. I read it as a misogynist film exploring the freudian id. Spoilers - Woman thinks that she is afraid of the chaos of nature, realizes that she is afraid of nature more specifically because she thinks that human nature can be evil and then realizes that no she is really afraid of discovering that She, woman, is evil and so distracts herself with sex, masturbation, etc. (where the Id comes in - so to that credit I don't think the basic porn was All for the shock value. She pretty much jumps her husband's bones whenever she's most upset) to avoid the pain of this realization. ""He"" makes a pyramid representing her fears to dig into what she is really afraid of and after nature and Satan he writes ""me"" at the very top. What basically reveals itself is that she thinks that what scares her most about violence towards women is that they deserve it and human nature has made men act violently towards women throughout history for a reason. Obviously the fact that they are in Eden is representative as well - Evil stems from ""Eve"" who succumbed to the devil by taking the apple. Of course I've heard many interpretations of the Adam and Eve story and this movie opens my mind to a new possibility of interpretation (interpretation, not truth, I'm pretty sure us women aren't the devil and believe biblical stories to be allegorical and largely butchered by power hungry men - look into the Essenes and their scriptures/gospels if you are one of those who is bothered by this sentiment. Also might be helpful if you would like another take on the feminine in Western religion). Since the tree bearing the apple was the tree of knowledge and the snake has been associated with matriarchal goddess cultures you could argue that Eve Was the devil in this story and merely discovered so after eating the fruit of knowing - there's your AntiChrist. The poor logical men in the film try desperately to get away from her and her insanity and she cripples them to keep them from leaving - the boy's shoes and the weight on her husband's leg. Luckily the boy has enough ""sense"" to realize that life isn't worth living due to it's pain, grief and despair and pushes these things away in the form of tin figures before peacefully falling to his death in escape. This pessimistic thought process to some is brutally honest but I really don't get how it is any more so than to thinking that recognizing evil within us and the world is merely opportunity for change and not escape (she of course also unleashes her evil after discovering it and becomes increasingly violent until she is murdered). Yes, change is a lot of work sometimes but people up to the challenge and annoyed by people who aren't (or concerned for them and the power of their influence) and wallow in pessimism are just close minded? Like us Americans right? Sorry, I've just read and heard far too many snips at us (and actually most, for some reason, coming from people within the States themselves). I watched this movie with fellow Americans and women, and we all ""got it"" - another snip, us Americans are incapable of understanding ""art"" - before it was finished (and our interpretation could be flawed but we all interpreted it to be exactly the same thing). We weren't shocked so much by the images - I knew to look out for them - as the misogynist content (those arguing this - why are the women the only faceless characters?), having read rave reviews beforehand. Portraying women as evil (including Mother Nature, bringing us to this ""hell"") and life as not worth living is beautiful to some people? Lars von Trier has even admitted, I found out after viewing, to being depressed while making this movie -woman troubles? - and so I think that the content is a bit more bratty then fans of it would like to admit that it is. Yes, it is aesthetically pleasing at times and at least somewhat interesting, but this is what it takes to bring people to a place where they feel as if they just saw a cinematic masterpiece that evoked real emotions these days...? I guess this is more entertaining and prettier to look at then watching animals eating each other on the Discovery Channel however, or your typical horror movie, but ""brilliant"" it is not. Those of us who prefer more complex (and yes preferably at least somewhat optimistic or intellectually stimulating but bringing to a realization that is a bit more legitimately insightful or a true art conglomeration without agenda that plays like music and not doldrums) plots and actual character development in movies are just puritanical though I guess. Delicate minds don't belong to people who try to be optimistic so much as they do sickos who could see this movie at an impressionable time and really be deluded by it. Psychopaths with mommy issues going on killing sprees of women is a common enough occurrence throughout history but hey let's potentially plant that seed in other sick minds too. I hope Lars von Trier has come out of whatever he was going through. Where are the esteemed directors making moving art who have been enlightened to a point of stepping outside of a ""poor me"" power complex? Maybe he can rise to the challenge (again? I have to admit I haven't seen his other films) in a future film, there's hope for all of us yet. Keep the primal themes sure, I agree that we need the primal sometimes but the irresponsible self promoting personal therapy (here's the reservoir of all of my darkest thoughts everybody You - International movie goers - take them off my hands for me, I'm bloodletting) not so much.",Antichrist
384,a0121536,Hollow,5,11 June 2010,"In my opinion, this movie is overrated. And not only that - the attention it's got is way too much. It just impresses me with nothing. It does not shock me. It does not carry such a mysterious heavy mood. It is not even glued together right in my view. The metaphors are cheap and obvious. Not put in the right places. The movie has an abrupt flow. I imagine good art having many levels and being fascinating and continuous on all of them. These 'metaphors' were displaced and just thrown in from time to time. The gore shots and the nudity were coming out of nowhere - at random the camera decided to look at things or to skip them. The shaky camera work is nothing new as well. The story had several Hollywood-style twists that were absolutely cheap. And the major ideas appeared for no reason. I was looking for some sort of opinion or an interpretation of the presented problems, but... no. They just stood there as we all know them and the characters had to cope with them.It just makes me wonder. There are way more disturbing movies. There are way more provocative and imaginative movies. There are way more absorbing movies out there. My theory is that people just feel the need to go with any flow and join some camp. For me, this movie was hollow and misbalanced. For abstraction to take over, there needs to be less story. For mood to take over, there shouldn't be interruptions. For shock to take over, it should not come out of nowhere, but be opposed to something natural that's going on.",Antichrist
385,rapace33,Nature (The Eternal) facing the Antichrist,3,10 November 2009,"There is really not a scene that's not emotional, says Gainsbourg, who shot the movie after recovering from surgery to treat a brain hemorrhage caused by a water skiing accident. For me, it was really exhilarating, all the suffering and tears and screaming. There was a pleasure in it. I don't know if it's masochistic - it might be - but it's so uncommon to be able to go that far and to express yourself that way. It paid off: She nabbed the best actress award at the Cannes International Film Festival. To me, the viewer the movie 'Antichrist' is no other then an awful script of a Dante's like journey. It is the confrontation between Nature (The Eternal) through Willem Dafoe character versus the Antichrist (Satan) played by Charlotte Gainsbourg. The Antichrist is a 2009 horror film written and directed by Lars Von Trier Since premiering at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, where Gainsbourg won the festival's award for Best Actress. One of the festival's most-talked about incidents involved Von Trier and a reporter from the Daily Mail who asked the director at a press conference to 'explain and justify' his film. The film-maker responded by asserting he was the best director in the world and bigger than God. I congratulate Charlotte Gainsbourg for your 2009 Cannes's Golden Palm. But I am disappointed of her choice for the Antichrist film though that allowed her to receive The Golden Palm at the Cannes festival of 2009. I am a French citizen, my grandfather immigrated from Russia, I live in the USA, and I can tell you that the film of Lars Von Trier which he has dedicated to Tarkovsky, who himself if it had he had seen the movie, would turn over in his grave, in fact Tarkovsky is turning over in his grave.",Antichrist
386,bpm_255,Grotesque but with purpose,8,3 May 2010,"This movie is violent and very sexually graphic, bordering at times on artistic but hardcore pornography; but it isn't lurid for the sole purpose of scandal. ""Gory"" appropriately describes some sections of this film but the word by no means encapsulates it.If one is willing to stomach the periodic revulsion of watching this movie from beginning to end with a thoughtful and mature perspective they will find that it is full of symbolism, foreshadowing, and the kind of characterization that brings great success to novels. Few movies, in fact, possess the level of depth that Antichrist does. The movie isn't packed with moral insight but that doesn't preclude it from being intellectually engaging and, as a consequence, genuinely entertaining. One will also realize that the violent and sexual content is never pure excess. The gory scenes, though sickening, are always important in some way to the main themes of the movie.At several points during the course of this film I couldn't help but rewind it to watch a scene again, discuss it in greater depth with my friends, attempt to extricate the finer details that are present in abundance both at the surface and underneath.To anybody that tries to berate this movie as the deranged product of excessively liberal foreigners I must point you to movies like Saw, which drew American crowds young and old for numerous sequels that were basically just series' of elaborate and gruesome torture scenes, sometimes clever but never much more than that.There is more to Antichrist than meets the eye, and I highly recommend it to anybody looking for a horror/suspense film that engages more than just the reptilian parts of the brain.",Antichrist
387,dougshields1,Not your normal scary satanic horror film!,7,2 December 2010,"I watched this on Netflix thinking that it would be a decent horror film. Dafoe is one of my favorite actors. What I got instead was a film that both fascinated and horrified. Most striking were the intensely graphic and violent sex scenes that one would expect in an x-rated movie instead of something you'd download from Netflix. Before you reject the movie as being pornographic know that this film treats these scenes as art rather than mere sexual gratification. That being stated I have to say this was indeed a thought provoking and riveting movie. The cinematography was breathtaking and the acting of both Dafoe and Gainsbourg was some of the best I've seen in a long time. The archetypal imagery was so plentiful that I'll be checking references for weeks after watching it. This isn't a particularly scary movie although a growing sense of dread continues throughout as it progresses to the epilogue. The music, the images, and the storyline will haunt me. This was not an easy film to watch. It was difficult to experience for so many reasons. The basic premise is the extremely violent feminine nature of Gainsbourg's character and how it reacts to the typical male nature dominant in our society and reflected by Dafoe's rational and analytic reaction to what is happening. Dafoe's character, a psychiatrist, attempts to ""fix"" his wife's grief by pushing her through the things that she fears. Toward the end of the movie it becomes obvious that Gainsbourg's character has returned to her roots as a pagan or wiccan and is reacting to Dafoe's attempts to ""cure"" her of her malady in more twisted and violent ways. Not for kids or for those sensitive to strong sexual content. I give it 7 out of 10 stars.",Antichrist

I found the first half of the film quite slow, the second half improved but mainly because it was so beautiful visually, rather than anything else. It has some great scenes to look at, and on a positive note i like the movie because it's something different and quite weird, it is left open to interpretation at the end.

Her husband abruptly took her off the meds that her doctor was giving her and if you know anything about ADs and the anti-anxiety meds, you would know that abrupt cessation can cause delusion, hallucination, hear, panic, paranoia, depression, suicidal ideation, anger, just about every emotional reaction under the sun.

His Antichrist is at once poetic and incredibly banal; and, in some instances, it's infuriating. The opening scene -- with its pairing of operatic melodies and unnecessarily graphic sex, and photographed in pristine black and white -- is signature von Trier, as it's rather aimless and completely indulgent, but at long last it doesn't exemplify von Trier's apparent goal for the film, which, as I saw it, was to make its characters' suffering a palpable, fully-relatable thing for the viewing audience. And in that regard, Antichrist hit its stride perfectly. But I will never watch it again.",Antichrist

I would give a list of several great films it's like but that would be quite cliché and several elements to this film are extremely unique.I can understand this film is not for the faint hearted and is getting (some) criticism from parts of the media/critics/reviewers, etc but I don't really know why those sorts of people would be watching something they know will be 'controversial', horrific and explicit and commenting negatively about it.This is a truly truly brilliant film on so many levels. Some scenes in this film with leave you with nightmares and in some cases it will not even be the scenes just the atmosphere and direction of the film as a whole.

From there it was brought back to human morals and behavior when in fact it was mammals breeding. For all the attention paid to details (petechial hemorrhaging) and then we have a talking fox irritated me.

395,scottytheinsane,Leaves a Lingering Malaise...,10,14 September 2012,"I literally just saw Antichrist for the first time. It will likely also be the only time I ever set eyes upon this film. Now let's not get ahead of ourselves and use that as a justification against watching it for yourself. If you want some of those, I'll gladly list them for you, but that will be in a section to follow. No matter what you read about Antichrist, you simply are not going to be prepared for it. This isn't the kind of horror that you're used to with today's mainstream media. You won't find stuff of this caliber in most film festivals. But enough about what this film isn't...You may have noted that my summary on this movie mentioned a lingering malaise. It's quite intentional that I used such phrasing. Right from the start of the prologue, Antichrist takes you out of the normal movie-watching mood and puts your mind right where it wants it. The cinematic quality is stunning. The images are captivating. The notion of what happens is the kind of horror that you can relate to... in the sense that you will seriously never want to be in the shoes of those involved. And don't think for a moment that the sexual content of these opening moments is there merely for shock value. No, it brings your mind right to the level of susceptibility that it needs. A part of your mind will get excited - it's instinctual - but that very same part of your mind will soon learn that there are times when it should keep to itself rather than opening itself up for the brutality of the assaults it will feel in the forthcoming chapters. Grief, Pain and Despair will each take you deeper and deeper into a world where the lines of ""social acceptability"" become crossed, and the idea that there are some things left sacred becomes little more than a joke. As many other reviewers have gone into detail about the mutilations (both self-inflicted and otherwise), I will simply say that it isn't merely their presence in the film that shakes your mind. It's the constant toying with your base-instinctual side, which it beckons to come to the fore only to ""reward"" it with imagery that would take an entire bottle of Viagra and an expert Call-Girl to make it forget enough to even think about letting you ""rise to the occasion"" again any time soon.The film is in a league of its own. The artistic style is a bit insistent on itself, but not to the point that it takes away from the messages of the film. And I personally feel that you will end up taking from this movie something different than any other viewer did. Unlike some who seem to believe that it attempts to force-feed you some ideals or concepts, I believe that it lets you draw your own conclusions and entices you to think long and hard about what it presents before you have an idea about what it was that you watched. Final Words: It's a must see! That is of course assuming you don't have a weak stomach, have no intention of getting ""lucky"" in the next few days, and you are a glutton for punishment as well as a thoughtful viewer.",Antichrist

I can honestly tell you that watching this movie is a mistake.

397,kittyporn0,Worst film I've ever endured,1,23 April 2012,"Beautiful cinematography, and I don't have a problem with explicit sex if it serves a purpose but quite frankly I found this film to be ridiculous with no redeeming value. In fact, it represents ~2 hours of my life I will never get back. Where do I begin? I watched the film on DVD so I had the benefit of extra features. I watched them all including the director commentary because I was sure I'd missed something. However, it did not reveal WTF the point of events like - the only ""oddity"" that the autopsy reveals is that Nic has a deformity of his feet. But so what? We find Nic was being forced to wear his shoes on the wrong feet - did that cause his fall? Did that constitute senseless torture by his mother because she was an ""evil woman?"" Who knows, the commentary revealed nothing. Nor did it reveal the symbolism behind the masses of women descending the mountain at the ending. I imagine they were the corpses of all the ""evil"" women?"" How did all these evil corpses get there? What was the significance of Eden? How did it become the epicenter and burial ground of evil women??? What about all the sex scenes? The finale suggests that her thesis was disproved by Eden where the forces of nature revealed that women are the truly evil, manipulative, and conniving of the sexes. So, why the constant violent insistence that her husband puck her, at every inopportune moment, when he is trying to help her, she is constantly grabbing at his zipper, his dick, its all rather desperate and nonsensical... The scenes went from evocative to boring. I'm bored, where is this plot going? What plot? I'm not impressed - although Defoe's pubic hair is rather impressive (but I digress). After all that, she mutilates herself? Why? Is her cli-toris the source of evil and by mutilating herself she is being set free? We will never know because she immediately gets strangled and burned Salem-Witch-style. Oh, and I almost forgot the most hokey element - the three beggars - Bahaha! The fox, the doe and the crow. She says when they appear someone must die, they appear - she dies. The end, right? NO! They again appear to Hubby as he is limping out of Eden. It is absolutely comical. Then all the dead ladies in skirts start descending the mountain... seriously, its as ridiculous as it sounds.",Antichrist

399,jeffery-christensen,My views as a Psychologist (Spoilers Abound),6,31 May 2014,"I heard a lot of things about this movie from friends and read some reviews online before watching this movie, but after watching it, as a Psychologist, I had some different personal observations about this movie.1. When the baby died while they were having sex, the mother took sole responsibility. The father only took partial responsibility, and it seemed to me as though the only reason he took any of the blame at all was to gain the mother's trust.2. The wife stated ""You only took an interest in me when I became interesting"". That rings true in the movie; he seems to suddenly be interested in talking to the wife as a ""therapist"".3. The arrival of the idea to go to Eden was kind of ambiguous; he even says ""if you can't tell me what your fear is, let's find the where"". Either the husband knew they needed to end up there (consciously or not), or that question makes no sense. Yes, she had been to Eden with the child, and even though it should have been a ""happy place"" for her, the husband stated that he didn't know that.4. The husband keeps saying how he shouldn't have sex with a patient.... What? Now only if he believed that to be true, he wouldn't have taken her out of the hospital or KEPT HAVING SEX WITH HER. Besides, who keeps talking to their spouse as a client unless you're a complete jerk?5. From the time they get to the cabin, SO MANY clues that he is actually evil: the ticks on his hand, the eagle that eats it's baby (like he didn't see that coming), the trees dying because of his presence, and so on.6. Her triangle of fear: either he honestly didn't realize that she was afraid of him (top of the pyramid), or he was possessed to have no outward realization of truth.7. It's hinted on that their child was the Christ reborn, but only vaguely. It's also only vaguely hinted on that the Husband is, by actions, the ""Anti Christ."" I'm pretty sure they only mean those in the most loose of terms, as in the child would have ""saved them"" but their actions caused them ""not to be saved"".8. Based on all of the above, they take on their spiritual roles hypothetically (and only as seen by the characters):Mother of the Savior, Holy Child, and Anti Christ.Just My Thoughts.",Antichrist
400,creditsrlives,Certainly an Experience,6,30 December 2012,"Whoa, holy God.I'd heard things about Lars von Trier's Antichrist since its first screening at Cannes in 2009. I had heard about how graphic it was, how disturbing, how downright disgusting it was at times. A few people had said, ""You HAVE to see this film,"" and a whole lot more said ""... Lars.""There is always something to be said about a film that can sustain itself with a cast of two (arguably 2.5). The entire film is portrayed by Willem Dafoe (always a treat) and Charlotte Gainsbourg, and both performances are solid. I guess they'd have to be, though, or this would not be much of a film. Which it is.First and foremost, I want to say that I truly believe this is a well-made film. I think the camera work is intriguing, the cinematography is quite stunning (there are some moments of truly jaw- dropping beauty) and the story itself is interesting enough, propelled by the (no doubt sick) mind of Director / Writer von Trier. However, and maybe (likely, even) this is me, but I just didn't quite get it.Take a couple. They have a kid. The kid dies. The couple is sad. Mommy goes a bit mental. Makes sense, right? Well, yeah. Daddy is a therapist, and tries to help mommy, and they go to the scary cabin, or ""Eden,"" as they call it, and mommy is scared of grass, and daddy is scared of acorns, yadda-yadda-yadda, whatever. It makes sense.But then there's the gratuitous violence.And, before I continue, let me impress upon you that I can handle gratuity. I love gratuity. I am the king of gratuity. I AM gratuity. But... Well, let me put it this way:When the couple were walking along and stumbled upon the deer with the miscarriage hanging out of its rear, I was like, ""Hot."" When we were treated to the image of the two characters freely thrusting into one another, naked, upon a tree littered with twisted arms and legs, I was like ""Go on."" But around the time Dafoe ejaculated blood onto Gainsbourg's face and shirt, and then crawled out of the house with a sharpening stone drilled through his leg and beat a live crow to death with his bare hands while Gainsbourg cut off her girlie-parts with a dull pair of safety scissors, I was like, ""Kay, I'm done eating this beef stroganoff.""Oh yeah, spoiler alert. Or whatever.I guess my overall impression is that, while I more or less enjoyed the film, and I respect the imagery used, in the end it was too much disturbia to sit through for a film I didn't really understand the point of.See it if you want.",Antichrist

After the death of their child, we watch a married couple descend into madness and violence. However, we never get to know these two people well enough to care much about their fate. Their hallucinations, delusions, and violent behaviors seem unrealistic, almost random. Perhaps viewers who are less familiar with the true nature of mental illness would find this movie less irritating and more disturbing, as it was clearly intended to be. There are a couple of graphic scenes which may offend some viewers. However, I think most will just find the movie to be unpleasant and boring.",Antichrist

But not at the beginning of your morning, as this movie is not for sensitive eyes.It is about grief, the loss of a child. As I never had or wanted to have children I just could not feel that much empathy towards the characters that that alone could hold my attention. I have never checked my phone more than I did while watching this movie.I really liked both Nymphomaniac movies and was sad that they were over, so I watched this as IMDb said it is a trilogy of Trier's.

The film has a melancholy and uneasy tone throughout which stayed with me long after viewing the film. Antichrist has lush cinematography and amazing directing that gives the film it's own distinctive look, it also contains one of the best opening scenes I have ever watched.Charlotte Gainsbourgh and Willem Dafoe pull off realistic and haunting performances, and I have great respect for the commitment to their roles in the film. The special effects were surprising frequent but incredibly well done, and they had a real presence in the film due to the color.Antichrist is a disturbing and emotionally moving film.

404,frans-vandamme,Chaos Reigns,10,13 November 2013,"We've all seen plenty of horror movies that were obscene for the sake of it, and for whose writers obscenity, for want of of originality, was the only way they could come up with to try and frighten their audience. This is not one of them. The explicit content of Antichrist is meant to make us feel exposed. It exposes the darkest parts of the human psyche, and that is what all good horror is supposed to do. Fiction that is psychological is more than just a story: it's not about the characters, it's about human beings. It's about us, and that's what makes it so frightening. It delves into the unconscious mind, using imagery from dreams, because that's exactly what madness is - dreams changing places with reality. It speaks to us in a language that we know, somehow, deep down, a language strange but not alien. The unknown is frightening, but even more frightening is something we know but don't want to know. Antichrist isn't just about a tragedy. Once you recover from the obscenities in the movie and dare to take a closer look, you see that Antichrist is actually, first and foremost, a deep-going philosophical work. It touches upon some of the big issues, but what it says about them is hard to put in words. It's about absurdity, one could say, and how one can lose one's mind being faced with it - but that's a big word. It's about how our minds are part of nature, and how in nature - in the murderous consequences of love's absence - chaos reigns.",Antichrist

The long and short of it is that this is an incomplete (or indeed very poorly edited) movie. Von Trier wants to achieve so much, both content and style wise, but unfortunately he accomplishes neither, much to the great expense of the content. Que'l surprise! Dafoe's character is so 2D that it's a wonder this movie wasn't a monologue. The husband-wife element is so at odds with reality that we never feel that Dafoe is more than her therapist (by the way). This begins to grate fast! The use of 'real' sex - well, let's open a can of worms: What a pointless exercise in over-realism in a medium where realism is all but an illusion! And even with the use of the real sex, the direction and choreography is mostly so stylized that it still looks like a Basic Instinct out-take! Clearly, Von Trier had a vision in mind. He failed. This is of course my opinion, but I have reached it by taking into account movies of a similar genre that have succeeded. This won't stand beside those! To call Gainsbourg's and Dafoe's respective performances 'heroic' is a gross misjudgment of talent and direction. Seriously, the use of 'real' sex - what a bloody gimmick!!!!

A book the wife was working on the husband finds in the attic that looks like it was done in the year 1200 with weird drawings and so forth? Wow...I'm lost.

It most assuredly is not.The movie starts promising enough, with the tragic death of their toddler son, which occurs while they are having sex. It sets the scene for what could/should have been a deep psychological exploration of grief at it's most damaging. Sadly, that opportunity is missed as the story plods along very slowly as it portrays her scenery-chewing overacting as the grieving mother. He sees it as a grand experiment. He's a therapist, see, and instead of making sure his wife gets appropriate treatment for her debilitating grief, he decides to take her to a cabin way out in the woods to force her to face her fears and anxieties. Apparently he is not a particularly good therapist.In the mix of all of this, there are numerous very graphic sex scenes that I suppose are intended to be daring and artsy. Ooh, look! There's a penis! Gosh, she's touching herself! *Yawn* As the story oh so slowly slowly progresses, having had enough of his failed attempts at curing her of her grief, she finally goes off her nut and does horrible things to him, very nearly resulting in his death. She then mutilates herself in an apparent bid to punish herself for having sexual pleasure. Of course, all of the mutilation and abuse is portrayed vividly and graphically. Because an extreme close up of a woman chopping off her clitoris with scissors is art.Interlaced throughout the story are random references inserted regarding her thesis about women being abused throughout history...which she eventually interprets as meaning women are evil. Oh yeah, there's a talking fox, too. And an extreme close up of a baby bird covered with ants and then eaten by a hawk. All in graphic detail because of course.This is just bad, slow, vastly overacted and self-important drivel. Do yourself a favor and give this one a miss.

I didn't feel like I was watching a movie, rather watching someone's sick fantasy come to life. Now I have seen most of the underground, dark material that everyone talks about, such as August underground, Guinea Pig and A Serbian film.

It just isn't a very good movie. The point of this film can be reduced to something as simple as Von Trier showing his contempt for just about everything. Nature is portrayed as destructive force, an eternal process of death, and while a good movie certainly can be made around that premise, Antichrist quickly spirals out of control into some psychosexual parable about women being evil. Or something; the theme of witchcraft is clumsily shoved in by having Willem Dafoe find some spooky books in the attic. And while I find the overall point of the movie to be morally objectionable, it ultimately fails to present its twisted morality in an interesting or engaging way. Yes, women are witches, the world is evil, we get it, but so what? It just seems hollow, and when it all becomes tedious, the movie attempts to reconquer our attention by showing us graphic acts of violence. Sometimes it seems that a one-dimensional portrayal of an evil world drenched in a distinct directional style is the only criterion for something to warrant the distinction of ""art"".

One of the largest issues that people have with this film is what it decides to show. It has a lot of gore and nudity, but I can't say it is gratuitous. It's not a grindhouse movie; the nudity really only shows the film's ability to deal with mature themes, and the gore - when it does appear - is almost entirely to lend itself to some symbolic or plot-furthering motive. The film itself seems quite heavily rooted in religious themes (if you hadn't guessed by the title), but it is pretty hard to tell what exactly all of the symbols, imagery and subtext surmounts to, what it's trying to show. Predictably Trier has not come up with an answer to most of it, instead he goes on about how the film ""came to him"", which in my books is a very roundabout way of excusing a film that pretends to have substance beneath the immediately obvious plot where none exists. That said, the movie stands up on its own quite well and doesn't really require much explaining from the director to do so - although it certainly would be nice. Whilst being easily more successful, it isn't far from Refn's 'The Neon Demon' in the way that it ends up being a meaningless flick rather than something with deep, thought- provoking concepts.

I came into Antichrist expecting something disturbing...half way through the film I was just hoping for some gore. Wow that was horribly overplayed. There are 2 moments in the film which I guess are getting a lot of buzz. A movie like Storm Warning which is a run of the mill straight to DVD horror film has a woman forcing a shatter glass bottle in her vagina to injure the rapist/badguy. Gutterballs a Bmovie slasher has just as violent if not more so with a close up shot of a penis being sliced in half. I guess growing up with the internet or becoming an avid horror movie fan you become numb to some gore moments. There is one very creative gore moment in Antichrist which deserves a mention which involves the drill.

But as frightening as it seems it also contains hope. As if to show that life must go on, a symbolic threesome of the three wise men in the form of a deer, a fox and a crow shows up in the end. In some of von Triers other films we meet women who sacrifice themselves and one feels sympathy for them. In this movie it is the the other way around. The female character is extremely dislikeable and displays a schizophrenic personality. As I understand this movie was made as a chathartic cleansing from a depression Von Trier had due to his mothers way of bringing him up. I hope he was cured (((((; All hail the downwards spiral !!!! peace out.",Antichrist
424,esbenridder,"Simple story, uncompromisingly told",9,27 May 2009,"First things first: Yes, I am Danish. And yes, Danes do tend to go see Trier's movies because he's our number one international director. But no, Danes are not positively biased towards the man and his work. Lots of people loathe him, can't stand his hubris or his quirks. I for one couldn't stand Dancer in the Dark, not because it's a bad film but because I couldn't stand the depressing story. I simply couldn't accept the premise: A von Trier film is a piece of art. It's not made for me, it's made for von Trier. If I choose to pay money to watch it, that's fine, but it wasn't why it was made. This time around I accepted this simply premise. I went to see the movie much as I'd go to an art gallery. It actually annoyed me somewhat that I had to sit through the movie in a normal theatre. There was plenty of people around who acted just like I used to act: Cracking jokes and laughing when things got too awful. I guess it's a defensive mechanism, but it's a surefire way to completely miss out. You HAVE to embrace the intimacy, the artistic vision, the fact that you're a guest in von Triers 'house'.I loved this movie. Loved the way it crawled under my skin, made me think and feel at the same time. Movies hardly ever manage both. It's a very simple story about guilt, fear and insanity. Simple in the sense that it's not all that hard to decipher. But it's so uncompromising. You're forced to experience every aspect of the fear, the guilt and the insanity. I've never seen anything like it. The only thing that keeps me from giving this movie a 10 is the talking fox. Just couldn't quite make that work for me. Reminds me too much of my talking cow...",Antichrist
425,beatrizmcd,Too far with this one?,5,4 September 2009,"I'm a fan of Lars Von Trier's work, I swear I am, and I still can't wrap my mind around this one. Sure, the imagery is powerful: the graphic violence, the sexuality, the almost alive woods. But this we know Trier is good at. It's well filmed, filled with the close ups he so adores, the music is fascinating and helps drag you into the story until the characters seem to jump out of the screen, something which Trier has proved to be very talented at.Still, the whole idea behind this, women as nature and emotion, raw and unstoppable, men as rationality and intelligence... Well, it all seems to get just a bit lost within the talk of good and evil, the sudden violence and the Christian imagery. It ends up being so confusing that there's almost no message in there at all... It just makes me wonder whether I'm too dumb to understand this one or if Trier has gone a bit too far and ended up with something self-indulgent and void.I'll recommend it to people who already know Trier's work and who are ready to expose themselves to something that even for him can be described as ""weird"".

I loved ""Dogville"" and ""Dancer in the dark"". But this ""film"" just destroyed my hope for purpose of anything that Trier has made so far. It is said little, it was a huge disappointment. It was an hour and a half of a torture. My friends didn't believe me that this film is so bad, so I came to the cinema for the second time with them. They all were shocked and I couldn't stop myself from saying ""I told you so!"". On both sessions, nearly one-third of the audience just left the cinema after the first twenty minutes. Another 10 viewers left the cinema after the first gruesome scene with male genitals. Those who withstand the end, showed nothing else than a huge disappointment. The next scene with female genitals is just sick and disgusting. Generally, genitals seem to be the main topic of this film.I have seen dozens of films. But I haven't been so touched so far. It is totally incomprehensible for me that the author of the brilliant ""Dogville"" is the same person that filmed this porno-gore. And it's not just me - it can be confirmed by the whole audience that left the cinema with the grimace of dissatisfaction on their faces.The most stupid and lunatic film I have ever seen.

This film comes across as a pathetic cry for attention from Lars Von Trier who as a grown man should know better. Breaking the Waves is a fantastic film by the same director which says so much more about grief, distress and relationships than Antichrist does. Having read a number of reviews which described the film as a terrifying unforgettable experience I didn't experience any of these emotions and found the whole thing quite pointless and totally over-hyped.",Antichrist
428,sonicalchemy,Found it so pretentious to have dedicated this gore trip to the great Andrei Tarkovsky,6,30 March 2011,"Just watched the film and can't say many positive things about it, it was simply a venture into the morbid mind of the director. Although I do appreciate Art, like Claire Denis's ""Trouble Everyday"", Takashi Miike's ""Audition"", Gaspar Noe's ""I Stand Alone"", etc, etc. Yes throughout the film I did say to myself this looks a bit like Tarkovsky but not in any way sense or form in regards to the plot of this story. Fine he wanted to make a point which I am still looking to find, I enjoy cinematography and will never stop watching what I have started. It all would have been long forgotten had he not dedicated the film to Andrei who is by far the best director that I have ever seen. His grace of depicting the deepest part of ourselves makes him an absolute genius of our times (Tarkovsky that is). This director does use the 4 elements like Andrei, many lectures and philosophy but not in the poetic ways he always did. This is all in my opinion, I would never have thought of criticizing his work, I just did not think it was necessary to dedicate such a morbid yet brilliant picture to Andrei. He did not need to make a dedication, people that do enjoy good films would have seen and felt the inspirations all over, even though he used the complete opposite of Tarkosky. I will not invalidate any of his efforts because I would only be invalidating myself, then I would never get to see the big picture. I did enjoy his work in my own way, I don't find a reason to ever watch it again but who knows the day of tomorrow?I thank him for his Artistic point of view and will even recommend this to others along with Stalker and see what their comments will be.",Antichrist
429,troublesandra,Antichrist - Chaos reigns,9,7 April 2010,"Even if you do not know the works of Lars von Trier, at the latest after some minutes it is obvious that Antichrist is not a typical ""Hollywood movie"". It starts with this beautiful black and white slow-motion Prologue, which is completed through Händel's opera Rinaldo. This scene consists of a combination of a lot of Close-Up and extreme Close-up shots, especially from the parents having sex, and the last minutes in Nic's life. For me it was a little bit startling that I sensed the sequence as so extremely beautiful and poetical; although Nic is dying. Together with the Epilogue, which has a similar style, it frames the rest of the movie. The four other chapters contain lots of violence, sex, pain and desperateness. As nearly everything is shown, some put it into the ""gorno"" genre. On the one hand showed violence gets more grueling with the time and some scenes test the ""staying power"" of the audience; even the sex scenes get rougher. But on the other hand the movie does not only consist of these elements. There are scenes between, which let the audience ""breathe""; like when we see here going in slow-motion over the bridge or when he is standing in the rain. All these scenes are connected by her belief that nature is Satan's church and that it brings out the true nature in women. The longer they stay in the cabin the more the nature influences her and the more desperateness it gets. As he finds out about her beliefs, it is too late to ""turn"" the story around. In the end he subordinates himself under her belief and strangles her as the three baggers are on the right place. All the evilness is conveyed also by stylistic elements. I want to highlight two elements. On the one hand you find some similarities to Tarkovsky: nature, play with colour and black and white, many shots connected with water, dream/therapy scenes and lots of images, which are extraordinarily beautiful. Tarkovsky is also known for his ""sculpturing in time"", where he uses mostly real time. Lars von Trier does not use it in the same way, but he also influences the time perception of the audience by means of slow motion; so you lose the sense of time in these shots, like when she is going to the cabin in her thoughts. On the other hand you have the usage of colour. The main colours (except for nature of course) are between blue- and greyish. As blue is connected with passivity and powerlessness, it punctuates the films mood. A contrast to that built yellow. First it is connected with Nic and it is therefore mostly sunny. Later as she is wearing the yellow raincoat, it is more like a warning; the evil cannot be stopped. Additionally you can find red spots in her clothes; this could be interpreted as sign that her true nature is alive, but maybe it goes too far.To sum up, I can say, that it is not the movie you watch when you want to have easy entertainment and to know everything after one time seeing it. But I can recommend it, if you like thinking about the contents and finding out new things by several times watching it. When you are able to take the gruesome shots, you will be rewarded with these extremely beautiful images between. Whether you love or hate it, it is impossible to do not think about it.",Antichrist

Unexpected, sensual, brutal in a sensitive way since it refers to our inner beast. Right before seeing the dedication in the end I was indeed thinking of Tarkovsky.. Also, I simply love the way he brings theater in his films, he truly is an artist. Of course I don't believe that the genuineness of this film can apply to the majority of the viewers.

I have always been a fan of Charlotte's music, and I have seen her previous acting in ""The Cement Garden."" William Dafoe's previous work is also quite addicting because he can play so many different roll types. I tend to go for movies with only few characters, it makes it seem more realistic for me. So I was interested in watching this movie so I sat down with a bowl of cereal in the morning and began the show. I could NOT stop watching it within 10 minutes of the movie. The way it was directed and filmed is absolutely beautiful, I felt like I was inside of a dream.

When I recall all the explicit nudity, the genital mutilation, and talking animals I can only conclude that watching this astonishing pile of graphic nonsense does not contribute anything to the genre of either drama or horror. It can't even be defined as art, for art entertains, educates or criticizes. 'The Antichrist' clearly does not fit in anywhere, except for the long list of disappointing horror stories that try to stun and 'shock and awe'.The story itself commences rather interesting, after the exposed set of genitalia the audience is introduced to the accidental death of a son. From then on, realism and sympathy turn into disgust, disbelieve and regret for ever watching such an appalling piece of cinematography. The storyline becomes more ridicule every second the movie progresses and after a while it eventually loses all its credibility and logic.If you've got any other way to spend your time, or maybe watch a real interesting, intense and entertaining film, I would say: DO IT NOW!",Antichrist

The real ""good"" guy in this film, in my opinion is the child, who in the beginning sweeps away the grieve, fear and despair and happily throw himself into death.

I too believe that film must be 'like a stone in your shoe'. Antichrist was at all times engaging, much of the time painfully uncomfortable and some of the time very revealing. The violence portrayed is no more graphic than some of the rubbish vomited out by American studios, but far more frightening in its intelligent psychology. I felt a distinct 'enemy in woman' in this work and reading von Triers experience with his mothers revelation on her death bed that his father was never the man he thought, I feel this was where his expression may have stemmed. Great performances, exquisite beauty in some of the slow motion compositions, frightening psychological and physical violence... everything a horror should be.

For the hour and 40 I was sat in my seat I was bombarded by a free-fall of blatant and obvious metaphors sandwiched between edited clips of the selfish tripe that was flowing from His and Her ""grief-addled"" minds.The cinematography was brilliant, the shots were beautifully composed, most wouldn't be out of place as still images on their own. The sound and post production was perfect, a litany of heart thudding moments and breath holding captured by the crescendo of rushing winds and thudding acorns. But even these can't make up for the fallacies of the storyline.He never left his therapist mindset. Even with his leg weighted with concrete, or as he was strangling his patient his face was blank. The film was essentially all about Her and her evolving stance on women, nature and their corresponding evil.I'm sure a film student would love to study this piece as the bulls**t they could write on how sex juxtaposed with a dead tree symbolises this and that till the end of days.

438,davidcrankhouser,LVT... talent supreme...sybarite extreme,2,28 August 2009,"If you are a fan of cinema that plays the art house scene, then you should go support the art house by paying full price and purchasing the absurdly priced snacks.As for ""scary"" or some kind of mind ""#%*@,"" not really. As for plot, not so much. The film resembles more of a dream than a linear story. The incorporation of a Biblical theme, Adam, Eve, Garden of Eden, and Evil lurking, parallel at best. Had the theme not been included, her descent into madness would have been no less convincing. The allusions to the destruction of women throughout the ages, while accurate, are counter to the story as she becomes the embodiment of the ""reasons given to torture women"" in Europe of the 1600's.Great things about the movie to be included later. But first, the viewer might find themselves rightly disappointed in that the devolution of the woman into madness is only partially halted by the ""rational Man's"" attempts to save the woman who is never his equal. LVT mentions that none of the perversions in this movie are new to cinema just differently done. The greatest perversion not mentioned by other reviewers is that in moments that demand great strength and courage and the exercise of all that aids in the triumph of the human spirit, woman is ultimately devoid of them. A more fair treatment would have been the demonstration of the weaknesses, frailties, and irrationalities of both man and woman. But alas, LVT's recent cinematic expression is a millennium old perversion that evil is resident in women and must be purged by men.As for the graphic scenes of sex and masturbation, LVT has nothing to offer that hasn't been already rendered banal by hundreds of other films.Worthy expressions of LVT's talent: His direction of the two actors brings out some of the finest acting in the last decade. You'll have to turn a blind eye to some of the clunky dialog, but not often. His choice of cinematographer to bring his vision to the screen was near perfect. The stylization and camera work, including post production work are truly expression of master crafting.Overall, the movie reminded me most of Mapplethorp. Towering genius and talent too often spent is attempts to shock or ""push the limits."" Long before Mapplethorp and LVT was the Japanese movie ""Woman in the Dunes"" and its cousin ""Onibaba."" Sadistic violence and slow-mo vaginal penetration are the staple of slasher films and sex-ploitation ""films."" Their inclusion in this film brought the film down to the level of an Annabel Chong endeavor.LVT does finally what most cinema has been too timid to attempt: the use of sexual stimulation, either with a partner or frenetic, near self abusive masturbation in an attempt to avoid the pain of existence through short lived endorphin release of climax is dead on. Few have hit the nail so squarely as LVT in demonstrating that sexual climax as a coping mechanism has severely diminishing returns. That's the best psychology in the movie. The rest is just freshman textbook nattering.The real title of the movie should not be Antichrist. It should be LVT's Well Executed but Pointless Dream.",Antichrist
439,Redhunt,Pretentious with a glacial speed and bone dry dialogue = an effective antidote for insomnia,3,19 September 2009,"Dafoe's movie-in-movie of Mr. Bean 2 gives new meaning after this snail paced wreck of a film. The caricature of heavily stylized soulless film making in Bean 2 was actualized in Antichrist. The gratuitous usage slow motion capture in a bleached back drop with catatonic dialogue drenched of all genuine emotion all rears their ugly heads. Antichrist follows precedent with an equally sparse musical score and forced, paper dry acting while static imagery with poor lighting cannot be construed, regardless of differing opinions, as good cinematography when regarded with actual examples of quality in the market.The movie is set up as a protracted therapy session your psychiatrist, exchanging the doctor's office with the living room and the professional relationship a personal one. Inter spiced are intermittent dream sequences where the patient's thoughts of the loss of her child are materialized. (first 5 minutes establishes this) As feared, words, tone and sentence structure resembles reality which aims to sooth and relax the patient, and when used with a stubborn case of non-editing, static camera work and monotone coloring, leads to a snore fest in a darken room. Perceivable deterioration of the characters comes so late into the film that's it's hard to argue that the lengthy buildup was necessary.The much discussed redeeming factor, the shock value of the level of depravity depicted by the protagonists, is an act of cowardice by the film makers when in comparison with the boldness and originality of Àl'intérieur (Interior).Audiences which are familiar with Dafoe recent main-man films will undoubtedly be familiar with what to expect of this film.

440,petteri-10,Great movie,10,31 August 2009,I think the movie was one of the best ones I've ever seen. Anticrist was made to be felt rather than to be understand. This reminds me a lot of David Lynch's movies which I love. There was a lot of symbols in the movie but the good thing was the subjects were universal and therefore understandable (unlike some Lynch movies). Actors did the great job! My interpretation is that the woman actually murdered the child (or made it happened). Man found her notes from the attic and it was shown that she had lost her mind during writing the thesis. She had also tortured the child with wearing shoes to wrong feet. At the first scene the was also a shot that the cry alarm was turned mute - perhaps on purpose? At other scene later on there was shown that woman actually watched the child as he stood on table.But as I said earlier there's no point of trying to rationalize this movie. Masterpiece.,Antichrist

The undercurrents of symbolism captured you, even if they had no deep meaning. However, this movie was graphic, nonsensical, and utterly ridiculous. In the first scene, I was overcome with laughter, which, as far as I am concerned, is not supposed to happen when a small child jumps from a second story window. In fact, I found myself snickering in some of the most inappropriate parts of this movie. Defoe totally creeped me out during this entire movie, which was another factor that turned me off. This movie also seems to be more about the couple's sexual relationship than the plot behind it. Of course, the wife's addiction was the main reason for Nick's death, nevertheless, I believed the massive amounts of it was unnecessary. Also, the main actress seems to spiral into insanity almost out of nowhere. And the symbolism, while connecting together, never fully came across to me. The three beggars role in this film was never identified. All in all, this movie kept me scratching my head. It disappoints me that it wasn't as good as I expected it to be.

It was a very dark film both visually and atmospherically, and at some points it was odd, uncomfortable and attempting to be shocking. Unfortunately it failed to have any shock/gore factor and lacked in any sort of 'evil' presence.There were a lot of loose ends and open ended points/questions and it was hard to have a sense of fulfillment at the end.It was also unnecessarily explicit, and I cannot even begin to justify much if not any of the sexual material in it being so graphic.

448,serge-546-55392,Essentially a version the Christ-story,8,3 October 2009,"A rather simple tale, essentially a version of Christ sacrifice-and-redemption story, which continues Von Trier's preoccupation with female Christ-like figures. Instead of god you have nature (as a kind of anti-god), and instead of Christ/son a woman/daughter (as a kind of anti-Christ in a non-biblical sense). Her awakening to her terrible destiny is marked by a crying child's voice in the sky (instead of the star of Bethlehem), her final expulsion from the social into the realm of nature is accomplished by the trauma of the loss of a child, her final coming into her own is marked by the act of circumcision (self-imposed; but a right of passage which Christ like any Jewish male must have suffered), and her confirmation is attended by ""three beggars"" instead of three Wisemen (fox, raven, and a dear), as she lies on the floor that could easily pass for that of a manger. The story ends with the woman's violent death which brings a sort of cleansing or redemption to nature (expressed with a color switch and more peaceful shots of the forest). The final shot adds a nice touch with a multitude of faceless women ascending a mountain like a flock of pilgrims. They appear essentially harmless and somewhat spectral. Maybe one could venture something like this: just like after Christ's sacrifice the visages of men serve only as a kind of reminder of what the true Man looked like, here the post-redemptive image of a woman lacks the intensity and the fierce personality of the original sacrificial victim. The film's treatment of the relationship between nature and cruelty is somewhat reminiscent of Octave Mirbeau's Torture Garden, but Von Trier's treatment of nature is much softer – essentially it's close to what nature really looks like outside of tourist catalogs. The most surprising thing about the film is a belated sense of lyricism which one feels looking back on it, once the more violent images fade from memory. A nice film but probably not for children.",Antichrist
449,guillermoalbrieu,Morality on facts and the mechanical pragmatism of ignorants.,10,8 October 2009,"(I'm so sorry for my poor English usage) I found the film really beautiful and full of poetry. Yes, in spite of the hard images. I don't like people analyzing art ONLY through the lens of morality. How can it be a ""gore"" film with such a beautiful and dense script, EXCELLENT performances and photographic richness. I guess most people can't just perceive beyond icons. If blood, penis, or death are TOO TABOO for you... don't blame the artists, but put some critic eyes on your schools.

450,admanc,Dreadfully Boring,2,13 October 2009,"I really wanted to like this movie a lot, especially since Willem Dafoe was at the premier and in the movie theater with us during the showing. However, the only anti-Christ I found in this movie is the fact that it bored the living Jesus right out of me for the entire first hour or more. The best part of the movie was the opening 5 minutes. Simply gorgeous and incredible cinematography that Lars should be commended for. Unfortunately, the next 50 minutes of the story and plot-line is so ridiculously uninteresting and slow-moving that it is excruciatingly difficult to keep paying attention, nor do you care enough about the characters to remain focused. It's a lot to ask of an audience to stay with you for that long of a time with nothing remotely interesting, appealing, educational or entertaining happening on the screen. In the movie, a couple is mourning the death of their only child. This movie is about as entertaining as being at the funeral of a stranger and then being a trapped fly on the wall in their house as they grieve...for days and days and days and days and days...oh wait, that's exactly what the movie was about. It's not LIKE that...it IS that. And then, in the last 30 minutes of the movie, Lars throws in some bloody and graphic violence, followed by some pointless symbology (deer/bird/fox), some genital mutilation culminating in strangulation and then calls it a masterpiece. Voila! No thanks.",Antichrist
451,brad-564-736617,Just Saw This Film And...,7,25 October 2009,"... here's the deal. If Andres Serrano, Friedrich Neitszche, and Hermann Rorschach made a film, it would probably be a lot like Antichrist. The film definitely panders to a particular kind of cerebral audience, but should be respected by all as a celebration of the First Amendment. While much of the film's symbolism will be debated, I don't think anyone will dispute that Antichrist is not a popcorn film. No one should even go to see a movie called ""Antichrist"" if they're ill-prepared for something unholy or refuse to give the screenwriter's representation any artistic credence. Much like Mel Gibson's brutal depiction of Jesus' walk to Golgotha, Antichrist challenges us to take that walk ourselves by way of its sullen, decadent, and exploitative descent into madness. Lars Von Trier certainly did not make this film to win a shiny Hollywood adornment for his mantle. Antichrist doesn't cut away where other films claiming to be horrific would, but its vulgar imagery is a necessary reminder that the religious book we extrapolate joy from every Sunday has blood-soaked pages. An honest look into Judeo-Christian history would reveal far more disturbing violence than a movie that only simulates it. While some movies (i.e Paranormal Activity) make their impact by things unseen, Antichrist ""nails"" us with things seen. I've seen movies (i.e Salo, Cannibal Holocaust, August Underground, Caligula, etc) that were far less effective at using visual disturbance as an artistic device. Antichrist is not the kind of film that you and your date will want to talk about over a slice of pie at Denny's. Contrarily, it rehashes necessary discussion about the nature of evil and should have people running to Barnes and Noble to learn a little more about the millions of people who consequently suffered miserably under torture to make religion the cozy racket it is today. Antichrist, though some want to say is a misogynist director's demented sublimation, is perhaps a fitting reminder that sometimes bad things happen to bad people. Though the movie begins with us empathizing with a distraught woman over the loss of her son, we later realize that she was the antagonist in protagonist clothing. Her neglect, cruelty, and carnal self-indulgence incubated an unrivaled depravity and her thesis paper on religion helped her project her own self-loathing. She was coming undone -- and I was happy to see her finished.",Antichrist
452,Jlcthirteen,haha really?,3,5 November 2009,"""Wow"" is the first thing that comes to mind after I watched this film. Not because it was any good... at all, but because the hype was so undeserved. Maybe I'm not as deep or ""intellectual"" as many of these critics seem to be, but apart from a few nice cinematic shots, this film offered nothing. The symbolism is so meaningless that it is entirely up to the audience what they would like to take away from it. It seemed like the director didn't even have a motive behind making the film other than to shock.Then again, I am not one who understands this ""modern art"" movement. Throwing paint, feces, and menstrual blood onto a canvas and claiming its the misogyny that surrounds womanly sexuality is just crap. A good director or artist has purpose and delivers his point. Not to say that symbolism is not warranted, but making it as obscure as in this film makes me think the director didn't have a clue what he was doing.Overall, the film's pace was too slow and the only parts I found interesting were the psychotherapy techniques being since they are relevant to my profession. As we've seen before, great camera work doesn't make up for a bad film.Rating: 3/10 - and that's being very generous.",Antichrist
453,e_ryn,masochism and audience,3,28 November 2009,"I must say I was pretty unimpressed by this movie. It's one thing to say that representing internalized oppression makes it an object of scrutiny and can be liberating but, the genre here is straightforwardly Gothic/Horror and so there isn't a subversive element to the non-dissolution of the symptom the way there would be if there was more going on in terms of genre. Basically there is a woman who has abandoned her thesis on something to do with oppression of women, and a husband who torments her under the guise of healing her (he being a psychoanalyst and she in mourning). The husband is obviously a jerk and the viewer is supposed to identify with the woman but he winds up killing her and this strikes me as very Lacanian: the idea that men not recognizing women's subjectivity or whatever somehow naturalizes women into a weaker position. The film's lack of attention to the its cultural function (i.e. its effect on female viewers especially as a Gothic film eliciting primitive/unconscious responses) is irresponsible in my opinion. But I'm not saying what most reviewers would probably say, which is that the film depicts a disturbing sexual sadism. It's more the opposite (which is of course, the same thing, only differently). My boyfriend pointed out that he thinks the director identifies with all his female leads - which reminds me of a thing I read about s&m porn involving violence against women but intended for a male masochistic audience. In this film, it seems to me that male viewers can identify pleasurably with representations of the degraded female lead and yet all is well at the end because she gets killed off, both the ultimate masochistic passage a l'acte and at the same time something that restores masculinity and brings the gender-crossing fantasy to a comfortable closure. But where does this leave female viewers? In all the old places, seems to me. Female viewers cannot but see the killing as gendered and political. I'm reminded of this article on Toni Morrison that describes the historical experience of certain subjects as one of being subjected to the literalization of the desire of other subjects. Not that I am pro-censorship, I just think that there really needs to be more of a creative engagement of these subjects by female artists.",Antichrist
454,Dakinila,Banal and Deep...,8,4 December 2009,"When I first read the previews of Antichrist, I took the theme of ""nature taking over"" quite literally: That perhaps trees would come alive, maybe some magical realism. I'm not entirely caught up on von Trier's oeuvre, so I came into the film without many expectations. This actually helped me to experience it directly and viscerally, which I suspect is how it is intended to be initially experienced,given you have the stomach for it.The stunning and often slow motion visuals (if anyone has seen ""into silence"" about Benedictine monks, you might find some similarities in the pacing..)will either pull you in or alienate you. I was caught between those two reactions. In looking back on the movie, I now see the layers are so numerous and the graphics so intensely shocking that it's easy to get trapped in one mode of perception--which is, of course, one of his points: That these frameworks of perception--rationality and emotionality, good and evil, sexuality as nurturance and as violence, control and submission--are not statically dualistic, And yet the movie pushes us, over and over, into identifying with one or the other. Even our response to the movie mirrors this...The relationship between Dafoe and Gainbourg and their child plays this out: Who is evil? She is crippling the child, and yet her therapist-husband, in his god-complex, begins crippling her. Gainsbourg's attempt to deform the child's feet in Eden is repeated through Dafoe's bringing her to a place where she cannot walk, where she is in a childlike state and reduced to his care.When she's actually able to walk through the woods again, transcending the role, her triumph is not even recognized by her ""savior""...and we see her next back in bed, crippled. By the time she attaches the grindstone to his leg, it's only the most overt and shocking of these attempts to control the ""other."" I don't believe von Trier was presenting a simple stereotype of woman as nature/chaos/carnality and man as reason/order/transcendence. The film's promo of ""nature taking over"" is a set-up, already defining our perception and therefore challenging us to question it. Defoe's character is too robotic, cut off from everything, to be considered rational especially when he too, is having visions. And he is not exactly the bastion of reason. He blindly pursues his wife's ""cure"" until it turns into hubris, making his actions as extreme as Gainsberg's emotionality--they are just less graphic.I have to wonder what would have happened if Gainsbourg, after their child's death, was taken into the care of a different psychiatrist. If the demon she obviously identifies within herself was acknowledged directly, an entirely different film would have been made. Dafoe's insistence that he ""take her"" changes everything, and yet, he is not logical in that choice because his care is inconsistent--he did leave her for a summer in the woods with their young child, in a place as close to ""into the wild"" as you'd ever want to get, and he knew she doing it while studying the history of female torture. hmmm...Gainberg's obsessive studies with Gynocide and the oppression of woman must have generated an original grief and despair we don't really see except for her face in that one Polaroid of her and the child. No doubt that played a role into her later desperate actions--the sexual frenzy, trying to secure her child to her through binding his feet, and also submitting herself to her husband's care.Gainsbourg sublimates everything to the point where she becomes what she fears and Defoe, an adept of denial despite his claims to know ""reality"" externalizes to the point where he perceives and lives what he tries to rationally deny.The oppositions, and reversals are endless: woman as creator vs destroyer; the city vs the forest; man vs woman; redemption vs damnation; emotion vs reason; sex as the beginning of life and as the end of it. These dynamics, especially between Dafoe and Gainsbourg, play like Greek tragedy, each action taken brings the characters against their will to further demise and a terrible climax.How this experience translates for the viewer is going to be very personal. I was alternately entranced and shocked by the movie's imagery, and even the characters seem to experience this. Trance states, ecstasy, anguish, moments that last for minutes, total frenzy.It seems the movie demands you experience and understand it on this same level of dualism, reversal, and polarization that sadly reinforce what we are trying to escape. Gainbourg becomes the witch who needs to be destroyed, and Fafoe ends up powerless,eating berries and surrounded by woman. Maybe the jokes on us, trying to figure this one out and find definite meaning? For some people, Antichrist will be experienced as banal, shocking and meaningless. For others, its complexity and meaning is very deep. I believe both views are right.",Antichrist
455,temabraha,Incredible Horror Film,9,5 December 2009,"To me this film that was an enigma. I left the theater uncertain about it, and even a little disappointed, as no doubt other audience members were. But the more I thought about it, the more the film began to open up to me. This has to be one of the most incredible films I've ever seen simply because it has left me with such a powerful (not to mention grisly) impression.The surreal, stylized prologue was astonishing. The couple played by William Defoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg are doing the nasty in the shower in slow-mo (set to classical opera) as their young child leaps out of bed then leaps out the window. There's even a quick shot of penetration that defies description (CGI perhaps?) As they both climax the little boy smacks the snow covered ground. They begin to grieve the lost of their child, well she grieves and he tries to treat her as if she was one of his patients (he is a psychiatrist). His lack of sorrow is stunning, and her grieving seems to overwhelm her, with even a lost of control of her body, she tries humping her husband after slamming her head on the sink and wakes up at night with panic attacks (there's an interesting tableaux of shots showing the physiological reactions of her anxiety which reappears again around the end of the film).He has her tell him what her fears are, where she feels most vulnerable. It is at Eden, their woodland retreat. They go there and this is when the movie truly descends down a hellish path and an evil atmosphere pervades the film.On the hike to the cottage, there is an elegant scene when Defoe comes across a doe who turns around to run reveling that it is giving birth. He is obviously taken aback by this. And later on Defoe is touched with premonition among the ferns when he comes across a satanic talking fox with its entrails exposed who utters a warning of impeding doom.I think the film reveals the dark side of nature (including human nature) vividly. Scenes of ants crawling on the carcass of a dead bird, a hawk feeding on the bird, the fox wriggling around with its guts out, a trees' limbs falling apart. And what could be more true about the underbelly of the natural world with its birth, death, decay, fornication, and animals devouring each other. A cycle of fear and pain. Those dark woods are mysterious and evil. According to Gainsbourg's character, nature controls a women's body, and she admits to Defoe of the evil nature of women.What about her child's autopsy report that reveals that he had a foot deformity, doesn't the x-rays of his foot looks like hooves? Was her child the reincarnation of Satan? And what about what she tells Defoe about the previous time she was at Eden with only the boy with her. He would wander off into the woods, and his cries would be bellowed out by the wilderness. As she worked on her thesis about the women of witchcraft and persecutions, she herself seems to have been possessed by evil (pages of scribbles, putting on the child's shoes the wrong way). And if she is indeed the Antichrist's mother, I'm sure shes already evil. Either way, the film is striking in this respect and leaves you pondering. It is an incredible horror film! As the film progresses we see her sexual acts turn masochistic, and they end up fornicating like a-couple of pagans beneath a sacred grove where the limbs of dead bodies are intertwined with the roots of the tree and the earth. And finally she reveals her true in nature in the woods as an evil abomination of female chaos, with a bit of witchery mythology included, the concept of the ""three beggars"" with the doe, fox, and crow. Then there are scenes with genital mutilation that are painful to watch, and will leave you cringing (no doubt Von Triers intentions). I thought these scenes were a bit excessive, and unnecessary.Defoe ends up like all the other men in history as a persecutor of female nature, and she becomes like all other women whose bodies cover the earth... she is put to death and women and nature are one. In the ending, as he leaves the woods, he sees that women are everywhere in the wilderness. Their sheer numbers ascending the hill towards him, it is an astonishing and a mystifying end to such a film.",Antichrist

The setting of the movie, the imagery is absolutely stunning. Charlotte Gainsbourg and Willem Defoe give amazing performances. Director Lars von Trier makes a raw, brutal and natural portrayal of horror Word of advise as we all know its a usual run of the mill horror film but a deeper psychological examination of insanity. sure there are many gut wrenching scenes but i think they added to the bizarre nature of the film. not for the faint of heart see it and be moved psychologically!!!!!!",Antichrist

It cannot be denied that Antichrist is beautifully filmed (with some quite exquisite moments) and that its leads (Gainsbourg and Defoe) both give superb performances, however, I found the piece as a whole to be rather self-indulgent, heavy handed and mildly offensive. I wasn't offended by the sex, the violence or all those acts that fell awkwardly between the two, but rather by the misogynistic diatribe that was at the heart of Antichrist. To me this is a film made by and for people who (on some level) hate (or more accurately, fear) women or who think they're clever (""deciphering"" all the painfully blatant symbolism therein), but actually are an epitome of ignorance.",Antichrist

It takes GOOD REAL life truth (truth that you can feel and know it's TRUE) and distorts it just enough to make you want to puke!Seeing a good ol' porn movie, masturbate, and feel something is nearer to actual life truth (despite the fact that it's very, very distorted truth about sex and the relationship between a man and a woman) than any feeling this movie produced, but I guess in our porn society that effect is also starting to get to weak for our disturbed minds. And ""Savage grace""?? Incest is the ""new gay"", or what? Maybe sacrificing our children to the ""god of despair"" is the next step in our stupid fallen minds! I guess some things never change, man obviously always stays the same! The reason I gave this movie 1 star and not 0 is simply the fact that at least the title fits. Technically a shining star, brighter than any I have ever seen, but the inside reeks with so much rotten non-truths that for a glimpse it makes you wish you were dead just for the sake of knowing the truth (and by that time it's already to late).

Needless to say, von Trier stante pede moved to my black list.Seriously, this movie is not artistic (except work the camera work), as many before me wrote, this movie is sick. It's not even the disgust factor I have in mind. It's the rotten use of symbols, especially von Trier's comments on the dark sides of Nature, and the motivation that supposedly drives the female character.

462,cassandra-724-852832,I felt force-fed a bucket of entrails,4,28 April 2010,"I will admit I walked out when the female character picked up the scissors . I knew EXACTLY what was coming as I'd been expecting this predictable outcome for some time. By this stage of the movie I felt I had been force fed a gut full of entrails with the same sadistic cruelty reserved for geese in the making of pate-de foie gras with the exception that I had been forced to eat my own liver.My husband a veteran of horror remained in his seat and has been scarred for life by this scene.I have given the film 4 points purely for some of the rare,finer and all to few fragile and beautiful moments. The child falling from the window was oddly moving.My heart was in my mouth and I was captivated in a trance of suspended grief . Another perfect scene was the walk through the subconscious and into the woods over a bridge. A lush and surreal bath for the senses which made the following unwilling descent into swill and grime jarring.My problem was that the film pretended to be subtle and artistic and seductively teased you along with magnificent scenes such as the falling acorns before rudely plunging you into offal and gore in the manner of any slash and guts horror.It was a regular ,disruptive rude and annoying shock that finally lost momentum (and all sympathy for the director) by creating exactly the same repetition of irritating tension achieved by an annoying swarm of mosquitoes.The sex scenes were so in your face ,so childishly determined to shock and disturb (particularly the extended masturbating )that I felt manipulated and treated as if I was an unwelcome voyeur .In the end I cringed and stared at the ceiling as the scenes dragged on and on and on from every disconcerting angle .While I waited I distracted myself by imagining the contents at the back of my fridge. My sighs drove the family dog into a foot gnawing frenzy.The biggest problem I had was loathing the main characters.The child which captured my attention had been disposed of at the beginning of the film and I couldn't help idly wishing they had fallen out the window too.When the dead fox spoke to the husband and croaked ""Chaos reigns"" I collapsed in giggles. It was an incongruous moment and sat ill with the idea that it was only the woman that was mad.At this stage the husbands mental health was questionable particularly as fox looked like it had been pieced together by an insane taxidermist with toothpicks for tools.If you removed an hour of footage you would be left with something haunting and oddly beautiful however the inclusion of every deranged whim without restraint including a penis spurting with blood just pushed this film into the realm of a cluster of regrettable images I would prefer not to clutter my mind .",Antichrist
463,aph5090,Not impressed,4,17 August 2010,"First of all, this is a very well-directed movie, if you leave out the gory parts. Lars von Trier definitely knows what he is doing and he was able to prevent Antichrist from being a completely worthless movie. He and the fantastic two-person cast were able to make this movie quite good in terms of aesthetics. The score was very good too.With that said, I have a long list of complaints. I will, however, try to make it quick. Quite frankly, this movie has an awful plot and no real meaning to the story. It is basically just a series of disturbing scenes that don't accomplish anything more than either grossing the viewer out or making the viewer upset in some way. There are way too many parts that are way too grotesque and perverse that really don't add to the film. I don't mind gore and violence at all, but this movie takes them way too far. Rather than adding them in for the purpose of adding to the thrill of the movie or going along with the storyline, the gore in this movie seemed to be used to make the viewer cringe, be uncomfortable, and have to try to forget what they just saw. Zombies eating human flesh = cool. Mel Gibson hacking at a British soldier that just burned down his house = cool and essential to the story. Woman cutting off her labia with scissors for absolutely no reason at all = disgusting and a feeling of ""why the hell did i just have to see that?"" Just to be clear, the gore wasn't what made it a bad movie, in my opinion. While those scenes were completely unnecessary, the worst part was the lack of plot in the narrative. The story was worthless, and I must commend Lars von Trier for being able to work with it as well as he did.If you are looking for a scary, suspenseful, or thrilling movie, don't bother with this. The entire movie is spent building suspense (which is a plus because it accurately portrays the building tension between the couple) but nothing ever happens when you expect something is about to happen and there is no real climax in the movie. Likewise, if you are looking for a deep, thought-provoking story with a meaningful plot, this movie will horribly disappoint you.I would really only recommend Antichrist if your sole purpose for watching it is to analyze the design of the film, ie: the score, the mise en scene, the visually pleasing scenery, the acting talent, the directing talent, etc. So basically, if you are watching it just to critique the makers of the film rather than the quality of the movie, and you don't mind seeing some things that you will immediately want to erase from your memory. Since this is a suspenseful foreign film with a renowned director, I had high hopes and I really tried to appreciate it and find the deep, hidden meanings in it. But it turned out to just be a waste of my time.",Antichrist

465,sfbaywest,Uncomfortably provoking,7,26 November 2010,"This work is deeply intense, definitely in the first 15minutes, where LVT has used black and white, slow-motion filming artistry, with operatic music backdrop, to lay the groundwork for a seemingly accidental death of a child, while his parents are in the storm of their own lovemaking. If LVT intended to have us feel guilt and grief, I think he established it immensely.Fast forward, the mother's grief appears to plunge her into depression and insanity, while her husband uses rational, scientific psychotherapy to try and cure her, by bringing her to their isolated wood cabin, known as Eden. As the story unfolds, LVT delivers us hints that the mother's insanity has begun much further back than when her child dies from a fall from their window. In fact, it begins when she spends an isolated summer at Eden, with her son, writing her dissertation thesis on the genocide of women in the world's history. Her husband only discovers the true nature of her deterioration when it's too late; first he sources it to Nature, than to Satan, and in his final discovery of her thesis writing in the attic, he concludes that it is Man. Here is where I think LVT reveals his theory on women... he's basically saying that women, in isolation with nature (the previous summer she spends in Eden with her son, but without her husband), begins to unravel and is overcome by fear and dependencies on Man (symbolized by her need to cripple her son's feet by putting his shoes on incorrectly). Instead of thriving in nature (as the husband does while foraging for berries on his own, or her son does by wandering in the woods), or even feeling protected by nature (her husband hiding in the fox hole), the woman deteriorates to the most insecure state in Eden, causing her to destroy her male companionships in the need to ensure that neither her son nor husband can abandon her; over their choice to be with nature (or God).In fact, it is woman's jealousy with man, her fear that man's true love is nature (or God), while woman's true love is Man, that causes her downward spiral into becoming the Antichrist. Dafoe's weight of the spinwheel on his leg into the cave, is also symbolic of Christ carrying the weight of the cross for our sins, and being buried in the cave, to be resurrected. Here, LVT reminds us that God chooses Man as the symbol of himself, through Jesus, while woman, is the original sin, inflicted on all of humanity. Again, LVT uses bibilical referencesto remind us that it is through Woman that Satan inflicts his destruction on Eden and Earth - through fear, depravity, despair and grief. After all, the original sin begins in Eden and in the Epilogue, man is pushed out of Eden to fend for himself (foraging for berries to begin a new life).The graphic violence is not for the weak-hearted; but the theory is worth investigating, whether you agree with it or not.",Antichrist
466,rachelmontreal,A film about collusion and ambivalence,8,25 December 2010,"You won't like this film, but that's not the point. Beautifully shot and horrific in its detail, this film is rich in more themes then my poor little brain can conjure.A couple's baby falls to his death whilst they are having sex. The psychotherapist husband insists on curing his wife of her grief and hikes her off to remote Eden, the antithesis of paradise. There ensues a graphic and deeply disturbing tale about the darkest aspects of our human nature.As a marital therapist, I am going to focus mainly on the psychological themes of this film. However I hope to extrapolate it into some more general overarching themes.It is more then arrogance that makes the husband believe that he can cure his wife. The couple are engaged in a grotesque collusion, that externalizes the dark world of the husband and wife's own internal psyche.By acting out each other's projections, he remains free from paralyzing and bewildering emotions; she remains free from the numbing coldness of reason.In many ways this film depicts the ambivalence with which we all grapple when faced with any form of intimate relationship. On the one hand there is an innate desire to keep the other close. This is reflected in the extreme methods the wife takes in preventing both her son and husband from leaving her.On the other hand there is a fear of becoming subsumed by the other and of losing touch with reality. This is reflected in the husband's determination to reason with her. He will not become subsumed by her grief, guilt, anxiety, lust or rage.It seems to end in some kind of sacrifice. Is she the sacrificial lamb; the repository of all the parts of himself that he cannot accept? Are the faceless women in the woods his internal projections of the so-called weaker sex; now free to roam unfettered in his psyche? However you chose to look at it, this film seems to highlight the problems faced at a social level when we rigidly adhere to polarized ideas about ourselves and about others. It touches upon notions of masculinity and femininity, good and evil, emotion and reason, sanity and insanity, love and hate.If you are someone who likes your film plots to be neatly sewn up and offered to you with a bow then do not watch this film. If you are comfortable with all shades of ambiguity then go ahead. You will love it and hate it both at the same time.",Antichrist
467,jason-evans-941-956462,"Horrific, but strangely compelling",8,4 January 2011,"To me this is an example of how to make a horror film. This is not a slasher movie, or even a supernatural horror film. But it is horrific in the true sense.I had no idea what to expect of it, I had heard that it was misogynistic and brutal, but had not heard why the reviewer(s) has formed this opinion. It shows how a real director can make a horror film without having to be stupid. It is a proper film, beautifully shot. It's compelling, making you stick with it because there is always the sense that all is not right.I really didn't expect to be so traumatised by it. I often think that horror films are best appreciated as an early teenager because I can remember being scared by Halloween, The Burning, I spit on your grave, Friday the 13th and the like as a 13 year old, sneakily watching ""Video Nasties"" around my friends house in the early 1980s. None of which have any had the same effect since being of a legal age to watch them. Maybe it is just films made for an American audience which are made for teenagers (on the whole)... For exampleNattevagten was horrific - the American remake ""Nightwatch"" wasn't Ringu was horrific - the American remake ""The Ring"" wasn't Honogurai mizu no soko kara - the American remake ""Dark Water"" wasn't and Funny Games... the original Austrian version was simply horrible, but when remade for the American market was simply lame.Antichrist is clearly aimed at an international market as it stars an American and is in the English language, but it is made in the style of a European film. Lars von Trier has not compromised, this is a proper horror film. The first half is heartbreaking and traumatising and the second half is just traumatising.I don't want to watch it again, but I am glad I watched it because it is a stunningly beautiful, horrifying and down right nasty piece of work.",Antichrist
468,obscenename001,An Experience,8,9 January 2011,"This is one of those movies that you have to wait until the next day when you are able to speak again. Just about the only movie I've ever watched that has given me the almost unquenchable urge to look away from the screen during but being vexed to the point where it becomes impossible to do so. The entirety of the film just makes you feel at odds with everything that is happening; reality seems to become a vortex and you're sucked into this world of anguish and fear. Nothing I can write can really do the film justice. The film is ultimately terrifying, not in the classical sense of course, but as a gilded look into humanity and fear. The fear not only of ourselves, often times throughout the film I felt as a detached fear (perhaps because of the grotesqueness of some aspects), but the innate fear of the characters and the entire experience of the human condition. I say the film can be grotesque, sure, but don't let that fact deter you from this piece. Nor let it entice you if you're into those Hostel or Saw type movies. No, no. It's nothing like those. It is as grotesque as it has to be to get its point across. No more, no less. There's nothing I can really say to do this film justice so I'll leave this with a recommendation. Do see this movie, by all means. It is an excellent film and and truly one of those films which could be defined as an experience. However, do not enter this film lightly. Be sure you are in the mood for a film that will entice you, make you question the core of the human experience, and, importantly, will make you pull at your hair in agony.",Antichrist

The movie made no sense. Even after reading what the movie was about it made no sense. Random insertions of gratuitous sex did not make the movie any better. I once believed that A Clockwork Orange was the worst movie ever made. It has now been replaced by Antichrist. With a budget of 11 million dollars I'll bet you that 5 million went into each of the actors bank accounts, 500,000 went into the college fund of the kid and the remaining 500,000 went into the pervasive drug habit of the producer.

There's more to it than just an original script, slow motion black and white detail captures your attention within the first 10 minutes of the movie.

471,freddiescott77,Visual Psychology,8,28 June 2011,"Upon watching this film I was instantly intrigued by the title. I am a sucker for a religious movie and though the description did not hint at any religious undertone, I figured the title would play itself out in whatever manner the director saw fit. In reviewing this film I opted to go the unconventional route and speak on elements of the movie rather than the plot or characters in particular. Now on to the movie itself.While I hate to agree with all of the other reviewers, this is really a love or hate type movie. Visually this movie is marvelous. The cinematography, the slow-motion usage, and the play on human emotion is like nothing that I have seen in recent years. Lars use of the psychological advantage that a director has over a viewer was masterful. Knowing that we are giving the movie our undivided attention, Lars attacks ever emotion and plays out the movie in imagery. This film could have almost been a silent film and still held a respectable level of potency.While William Dafoe was excellent in this film, it was the simplicity of the setting, the pragmatic wonderment, and use of lay upon layer of pain that gives this movie it's punch.This film does have some pretty gruesome scenes, but there is a certain level of poetic expression that accompanies each of these scenes; it is the beautiful train wreck that you almost want to force yourself to witness.The avant garde/indie feel of this movie will detract a lot of potential viewers, but if you can truly think outside of the box and position your mind in a place of unrelenting thoughts, lustful desires, pain driven action, and psychogenesis origins, you will most certainly enjoy this film.",Antichrist

You will notice very quickly the prominence of nudity and sex, but only because they are instruments that will ultimately drive the movie. I'm not crazy about the division of ""chapters,"" as they proceed in chronological order and don't seem necessary. The first two chapters focus on the couple dealing with grief, so a lot of crying and more sex. This is why you cannot be impatient...because the last two segments totally turn the movie on its head. Careful foreshadowing early on leads the movie into dark, and even terrifying terrain, ultimately crafting a haunting story that you will not be able to forget easily. The ending is gruesome and graphic, but if you are a lover of art and stories with a strong stomach, it will be worth it to watch.",Antichrist

This being the case, the script failed to carry the film.The director also failed to impose a moral, so the entire experience felt empty. I felt pity for the two leads, who were subjected to perform the scenes that they had to. Overall, from the initial premise of the story, a better screenplay could have been developed without the need to use any of the provocative scenes within the film.

This film recognizes, in a serious way, the depth and horror of violence inflicted on the body, as well as on the soul and the psyche. It is artful both in its technical execution, and its artistic analysis of its characters.Not for the faint of heart, certainlybut horror buffs should definitely take a look at this disturbing, yet profoundly effective film.",Antichrist
477,LaceMeUp_x,Antichrist in the UK,9,25 July 2009,"**NO MAJOR SPOILERS** So, after waiting for ages to see this film i got to see it on release day. It wasn't showing at my local cinemas so i had to travel to see it, which im glad i did.After studying media, i guess i did look at this movie differently than most of the audience. To be honest, the trailer really promotes this film as a horror, which i don't believe it is, not fully anyway. So there was quite afew people in the cinema expecting a hardcore horror film and most left calling it 'sh!t'. Problem was people were expecting a mainstream horror, not a independent style film that leaves u asking questions and making you think! I was surprised at how full the cinema was, afew people left before the 'extreme' parts began, and some left during. Afew people screamed at a particular scene with 'she'. No one laughed at the fox, i actually thought it was done quite well, i was expecting it to be like the goat from 'Drag me to hell' but it wasn't, thankfully! I didn't hate this film, it didn't disgust me, i didn't think it was an 'abomination'. I actually loved it, it made me think and wonder and it kept me interested all the way through. It was beautifully made and was extremely in-depth. It shows the side of human nature that is kept hidden although we all know its there, just some find it hard to face and it is pretty brave to do in a film.The sex scenes, were realistic and not just placed in the film for porn. Sex is natural, and just because this film shows it in a natural realistic form, doesn't mean it should be slated.I personally did not find the gore/violence/torture parts disturbing. Some parts did push boundaries but i don't see this as a bad thing. None of it was senseless and 'just' put in to disturbed the audience. Basically, all the sex/violence/gore were used because they were part of the plot and played a part in the film as it grew. Those who have seen this film will understand this as you notice how 'she's' mental health seriously deteriorates due to the loss of her child and her studies. I thought the director showed somewhat realistic affects of depression (i believe he was depressed at the time of producing this film). Thats not to say that depressed people go around being violent, the scenes before all that begins will show you what i mean by how hard n challenging the simplest things are to those depressed. You do really feel for 'she' at some points.You have to remember when watching this film, that the director wasn't in the best state of mind at the time of this film and so of course its going to be dark and every so slightly odd (lol), but i think this definitely make it a better film than it would of been if done by a director who hadnt experienced such deep problems.My advice if your wondering on whether to see it or not. Go for it, if your open minded and looking for a film that will definitely make you think and offers something different. Id describe it as a hybrid genre that mixes drama and horror well. If you are a huge animal lover, you might find some scenes hard to watch. I can completely understand why some people have found this so hard to watch. Just be prepared to see something 'different'.This film is extremely in-depth and will have you wondering and questioning what you've seen for days. 9/10.",Antichrist

The story wasn't quite that good, it was simple but still it had some twists, even though they were easy to recognize,those were pretty good. This is not the type of movie where all you want to know is the ending, the interesting aspect of the movie is all the development that leads to the end. That's where the movie starts to be something much more. The way that Von Trier shows the degradation of both Him and Her is so great. The directing of the movie is simply amazing, but still you got to like his style, otherwise it would seem like an endless and boring movie. Even though I've seen movies with much more symbolism and deep analysis, Antichrist bring something to our mind. A lot of movies try to make us feel as if we were the character but that's what I liked with the mix of story and directing, we could not really feel how Her was, except if you have seen your kid die in front of you ( which is pretty rare). He was showing to us the feeling and depression with a certain distance, we were watching someone die from the inside. Finally, I think that Antichrist deserve a 9, I'm still young, but I've seen a lot of movies, but I must say that this one had something that gripped me.

I really hate that. I don't think there is art in showing graphic violence, mutilation, etc. neither is horror in there. Just BAD TASTE.

It's just rubbish.I wanted to see a nice horror movie, - I'm not a big fan of pure horror movies, so I looked for a psychological horror. Lars von Trier is a big name and so I went for The Antichrist. The whole ""horror"" part is condensed in the last 30 minutes of the movie, with the genital mutilations. This isn't horror, this is only rock-bottom-splatter-hardcore-porn stuff.The movie ends with Gainsbourg being killed and burned by Dafoe, and he walking away from the woods when suddenly hundreds of women gather around him. What's the point? Right the Genocyde Thesis and ""the book of mental insanity"" held by Gainsbourg. This could be a very interesting point but hell no! von Trier prefers to spend 45 minutes filming them talking and making love.In the end, this movie isn't bad: it has a nice plot, a good cast - well, two actors, that's the whole cast - and a very nice photography, but it is badly developed. It looks like in the end the Director has to close it very quickly.2/10 for me. My suggestions: Guillermo del Toro's ""The Orphanage"" (7/10), ""Mama"" (9/10) and ""The Fawn's Labyrinth"" (8/10).

Compare it to Eyes Wide Shut.,2,25 September 2015,"I wanted to watch this movie because I read it was part of ""The Depression Trio"" films and Independent reviews claim it was, ""Shocking and Provoking"".Although this movie is done very artfully (graphically not poetically) and Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg act beautifully, this movie is boring for the bulk of it except when it climaxes in various parts with over-the-top genital graphic scenes, sex and gore.I felt this film tried hard to make you feel pain and sorrow, but it seemed silly and ridiculous that a Psychiatrist, played by Dafoe, would get so wrapped up in his wife's pain and vicious acts. This reminded me of Sid and Nancy except that couple was on drugs and uneducated. It was dark and believable, not like this film. Willem Defoe's character was indifferent, then a vulnerable victim. A highly educated person would not respond this way. I'm not sure if that was the point, but I didn't feel sorrow or see how the changes that the film tries to portray in human emotions after the death of their son made any sense at all. The woman some sense, the man, not at all. As soon as it was over, I thought, ""That was stupid"". The only other time I've been disappointed by the hype of a 'provoking' movie was ""Eyes Wide Shut"". That movie also tries to force you to feel something or think something with a story line that makes no sense and goes in weird directions and ends with a somewhat predictable climax and wants to leave you feeling something deep, but really you just feel like, ""What a waste of time"".There are several other movies I think are much better: ""Heavenly Creatures"", ""Black Swan"", ""Streets"", ""Traffic"", ""Crash"", and ""Sid and Nancy""My recommendation is: If you were disappointed with ""Eyes Wide Shut"", this movie is more graphic and gory like ""Hostel"", except it involves the death of a child; but, you will still be disappointed after the movie is over. If you like ""Eyes Wide Shut"", felt it moved you to think and don't mind explicit genital bleeding, gore, and over-the-top makes a better film, you may like it.I give it 2 since it was artful looking like ""Matrix"" and has good acting, but without special effects and the actors subjecting themselves to graphic scenes, the movie is absolutely a 1 based on no sense, slow and boring, and tries to force you into something with over-the-top scenes instead of compelling emotion.",Antichrist

Divided in a prologue (a pure work of art, beautifully framed in black and white slow motion) and four chapters, Grief, Pain, Despair and The Three Beggars, this film leaves no room to breathe, since its very beginning the movie hit the viewer hard and painfully and at the same time it's like impossible to stop viewing since the way it has been made is an astonishing work of art, a masterpiece. Realizing that von Trier also wrote this movie, makes you think ""what the hell's going on in his mind?"". Apart from the initial 20 minutes the movie is only based on 2 characters (Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg) and their descent into hell. Full of beautiful images and eerie landscapes which recall Andrei Tarkovsky's masterpiece Stalker (the movie is actually dedicated to Tarkovsky). The main soundtrack theme (Lascia ch'io pianga from Handel's opera Rinaldo) marvelously match the images and contribute to bring you into this nightmarish journey into the most unimaginable destination, Antichrist breaks any barriers and overpass any boundaries, this movie shows something never seen before in cinema, it will stay with you for long time, this is disturbing cinema at its very best but this is also an amazing work of art/cinema. A truly shocker. Vote: 8/10",Antichrist
492,iswearimnotafangirl,An actual pap smear is more pleasant than watching this.,1,14 May 2016,"Hopefully this review saves some folks from unneeded wasting of their time. In short, I was literally uncomfortable from start to finish of this whole movie. The end of it caused relief, relief that this snuff film was over. Honestly, I fail to see what's actually artistic about this gore porn fest for the sake of just being gore porn. Spoilers ahead, if anything can really spoil what's an atrocious waste of what felt like 6 hours of discomfort. A psychologist attempts to give his wife therapy after severely suffering from them losing their son by him step out of an open window while they're making love. First of all, I don't think any parent in their right mind would actually commit such deplorable negligence, even in the most passionate of love-making. Second of all, why does the grieving mother use sex as basically a drug to deal with her grief? Third, any self respecting psychologist would know you don't treat your own spouse, certainly not the cold, detached way portrayed in this movie. Fourth, I saw nothing special in the herky jerky camera pans and awkward sudden camera spasms while changing angles. It makes the movie seem downright pretentious. I guess the movie could be interpreted as dealing with grief and the darker parts of the human condition? The way the 6 separate chapters, acts, whatever they were, really screws up the pacing of the movie. It seems to also show the smattering of disturbing images just for shock value. In one of the later chapters, the movie tries to explain maybe the mother's start into a very dark psychic place, not even sure if that's even what Von Trier was trying to do. Fair warning, if I'm interpreting this senselessly obscene movie correctly, the director seems to have a misogynistic attitude toward women. The husband discovers disturbing material and images that the wife came up with. To me, it seems this part of it symbolizes women being evil creatures, or maybe believing they are evil. Again, I fail to see exactly what Von Trier was even trying to make a statement about, most of this review is speculation. Put it this way, I am hesitant to see any other Von Trier movies after seeing this. When I say the film made me uncomfortable from start to finish, I'm not exaggerating. Just a sample of the grotesque imagery: a doe with a dead fetus hanging out of its birth canal, a fox eating itself, the wife cutting off her own cl**toris, also stimulation of the husband to ejaculation of blood, the husband's testicles getting smashed; just to name a few. Not to mention the extremely irritating pitch of the wife's voice as she chases her husband through the woods while he tries to escape her after putting him through intense pain after unexplained sadistic and erratic behavior. It's never clear to me why she decided to brutalize her husband, considering he was trying to help her work through her grief. At some point, she claims to be ""cured"" of her grief, yet keeps spiraling into a state of indescribable psychosis. The end is baffling as well: a bunch of spirits of women walking through the woods after he kills the crazed wife. Still scratching my head on the point of this part. I doubt it's spirits of women who died there, seeing as the entire movie centers around the grieving husband and wife. You don't even learn the character's names, which to me is poor character development, as I had no way of identifying, or even caring about the character's struggles throughout the movie. If anything, the characters seem detached, cold, numb, and apathetic, especially Willem Dafoe's character. If this movie was going for unnecessary shock value, it succeeded. If it was going for artsy, I personally believe it fell short of anything resembling art. If it was trying to make the viewer wishing they washed their eyes out with bleach after seeing the film, (I wish I was exaggerating) it succeeded. (No joke, my first text after watching this movie was to my brother saying I wanted to wash my eyes out with bleach. All in all, the movie seemed to be trying to be shocking just for the sake of being shocking. I'm happy to say I didn't pay money to see this, seeing as it's on Netflix. I feel bad for anyone who did spend money to see it. All in all, a pitiful excuse for a film. I've had more pleasant times having routine pap smears. If you're not faint of heart or stomach, maybe you'd enjoy this movie. Also, spoiler alert, this movie had nothing to do with the Antichrist, unless grief itself is portrayed to be the Antichrist. A pointless movie, if you like gore porn, go see the Saw movies or Ichi the Killer. Don't waste your time on this abhorrent piece of trash.",Antichrist
493,lxkozicki,It never got good,1,14 September 2016,"I've never rated a movie before, but I had to after seeing this, basically nothing happens for 2 hrs, wasn't scary just boring. I'm no art critic so I can't really speak for that aspect of the movie, but I would say nah it wasn't art either. The plot was terrible and the movie was too long. After seeing it I felt like 2 hrs of my life had been taken from me and I want them back! I respect Willem Dafoe and his acting in the movie was convincing and dedicated but when it all comes down to it the movie just never got good. The entire film I was waiting for something to happen and it never did. There was no reason for the movie to be called Antichrist since that had pretty much nothing to do with the movie.",Antichrist
494,lamonzon-20651,Loathed It!,1,21 April 2017,"I watched the film, and wondered why I was so miserable during the entire thing. Lars von Trier is not an artist - he's a sadist, and I know plenty of Danes who hate him. He is a poseur, who has embraced fascism and cruelty. It seems his sole purpose is to humiliate his actors, and really, his work is mediocre. He relies on shock value, using well known and generally talented actors - it adds to the ""oh my god!"" factor. He really should be walked off a cliff, but if you like watching people have their dignity removed in a manner utterly lacking in subtlety - Lars is your guy. Watch this film if you want, but honestly? I wouldn't waste my time; that's two hours I'll never get back.",Antichrist

497,jules-222,Shame Lars went for the Big Names,8,11 September 2017,"Other reviewers have said it all, both good and bad. I didn't realise what a truly superb piece of work it was until a period of ""digestion"" afterwards. The remark I really want to make, however, is that, having watched a lot of the bonus material on the DVD (nightshift on an oil rig, with nothing better to do), I consider it a shame that the actors in the test shooting were not given the roles for the movie itself. Their names are Jens Albinus and Mille Lehfeldt, and they were strikingly fresh, intelligent, and somehow seemed to project an honesty that escaped Willem & Charlotte. I realise there are business factors at play; the film had to be financed and it had to reach an audience. Poor Lars; Dogme days are over...",Antichrist
498,mads_nyeland,"Eerie, artful and provoking",9,9 June 2009,"I had to watch this movie shortly after all the hype and the angry responses died down. I haven't seen all of Von Triers movies, but i've seen enough to confirm that you won't know what to expect. It made an impression on me for sure. Obviously the female circumcision stands out as a shocking and insane moment. One shouldn't let it overshadow the rest of the movie though as it is quite interesting. Just look away for three seconds if you can't handle it. The beginning of the movie is so unusual that you are never really sure what's going to happen next. As the couple get to the cabin in the woods things start to get spooky though. As they try to work out the womans grief, she becomes more and more irrational. Sometimes showing a side to her which makes you question her real intentions and her sanity. Later we find out that she is in fact quite insane in a plot twist reminding me of the ""The Shining""... Half way through things get so distorted that you feel like you are going crazy yourself. Von Trier uses a few techniques here though shocking sound effects are noticeably absent. Whether the supernatural imagery is a reflection of the woman's mind state or whether it instills a more profound, philosophical meaning i can't really say, simply because i don't know. I will repeat the statement though that something in the movie takes me back to the mind state of Jack Torrance in ""The Shining"". The woman was working on a thesis in the cabin a while back about the systematic killing of women in medieval times because of their ""inhabited"" evilness. Perhabs it's the content of that thesis which shapes the movie and ultimately leads to the woman's schizophrenia. But then again, i don't know if this idea computes with the very strange ending of the movie. All in all i'm a bit confused, but i do know that it's entertaining,weird and thought provoking. Maybe i'll understand the symbolism later on. If you are easily offended you should stay far away from this one. I think it should be seen as a gem for movie-buffs more than anything. Angry off-topic note: The journalists who surrounded the director after the showing should have asked questions about the plot and the ideas in the movie instead of demanding an apology for it. It wasn't fair cause after watching it i really find it to be an interesting and bold piece of art. They should feel happy diversity still exists in the industry, instead of bashing those who stretch the boundaries of film-making.",Antichrist
