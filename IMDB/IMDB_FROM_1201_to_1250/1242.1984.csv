0,TheLittleSongbird,A classic complicated book is made into a equally complex and disturbing film!,9,19 May 2009,"Everything about this movie felt so real, the cinematography, the outstanding music, the acting, the entire look of the film. John Hurt is perfectly cast as Winston Smith. If you want more of this talented man's work, try the Elephant Man, Watership Down, The Black Cauldron and Lord of the Rings(the animation)Richard Burton was wonderful as the sinister O'Brien, and their scene in Room 101 was the highlight of the film, and is also the best bit of the book. The Room 101 scene is very disturbing, and sees Winston as a broken man, people O'Brien pulls out Winston's tooth here, the sound that made disturbed me greatly. The cinematography was excellent, with the graphic darkness and the pastoral imagery. Susanna Hamilton is also good as Julia, though the sex scene in the woods was a little too much information, everyone in my year 11 English class, i was 16 when I first saw this, covered their eyes when Julia stripped naked. However, this is very faithful to the source material, well it may need to be to convey the terror of living in an omnipotent society. All in all, a powerful and effective film, based on a complicated but truly excellent book. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",1984
1,bkoganbing,Maybe 2084,5,19 July 2015,"It's 1984 and George Orwell's vision of the future hasn't quite arrived yet. Maybe Orwell should have been slightly more optimistic and named his futuristic pessimistic novel 2084.In any event the world is now in three different conglomerate countries and John Hurt as our protagonist Winston Smith is in the country of Oceania. It's all one continual war as Oceania is forever fighting with one or both the other two and sometimes one of the other two is in alliance. All we know is what the Faux News tells us. One thing is constant, you've got to keep up the martial spirit of the citizenry to hate the designated enemy at the moment.John Hurt has a nice bureaucratic job, but he's starting to question just what is being given out for news and a whole lot more about certain assumptions this totalitarian society is based on. He's even taken to fornicating for the pleasure of it, specifically with Suzanna Hamilton. They've even set up a love nest of sorts.But you can't keep away from the all seeing eye of Big Brother. And soon both of them are being rehabilitated by the State of Oceania.The state here is represented by Richard Burton who was ill at the time and gives an almost somnambulant performance. I suspect health was the reason. John Hurt however is fine as Winston Smith and he's a fine everyman protagonist for a very frightening future.",1984
2,SnoopyStyle,Good bleak dystopian world,6,16 September 2014,It's 1984 and the world is divided into 3 totalitarian competing superstates. Winston Smith (John Hurt) lives in a crumbling London in Oceania. He is a simple party worker in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth. His job is to alter and sanitize records of the past. Everybody is under the constant surveillance of the Thought Police. Winston keeps a diary and encounters undeniable proof of official lies. He is in essence a thought-criminal. He begins an illicit affair with Julia (Suzanna Hamilton) who on the surface belongs to the fanatical Anti-Sex League. Then he meets a member of the Inner Party O'Brien (Richard Burton) who might be part of the resistance.This movie presents a good representation of the bleak Orwellian dystopia. John Hurt is rather lifeless as Winston which is what the character is suppose to be. However I wanted more for the movie. It is a little too bleak. The movie needs to hold out the promise of humanity and then snatch it away. It never truly holds out hope for something better. A better use of the dystopian world is the 1985 movie Brazil. This is a little too monotone although it is a good visual look. Even the torture is a little too slow. I love the rats but there is too much explaining. The excessive dialog drowns out the truly compelling parts of the torture. This is interesting but not that exciting.,1984
3,Hitchcoc,Sometimes Over the Top,9,6 February 2020,"This is an extremely painful film to watch. Of course, the novel makes it so. John Hurt does an excellent job, playing Winston Smith, who works for the government (who doesn't?). He is depressed and has the darkness in his soul of hopelessness. When he find a way out (or so he thinks) he falls in love and they have at least some respite from the tedium. But Richard Burton's character knows how to break people and get them back from their prodigal behavior. I don't know if every moviegoer knew the story going it, but it is certainly a bit of an ordeal watching it, especially the second half. This is much more graphic than its predecessor, but both of them are excellent films.",1984
4,claudio_carvalho,"Who Controls the Past Controls the Future, Who Controls the Present Controls the Past",10,24 November 2010,"In 1984, Oceania is an omnipresent state ruled by the Big Brother with a totalitarian society and in permanent war, presently against Eurasia, with intention of keeping the proletariat without education and without possibility of capital accumulation. People from the upper classes follow the ""Ingsoc"" philosophy and are under permanent surveillance of Big Brother through the ""telescreen"" – a monitor that is television and also spies the life of each individual. However, the proletariat is free of the control of the state. The Party has just released the 10th edition of the Newspeak Dictionary, with the intention of reducing the words to make people limited to express any feeling against the Party. In the ""Minitrue"" (Ministry of Truth in Newspeak), the bureaucrat Winston Smith (John Hurt) rewrites history to permit the party to control the future and is quite indifferent to his society. Winston is approached by the party member O'Brien (Richard Burton) that gives a copy of the new released dictionary to him. When Winston meets the brother Julia (Suzanna Hamilton), they commit ""sexcrime"" and fall in love for each other. But they are captured by the fearful Thought Police and Winston is interrogated and brainwashed by O'Brien that explains the logic of the party to keep the power. But in the end, the human spirit of Winston prevails. When I was a teenager, George Orwell's ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" and ""Animal Farm"" and Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"" were my favorite novels. George Orwell wrote this novel in 1948, inverting the last two digits in the title, and the novel was released on 8 June 1949. The story takes place between April and June 1984. I read the book in Portuguese, where the new words of the Newspeak were perfectly translated.The film ""1984"" is a magnificent transposition of the novel to the cinema, with a remarkable screenplay by Michael Radford and top-notches performances of John Hurt and Richard Burton in his last work. The awesome direction of Michael Radford gives a perfect idea of this novel about a dystopian society and the political theories of this society subdue by the powerful, feared and omnipresent Big Brother and is so careful that ""1984"" was filmed between April and June 1984 in London, in the same period and location George Orwell wrote in his novel. I saw this depressing film in the movie theater for the first time in 1984, and since then, I have seen at least three times on VHS (last time on 24 April 2003) and now I have just watched on DVD. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""1984""",1984
5,ma-cortes,George Orwell's novel of a totalitarian future society in which a man whose daily work is rewriting history tries to rebel by falling in love.,7,13 August 2013,"Michael Radford's film adaptation of classic dystopian novel. George Orwell's terrifying vision comes to life . Exciting rendition that picks up every mote of bleak despair George Orwell's novel of a totalitarian future society in which a man whose daily work is rewriting history tries to rebel by falling in love . The film's opening prologue states: ""Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past"" . In a futuristic, state-run society controlled by ""Big Brother"" in which love is outlawed, employee of the state Winston Smith (John Hurt) falls for Julia (Suzanne Hamilton) , and is tortured and brainwashed for his crime . As a man who works for 'The Party' , an all powerful empire led by a man known only as 'Big Brother', begins to have thoughts of rebellion and love for a fellow member . Together they look to help bring down the party .Dystopian polemic story which contain a polemic denounce to totalitarianism. ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" is a workmanlike rendition of notorious novel that captures the desolation and misery found within those pages , though some liberties have been taken with the script . The film was made and released about thirty-five years after its source novel of the same name by George Orwell had been first published in 1948. Orwell chose the title of his magnum opus ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" by inverting the last two digits of the year he completed the manuscript (1948). George also wrote ¨Animal Farm¨ , a barely-disguised metaphor for Stalin's propaganda-laced Soviet Russia, as well as his later novel 1984. This is one of a number of dystopian, Orwellian and Kafaesque films made during the early to mid 1980s , the pictures include 1984, Terry Gilliam's Brazil, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner , Pink Floyd The Wall , Season of the Witch and Giorgio Moroder version of Fritz Lang's Metrópolis .Very acting by John Hurt as the tragic figure who dares to fall in love within a totalitarian society where emotions are outlawed and Suzanne Hamilton ,she was perfectly cast as Julia , her uncommonly bold, affecting performance, earned her some notoriety and a bit of a minor cult and she is frequently seen in full-frontal nudity . And , of course , Richard Burton , in his last film role makes a grand torturer : cold , shrewd and stiff , in fact the picture is dedicated to actor Richard Burton ; the dedication during the closing credits states: ""With love and admiration, Richard Burton 1925-1984"" . Director Michael Radford and cinematographer Roger Deakins originally wanted to shoot the film in black and white, but the financial backers of the production, Virgin Films, opposed this idea. Instead Deakins used a film processing technique called bleach bypass to create the distinctive washed-out look of the film's color visuals . Impressive as well as evocative production design has been rendered with meticulous attention to period detail . The picture won the ""Best British Film of the Year"" award at the Evening Standard British Film Awards in 1984. However , the movie achieved mediocre box office , but following over the years as the film's reputation has steadily grown.Other adaptations about this classic novel are the followings : ¨1984¨ (1956) by Michael Anderson with Edmond O'Brien as Winston Smith , Michael Redgrave as O'Connor of the Inner Party , Jan Sterling as Julia of the Inner Party , Mervyn Johns as Jones and Donald Pleasence as R. Parsons . And for TV ¨1984¨(1954) by by Rudolph Cartier with Peter Cushing as Winston Smith , André Morell as O'Brien as Yvonne Mitchell as Julia and again Donald Pleasence as Syme . Furthermore, an American version , Studio one . ¨1984¨ , (1953) with Eddie Albert as Winston Smith , Lorne Greene as O'Brien and Norma Crane as Julia .",1984
6,Quinoa1984,"Radford, Deakins and Hurt deliver an astonishing film adaptation that gives extra resonance to the book",10,4 April 2017,"""Power is tearing human minds apart and putting them back together in new shapes of your own choosing."" I think it's easy enough to say that the book by Orwell of 1984 is still valuable because, simply, it is, from the quote above to many, many others, its a cultural touchstone - though there's two things that may be taken for granted: first, that the film itself gets to the dark, horror-movie tone of paranoia and grime and decay and moral impoverishment (and the desperate search for it) that was in the book, and secondly that for all of the lines that people quote, people may not fully grasp how much emotion is conveyed in this story, that when one looks at the *people* there's so much to mine there. This is actually what makes the book so great, and the film too, though it's one of 'those' great films I'm not sure when I'd have the heart to watch again (Brazil, a massively looser version, is more-so but then thats a comedy in a lot of ways, but I digress).What I think Radford does so well along with Roger Deakins's soaked-in-a-dirty-rag cinematography (which I mean as a sincere compliment) is get us into this world and it's one of oppression, devastation, and totalitarian control and keeps us there, so that when it comes time to see the ""green world"" of that landscape with the trees and those hills, it's more impactful and more like Winston (and us by proxy) being exposed to what is closest to... art, to beauty.When I say emotions, I mean that it's in the actors conveying it - Hurt (who I miss all the more now seeing this a few months after his passing), Suzanne Hamilton to an extent, and in his way how Burton is so completely and wholly wound tight (is it the same as restrained, I'm not sure) - but it's also in key moments that Radford gets right. It's one thing to get the full weight of the terror that Winston feels when he's strapped to the table in the last third and things get rougher and harder to watch than before (Hurt sells it especially, but it's Burton with his cold demeanor that sells it furthest of all, we know he's done this countless times before and will do it again), or those little moments between Hurt and Hamilton when in bed together, naked and open to each other, and how their 'love' is stifled/compromised to a large extent by how they were raised and the world they're in. But there's more.Take the woman who lives below Winston was an extraordinary touch, and it's something that got me thinking after the movie ended (as it did in the book, but this is something that a movie could and does do better): Winston observes that it's so out there to think that a song that was made up by a machine could be performed by this woman so beautifully. In just that there's the capacity to see how someone lost in their seeming day-to-day affairs, can bring artistic depth and expression and feeling. While Radford and Deakins don't show her too close-up, that's fine: we know how Smith reacts to it (and maybe Julia, though perhaps her connection to her comes too late, if (spoiler) it's real at all), and that's what counts. Or to another example, the other man who Smith briefly talks to about lending razors who shows up when Winston is imprisoned - what did he do exactly? All that matters is he is there and fingers Smith. But, again, the actor is fully organic in this world.If I could nitpick (or maybe it's a legit criticism, I may feel different about the movie later on or even tomorrow), I wondered if there could have been *more* Big Brother imagery - we get that one face in the screen looking on, and then the woman's voice, coming in like the rancid school-marm, on the intercom. But there were a scene or two I wondered if there would be more cameras watching things, or if it was only on the TV screens. Again, a nitpick, since the message is still conveyed and the more important aspect of Big Brother and it's control of society is shown by Radford and company: language and the control of it. This is the part, along with critical thinking in society, that remains relevant as when Orwell wrote it in 1948 as it did in 84 when the film was made and today in 2017 when now Orwell gets quoted this way and that on Twitter and Facebook (but of course the *quotable* bits, I'm not sure how many would want to mention the bit about the rats much).The tricky thing with the film adaptation of this was to make it either *too* oppressive in its drama and horror, which it almost goes to, or trying to soften it or veering too much into satire. There is inherent satire in the text - Orwell constantly did that as a writer and thinker - but one needs to take this as a work as if it's happening as we see it. The remarkable thing and power of the film is that it simply works as a film unto itself, showing us through the power of cinematic grammar, dream-like imagery and occasionally in the cutting, and performance and music (hey Eurythmics, that's some atmospheric s*** right there), that this story not only retains its intellectual power but it gains a little in the pathos department. And that final scene in the cafe.... damn.",1984
7,Theo Robertson,A Directorial Success But Not A Narrative One,6,29 July 2010,"George Orwell's 1984 is one of the most celebrated novels of the 20th Century . We have words like "" Orwellian "" that have come in to everyday modern usage . Indeed there's at least two television shows BIG BROTHER and ROOM 101 who take their concepts from 1984 . It seems logical that if someone was going to make a film adaptation of the novel then 1984 would be the perfect year to release it . Unfortunately Michael Radford's interpretation of Orwell is an irritating clash between the good and the bad Radford's visuals are superb and the tone sets the dark , gloomy , downbeat feel of the novel perfectly . Orwell used Stalin's Soviet Union for much of the novel's inspiration as well as 1940s Britain . The film's set design is drab and retro and full of urban decay and squalor that Ingsoc has brought to Airstrip One , you can almost smell the rats and rubble and exploding rocket bombs . All this is helped in no small part by Roger Deakins bleak cinematography . Radford also makes good use of the newscreens giving war reports on the crusade against Eurasia . Even the much criticised soundtrack by the Eurythmics seem perfectly suited to the film . John Hurt seems born to play the role of Winston Smith the middle aged hero of the novel . Unfortunately Hurt isn't given enough material to make the role as memorable as the one played by Peter Cushing in the 1954 BBC version because Radford the screenwriter is no Nigel Kneale . The problem with the film is the storytelling Many people would consider the novel unfilmable . Nigel Kneale managed to carry it off 30 years earlier but Kneale was something of a genius where scriptwriting was concerned . Radford isn't . From the opening scene we see Winston , Julia and O'Brien at the public hate meeting . However both Julie and O'Brien are then quickly forgotten until much later in the film . The screenplay really does meander greatly at some points giving us flashbacks to Winston visiting a prostitute and Winston as a child . What's to do with the plot ? Nothing absolutely nothing but seem to be included for some reason known only to he editor . Likewise Winston proclaims to Julia that he loves corruption and wants the whole world to be corrupt . What's his motivation for this ? he's done nothing on screen that suggests he believes this . Perhaps the editor has taken out an important scene whilst keeping meaningless ones ? Strangely for a film containing so much full frontal nudity it seems strange that the classic line "" You're only a rebel from the waist down "" is missing Certainly the scenes in Room 101 could have done with a bit of trimming . Unfortunately those of us who saw the 1954 BBC version will be disappointed by it . The scene with Andre Morrell as O Brien giving a soliloquy on the aims and method of the party is a piece of unforgettable television . There's nothing really wrong with Richard Burton in the same role as such but probably needed a proper introductory scene in order to make the character work properly . If you've no knowledge of the novel you might have a problem knowing who his character is supposed to be In short this is a slightly disappointing film version of a legendary novel written by one of the 20th Century's most important figures . Certainly it can't be faulted by the visual look which is highly impressive but unless you've read the book you'll probably be confused and bored long before the final scene . Despite the very low production values I was utterly transfixed by Rudolph Cartier/ Nigel Kneale's BBC version which sadly wasn't the case here",1984
8,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Great idea almost entirely ruined by lackluster direction,6,23 December 2004,"I haven't read the book by George Orwell or seen any of the other film adaptations of it, so I can't comment on how accurate this is compared to any other version. I've heard it's quite accurate, though. Just about anyone who've read the book has praised it as a terrifying masterpiece about a totalitarian government. That, coupled with John Hurt being in the lead role, convinced me to see this film. I was quite excited to see if it lived up to its reputation. Unfortunately, almost all of the great promise of an excellent idea is ruined by the poor direction and unimaginative cinematography. The film never manages to capture or maintain the viewers interest for more than a few minutes through the entire film. The plot is good, but it moves so slowly that there are times when it doesn't seem to be moving at all. The acting ranges but is mostly unimpressive. John Hurt gives a good performance, but that's about it. The characters are well-written and credible, but I suppose that is because Orwell rather than any of the film-makers. I could be wrong, but that's the one thing(coupled with the plot/theme, which is Orwell's work as well) that isn't tame and mediocre. The cinematography is dull and daft. No new or even slightly original angles, pans or cuts. All tongue-in-cheek, old, standard stuff as far as camera-work and editing goes. The film is visually uninteresting and the plot moves too slow for it to be saved on that front. I really found nothing of interest in this film that isn't most likely done, and much better so, in the book, which I've heard is supposed to be far more captivating. It can hardly be worse, that's for sure. Just to put into perspective exactly how boring this is; I saw the horror film The Dentist yesterday, a movie most write off as pointless and forgettable. I sat through the entirety of that film, and I still remember quite a bit of it. I frequently left the room(with the film still running) during this film, and I don't really remember any of it, even though it ended not long ago. This film could have been great, in the hands of far superior film-makers such as Terry Gilliam and Stanley Kubrick... too bad it was ruined by a talentless no-name director. I don't really recommend this film to anyone, since the book appears to be much, much better. 6/10",1984
9,view_and_review,"My Thoughts on 1984, and They're not a Crime",7,7 January 2020,"It's been a while since I read the book 1984. It's been less time since I saw the 1956 version of 1984. The book is a classic, the 1956 movie was good. But, it's only right that the book 1984 be made into a movie in 1984.Director Michael Radford did a spectacular job capturing the dreary somber mood of the book. The movie seemed perpetually dark--not like nightfall, but as though there were a haze over everything. There was no color, even in the clothes, everything was drab.The pacing of the movie matched the mood--it was lethargic and lacking in energy. The only time emotion was on display was during the ""two minutes hate"" in which party members worked themselves up into a frenzy in hatred of whatever the party decided deserved hatred. Besides those moments the entire tone was muted. Even the ""passion"" and ""love"" between Winston Smith (John Hurt) and Julia (Suzanna Hamilton) was tempered as though they didn't know what real passion and love was.1984 is a book that is difficult to capture cinematically. It is excellent as a book, but I don't think it translates as well as a movie. 1984 was a decent movie, though I still don't think it did justice to the book.",1984
10,The_Void,Cold and lifeless vision of the future,6,27 July 2008,"I have to admit that I've not read George Orwell's original novel '1984'; but everyone knows the story and many elements of it have made their way into popular culture. Since I've not read the book; I can't comment on whether or not this film version is faithful to the literature, but apparently this is one of the more faithful movie versions. Director Michael Radford takes the subject material and uses it to paint an incredibly bleak vision of the future; one so bleak that all the warmth of the movie is thoroughly drained from it and we are left with is incredibly lifeless and hard to get on with. Our main character is a man named Smith. Smith works in a people intensive environment where he is charged with the task of rewriting history. This future society has been divided into three parts; and we focus on Oceania, of which London is the capital. The state is ruled over by 'Big Brother' and thinking outside of the box is against the law. Smith falls in love with a woman named Julia; which is of course against the rules of the totalitarian society.The movie takes more time instilling the situation of the future than it does on the actual characters; so while we get a chilling portrait of how this modern society is ran and the rules that govern it; we are unfortunately not given much in the way of reasons to care about our main characters' plights. The story itself has some very interesting points to make, however; and depending on your stance, you may well believe that modern society is moving ever closer to the 'Big Brother' of this film; here in the UK we are already being threatened with the prospect of ID cards, security cameras and ISP's spying on our internet connections, so maybe Orwell's vision is not such a distant possibility. Going back to the film; it does have to be said that it is well made. The acting is generally very good and the cinematography very much fits the style and atmosphere that the story demands. Some say that this film is terrifying; though the disengagement from the lead characters made it less so for me, and this is definitely the main problem. I haven't seen any other versions of this story, however (unless Brazil counts) and while I'm not overly fussed with this film; it is at least worth a look.",1984
11,Sylviastel,The only film version available!,8,4 February 2007,"George Orwell may have been a literary genius or a raving lunatic or both. This film version is dreary but so is life in the world of 1984 where everybody is watched, reported, and kept to a standard based on what higher powers think we should be. Winston Smith is an unlikely hero. He hates rats. He is working at making speech and language limited slowly by slowly. He hates his job. He falls in love but it's dangerous in a world where love is frowned upon. War is favored instead of love and hatred is preferred over romance. The world is a miserable existence for those like Winston who seeks to escape his mind from the controls of others. Orwell may have approved of this film version. I don't know because he died before it was even filmed. It's rather the last film and it was dedicated to Richard Burton CBE (he wasn't knighted) but should have been. He died after filming this movie. John Hurt CBE is a brilliant under-rated actor. This film version was used by me and many who were to read the novel for school.",1984
12,mm-39,"Well made movie, but not for entertainment!",6,5 September 2003,"Well made movie, that has a message; not an entertaining message, but one of bleakness.  I have to read nine books for my college lit course, and this is movie 3.  Much better than the 'The Others' but less entertaining than 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead'.  What I like is the portrayal of a repressive government, and how a government lies can be truth if that is how they become perceived.  How much does the media, and government manipulate the truth is what I gain from this film.  Being a literature classic some of the film is dry, and complex.  I believe this film is a crisism of communism and the super state.  Where the elimination of the family, and all other loyalties must be repressed.  In the end, whenever I hear something is for the greater good watch out.  6/10",1984
13,SimonJack,An Orwellian future existence sapped of any humanity,8,4 September 2021,"George Orwell's novel, ""1984"", is a timeless classic and as much a warning to people in the 21st century and beyond as it was in the mid-20th century. This movie, made in the precise time and setting of Orwell's 1949 novel, follows the book very closely. Where the 1956 movie based on the novel was greatly tamed down and revised, this British film is faithful to the story in all its extremes of oppression, torture, and ugliness. But, it also includes excessive scenes of nudity that the book just describes in words and then moves on. The visual scenes of full frontal female nudity will likely distract some audiences from the depth and seriousness of Orwell's warning.Over his relatively short life span, Orwell wrote some powerful books with great stories of social commentary. He was strongly anti-Nazi and, although preferring a form of democratic socialism, he was also strongly anti-communist. His first of the two great social classics, ""Animal Farm,"" was a 1944 fable that he based on the Russian Revolution of 1917. I had always wondered about Orwell's choice of the various animals to represent certain people, especially the pigs to be the leaders of the animal revolt against the humans. Old Major, Squealer and the other head pigs where characterizations of Marx, Lenin and Josef Stalin. Then, in 1949, Orwell capped his social commentary with the dire warnings about totalitarianism, in ""1984."" He died the next year of tuberculosis, at age 49This is a story about the oppression, mind and thought control of totalitarian regimes. It's about the demoralization processes, and elimination of all morality and purpose except to the state. The state is and becomes the god of all the people - in the personage of Big Brother. There are no freedoms. Under the guise of love, the people are controlled and aroused to hatred for their enemies. The world has been divided into three such totalitarian states that are constantly at war with one another. This is the sequel to ""Animal Farm,"" which began with lies, the manipulation of language, and distortions. Eventually, within the animal kingdom (read, humanity today), what has been good in the past is now called bad and evil; and what was evil or bad is now good.The advanced stage of totalitarianism in ""1984"" now has people revising history. The prologue on the screen sets the stage and describes the mantra of Orwell's book: ""Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.""All of the cast in this film are very good. John Hurt is superb in portraying the hero, Winston Smith, with his various experiences. It's eerie how his facial expression changes so little regardless of the emotions or any physical or mental things he may be experiencing. That conveys the emptiness, the mindlessness, the nothingness of the state of total control and oppression that one otherwise can only Imagine. Richard Burton's O'Brien is a picture of the mindless minion of Big Brother whose job it is to tell Hurt's Winston why he must change as he goes about torturing him and leading him to such change. Burton himself would not see the finished movie. He died more than two months before its release, on Oct. 5, 1984, of a cerebral hemorrhage at age 58.But for the prominent nudity in places, this would be a movie that all people, from their middle teens, should see. As it is, it is most suitable only for very mature adults. Ironically, that's also the group or audience that is the least in need of being educated or better informed about the dangers of totalitarianism today.Orwell's poignant assessment of the history of mankind seems prophetic as well as alarming. Society at any time should take it to heart. ""Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.""",1984
14,JamesHitchcock,A Fitting End to Richard Burton's Career,8,3 September 2010,"In the year 1984, when I was a college student, there was much discussion of George Orwell's famous novel, generally concentrating on how far his predictions had come true since he wrote it in 1948. Some felt that he had got everything right except the sex of the supreme dictator and that the country was now being run by Big Sister (by which they meant Margaret Thatcher) rather than Big Brother. Others claimed that the novel could be read as a prediction of developments in post- Stalin Russia and post-Mao China where the apparatus of state repression was now being used to defend not the Revolution but the power, status and privileges of the Soviet nomenklatura and its Chinese equivalent. All agreed that Orwell had been prescient in predicting the division of the world into three power blocs, his Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia corresponding roughly to NATO, the Warsaw Pact and Red China. It was perhaps therefore inevitable that the novel would be filmed in that year. (It had earlier been adapted for television and the cinema in the fifties). There was, however, perhaps a problem. Orwell was not a particularly visual writer; he dealt in words more than pictures, and several phrases coined in the book have passed into our language. (""Newspeak"", ""thoughtcrime"", ""doublethink"", ""Thought Police"", ""telescreen"", ""Room 101"", ""Big Brother"", etc.). It is notable that many of these words refer either to speech or to thought, and in fact ""Nineteen Eighty Four"" is more than just a satire on totalitarianism; it is also an exploration of various philosophical, political and linguistic issues. These are difficult concepts to convey in cinematic form, and the director Michael Radford wisely concentrates more on the anti- totalitarian aspects of the story. Radford and cinematographer Roger Deakins originally wanted to shoot the film in black-and-white, which would have fitted well with Orwell's grim descriptions of existence in the totalitarian superstate of Oceania, but this proved unacceptable to their financial backers. Their solution was to use a process called bleach bypass to create the film's very distinctive washed-out look, dominated by blacks and greys, about as close as a colour film can get to monochrome. There are few, if any, bright colours except in the brief sequences where the film's hero Winston Smith and his lover Julia travel into the countryside. Most of the film is set in a London which has become a bleak urban wasteland. Although the novel is sometimes categorised as science fiction, there are no ""Star Wars"" type special effects. Orwell's widow Sonia, shortly before she died in 1980, gave permission for the film on condition that such effects were not used, which was a wise stipulation. Her husband's vision of the future was not a shiny, hi-tech one; Oceanian society has actually regressed technologically since the 1940s as the only new inventions the Party tolerates are those like the telescreens which make it easier for them to control the populace. The film is noteworthy for two remarkable performances, the first from John Hurt as Winston. He is part of the Outer Party, the state's army of bureaucratic functionaries. (The other two social classes in Oceania are the Inner Party, or ruling elite, and the proles, or industrial workers). Although the Outer Party officially form the regime's middle class, they live in squalid, deprived conditions, suggesting that life for the proles must be even harsher. Winston works at the Ministry of Truth (i.e. Ministry of Propaganda) where his job is to rewrite history and official records to make them accord with the current Party line. (Orwell's intention was to satirise Stalin, who had done something very similar, particularly writing Trotsky out of Soviet history). Winston is secretly guilty of thoughtcrime- in Oceania even thinking thoughts critical of the Party is a crime- and joins what he believes is a resistance movement, only to find that he has been betrayed by an agent provocateur. As played by Hurt, Winston is a shabby, middle-aged everyman figure, in some ways pathetic, in others heroic. Apart from Julia, he is the only character prepared to make a stand, however futile, against the evil rule of the Party.Suzanna Hamilton (who seemed to be a promising newcomer but has since disappeared from view) is good as Julia, but the other great performance comes from Richard Burton as O'Brien, the high-ranking Inner Party member who betrays Winston and supervises the physical and mental torture which is designed to break him psychologically. (The Party's greatest desire is not only to crush dissent but also to destroy the very possibility of thoughtcrime). This was Burton's last film; he died shortly after completing it and it is a fitting end to his career. His O'Brien is patient yet remorseless, never becoming angry or raising his voice yet implacable in his belief in the Party and its right to rule. Since the end of the Cold War, only a few years after this film was made, the political concerns which inspired Orwell's book have perhaps not seemed so relevant, at least in the West, although there still remain parts of the world, notably Kim Jong-Il's North Korea, where the system of government is not too dissimilar to that of Big Brother's Oceania. For the rest of us, however, the rise of a totalitarian superstate is perhaps not the greatest threat we have to face. (Something along the lines of Huxley's ""Brave New World"" may be a greater danger for our future). This does not, however, mean that the novel itself has lost its relevance and it remains one of the most eloquent denunciations of tyranny in the English language. I will not compare Radford's film to the two earlier adaptations, as it is a long time since I last saw either of them, but it strikes me as a very decent attempt to translate Orwell's eloquence into cinematic terms. 8/10",1984
15,sddavis63,It's Unsettling How Relevant This Is Today,8,11 December 2015,"The movie comes across as robotic, passionless and bleak. And that is not a criticism. It's exactly the way it should be. This is George Orwell's ""1984"" after all - his frightening portrayal of a future fascist state and its desire to turn its citizens into mindless and passionless robots existing in a bleak society. It's a movie adaptation of a book, of course (a book I read many years ago) and so there can be quibbles about how well or how poorly Michael Radford (who directed this and wrote the screenplay) captured the novel - but I thought that certainly in terms of the mood he created he did a marvellous job. Even the repeated exchanges of ""I love you"" between Winston and Julia were robotic and passionless - a robotic rebellion against a robotic society. Basically I thought this was very well done. John Hurd did a good job as Winston, and Richard Burton as O'Brien, who comes to represent the fascist state for us as he tortures Winston in an attempt to ""rehabilitate"" him was quite good in this - also cold and passionless throughout. Suzanna Hamilton's Julia was almost eerily robotic, in spite of the fact that she was really the lead protagonist, leading Winston into rebellion against the control of Big Brother.The portrayal of the state was interesting as far as it went. Winston's job was the constant re-writing of history so that the past would always support the party line of the present (summed up by the motto ""whoever controls the past controls the future, and whoever controls the present controls the past."") In addition to that there was the relentless propaganda, constant surveillance, and continual war as a means of controlling the population and giving them an enemy to vent against (probably by doing so preventing them from releasing their frustration against their own country.) The internal ""enemy"" revolved around the figure of Emmanuel Goldstein. Did he really exist? I'm not sure. Or was he just a mythical figure invented by the state, so that anyone who didn't buy into the society could simply be denounced as a follower of Goldstein and Goldstein's ideas; a part of an organized conspiracy against the security represented by the state. Even the concept of ""Big Brother"" is intriguing - and the question was raised in the movie. Was there really a Big Brother, or was there just ""the party"" who invented this leader image of ""Big Brother"" (complete with the ubiquitous portrait that looked down on everyone?) I'd guess the latter.What I found most unsettling about this was actually how relevant it remains today. Propaganda, the manipulation of news, image politics and the idolization of ""leader"" figures, unending war, the rewriting of history to suit the present, the willingness of some politicians at least to outright lie (and to be believed by many even as they lie shamelessly) - all of this is a part of the reality of many (perhaps most) Western ""democratic"" countries today. Orwell was writing fiction - but was he also a prophet of sorts?It would help to have read the novel before watching the movie, because by their very nature novels can give more details and background, but in terms of the overall mood and bleakness of the society: the movie captures this brilliantly.

16,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"I think, therefore I am.",8,27 August 2020,"This bleak, Orwellian film - based on Orwell's novel of the same name - sees Britain ruled by a ruthless totalitarian society which pumps ever-changing propaganda into each and every citizen. In '1984 (1984)', almost everything is considered a sin and the reminders of that are constant. People get carted away and forced to confess to crimes they probably didn't commit, crimes so inoffensive you wonder why anybody even bothers to enforce their punishment. I mean, you can even be charged of a 'thought crime'. In a world such as this, how can one remain themselves - much less rebel? The closest answer is, of course, to love. Surely this, as with all truth, is objective and can't be touched? It isn't quite as simple as that, though. After all, if Big Brother tells you that two plus two is five, who are you to argue? The movie is thematically rich and intellectually stimulating, an ominous and enigmatic examination of the nature of truth, free-will and societal oppression. It's often genuinely unsettling, the projected visage of Big Brother bearing down on our protagonist every step of the way, and its victories are small. It isn't exactly a hopeful affair. The most optimistic reading of its ending is still rather grave, indeed. As it moves into its inevitable final movement, it becomes as frightening and frustrating as any horror movie ever has. It's remarkably gripping, a cautionary tale that's well worth your time. Just don't expect it to hold your hand and tell you everything is going to be okay. 8/10",1984

19,TheMovieDiorama,Nineteen Eighty-Four authoritatively fictionalises truth in the midst of mass totalitarianism.,7,15 May 2020,"London, 1984. Formerly known as England, now the governmental repressive state of Oceania. Outside the colossal walls of Airstrip One, containing a society manipulated by an omnipotent political party sought to oppress its regimentation of people, a war rages on with East Asia and Eurasia. Mounted screens consume the dilapidated interiors, issuing mass surveillance and deceiving propagandism across the authoritarian state. The party's supreme leader, Big Brother, ""always watching"". Their overwhelming control of its inhabitants prevent unapproved political and personal thoughts, punishing those who arbitrarily exude ""Thoughtcrime"". Individualism tyrannical relinquished by totalitarianism. Soldiers, social stratum workers and civil servants. All representing metaphorical cogs in a mechanical communistic locomotive that propels historical negationism.For Winston, a diligent employee of the Ministry of Truth, the regime's overbearing power forces him to embrace insanity. Humanism diminishes within his soul daily. He begins a forbidden romance with a fellow worker, but must keep the illicit affair hidden from proletarian society. As such consequences could extinguish his remaining individualistic embers.Radford's mostly faithful adaptation of Orwell's titular dystopian novel manages to perpetuate the source material's plunging darkness of bleak realities. The novel itself, remains one of the greatest pieces of literature to ever be conceived. Its influence, regardless if one has read its contents or not, is scattered across pop culture, political ideologies and art conceptions across the globe. Drawing parallels to instances of communism, dictatorial states and totalitarian governments that still, despite being written in '49, apply to various governmental bodies operating today. Orwell undoubtedly formulated a masterpiece of modern-world thinking. Still, the book is not the medium being reviewed here. Radford's gloriously British adaptation is. And simply put, it's a solid illustration of the core ideas that Orwell had originally implemented. To capture the full-scale of its central perpetual war and governmental surveillance would be a near-impossible task. Rather unfortunately, any and all adaptations are just mere shadows of a greater work of fiction, with the same being applied here.However the pivotal story of Winston, as he rewrites history in accordance to the party's socialistic ideologies, is captivatingly maintained throughout. Radford initially minimising Orwell's obtuse language to allow Deakins' bleakly beautiful cinematography to build the foundations of its oppressed world. Exposition is kept to a minimum, as we follow Winston's mundane daily routines with fragments of private thoughts embedded throughout. Haunted by searing memories and replenishing desires. His inner rebellious nature soon overwhelming the outer emotionless facade, portrayed exquisitely by an effortless performance from Hurt. The illicit affair with Julia soon comes to fruition, an underdeveloped crucial aspect of Winston's humanity that severely lacked any impact within this adaptation. Regrettably, rather rushed. The buildup to the rural meetup and subversive exchange was non-existent, mostly due to the disjointed narrative that had far too much world-building to establish.Burton, in what was his last performance, soon enters the foray as the calmly antagonistic party member O'Brien. His introduction initiating a sharp change of pace, tone and narrative style. The eventual attempts of ""rehabilitation"" and systematic torture for indoctrinating ""doublethink"", holding two contradictory thoughts simultaneously, almost resembled a complete different feature in itself. Orwellian's poetically philosophical language seeping through Burton's commanding voice. The infamous ""2 + 2 = 5"" false dogma. If everyone believes something, even if it is factually incorrect, then it must be true. The psychological resistance to disbelief. Whilst this second half is extraordinarily engaging, to the point where each poignant word lingers momentarily (""You are outside history. You unexist.""), it failed to marinate with the visually explicit first half. As soon as the ""Thought Police"" storm the screen, a sharp snap of transition arises within the story's aesthetic. Consequently, the mind needs adjusting to the psychologically inclined second half, which abruptly arrived with no indication. The score headed by Lennox' Eurythmics suited the opaque ambience, although occasionally repetitive with its style.Regardless, Ninety Eighty-Four remains a faithful adaptation to, what can only be described as, nationalistic futurology. Orwell is a challenge. A behemoth of political vocabulary and insight. To even attempt such cohesive translation deserves recognition for sheer audacious ambition. Whilst it will always pale in comparison, this film manages to incite and excite through fearful visuals and commanding performances. Perhaps ""1984"" isn't so far off from our current reality...",1984

21,southdavid,Party Favours,5,6 November 2019,"I've been debating this review for a few days, the bottom line is - I didn't like ""1984"" - but was I supposed to? Is it the best version of the source material that it could be? Does the source novel even lend itself to be filmed?Winston Smith (John Hurt) lives under the control of a totalitarian regime, at a time of war. His job is to rewrite the history to better reflect the parties' opinions and ideals. Already internally questioning the regime more than he should and following a discovery of proof that the regime are lying to the people, he begins an illegal affair with a party member, Julia (Suzanna Hamilton).So there's definitely lots to admire about this production. Hurt and Hamilton give brave and bold performances. The setting is brilliantly realised, the oppression is manifested well, with the destitute lives of the members palpable through the screen. The world of the film looks like it has been at war for years, smashed concrete and rubble. It is, to answer my second question, probably the best version of the source material that it is possible to make. Even if you remade it today, you'd struggle to provide a truer version, or one that greater captures both the hypothetical 1984 of the book, or the realism of 1948.But, to move on to the third question. Is the book that filmable? I'm not convinced. Much of it is intangible stuff, inner monologues and thoughts, descriptions of how the world works. A lot of this is missing, making the adaptation confusing at times - certainly to anyone unfamiliar with the book. I feel like, away from those descriptions of life under the regime, the book doesn't have enough plot to lend itself to adaptation.Tough to enjoy, easier to appreciate, ultimately though it's hard to actively recommend watching it.",1984
22,hellraiser7,No Country for Dreamers,10,7 May 2020,"The fundamental trouble with society sometimes is that it never knows how good it truly has it until it's too late.This film is one of my favorite sci-fi films of all time but also it's one of the saddest films of all time, because it's one of those rare dystopian stories where for once the protagonist doesn't have home court advantage. ""1984"" is one of my favorite books of all time, despite not cheerful it's fascinating all the same, it was the very first in the Dystopian category I've read and still one of the best. This film didn't disappoint as it really felt true to how I envisioned the story.
The plotline in the story I think is frighteningly plausible, and it's also a bit prolific as a few things in the book and film are actually happening today and show we could be getting dangerously close if we dare take more steps into dangerous territory.I'll admit reading most of the book and seeing some of this movie did scare me, as this is a place, I honestly never want to ever live in. It's not a dysfunctional society it's actually a society that works but the problem is it works too well. You can see there is a twisted and perverse logic to how they keep things orderly and operational but it doesn't flourish, like any dry rotten fruit tree it may be still standing, well structured, and tall but it's branches are bare and there is fungus that is beginning to set in and eat away at it.The set pieces of the film are great, I really like the looks of the society, despite taking place in the future it's also a step away as it's a society that's constantly stuck on neutral. We see most of this society is war torn due to the damage from the so call war they're currently fighting. From the buildings to the streets everything is just dirty, grimy, everywhere you turn it looks like something is broken and falling apart which perfectly reflects the psyche of the society. There is one bit of high technology we see which are all of the big screens that are just everywhere, unfortunately it's not for entertainment purposes this is a way to monitor the masses.The music is great and fits well with the film, most of it done by the Eurythmics which is cool since I like that band. Like the music in those dream sequences which fit well as it's invokes a mysterious, wonderous, calm, and hopeful atmosphere. As well as song in end credits Julia which is strangely beautiful and a little sad.I really like how there are lots of things like in the book when you watch the movie a second time you uncover more, and it gives you more food for thought. The screen they see of big brother is a picture of some man in a mustache who looks sort of like Joseph Stalin which of course implicates irony. The shows once again shows one of the societies evil, as it has combined church and state as they went so far as to make itself a god like entity with technology and everyone gathers to watch it's screens and like any religious congregation have their rituals of worship for it. But we all know this is a false and perverse religion for Big Brother is a poor imitation of a God for he is a soulless entity that doesn't promote love as it is loveless.One of the things it has is The Ministry of Information which of course is the press, however instead of reporting the actual news most of the information retrieved is redacted and rewritten to whatever the government wants said. This part I felt was prolific on the issue with sensationalism, media and information manipulation as well as the mob mentality it sometimes can produce.Also we indeed see the extent of the evil of this society, in one scene we see one kid call Winston a thought criminal, another where we see on a train we listen to a choir of kids singing one of the propaganda songs. This is disturbing because it just goes to show innocence in this society is nonexistent, as kids aren't even kids as their being brainwashed and programed by this government to do it's bidding for the future, a future it stole from them.However, what's disturbing to me the most is how the people are both intellectually but also spiritually bankrupt. As we see there is hardly any culture that exists as most books and even the movies and TV shows we love are banned or destroyed. But we also see how there is news of certain particular words becoming obsolete which they say it's a way to keep communication simple, but we know it's the total opposite which is to silence people from communicating at all.But also from the amount of surveillance and a police force called ""Thought Police"" which I always found strange, I always wondered did they have some sort of precogs like in Philp K Dick's ""Minority Report"" to help monitor people's thoughts and if there was one bad thought someone got detained? Well whatever the case, these things have created a world of complete paranoia and distrust that is so bad, you literally can't even trust your own thoughts and feelings. This in a way once again get at the dictum of ignorance is bliss, the forbidding of certain things in life will create a functional blissful existence. But of course, bliss has a double meaning which is death, doing this caused the death of human rights, the right to be human.Another thing about this society is simply how much we truly don't know about it, because of how much they've covered up and obscured the truth. I can't help but wonder, what if the entire world really hasn't been taken over by Big Brother, what if this is just a mere piece of county as we never really see outside of the place except what were told and shown which really isn't much. In one scene was it really the other side that fired off the oncoming missiles or was it the government itself that fired missiles on its own society, just to continue to mislead them. Were also not sure that the decade their living in is really 1984 at all, as most history from the past has been lost. But I can't help but think this society in reality is actually losing the current war and the society they live in is really on the verge of collapse, but the corrupt government doesn't want to admit it.However, what also powers the story are the two characters Winston and Julia both well cast. From one of my favorite actors the late great John Hurt, I felt he embodied the role really well as we see him play Winston whom is a downtrodden man that is just going though the motions in the society he lives in. But we see deep within him there is a small spark of humanity that has formed and as the film progress starts to create fire.Suzanna Hamilton this actress is another one of my celeb crushes, I actually had a crush on when I saw this film as a teen, she's fraking hot. And, another under rated actress I really like, that I feel sadly didn't have enough for the silver screen afterward. Her character is just beautiful inside and out, she has this energy and quiet aggression and feistiness which is part of what produces that spark of humanity in her.Winston and Julia are one of my favorite fictional couples if you can believe that. The book and film is also a romance story but of the tragic kind. I really like the chemistry between both of them, both characters I felt are old souls, dreamers that's were unfortunately born in the wrong decade. Both would have been at home in the decade I was born in, where it actually is 1984.
Both characters really have a couple of things in common, as both have a longing for the things of the past which is easy to emphasize with as all of us as time goes on seek out remnants of our past. This need shows the importance of nostalgia and seeking and remembering history so that it can bring light to help us live in the present, for without it we are truly lost.As both characters interact, we see both slowly but surely become more human, both really help bring out something that has been long repressed inside them and is vitally missing and needed in the existence they live in. And we see both are dreamers as they not just both share some telepathic bond at least I assume they do from those dream sequences. But also from their time together, they dream and are constantly silently rebelling to build an idealistic and livable existence for each other which gives them the freedom to do and be what they want to be, which is part of what life and being human is about in the first place.All this just makes the story even more tragic, you don't want anything to happen to them and want both of them to live their lives together, the lives they were meant and should have lived. But throughout the film you carry a feeling of dread and doom as the odds are against both of them and might not be in their favor as the society they rebel against you sense is slowly closing in; a society that has committed the greatest and most unforgivable crime against humanity, the destruction of love.The ending is heartbreaking, I'll admit I couldn't help but have a tear or two as it goes with an old saying, ""Sometimes one voice of reason isn't enough to quill a society gone mad."" If the film and story has a message to me it's on the importance of being human, treasuring humanity, and to love, never let anything and anyone take it away from you because the minute you do is the day when the dream/dreamers die, is also the day when humanity dies.Rating: 4 stars",1984
23,Captain_Couth,Interesting re-invention of the classic George Orwell novel.,8,27 February 2005,"1984 (1984) was another cinematic version of the classic novel from the ever interesting novelist George Orwell. He had a terrifying vision of our future world. A world that is under the thumb of a brutal totalitarian government who cares little for the people and keeps them down through repression and poverty. The novel is still effective today as it was over fifty-five years ago. Many of the things that have happened in the novel are becoming ever so present in today's world.Winston Smith is a citizen in the country of Oceania. He's just another slave to the government's war machine. They seem to be at a constant war with it's rival Eurasia (a.k.a. East Asia). The war has been going on for years and it seems to never end. The people are also angry at a man named Goldstein. Everyone vents their anger towards this individual who speaks truths but no one will listen to this person's pleas. By the way, the government is extremely bored and has a lot of time on it's hands. But Winston soldiers on, pass the tele-images of Big Brother, a way from the prying eyes of the children (who are instructed to snitch on those who seem to be think criming). He endures his repressive lifestyle until he sees a light at the end of a dark and dreary tunnel, a shred of hope in a world that's a living hell. Can Winston weather the storm or will he just become another lifeless soul in a polluted and corrupt world? Not a direct translation of the novel but it incorporates it's theme, mood, elements and characters. Michael Radford does an excellent job of transporting the world of Oceania upon the silver screen. John Hurt played the role of Winston with his usual effectiveness, such a great actor. Suzanna Hamilton is workable as Julia. But the main star is Richard Burton in his last role as O'Brien, a government official who has no emotions left within his soul. He has neither feelings nor empathy for his fellow man. Only the good for the party and Big Brother. A shame that Richard Burton could have never capitalize on his role in this movie. He could have made an evil villain in another production. In a world of sociopaths he could have been their king.Recommended for fans of the book, They'll enjoy this reinvention of the novel. Maybe some day they'll be a true film adaptation of the novel. Until then this will suffice the curious.",1984
24,jamesrupert2014,Excellent adaptation of Orwell's bleak and timeless cautionary tale,9,15 October 2019,"John Hurt is everyman 'Winston Smith', living in a bleak ruined England under the brutal grip of the all-powerful 'Party' as represented by the omnipresent image of ""Big Brother"". Orwell's searing social commentary on the dangers of totalitarian rule, with its historical revisionism, manipulation of language, constant surveillance, and attempts to control thought itself seems to resonate regardless of whether progressive or regressive governments are pulling the strings. Hurt, who looks like he is on death's door in every movie I have seen him in, is perfect as the sad, pale, emaciated Smith, as are Suzanna Hamilton as Julia, his illicit lover and more superficial co-revolutionary, and Richard Burton (in his last role) as O'Brien, the enigmatic tool of the inner party. The film was shot in London in the spring of 1984, the time and place the story takes place (perhaps the only film version of a predictive story to do so) and evokes the dreary feel of the novel's endless war and of the hardships endured by the inhabitants of ""Airstrip One"". Although there is some controversy about Virgin Film's insistence that the film be scored by syntho-pop-duo 'The Eurythmics', I found the music to be appropriate to the film although it does make the production seem a bit dated. All-in-all, an excellent adaptation of one of the English language's greatest novels (and literary warnings).",1984
25,Polaris_DiB,More homage than adaptation,7,30 August 2011,"It's interesting, but when watching an adaptation of a novel I do not often come to the conclusion that the adaptation is a good ""homage."" By the very nature of adaptation it would seem the filmmaker has to pay homage to the book, but 1984 seems to be the singular film to have that distinction.Orwell's 1984 needs little introduction--in a world where not many people read more than a book a year, most people still acknowledge the references and understand the general gist of 1984, even if their pop-culture induced intertextuality or straight-up Cliff's Note night-before-the-high-school-5-paragraph-essay-is-due reading is the closest they've gotten. It is a shame because of course like Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, Orwell's 1984 is significantly text-based in a way somewhat under-evaluated. Orwell's books are by and large about the politics of language, and the famed Newspeak of the novel is dripping with irony and anger in a way that doesn't get translated to screen--there, it just sounds like a typical futurism lingo.So here's the problem: 1984 is pretty much evenly divided into two parts, the first part following Winston's exploration of his thought crime evolving toward a real desire for resistance, the second half a protracted sociophilosophical discussion as Winston's entire psychology is broken down bit by bit. The first half is the easier to adapt into film--it results in what this movie is, a gritty gray-scaled urban nightmare. The second half is a little more difficult, and this movie lived up to the challenge as best it could. I believe it is the second half why Gilliam's Brazil ended up the way it did and Lucas' THX 1138 decided to just go for a chase scene--these are visual, exciting motifs. The end of 1984 is a multiday discussion on politics, power, language, truth, and everything connected to crushing all of same. Radford helps keep the story going visually by focusing on the torture aspect of it, while also slipping occasionally into Winston's mind for brief countryside interludes. It helps keep the tension going while a summary of the high points of the book's discussion get covered. It shows more the fascination and fear the book invokes, than develops its own fear and fascination itself.Which is a not ungood choice (sorry, just had to make Orwell's corpse twitch just once). There are certain scenes of this movie that do not really follow but do create a strong tone that pretty much fits the feel of the novel perfectly. It is easy to point to Roger Deakins' cinematography, but it is weirder to mention that the Eurythmics add a lot of their own to the chill. The way that this movie was shot during the timeline the book took place certainly really helps the acknowledgment that the people involved in this teleplay were not just in it for a paycheck, but also had the book squarely in mind. The production design itself looks like they just pulled into some really bad neighborhoods and started filming, though there was obviously a lot more work done than that.So really, I am glad that this movie is the adaptation of 1984 and I would not recommend another filmmaker try to do this one one better. This movie gets about as close to the text as cinema can, without starting to alter some very important aspects that might as well just make it 1984-inspired than 1984-adapted. However, as fond as I was watching this movie, in this case it is still significantly important that the viewer read the book as well, as the politics of language are harder to follow when spoken in muted, grungy dialog rather than read at your own pace.--PolarisDiB",1984
26,strong-122-478885,The Praxis Of DoubleThink - 2 + 2 = 5,6,9 August 2014,"Favorite Movie Quote: ""Can you hold onto two completely contradictory thoughts at the same time?"" Warning! - 'Big Brother' Is Watching! Grim. Bleak. Depressing.This brutally joyless film is a cold and sobering remake based upon George Orwell's famous, futuristic novel (of the same name), which was written back in 1948. The original movie-production of 1984 was released in 1956.Set in the fictitious country of Oceania, in the year 1984, this is the horribly dismal place where citizen Winston Smith ekes out his incredibly squalid existence. Working for the Ministry of Truth, Winston sits quietly inside his tiny cubicle, obediently rewriting history according to the strictest specifications of The Party (aka. Big Brother).Oceania is run by a ruthless totalitarian government known as the Superstate. All of Oceania's laws area stringently enforced by the barbaric Thought Police.Winston keeps a secret diary hidden away at home. This is forbidden. It is considered Thought-Crime.Winston meets Julia, an outer-party worker, and begins an illicit affair with her. This is forbidden. It is considered Sex-Crime.Soon Winston and Julia are caught in their defiant act of Sex-Crime and they are promptly taken to the Ministry of Love where torture and brainwashing are the order of the day. It takes no time at all for Winston and Julia to betray one another.It's inside Room #101 that Winston is eventually taken for further interrogation. It is here that he is forced to face and endure his own worst fears.The Soundtrack for 1984 was written and performed by pop superstars 'The Eurythmics'.",1984
27,ackstasis,"""Freedom is the freedom to say two plus two equals four.""",7,13 November 2007,"There's something peculiar about the film adaptations of George Orwell's celebrated dystopian novel, ""Nineteen Eighty-Four."" Since I read the book for the first time earlier this year, I have enjoyed two film renditions of the story, Michael Anderson's '1984 (1956)' and now Michael Radford's very timely 'Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984).' Cinematically, there's little unique about these two films. When it comes down to it, they're both rather uninspired pieces of film-making, really lacking anything that would make them significant achievements. However, the piece of literature upon which they are are based is so incredibly powerful that the remarkable story overshadows the films' other attributes. Indeed, considering the near-perfection of Orwell's 1949 novel, it would be detrimental (and rather immoral, if I may say so) to make any major changes to the plot. Thus, Michael Radford's film sort of coasts through the story of Winston Smith and his rebellion against Big Brother, more out of duty rather than raw inspiration. However, it does do a decent job of it, treating Orwell's story with the respect it deserves, and so praise must be awarded where it is due.For years, Winston Smith (John Hurt) has endured a sordid existence in London, the capital of Airstrip One in the nation of Oceania. The year is 1984, and all citizens now operate under the strict guidelines of the Party, under the constant surveillance of the Thought Police. Day by day, it is Winston's duty, as an Outer Party member in the Ministry of Truth, to ""revise"" history in accordance with Big Brother's most recent requirements. Once a person has been erased from the official documents, he ceases to exist; indeed, he never existed. When the Party decides to cut chocolate rations from thirty grams to a mere twenty-five, it is Winston's responsibility to alter the facts: in actuality, the chocolate rations were never at thirty grams. They were at twenty, and now Big Brother has chosen to increase the rations to twenty-five grams. The enthusiastic response of Party-devoted neighbour Parsons (Gregor Fisher) to this announcement is a testament to the lethal efficiency of these continual revisions. The human memory cannot seemingly be relied upon to recall such information, and so the Party is the only trustworthy source.Yet Winston Smith is not alone in his misgivings about the Party. He eventually strikes up a romantic relationship with a mysterious young woman named Julia (Suzanna Hamilton), and the two meet regularly to satisfy their desires for each other, in doing so rebelling against the strict rules enforced by the Thought Police. Smith decides to place his trust in an Inner-Party member named O'Brien (Richard Burton in his last screen role), but this turns out to be a sting operation, and both Smith and Julia are subsequently arrested and taken to the Ministry of Love to be ""rehabilitated."" Via numerous grueling means of torture, O'Brien sets about destroying every last hint of Smith's rebellion, delaying his inevitable execution until he not only obeys Big Brother but also loves him. The treatment doesn't allow for rebels to make martyrs of themselves, since dissenters are only murdered once they have been twisted back into perfect citizens; until they will wholeheartedly agree that, if the Party says so, then 2 + 2 = 5.Though there are a few images that will surely stay in my memory for a long time (those shots with the swarms of filthy rats certainly qualify), 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' curiously lacks the unique visual style of many of the decade's other dystopian sci-fi classics, such as Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner (1982)' and Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil (1985)' {which is probably the greatest Orwell-inspired film you're ever likely to see}. The film was shot in London around the precise time in which the original novel is set, but the setting seemed to recall Britain in the early 1940s, a historic city that has been torn apart by the constant onslaught of the enemy's aerial attacks. Though he had initially toyed about with the idea of filming in black-and-white, cinematographer Roger Deakins used a film processing technique called Bleach bypass to create the film's washed-out colour visuals. The most engaging sequences undoubtedly involve Burton and Hurt during the torture sessions, which are almost painful to watch. Winston Smith is reduced to such a horrific mess of a man that you really do despair when O'Brien declares him to be the final person of his kind. I also liked the idea of Smith regularly slipping into his hallucination of the flowing green fields, and that gutting moment when even this sanctuary is infiltrated by Big Brother and his all-powerful totalitarian regime.",1984
28,mjneu59,1984 in 1984,7,20 December 2010,"Filming George Orwell's grim, dystopian horror story in the year it was set and in the actual locations specified by the novel lends a frightening sense of credibility to this adaptation, without a doubt the closest in spirit to Orwell's original vision. It's been called perhaps the bleakest film ever made in the English language, and not without good reason: such unrelenting pessimism has rarely (if ever) been seen on screen, making the lines in John Hurt's face almost painful to watch after a while.Visually, the film is the equivalent of an open sore. Credit goes to the art director and cinematographer for recreating Orwell's Oceania in all its seedy splendor, capturing the chill and decay of a closed, totalitarian society in tones of washed-out grays and greens. The fact that the year 1984 is already behind us doesn't alter the impact of the story; if anything, our familiarity today with Orwell's ideas of doublethink, ideological brainwashing, and non-stop propaganda help make the movie less of a cautionary fable and more a depressing preview of events in the not too distant future.",1984
29,GiraffeDoor,Freedom is the freedom to say 4 plus 4 makes 8,8,25 October 2019,"As a die hard fan of the novel I'm willing to admit this is as good an adaptation as we can hope to ever get.A very literary novel (in fact, academic) becomes a disarmingly sensuous and hypnotic picture as horrible things lurk just out of sight.They cherry pick a lot of quotes and kind of VO them which can be a bit painful for those who read them all before a hundred times but the story has energy, our two stars are superb and the raw sexual energy is intact.More than a little confusing. I think one would gain a lot from knowing the book well though.",1984
30,jimbo-53-186511,"This could have been great, but it more or less continually drowns under the weight of its own pretentiousness",4,15 December 2016,"Winston Smith (John Hurt) is a thought-criminal whose daily work involves rewriting history. Smith (along with several others) lives within a totalitarian regime where all thoughts and feelings are deemed to be a crime. However, Smith attempts to overthrow this 'Big Brother' regime when he falls in love with fellow citizen Julia (Suzanna Hamilton).When George Orwell first published this book back in the late 1940's he perhaps wasn't aware of how accurate his predictions of our future society would turn out to be. Whilst we're not under a totalitarian regime, we are all now part of a society where we are more or less able to be continually monitored whether through CCTV or via internet usage. Therefore I have to praise Orwell for being so visionary, but sadly this adaptation of his own novel fell way short of my expectations...Given the fact that this was supposed to be about a man rebelling against a cruel and unfeeling dictatorship I expected there to be examples of an inner rebellion dotted throughout the film. Aside from a rather chilling finale, this never really happens and it renders the film to be rather dull a lot of the time. We don't really learn much about the characters and Gregor Fisher's talents seem to be wasted in an underwritten role which never seems to have much bearing on the story. I also never bought into Julia and Winston's relationship; it did seem to come out of nowhere and had no real build-up meaning that I just found it all a bit ridiculous (the age gap between Hurt and Hamilton is also a noticeable issue and I couldn't help but feel like I was watching a pervy old man taking advantage of a much younger woman). All of this left me feeling rather indifferent to their relationship and to Smith's own personal struggles.I think the thing that bothered me the most about this film is the way it's presented in a really phony 'art-house' type manner. Director and screenwriter Michael Radford seems uninterested in exploring Smith's world - there is a hint of a 'have' and 'have nots' society between the Proliterians and the Bureaucrats which could have been interesting, but is never really explored. The whole film also reeks of pretentiousness - most of the film revolves around Julia and Winston's romance, but their conversations and the general dialogue is lifeless and there is so much nudity that at times it feels like you're watching a soft-core porn. I understand that this existed to highlight their rebellion against Big Brother, but how far do you have to go before it starts to become self-indulgent?Later films such as Equilibrium and V for Vendetta have explored similar concepts but both of those films were stylish and entertaining. Sadly this version of 1984 never really worked for me as I found it to be pretentious, self-indulgent and pretty boring as well. It is only wonderful turns from John Hurt and Richard Burton that prevent the film from getting a lower score.",1984
31,rooprect,"Powerful, unusual, dystopian scifi flick.",9,23 December 2019,"""1984"" is a tale published in 1948 predicting a nightmarish totalitarian society where the government controls every aspect of existence. The government controls not just just everyday life but the recording of history and, most disturbingly, the memories and emotions we contain in our own heads. It follows the story of our hero Mr. Smith (John Hurt) who falls into a secret, illicit love affair with Julia (Suzanna Hamilton) in a society where love and individuality are swiftly and brutally extinguished.This dystopian scenario has been visited in many excellent science fiction stories as far back as the invention of science fiction. Noteworthy films that hit this subject include the excellent ""Brazil"" (1985), ""Rollerball"" (1975), Orson Welles's ""The Trial"" (1962) or if you prefer your fare on the more satirical, sarcastic side, check out Paul Veerhoven's ""Starship Troopers"" (1997). This leads me to why ""1984"" is a breed apart. It's because it's one of the rare dystopian scifi flicks that approaches the subject without any satire, dark comedy, and hardly any fantasy. Aside from its nightmarish, dark visuals, this is a chillingly realistic, chillingly ""now"" film.Don't get me wrong, dark humor is a great way to approach the subject, because how else can we stomach something so disturbing? But that's precisely why this film's straightforward approach is worth seeing. Artistically speaking, sarcasm distances us from the subject material. It makes us feel as if we're watching a fantastical tale through a prism of cynical comedy. But that same prism removes us from the impending reality of the story. When the credits roll, we can say to ourselves ""Good thing that doesn't describe me!""But here in ""1984"" there is no comedy. There is no sarcasm or satire. There is just a straightforward presentation of a future where the government controls society. And, as of the year I'm writing this review (2019), this isn't a joke so maybe we shouldn't treat it as one. With that in mind, this film is the only one of the dystopian classics that presents it in a very believable, cautionary way. As far fetched as it may seem, what we see on the screen is very real whether we're talking about Hitler-era censorship, or present day China, or the future of Western civilization under the autocratic rule of leaders who seek to foister their narratives on the minds of all their subjects. ""1984"" puts us in the middle of the crisis, without any sarcastic winks or humorous nudges. It is an unsettling, yet oddly empowering, feeling to watch this film and realize that we aren't quite there yet, though rapidly approaching it with every totalitarian leader we empower.What makes this film rewarding to watch (and not simply depressing) is the fascinating interaction between Mr Smith and the antagonist O'Brien (Richard Burton). This is 100% due to Burton's excellent portrayal of not just a faceless tyrannical enemy but actually a human nemesis. Ultimately he shows us that the human race isn't fighting against some computerized zombie state but rather, we are fighting against human nature itself.If this review didn't bore you, in other words, if you enjoy being challenged by wordy, heady, philosophical concepts rather than flicks that make you spill your popcorn, then check this movie out asap. It doesn't have a lot of eye catching action & special effects, but the images themselves are deeply poetic, and the performances (especially in the final act) are so powerful they don't need any fluff. They don't make em like this anymore, but I hope the latest crop of young filmmakers are taking notice and learning. This is a story that needs to be told to every generation.",1984
32,dworldeater,Great adaptation of the novel,9,17 February 2019,"1984 is a dystopian science fiction film that is based off George Orwell's novel. While film is a different medium than the novel, it is very faithful to the source material and is a powerful movie. John Hurt is Winston Smith, a government employee that edits the news to cast Big Brother in a positive light until he meets a girl (Julia) and starts to go against the system. This takes place in UK, now known as Oceana, where there is constant war, surveillance and inaccurate news. Well, that much has been predicted and is happening right now. Oceana is a totalitarian state that rules with an iron fist that advocates mass conformity and absolute adherence to the state. The film is very bleak with the landscape wartorn with the populace living in poverty and squalor. This is a very depressing, but thought provoking film about what can happen if the people let the government abuse their power. 1984 has excellent performances and visuals and is a great companion piece to the novel, which should be mandatory reading.",1984
33,caspian1978,A Powerful film for the ages,7,18 November 2003,"Is it just me, or did George Orwell love ending his stories on a sad note? Having read Animal Farm in grade school, I wasn't too shocked to have read the ending of 1984. Both stories are very political as well as powerful. The grim endings only imply the horror of a possible future of the masses.When trying to explain what Room 101 is and the scene with the rats and the ending of 2+2=, you have to imagine the situation that the main character is going through. What exactly in reality and what is happening in his head? If you think about it, the entire film could be happening in his mind. Accepting this, much of what is unexplainable is now explainable. The overall message of a society conditioning their people on what to believe is the truth. My grad school Professor almost had a stroke in the middle of a speech on ethics when he compared President Bush's orders in invading Iraq to the order of reasoning in 1984. Although his ideas were extreme, I get the point.",1984
34,Jonny_Numb,exceptional adaptation,7,30 July 2003,"Orwell's ""1984"" is a book that struck many nerves and continues to provide an ever-relevant reflection of what our society is at risk of becoming. Does this film do the text justice?  Well, yes and no.  As far as the creation of a dismal, defeatist future where men's thoughts are regulated like clockwork is concerned, director Michael Radford succeeds--the society as a whole is bleak and degraded, filled with darkness and grime.  The casting is inspired, from John Hurt's portrayal of Winston Smith to Richard Burton's scene-stealing O'Brien (the interrogation scene is torturously convincing thanks to their efforts).  On the downside, as others have mentioned, the novel struck so many nerves--far too many to incorporate into a normal-length feature film--that the movie feels stripped down and simplified; yes, it includes the key points from Orwell's text, but not nearly enough.  Perhaps this material would've been better suited to a two-night miniseries instead.  There is a lot to admire about ""1984,"" and also a lot of glimpses of what could have been.7/10",1984
35,dierregi,Perhaps even more disturbing in 2021 than in 1984,7,7 September 2021,"The gloomy tale of Winston and Julia is turning into our reality, perhaps less visually grim but as mentally stultifying . The ""always connected"" mentality means that people are voluntarily allowing hundreds of small Big Brothers to check what they do and what the like on a daily basis...The world we live in may not be bleak, dirty and poor as the one in the movie, but for sure we already have serious problems with ""thoughtcrimes"" and the Newspeak is already in use, with some words absolutely forbidden. Also, plenty of people have started modifying the past and rebuilding it to better suit their needs: for instance in a real free world destroying every single copy of ""Gone With The Wind"" because some find it ""disturbing"" would be considered censorship, in this world some see it as paying your dues...",1984
36,truemythmedia,Acceptable Adaptation of a Masterclass Novel,8,20 September 2019,"I think the thing I like most about this film is the way that it captures the overall feeling and world of George Orwell's novel, which is, in my opinion the most important part. The story of 1984 is rather basic; not a lot happens, but that's the point. It feels as if Winston is stuck in time, constantly working but not progressing; he is the piece of coral inside the paperweight; he is the knight that repeatedly moves back and forth between two spaces on the chessboard. The world feels hopeless and smothering, and that's elevated by the desaturated, bleak cinematography of DP legend Roger Deakins, the desolate production design of Allan Cameron, and the constantly anemic and exhausted appearance of John Hurt. That feeling of hopelessness pervades the film entirely; it weighs on you like the presence of the oppressive clouds that hovered over the House of Usher as our narrator approached it. In short, this is a very solid adaptation of a novel I figured was more or less unadoptable. For those who wont read Orwell's novel but will sit down to watch a two-hour film, this gets the point across nicely. I think the biggest issues with this film really arise from the anemic nature of the story itself; not a lot happens other than Julia and Winston sneaking off to have sex until the very end. This is a film that places it's meaning not in a spotlight in the front and center, but in the shadowy edges of the frame, and you have to be willing to look with a trained eye to see that meaning shrouded under cover darkness.",1984
37,framptonhollis,chillingly brutal in its depiction of a disturbing dystopia,8,3 June 2017,"This brilliant adaptation of George Orwell's immoral classic of the same name nearly matches its source material in terms of quality (which is quite the achievement, considering the fact that ""1984"" is by far one of the greatest novels I have ever read). The chilling direction and pitch perfect performances help make this disturbing vision all the more of a truthful gut punch. The fact that such a hard hitting and seemingly over the top story remains entirely relevant in today's chaotic political climate is both a disgrace and a testament to Orwell's genius, and the cinematic capturing of Orwell's classic is one of practically unbeatable quality. While little to nothing is added to the plot, the visual accompaniment of the story enhances its impact. The cinematography is fittingly dull, soaked entirely of the joys o color. The performances are simply perfect, making this one of the few novel adaptations I have seen in which I felt that the actors absolutely nailed their performing of the original work's dialogue. At the center of this terrifying satire is the performance of Richard Burton who is both subtle and mind blowingly horrifying in his indescribably villainous role, while John Hurt provides a sometimes timid, sometimes paranoid, and other times absolutely petrified protagonist that attempts to escape from the norms of the totalitarian society he is forced to live in.While not necessarily a ""horror"" movie, there is no doubt that ""1984"" is among the most genuinely SCARY films that I have ever seen. Both the book and film have succeeded in making me shake like drug addicted pepper and salt shakers. The dystopia depicted here accurately displays the horror of an overly controlling and oppressive government system forcing its propaganda upon those below, and outwardly embracing anti-free speech and pro-war beliefs. I must restate how sadly relevant this work remains.",1984

When Winston encounters Julia, a mechanic on the novel-writing machines, and the two begin an illegal love relationship,Winston's views begin to change, and he finds himself relentlessly questioning his government.The movie and the book are very depressing, so, don't watch this movie if you are in a bad day.",1984
39,PimpinAinttEasy,I felt like I was reading the book .....,7,14 March 2016,"Dear Michael Radford, you did a great job adapting Orwell's novel for the big screen.I loved the tracking shot of all those sinister looking people at the beginning of the movie. What a way to start the film. You had me hooked! The close ups of John Hurt's cold and dry face was used to great effect. It sort of underscored the lack of joy and humanity in him. The film was filled with such thin, wiry and robotic looking actors who gave the impression of slowly wasting away. The oppressive post-war imagery characterized by scenes of destruction and decaying grey buildings perfectly evoked the atmosphere in Orwell's novel. The sets were magnificent. I know it is an odd word to use for such a depressing film. But Winston's workplace and O'Brien's office deserve special mention. This must be Alan Cameron's best work. He later worked mostly in commercial big budget films. If anxiety was the natural state of 20th century man (from Mailer), John Hurt's jaded facial expressions and scraggy demeanor expressed all the anxiety of living in a totalitarian state. Winston Smith must be one of his best roles. Best Regards, Pimpin.(7/10)",1984

Much of what was in the book clearly did not make it to the screen ( the film would have been too long otherwise ) but it seems much of what was left out was the more vital parts which would have the film semi-logical.Aside from boring me, much of the movie got my blood boiling. For instance, the scene in which a member of the Thought Police punches Julia in the stomach had me seething with anger!John Hurt is extremely robotic as Winston and Suzanna Hamilton failed to do much better as Julia. Richard Burton was in ill health at the time and died shortly after production so his performance seemed somewhat tired. Gregor Fisher did his best with the little he was given ( I know, I'm biased ) but his efforts were in vain. The worst offender in the cast was Cyril Cusack as the two-faced Mr. Charrington.I don't denounce those who like this film. If it is your bag, then more power to you.

42,mentalcritic,"A nice try, but it errs in leaving out important details",4,28 April 2007,"George Orwell's best-known novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four, has become such a classic analogy of the process of collective mind control that years after the date referred to in the title, readers still consistently fail to understand it. One can often test the intellectual mean of readers, in fact, by asking them to describe its content. Less astute readers will mistake the story for being about the terror of constant surveillance, of having no thought left unchecked by the powers that be. While this is an element of Orwell's nightmare Oceania society, it is not the mechanism by which this awesome extent of thought control is achieved. And once one understands that Orwell's nightmare scenario had more to do with the modification of language in order to make divergent thought difficult or even impossible, the flaws in this film adaptation start to stand out like Patricia Heaton at a conference for adults with Asperger's Syndrome. It is somewhat ironic, because it is the things that the film omits that become its downfall.When Winston, portrayed here in a very convincing fashion by John Hurt, writes the date in his diary, the novel diverts into a thread about his doubts about the date. Since his job is mainly concerned with the rewriting of history, and a truthful history no longer seems to exist, he has little idea of what the date could truly be. For all he knows, it could be 1954, 2024, or 2084. This is a critically important point that a lot of modern essays regarding the novel miss. It was Orwell's way of saying this could be happening at any time, not just at some vague point in that point of dismissal we call the future. Another point the film misses is that the society depicted in the novel was in a transitional stage. The changes necessary to bring the society to the stage depicted in the film likely took place over so many years that, as stated in THX 1138, nobody really noticed until it was too late to complain. The changes still to come would likely take just as long, but that is an ancillary point to the story.George Orwell was quite a believer in the freedom of language, and nowhere is this more apparent in his appendix describing the principles of Newspeak. The real horror of Nineteen Eighty-Four was not the constant surveillance or the legality of torturing disbelievers. The real terror in Orwell's novel was the modification of language to make abstract thought impossible, and non-compliant thought incredibly difficult. Try this experiment on for size if you are having trouble with that idea. Think up all the words you know that describe a woman who is overtly sexual and unashamed of the fact, and think of all the ones that describe such a woman in a flattering manner. When you come to the realisation that the English language does not have any, you will realise that the language modification that Orwell described in his novel has been happening for some time, and continues to happen even today. Thoughts not in keeping with the party ideology must be corrected, even if it involves murdering children.And that is where the major fault of the film lies. Although it spares no detail in describing the squalor and hopelessness the protagonists live in, much of the detail of why they are in this situation has been lost. Describing the reason why the Two Minutes Hate ends with chanting Big Brother's initials or why loving relationships are outlawed except in very specific circumstances is a very tricky thing to pull off in film. Explaining that Big Brother, or rather the people behind that facade, feel threatened when furious, intense emotions are not directed towards them instead of elsewhere, is a task very few directors are equal to. And this is a real problem, because without those bits of background information to glue together Oceania and its motives, the story starts to come apart at the seams. We see moments that were quite evocative in the novel, such as Julia tearing off the party uniform, rendered as incredibly sterile and unmoving in film. Everything seems so perfunctory when it should be a cry to the heavens for answers.And with the true reason for the story's timeless quality lost, the film ironically ends up more dated than a calendar. All films are a product of their time, of course, but some manage to transcend their time and become a cultural icon for all of the ages. I think the fact that Orwell's novel is still read and debated near to sixty years after its publication says it all regarding the timelessness of the novel. The problem for this film is that a mere ten years after its first release, it was not only forgotten, but almost impossible to find. The DVD format allows it to be seen once again, but that only serves to highlight why it was relegated to the most obscure section of the weekly rental market in the first place. Even the most terrifying scenes of the novel, such as when we learn what actually is in Room 101, just come off as a lot of flat recitation in this film. Many libraries in various countries banned the novel for its revolutionary image. I do not even believe the early rental market really noticed this film.Hence, I gave Nineteen Eighty-Four the film a four out of ten. Save the money you are planning to spend on the DVD and buy the novel, along with a copy of Animal Farm, instead.",1984
43,juliankennedy23,Nineteen-eighty four.... In Russia TV watches you.,8,19 May 2009,"Nineteen Eighty Four: 8 out of 10: Most films simply don’t age all that well. Philadelphia with Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington for example simply doesn’t have the same impact today that it did in 1993. (Both gay people in general and AIDS in particular are simply less scary today.) In another example we have seen both technology and fashion move so fast that the futuristic phones in many a seventies sci-fi movie look positively ancient today not to mention the burnt orange and avocado green color scheme of the future that so many seventies sci-fi are stuck with. (I’m looking your way Rollerball.) So how has a film, released when people outside of American colleges actually believed communism worked, aged today?Brilliantly. If I say so myself. If anything the film works better today than it did in 1985.For starters the film itself is timeless. Nothing about the film gives away the date that it was made. Only the fact I know who John Hurt and Richard Burton are gives a hint to time period. The film itself could have been released in theaters last week.Since the film comments heavily on torture in its last act and on “Big Brotherism” throughout, if released today it undoubtly would be seen as a direct attack on both the Bush administration and the British Labor government. In fact many scenes are a clear attack on the Bush administrations torture policy and the endless war on “Terrorism”. One could almost never believe the film was about communism at all. Modern audiences today would laugh at such a quaint notion. With few exceptions I have never known a film so timeless. Heck it is one better than simple timelessness. It is actually more relevant today than when it was made. The idea of government using an endless indefinable and unwinnable war to curtail its subject’s freedoms is right from today’s headlines; whether you are discussing the war on drugs, terrorism, or global warming the results are the same. All the good intentions in the world simply mean less freedom for you and your children. “For the greater good” no less.Orwell would be shocked at the creativity governments today would use to curtail peoples freedoms and lives. Or perhaps he wouldn’t and that is why his story is so timeless and most remarkably the film based on it is as well. Oh and the film is fun with a brilliant and perfectly cast John Hurt in the primary role as the put upon and tortured everyman. Richard Burton, not chewing scenery for once, in a role with gravitas; his last I believe. Also super cute and believable Suzanna Hamilton who looks like a real woman both in and out of her clothes as the love interest and the catalyst for desire of change. And a special kudos to a fantastic direction by Michael Radford and production design by Allan Cameron.

44,rebeljenn,Good portrayal overall but has its flaws,2,15 February 2006,"'Ninteen Eighty-Four' is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted. It is a very dark film, and it is one that will not make you feel good about yourself. It is about a romance taking place in this society and the betrayal of the lovers and about human nature being self-centred. The film has some very good ideas and is done well in portraying this society with the dark tones in colours (contrasting with happiness and bright colours in the dreams) and a general feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places. However, despite the film's cleverness at portraying this idea, the film was very slow and did not seem to quite get the idea across. It seemed to spend too much time being clever rather than telling a story.",1984

47,Bababooe,Very slow and boring for most part. Best to see the 1954 British TV version with Peter Cushing. 84 version is a disgusting joke.,1,23 September 2017,"I read the book many years ago. I remember the main plot but forgot the ending. The only other thing I recall is that they raised the price of chocolate from 25 to 30 and Winston had to rewrite the history and state they're reducing the price from 50 to 30.Richard Burton was great but seriously underused. Excellent voice and delivery. John Hurt did fine, mostly towards the end. He's a fine actor, the problem is in the script and direction. Suzanna Hamilton was decent, not great. A few other minor characters, did not add anything to the film.Visually it was OK, not great. At times it looks like a cheap TV movie. There was some atmosphere in the film, but not all the way through. A lot of cheap scenes. Everybody praises the cinematography. I can't. It looked OK. Nothing great. A few days ago I rewatched The Shining. That has great cinematography. I would also recommend Messiah of Evil for great camera work. 1984 cinematography was OK at best. The music was OK, annoying at times. The dialogue was mumbled and hard to understand at points.Now, onto the story. We don't get a good idea what is going on. We know this is in a future time when 3 world powers are at war, and the people are brainwashed. But we don't get a full picture of Hurts character. We see some backstory of his mother and sister, and a scene with a prostitute. We see him at work rewriting history. But these scenes are very boring and it's all cheap TV show format. I'm reading other reviews now. One critic mentioned that when Winston went into the proletarian area he didn't look too cautions or paranoid, like he did in the book. He just came and went like it was normal. Apparently in the book things were more stark, and he would have been more cautious in this area of town.I've seen this movie years ago on TV and don't remember it much. Watching it yesterday I was thinking, OK, this is fine, but I saw the deficit in it. It is very slow, and boring. I will now need to reread the book.Worth checking out, if you read the book. If not, I would not recommend it. As it is my rating is 4 stars, maybe a C. The problem is the director. He also wrote the script. I do not recommend directors, write and produce their own films. No checks and balances.OK, after watching this mess of a film last week, I viewed 3 other versions and rewatched this yesterday. The 1956 US film. The best Peter Cushing 1954 British TV version. And the 1953 US TV version. All of the previous versions were superior to the 1984 mess. Simply put everything was better, from the script and the acting to cinematography, costumes, music, directing, dialogue, story, and comprehension of what the hell is going on. I recommend watching all versions to compare. I don't know why John Hurt is elevated to such heights. He was a decent actor but give me a break. The best version of Winston Smith was Peter Cushing. The Eddie Albert 1953 and Edmond O'Brien 1956 also acted well, much better than Hurt. I thought Richard Burton as O'Brien did well until I checked out the other versions. Best was Andre Morell 1954 against Cushing, he was cool and calculating. Lorne Greene 1953, and Michael Redgrave 1956 were also good. I thought the best Julia was Norma Crane 1953. But Yvonne Mictchell 1954, and Jane Sterling 1956 did well. Suzanna Hamilton 1984 was OK, but the worst, the only thing she did well was when she took her clothes off. That just doesn't make the film. Donald Pleasence as Syme in the 1954 version was excellent. Great stuff. Gregor Fisher as Parsons in 1984 version was a complete joke, what a mess. All the Charringtons did well, but the best was 1954.Not having read the book in so long, I cannot comment on the differences with the book. But after watching the 4 versions available, I saw what the 84 version missed on. The meeting at O'Briens home, the previous versions had Julia accompany Smith, this one didn't and it was much shorter. There was some intense dialogue in the earlier versions. When Charrigton enters the room towards the end, this version is shorter, the previous versions had more impact. Gratuitous nude scenes. At the end one of the thought police gut punches Julia. I wonder who thought this was a good idea? The torture scene in this one was ridiculous, repetitive nonsense. There was more impact in the older versions.So, my revised rating is a D or 3 stars. For balance for all the praise given I will give 1 star. This movie is a joke. It looks disgusting. The flashback scenes of Smith as a kid and then visiting a prostitute, all add up to a bunch of crap. Missing information, the audience is left to read the book, or just be awed by the visuals, which is honestly not that impressive. Zero chemistry between Smith and Julia. This director wrote the screenplay. Big Freaking Mistake. Maybe he should have viewed the other versions. Or, how about reading the book. Or, maybe get a professional screenwriter, rather than try to slap some stupid scenes together that make no sense. Forget the D, this is an F.",1984

49,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,John Hurt Memorial Review of 1984,7,3 December 2018,"Having grown up part of the original STAR WARS generation, it's impossible to not connect that story with even the most popular of classic futuristic novels that, in this case, proceeded the science-fiction phenom by decades. The question is: Would The Dark Side consider themselves The Dark Side? In their minds, they're right, not wrong... Right? Pure Light, not the absence of light...In the 1984 version of the George Orwell adaptation of 1984, despite being purposefully overboard to capture the essence of symbolism, it's difficult to find anything lucrative about this particular totalitarian government in which most of the people are forcefully, methodically content...The dilapidated streets resemble bombarded post-War Germany, and on giant movie screens is the image of a man that looks like Adolf Hitler, somewhat, and there's no turning off the repetitious propaganda ranging from battle front updates to how much chocolate will cost ""next week."" Meanwhile, the people confess their ""sins"" to the leader and to ""Big Brother,"" especially those who have read a book by a man named Goldstein (no, he doesn't play basketball at Carver High): his philosophy attempts to delete this horrendous future with no value whatsoever. Hell, there's not even a cool red lightsaber.The movie, though, does have value, especially in the inspired casting of John Hurt as a man who looks part of the decaying exterior but with a subtle hope within a glimmer of his pale, baggy eyes, but that only we notice upfront, and yet, in the crowd, he blends right into the ragged woodwork...On a personal basis, relating to the character, by keeping a diary and having an affair with a beautiful young woman, he's more an independent thinker than he should be, or that he has the right to be in this New World Order. And writing this review in belated memorial of John Hurt's January 2017 passing, 1984 was, at the time, Richard Burton's last role before his death following the film's release. His part mostly takes place during the third act when Hurt's Winston Smith is tortured until he sees what he's supposed to see, not what he really sees...This part of the movie is rather slow, which is probably intentional. While we get a bellyful of the kind of propaganda citizens are force-fed with those screens that never turn off, the ""Big Brother is watching you"" aspect isn't as played out... at least not up front... to gain momentum and suspense. Rather, it's an ingrown ""vibe"" throughout...What's mainly centered on for the story's metronomic buildup is Winston's job inside a large gray office building: he rewrites history to suit the constant, word-spoken headlines. Like Phillip Kaufman showed the inside-out of how the Pods take over the world, in his own remake of a 1950's sci-fi thriller, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, director Michael Radford effectively shows the mechanics of this particular society to follow the monotonous chore of the leading character. Through John Hurt's Winston we learn everything about the masses. Or, more fitting, the mass.The best scenes take place during this first half where the scenery resembles a post apocalyptic yarn where a loner wanders around and, through grainy perspective, the audience can firsthand witness the ruins of a dead society gasping for breath...Reportedly, on set, Burton could hardly remember his lines. In fact, his mental state was already known during pre-production, so the director initially didn't want him on board at all. If he was, in real life, somewhat ""out of it,"" it wound up alright since the character has been programmed enough to be robotic by his own standards - despite the fact he does have an bit of intellectual, serpentine charm. Burton is known for his voice, and he's indeed The Voice here, providing an 11th hour exposition that derails the only break the film offers to the ongoing slow-burn punishment of the senses...That being Winston's affair with Julia, played by Suzanna Hamilton, bringing a surge of life to both the leading character and to an audience that, after a while, starts feeling completely part of the purgatory of this dilapidated, false utopia: In that... despite the sporadic use of shortcut arthouse imagery, and a diary narration serving those who read and reread the novel., 1984 The Movie succeeds and yet, between the lines, somewhat fails to stand completely on its own.",1984
50,chaswe-28402,Describes the past; reveals the present; predicts the future,10,3 October 2018,"Hurt's the word. Highly effective dramatization of the novel, which is itself based on numerous antecedents: Koestler, Huxley, Zamyatin, Wells, and others. I read this book in 1949, aged 12, and I don't suppose many viewers aren't familiar with it. Perhaps those that haven't read it have a right to feel a little bewildered. However, if they haven't read the book they don't really have any right to an opinion. It's in today's DNA, as they say. Burton is good, Hamilton is good, Cusack is good, Radford and Deakins are good. Hurt is great. All depressing.

51,rocknrelics,Impressive,9,10 June 2021,"I don't know why I've never watched this before, although thinking about it, perhaps the sheer terror of having to experience a soundtrack by Eurythmics was the deciding factor in me giving this one a swerve.So, anyway, I decided I wanted to see it, and purchased the Criterion blu ray, as that gave me the option of the orchestral soundtrack rather than the pop one, and now having watched the film, I cannot for the life of me, see how a pop soundtrack would suit this film at all.The first thing that strikes you is the sense of misery that pervades from the very start, partially the colour palette, but there's something else too that I can't explain, but whatever it is, it's captured.The sense of dread continues throughout, and there are superb performances from all concerned. I won't go into the detail of the story, but I came away from this breathless and feeling like I'd experienced a film, not just watched it.The Criterion disc looks superb, the mono sound is the only disappointment, and you do really have to crank up the volume to get a good sound, but it's definitely the version to go for as the UK disc only has the Eurythmics soundtrack.I feel this film should be better thought of than it seems to be. Highly recommended.",1984
52,CineMuseFilms,A dystopian masterpiece where alternative facts and fake news are weapons to crush truth,8,5 April 2017,"When a US Presidential spokesperson recently used the term alternative facts to explain away inconsistencies between the White House version of truth and objectively verified truth it triggered a global revival of interest in the George Orwell classic Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949). Single- handedly, the term alternative facts caused a run on the 68-year old novel and led to cinemas across America re-screening the 1984 film adaptation. Acknowledged as one of the most important literary works of the modern era, 1984 has been adapted to film, television, radio, stage, music, and other popular culture platforms and it continues to resonate as a contemporary dystopian warning about how power can be used as a weapon to crush truth.The film's plot line, setting and acting are starkly minimalist. Oceania is an imaginary futuristic totalitarian society that is in ruins from perpetual war. The people are under constant surveillance and there are screens everywhere broadcasting propaganda that keeps the masses devoted to leader Big Brother. The Party controls everything, including human thought and the facts of history. The masses must publicly demonstrate their loyalty to Big Brother, personal relationships are banned, and any ideas contrary to Party Policy are thought-crimes punishable by death.The film's protagonist, Winston Smith (John Hurt), is a nondescript Party apparatchik whose job it is to review historical documents and insert alternative facts to suit ever-changing Party policy. He scans newspapers and books for items officially deemed 'fake news' and expunges the record. Anyone who has contradicted Party policy has their entire identification ""vaporized"" as if they never existed. Amidst this dystopian oppression, Winston knows that what he is doing is wrong but is powerless to act until he meets a likeminded worker called Julia (Suzanna Hamilton) with whom he can discuss his innermost thoughts. Their illegal affair is uncovered by the Thought Police and senior Party figure O'Brien (Richard Burton) tortures Winston, ultimately re-programming his brain so he can believe contradictory facts and opinions.This is a film rich in metaphor and ironic distortions. The key institutions of Oceania exist solely to manufacture 'fake news' and to psychologically manipulate the will of the people. The Ministry of Truth produces endless falsehoods and historical revisions while the Ministry of Love specialises in torture, brainwashing and executions. The Ministry of Peace ensures that war is constantly waged against vaguely defined enemies to keep the masses from complaining about the food shortages that are disguised as surpluses by the Ministry of Plenty. The Party succeeds by controlling the only accepted language called Newspeak, the sole purpose of which is to minimise vocabulary so people cannot articulate their own memories because the words no longer exist. With memories gone and facts invented, Party control is complete.In terms of contemporary cinematic standards, 1984 stands up exceptionally well for a film made 33 years ago. The principal actors are brilliant in depicting an expressionless and alienated existence. The late John Hurt had the rare ability to express his thoughts entirely through terrified eyes that stared blankly from an impassive face and he used this to full effect in some truly frightening scenes. Excellent cinematography conveys the claustrophobia of a world diminished by totalitarianism. The use of a desaturated and depressive colour palette creates vivid contrasts with scenes where Winston imagines what the real world must have looked like.Some may wonder how the depicted extreme nihilism of Orwell's 1984 can have any relevance to politics today. While the dystopian world that Orwell predicted has not materialised in a physical sense, his warnings about the manipulation of truth and political corruption are entirely prescient. The fabricated worlds of alternative facts, fake news, and policy spin are corruptions of modern political life and their threat to civilised discourse can only be contained by the power of language to speak the truth.",1984
53,blackmamba99971,George's best work,10,14 April 2010,"A great novel to film version I have ever seen. A totalitarian government using the ordinary people to thrust forwards a new world coalition under subterfuge means. Richard Burton was magnificent in his role as a lap dog for this new world order. And John Hurt the lowly man who is employed by a censorship board, only wanted to live in his own solace without the need for military interruptions. George Orwell captured the horrifying vision of how our own political bodies are becoming so corrupt, that even the common man and woman will not survive an oncoming slaughter to those who built the nations from the ground up using toil and sweat. This film had a vision which no other can match, cities nearly burned to the ground, ordinary civilians living in horror day by day, and children trying to survive by scraping the streets for food or eating virus ridden rats. The paraphrase, Big brother is watching you is not really that far behind us, and this movie captured it precisely. One of the greatest film achievements of all time.",1984
54,room102,"one of the best novel-to-screen adaptions ever made, for the best novel ever written",10,22 October 2002,"Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984) is, in my opinion, one of the best novel-to-screen adaptions ever made, for the best novel ever written (and don't get philosophized with me about ""the other book"", because I don't believe in god ;) ).If you've read the book, you already know that you should expect a very depressing movie. And indeed, this is one of the  most depressing movies I've ever seen (yes, it's even more depressing than Dead Ringers). I guess that might explain why this astonishing gem is so underrated. So underrated that, as far as I know, it hasn't been released on DVD (only on VHS and LaserDisc).Another reason (apart from being a very non-commercial and non-mainstream movie) is that the book is quite hard to ""get"". The way I see it, everyone sees and understands something else from it. The ""outer layer"" is a political satire and most people see it only as a ""negative prophecy"". But for me it's a much more complicated creation, which works on so many levels. It deals with the basic and most important issues in life, society, government, wars, religion, education, brain-washing, the place of the individual, the hardship of being alone (physically and mentally), the concept of holding two contradictious thoughts at the same time, the position of the individual in history, the nothingness of being human, love, family, loyalty and betrayal, the instinct of any animal in nature to survive, and so much, much more.Being so complicated, I think it's impossible to bring all the concepts of the book to the big screen (""Naked Lunch"", anyone? Heh, maybe Cronenberg should have handled 1984 too). So don't expect to find everything in the movie (this is the point to mention that several minor changes were made for the movie). If you like it, I recommend you to read the book. I think that together they ""complete"" each other, in the sense that the former ""brings life"" to the latter: When I read the book (at least 4 times by now) I ""see"" and ""hear"" the characters as they appear in the movie. I can't imagine how the reading would be without it.Back to the movie, which, by the way, was shot on exactly the same dates (up to the day!) and locations as imagined by author George Orwell. It stars John Hurt, my favorite British actor, in what might be his best performance ever. Very few actors can give so much realism to such a demanding and difficult role (especially the torture scenes).This is also Richard Burton's last movie, and it's dedicated to him. Burton is excellent in his role, and his casting is perfect. His voice and speeches will stay with you for a very long time.All the other actors are excellent too: Suzanna Hamilton as Julia, Gregor Fisher (which you might recognize from the TV Bean-like comedy ""The Baldy Man"") as Parsons, Cyril Cusack as Charrington, and more.
Dominic Muldowney did a fantastic job with the music and songs, and the Eurythmics contribution works well here, especially Annie Lennox's heavenly voice (but keep their CD-soundtrack aside - it's so much different from the movie's atmosphere, except for the end-credits song, ""Julia""). Muldowney's score, titled Nineteen Eighty-Four - The Music of Oceania, was finally released in 1999. It's 54 minutes long and contains 24 tracks.
Roger Deakins' cinematography and film-processing is excellent, giving the film the required atmosphere and aging look.And of course, Michael Radford, who also made the adaption, directed the movie flawlessly.Well, if you read this review up to here, you understand how good I think the movie and novel are. I can't recommend them enough. But be warned - both are extremely depressing and require a lot of thinking. Oh, don't read it in any language other than English!10/10",1984

The only thing this movie didn't predict is that it was the most affluent societies that would be the most repressive (The U.S. has the most number of prisoners and the highest incarceration rate in the world).

56,deanofrpps,Oceania: Dick Chaney's Homeland,8,23 April 2006,"George Orwell writing in 1948 gave us the flip side of Britain future: absorbed by Oceania (presumably the us) it acts as an airstrip in the eternal wars of the super-states East Asia Eur-Asia and Oceania. We find Winston Smith at his desk in Mini-truth rewriting the past. Led by Big Brother, a shadowy image on the telescreen which broadcasts official propaganda and spies on the citizenry, Oceania is whipped into a paranoid state. Because of the never-ending wars, subversion pervades Oceania, particularly a noxious liberal democrat named Goldstein. But in the course of re-writing the archives, Winston discovers that the real leaders of The Revolution have long since been vaporized. The image of Big Brother merely is generated by the political structure running Oceania through technologically disseminated paranoia.Thus Winston embarks on a journey down the twisted corridors in search of The Truth. What is the Truth? 1984 is of particular pertinence in our times in which the US has become the mirror image of Oceania, replete with a real life Big Brother, a roly-poly little man who runs off in crisis but smiles for the camera.If George Orwell qualifies as a latter day prophet for having accurately seen much of the future there is one small detail Orwell may have missed: He never saw that the cardboard cut out Big Brother could be such a coward.",1984

I've heard it's great and explores some really cool concepts, but still I haven't read it. This film adaptation explores some of the ideas the book does, but in a way that makes to almost incomprehensible to understand for someone who hasn't read the book. My dad understood it just fine, he wanted to show me the film when I saw him because he liked the book so much, but without having read the book I was left bored and lost.The cinematography is beautiful and there are multiple moments during the second act which just blew me away with how stunning they were, due to contrast from what we are mostly shown, if you've seen the film you know what I'm talking about. Roger Deakins is the director of photography so no surprises in the cinematography department.There is a fairly lengthy torture scene that takes up the majority of the third act that was not presented well. By this sequence I didn't care about the characters or the story so I found this scene to be extremely boring and unnecessarily slow. It's not even very brutal which would have made me enjoy it a bit more.The screenplay is pretty bad. The dialogue isn't interesting and it felt like many exposition scenes were cut as nothing is explained enough for someone who hasn't read the book.I mentioned that there is a really so scene towards the end of this film, but that's not the only one. I felt every scene was unnecessarily slow, I love slow films (just look at my ratings) but when nothing happens in these very extended scenes it ends up feeling like a waste of time.

59,TheCorniestLemur,Keep in mind this is based on one of my favourite books,7,18 September 2020,"I'm a little biased going into this, because the book is one of my all-time favourites, even though I really do not consider myself a particularly big fan of ""classic literature"" aka all that boring stuff you were made to read in high school English - you know the type I mean. Regardless, I think the book is utter genius, so this film certainly has an easy advantage there.And for the most part, it's a faithful adaptation, and so the story remains genius.
My biggest problem in terms of this being an adaptation is something that is likely unavoidable, that being that there is a LOT of thought-tracking in the book that would be largely impossible to replicate in a film, which means that the characters are inevitably less fleshed out here. Julia is easily the one that suffers the most from this - I would argue she's just flat out boring, in fact.
The pace does also drag around the middle somewhat, but everything else I can't really complain about as a fan of the book.All the performances are great and the casting is pitch-perfect, Roger Deakins is...well, Roger Deakins, so of course the film looks excellent, and by excellent, I mean the most miserable looking thing I've ever seen, and my god does it capture Orwell's world perfectly.

I have since forgotten about it until a friend mentioned it to me recently and was lucky enough to find an unedited version of the film on my Encore movie channel package on satellite TV.The opening sequence was enough to suck me in. It's a movie that reminded me of the Half Life video games, dark, dystopia's living conditions, and the residents are conditioned to believe its normal to live that way. The film also reminded me of ""Metropolis"" (1927) since the plot was similar in some ways. The elite control the working class and eventually begin to take advantage of their power, causing one man and woman to rebel as quietly as they can. Even love making is an act of rebellion and Big Brother's eyes are everywhere. There are curfews, and waking calls. Synthetic food and rations, making you wonder if this Totalitarian way of life could have happened if WW2 ended differently.The book was written in 1949 and I have never read it..yet. I wonder if Orwell really thought that this scenario he painted was a ""What If"" scenario. The atmosphere and propaganda during the early 40s are included into his story and Nazi Germany was very much like the state of civilization depicted in 1984 except that it continued 45 year into the future, a parallel time line depicted in detail. Haunting music accompanies the emotional acting, large epic sets, and the film put images in my mind that are hard to forget.

That makes it an interesting, studious revisiting of the famous Orwell classic.It is surprisingly dark, gritty, and uncompromising in its depictions of the dystopian Oceandia, where a Totalitarian government abuses freedoms for control and power.

John Hurt plays the renowned role of Wilbur Smith, a citizen who defies conventions, and questions what he is told. But he's a convincing fraud. Reacting appropriately to the propaganda rallies by saluting and hollering when expected, working his day job without complaint, he dreams of a world where people are free to do and think what they like. Stunningly acted, with the double whammy of both Hurt and Richard Burton in the power acting stakes, this is visually, emotionally and artistically sumptuous. The environment is atmospheric and compelling - whilst the ever present propaganda narrative spouts the successes of the party in the war with Eurasia, everywhere the eye looks is dereliction, decay and despair. The music is bombastic, a clarion cry to the masses to follow their great leader. The acting is simply jaw-dropping, the script excellent, and the direction sublime. I'd like to write more about the parallels between Orwell's concepts and the way Western civilisation seems to be headed, but I'd need a whole other website.A wonderful, wonderful piece of cinema.",1984

65,tamsin-parker-262-538925,"Not a perfect adaptation, but a great one.",7,11 September 2020,"There is no full-frontal male nudity, but at least three instances of full-frontal female nudity. This seems unfair and objectifies women, if not to the extent of 'Pink Floyd: The Wall'.
Julia is still a strong character, but the film cuts out some of her political views that were explained in the book, such as the fact that she suspects the bombs were not Eurasian planes but Eastasian. She was objectified in some way, but the book still emphasised what a complex character she was.
The film also cuts out the moment where O'Brien tricks Winston into ""confessing"" that he would kill and betray to resist the Party. That was a brilliant moment and I'm disappointed it was left out.
The 'Oranges and Lemons' part, an important subplot in the book, seems to go nowhere.Still, the film is powerful. Great visuals, great acting, great editing, great sets. John Hurt brings Winston to life and almost got me to care about him. When I read the book, I didn't care about Winston. I thought he was unsympathetic and misogynistic. But maybe he never needed to be. Hurt has a powerful screen presence. Suzanna Hamilton is perfect as Julia; intelligent, curious, desperate and quietly defiant. Richard Burton wasn't quite how I imagined O'Brien to look but he was great anyway.It's far from a perfect adaptation of the book. But it is a great one.",1984
66,dkncd,Watch Big Brother,10,7 October 2007,"""1984"" is an adaptation of George Orwell's well-regarded novel of the same name. The film is set in a hypothetical future Britain (called Oceania) where the ultimate totalitarian regime, led by the ""Party"", is in control. The story follows Winston Smith, who is a lackey within the Party's Ministry of Truth and alters records to support official doctrine. The Party expects no less than perfect loyalty to the mystical leader of Oceania, Big Brother.The world of Oceania is appropriately dingy, taking its cue from Orwell, who wrote that the world of Oceania had improved technologies for surveillance and communication but regressed otherwise. All of the technical details of Oceania were well-developed from the view screens with faded color to the tubes used to pass messages in the Ministry of Truth. Even music is used effectively to create the atmosphere of Oceania.This film is perfectly cast. John Hurt was an apt choice to play the downtrodden yet curious and creative Winston Smith. Suzanna Hamilton is refined and sensual as Julia and the relationship between her and Winston is made realistic. Richard Burton is likewise well-cast to portray the two faces of O'Brien, who can be genial or disturbingly and zealously methodical. Another notable performance comes from Gregor Fisher as the overwrought man Parsons.Having read ""1984"" before seeing this, I appreciated how closely this film followed the story. The grimness and tension of Orwell's novel is captured vividly in this film. Some people may find this film too bleak, but I appreciated that no compromises were made to make this a more cheerful story. Like Orwell's novel, this film is depressing but always compelling.",1984
67,Mikew3001,Great movie adaption of Orwell's drama,10,4 September 2002,"This version of George Orwell's famous social fiction book ""1984"" from 1948 is a brilliant adaption with great actors. Shot in and around London between April and June, 1984 (exactly the place and time where the plot takes place in Orwell's novel), it shows the horror vision of a disturbed and military future with no space left for individualism, criticism, love, sex and feelings. All thoughts and actions are controlled by the ""big brother"", an all-present spy- and camera-system, and it resembles the atmosphere of the German Third Reich, settled in a bleak post-industrial war zone.The photography is brilliant, with typical dirty 1980's industrial design and destroyed and grey landscapes. The minimal electronic sound track by Dominic Muldowney and the songs by the Eurythmics add more dark atmosphere to the hostile surroundings and the disturbing plot. The best about this movie are the actors, especially John Hurt as tortured individualist Winston Smith who turns to a mind-controlled ""puppet on a string"", and Richard Burton in his very last role as an official, explaining the principles of the totalitarian system to Hurt.

68,schroederagustavo,1984 review,5,17 January 2021,"1984 has features stellar performances by John Hurt and Richard Burton (his last performance) and has beautiful cinematography by Roger Deakins. However, it ultimately fails in capturing the absolute horror, thematic and character depth of the novel, and doesn't really stand on its own. Even though it's fairly loyal to the source material, I never felt it even reached the surface of what the book did for me. Roger Ebert called John Hurt ""the perfect Winston Smith"" and I think that's about right, as he is (by far) the best thing about the film.",1984
69,Jexxon,"A bit too ""bookish""",6,11 January 2005,"Very faithful adaptation of George Orwell's dystopian vision of the ""future"" world of 1984 - perhaps closer to reality today than ever before.The sets and cinematography are minimalistic and sufficiently bleak and gritty, which really evokes the hopelessness found in the novel. The acting is also good (especially Burton), although I felt that Hurt's Winston got a bit too whiny at times.The biggest problem, however, is that the success of the film relies too heavily on the having read the book. There are events and nuances in the performances that are lost compared to the subject matter. In other words, the book is obviously much richer in details and such, and it can't be expected that it's all properly transferred to the screen, but the film doesn't manage to stand on its own. Things from the book could have been added or removed in order to shape it into a better film.As it is now, it never rises above being a visual companion to the novel, rather than being a really good film. The same problem is evident in, for example, the Harry Potter films, that also suffer from this problem. So, in the end it's certainly worth watching, but it's not the wow-experience it could have been. [6/10]",1984

Of course it is not everybody's taste, but anyone must be able to see the acting, filming and dialog excellence of this movie. Richard Burton as the tired O'Brien, John Hurt as Smith and the amazing Julia put out a performance which is totally believable and convincing in every scene.

73,Hup234!,Oceania The Clammy. (But what an anthem!),8,13 September 1999,"Mud, dust, peeling paint and broken windows. Is this what they're fighting for? What a country! But a great screen adaptation, with a perfect cast. =\/= Some thoughts on Dominic Muldowney's  great score, and in particular his wonderful ""Oceania, 'Tis For Thee"" anthem (with David Stewart), which has become a cult favorite. I don't believe the soundtrack has ever been released, which is a wonderment, since it's sought after. The Oceanic anthem itself is heard only instrumentally (at times as an almost-nostalgic solo oboe) until the final credits, at which point the full chorus opens up. But it's not the arrogant song of conquest that Muldowney could have created (boastfulness as a sign of complacency?); it's instead almost a hymn of supplication (to work the masses even harder?). Musically, it doesn't really resolve itself nor stay within an easily-sung-by-the-masses dominant mode (or even remain at the same time signature), but it reaches into ever-searching and unsettled realms, until the final chorus ... which quickly becomes almost a hushed prayer to the monolithic nation.  ""Every deed, every thought, 'tis for thee."" (Notice that accompaniment is mandatory to sing the anthem properly. [Go ahead, try singing it a capella!] Oceania's leadership [who ARE those people, really?] would certainly insist that it be performed correctly and en masse. I think that's what Muldowney was saying. It's masterful work by a fine composer.)",1984
74,jcanettis,Manages to Stay Loyal to The Homonymic Classic Book,8,17 May 2004,"Who hasn't read ""1984"", and hasn't heard about the Big Brother? Despite its more than 50 years of age, George Orwell's all-time-classic book always feels like if it was written today, with its message against the threat of totalitarianism being very strong.The greatest achievement of the homonymic film is that it manages to stay very close and loyal to the book. Although it is in general very difficult to portray a writer's thoughts on the big screen, especially when a complicated and sophisticated book like ""1984"" is concerned, director M. Radford does a very good job indeed: The bleak atmosphere of the not-so-distant future is accurately portrayed, while the characters and the plot remain quite close to what we would expect by reading the book: John Hurt does a perfect job in playing the doomed would-be rebel Winston Smith, while Richard Burton is also very good in his (unfortunately last) role as malicious inner-party member O' Brien, and so is Suzanna Hamilton who plays the character of innocent and promiscuous Julia.In brief, although slightly inferior to the fantastic book, the film still gets a very high grade overall: 8/10.",1984
75,MrVibrating,A great adaptation,8,3 April 2006,"Nineteen Eighty-four has always been one of my favourite sci-fi books. I have read it several times and I still find it relevant even though the time Orwell lived in is long gone. Therefore, I was sceptical to see this movie at first. But my expectations were fulfilled.The story is very neatly moved from paper to celluloid. The plot is not changed at all, although condensed. The basic premises are there, the characters are the same, and quite a few of the scenes follow the book to the letter.The scenery works wonderfully. The dull, grey sets and the propaganda posters are very subtle and portrays the hopelessness of the novel in a great way. The pacing is slow and almost dull, but it actually works even though you have to be able to stand some slow parts.John Hurt and Suzanna Hamilton are great. John Hurt's minimalistic performance is captivating and Hamilton's naturalistic and sleek persona is a good counterweight. As a screen couple, they might not have a lot of chemistry, but that is also correct, this is a dystopian future which suppresses love every chance it gets.Some things are lost in the way though. The idea of newspeak is hardly touched upon and doublethink is not really described. If you, like me, know the book, then this is not a problem. For those who haven't, well, read the book first and you'll get a lot more out of the movie.The ideas are still powerful and valid and we constantly need to be reminded and warned by movies(and books)like this. So do yourself a favour, read the book(it can be found for free at various sites) and then watch this movie.",1984
76,CinefanR,"At least as good as the book, a rare accomplishment",10,26 January 2012,"Here's one of those rare movies living up to the novel. More importantly, the two don't exclude each other. This movie definitely stands on its own, and I found it intriguing enough to make me want more. And so, I read the novel afterwards for additional information. This is the best adaptation I've seen so far – it captures the very spirit of the novel, the impending doom, the desperation.The cast is incredible. Richard Burton doesn't act, he simply IS O'Brien in every single detail. This is Burton's best role in my opinion – so truthful to Orwell's characterization, powerful and effortlessly nuanced. Burton's O'Brian must be one of the most memorable villains of the silver screen, truly frightening and fascinating, suitably enigmatic and brilliant, just like Orwell described him. His chemistry with John Hurt is superb. Hurt's portrayal of Winston is flawless. He inhabits the role, intellectually and physically. Winston's admiration and fascination for his tormentor, his will to survive, his relentless struggle and desire to remember, understand and overcome his condition are palpable in Hurt's outstanding performance. The complexity of Winston-O'Brian relationship is contained in one single look on Hurt's face, in body language. Mesmerizing acting, right there. Orwell's novel is a masterpiece in every aspect, and Director Michael Radford is so smart, he knows that nobody could write those dialogues better than Orwell himself. As a result, the conversations between Winston and O'Brian, as well as many other lines are taken from the novel, verbatim. Those scenes are visceral. Michael Radford's homage to the great writer is complete. The idea of filming ""1984"" on the same date and location indicated by the novel makes it both a product of the 80's AND a timeless creation. The music and the dream sequences, the sets are excellent - everything looks and feels incredibly real, and the viewer gets the taste of genuine terror - the kind of horror that is man-made, the kind that actually happened. This is not science-fiction, dystopia or whatever some people call it, but real history in so many aspects. Only those who have experienced communism first hand in the worst East-European dictatorship will agree that ""1984"" is not far from reality. Not at all, believe it or not. But ironically, as Orwell noted, people do have a short memory, and it's that ignorance that ""They"" are counting on. Yes, it's all true. The ""vaporization"" was actually put into practice by Stalin, and much earlier by the Romans. The manipulation of the language as a means to reshape the perception of reality is, again, no fiction. In my country, the Communist Party tried to eliminate certain words out of the vocabulary specifically for this purpose. Of course, behind closed doors, when there were no neighbors or friends around (informers that is), people were still talking - and that's only because the Party didn't have the technology of Big Brother. During communism, there were these so called ""foster homes"", which were in fact extermination camps for handicapped children (the name of one such center is Cighid, look it up). The ""Re-education center"" from Pitesti, Romania, (known as the ""Pitesti Experiment""), where the treatment of political prisoners between 1949-1952 made O'Brian's methods look like fun and games by comparison, is as real as its victims. The disastrous consequences of forced motherhood in communist Romania (by Ceausescu's decree) surpass by far any dystopian scenario. How about the spiritual genocide of communist propaganda and censorship, inflicted for decades by all possible means? The indoctrination of children starting kindergarten, the food ration and other abominations of the communist regime- these are not Orwellian fantasy, it's historical fact, lived by millions. It's understandable why someone who was born and raised in a democratic society might find these things to be simply unbelievable. Yet it all happened, and Orwell's depiction of totalitarianism is closer to reality than fiction. The ultimate politics manual and a warning for the ages, ""1984"" is alarmingly relevant even in today's ""democracy"". A must-see for everyone, this is Cinema in its finest hour. Watch the movie, read the novel.",1984

If you are lucky you get both.In this case, we are lucky because both the basic story and the basic philosophy were transmitted in this movie.

This movie is essentially just a supplement to the book, brief, rather inappropriate for those who didn't read the novel. Without the knowledge of the novel, the movie can't be fully appreciated.Nearly two hours of depression, frustration, misery, sadness ...

79,raymond_chandler,Gut-Wrenching and Brilliant Must-See Adaptation of Orwell's Masterwork,10,9 May 2016,"Filmed in London during the Spring of 1984, and released later that year. An enormously powerful and chilling adaptation of Orwell's novel. The best translation of a book to screen that I have ever seen.Written in 1948, the novel depicts a society where all but the Inner Party scratch out a meager existence. War is constant, and all goods are rationed harshly. Big Brother is the face of the omnipresent State, which monitors its subjects with large telescreens (two-way TVs). Political orthodoxy is brutally enforced, and no dissent is tolerated.The film stars John Hurt, who is understated and spectacular at the same time. His Winston Smith is a man who has learned to mask his feelings, but he has not succeeded in numbing them. He is a bit too old for the part as written, but it works for the film, with his haggard look suggesting a life of toil and deprivation.>>>SPOILER<<< In his last role, Sir Richard Burton plays O'Brien, the Inner Party member who takes an interest in Winston. He is soft-spoken, polite, and utterly matter-of-fact as he tortures Winston in the final third of the film. These scenes in the Ministry of Love are so brutally realistic that I have great difficulty watching the last part of the movie. >>>SPOILER<<<The original theatrical release (when I first saw it) incorporated songs by the Eurhythmics written just for the film. If you can locate that version, I highly recommend it. I believe their stuff was removed from more recent DVD/Blu-Ray releases, but I am not sure why or which versions.I read the novel in junior high, and was very taken with it.

80,curzon_dax,Disappointing compared to the book,7,21 May 2009,"I read the book (in an excellent audio form but fully) and I found this movie very moody and dark compared to it.It didn't have the 'cyberpunk-ish' feeling of the book which was fast paced and strangely refreshing. This movie is dystopian even in the mood, quite low pace.In addition it gives me the idea that it's very anti-communist while the book was both anti-communist and anti-fascist. I suspect it's affected by 80s Soviet era anti-Soviet propaganda.I say that because the movie starts with a mock up of ""we, the workers, we, the builders"", while that is not stressed in the book at all. In fact, in the book the Proles which are closer to the 'workers' are not even praised. It's the 'middle-lower' class of the outer party that gets the bulk of the oppression according to Winston and common sense.",1984
81,cagebox111,A likely disappointment,2,25 July 2013,"As true with all great books, no film can completely give it justice, but i expected much more than i received. While they do portray an utter sense of helplessness throughout the whole movie, as in the book, they fail to address the more minor details. If I was unfamiliar with the novel I would have been very confused about generally everything. Without proper knowledge of what a telescreen is and its function, how can it make the needed effect? If my memory serves (it should i watched it an hour ago) when Winston rents the room he fails to mention the main reason why he made that purchase, because it had no telescreen to his knowledge. I am almost certain that to people not familiar with the novel it would take multiple viewings to understand what was going on.And that brings me to my three main problems with the movie. Firstly Julia's character is not well developed at all. She tells Winston she loves him when leaving the room they rented after all he essentially said to her was ""I want you"". It is not explained properly why she loves him (a man so much older) or why she, a person who in the book is usually so safe,would bring an almost certain end to her life by taking a foolish risk just for Winston. Secondly, the importance of O'Brien is not fully developed. In the book everything comes back to O'Brien. Not only is he a hope, he is a friend, someone he can talk to whether he be friend or enemy. When O'Brien invites Winston over to his house, a thrilling chapter in the book, it hardly has any effect because the only mention of O'Brien is when the camera shows him in the 2 minute hate and the very opening scene where their eyes meet, which in itself is also not developed. Thirdly and lastly was the point in which the telescreen says something about how Winston's fabricated soldier killed Eastasian troops when it was an exceedingly important detail to the story that Oceania were enemies with Eurasia not Eastasia. That mistake diminishes integrity of the film as it was such a careless mistake that i could not let slip by.In my opinion I did not care for the soundtrack or the sets, but that is just how I feel and will not hold it against the film.To me this film is unwatchable, because of my love for the book. As a non fan of the novel it is still bad because it looses the excitement and the majority of the horror the book conveys.",1984

It has a lot of inaccuracies that people who read the book can spot right way so
imagine the feeling of confusion of someone who never did. The movie lacks a lot of context and explanations and it's only for people who have read the book what I found to be wrong, I shouldn't be obligated to read a whole book in order to understand a movie, the script should've been better crafted and that's why I can't even give a positive rating to this.

83,treadwaywrites,Great Book Adaptation Writing,7,2 February 2009,"Hopefully everyone knows the story of author George Orwell's novel and then the subsequent movie, Nineteen Eighty-Four. Even the cult classic movie Brazil in 1985 has an Orwellian features and themes through the entire fabric of the film. In fact the working title for for the highly futuristic Brazil was 1984 and a half.In the 1984 released film Winston Smith (John Hurt, from 1979 Alien fame) is a worker for the state, one of many whose task it is to literally rewrite history, changing names and events to suit the needs of the will of the Party.  Winston remembers what life was like before Big Brother and loathes what his government has become. He philosophizes about these ideas in private and in a secret journal he hides in the walls of his apartment. Winston begins making eye contact with a younger woman named Julia (Hamilton), and soon the two begin exchanging private notes which in turn leads them into becoming part of the rebellion against the state as their actions are viewed as subversive.This movie follows the book on a much closer level. John Hurt does a wonderful job in the lead. He carries the movie in the direction it needs to go. Unfortunately, the movie didn't make very much money and found itself on a shelf rather quickly. It generally only makes it off the shelf when some poor sap has to write a report on 1984 and they don't want to read the book. Even though the BBC version has the least budget of any film mentioned, it is worth seeing. If you're looking for an exact book copy then read the book. This 1984 movie is okay, worth seeing for John Hurt and Richard Burton who plays O'Brien. In any account with words like Orwellian and Big Brother in the lexicon of American culture, it's best to know where the roots lay.",1984
84,DrPhibes1964,Grim but hopeful,10,6 November 2020,"I have lost count how many times I have read the novel. It is among my favourites. The film is an admirable adaptation. It cannot capture every aspect of the novel, especially the contents of the forbidden book that Winston Smith is given and makes his rebellion against Big Brother and the Inner Party not so solitary. He is led to believe that he has allies in the secret war against these two forces which forced the citizens to live in a state of abject poverty. Everything about this world is dictated by those in control. ""Who controls the past controls the Future: who controls the present controls the past."" It starts when a clock strikes 13. It might not even really be 1984 as Smith speculates in the novel. It is a chilling piece of fiction that is not at all improbable as a democratic society is usurped by a totalitarian regime.The casting is perfect. John Hurt, as one reviewer duly noted, looked like ""death warmed over"". His Winston Smith is far from a hero and never strays far from his literary origins. He is a man physically beaten down by the life he is forced to endure but his mind remains active of hopeful at the defeat of the hated Big Brother. Then into his life comes Julia who shares his loathing of the political system and they begin a forbidden affair. But what is most distinctive about the film is the performance (his last) of Richard Burton as O'Brien. The scenes between him and Hurt are both brutal and astounding.I have yet to see the version wherein the score composed by Annie Lennox (who I just recently learned has a cameo during one of the Five Minutes of Hate rallies) and Dave Stuart which is now available on the recent Criterion Collection release. On various releases the beautiful song Julia can be heard (in part or in its entirety) after the closing credits. I'd be curious to see how the songs blend with the images. Their soundtrack is certainly a product of the 80's electronic pop. It can still be heard fleetingly in a few scenes and creates an eerie soundscape that contributes to be disorienting quality of the film.Despite the rather grim nature of the film there is an ambiguous hopeful quality that might not extend to the characters but the reader (and viewer of the film) takes away some insight into how this world might function.""Everything faded into mists.

I was hoping that I could put an end to a streak of movies that have let me down, but sadly, 1984 let me down in the very same fashion that 'Apocalypse Now' let me down. 1984 is a terrible movie because it is so abstract, so bizarre and so utterly fragmented, that it fails to bridge the gap from fantasy to reality in the mind of a logical thinker. How can one relate to a movie when there is ZERO character development, ZERO plot development, ZERO setting development, etc. There is no storyline whatsoever It's like someone took a 20 hour long movie, and randomly picked random scenes in no particular order, and threw it on film and called it a movie. This is just a horrible movie! They blew it and turned a VERY important subject matter than everyone needs to learn about, and somehow butchered and defiled it into meaningless dross.

I'm 18, so maybe I'm still young and naive. I guess I don't know many things and I haven't seen many things. I read the book three times in original (in English I mean, it's not my native language). I am astonished. I often imagine our future somber and dark. I love movies like Brazil, Mad Max, On The Beach and so on. Post-apocalyptic tales, visions from the future of our world, nuclear nightmares. Warnings. I think that we will be destroyed one day. Destroyed by our own greed, arrogance and self-confidence. And what is sad is that most of the people overlook these warnings. They accept such books and movies as entertainment. They do not see beyond. It's like we all know that we are going towards our doom, but nobody cares to change the direction. If after several centuries a man watches these movies he will probably say ""The bloody bastards knew that it would happen and still did nothing to prevent it. Then we deserve to be extinct..."" At least I hope that we won't be ruled by Apes! A girl from my class heard me once talking about ""1984"". ""This is probably the most stupid and boring book I've ever read!"" ""Like you've read many books in your life"" I thought, but I just said ""In fact it is a deep, profound book. It is a prophecy."" But she continued ""It's just a dull boring book"". ""You just cannot understand this book. It's you who's dull... and you don't even know it."" - I answered. And about the movie. In fact I was a little bit annoyed. If I haven't read the book first I would probably do not grasp the whole idea. The movie is mostly visual performance of some moments from the book. It does not represent the whole idea of Orwell's 1984 world. The audience needs to be familiar with all those things like 3 world powers, telescreens, propaganda and so on. For example when Winston admires the song he says that it is written by a machine, but the woman makes it sound beautiful. And if you are not familiar with the book you'll probably wonder what is this machine, which writes songs. And the movie is full of such moments. The style is good, the costumes too. The sets are very good-looking. But the movie as a whole in my opinion is a number of scenes with no logical linking. Probably the best thing in this movie is the music. My advice - read the book. Then watch the movie, but do not expect to see something unique or great. I want a remake! This story has a great potential and if it is told in the right way it might be a magnificent movie.",1984
87,Essex_Rider,Maybe we're missing the point,10,2 November 2008,"The whole point of 1984 is to show that no matter what the individual wants, the state wishes to utterly control that want or basic human need.I could go on about a faithful translation of book to screen (and it is by the way), and I could say that some aspects of the screen version cannot really explain some of the finer details. But for me, the most terrifying thing is how the individual must love Big Brother before he or she dies.Winston Smith (John Hurt) opens up willingly to the torture inflicted on him, because for most of his life, he has loved and trusted Big Brother, even though he knows, through his position of rewriting history, BB to be false.Yet BB spews out anachronisms that are in constant conflict. Their propaganda tells the party that the orgasm is something to be avoided, yet they have a ministry that promotes pornography to the Proles. They frown on the party workers lack of fitness, yet provide Victory Gin and Victory cigarettes.Sometimes I despair at the parallels with the society of today. Cheap newspapers peddling pornography and propaganda in equal measure, the encouraging of a drinking culture with 24 hour pubs and alcohol cheaper than bottled water in supermarkets. the hijacking of public broadcasters to peddle government propaganda, the list goes on.I rate this film very highly and hope that on seeing it, people open their eyes to the disturbing parallels with 2008.",1984
88,jubilee77,No nonsense Big Brother,8,4 December 2007,"Three weeks before his death, Richard Burton commented to brother Graham Jenkins in response to how his life turned out with frequent appearances in inferior movies asking whether it had all been a waste. His brother's reply was that he had given pleasure to millions and added; ""How can it be a waste?"" Burton choose to carry on with his own thoughts and said; ""Olivier and Gielgud, they've acted in rubbish. We can't be good for all of the time."" ""But there's a difference,"" reminded his brother. ""You've spent most of your life on a film set. Olivier and Gielgud have given more to theatre (theater)."" Burton laughed; ""You mean if the rubbish is on film people remember it for longer."" During 1984 Richard Burton made two final screen appearances in the remake of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty Four along with a cameo role on a made-for-television Ellis Island. Directed by Michael Radford, Nineteen Eighty Four was a gripping and successful remake of the original 1950s version and a no-nonsense approach to Big Brother about a rebel Winston Smith brilliantly played by John Hurt and set in a bleak bloc outpost just like Stalin and the Communist regime with the secret police where people who show the obvious signs of rebellion face torture and worst, execution. Forget about the ""Big Brother"" where people contest on some reality TV rubbish, this is what can happen when your country has been governed from riches to rags with strict Big Brother which suggests that that word is ""Orwellian"" slang for something relating to Stalinism. Richard Burton completed work on 1984 barely two months before his death and he was still at his prime with remarkable performances despite his declining health and he never lived to see the reviews of 1984 for they came out a month after his passing.",1984
89,andy-933-696608,What is the worst thing we are all capable of as human beings?,7,3 November 2013,"When George Orwell's publication of ""1984"" was distributed in 1949, it was not too long after the creation of two separate governments for Korea, as it was divided among the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of the North and the Republic of Korea in the south. South Korea is a moderate presidential republic. North Korea is the very nightmare Orwell's novel depicts. It is totalitarianism to the full definition of its own conception. The 'eternal"" president and the general secretary are Kim LL sung, and Kim Jong LL. Corpses in leadership essentially. The current president is Kim Jong UN, or as Bill Maher often remarks as a member of the Adam's family. Little humor is to be derived from such a comparison, when really pity and sorrow is a more appropriate reaction to the citizens who live under the regime of North Korea, with little freedom, or rarely any individuality in their existence. The same can be said for the people of Ocenia as they praise their ever loving Big Brother, for whatever greater good the party of Insoc (English Socialism) has declared. The details never matter, for the purpose of totalitarianism in its nationalistic intentions is to promote ignorance, and to discourage all forms of independence.Winston Smith (Hurt), a frail, and subtly loner, lives a pathetic and empty life in his methodical existence. His profession consists that of a worker at the ministry of truth, rewriting history, and preventing any essence of truth from reaching the surface of an ongoing war. He attends daily meetings of erratic praise, as many of the blue collared workers of the both the inner and outer parties praise the image of Big Brother, their all powerful and omniscient ruler. There is not a street corner where Big Brother's face isn't shown, or a room with a television screen of his bulgy focused eyes locked dead onto you. Children are recruited into groups known as the thought police, breeding suspicion amongst those they supposed to be thought criminals, as in those who commit the crimes of thinking. Friends, family, neither matters, anyone guilty of thought crime is considered an enemy of Big Brother.Winston's world is forever changed when he receives a letter from a women named Julia (Hamilton), saying ""I love you."" Perplexing at first, and odd to the degree of such a confession, but with the curiosity of his wondering spirit, Winston pursues Julia to the point where they begin a forbidden affair, experiencing the sexual pleasure and the emotional love their society tirelessly works to prevent. As their love affair becomes more intimate, there comes an even greater understanding to Winston and his past, feeling regret for the sins of his childhood, and the doubts he holds to this day in being a human being.One of the central themes of 1984, aside from its direct opposition to nationalistic totalitarianism, is that it is an examination that it tackles both the beautiful and the equally horrible parts of the human soul. Through the character Winston, there comes an unraveling of the certain extents that human nature represents. There are two sides to the fragile and well-meaning Winston. Through his love affair with Julia, comes the gentle and benevolent side that is still discovering the concepts of beauty and happiness, forsaking the absurd notion of purity and embracing the tranquility of an old woman singing as though these were peaceful times. Then comes the cowardly and terrified side to his persona. It is a side that only those that haven't read the novel will find surprising in the dark revelations regarding the human condition. It is mostly shown through the chilling performance Richard Burton gives as O'Brian. A member of the inner party, O'Brian lives a more comfortable lifestyle, being mysterious and cunning in his remarks. He gives Winston dreams of hope, while raising suspicions in the audience. It is a brilliant performance that manifests a cold representation of the human being.Anyone who picks up a copy ""1984"" can merely see written words and images. As a filmmaker, Michael Radford captures the nightmare that George Orwell envisioned, generating a philosophical discussion regarding politics, the manipulation of history, and humanity in is most sensitive areas of understanding. For those who've already read the novel, fully know what happens in the conclusion. Given the film's faithful portrayal of the novel, 1984 distances itself from a typically broad ending, and sticks to the tragic ending that symbolizes the corruptibility of human beings. Winston is lured into the mysterious room 101, and as he is tortured endlessly, he eventually gives in, begging for not only mercy, but torment for Julia. Then and only then does the film truly conceive of the central point, as it causes us to reflect on the part within ourselves that is most vulnerable. Human beings are intriguing creatures indeed, especially in the conception of their capabilities. It is mysterious at times what we are capable of in our willingness, and the film presents that in an atrocious and pitiful form of betrayal, as Winston relinquishes the one he loves most, thus fully capitalizing on the deepest and most deteriorated part of the human soul, the part that is willing to do anything to end suffering, even if it means forsaking the very qualities that grant them the privilege to love. Then and only then does Big Brother truly win. O'Brian said it himself, ""You must love him. It's not enough to obey him. You must love him"".",1984
90,pranderson063095,This Great Book that fails as a movie,4,9 March 2021,Not every great work of fiction as a story is able to keep its greatness when made into a movie. The inner eye and imagination are wonderfully fed when reading (something done more than once). Each time the mental images change. It holds up wonderfully as an audio book narrated by a skilled reader. But the movie simply cannot capture and deliver the same experience. Perhaps those who enjoy the movie haven't actually read the book. That would explain the positive comments were that the case.As a movie the characters as portrayed are nothing like the ones that are shaped in the book by the author. Multi layered in the author's writing but thin and boring in the movie.,1984
91,paul vincent zecchino,"""We Are the Ones We've Been Waiting For"", their favorite year",10,1 July 2011,"Let's put this film on a time line, in manner of good investigators. What was occurring in 1984? Well, President Reagan, having kicked the soviets and Castro back to their respective cages, had just won reelection and it was 'Morning in America'. American's were happy, and freedom was breaking out around the world.The Leftists and their pantie-waist whining chorus were shrieking like a bunch of syphilitic banshees that President Regan would start a nuclear war. He didn't. As for home front, the screaming libs prophesied that President Reagan's pro-gun initiatives would cause 'a bloodbath from coast to coast'. They didn't.Of course, liberals never object to Castro, chairman Mao, pol pot, every crack-brained sadistic mullah and other commie thugs hoarding all the guns, grenades, and nuclear bombs they can get their claws on, do they? Wonder why that is? In 1984, America was free, jubilant, and prosperous, and the soviets, chic-oms, Castro's, and other global pests were nervous. The jihad-Marxist's 'students' who kidnapped and tortured American diplomats in the Tehran Embassy had most astutely realized, with Mr. Peanuts out and President Reagan in, their time was short. Very short. By their own admission. So, they released the hostages. Smart move.So, when this magnificent and prophetic warning in cinematic form was released in late '84, many overlooked it because though the year was 1984, the reality of the film seemed a fading worry from a bygone dark age.Until 2008, that is, when the spoiled-brat leftists who blew their minds on drugs during their 60s heyday returned and brought the dark ages with them, to make their last putsch for global tyranny.This film, based on Mr. Orwell's book, reads like a PET Scan regarding the commie rats and their sadistic, insane, childish, moronic 'philosphy', which consists of to taking functional things of value and destroying them, as well as violating our liberty in order to discourage as many people from living, so as to 'save the planet'.""Nineteen-Eight-Four is also a treatise which tells us how the Left operates. It's a treasure, one the inadequate Left surely can't bear to watch, knowing that history is against them and their idiotic 'revolution'.If you find 1984 to be depressing, you're normal. Communism, socialism, and 'progressiveism' are depressing philosophies founded upon hate. They's why hate pimps like Lenin, Stalin, and crack-brain Marx endorsed it - because the Left is hate.1984 tells us about the Left, in order that we may know it and never again be fooled either by it or the weak minded shills who fall for it.Paul Vincent ZecchinoManasota Key, Florida01 July, 2011milspec390@aol.com",1984
92,TheBillionthGuyNamedJack,A Dystopia Maybe Too Monotone,6,8 April 2020,"1984's world is nothing short of a communist horror but the performances look like they could care less. The world's nature suffers because of this. The movie has the materials to become masterful, the acting drags it down to a point where it unfortunately feels not too different than the world in a non-dystopian film. Sometimes even the film feels more interested in sleazy content than the world. Orwell's dystopian vision could have spun onto the screen if it wasn't for the performances as unmoving as Big Brother's face.",1984
93,bdl7431,Pretty good!!!!!,7,23 February 2006,"The Orwell book is one of my favorites, and I have always enjoyed seeing what happens when someone tries to take good literature and translate it to something that is viewed as opposed to what is imagined from my reading.1984 does not fail to disappoint in this regard. The world that is created has the same run-down feel that one would expect from a war based economy, partly due, if I recall correctly from filming in bombed out ruins from World War II. John Hurt and Richard Burton (his last cinematic role) are quite convincing as Winston Smith and O'Brian, the Party Official.My only complaint with the film is that there seems to be an over-emphasis on the repression of sexual desires. Thus, we see a lot of scenes of Suzanna Hamilton (Julia, Winston's love and political interest) running around without any clothes on. Although being naked is an addition to the film when they are taken by the secret police - it adds to the emotional feeling of vulnerability at being caught - most of it is simply eye candy filler. The 1984 world is far more complicated that simply sexual repression.Also look for Cyril Cusack as Charrington, the shop keeper/secret police officer. I have always liked him since his role as the the fire captain in Fahrenheit 451. He has a very understated acting style that was well suited for this role.Overall a very nice film - not fantastic, but enjoyable. A different ending than the black and white version from the 1950's - which is also quite good - in that in the current version, we are left with the impression that Winston Smith was never truly broken by the political machine, whereas in the earlier version Winston Smith is presented as having surrendered to the political machine.",1984
94,morfeus,A documentary,10,20 May 2006,"Well, this movie cannot be rated as drama of sci-fi anymore, its's a documentary, maybe yet a little inaccurate, but still a factual depiction of reality.We don't have Big Bother, but we have hundreds of political puppets. There is no Inner party, but there are international ""brotherhood"" of wealthy and powerful. Instead of Outher Party, there are politicians and top managers. Instead of perpetual enemy Goldstein, there are non-existing ""terrorists"". There are spy satellites, email scanning, wiretaps, and almost vanished privacy. There's a little of free speech left, and the censorship is strenhtening. The Orwell's concepts of party ""doublethink"" (believing something you know is wrong because the government says so) and ""goodthink"" (believing anything party says and acting only the way government want you to act) is embodied in so called ""political correctness"". There is no Miniluv, but there is CIA and secret prisons and elimination of unwanted dissidents.But most importantly, there is a monopoly on media, which turns 90% of world's population into Orwell's ""proles"", who can never rebel and overthrow the party, because they simply are not informed enough to direct their anger against their government.The book/movie was an early warning, yet nobody seemed to listen, so it seems that we may be doomed to reach the worst end of Orwell's reality.The movie itself is flawless, with powerful acting and directing, but it's not the form it's the message that matters.",1984
95,Skeptic459,Brilliant adaption of a classic novel.,10,30 December 2003,"Despite what one reviewer states here, 1984 is an extremely important literary work. It explains to the reader what the ultimate facist state would be like. This story is never more important than now, with the world in crisis. It is an absolute must that people read or see 1984. Other films have been made about fascism. One of the most notable examples being Pier Pasolini's Salo. But the problem is hardly anyone is going to see that except for weirdo's or film buffs. This is because of the graphic nature of the film. Besides, Salo was explaining the inherently depraved, decadent nature of fascism. Orwell's 1984 explains the mechanisms that invoke totalitarianism. John Hurt is excellent as the main character. I am quite a fan. The film is also very well made. The bleakness of the book is perfectly captured by the director. You feel sympathy for the characters even though they seem far away because they appear so weary, yet willing to hope. Transcendence is hinted at when there is a scene where Hurt looks out and sees a wilderness instead of a prison. Hurt's character, Winston looks like he is about half dead! You really hope that Winston and Julia can pull off a passionate love affair. Although you know that it is doomed and is more of an act of rebellion against big brother than anything else. The setting is a land that is half destroyed because of the constant wars. The wars being yet another method of control. They tell us in psychology that in war, depression and other similar disorders actually go down! Interesting eh?  The start where everyone sits watching the screens and begins to scream at images of the enemy. This is a great moment in the film that shows a kind of utter conformity through extreme social norms. The most effective form of brainwashing.  The problem with the film, like the book, is that people will find it too bleak and horrific to really appreciate it. It is depressing but this is the horror of totalitarianism. The material is not intended to be a walk in the park. One of the most striking and horrific instances of 1984 is the 2+2 does not equal 4 scene. The torture and brainwashing too achieve utter obedience. Richard 'my voice competes with Orson Welles' Burton, who normally pontificates and chews up the scenery is remarkably restrained here. This restraint is the key to a very good performance. These torture scenes are horrific and Hurt really shines. This guy should have got an Oscar! The scenes had me gasping...When I originally read the book it took a while for me to get over the rats. EWWWWWWW! Looking at the overall rating of 1984 I am just totally surprised that this film has such a low rating. Maybe people would rate the novel exactly the same way because of the material. This brings me too my other quibble. The film does not TOTALLY cover all of the novels themes. In fact, although Suzanna Hamilton puts on a good performance, her character is not completely captured. Viewers must remember that literature and cinema are two completely different mediums. There is no such thing as a 100 percent adaption. Therefore you must rate the film on the usual cinematic features. But the main thing is how well the overall message of the story was transmitted. This film powerfully demonstrates Orwell's message!What is weird is one of the reviewers here states that they did not like the nudity. Well, I'm guessing the director was going for a Adam and Eve state with their being naked out in the woods. This is obviously the complete opposite of the unnatural state they have to live in. It does not cheapen the film and points more to the reviewers own repressed desires. Reaction formation perhaps? Besides no one is going to get this for naked bodies when porn is so freely available from your local video store!  Consider how relevant this story is. How propaganda and public relations has never been more prevalent. How public relations has overtaken journalism, causing journalism to become more and more watered down. How the political economy of the media is now being hugely influenced by being based in a monopoly economy. A few now control the flow of information for the general population in western nations. This is not conspiracy theory, this is fact. True investigative journalism is at an all time low and the media itself is in a shocking state of affairs. Like everything in our capitalist system, it is controlled by money. Ever read Michel Foucault? Dominant hegemonies, discourse analysis, bla bla bla. I don't want to get all crusty and academic here. But Rupert Murdoch is rubbing his hands together. Time and time again, the United States has been shown to be patently false about why they engaged in conflict with Iraq. Just read John Pilger! Yet many Americans supported the conflict. Even believing chemical weapons were used on American troops, when no such event took place! Why? Because they were manipulated by a sophisticated propaganda machine.    Knowledge is power. That is why in 1984 language is being systematically destroyed. This denial of language is the denial of thought itself. Reality is then more easily shaped by the oppressor. Remember dictators, such as Pol Pot destroy the educated first. This is why the film and book are so important, they are still very RELEVANT! In fact I think the progression of western society will become a mixture of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and 1984. Either way we are being manipulated and controlled and these books show you how. America has the 'Patriot Act' that was rushed through congress although human rights groups had many serious doubts about the act. In New Zealand we have a Government that is similary becoming too involved in the regulation of peoples lives. BIG BROTHER IS STILL ALIVE!
 I give this film a 10 and think the last scene with Hurt looking so haunted in the bar/coffee place was awesome! GREAT, GREAT BOOK! GREAT, GREAT FILM!
 I have had a bit of a rant here...But hey I really like the book and this version of the film! So why not? This is a film for rebels!",1984

The directing, cinematography and acting all work cohesively to deliver an experience identical to the original story. The sets and props in particular were surprisingly close to what i had pictured in my head while reading the original. Of course, the inherent lack of ability to deliver a new concept can be clearly felt, yet if you have not read the book or are just looking to relieve the experience and vibes, you will not be disappointed.",1984
97,mr composer,Faithful adaptation - maybe too much?,7,22 June 2005,"George Orwell's literary masterpiece ""1984"" is presented with amazing accuracy and detail in this version filmed during the very months of the author's vision. The casting, set design, and atmosphere are all right on the mark for how I envisioned them during reading the book. This film is dark and uncompromising, and follows many of the dialogs verbatim from the book.The flaw in the film, for me, is that I felt like I only enjoyed and understood this movie BECAUSE I had read the book already. There is a theory I once heard and agree with: the closer an adaptation is to the source, the more necessary it is to read the source. A good adaptation is faithful to the essentials of a story but makes necessary changes so that it not only becomes cinematic, yet also becomes something that a viewer unfamiliar with the source material can understand. I think if I were ignorant of the story, there are too many things that would confuse me in this film which the book seems to go out of its way to explain.For example: Who/Where exactly is Oceania? How did the countries go from their current political state to the envisioned one? Why do the people gather in mass and scream passionate hateful exclamations at the screen? What exactly does Winston actually do? Who are the proles? I praise movies that can effectively tell a story without means of voice-over, a much overused device in films. In this case though, I think a little may have helped, not necessarily wall-to-wall, but sparingly used. The movie is effective by being more ambiguous than the book, but I tend to think maybe it is too ambiguous.In summary, read the book if you haven't (either before or after seeing the film) to get a complete overview of the author's vision. With that as a foundation, this really is a good cinematic portrayal, and of a story that is still relevant and not impossible to come to pass. Obviously 1984 is long since gone bye-bye, but 2084 or 2054? Oppression can always come as long as people desire self-centered power and the masses don't pay close attention.",1984
98,stubbers,Silly And Unbelievable,5,30 November 2006,"George Orwell's book is one of the defining literary works of the last century. It's amazing how prescient the book is, although it also proves that today's hot topics of civil liberties, surveillance and the New World Order are really nothing new. As long as there has been politics, there has been the potential for authoritarian states to enslave their citizens and dazzle them by the use of revisionist propaganda. In some ways this was even more relevant to the Nazis and Communists in the 1930s than it is to today's political situations across the world.Although it's true that technology has managed to find new ways of invading people's privacy and making them feel under constant scrutiny, it's conversely true that technology has liberated us to travel more freely than ever before, to learn more than ever before, and to exchange opinions and experiences with those we would never have come into contact with 50 years ago. On balance, I'd say we're further away from Big Brother now than we were at the time of Orwell's novel (an unfashionable view I suspect).Interestingly, it was watching the film of ""1984"" that made me decide Big Brother is further away than I realised. Before seeing the film I was astounded by how accurate George Orwell seemed to have predicted what today's world would be like. The film, however, exposes some of the major flaws in Orwell's premise.To put it bluntly: the innate nature of the inquisitive, rebellious human spirit will NEVER be permanently imprisoned by rogue politicians. They might get away with it for a while, but in the long run the people will rise up and overthrow any regime that pushes them too far. Look at the collapse of the Communist bloc of Eastern Europe in the late 80s. Look at the rise of capitalism in China now, which is slowly but surely bringing new democracy to China. Look at the huge groundswell of public opinion in the US and the UK which is firmly anti-government. People in both countries are utterly cynical and sceptical of their politicians, and certainly don't live in fear of speaking their minds. I'm free to write this, aren't I? Oh hell...who's that knocking at the door???Quite frankly, none of the characters in the movie have any charisma, humour or humanity whatsoever, which makes them one-dimensional and unbelievable. The film looks dated and unscary. There is very little suspense at all and too much generic dystopian-imagery-by-numbers.My favourite part of the novel was the manifesto which Winston was given that spells out the principles of the government. This to me is the crux of the book, more than the plot line itself. Unfortunately, the dry Newspeak language of the manifesto simply does not lend itself to dramatisation. The Room 101 scene was better, but even then it seemed unrealistic and over-stylised rather than psychologically terrifying.On the upside, the acting performances were OK in an artsy type way, and the music by the Eurythmics was excellent. I'm glad I watched this film, but I don't think it does the novel any favours...it just makes the land of 1984 seem like a bad dream rather than a plausible reality. Which wasn't the point!",1984

Although it is regarded as a ""classic"" I could barely remember anything about it, so I went into this movie ""fresh"". I came out of it disheveled and drained, and not in a good way. The very definition of bleak. I have experienced other movies that are depressing yet powerful, and they remain in my memory as worthwhile movie experiences.

Before seeing the movie the other night I had convinced myself that it would be even more relevant in that it surely had to be about the capitalism/fascism mess we know live in. It isn't. It simply makes the point that individualism could be stamped out and that it could make for a very dire existence if the oppressor were as bad as one could imagine. I will have to reread the book.. maybe it is deeper than the film suggests.Very atmospheric and economical filmmaking really. Great performances. GREAT NUDITY.. is this sense. The woman playing Julia is lovely, in a very ordinary way and to see her so exposed,quite hirsute in fact, is a revelation to one about how beautiful human beings can be.

103,Adec,Truly Intelligent sci-fi...,9,15 August 1999,"1984 is a serious, thought provoking, highly intelligent piece of seminal sci-fi that has lost none of its power in translation from print to screen and the basic story so brilliantly realised by George Orwell in 1948 is just as relevant today as it ever was.Writer/director Michael Radford has done a remarkable job capturing the bleak world as dreamed up by Orwell and portraying it on the screen. His script adaption of the story is truly worthy of the source material, in fact this adaption to screen is so faithful that many may be put off by it's relentless bleakness and sense of despair and hopelessness as presented by Radford (and as originally conceived by Orwell), but those willing to take this journey will be rewarded with a truly powerful film experience unlike just about anything committed to film previously or since.The acting is superb on all accounts, with John Hurt and Suzanna Hamilton both perfectly cast as the lovers seeking comfort in each others arms despite the fact that their very love is punishable by torture and execution, however the best performance of the film comes from the late Richard Burton (in his final screen role) as the calmly menacing O'Brien who managed to seem both chilling and human and the same time. In fact Burton's performance here is both a mesmerizing tour de force and a lasting testament to his skill and talent as an actor. Also special note must be made of the wonderfully surreal music by Eurythmics and Dominic Muldowney that fits into the atmosphere of the film seamlessly.For those unafraid of the downbeat and who appreciate great film making without the need for action, laughs or happy endings then I wholeheartedly recommend this film without hesitation. Utterly superb.One man's opinion. 9.5/10",1984
104,wyplmaa,My rating has nothing to do with the movie itself,10,1 September 2021,"This movie is prophetic to say the least. The scary part of watching this movie isn't the movie, its the fact that today's Democrat Party is an exact likeness of those who feel it is their right to control every thought, every move of the populace. If you watch the news on a regular basis, with your mind open and not closed, you can clearly see the totalitarian mindset of those in the media and the democrat party along with the many rino republicans that inhabit the Republican party. They use deflection to slander those who disagree with their policies and twisted world view. If they accuse you of something, remember, it is because they are guilty of what they accuse you of. 10 stars, a must watch for those who are truly ""AWAKE""(not to be confused with the sleeping ""Woke"").",1984

About the movie, it follows the book so literally, that someone who hasn't read the book probably feels lost very soon. It is hard to understand, just seeing the film, the real situation of fear, misery and total mind control that the characters are suffering. I must say that all the atmosphere, and even the actors, are very similar to what I imagined when I read the book. Just Julia is a bit tasteless, you simply can't see her as the fierce but ice-cold resistant against brain washing. I have read the book four times, and probably seen the movie three or four times, too, and I still feel the anxiety and agony of Orwell's world. Nevertheless, a previous knowledge of the book is recommended",1984

Unfortunately, I watched a disappointing movie. Now, that's not to say there weren't well-done aspects of the movie. I think that the set design was well crafted and pretty faithful to the book. I believe that John Hurt's acting was truly invigorating to watch. However, all of the other actors didn't come close to Hurt's acting. I was shocked at how Richard Burton was underacting. I also believe the movie felt way too short despite the runtime of the movie being 110 minutes. It felt like 80 minutes. The pacing for the movie also felt very sloppily done. Apparently, the director had problems with the score. I didn't find it to be bad. I didn't find it to be good either. There was only a couple of scenes in which I felt the score felt out of place, but overall, I was shocked and saddened with how disappointing the movie was.",1984

However, I don't think I would have understood the premise of the movie if I hadn't already read the book. The movie is a noble attempt to show the despair of people trying to break the bonds of overpowering government rule, but the book portrays the suffering much more thoroughly. The corrupt government officials have comfortable, almost luxurious lives, while the common people struggle to obtain the bare necessities for survival. Perhaps most people feel this way toward their leaders and rulers regardless of whether or not they are actually oppressed or repressed. Orwell's dystopia seems as if it could exist in many places in our modern world. It has been several years since I've read the book, but one hears references to Big Brother, the Thought Police, and Newspeak frequently in the media and casual conversation. Probably many people using these terms don't realize where the terms came from. I strongly recommend that you read the book.",1984
110,absolutelylucid,"Brilliantly shot and acted, but fails to portray the books most important concepts.",7,5 June 2008,"3.5/5 - Beautifully crafted sets and spectacular acting are marred by an inability to grasp some of the most important concepts in the novel. Particularly the Novels final, perhaps most crucial chapter.***Be forewarned I will deal with spoilers of the novel from here-out to illustrate my point.***I will begin with the single most important concept this film does not deal with, and that is the novels final and most important Chapter. Nineteen Eighty-Four the film almost completely ignores this final chapter. The Bookdoes far more to explain the aftermath of winstons treatment, and this is crucial to our understanding. Granted, the Books end can be perceived very different between individuals. I personally found it redeeming and hopeful of the future. The party meant to stamp the emotion, cognitive ability, and love right out of winston. Instead, they taught him how to really love, think about the world around him, and feel good natured emotion. To become a better man. The Ministry of Love had created in all their efforts exactly what they were trying to destroy. The party was fallible. It might fall, but Winston felt great gratitude towards Big Brother for teaching him these things. Winston loved Big Brother for it. Not in the way the party intended, but would he rise up against them? I do not know. The film did little to express the ideas of this chapter, and I would have had no way of formulating this idea of the novels conclusion based on it. I do not believe any viewer could come to an accurate conclusion of their personal theories of the novels final chapter based on the film. Some changes may always be necessary, even if just for keeping the running length below 3 hours, but this final chapter IMO needed to be shot word for word, scene for scene, in order, with every action meticulously displayed. The film even leaves out the crucial 'I betrayed you' comments by Winston and Julia to each other.Many other small situational contexts were changed throughout, such as the timing of events, and characters involved. George Orwell set out events in the Book in a particular order for a reason. The changing of the timing of these events blurs the ideas a little, but not to the point of serious detriment. The film does however, botch up dealing with the Brotherhood. Little mention is ever made in the film about the Brotherhood. It was my interpretation that the Brotherhood was organized and controlled by the party. An ultimate form of control. Consider the line in the book referring that the party makes the revolution to establish the dictatorship. None of this was touched upon in the film. Winston does not bring Julia to see O' Brian, and the conversation between the three does not take place in the context of the Book. In fact, a viewer who has not read the Book may not even grasp that O' Brian is claiming to be part of the Brotherhood at all.There are numerous other little changes I will not touch on. These two are the most important, and most detrimental to a film that is among the greatest ever made in the fields of acting and cinematography/directing. The scenes involving a crowd watching the telescreen are classics of cinema.So my verdict? Do not see this movie if you have not read the book. You will not get an accurate representation of the most important concepts with which to formulate an understanding of the material. Even Winstons time in the Ministry of Love is portrayed on a level minimal to the length of coverage given in the book. Read the book, then see the movie for it's artistic merits and to understand from what direction it was made, filling in the various holes from your previous reading. As a film not based on prior material, it would be one of the greatest films ever made, but it is based on a book, with ideas that crucially must be represented here. Some of the most important, are not.",1984
111,Island-Girl5,A disappointing adaptation,5,2 August 2020,"Watching a movie that's based upon a book is always hit or miss for me. I already have an idea in my head how the characters/scenes look, so the movie version might be completely different from what I had imagined. In that respect, ""1984"" actually does a pretty good job. The bleakness and grittiness of life in Oceania is depicted really well. My complaint is that so much from the book is left out of the movie. I understand that it's not possible to fit a nearly 300-page story into an under 2-hours film, but there were key pieces missing. Had I not read the novel, a lot of the dialogue and ""newspeak"" wouldn't have made any sense. They needed to include at least a little more explanation for the uninitiated viewer.",1984

Yet I couldn't help but thinking that the film needed one to understand the book to actually appreciate it.I looked at the initial act, but failed to realize the importance of it until it was explained to me afterwards. It was almost as history had been re-written while leaving important bits of information out.What *is* here is brilliant though. Wonderfully acted, with just enough dialogue for those paying attention to piece together the story and what it has to say. For someone who hasn't read the book, it's enough to make you want to delve further into the story and actually read it. For those who have already read the book, here is it's setting - wonderfully brought to life in both audio and visual.Something too has to be said of the music. The Oceania anthem is so beautifully uplifting that you'd forget that it's the anthem for a brutal dystopia. Even Eurythmics put their mark on the background music - producing one of their most underappreciated albums (you can't even find it on iTunes). It's very much a ""dark synthwave"" masterpiece on par with John Carpenter's horror music, and completely ahead of it's time.",1984
113,davidgoesboating,amazing adaptation of a classic book,10,27 October 2005,"In my opinion, 1984 by George Orwell is still the best novel I've ever read. So when I borrowed this film on video (it still hasn't been released on DVD in Australia shamefully), I didn't know what to expect, as I thought it was going to be almost impossible to put Orwell's masterpiece on screen without messing anything up. However, this is a exactly what the director achieved: he made a film which is not only a perfect film version of the book, but also a classic in its own right. John Hurt is perfect as Winston, while Suzanna Hamilton and Richard Burton (in his last ever film) are great too. It is hard to find fault with the film, so it seems strange that it only has an average rating of 6.9 on this website (and generally only gets 3/5 in film books; Fahrenheit 9/11 gets 4/5... what is this world coming too?). This is probably because of the darkness of the film, and some of the more agonizing torture scenes towards the end of the film. However, I thought the rawness of the film, the slightly faded look, and the amazing music score all contributed excellently to the film. Admittedly it is not exactly light watching, and some viewers might find it a bit oppressive, but in my opinion this was all in keeping with the classic book that it was based on.... in fact I would recommend any directors who wish to make an adaptation of a famous novel, to look at this film and see how its done.",1984
114,revcosmo,one of the best adaptations of a novel ever,9,21 November 2003,"...right up there with Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange and Cronenberg's Naked Lunch. In my estimation, a novel-made-film oughtn't be judged by its adherence to details, but rather its communication of the original spirit of the book. The film Nineteen Eighty Four flawlessly communicates the despair and hopelessness of the novel. All of the darker sides of human nature are perfectly, and thoroughly disturbingly, captured in this film. John Hurt does a marvelous job of portraying Winston Smith, the ordinary man stuck in a relentlessly dystopic society. Just when Smith is finally able to see some hope of salvation and liberation, in his forbidden love affair with Julia, that hope is smashed to bits by the cruel reality of a world bent on control and dominance.The dreariness of the set and cinematography further solidifies the paranoia of what might happen (and appears to be happening) to the world if we're not very careful of who we let in charge of it. Granted, the film is a horrible downer, to say the least. But that's the point. There are few films that chill me to the bone as 1984 does.",1984

It always seemed to me that Orwell referred as much to the United States as he did to the Soviet Union. As a radio journalist for the notorious BBC he knew the inside workings of the propaganda machinery better than most and I believe that Winston Smith has come from that experience. Of course, it could have been the Public Radio or the CNN. In any case, this is a chilling film showing the sad reality of the world we live in presently.

For some reason known only to their own Eastasian (Eurasian?) selves, they went back and tweaked the original masterpiece so that it looked like it was filmed in warm, happy Technicolor.Shades of Minitrue. Or, as Colbert would call it, ""Truthiness"".I consider myself lucky to have seen ""1984"" as it was originally presented (on cable, I wasn't old enough to see an R-rated flick in 1984), with the original look that the filmmakers intended. It was SUPPOSED to look awful!! London was SUPPOSED to look like it was falling apart! That's what happens in a Dystopia!When Spielberg went for the de-saturated look in ""Saving Private Ryan"", he won an Oscar.

Winston, the main character played by John Hurt, has an unfortunate plight. His character is actually about a leftover time, and it is an attempt to change the tyranny of Big Brother who is demonstrated well in the movie as 'always watching you'. So many of the new dictionary ""Newspeak"" terms used in this rigid society which shape everyone's thinking, and which the fanatical O'Brien believes in, are inhibiting instead of liberating. Winston dares to hope for something better which seems never to have existed. The props and scenery put into this movie and the loneliness portrayed is nicely created in the film. It is seriously, but entertainingly so, depressing to viewers given what every citizen in this society faces as cold, stark reality concocted from lies. The author George Orwell is like a 20th century ""Jonathan Swift"" who wrote allegorical novels and this movie from Orwell's book also communicates through symbolic meaning a warning as to what might could possibly happen to our own world if it is left unguarded and unchecked!",1984

This is not only an exceptionally well acted film, a film that is shot not badly, and a film that has some iconographic moments, it is a brave film philosophically. It does not pander to any particular agenda aside from a slight humanism that is forgivable given the subject matter.  It is somewhat populist, somewhat sexy and more frightening that most of the garbage being passed as horror these days.  The sexual overtones are actually quite effective in the war-torn context, and add depth to the film that might not have been there if it was purely a polemic against Trotskyism.Good stuff, and I congratulate the makers of this film for visual expansion and interpretation of an interesting, but dated, book.",1984

Nineteen Eighty-Four happens to be one of those rare cases.  The book was great.  It was immersive and interestingly prophetic.  But the movie just plain sucked. It is easily the worst film I have ever seen.  The only reason I didn't turn it off after the first 5 minutes was the fact that watching the movie was half of a two-part assignment for a class.  It was dark and grotesque, but did nothing in the way of achieving the proper atmosphere.  The acting was nothing above average, and considering the fact that there wasn't much to act out, this was severely disappointing.  The book, for example, didn't give me the impression that Winston was unable to blurt out more than a single syllable at a time. Boring, disturbing, and visually unappealing, the movie totally cannibalized the book. Wait a second...Isn't it British?",1984

Most of the other reviewers have stated just about everything about this wonderfully gritty, dark, foreboding movie that still remains an eerie parallel to our lives today, especially in the last 2 years...But I'm confused by the number of people who have commented that claim to be put off by ""the gratuitous nudity"" by the two characters of Winston and Julia. Given the fact that everything in this society--waking up, food, habits, desires, work, workers, even the underwear and overalls--is so uniform, has it occurred to viewers that being nude was the only link to identity that these characters had? Everything in their world depends, thrives on sameness. Without clothes, everyone is unique. The two lovers were already in dire conditions by committing the sin of feeling for another human being, let alone carnally but in the heart. And they had to deceive and pretend and go through the motions of the dutiful cogs in the Big Brother wheel. But their only shared peace and comfort was their sacred time alone, and in love. They had finally found their own identities through loving each other. Their nudity was merely symbolic of that. In that sense, their union and expressions of that union only becomes more fragile, beautiful and honest, in such a heartless, cold, indifferent world.May that be truly said of us, and all of us...OK, that out of the way...one of the most gritty, realistic, honest translations ever to grace the screen.

124,iansyard,Has Lost None Of It's Power To Scare You,10,1 August 2021,"I've always been aware of this classic British film from the mid 1980s as a young teen and knowing the classic novel by Orwell of the same name from grade school. But compared to the flashy snap bang and crackle films around at the same time like Gremlins, The Goonies and Ghostbusters - they had my full attention while 1984 slipped under and away from my thoughts. Well fast forward nearly 40 years later and I'm in my 40s, with the state of the world in the fast decline it's in, this film popped back up into my consciousness. With a more mature mindset for slower thinking films and now the time to sit down for 2 hours and invested myself into it, I did just that today. It's a masterpiece of filmmaking, brilliantly directed by Radford and equalled by fantastic performances by John Hurt daring to think for himself as the radical Winston Smith, and Richard Burton in his final screen performance as Inner Party member O'Brien seeking to crush Smith's spirit for free thinking. The things we know of today in pop culture ""thought police"", ""Big Brother"", ""Room 101"", ""thoughtcrime"" etc is all here nearly 40 years ago and over 70 years ago with the famous old novel. The scare factor here does not need 8ft tall Aliens or zombies, it's usually quite simple that man itself is the scariest of all, and the willingness to subject your fellow man through sadistic measures to control one's thoughts and ideals is nothing new, but all the same terrifying because the state will always win in the end. That's the message overall I took away from this great film, and you can just see it in today's Governments on a smaller scale. But George has warned us all it's coming...",1984
125,bigplatts,1984,8,19 April 2017,"George Orwell's novel '1984' was inspired by the totalitarian state of Soviet Russia, and likely the world imagined of had the Nazis won WW2. It's a grim vision, describing the day to day life of Winston Smith, an inhabitant of a grimy government-controlled and monitored world. Orwell's worst fears of dystopia. It's an enjoyable book, but surely remembered so fondly as a classic because of the message it upholds. Or more precisely: the worst case scenario it presents. Which, as many have said, isn't entirely different from the world we live in. It's a book of ideas and exaggerations. This film adaptation is great. It makes the case that all film adaptations should work together with their novel counterpart. That the question of which is better is unneeded, and is asked so often because of the laziness of film adaptations that attempt to match the source material word-for-word. Instead a film and novel, no matter which came first, should fit together like a jigsaw piece, creating a circle around the original story. This isn't a film of grand ideas; the dystopian world is the back drop here. It's a visceral movie, that acts out Orwell's grim fantasies. It's a movie about torture and about the ability of a government to control and destroy the human body, and thus the human mind. It shows the body-stretching, flesh rotting horror of such a future. Of such a regime. It's worth a watch whether you've read the book or not, because both stress different parts of the same vision.",1984
126,sean3240,A bad adaptation that looks pretty nice,5,15 November 2021,"Admittedly, going straight into this after reading the book was probably not the best idea because the story is so fresh in my mind already. That could be a reason I found most of this to be pretty damn boring, but I also think the lack of care put into this might make others feel the same. I especially think it'll be a slog for you if you haven't read the book, as the film doesn't do much for you in establishing reasons for you to care about any of it really.There's such a lack of craft here, particularly in the writing and directing of it. When you adapt a book you can't just scene for scene copy everything over, you need to put stronger emphasis on things and tell your story more visually because of all everything you lose out on from the lack of narration. There's a whole lot that won't stand out as important or entertaining when it should, as you aren't getting the pages and pages of writing that gives events/objects/people significance in the book.The only real purpose I can think of for this film is really for someone that read the book years ago and wants to be taken through the story again without needing to read the whole thing. I don't even think that's an awful thing, but I also don't think something that does that is worthy of any level of praise.I'd say it's probably most comparable to Gary Sinise's 'Of Mice and Men' film, which I did watch recently after having read the book years ago and I really enjoyed it.There were a couple aspects of this film though that I think were pretty good.One is Roger Deakin's cinematography which never fails to disappoint. The look of this film is arguably the most important thing it has in terms of bringing something new to the table. While every other aspect of the film feel like it's doing the bare minimum to fumble it's way into bringing the book to life, the visuals and colours and blocking of scenes create a tone which admirably remains consistent throughout and just looks really damn nice. If the film did anything, it created the incredible potential for a 1984 picture book!The other thing that I thought was very good in this was the casting of John Hurt. I had no idea he was in this prior to watching and when I found out he was playing Winston I was absolutely delighted. Something about the weird yet formal way he plays a lot of his characters manages to fit perfectly into how I imagined the character of Winston to be when reading the book. There really wasn't anyone I could think of when reading the book who I thought could play that character well, but as soon as I saw it was him in this movie I knew he'd be perfect. And of course he was as he always is.",1984
127,s-neaverson,A movie bogged down with it's own premise,3,21 April 2012,"It's sad to see to see such a wonderful book strangled in it's upteenth film adaptation. This film focuses far too much on Orwell's ideas and completely forgets to give any attention to it's characters.The film follows Winston Smith(John Hurt), a man disenfranchised from the dictatorial, ""big brother"" state, which is trying to clamp down on free thinking and ""orgasms,"" amongst other things. Things soon get complicated for him when he befriends a beautiful young like minded girl.Throughout this film I was in awe of the wonderful cinematography by Roger Deakins, which brings out every wrinkle of John Hurt's anguished face. The film is drained of all colour and light, reflecting the state's unfathmobable control over everything, including the colours.The main problem with this film is the lack of weight it gives to its characters. You can have all the scariest, inventive ideas in the world, but as soon as you forget your protagonist the film becomes more a lecture than a book. Winston Smith and his female accomplice are characters that you simply don't care for. They are just shells. It all seems pointless. Maybe that's the point, but you can't have an engaging story without likable, or at least relatable characters.""Brazil"" is a similar film, yet it at least brings out satire and humour in it's situation.

129,The Mogul,Disappointment's No Thought Crime: A Meritorious But Failed Adaptation *minor spoilers: only for those who haven't read the book*,6,1 February 2006,"A worthy but not entirely successful adaptation of the novel: flat and cold. Orwell's narrative is first and foremost an internal one, what is more, his characters must be careful not to betray their thoughts and feelings to others; this makes their effective translation to the screen rather difficult. The film-makers needed to be cleverer to succeed at this.The film's crumbling, bomb-scarred mise-en-scene and washed-out palette create an atmosphere of dismal oppression but never really invoke feelings of fear. The fear that Winston Smith's thoughts might be discovered is what lends tension to the book: tension which is lacking in this film. John Hurt's beaten, cipher-like characterisation might ring true, but it hardly makes for engaging viewing (at least until he enters the torture chamber).Where is the sense of constant surveillance, of Big Brother's gaze? Where is the sense of liberation when Winston escapes this? 1984's world should, but does not, feel like a panopticon.The film also fails to make the love scenes between Winston and Julia (Suzanna Hamilton) suitably exciting and transportive. The tone of these scenes is hardly an improvement on the drudgery that precedes them. Indeed the rolling green hillside on which Winston first sees Julia undress, later becomes a motif for his torture-induced mental plane; this concordance is, I think, misconceived.Winston's little junk shop is another disappointment: it has none of the nostalgic charm, none of feeling of a special place that is evoked by the book.I believe in judging a film for what it is; I am not interested in authenticity to whatever source material a film might draw from. I only make these comparisons because they are illustrative of the film's major failing: the film is, as I've said, too flat; it is Orwell's novel drained of its gnawing tension and sensual releases.Winston's 'curing' constitutes a good third of the film: a much larger proportion than it does in the book; Radford seems to have subordinated the novel's more natural tempo to the three acts mantra of the screenwriter's manual. The curing scenes just don't have the atmosphere to sustain them at their allotted length. The torturer's apparatus, including some hideously large rats, is complete, but the shooting of these scenes is so bland. Richard Burton's performance is passionless without sufficient compensating menace. Those who feel his chill feel only the chill of the circumstances: his final film performance is sadly didactic and underwhelming.The film's final let down is the moment of Winston's breaking, which, after a slow build up, is skipped over far too glibly. The climax is, in a word, anticlimactic. An extreme close up, more fervour and volume in the delivery of John Hurt's lines, sound or visual effects: something different needed to be done to add potency to this moment.The film finishes with an invented, rather dull epilogue. Something was needed, in this film at least, to demonstrate Winston's brainwashing, but this could have been more succinctly achieved. Orwell's parting words  'I had learned to love Big Brother.'  achieve this aim admirably in the novel, but they are missing from the film. If ever there was a need for a voice overHaving taken this film to pieces, I need to make it clear that it's still worth a look. It communicates the politics of its dystopia remarkably well; until Winston's interrogation, one never gets caught in a scene that feels like an explanation. Radford's adaptation is really solid in this respect.The crowd scenes effectively summon the spectre of Nazism. And the supporting cast does a good job of making us believe in their world. Gregor Fisher is convincingly credulous as Parsons.As I've said, John Hurt's torture-chamber performance is a virtue, and the urban mis-en-scene, exterior and interior, is evocative: just don't watch this one when you're feeling impatient. If you've read the book this is far from essential viewing: unfortunately, disappointed thoughts don't feel like a crime.",1984
130,jt19992012,Where was Ridley when we really needed him???!!!!,2,17 May 2014,"I'm giving this a 2 because it was shot by the great Roger Deakins. And even when working with a crappy script like this one, Deakins can't help but elevate the project with his genius lighting and camera-work.And of course, John Hurt is one of our great actors. So nothing against him. And Richard Burton a legend, as we all know.The problem with this film is the script and director.Apparently, Michael Radford, an otherwise intelligent filmmaker, figured EVERYONE knows the book SO well, that NOTHING really needs to be explained. The audience will just naturally connect all the dots and fill in all the plot holes and figure out this complex story on their own.Big mistake.This is a confusing, tediously slow-moving and nearly incomprehensible film. All the great craftsmanship that went into it was wasted.And I don't think Orwell wanted his readers to slit their wrists after reading the book, he wanted them to think. With this insanely bleak and depressing version, you might as well buy a gun before watching. That is, if you don't fall asleep first -- which is extremely likely.Radford's version can't hold a candle to the 1956 version. But without question, the greatest ""1984"" of all time is Ridley Scott's Apple Computer commercial. In my view, he's the only one so far who has perfectly captured the look, sound, and spirit of the novel. If only he'd been hired instead of Radford. Wow! Then maybe we'd have a classic film instead of this disastrous box office bomb that was barely even released. I saw in New York in '85, and I think there were about three people in the theater -- including me. What n terrible -- almost sinful -- wasted opportunity.",1984
131,Aidan_Mclaren,Good cinematic take on the novel.,8,24 June 2006,"As most people, the novel of which we all know is an excellent portrayal of a non-conformist man living and breathing in the pinnacle of totalitarianism.The movie is a nice adaption, however hampered as most most movies were back then and today by lack of sufficient time to grasp you fully as the book did.The movies strong points are the three main actors. There is no one better than John Hurt at playing Winston, fully getting into the emotional and emaciated character trying to find sense and a way to destroy the party that is responsible for the regime he is in. Suzanna Hamilton playing the equally strong-willed woman Julia who begins an illegal love-affair with Winston. And Richard Burton who resonates coldness as the all-knowing Inner Party member O'Brien.The cinematography is great, the music is also very good.However, the movie just cannot capture the entire strength of the novel. The movie is rushed to death and as a result, we never get really deep as we should have. The scenes that make this film are the opening sequence, Winston's narration of the diary he writes, and the torture of Winston. But these too are sadly dwarfed by the novel.Most movies can never equal the original novel because of budget and market constraints. No doubt this movie may have captured more strength from canon for the cinematic eye if these stupid barriers were broken.For lover's of the book and Orwell, it is still a worthwhile effort to watch this.",1984
132,benatarandres,I love you.,8,15 May 2016,"When George Orwell's publication of ""1984"" was distributed in 1949, it was not too long after the creation of two separate governments for Korea, as it was divided among the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of the North and the Republic of Korea in the south. South Korea is a moderate presidential republic. North Korea is the very nightmare Orwell's novel depicts. It is totalitarianism to the full definition of its own conception. The ""Eternal"" president and the general secretary are Kim LL Sung, and Kim Jong LL. Corpses in leadership essentially. The current president is Kim Jong UN, or as Bill Maher calls him, Kim Jung Pugsley. Little humor is to be derived from such a comparison, when really pity and sorrow is a more appropriate reaction to the citizens who live under the regime of North Korea, with little freedom, or rarely any individuality in their existence. The same can be said for the people of Ocenia as they praise their ever loving Big Brother, for whatever greater good the party of Insoc (English Socialism) has declared. The details never matter, for the purpose of totalitarianism in its nationalistic intentions is to promote ignorance, and to discourage all forms of independence with the ultimate goal to be that of slavery, masked as loyalty. Winston Smith (Hurt), a frail, and subtle loner, lives a pathetic and empty life in his methodical existence. His profession consists that of a worker at the ministry of truth, rewriting history, and preventing any essence of truth from reaching the surface of an ongoing war. He attends daily meetings of erratic praise, as many of the blue collared workers of the both the inner and outer parties praise the image of Big Brother, their all powerful and omniscient ruler. There is not a street corner where Big Brother's face isn't shown, or a room with a television screen of his bulgy focused eyes locked dead onto you. Children are recruited into groups known as the thought police, breeding suspicion among those they supposed to be thought criminals, as in those who commit the crimes of thinking. Friends, family, neither matters, anyone guilty of thought crime is considered an enemy of Big Brother and subjected to re-education therapy. Winston's world is forever changed when he receives a letter from a women named Julia (Hamilton), saying ""I love you."" Perplexing at first, and odd to the degree of such a confession, but with the curiosity of his wondering spirit, Winston pursues Julia to the point where they begin a forbidden affair, experiencing the sexual pleasure and the emotional love their society tirelessly works to prevent. As their love affair becomes more intimate, there comes an even greater understanding to Winston and his past, feeling regret for the sins of his childhood, and the doubts he holds to this day in being a human being, and remaining one against an evil as threatening as totalitarianism One of the central themes of 1984, aside from its direct opposition to nationalistic totalitarianism, is that it is an examination that tackles both the beautiful and the equally horrible parts of the human soul. Through the character Winston, there comes an unraveling of the certain extents that human nature represents. There are two sides to the fragile and well-meaning Winston. Through his love affair with Julia, comes the gentle and benevolent side that is still discovering the concepts of beauty and happiness, forsaking the absurd notion of purity and embracing the tranquility of an old woman singing as though these were peaceful times. Then comes the cowardly and terrified side to his persona. It is a side that only those that haven't read the novel will find surprising in the dark revelations regarding the human condition. It is mostly shown through the chilling performance Richard Burton gives as O'Brian. As a member of the inner party, O'Brian lives a more comfortable lifestyle, being mysterious and cunning in his remarks. He gives Winston dreams of hope, while raising suspicions in the audience. It is a brilliant performance that manifests a cold representation of the human being's utter indifference towards suffering, mostly generated and beaten by a similar means of past suffering. Anyone who picks up a copy ""1984"" can merely see written words and images. As a filmmaker, Michael Radford captures the nightmare that George Orwell envisioned, generating a philosophical discussion regarding politics, the manipulation of history, and humanity in is most sensitive areas of understanding. For those who've already read the novel, fully know what happens in the conclusion. Given the film's faithful portrayal of the novel, 1984 distances itself from a typically broad ending and sticks to the tragic ending that symbolizes the corruptibility of human beings. Winston is lured into the mysterious room 101. It only takes moments for him but to beg and scream for his torturers to torment and subject Julia to the same sort of suffering. Then and only then does the film truly conceive of the central point, as it causes us to reflect on the part within ourselves that is most vulnerable. Human beings are intriguing creatures indeed, especially in the conception of their capabilities. It is mysterious at times what we are capable of in our willingness, and the film presents that in an atrocious and pitiful form of betrayal as Winston relinquishes the one he loves most, thus fully capitalizing on the deepest and most deteriorated part of the human soul, the part that is willing to do anything to end suffering, even if it means forsaking the very qualities that grant them the privilege to love or acquire their humanity. Then and only then does Big Brother truly win. O'Brian said it himself, ""You must love him. It's not enough to obey him. You must love him"".",1984

Society is controlled by a single party and the world is in a constant state of staged war between three super powers. Video surveillance is constant through Vid screens in virtually every room, and constant risk of being denounced as a thought criminal. Against this background our hero is a minor functionary amending past historical events so as to fit in with current party propaganda making war heroes un people. Anyone who asks what happened to the £60 Billion stolen by Thatcher from pension companies and the £60 Billion short fall in pension provision might already understand the basic mechanics of how this happens. Wilson meets a young anti sex league worker and they begin a torrid affair. This is a must see for anyone who likes to think for themselves and is genuinely concerned for the future a truly accurate adaptation of the Orwell novel.

However this is only for those who have read the book. The plot is kind of vague at times and only if you have read the book you can understand. Further more the movie manages to become a glorified hymn against communism, whereas Orwell in this book is against totalitarianism, and yes he criticizes Stalin, but more on what the USSR was heading rather than communism in general.In any cases avoid this.

139,zacharyhamstra,Pales in comparison to novel,6,4 July 2020,"1984 the novel is probably, in my opinion, the best book I have ever read. I really enjoy George Orwell and Animal Farm is stellar but 1984 is just phenomenal. As for the movie, I just felt like it was so underwhelming. Now, to be fair. This was filmed in 1984. I'm 22. I'm used to better graphics and CGI, etc. and this was obviously lacking in that area. So, perhaps a newer version would provide better aesthetics and simply match what I imagined the book's setting and machinery to be. Secondly, the movie was simply too short to ever be anywhere near as powerful as the book. Winston is underdeveloped, his relationships are underdeveloped, everything moves too quickly. Additionally, I think for someone who maybe hasn't read the book, they miss a lot of subtleties that the movie merely references but doesn't explicitly say or attract attention to. This movie really needs more like 3 hours in my opinion. They did do a good job at sticking to the plot and trying to stay on course, but the inevitable croppings were just too detrimental. If you're part of the older crowd maybe this can do it for you because of the movie quality, otherwise, I think stick to the book. This left a rather underwhelming taste in my mouth despite its positives. It simply pales in comparison.",1984
140,IllogicalGenius,A condensed version of the book,5,21 February 2019,"I'd just finished reading the book a day or two before. So it was all still fairly fresh in my mind.While I loved seeing the characters and the setting come to life. I couldn't ignore the anachronisms or skipping over parts of the plot.As a stand-alone film, this would not work. As another review read, without having read the book prior, another viewer might be horribly confused or bored before the end.The overall look of Oceania seemed accurate to me. The ruins of the buildings. Having to step over uneven soil and rubble set the sense of the lack of luxury they go without.In the book there's a lot of focus on individuals not even so much as being permitted to let emotion or innermost thoughts cross their faces. While it is apparent in most of the acting I think more could be done to make this more obvious to further illustrate the betrayal to the state Winston and Julia were partaking. From the 180 of being stone faced to the torture he endured and finally having that meticulous facade being torn away.I recognised a lot of things I wish were done more successfully that if in another life, I had been the director of the film, what I'd have done to portray the sense of control big brother had over party members.While I enjoyed the film, it did feel rushed a little. It's a shame that it seems that budget was an issue. As with a little more money they could've taken it further.And when Julia and Winston defected to the brotherhood it wasn't made clear and that particular crime is what finally lead to their capture.There were some deviations in the dialogue. While some were almost exact to the book. Others I thought was an odd choice to change.Good to see Orwell's characters come to life, but its not as faithful to the original content as some say. Worth a watch if you enjoyed the book.",1984
141,jawills,"""We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness...""",10,23 May 2000,"Michael Radford's utterly superlative film of Orwell's famed novel may well be the greatest cinematic adaptation of a major literary source ever -- and it stands out as one of the most memorable British films of the past thirty years.  Full credit is due to cinematographer Roger Deakins who shoots everything in grainy, washed-out, desaturated colors adding to the picture's atmosphere of wistful yet austere, dream-like strangeness.  The modern London settings -- with their cobblestone streets, shabby, dilapidated buildings, desolate fields, rubble-strewn alleyways, and forbidding, blackened Gothic-Victorian façades and hints of minimalist fascist architecture -- resemble a Depression-era housing project after the Luftwaffe.  And Dominic Muldowney's score, with its martial clarion calls, bombastic church-organ blasts, and swelling choral leitmotiv of `Oceania, 'tis for thee,' has a mixture of Wagnerian grandeur and Bach-like religiosity about it.  All the while, the bizarre, mantra-like drones of the much-maligned Eurythmics soundtrack rises and falls, weaving in and out of the narrative like so many subconscious banshee wails.
Radford treats the book's premise not as a sci-fi flight of fantasy or grim prophecy but rather as the world of 1948 seen through a glass darkly -- a kind of medieval morality play for the post-totalitarian age.  There is less emphasis on the novel's musty, well-worn-and-endlessly-picked-over polemical import and more focus on the stark human element, and indeed, the actors bear such uncanny resemblance to Orwell's descriptions they practically seem born for their roles.With his quiet, brooding eloquence and haunted eyes peeking out of a gaunt, cadaverous frame like a tubercular, ashen-faced Egon Schiele figure, John Hurt is ideally cast as Winston Smith.  As Julia, Suzanna Hamilton (first seen as a lovelorn dairymaid in Polanski's TESS and as the paralyzed daughter in BRIMSTONE AND TREACLE) has a serene, arresting presence  and she appears as mysteriously stirring and beguiling to us as she does to Hurt.  She brings a captivating freshness and warmth to her role, a little reminiscent of a young Harriet Andersson.  Her pale, wiry, broad-hipped body has a simple, unaffected, almost archetypal beauty, and in the film's more intimate moments, she radiates all the tactile sensual grace of a Munch or Degas nude.As O'Brien, the Jesuitical inquisitor of infinite patience, Richard Burton delivers a superbly perspicacious swan-song performance  he becomes almost a kind of an oracular Thanatos to Hamilton's Eros.  In an exquisite, maliciously Swiftian twist of irony, Burton's famous voice, with its rich, mellifluous Welsh inflections and descending cadences of Shakespearean sonnets and Dylan Thomas poetry, becomes a cruel herald of the willful, systematic destruction of the human spirit -- of `the worst thing in the world' that waits in Room 101 in the fated `place where there is no darkness.'  When O'Brien tells Winston, `you are thinking that my face is old and tiredand that while I talk of power I am unable to prevent the decay of my own body,' Burton's sagging, weary face speaks volumes.In the lesser roles, Gregor Fisher's Parsons literally resembles a sweaty frog, James Walker's Syme is the classic image of a squirrelly, mealy-mouthed hack-intellectual, while Andrew Wilde cuts the most chilling figure as the bespectacled, unblinking company man,' Tillotson.  The late Cyril Cusack plays Mr. Charrington, the kindly Cockney landlord who is not all that he appears to be, with an understated sentimental charm punctuated by slight flickers of calculating menace (watch closely for the way Cusack's facial expression changes whenever Hurt is not looking at him).  Phyllis Logan (the star of Radford's début feature, ANOTHER TIME, ANOTHER PLACE, and a supporting player in Mike Leigh's SECRETS AND LIES) provides one of the film's most clever unacknowledged ironies: as the Telescreen Announcer, her strident, hectoring voice suggests a more shrill caricature of Margaret Thatcher.If anything, this film makes a unique and compelling case for some of the oldest cinematic devices in the book that nearly all contemporary filmmakers have since abandoned: slow dissolves, fades, blackouts, shock-cuts, slow motion, flashbacks, montage.  The high-contrast photography, alternately harsh and low-key lighting, and iconic close-up shots evoke the abstract, transcendental purity of Bresson or Dreyer.  There is even one extraordinary sequence when Winston, bruised and battered, is seen having his head shorn in a holding cell that is clearly meant to recall Falconetti's famous haircutting scene in Dreyer's LA PASSION DE JEANNE D'ARC (1928). Similarly, Burton is filmed in oppressive, looming low-angle with Expressionist shadows defining the lines of his craggy visage à la Eugène Silvain's Bishop Cauchon sans the warts.  And the idyllic barley fields of the Golden Country,' where Winston and Julia have their first tryst is a possible homage to the titular peasant paradise of Dovzhenko's EARTH (1926).What makes the film so powerful is not merely its fidelity to its source but its vivid sense of realism.  NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR is such an impassioned and richly textured work that the visuals almost seem to seep into the pores of your skin, intoxicating you with dread and longing.  And Radford is so adept at obscuring the boundaries that separate the ameliorative persistence of reverie from the glaring harshness of waking reality, that the film's seamless perfection becomes almost frightening.",1984

143,Typonaut2000,Not to be forgotten,10,14 January 2001,"There were two ghosts that hung over the second half of the twentieth century: The novel 1984 and the wreck of the Titanic. It was the ghost of the future, and the ghost of the past.Up until the year 1984 there was the constant fear that George Orwell's prophesy would prove correct - which, I suppose, was what Orwell had intended. There were times when the pendulum seemed to swing toward, and then away and then toward totalitarianism, even in the United States. By the time the year finally arrived, most people were no longer terrified of this phantom. And now you no longer have glib commentators invoking the image of a totalitarian future with the phrase ""1984.""Growing up in the last third of the 20th century, the Titanic was like a mirror-image ghost of 1984, the past embalmed beneath the sea, preserving a world of grand innocence that died with World War I, or at least the image of innocence and grandeur that we projected upon it. Ironically, that ghost was exhumed two years later, in 1986, but it was not until the movie that it was finally exorcised through trivialization.While I was disappointed with the movie Titanic, I was not disappointed with the movie Nineteen Eighty-Four. I do not know of a better rendition of a novel. I am amazed at how accurately the mood, imagery and even scenery of the movie matched the ones created in my mind by reading Orwell's novel several times since early adolescence. After all, these were my images, my subconscious, my fears. And yet here they were on the screen. It is a testament to Orwell's writing that he was able to create such vivid imagery that found its way faithfully into so many minds. And it is a testament to the film's producer; proof that a book can be transformed into a movie accurately. Judging from some of the other reviews, not everyone shares this view. But as I recall from my college lit classes, not everyone was capable of understanding every book, so could some of this be the reader-viewer's fault?One detail in the movie that I found amusing was the depiction of computers. It was a melding of teletype keyboards from the 1940s with monitors using 1960s technology. I can't help thinking that that is the kind of computer technology we would have if government and the courts were to dictate the rules.Freedom requires individual initiative unencumbered by government, as far as possible. However, corporations grown beyond control or accountability may be an even greater threat. The end of the Soviet Union, one of inspirations for 1984, is not the end of Big Brother. And, oddly, modern computer technology is only now creating the capability of producing true omnipresent paranoia. How many of us wonder, as we are sitting at out computers at work or at home, whether someone is watching our work?If you are looking for sheer entertainment, Nineteen Eighty-Four will disappoint you. So, too, if you don't like ""history."" But even though the time is now in the past, the ghost may still be in the future. And for that reason, I hope people will still read the book AND watch this impeccable cinematic rendition of Orwell's masterpiece.",1984

The awful music by the Eurythmics just emphasises the point. Sexcrime? Yes, that's mentioned in the book, but the book isn't about sex and this aspect is too prominent. It's more of a love story, if anything. And of course, it's about freedom, politics, language and the inability to say what you choose. Maybe today, these themes are more relevant and a much better movie could be made. As it is, Brazil was better at being 1984 than this, which explains why it scored higher. I would also give the film a special award for the most conspicious waste of John Hurt's talent.",1984

Anyone who states otherwise probably misses a large majority of human existence due to their limited mental capacity.John Hurt, as ever performs admirably and the attempts to convey the mass-adoption of a totalitarian regime can only be applauded but the film really fails when you realise that half of the film deals with the last few chapters of the book rather than focusing on the societal factors that both facilitate and sustain such a regime.

151,ChaGuana,Pointless,1,14 October 2001,"I saw this movie literally directly after finishing the book, and maybe that was a neutral idea or a very stupid one. I think it was the latter. First of all, it was inaccurate in many small, yet important details. One of the first things I noticed was, during Winston's day to day life in his work, his conversations, eating in the cafeteria, etc. he feels free to look unhappy and make suggestive glances at people without immense fear. One of the most important parts of the book, was that even in small activities it was virtually impossible to safely show even a hint of his true emotions on his face AT ANY MOMENT. This is also shown in the scenes on the streets of the proletarions. In the book Winston knew that this was a huge risk to wander around there and was skeptical and frightened at every trip. While in the movie, he does it so often and without fear, that you lose the important feeling of heavy surveillance and risk right off the bat.Other minor inaccuracies included Winston hiding his diary in the wall, yes a very small change, but it begs the question, what's the point? There was also the most annoying thing a director can do with a book, and that is morphing characters. The large inaccuracies were far more disturbing, however. First of all, one of the important pieces of the book is that Big Brother is a government based on an intelligent, yet crude philosophy. In the movie, they skip that and go straight to making you think that the government is run by Hitler with technology. Which is true, in a sense, when directed with its facism, but if that's all you get out of Big Brother, you really missed the point of the book. The terrifying thing about Big Brother is that, in a way, it has some points behind its philosophy. When O'Brien is picking at Winstons mind in the Ministry of Love, he is LISTENING to everything Winston says against Big Brother. The fact that he listens, and advances forward in his philosophy, is in effect what is most creepy and intriguing. In the end, (careful SPOILER ahead) when Winston says he loves Big Brother, the terrifying thing is that you are not sure whether it was souly the beating and torture that caused this, or the actual power behind the philosophy. I am in no way saying that the Big Brother's philosophy has points that appeal to me, but its intelligence and depth is what makes this book incredibly disturbing. Also, how could anyone feel any connection between Julia and Winston in the film? It was awful, no connection whatsoever. And where was O'Brien before he gave Winston his address? One of the things that carried the book was Winstons thoughts about O'Brien BEFORE he made contact with him. In the movie, they just jump the gun. But that about sums up why this movie was a terrible adaption: because its impossible NOT to jump the gun and morph characters in less than two hours. How could anyone think this movie was watchable if it was under two hours? At the very least, the movie demands 3 hours to be able to capture some of the important moods and connections. Anything less is just pointless.If you loved the book, and I mean TRULY adored it, you will not approve of this movie, and chances are, you already knew you wouldn't. Because the book is unfilmable, and this movie just proves how impossible it is cram something decent into a small reel of film.Two stars out of ten",1984
152,sreeduttasamanta,1984,10,21 August 2016,"""Freedom is the freedom to say two plus two equals four."" Writes Winston in his diary sitting on a stool in a corner where the telescreen cannot direct what he is doing. Winston lives in a world dominated by telescreens and microphones, a world where people have two hands, two legs and the body of a human, but the mind of a sheep, repeating what has been told by the party and their leader Big Brother, a face with two eyes, but with no identity of the person. In such a world where privacy is a scarce commodity, Winston is the last man with an original brain, which understands the wrongdoings of the party and wants an opportunity to express itself.George Orwell's novel 1984 answer the basic question of our political system- can an individual face the might of the government? The answer is no. An individual, however hard he/she tries cannot face the might of the party and gets decimated ultimately. Such is the story of our character Winston, a citizen of a vast country called Oceania. His only problem is that he is denied the pleasure of ignorance and brainwashing unlike other people; He wants to challenge the power of Big Brother despite knowing that the consequences would be fatal- vaporized from the face of the earth. Winston, urged by his overflowing desire of rebellion, has an affair with a woman called Julia. It was a political act against the party and Big Brother. However, like most situations where world wins and individuals loses, Winston and Julia's rebellion is crushed by brutal force and they are taken into room 101, a place with no dark, but still holding the worst thing of the world. There they are subjected to pain and through pain their love and their yearning to be free is squeezed out- the things which made them a man. Winston understands that 2 plus 2 is not 4, but anything that the party wishes. Sometimes five and sometimes three. This movie by the awesome acting of John Hurt (Winston) Shows that human brain is nothing but a playing toy in the hands of powerful people as is a doll in a child's hands.",1984

One of the greatest motion pictures ever made, 1984 describes the Fascist state we live in today. A docile, repressed, uniformed populace, unending war, scapegoats targeted by the government -- it's all here and now. Of particular interest is the fact that the movie was shot during the year 1984, and in the summer when the novel took place, and in the same city -- London -- in which the novel took place. The gritty look of the film stock is appropriate, matching the mood of the times the characters lived in. I was surprised to find that Michael Radford had directed the more recent Merchant of Venice with Al Pacino, being a much different and inferior motion picture. I can only suppose that after creating such a masterpiece in 1984, there is no place left to go. 1984 was Richard Burton's last film, and his most important.",1984

Hell, total recall was released a few years later and that did a good job of it, even a clockwork orange released in the 70s did a good job of trying to make a futuristic world. The bleak German expressionistic colours, the black and white footage from the vision screens, there is no reason for this approach for when the film was made in 1984. The main character is in a white collar writing job yet he dresses like he works with oil and grease in a garage. This film decides to take a mock-communistic approach to set design, atmosphere and theme, yet the novel did not necessarily dictate a communist, worship-the-humble-worker theme itself. This book seriously needs to be adapted in a modern context as this book is more relevant today than ever before. I could not watch more than 20 minutes of this crap.

In this world, not only saying things as they are is unimaginable but even thinking them through is a crime as the citizenry needs to be dumbed down into a servile and mindless horde. Knowledge is power and it must be destroyed so that the perceived reality can be more easily shaped by oppressors who will settle for nothing less than blind devotion from people to perpetuate their own rule.

159,cosmicdrip,verbatim but flat,10,20 September 2004,"Visually director Michael Radford nailed the landscape and mood of 1984. Winston (John Hurt) and Julia (Suzanna Hamilton) were played by actors who understood and became the role and were not beautiful or attractive in any way (just as Orwell describes them). However, Richard Burton was slightly miss-cast as O'Brien, his character dedication weakened as the movie progressed. The overall story jumps from point to point, leaving no room for building suspense. The viewer is allowed to hear Winston's inner thoughts (practically the foundation for the novel) and there are just not enough scenes in the film to stress how important this is. A viewer will go through the 1st quarter of the film unaware of how Winston feels about his station in life and society as a whole.

160,dr-strangeprk,Movie = Novel.,10,15 July 2012,"I gave the movie a '10' because I read the book (some time ago), and the screenplay captured to mood, the dreariness, the hopelessness, the dialogue and the characters inch perfectly. As you read a novel, you come to picture in your mind the characters the author has created. The characters played on the screen by John Hurt, Richard Burton and Suzanna Hamilton are the 100% embodiment of what Orwell intended. The novel is not compromised in plot, dialogue, or character portrayal whatsoever.The finite movie run time of 113 min. did not allow the movie to deliver all the miserable detail of a limitless novel. E.g., the novel devoted much time into detailing ""Newspeak"", which was the devolution of the English language into a dumbed down simplified version of itself in step with the dumbing down of it's citizenry into a mindless mob. But in defense of the movie, that detail does not readily lend itself to the screen because it requires no characters or dialogue.It remains a mystery to me why Orwell (real name Eric Blair), who was a devout socialist, would portray the outcome of socialism in the honest manner that he did. Nevertheless, my bottom line critical analysis is that the movie = the novel. If that's what you're looking for in a novel based movie, you will give ""1984"" a '10' also",1984
161,skaterfreak809,Just Read the Book,5,23 April 2011,"READ THE BOOK, simple as that. This movie version of 1984 is MEDIOCRE at best and is guaranteed to leave any enthusiasts of the book sorely disappointed. The masterful scenery/imagery from the novel translates very poorly to this big screen adaptation, leaving one who has not already read Orwell's 1984, to have little to no understanding of what is actually going on. The pace of the movie, in opposition to the book, seems too fast - and causes for a number of important scenes/events to be barely skimmed over or skipped completely. Character development, scene depiction, the chronological order of events, all seems sacrificed for the sake of promoting a poor movie version of a classic novel. Initially, i thought it'd be nice to have some sort of visual aid to help with what was described in the book, however after watching the film, I felt betrayed that I must now have such a sub-par tool for reference between the two versions. The movie will offer you NOTHING not already presented in the book, and does a bad job in ever believing it can.

This adaptation manages to create some evocative imagery, sending you to the ravaged, fear-filled world of Airstrip One, which looks a lot like post-Blitz London might've. The squalor of the apartments cafeterias and even the people is all there. The rage you feel when Julia and Winston are discovered by the Thought Police is real, too. As is the sense of dread you feel every time Winston Smith writes in his diary to no one -- the act of Thoughtcrime. Particularly gripping, though, is O'Brien's interrogation of Winston in the Ministry of Love. This scene explores what is going through Winston's mind in a fresh way -- thanks to the well-built character John Hurt constructed for the film. This movie creates a sense of atmosphere of such power that viewers who haven't read the book won't miss the central points of the story.",1984
163,fuxfell,Good depiction,7,6 January 2001,"Well, first off, I want to say, that I liked Orwell's book a lot more than this film, but - as I ADORE the book - this doesn't say the movies bad.Instead, I think it is a good addition to the book as the movie gives a very good depiction of the gloomy and somewhat claustrophobic London of 1984, the city where a love story between Winston Smith, a 40-somewhat old man whose work is to change old newspapers and make their contents fit to the ""common"" knowledge of the totalitarian system he lives in, and the young girl Julia. The problem is, in this fictional 1984, everything is controlled by cameras and the only place you got to be free is your mind. But as the most interesting part of Orwell's fiction, the leaders know this and want to change the language itself by deleting uncomfortable words (p.e. revolution and so on). Of course, though the couple is REALLY careful, their love is discovered and they get imprisoned. I have to add that in 1984, love as we know it is forbidden and man and woman only team up for making children (as hard as this may sound). But now Winston is getting a delightful insight in the way his world works...As already said, this is a very good depiction of the book. It is not a bad movie or only decent, it is good, but I think, that the problem of this film is, as the majority of the book plays in Winston's mind, you cannot put it into a movie well. They did their best and I enjoyed it, regarding it as a very good movie on a book (because they kept close to the original).",1984

Without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery, and even with it I'm still no more educated about the story of 1984 than I was before I watched it.On the plus side...The cinematography is amazing, Hurt & Burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate. The prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making.Now for the down sides, and there are plenty...There is a war going on, (at least as far as the propaganda is concerned), but why & with who? Nothing is explained. There are a couple of names bandied about (Eurasia etc), but they mean nothing without explanation.Who is Winston? what does he do? where does he come from? where does he work? why is he changing news reports? why isn't he on the front line? Why doesn't he eat the food in the canteen? What is that drink he's drinking through the entire film? Why is he so weak & ill? Why isn't he brainwashed like the rest of them? What's the deal with his mother & sister? What happened to his father? A little back story would have been nice, no scrub that, essential for those like myself that haven't read the book. Without it, this is just a confusing and hard to follow art-house movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going on.The soundtrack was dis-jointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the Big Brother screens swamps the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out whats going on. I accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it's very annoying all the same.Also, I know this has been mentioned before, but why all the nudity? It just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage.I personally can't abide the way Hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days. We are not all brainwashed simpletons, but this is a few steps too far the other way. I can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that you've read the book because if this film really is the 'literal translation' that I've seen many people say, I would find it very hard to understand why 1984 is hailed as the classic it is.There's no denying that it was light years ahead of it's time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date, (maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be?), but many sci-fi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storyline.I guess I have to do what I should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if i'm to make any sense out of this.All in all, very disappointed in something I've waited for years to watch.",1984

Radford sets an acceptable pace given this story's bleak content and there are some truly memorable scenes (especially between the O'Brien and Winston characters in the second half).  However, I think this movie really fails in captivating its audience fully.  Anytime a classic novel is turned into film there is certainly risk in not being ""true"" to the original material.  I think Radford does a decent job of captivating the right visual cues from the book, I just felt the characters wandered too much during the first half and I felt very disconnected with them by the time I'm suppose to feel pity for them in the second half.""1984"" Is still worth a watch if you're a fan of political dramas, but I doubt it has ever had the impact on its viewers the way Orwell's writing impacts his readers.  Tough material for Radford to adapt to screen, and I give him a lot of credit for trying.Strangely, the DVD version of this movie seems to have adopted Orwell's social-minimalist ideology in its own presentation.  This DVD is bare, folks.  Transfer is OK, but audio is still in MONO, if you can believe that. The only extra material is the original trailer and that's it.  There isn't so much as an insert card for the keepcase!?

171,aiotici,A keen introspective into communism,10,2 February 2004,"For anyone that hasn't lived in or experienced communism, the film might appear ideologically foreign. However, the truth is that Orwell, knowingly or not (as the novel was written too early for him to ascertain the true impact of communism) captured the essence of life in a totalitarian ""socialist"" regime (one that was embraced by many eastern european countries). Having lived through it, I recognized right away many elements that comprised life in those circumstances. The brainwashing and 'thought police' are very eloquent examples of such elements. The film itself does the novel credit and provides an adaptation that is very true to the idea it tried to convey. Visually it is also quite effective, creating the stark, desperate, claustrophobic mood that helps propel set ideas. The acting, of course, is top notch as both Burton and Hurt turn in impressive performances.

175,csmchris,1984 is not a work of 'Science Fiction.',10,14 September 2004,"The 20th anniversary of this film has put it into rotation on some cable networks, so a fresh and different review seems in order. I'm having trouble understanding where some of the other reviewers on this site are coming from. Some seem to be complaining that the film didn't entertain them properly, while others slam the book on which the film was based. Incredibly, others contort their thoughts to find parallels between the fictional world of 1984 and real life 2004, particularly real life US society. This must be an important work of art, otherwise it would be ignored. So, having said that, here's my review:1984 is not a work of 'Science Fiction.' It is political/psychological fiction. We are introduced to a world some 20 years into a socialist revolution. (The book places the revolution at about 1965.) The landscape and scenery is almost shockingly bleak, but evidence of a great, productive society once existing there is visible. Somehow I was able to perceive that I was looking at a future London, England. (The book clues you in on the location. The English accents also help! It's hard to explain this perception, but anyone who's been to England surely must feel it.) After many years of war, society has been reduced to a subsistence level. Everything is in short supply, but constant news updates proclaim great improvements in the quality of life. All of Oceania lives under the constant threat of defeat in a war with its sworn enemy 'Eurasia.' Propaganda is constant and relentless. A news blurb informs the public that a victory in some battle has brought the war against 'Eurasia' close to an end. The same message is repeated at the end of the film, but the enemy has changed to 'Eastasia.' The most important theme of the book and film lies here. It doesn't matter who Oceania is at war with, or whether or not the war is even real. The population must believe the war is real, thus their suffering is necessary for victory to be realized. Thus, the elite 'Inner Party' can exert power over the populace and remain in control. The main character asked the key question when he said 'I understand the 'How' but I don't understand the 'Why.' It's all about power and control.The main character is complicit in this vast fraud in a small way, and grows disillusioned. He is compelled to have a forbidden affair with a young woman, and to join a rebellion against his world. You can feel the tension develop as he continues to have hope for the future. The viewer knows he will be caught, and eventually, he is. The final act of the film details how he is brought back into line with the party. His mind is destroyed and rebuilt, so he will believe anything the party tells him. Like Big Brother, the Soviet Union used propaganda and force to maintain control. Look at any of the current documentaries of North Korea and you hear a constant voice over loudspeakers. How much do you want to bet those announcements are of how much grain was produced, or how the standard of living has risen? Meanwhile everybody is starving. 1984 was and is a powerful and accurate portrayal of the ultimate socialist society. As we look back from 2004, the parallels with the Soviet Union, Red China and North Korea are plentiful. How some reviewers on this site see Big Brother in modern American society I'll never know. The term 'Big Brother' must be one of the most mis-used themes in literary history. Using video cameras to monitor high crime areas is not big brothernor is protecting freedom by aggressively pursuing those who seek to do it harm. What is 'Big Brother-esq' is presenting loose theories as fact, like in the film 'JFK' , or using movies to change public perception about a past war, like has been done over and over again with the Vietnam war. Remember, Big Brother is a socialist, just like Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Castro, Kim Il Jong, Pol Pot..Finally, regarding 1984 as a 'Movie.' Well, don't watch it to get revved up for a Saturday night out. It's meant to be an intellectual challenge, not a simplistic action adventure or sappy romantic drama. It does what any truly great movie does it transports the viewer into another reality, and leaves him/her wanting more answers. 1984 is masterful in its ability to provoke thought, and in providing the viewer a chance to see what such a world would be like without having to experience it first hand. I say 10 out of 10. It's not my favorite movie of all time, but surely is on the list. I'm confident this review will be roundly bashed by any further reviewers, but hopefully some will appreciate this point of view.",1984

If you have read the book, don't watch this film, you will be utterly disappointed. Going into the film I was curious as to how it would be pulled off, as the book seemed to me pretty much unfilmable. After watching, I am convinced the book is unfilmable. All of the vital philosophy and theory of Orwell's seminal work is lost in this adaptation. Orwell's deep understanding of both human nature and the operation of totalitarian states make the book a chilling read which makes a very convincing argument for why '1984' shows the natural conclusion of state power. All of this is absent from the film, as we have none of Winston's narration or Goldstein's book, and a very short version of O'Brien's monologue, which, I would say, are the most important aspects of the book. Both the narrative and character development are dreadful. Had I not read the book, I doubt I would've had any idea what was going on. The Two Minutes Hate, the Ministry of Truth, the memory hole, Newspeak, Doublethink and Thoughtcrime are explained either insufficiently or not at all, and without these concepts, the story is nothing. As for the characters, there is no explanation of Winston or Julia's thoughts toward the Party or their histories, and no real connection is established between the two. The character of O'Brien is where the creators fail the most, though. We get none of Winston's thoughts about him before his flimsy introduction, which makes his presence almost meaningless for the most part of the film. Winston's dream is shown and the line ""We will meet in the place where there is no darkness"" is said, but neither are explained. While Orwell's characters were hardly three dimensional in the first place, the film reduces them even further. The film's only redeeming features are the visuals, which convey well the bleak, homogeneous nature of this society, and the interesting soundtrack, which has a similar effect, also bringing a spooky, futuristic quality to the aesthetic.I know that an adaptation is a work of art in its own right, and should be regarded separately from the book, but with this sacrilegious desecration of Orwell's work it is impossible. It is saddening to think that some people may think of '1984' primarily as a film. It seems the makers have tried to introduce subtlety to the story that was not in the book, but it has an overwhelmingly negative effect, this is not meant to be a subtle story. This is the first review I've written, and I've done it to warn people not to bother with this film, as the incomprehensibly positive reviews on here mislead me. At the end I was angry at how much this story had been ruined. In conclusion, while the book exists, this film is a wholly pointless creation. Just stick to the book.",1984
178,learner_good,2+2=8 that is my rating for this movie.,7,19 November 2016,"I never read a book and never watched the old version. This movie isn't only about war and power, its about the human's original thought and psychological. It really touch the corner my heart for its beautiful storytelling. The movie is successful to show such complexity of human thought and psychological strength. The beginning of the movie is not much appealing and not much entertaining but it's engaging. And the climax scene has everything.2+2=? the question not much as simple as it used to be. it's feel so unusual but it's very natural for me.

I was in year 10 (and aged 15) so that may have has something to do with it. But for English this year, year 11, we had to read Animal Farm, also by George Orwell. Aside from the fact that the book is based on the Revolution, my opinion is that it is a terrible book, and I also hated it.But 1984, I think it was the most disturbing movie I have ever seen, and I think that George Orwell is one of the most deranged people ever to live on this planet. I'm sorry to everyone who loved his work, but I unfortunately did not. The themes in the movie were well portrayed, but the way the whole movie was set and the events that took place within it were not to my standards. This is only my opinion, and I'm sure many many other people thoroughly enjoyed this film.",1984

I first saw this film when I was 13-14, when I hadn't read the book yet, but just as I was starting to enjoy myself my father made sure I did follow the ""read the book first rule"" by changing channel with the words ""What's this rubbish I want to see something better...bla,bla,bla!"" and flicked on to some worn out old western, so I went to the bookcase, got the book out and read. Years later I hired the video and finally got watching the film in peace, realising how good and how close to the book it was. One of the interesting differences comparing it with the original text is the use of the words ""brother and sister"" used by party members to address each other, Orwell used comrade. I think this was done as in 1984 the term comrade still had (and has to this day, but more so in the pre '89 world) a great political meaning, being used not only by communists but also by socialist, so I interpret this as an act of political diplomacy. I've seen the film and read the book several times, as well as Orwell's other works. And if one thinks about it can be a good instrument to understand a few odds and ends of what is going on today...oops I think I'm committing thoughtcrime, the Thoughtpolice will be after me.

This 1984 version of Orwell's novel is meant to be seen after reading the paper version rather than the usual Cliff Notes premise of seeing the film instead of reading the book.With a breathtaking and often despairing authenticity the casting, acting, writing, production and set design bring even more life into the mental picture of Oceania and give subtle detail to one of the century's great works. The film works in the mind in the same way that a painting of a familiar place can add reality even in its lack of pure realism itself.I'd rate this a must see for anyone interested in film, literature or politics.

When I watched it for the first time I thought it was the old version(1956). When I really found out the true year of the film I was shocked. I didn't know that there could be such a bad film made so recently. Thats really all I wanted to say. This film had a good plot though, nothing you couldn't miss out on if you would simply read the novel that George Orwelll wrote. All I really want to say has already been said except for this: I can't believe that this film could have possibly received so many awards and nominations.I gave this film a One (awful), because I felt that it was very badly made.

189,AbuAmir,A Masterpiece after all,10,7 January 2007,"I love especially the scenes where the movie challenges the book and wins. For example, The scene of the Winston's arrest. In the book, the thought-policeman appears in the room as a young black haired man, after he was seen previously as an old white haired merchant. The movie does not need that brutality. It rejects the brutality. The old man remains old man with white hair, who climbs the stairs with difficulty. Yet, when he enters the room, the violent policemen stand still recognizing his dreadful might. He then addresses a policeman with no respect at all - ""Pick that up"", as a master to a slave. The scene where O'Brien offers Winston the fatal Goldstein's heresy. Again, the Orwellian scene is brutal and vulgar. In the movie, the same scene is gentle and sophisticated. O'Brien speaks nothing of Goldstein. He offers Winston a book disguised as a dictionary.Some shots are masterpieces of photography, such as the scene of mass hanging, and the Winston's visit to a whore. In the both scenes, the atmosphere is created by slow movement of the camera.In the hanging scene, the camera moves slowly away from the object. We see a victim, then another, then one more. Then there is a pause little longer, enough to make us hope it is only three. But then the fourth victim enters the frame, and we at once understand the number of the hanged may be indefinitely larger. In the Whore Visit scene, the camera moves in the opposite direction, coming ever closer to the whore. It beautifully illustrates the story which Winston dictates into his diary. At the beginning, the whore seems to be young. Then the camera gets closer and discovers the heavy makeup on her face. The camera moves on, and forces us to look upon her ugly genitalia, making us feel the ""smell of cheap perfume and dead insects...""The music alone is worthy of an Oscar.",1984
190,Fester213,"Great adaptation, with a very few minor disappointments",9,5 April 2003,"I'm a huge fan of Orwell, and especially 1984. I've read the book five times, and I just saw the movie for the first time. Before viewing, I was expecting to be upset because I didn't think anyone could really do a good job of putting the story into 120 minutes of film. I was wrong - the movie was almost perfect as a screen adaptation of the book. The moods, settings, characters, and themes are all captured perfectly. The only objections I had to the film come primarily from the ways in which I interpreted the book, and really didn't take away at all from the movie.(Spoilers follow)Firstly, I was a bit let down in the character of O'Brien. He seemed to come off as a standard inner party drone in the movie, while in the book there was the hint that he was actually very special and important. In the movie, when he tortures Winston, he seems to treat it as just another re-education. In the book, he clearly is impressed by Winston and treats him almost as a peer, even though he is still loyal to Party doctorine. Also, the movie took Julia out of the scene where they visit O'Brien, and therefore leaves out the part where they agree to commit all sorts of atrocities to bring down the party, which is an important point when O'Brien and Winston meet in the Ministry of Love. Thirdly, what was up with that green field? Maybe I just didn't get what the movie was trying to show with that. Finally, I was a bit miffed at the ending. There was far too much interaction between Winston and Julia at the chess table, even though the point that they can no longer care about one another was made. And the movie omitted the daydream-sequence of Winston getting shot at the very end. But even accounting for those few forgiveable flaws, it was a great adaptation, and viewed solely as a movie it would be perfect. 9/10.",1984
191,atombob,Supremely dark movie which echos the book well,10,26 May 2007,"I have read some people mentioning another adaptation of 1984 as a movie. I have to say I think it is a waste of time ! The John Hurt/Richard Burton version of 1984 is already the ultimate version. Seriously, could anyone improve on the performances given by these two, as well as the excellent supporting cast ? I hardly think so. John Hurt was without doubt the perfect choice as Winston Smith. First of all, he's English - and in the film portrays a cragged, disheveled and bewildered Smith - exactly as he was meant to be. There were no better performances anywhere that year and only the bleakness and content of the film stopped him from carrying away every honour conceivable within the film industry. Richard Burton's sheer presence, stony face and conviction is mesmerizing - he really does carry the message that Orwell wanted so well - that one really could make 2+2=5 if you can smash a persons spirit to dust and build them back up in the mould of choice. I fear for any remake. Just as War of the Worlds was bastardized again by Americans ( I'd love to see a proper version set in Victorian england ), I fear that it will be a Kevin spacey / Liam neeson nightmare set in new york. And that the human spirit wins out in the end - and Smith sees a BB poster crashing down in flames as he and Julia ( Jodie Foster ) head off into a free sunset to rebuild humanity. Seriously - can you imagine Hollywood making even a passable version of 1984 ?",1984
192,panblock,Disappointment,4,25 August 2010,"If you have read the book, then the movie will be a complete disappointment. It is an excellent book but in my opinion a below average movie. A lot of critical scenes have been omitted and others have been significantly altered (e.g. both Winston and Julia went to O'Brien. Winston never got the book that way!). I know that a movie can never be the same with the book but at least is should give you some similar joy. The book is a masterpiece. If you haven't read the book and haven't seen the movie either, then please read the book first! Otherwise you will probably hate the movie and never bother to read the book. And for the record, no I didn't even like the acting or the directing...",1984
193,mcginter,"""I went ahead and did it just the same......""",8,14 December 2002,"Couple of points:Doesn't give it a 'nice' Hollywood ending, which is a bonus. It was filmed at exactly the same period in April 1984 that the book was set in. etc......This is a truly evocative film. For me there is a big test of the film's quality: Nineteen Eighty-Four is my favourite book by my favourite author, and this version does that book great justice. Michael Radford did a very fine job on something that could have gone terribly wrong. Yes, there are some points to pick at(Newspeak isn't explained much, and the central plank of the book which O'Brien gives to Smith in his office is hardly mentioned at all), but these are minor things.Fans of Orwell's work have much to be thankful for in this interpretation. Graham Greene can lay claim (with Orwell) to be English fictions greatest writer, and there has not been a truly excellent version of any of his novels. (The Third Man does not count, as Greene wrote the screenplay first, and the novel second).On the whole I think Radford has done an excellent job with a fairly un-filmable book, and I give it 9/10",1984
194,BarryMusicTeach,Not nearly as good as the original,6,21 February 2010,"While this ""newer"" version more faithfully follows the book (which I've read at least 5 times) and paints the same picture of bleakness and control, I enjoy the original version much more. I disagree with the thoughts of a previous reviewer that the romance was primarily an effort to rebel against the party, though this version of the movie does seem to carry that bent with their cold, detached dialogue and constantly blank facial expressions. In the old version, it is indeed more romantic and even tugs at the heart a bit.Needless to say, the technology assumed to be present in 1984 is more accurate in this version - but, somehow, I think the original version captures the general ""feel"" of the book better than this one, even though the story is less tightly followed. It leaves more to the imagination and doesn't spell everything out the way the newer version does.The new version is quite monotonous and has no dynamics, while the older version hits me with more dramatic scenes. The ""Two Minutes"" hate scene is especially impactful with the rapidly changing camera angles, atonal music and lack of color. Then the sudden shift in flavor to the romance scenes makes the rest of the movie all the more bleak and hopeless.It really depends, however, on the point of view of the viewer. If you're one to pick apart movies and analyze plots, etc., then you may indeed like this version better. I'm by no means a movie expert and only know whether I enjoy watching it - and whether I want to watch it again. In general, I purchased the old version and watch it often, whereas I only made it halfway through the new version and don't care to give it another try. I had also rented this movie when it was popular, and didn't watch it to the end that time either.Like everything else, the modern version is more ""in your face, spell it out for me"" than the older version which was made at a time when people had a sense of delicacy and were willing to use their imaginations a bit to interpolate the missing pieces and, thus, interpret it their own way.In all, the newer version seems more suited to those who have not read the book or seen the original - for if they had, the newer version has little further to offer except color - and not much of it, which I'm sure was also intentional. But if a small number of color combinations helps to illustrate futility - then black and white does it better while also capturing the romantic feel of the days of old.",1984
195,abeynon19,The impact of the book is lost in translation to film,4,24 April 2012,"The best parts of 1984 are the parts that are nearly impossible to accurately translate effectively onto the medium of film. So this is a case where the book is so much better than a film adaptation ever could be. And this is odd because most people and especially most young adults have experienced many more movies than books, so its almost shocking to think that mere words can do what the whole multi-sensory experience of film cannot. Its not so much what the film did that was bad, but rather all the things it failed to do.The first thing it failed to do was provide much of a story background for the viewers of this imaginary futuristic totalitarian world. I assume they did not have the time to include it, but this really weakens the build up to the so-called climax of the movie. It seems the director is basically assuming that anyone watching the film has already read the book. But if you haven't I promise that you will be asking questions and be scratching your head almost right away.I had a small problem with the casting of John Hurt. He acted well enough, but he is a good 15-20 years older than the 39 year old Winston Smith was in the book. I'm not sure why they changed that aspect of the character. The movie also wholly misses out on Winston's internal psychological terror and painful introspective ruminations on the meaning and loss of history. I didn't get the sense that Winston really cared about history all that much. The movie focused more on his longing for amorous connections. If you saw this movie without reading the book you actually would get a small sense of what it would be like to live within the party where whole experiences are denied to you because language has been altered or obliterated. But you wouldn't know it. This is hard to explain.The acting was certainly adequate for everyone except O'Brien. Some of O'Brien's scenes from the book were removed from the movie so he actually had less to work with, but even his torture of Winston at the end seemed uninspired and rushed. And Winston's interactions with the enigmatic O'Brien is another area the movie really botched. In the book Winston is longing for a savior figure from the Brotherhood and he has this sense of doomed fatalism about him at all times. He reaches out to O'Brien knowing he is a dead man already, but the movie fails to build up that tension properly. The result is that the twist where O'Brien reveals himself as a member of the thought police is not climactic at all. Again, if you had not read the book you would probably just be confused rather than shocked. Now despite these shortcomings, I actually still enjoyed the movie even though so much of the emotional and psychological impact was lost. This was most likely due to the excellent set and consistent acting. But this is definitely a case where another remake is in order. I think with today's technique and technology they might be able to capture the essence of Orwell's timeless work. But I can only recommend this film to someone who has already read the book.",1984
196,gersonator,a very difficult film,5,21 October 2006,"I think this film was mediocre. But I do not hold a grudge. 1984 is my favorite novel of all time and I don't think I would have been satisfied with any film adaptation. 1984 is a very difficult novel to adapt to film. The most emotional passages are not spoken, and the concepts presented are too numerous and too complex to adequately convey in a film of reasonable length. Before I present any specific criticism, please allow me to say that the acting was masterful (especially Suzanna Hamilton, who was great in the role as well as being gorgeous) and the cinematography excellent. There are no glaring defects in the making of the film itself, and I do not mean to imply that.The film rushed over too many aspects of Oceanic life. There were too many ""setups"" left out, which gave the ""payoffs"" less impact: Winston's horror of rats is not adequately set up, nor is his queasiness about sex, nor are his struggles to discern what pre-revolutionary society might have been like. The distinctions between Party and proletarian life were not made clear, so the woman hanging laundry in the courtyard became meaningless. I think if I had not read the novel over and over again I would have been hopelessly lost in the film.The relationship between Winston and Julia had several holes. The subtleties of its formation were absent, as well as the harshness of its undoing. When they met after their re-education, they seemed almost cordial. There was nothing of the ""cauterized"" feelings of the book. And although their sexual relationship was portrayed vividly and splendidly, their conversations, which were so revealing and engrossing, were almost entirely excised. One of the key aspects of their relationship, which was not explored at all, was that they represented two different strategies of rebellion against the rule of the Party: Winston wanted to act directly against the Party if possible, or in any event to thwart their efforts; whereas Julia had almost a split personality--she used a strident and orthodox exterior to hide a personal lasciviousness, while caring nothing about whether the Party succeeded or not. Many people today face a similar internal struggle: Can the system be changed from inside? Do I make myself irrelevant by refusing to participate? Is there a middle ground? These mental struggles were absent from the film.In the film, the Party seemed evil and overbearing, but I did not get the sense of absolute control and helplessness that I got from the novel. The Ministries of Truth and Love were portrayed as being just as shabby as the rest of Oceania, when in the novel it was made clear that these were two places where the Party had really invested resources, so that they were ultramodern and efficient. O'Brien was not the awe-inspiring figure that he was in the novel. And his apartment, while cleaner and perhaps a bit nicer than Winston's, was not nearly different enough to make an impression--it looked more like an office. The meeting between Winston and O'Brien was dull and unmeaningful--in the novel, O'Brien is almost teasing Winston and Julia, though one only knows this in retrospect. He is filling them with a hope which he knows he intends to crush later. And the scenes in the Ministry of Love could have been a chilling, psychologically disturbing sequence, something like the Silence of the Lambs or 2001: a Space Odyssey or A Clockwork Orange. Notice two of those are Kubrick films--I think he could have made this film better.This film is not bad, but it's not good either. To get the full meaning and impact of Orwell's ideas, head straight for the book. Read it, think about it, read it several more times, and think about it a great deal more. Then you will begin to appreciate it.",1984
197,blake_morrisc,Good - but could be better?,7,5 July 2011,"1984 is a good film, but after reading the book I knew there were going to be issues with the film. With so little dialogue the book deals with one mans thoughts, one mans issues. There can be no real way to encapsulate that in a film. Left out are extracts like ""the problem with the 2 minutes hate is"", ""un-persons"", Winston knowing which of his friends are going to die long before they know it, the horrid spy children and the explanation of Winston's feelings toward O'Brian during the torture scene where they end in each others arms. All points that I feel detract from what is still a poignant movie highlighting what could happen if there was every a time when people gave up thinking.But on the other hand other aspects are amazing. The office Winston works in, the corridors, the walk home, the cafeteria etc, all as they should be. Gray, old, falling apart and depressing. And the face of BB is PERFECT.The film is good. I would recommend it to anybody with an active imagination and a cynical outlook. But I would recommend this film only if you have read the book. If you just watch the movie you may have a hard time. And you also do not get the extracts from Goldstein's book in the movie, which are worth a read at any time.",1984

The scenes are all snippets thus making it harder for the actors to live their role; although they did a good job I'm sure that if the scriptwriter had done a better job the film would have been a blast.my conclusion: It hasn't got the power it could have.

A while back a friend of mine told me there had been a movie remake of the book and of course I became incredibly excited. Fittingly enough around a week later my teacher revealed our next assignment which was writing and comparing 3 dystopian books, films or games of our own choice, And there's the reason I watched this movie.It is as previously said a brilliant transition from book to movie, one you rarely see. The strongest part of this film in my opinion was the skillful way they through the characters and environment was able to project this horrible picture of a controlling and oppressing society. Another strong point was how the main character didn't say much and most of the story was told through this overhanging voice, I think this even more adds to the image of the people being controlled. Also I think Richard Burtons role and acting is mere brilliance.",1984

It is amazingly shot, acted written, directed. I honestly think that this film was at least 10 years ahead of its time. I look at movies from the early 90's that are not shot this well. And the set design is beautiful. It is bleak and dreary and so oppressive. You can almost smell the nasty cold air. I have no complaints. It stays exceptionally true to the novel. of course some details are left out. So i suggest reading it and then seeing the movie. This is an all too important story not to be heard, even if we are not living under the shadow of Soviet Russia, people still need to heed Orwell's warnings about totalitarian governments.",1984
203,aayushsri,Movie > Book,9,20 February 2015,"The movie doesn't do justice to the book, is the usual refrain everybody hears. But I disagree, the success of a movie are the emotions you feel while watching it. I felt sad at the grayish feel, annoyed at the repeated announcement and pain at the torture of Winston. You don't get the usual Orwellian commentary over the issues, but I think watching a movie requires more mental effort than reading a book, only when it comes to the ""thinking"" movies like this one.That is quite a controversial statement, but my reason is simple. A book has the liberty to explain what the character is thinking, with 500-600 words. A movie instead has just 5 seconds to communicate that exact process. It takes more effort on the part of the audience to make sense of it. Of course you don't get the leisurely experience of enjoying a book, and have the author use literary techniques to build mental images over pages and pages. But somehow in good movies even despite the images you have a tougher task of getting inside the character's head. I like that.",1984

I bought the DVD out of sheer curiosity, Burton is an actor I hold in high regard so when I heard that he played the role of O'Brien I was swung.I watched the trailer on the DVD first and some fears started to set in, mostly regarding the frankly terrible ""Theme song"", hearing the Eurythmics mechanically shouting ""1984!"" over and over again to an electronic beat is as bad as it sounds.The acting on a whole is pretty good, Burton and Hurt play their roles well and the tension that exists in the Ministry of Truth towards the end can be felt, especially in the harrowing Room 101 scene. However this is also where the movie is let down. The movie spends too much time focusing on the Love affair between Winston and Julia, which frankly isn't what Orwell was writing about. He was writing about a harrowing future, about how Ingsoc build up a mans beliefs and then shatter them all in the name of him being made to love Big Brother. The movie skips over what is essentially the most important part of the book, Winstons coming to terms with his position in life and the world, and his re-education via O'Brien.The comment on IMDb at the moment states that the movie sticks to the book is completely incorrect. Julia is not present when Winston visits O'Brien, they do not commit themselves to Goldstien's Brotherhood and confess their crimes. There is no obvious mention of the initial instances where Winston finds the article with the Unpersons but it does get mentioned near the end, if you have not read the book it is completely confusing.A terrible screenplay, which some excellent acting cannot rescue. Michael Radford seems to have completely missed the point Orwell was trying to make, and the electronica sound track is frankly terrible.",1984
206,btrebing05,Not terrible...,5,2 June 2005,"I read the book 1984 before I watched the movie, and I loved the book. One of my favorite books, I had a helluva time imagining the entire story in my head. That being said, this isn't a terrible adaptation, it's just so radically different from what I had conjured up in my head that I can't stand to watch it. With that said, I'm not trying to say that this is a good adaptation either. The word ""average"" does a good job describing the film, which is a shame considering how great the book was. There are many good ""future dystopia"" novels, and I can't recall any of the others being adapted to the screen, so this is all you've got. If you have never read the book, and have no intention of reading the book, then the movie is worth watching, so that you get the message, but I HIGHLY suggest reading the book first; it's a much more enjoyable experience.",1984
207,jeremyhaymaker,Screenwriter fail,2,2 December 2018,Acting was great. The problem was the screenwriting. The film would be rated 0 for anyone who hadn't read the novel. Incredibly disappointed.,1984
208,grease_leaf,Worst adaptation of a book,1,6 November 2005,"A few weeks ago, I read the classic George Orwell novel, 1984. I was fascinated with it and thought it was one of the best books I've read recently. So when I rented the DVD, I was intrigued to see how this adaptation measured up. Unfortunately, the movie didn't even come close to creating the ambiance or developing the characters that Orwell so masterfully did in his book. The director seems to think that everyone watching the movie has read the book, because he makes no attempt to demonstrate WHY the characters act and feel the way they do. John Hurt, the main actor, is droll the entire way through, and hardly does any acting until the end. We never really find out what he does for a living, or why his love affair is forbidden, or what the political climate is and why the main character desires rebellion. This book cannot be done justice in movie form without proper narration and explanation of the political system oppressing the characters, and the fact that those are missing is the greatest shortcoming of this film. Besides that, John Hurt was a terrible casting choice, looking about 15 years older than the 39 year old Winston he was supposed to be portraying. On a more positive note, however, the rest of the cast was well chosen. It's just too bad they were put in such a horribly adapted film with the wrong lead actor. -Brian O.",1984
209,scottjghastings,Boring,1,6 April 2018,I can't believe I put myself though watching this garbage. The story line is vague at best and amounts to nothing but drivel.,1984
210,jaydworkman,Well Done,9,10 May 2018,"Great movie. It really galls me how far double speak and rewritten history, as potrayed in 1984, has eminated into 2018 America. I'm referring to the reviews that proclaim we are now in ""1984"" because of President Trump and his supporters. The exact opposite is true. Any sophomore should know that the Socialism potrayed in 1984 is a product of the left. Big government, tje destruction of religion and the family are all goals if Marx and Socialism. It is very scary how deep we've sunk.",1984
211,pascualsofiareina,Atrocious society,10,11 September 2018,"1984 bears a striking resemblance to the novel ""Nineteen Eighty-four"" written by George Orwell, which was first published in 1949. Directed by Michael Radford, the film was photographed in and around London in the course of April-June 1984 at the exact time and setting imagined by Orwell some years before. To my mind, it is one of the most thrilling movies I have ever seen. In this film, the leading actor John Hurt gives an unexceptional performance as Winston Smith, a man from the proletarian area, who is devastated and oppressed by a totalitarian government that uses power to control people through screens all day long in a near-future dystopia. All characters look consumed and tired because of the unstoppable agony this regime causes. Under the sight of Big Brother, Winston Smith, will not only experience conspiracy and torture but also, he will contemplate atrocities caused to humanity. The way the movie is filmed and, the mode visual angles are captured make us feel as if we were just standing in front or at the back of characters and, sometimes, they were talking to us. Thanks to this, we can perceive the main character flow of feelings and thoughts whenever he speaks and it makes us really appreciate the modernist literary technique stream of consciousness. This film also includes a marvellous photography and, its special colour process gives us the impression of being contemplating real paintings. In addition to this, the soundtrack created by Eurorhythms makes us really feel the anxiety and crude reality of the film. No matter if it is 2018, this gripping movie still depicts our society.",1984
