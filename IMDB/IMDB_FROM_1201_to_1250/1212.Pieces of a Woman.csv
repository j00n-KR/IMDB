0,SnoopyStyle,nice performances,7,9 January 2021,"A very pregnant Martha (Vanessa Kirby) and construction worker Sean (Shia LaBeouf) are happy together until a tragedy happens and they struggle with the aftermath. She has a complicated relationship with her mother (Ellen Burstyn).These are good to great performances. Kirby is terrific. Burstyn is her greatness as usual. LaBeouf is convincing. He is so convincing that I can't see any woman wanting to be in a relationship with him. I do wonder if the movie should check in with Eva every once in awhile. Maybe Martha should peep in on Eva in a scene or two. In many ways, this is Martha's movie and I think she would go search out for Eva.",Pieces of a Woman
1,kosmasp,Sum of her parts,9,26 April 2021,"Long lingering shots ... performances off camera and focus on the titular woman. This really is not an easy drama to watch - a journey of mostly pain and agony. Even if you don't know what the inciting incident is or will be, you can tell ... you can see it coming. It still does not take any of its impact. Nor the performances of everyone involved. This really is quite something.The central performance is amazing, I was surprised I did not know that Shia was involved in this too. And while he may sound like a slightly mellow ""do it"" Dude you may have seen either in videos or memes, his performance is as essential as anyones else.Very well cast and very well structured, the movie is as impactful as it can get. Watch it, just don't expect this to be a ""fun ride""",Pieces of a Woman
2,jboothmillard,Pieces of a Woman,7,28 March 2021,"This was one of the contenders of Awards Season I was looking forward to the most, having seen clips and Mark Kermode talking about it on BBC News, The Film Review. Basically, a happy couple in Boston, Martha (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Vanessa Kirby), an executive, and Sean (Shia LaBeouf), a construction worker, are expecting their first child. Martha goes into labour at their home and Sean calls their midwife, Barbara. Another midwife, Eva Woodward (Molly Parker), is sent in Barbara's place, as she is unavailable. Martha struggles with nausea and pain during contractions, but Eva is supportive, and Sean helps to keep her calm. When Martha reaches ten centimetres, Eva realises the baby's heart rate has dropped dangerously low. Sean asks Eva if they are safe to continue and Eva tells Sean to call an ambulance. Martha eventually gives birth to a baby girl who at first seems healthy. But shortly after, Eva notices the baby is turning blue and attempts to revive her as she stops breathing. Unfortunately, the child goes into cardiac arrest and dies before the ambulance arrive. The following month, Martha and Sean meet with a coroner. Sean is eager to find out what went wrong, while Martha is reluctant. They learn the cause of death has not yet been established but are told they were able to determine that the baby was in a low-oxygen environment. Proceedings against Eva have already started. Sean leaves, overcome with emotion, while Martha is almost emotionless and stays to talk to the coroner. She wants to donate the baby's body to science. Martha and Sean's relationship continues to be strained. The relationship between Martha and her mother, Elizabeth (Ellen Burstyn), a wealthy Jewish woman, and Holocaust survivor, also becomes strained. Elizabeth wants to have a burial and funeral for the baby, Both Martha and Sean remain deeply depressed. Sean later starts to have an affair, having sex with Martha's cousin, Suzanne (Sarah Snook). He is a former drug addict, he has been sober for almost seven years, but he starts using cocaine. Suzanne is the attorney prosecuting Eva; she informs Sean that a potential lawsuit against Eva could be very lucrative. A month later, at a tense family gathering at her home, Elizabeth tells Martha that she has to attend Eva's trial and blames Martha for her baby's death because she decided to have a home birth. Elizabeth then tells Sean that she never liked him before offering him a cheque for large sum of money to leave and never return. Martha drops Sean off at Logan International Airport and he leaves for Seattle. Months later, Martha testifies at Eva's trial. She is interrogated by the defence about the dangers and complications of a home birth as opposed to going to hospital, while the prosecution questions if she truly trusted Eva to do her job. After her testimony, the judge allows her to address the court. Martha finally becomes emotional about her baby, she says that no conviction or lawsuit is ever going to take away her pain, and she states Eva is not to blame for the death of her child. A month later, Martha scatters her daughter's ashes into the river from the bridge that Sean helped to build. Years later, a little girl climbs an apple tree, picks an apple, and eats it. This little girl is Martha's daughter, Lucy (Juliette Casagrande), she helps her down and they go inside together. Also starring Iliza Shlesinger as Anita Weiss, Benny Safdie as Chris, Tyrone Benskin as Judge, and Jimmie Fails as Max. Kirby gives a highly convincing performance as the middle-class mother who cannot bring herself to truly acknowledge what has happened, LeBeouf is good as her partner who goes down a dark path, and Burstyn is great as the domineering mother pressuring her daughter to take legal action. The opening twenty-four minutes is a brilliant unedited long take of a realistic labour scene, the story going forward monthly to see the aftermath of the child's death and the relationship breaking down is clever, it really draws you in, a terrific drama. Very good!",Pieces of a Woman
3,evanston_dad,Some Nice Later Moments,6,19 February 2021,"There are some nice moments late into the running time of ""Pieces of a Woman,"" but you may not think the payoff of those scenes is worth what you had to sit through to get to them.As anyone who knows about this movie already also knows, the opening is a lengthy and grueling one-shot scene of a homebirth gone wrong. Actually, that's not how the movie opens. There are a few brief scenes establishing the principal characters, namely Martha (Vanessa Kirby), her husband Sean (Shia LaBeouf), and Martha's domineering mom Elizabeth (Ellen Burstyn). These scenes quickly convey the dysfunctional family dynamic between this trio, and mostly warns the audience that all of these people are going to be pretty miserable to be around. The film then delivers on that promise. After the birthing scene, which wasn't as unbearable as I thought it would be aside from the vomit anxiety induced by watching Vanessa Kirby burp and almost throw up for 20 minutes, this movie becomes nothing but a mashup of marital misery, and reinforces my belief that you can have empathy for damaged people and understand how they became the way they are, but still not want to be around them.Martha finds some solace and healing very late in the movie, providing Kirby with a chance to convey an emotion beyond hollowed-out bitterness. Burstyn is masterful and has a monologue that has Oscar clip written all over it. LaBeouf is hopeless, as he always is. He's a truly disgusting actor and he only plays disgusting characters and it's a relief when he abandons his wife and leaves the film. I only wish he'd done it sooner.Kirby is being lauded for her performance, but she's limited by the material. We don't know anything about Martha before her trauma and anything we learn about her after is filtered through that lens. She's a character defined by her tragedy, and the movie makes it hard to care about her beyond the abstract care one would feel for any random person in similar circumstances.Grade: B",Pieces of a Woman
4,ferguson-6,the smell of apples,7,29 December 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. It happens sometimes, but rarely. A single sequence in a film is so profound or unusual or artistic or affecting, that it alone makes the film worth watching. Such is the case with the labor-birth-midwife scene in this film from real life partners, Hungarian director Kornel Mundruczo and writer Kata Weber. Much of it is an extended single continuous shot, and it occurs within the first half hour.The only set up we get is that the husband, Sean (Shia LaBeouf) is on the construction crew building a new bridge, and that his wife Martha (Vanessa Kirby) is extremely pregnant on her final day of work before maternity leave. A strained relationship with Martha's mother is evident as she buys the couple a minivan. At home, the couple seems excited about the upcoming arrival of their first baby. When her water breaks, they are initially upset that their midwife can't make it for a home delivery, but soon enough, Eva (Molly Parker), shows up as a replacement and takes charge. The remarkable sequence is filmed in tight shots that add to the tension and come across as ultra-realistic as Ms. Kirby's strenuous performance.The rest of the film follows the differing ways the couple, especially Martha, deals with the crushing emotional pain and unfathomable grief that comes with losing a child. It's the kind of tragedy that can tear apart a relationship and change, if not destroy, a person. Martha becomes isolated as she tries to make sense of something where logic doesn't apply. Sean is unable to connect with her, but falls into her mother's camp of seeking to avenge the pain. Oscar winner Ellen Burstyn plays Martha's domineering mother, and she is determined to make the midwife pay through jail time.The rest of the film can't match that birth sequence for tension, but the cast is superb in capturing the various faces of grief. Ms. Kirby is a revelation and she immerses herself in the role - something frequent movie watchers will immediately recognize. Whether she's huffing with labor pains, sniffing apples in a grocery store, or floating through days and nights in a state of numbness, we feel every bit of what she's processing. LaBeouf handles the initial pain very well, but he's let down by the script through the balance of the story. Ms. Burstyn and Ms. Kirby each get another chance to shine as they face off at a family dinner in Act 3. Supporting work comes from Benny Safdie (actor-director known for co-directing offbeat films with his brother Josh), Iliza Schlesinger as Martha's sister, and Sarah Snook as the prosecuting attorney (and family member).Scandal surrounds the project, not because of anything that happened during production, but instead due to the accusations Shia LaBeouf is facing from a former girlfriend. Separating the accusations from the performance is a choice each viewer will have to make on their own, and it can be noted that he, while a significant player in the story, is not the main focus. Chapter headings by month are used to assist us with knowing how much time has passed, and the under-construction bridge from the first scene acts as a metaphor in the film's final scene as the new reality is faced. Despite being a tough watch at times, and having a first act that sets an unsustainable bar, there is a lot to admire about the film. Martin Scorsese is listed as an Executive Producer and 3-time Oscar winner Howard Shore delivers a nice score. Living with loss is never easy, and at times seems impossible.In theaters December 30, 2020 and on Netflix January 7, 2021.",Pieces of a Woman
5,blanbrn,"Raw, dark, emotional film of loss and coming to terms with life.",6,9 January 2021,"""Pieces of a Woman"" is one hard and heartfelt like film that looks at the drain and trauma that one woman Martha(the wonderful Vanessa Kirby) deals with that being the loss of a just born infant. The opening scenes of the film were a raw and eye opening tough look at child birth as you the viewer are taken by the miracle only to be scared and torn by tragic means.Martha's life also is no bed of roses as her partner the rugged go against the grain blue collar Sean(Shia LaBeouf) is slowly drifting away from her. While Martha's mom Elizabeth(the great Ellen Burstyn) is one tough loving hard nosed stubborn do the right thing old school lady who wants justice against Martha's midwife. Thru all of the drama and pain this film is a take on dealing with loss and adjusting to truth and seeing life for what it is. Overall this picture is a look at the raw and tough grace ways of a woman, as it's made with a deep emotional performance from Kirby and a spiced up supporting turn from Burstyn make this film a watch.",Pieces of a Woman
6,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - Pieces of a Woman (2020) 8.1/10,8,31 January 2021,"""On the strength of Wéber's sober and distinctively female-oriented script, PoaW instantly takes audience aback from its daring gambit, before the movie's title crops up, Mundruczó virtuosically orchestrates a 20-odd minutes sequence to closely observe the aforementioned tragedy, a flurry of travails during a home birth, assisted by midwife Eva Woodward (Parker) and her partner Sean Carson (LaBeouf), Martha Weiss (Kirby) has difficulty in delivering her baby. When the bundle of joy is suddenly snuffed, the trio's lives will be forever altered. It is as visceral as one can (or at least, a male viewer can) relate to the oceanic pain a mother might endure during parturition, and cinematically, Mundruczó tries to reflect this simulated realism with a phlegmatic pace, DP Benjamin Loeb's hand-held camera is more steady than shaky in its serpentine routes, it is amazing how the camera's movement can be choreographed seamlessly on a dime.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",Pieces of a Woman
7,ThomasDrufke,Gut-Wrenching,8,6 July 2021,"Beginning with a truly remarkable ""one-r"" long take to the powerhouse performances from Vanessa Kirby and Ellen Burstyn throughout, Pieces of a Woman is a tough watch, but a worthwhile one that provides a heartwrenching tale of a woman trying to move on after an unspeakable tragedy.8.2/10.",Pieces of a Woman
8,Cineanalyst,Lament,4,8 January 2021,"""Pieces of a Woman"" seems to be exactly what many others are saying about it: a partly well-acted movie that would've made for a decent 30-minutes short film followed by more than an hour and a half that's not as compelling. I don't have much to add to that because this is generally superficial filmmaking wallowing in grief that inevitably falters into melodramatics, including yelling and speechifying--even a speech in a courtroom that rather ruins what was otherwise a powerful moment involving a photograph of the mother with her newborn. Even the some-20-minutes long take, technically impressive though it is, of the birth scene is more showy than profound. After the title appears 30 minutes in, though, and beyond the credits appearing letter by letter (in pieces, in other words--get it) and sequences divided by gaps in time (more pieces), the picture is exceedingly uncomplicated in construction. It becomes mere dull melancholy. Long with ruminative shots, but nothing intelligent to think about.But, sure, Vanessa Kirby plays quiet grieving with the best of them, especially when not required to suddenly emote excessively to demonstrate that grief. On the other hand, Shia LaBeouf goes the other typical direction in these movies, of booze, drugs and abusive outbursts and which is not helped at all by the star's real-life notoriety for the same. I suppose I prefer to see him in stuff not involving Transformers but this character is too far over-the-top in opposition to Kirby's relative restraint. Nothing particularly interesting is done with his job in bridge construction, either, beyond the obvious metaphor of ""resonance"" that their marriage clearly doesn't have. Although, I'm not even sure what Kirby's Martha does in her job except for perhaps that she received an office because, as evidenced by her entitled mother (Ellen Burstyn), she comes from money. Although I wouldn't be surprised if Burstyn, along with Kirby, receives awards attention, her character is nearly as ""boorish"" as LaBeouf's and is given dementia in the script because, I don't know, the filmmakers seemed to have forgotten to end the movie in a timely manner. ""Pieces of a Woman"" is a long slog with no payoff.",Pieces of a Woman
9,851222,Raw and true,8,20 June 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Pieces of a Woman"" (2020) is a drama which will stick with you for some time after watching it - and in a good ways. It is because of the intense and kinda jaw-dropping opening ~15 min. It is because of very strong performances by all involved, and very confident directing. Cinematography as well as music were very moody and kinda even haunting.Overall, ""Pieces of a Woman"" is a movie about love and loss, and how that shapes one.

10,cruise01,Powerful drama with great acting but loses itself as the movie goes on.,6,8 January 2021,"3 out of 5 stars.Pieces of a Woman is a fair drama film about a married couple Martha (Vanessa Kirby) and Sean (Shia Labeouf). As Martha is about to give birth at home. Calls for a midwife to help out. But things go horrible when the baby does not make it. Leaving the couple going through loss, grief, and struggling to move on.It was a decent story. Which can be relatable to cases with couples dealing with loss. It is a powerful drama film. Starts out great for the first hour or so. The direction is raw and does not hold back. The birthing scene is tough and filled with emotions. Can be a tearjerker.The performances is great with the cast. Vanessa Kirby did a phenomenal job with her role. And rest of the cast did a great job. Dealing with the struggle of loss.I did find the music score by Howard Shore to be kind of disappointing. Making the film feel kind of slow and tedious. Which after the first hour. It does feel slow moving. They could have edited the long running time better.It is a striking drama with great performances. But does feel a little dragged out. And long.",Pieces of a Woman
11,eddie_baggins,A brilliant opening gives way to a more generic trauma drama offering,6,21 March 2021,"Beginning with what can only be described as one of the most gripping, terrifying and well-executed movie openings in recent memory, Pieces of a Woman is a film that at first appears to be destined for great things but sadly Kornél Mundruczó's dramatic expose of loss and trauma can't quite recapture the strength of its first stretch as it flatlines out into a more by the numbers affair that never grips us like it should.Featuring an awards caliber performance from rising star Vanessa Kirby as expectant and then grieving mother Martha and another impressive turn from the recently on song Shia LaBeouf as her recovering alcoholic partner Sean, Pieces is a prestigious affair in ways and one of the more confronting Hollywood dramas of the 2020 crop but the best work of its performers and careful direction of Mundruczó can't make its rather dry character development and delivery work as it progresses in increasingly depressive territory.Throwing us headfirst into the films central concept of a home birth gone very wrong and the after effects of such a tragedy on those involved is a strong act from the film but after the films title card appears and we as an audience re-gain our collective breath the film begins to quickly stagnant into relationship and trauma drama 101 scenarios and sadly Kirby and LaBeouf don't get to play off one another as much as you would have liked to see as the films plethora of ideas and situations such as Sean's potential addiction relapse, a court cast against Molly Parker's nurse Eva and Martha's extreme personal struggles don't all combine together to create the cohesive whole that would've been befitting of the films initial impact.It's not to say that elements of the film aren't gripping in their own ways, whenever Kirby or LaBeouf take center stage its hard to look away, with it a joy to see Kirby in particular get her meatiest Hollywood role yet that showcases her immense abilities outside of TV shows such as The Crown or bit parts in films like Mission Impossible: Fallout or Hobbs and Shaw, but the film begins to very quickly feel like a collection of scattered scenes that Mundruczó is unable to explore to their full potential, even if quiet moments of grace and humanity within the film are heartbreakingly released, with a final scene to remember of particular note in this instance.At days end there are times where Pieces feels as though its close to greatness other moments where it feels like a merely going through the motions experience and while some are likely to be gripped by it more so than others and potentially even emotionally devastated by the events it depicts, one can't help but feel as though this effort represent a missed opportunity to create something unforgettable.Final Say -A solid drama that is worth seeing for its stunning opening and its central performances, Pieces of a Woman falters in the wake of its incendiary start to become a solid but unfocused run of the mill drama.3 bridges out of 5",Pieces of a Woman
12,matthewssilverhammer,1/4 of a perfect film,5,7 May 2021,"The first 30 minutes of this is a 5-star emotional sucker punch, a one-take birthing scene that's truly incredible. I've lived through a similar situation, & while mine ended happily, it's nearly unbearable to imagine how it could've so easily gone differently. It's heart-racing, shocking, intimate, loving, chaotic, & ultimately destroying. Unfortunately, the other 90 minutes are a slogging 1.5-star family melodrama. So as good as that first part is, the rest makes the devastation of it hard to justify sitting through.",Pieces of a Woman

Good acting performances as well.Any bad? The actor's chemistry is good, but not brilliant. I had hoped for brilliant of course...because it is an earth shattering drama, but somehow I could not fully sympathize with this couple's struggle after having lost their baby, because I could not really believe that they were a couple, because I was just missing that extra bit of acting magic, that makes me forget I am watching actors act..

16,paul-allaer,Stunning performance by Vanessa Kirby,7,10 January 2021,"""Pieces of a Woman"" (2020 release; 128 min.) brings the story Maetha and Sean. As the movie opens, it is ""September 17th"", and highly pregnant Martha is celebrated at a baby shower. The next day, Martha and Sean are at home, and ready for the baby's delivery, assisted by a midwife. The birth is difficult, and within a minute of arriving, the baby stops breathing...Couple of comments: this is the latest from Hungarian director Kornél Mundruczó, whose previous work includes the excellent 2005 film ""Johanna"". The script is from his Hungarian wife Kata Weber. (Martin Scorsese is credited as Executive Producer.) We all have see baby delivery scenes in movies. Let me tell you: this particular baby delivery scene is unlike any other I have ever seen in a movie, period. It is by far the best and most compelling sequence in the movie, lasting a good 15-20 minutes. The movie then looks at the fall-out for all involved... None of this would be possible without the stunning lead performance by British actress Vanessa Kirby, best known for her tv work on ""The Crown"". Martha's mother is played by none other than Ellen Burstyn, who gets some great screen time. I had no idea that Sean's character was played by Shia LaBeouf until the movie's closing credits were rolling. Completely unrecognizable. The movie's photography is quite good (with Montreal standing in for Boston). But when all is said and done, one cannot stop thinking about Kirby's performance. If there is any justice, she will earn a Beast Actress Oscar nomination (assuming that the Oscars will even go forward this year).""Pieces of a Woman"" premiered at the Venice film festival last September to good acclaim, and Netflix promptly snapped it up. The movie was released in late December for a limited theater run, before shifting over to Netflix. Thankfully my art-house theater here in Cincinnati slated it, and the Saturday early evening screening where saw this at turned out to be a private screening. I was literally the only person in the theater. Regardless, if you are in the mood for a heavy duty family and relationship drama featuring some outstanding performances, none more so than Vanessa Kirby, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (if you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",Pieces of a Woman
17,jtindahouse,"Mesmerising, powerful and yet never overdone",10,23 March 2021,"For some morbid reason I absolutely love an emotionally devastating movie. And make no mistake, 'Pieces of a Woman' is a heavy movie. Even though child birth is not something I've ever played a role in, I felt every single thing the characters did in this film. That's how well this film was made. We aren't just watching people go on a journey, we are taking it with them.The film has a nearly 25 minute one-shot early scene, and it's one of the best scenes I have watched in a film in a long time. The acting, the camerawork, the scene structure, the dialogue and the emotional pay-off are truly mesmerising. The only problem with having a scene this good this early in your film is that the rest of the film can feel a little bit flat by comparison (even though the rest of the film is also top-notch).Vanessa Kirby has been nominated for Best Actress at the Academy Awards and it is well deserved. She is captivating to watch here. This would not be an easy role by any measure, because a lot of what her character is feeling is not on the surface. We have to know she is devastated even though her character is clearly hiding it. Both Shia LaBeouf and Ellen Burstyn are also excellent in the film and deserve a lot of recognition.One thing I loved about this movie was that it never felt overdone. It never felt like it was going out of its way to impress the audience with over the top theatrics and overly heavy emotional scenes. It's all there, but it is so much more subtle than other films of this nature tend to produce. This is one of the best films I've seen from 2020 and one I would highly recommend people watch.",Pieces of a Woman
18,alindsay-al,A Good Serious Film,7,8 January 2021,"This film has had plenty of critical acclaim to it but hasn't been available to see and now Pieces of a Woman has come to Netflix and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a woman hit by a personal tragedy and how she reacts to it and attempts to live her life over the next year.Main Character
Vanessa Kirby plays the lead here and she does a fantastic job here, she is so great in her role and you really sympathise with her and feel bad for her as she attempts to get on with her life. There has been Oscar buzz about her performance and she does enough here for that to be deserved and let's hope she gets recognition for this performance as it is really strong.Supporting Characters
I am going to look past the real life issue with Shia LaBeouf and just talk about his acting here and I thought he was really good here. I thought the dynamic between him and Kirby was interesting and well handled, you see there different reactions and coping mechanisms and yes it makes him more unlikeable but you kind of see where he is coming from with his grief, though the film fails with the way his character ends up. Ellen Burstyn plays Kirby's mother and is also good here, she owns the screen and her scenes with the other two main characters are gripping and that is because of her quality. All the other performers do a good job too and the best part of this film is the acting for sure.Story
The story is quite gripping and does a good job in showing how tragedy can affect people in different ways. Also the first half an hour and had me on the edge of my seat just as much or more then any big action film could and credit has to go to the actors and director for achieving that. But the issue this film has is that it can't keep the pace and intrigue up and falls flat after the first 30 mins, it's still fine but it just coasts by and doesn't do enough to stand out.Script
The script is okay with a few really dramatic scenes in it but this film is really grim which is understandable because of its subject matter but the humour it attempts does fail pretty badly. Also there are certain elements of the plot that feel a bit forced and I do wonder why they were included here, maybe just to get the film to the 2 hour mark.Style
As I said before the first 30 minutes is filmed brilliantly and the style for it adds so much to the whole thing and adds to the whole drama. Though the film slow in its pacing after that and as I said above I think there were a few parts of the plot that were unnecessary and that doesn't help with the pacing of the film as a whole.Overall
Overall, this is a really well acted film that is well directed that ends up being a good film. It doesn't do enough to hit the really high levels but is a good film if you can deal with the serious subject matter.",Pieces of a Woman

22,masonfisk,A HARD HITTING DRAMA NOT FOR EVERYONE...!,8,25 April 2021,"A Netflix original from last year starring Vanessa Kirby (currently nominated for an Oscar Best Actress) & Shia LaBeouf. Kirby & LaBeouf are about to have a child. She works in an office & he's a blue collar bridge man (& also recovering addict) but things are looking up since they live in an upscale apartment & are about to have a midwife over, played by Molly Parker, instead of going to the hospital to precipitate the birth there but things go bad (their girl's birth is a complicated one & she dies a few minutes after breaching the womb) sending the couple into a perpetual funk where they try to assess blame to the pain they're feeling. Kirby's mother, played by Oscar winner Ellen Burstyn, & sister, played by comedienne Iliza Shelsinger, have brought a law suit against Parker, using another family member, played by Succession's Sarah Snook, while LaBeouf has been sidelined by Kirby sexually & finds solace in Snook's arms (Kirby teases a relationship w/a co-worker played by Jimmie Fails from The Last Black Man in San Francisco). The bottom half of the film (told in monthly passages) details (excruciatingly so!) how a family deals w/the worse tragedy they can imagine & every emotion (anger, sadness, blame, impotence, etc) get their due & the audience is an active participant as witnesses. Not an easy watch to be sure but the performances (especially Kirby who will hopefully get catapulted into the forefront of important parts in the future) keep the narrative organically flowing w/subject matter (much like Marc Foster's Everything Put Together from 20 years ago which also dealt w/an expectant couple's tragedy) which is a byproduct of our pandemic'd haze & reality. Look for Bennie Safdie (one half of Safdie brothers directing team) here playing Schelsinger's car dealership beau.",Pieces of a Woman
23,valleyjohn,Amazing performances,8,14 January 2021,"Before I had kids I was always told that being at the birth of your child was one of the most wonderful things you can experience. They were absolutely wrong .
I found it stressful, painstakingly slow and quite frankly, revolting in all sorts of ways.Pieces of a Woman is a brilliant portrayal of what can go wrong during childbirth and how it affects everyone .When a young mother's home birth ends in unfathomable tragedy, she begins a year-long odyssey of mourning that fractures relationships with loved ones in this deeply personal story of a woman learning to live alongside her loss.This is not a happy film . In fact it's bloody grim, so if Lockdown is getting you down then this probably isn't for you.I thought it was great .The fist twenty minutes of this are extremely stressful to watch . Not unlike being at a real childbirth.
The way it's filmed makes everything feel extremely real and that is mostly down to our two lead actors , Vanessa Kirby and Shia LeBeouf .They are fantastic. I'm not a fan of LaBeouf normally but this is by far and away his best performance
Vanessa Kirby is off the scale . If she doesn't get recognition during the award season then there is no justice.Both totally feel like they are partners . Sometimes it's all too real , especially the scene where Sean tries to have sex with Martha . That is a very uncomfortable scene to watch but by then we've already seen unspeakable grief and upset .I know I probably haven't made this film seem appealing to watch but you should . It's very good .I know it's only half way through January but this is my favourite film so far of 2021 .",Pieces of a Woman
24,jadepietro,A Broken Woman,8,14 January 2021,"IN BRIEF: Strong acting and direction fills in the some of the narrative gaps.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) Pieces of a Woman is the feel-bad movie of the year (but in a good way), especially if you like your dramas with a tragic sting. This intense film is not for the faint of heart. The subject matter is disturbing and brutally real. Director Kornél Mundruczó sensitively handles the serious subject of loss as a couple start the grieving process from two completely different directions: one becomes filled with rage and anger; the other emotionally distant.Nearly the first half hour of this film is a grueling endurance test for the actors and the moviegoing audience. Shot in one take, the film shows a childbirth session gone terribly wrong and its aftermath. After that point, the film settles down to a character study of a broken woman, unable to feel or react in any positive way. We empathize with her circumstances but continue to wonder why she and her husband never seek counseling or a support group of other parents in similar quandaries. That point is lost in Kata Wéber's screenplay which has many strong moments but it also drifts to improvisational dialog and sketchy character development.Mr. Mundruczó's direction is solid, especially his inclusion of quieter observational touches (co-worker's stares, a sweater stained with breastmilk, dead plants hanging in windows, etc.). Yet, the character's back stories remain incomplete and their rocky relationships only hint at their dynamics.The acting is superb. Shia LaBeouf delivers a fine performance as Sean, a character flawed from the start. As he deals with sobriety and anger issues, his emotion arc never rises beyond that damaged persona as written. His character gets short shrift and needs more scenes between him and his wife, Martha, to paint a clearer picture of their bond. The great Ellen Burstyn is Martha's rich and domineering mother and more time is given between her and her daughter. This enhances the film greatly and their confrontation scene is truly excellent.At the heart of the film is Vanessa Kirby as Martha. The actress makes her character so vulnerable in her unflinching portrayal of this injured soul. Much of this remarkable performance is internal reactions with passing fits of rage. Let us hope that Ms. Kirby (and Ms. Burstyn) will not be overlooked this award season.I strongly recommend this film, but it comes with a stern warning: Pieces of a Woman is a gut-wrenching film that some will love and others will not be able to endure. Choose your moviegoing experience accordingly. (GRADE: B)",Pieces of a Woman

26,nancyldraper,Emotionally exhausting,7,26 October 2021,"The performances in this film, especially by Vanessa Kirby and Ellen Burstyn, are a masterclass in acting. The emotional intensity of the subject matter is relentless and exhausting. Ellen Burstyn has a monologue that will never leave you. Despite the 10 out of 10 performances, this is not a movie I would watch twice and, indeed, I was hesitant to get lost in it the first time as I knew it would be an emotional marathon.

Laced with brilliant performances by Vanessa Kirby and Shia Labeouf. The movie never lives up to it's opening scene, it gets all muddled inbetween with not directly facing the loss by characters to going at eachother like Nicole Kidman's brilliant Rabbit Hole. Instead it focuses on the grandmother, the mother and father but in a way you have no idea where it's heading.In the end, it does picks up a bit in courtroom and ends on a decent note. However, I wish the screenplay was better, the whole subplot of Shia being poor etc etc was unnecessary. I wished the script had taken more bold approach to dealing with loss rather than characters just thinking in their heads finding solace in others rather than talking about it.",Pieces of a Woman
28,Xstal,"A Woman Fractured, Disintegrated, Through a Story Attenuated...",7,7 January 2021,"The lives of two people decimated with the loss of their newborn baby girl. Grabbing the viewers' attention from the off, as every parent's nightmare is lived out in graphic detail at the close of a thirty minute escalation that lays the foundations for a bridge to the unimaginable, a trajectory paved with chaos, veiled and shrouded in turmoil, suspended on tenterhooks as tense and as taught as Tacoma. With anticipation and expectation set, it's a little disappointing to find this resonance, once established and secured soon decays and rapidly fades, from the deeps to the shallows, as the story begins to mainstream with its contemporaries, as opportunity, empathy and originality are lost and the only structure left standing embodied through the performance of Vanessa Kirby, who will surely go on to much bigger and better crossings.",Pieces of a Woman

A fully complex and realized female character who's made a terrible mistake and is afraid of making another one. Receiving bad advice from all ends, what is she to do? The standout sequence, that almost goes without saying, is the birth scene. It's not graphic and it's not gratuitous. It's tragic and beautiful depiction of a failed home birth. Vanessa Kirby's performance here is incredible. It's impossible to imagine how anyone could get it as right as she did.

30,bankofmarquis,Realistic view of grieving,8,16 April 2021,"Films about grief are a tricky proposition, for while they can be cathartic and life-affirming, they can also be dour, depressing experiences that spiral downward under it's own weight.Fortunately, PIECES OF A WOMAN avoids wallowing in it's own melancholy and gives the audience a thoughtful, heavy, exploration of grief and what grief does to a dysfunctional family.Written by Kata Weber, who wrote this as a way to deal with her own grief, PIECES OF A WOMAN tells the tale of how a family deals with a tragedy when a home birth goes ""horribly wrong"" (not spoiling anything here, it's in the marketing material).I was fearful going into this film that we would be subjected to an intense, bloody butchery of a home birth, but Director Kornel Mundruczo and actors Vanessa Kirby, Shia LaBeouf and the always good Molly Parker gives us a loving, caring, intense and (ultimately) sad and tragic beginning to the film.And then comes grief...and anger...and blame...and isolation.Sitting squarely in the middle of all of this is Vanessa Kirby (Princess Margaret in the first 2 seasons of THE CROWN) in her Oscar Nominated turn as the birth mother in the middle of all of this. We follow her as she drifts in oblivion while those around her try to tell her what to do and how to feel. It is a haunted, holisitic, realistic portrayal of a person who just wants to fade into nothingness rather than feel the tragic loss.Shia LaBeouf (TRANSFORMERS) proves, once again, that he can act as the husband/father. His character, Sean, is impotent to prevent the tragedy, care for his wife and deal with his own grief. He, too, creates a real character and the interplay between husband and wife are all too realistic.The great, Oscar-winning Actress Ellen Burstyn (the mother in THE EXORCIST) is on board as the domineering mother of Kirby's character who demands that someone pays for the death of the child. This is the type of showy-role that an aging, revered actress is normally Oscar nominated for and I am surprised she was not (especially because an added layer was added to her character that makes her, as well, realistic).Credit for all of these performance has to go to Director Mundruczo for steering this ship away from maudlin and melodrama and squarely into the real world. It's not a perfect Directing job as the film does tend to dwell on the grief and Kirby's character does spend a good deal of time looking out the window while a solo piano plays single notes, but those are nits on an otherwise solid effort.All-in-all I was pleasantly surprised at how moving - and real - this film is. You have to be in the mood for this movie (grief is not a happy subject) but you will be rewarded with a strong look at grief and it's affects.Letter Grade: A- (I could have used a few less moments of looking out the window to tinkling of the piano keys)8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",Pieces of a Woman

The actors and how it was directed doesn't dumb down the story by over explaining everything. It was those subtle looks, perfect timing and body language of the actors that sold it for me.

34,kjproulx,"Almost Too Brutal at Times, but Very Powerful",9,17 September 2020,"This is a film that will be on my mind for a while. It's hard to enjoy a movie that's incredibly depressing, but Pieces of a Woman is one that I got behind. All I feel like doing is raving about how good this movie truly is, but I need to stress that I probably won't recommend it to most average viewers. Having just premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, Pieces of a Woman took me on a journey that I wasn't prepared for in the slightest. Here are my overall thoughts on this very challenging film.The premise of this film alone kind of ruins the experience to dive into it in detail, so I'll simply say that this film is about Martha (Vanessa Kirby), a woman who has to cope with a devastating loss. This loss drives a huge steak in the love between her and Sean (Shia LaBeouf), so much so that their relationship may not work out. Pieces of a Woman begins with an absolutely gut-wrenching 30 minutes that sets the rest of the film in motion. The opening of the film made me smile and it felt sweet, but the quick descent into heartbreak just left my jaw on the floor. In retrospect, this movie isn't for anyone who is looking to genuinely enjoy a film, but rather an experience that utilizes filmmaking and performances in the best ways possible.I've been a Shia LaBeouf fan for as long as I can remember, so his fantastic and raw performance here didn't surprise me in the least. He's been great in everything he's done over the last few years and I can't wait to see more indie turns from him. Now, Vanessa Kirby on the other hand... I've seen her in big films like Mission: Impossible - Fallout and Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw, but I've never seen her sink her teeth into a role like this. Maybe there's a smaller film that I need to seek out that she's done in the past, but this may be the best performance she'll ever give. From her first moments on-screen to where she ends up by the end, her range here was outstanding. I felt the emotion that she was conveying and I broke down in a certain courtroom scene.Now, where I feel the one imperfect aspect of this film lies, is in the fact that the first 30 minutes are so incredibly moving, that the rest of the movie does seem to move at a much, much slower pace. Once the big moment occurs, Pieces of a Woman almost teeters on being a little too melodramatic and slow. With that said, the camerawork by Benjamin Loeb is a character in itself. Incredibly long takes bring you on a journey themselves and it took the overall story to another level for me. Having done the cinematography for the film Mandy, I guess that shouldn't have surprised me so much. It's very clear that Loeb has a keen eye on what will work for a specific film and what won't. I'm eagerly awaiting his next project.In the end, Pieces of a Woman is probably the most challenging movie I've watched all year. Not only due to how depressing the story itself is, but how slowly the film moves along. It asks you to be patient and really dive into the emotional core, which I ended up finding incredibly powerful overall, even though the subject matter was almost too much to take in at times. The graphic nature of how certain things are displayed almost had me in tears alone. This is a film that doesn't hold back. It tells you the honest truth about situations like this and I found that very powerful. Not many viewers will be able to sit through this movie and want to call it great, but that's exactly what I believe it to be. A great, great piece of drama, even if it's brutally hard to watch.",Pieces of a Woman
35,tm-sheehan,Long movie excruciating long birth scene 30 mins,6,21 March 2021,"My Review - Pieces of a WomanMy Rating 6/10
My Review will be brief as I really only watched this movie to see Vanessa Kirby in her Academy Award nominated role as Martha who loses her baby shortly after a natural home birth.
I suspect women will view this movie more sympathetically for obvious reasons predominantly my sex and the fact that I've never had the experience of giving birth. Interestingly either has the Star of the movie Vanessa Kirby .
Like any Actor researching a film role she watched numerous documentaries and videos and shadowed midwives in a hospital in North London and even was allowed to be in a room with a woman who was giving birth.
This film apparently holds the record of the longest birth scene in any film The opening thirty minute birth scene took two days and six takes to shoot.
I can't say I enjoyed or was entertained by this movie . Did I learn anything from it?
I've learnt enough about the complications of child birth by watching all Seasons of the excellent series Call the Midwife but this film did convince me that the risk to mother and child of home birth is not worth it when a well equipped hospital is the other option .
Not one of the cast of characters in this film seemed to like or support each other .
The Mother played by wonderful Ellen Burstyn pays Martha's husband to leave her, actually I don't blame her he's a clutz.
Vanessa Kirby is obviously a very good actress but I can't believe that the British Academy chose her for a BAFTA nomination instead of their own brilliant Carey Mulligan.
The fact about this film I disliked the most was that the family blamed the midwife who obviously was just providing her services at the birth and does act promptly when she realises a Doctor and hospital are urgently needed.
Martha's family seem only interested in the American buzzword litigation and want the midwife to suffer so go to court expecting a huge payout from the American Justice System .
The parents chose to have a home birth ,no spoilers but the conclusion is worth the angst of the film.
I've seen all the best 5 nominated actresses this year for the Academy Awards and my top 3 in order are Andre Day, Carey Mulligan and Frances McDormand.",Pieces of a Woman
36,msbreviews,"PIECES OF A WOMAN holds one of the most emotionally shocking opening acts of the last few years, and a career-best performance from Vanessa Kirby!",8,7 January 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I've never seen a movie from Kornél Mundruczó, but Pieces of a Woman started getting the usual awards buzz that comes with this time of the year. Once Netflix grabbed the distribution rights, it was just a matter of time until I got the chance to watch yet another Oscar-bait. I didn't really think about it nor created any sort of expectations besides hoping it would be good. Vanessa Kirby (Mission: Impossible - Fallout, Hobbs & Shaw) and Shia LaBeouf (Honey Boy) are the protagonists of a story that will connect with many people around the world, especially couples who went through the same situation. I'll write it straight away: it's undoubtedly one of the best films I've seen this past year.How does it stand in comparison with the other marvelous movies? I'll have to think about it when organizing my Top10, but Pieces of a Woman possesses the best opening act I've seen in quite a long time. For thirty full minutes (even before the title card shows up), an entire birth scene is delivered through excruciatingly long, uninterrupted takes, which ultimately make the whole sequence feel like a phenomenal oner. Technically, the entire film is brilliantly directed by Mundruczó, who takes advantage of the superb cinematography from Benjamin Loeb and Howard Shore's beautiful score to offer the viewer an emotionally powerful viewing experience.As fantastic as the technical attributes may be, Kata Wéber's exceptionally well-written, detailed screenplay is really elevated by the incredible cast, notably its leads. Without the shadow of a doubt, Vanessa Kirby gives her career-best performance, demonstrating an emotional range I genuinely believed she didn't have. Martha's arc ends up being a tad predictable and formulaic as some other characters' arcs and portions of the narrative, but I never felt less invested in the story due to that. In fact, I can't remember the last movie that brought tears to my eyes before the end of the first act, which serves as a statement of the film's realism and authenticity.Shia LaBeouf might have also delivered his best interpretation ever, even though I truly love a couple of his past displays. Once again, the actor brings his A-game, demonstrating the talented acting skills that make him one of the most underrated actors working today, in my opinion. A particular aspect of Sean's arc left me a bit dubious of its necessity and/or importance to the narrative, but just like Kirby's character, I was always interested in their path. Molly Parker is also excellent as the midwife involved in the tragedy, while Ellen Burstyn portrays Martha's mother, Elizabeth, leaving me deeply surprised by her outstanding performance. 88 years old... Magnificent.Despite the highly expected developments and respective conclusions, the ending shares a touching revelation involving a particular trait from Kirby's character that hit me really hard. The best aspect of the entire movie has a negative side effect, though. After such a mesmerizing, powerful, shocking first act, the rest of the film never quite reaches the same level of investment and immersiveness that the initial thirty minutes are packed with. Don't get me wrong, it's still a remarkably captivating narrative, filled with significant messages of forgiveness, acceptance, fairness, and another take on the ""moving on"" matter.It will be extremely hard to watch for many people, but it's that realistic environment that left me speechless and surprisingly emotional right from the get-go. It might not be a movie that I'll rewatch countless times or even recommend to every single reader. Nevertheless, Pieces of a Woman carries an undeniably impactful story that tons of viewers will share a deep connection with, which every filmmaker tries hard to accomplish. Ultimately, concerning my Top10, it will come down to how much I value its immense quality vs. its low replay value.All in all, Pieces of a Woman becomes a worthy awards contender, holding one of the best opening acts of the last few years. With astonishing direction from Kornél Mundruczó, the first thirty minutes are packed with extreme levels of anxiety and stress due to the emotionally shocking birth sequence, which is played out through excruciatingly long takes. Vanessa Kirby and Shia LaBeouf deliver their career-best performances, handling extensive monologues effortlessly, but it's the former who leaves me mind-blowed at her emotional range, which induced tears in my eyes even before the title card. Kata Wéber's exceptional screenplay is brought to life in a remarkably authentic, immersive manner, leaving me incredibly captivated by its characters, despite the formulaic and predictable arcs. Huge praise to Howard Shore's wonderful score, and Benjamin Loeb's terrific camera work, as well as Molly Parker and Ellen Burstyn's excellent displays. I highly recommend it to anyone who'd love to watch an emotionally investing story with phenomenal acting but be advised: it can extremely hard to watch at times.Rating: A-",Pieces of a Woman
37,Alexander_Blanchett,Thrilling,9,7 January 2021,"Incredibly touching, moving and heartwretching movie that really reached my core. Great story, which is hardly ever shown on screen like this, although it is not uncommon. Good characters and especially fantastic performances. First of all we have Vanessa Kirby who turns into one of the absolutely best performances of the year. Kirby was already great on ""The Crown"" where she showed her potential but here she shows her fully capacity and with this film becomes one of the most interesting actresses of her generation. What a powerhouse performance, what a difficult performance! She mastered it so well. Also Shia LaBeouf again showed of his great talent. Sure his character was at some points unlikeable and sometimes he overdid it a little but in the essence it was a very good performance. And then there is Ellen Burstyn who might have been a bit too old to be cast as Kriby's mother but thankfully she was chosen anyway so we were able to witness another fantastic and memorable performance by the great Burstyn that surely can bring her late Oscar glory again. The rest of the cast is great too and it is in general a beautiful ensemble piece. I really loved the direction too which doesnt get too much notes but the way Kornel Mundurczo shot the film was unique on its own. Alone the big scene at the beginning almost in one shot is an incredible achievement and he continues with that style throughout the whole film. That, the beautiful screenplay and great score round it up to one of the best films of the year that not only lives though Kirby's unforgetable performance but stands on its own foots very, very well.",Pieces of a Woman
38,garethcrook,Devastating.,8,12 January 2021,"Be warned, this is a real emotional gut wrencher. Martha (Vanessa Kirby) and Sean (Shia LeBeouf) are having their first baby. I'm gonna come straight to it, both are amazing. This is not an easy story and they both come off remarkably natural, they nail it. Births on screen are usually brief aren't they. Not here. Prepare yourself for a gripping and intimate rollercoaster that covers the entire opening act. It's really intense, I mean REALLY INTENSE! Apparently Kirby doesn't have children yet, hasn't done this for real. You'd have no idea, she's... pick a superlative. In fact pick all of them. I'd be remiss not to mention Eva (Molly Parker) too who's the midwife at their home birth. She's not Barbara as they'd planned, but Barbara is already with someone else in labour. It's bad luck, sometimes plans change. It is not going to be the only thing that doesn't go according to plan though. There's a little close up on Eva, a tiny shake of the head, a look in her eyes. It's heartbreaking. In that moment you're praying for that first cry. That confirmation that it's going to be okay. I'm not going to go into detail. Maybe it would be too much of a spoiler, maybe it's just to painful to describe. It's not going to be okay. Where do go from there? In a film. In life. When you lose a baby like that. Your world is ready for someone that's not there. Down a deep dark hole. The weight of the loss, a thousand minor details thrown in on top. It's a hard watch as the couple and their extended family struggle to cope. Cope with the loss. Cope with who's at fault. What's at fault. Is there fault. For all the intensity of that opening act, what follows is a slow visceral slog of people coming apart. We want them to find peace. Get answers. Rebuild. Sometimes though, that doesn't happen. Different people cope in different ways. Martha and Sean are different. She retreats, closes up. He becomes more unstable. LeBeouf does unstable rather well. For the dramatic weight and maybe even importance of this story. It's not a perfect film. There's nothing wrong with the acting, the cinematography, the music, all the mechanics are spot on. There's nothing particularly wrong with the plot. It's just that it gets bogged down a little with disagreements that although honest, do struggle a little on screen. They trigger issues around class snobbery in the family and parental control, all underpinned by money and a looming court case against the accused responsible midwife. I am really loathed to say anything negative about it though, it feels like an important film, even if it wobbles a little. Apparently director Kornél Mundruczó and his partner had something of a similar experience. I don't know how similar, but it certainly feels that large parts of this come from a personal painful truth. Responsible for the excellent White Gods, Mundruczó certainly knows how to punch a hole in your emotions. It's terrible thing to happen to anyone and you just hope that those it does happen to, that they have good supportive people around them. Truly supportive. Sadly the characters here are not in that situation and it makes for difficult viewing.",Pieces of a Woman
39,Stanlee107,A woman's torn,6,23 January 2021,"This is a powerful, emotional film that captured the joys of home birth & the despairs of tragedy thereafter. The first scene is the most potent scene in the film but given what an emotional rollercoaster that was I had high expectations.However, to achieve such feats it requires a great script. It becomes a bit of a melodrama & its brilliance faded towards the end. Nevertheless is it worth a watch if you like an emotional film with character driven storyline.",Pieces of a Woman
40,ronakkotian,Heartbreaking...,8,8 January 2021,"I heard about this film when Vanessa Kirby bagged a Best Actress award at the Venice Film Festival and so I was curious to see how good she will be. I believe this is her best performance yet.Pieces of a Woman follows Martha, a woman about to give birth to a child. Unfortunately the home birth ends in tragedy, leaving her with immense grief as she distances herself from her partner Sean and her family.This is one of those movies that leave you heartbroken all the way through and Pieces of a Woman did a great job making me feel the pain that Martha was going through over the course of the film. The film has an extremely strong opening with a one take scene that lasts around 25 minutes. It's intense throughout, handled in a very meticulous manner and the performances make it feel all the more real. Vanessa Kirby gives her best performance to date with this film and the amount of work she put in for that opening alone proved to me how great of an actress she is. I think she should get an Oscar nomination for her work here.The opening sets a high bar for the film and the rest of the film doesn't reach that exact level but I still found it to be incredibly upsetting. Seeing Martha slowly push away the people she loved was sad to watch and I liked the slow burn aspect since it allowed me get inside the mindset of each character and feel the same emotion they were feeling. Kornél Mundruczó's direction is solid. There are some fantastic long takes where the actors were given opportunities to shine which made up for some very emotional and memorable scenes. Shia LaBeouf gives one of his best here and Ellen Burstyn is also fantastic. There is one particular moment where she gives it her all and I wouldn't be surprised if she also got an Oscar nomination alongside Kirby.The music was pretty good and used sparingly but there were some scenes which I felt could have been better had they not played the music during them. Despite that, I found Pieces of a Woman to be a very depressing journey with excellent performances and I found its slow pacing to be effective in maintaining the grief and misery.",Pieces of a Woman
41,andrewroy-04316,Kirby delivers the performance of the year in an emotional but uneven film,7,19 January 2021,"Much of the discussion around Pieces of a Woman seems to agree that it's a mediocre film held together solely by Kirby, and while I can't say enough about her performance, Mundruczo's direction deserves more respect than that. This is a film about emotions, how one deals with grief and how it affects their relationships. The opening is evocative, but I think the emotional notes are hit throughout the film. Kirby's delivery of lines as she tries to remain civil while overwhelmed with grief as well as her physical acting during labor are truly exceptional. The film had a patience to its rhythm and a muted color palette that add to the sadness and isolation Martha feels throughout the film. My real problem with the film is its frustratingly mediocre script, and how the personal narratives outside of Martha are simplistic and often nonsensical. Elizabeth, her mother, is the prime culprit. I do think Burstyn does a great job, and her monologue may well earn her a nomination that I wouldn't have a problem with. Her character's motivations, on the other hand, I cannot condone. Paying off the husband to leave was so abrupt and out of nowhere, and her stake in Martha's child and situation in general was poorly explained and rang hollow, despite some late scenes seeming to imply that it was at the heart of the film. I also didn't love Sean's character - we simply don't get enough of his relationship with Martha or himself in general during normal times to understand where this pretty wild shift comes from. Their cheating and breaking up is a massive deal, yet they never talk about it and we have no idea if this is surprising or if it seemed inevitable. Despite these flaws, I really enjoyed the movie and found Martha's emotional journey poignant and affecting. This is one that leaves me wondering what could have been - with a bit more refinement of the script, I think this could be the best film of the year. As it is, I certainly recommend it primarily for the tour de force performance from Kirby.",Pieces of a Woman
42,ridi-arahan,"""Time heals"" they say, but the right company and introspection makes it easier",8,20 January 2021,"What worked:
It's a well written and executed cinema. What stand out to me was the use of the camera as well as the beautiful screenplay. Every characters acted great and of course Vanessa was the center of the movie. The movie is sad, warm and heartbreaking at times but overall a beautiful movie with fine ending.
What did not work:
Maybe I would have liked it more if the ending was a bit more suggestive; it was metaphorical and emotional one. I don't deny the ending should have been anything else, maybe some scenes leading to the ending would have added more flavor to the beautiful ending the movie has.

44,sweidman-28016,The Emotionally Heavy Film of the Year,8,10 January 2021,"""My daughter came into this world, for the time that she did. And I can't bring her back.""Pieces of a Woman depicts the tragedy of a young mother's home birth. She begins a year-long odyssey of mourning that fractures relationships with loved ones in this deeply personal story of her learning to live alongside her loss. I'm going to start this by saying how difficult this film is. It's a tough watch right from the start. And for that reason, this won't be everyone's cup of tea (I should say straight up whiskey cause this just hits hard). By now it's pretty much universal that the first 30 minutes consists of the birth scene. Director Kornél Mundruczó gives us the whole experience right away. This is consistent throughout, though. We follow the characters literally for most scenes. The camera acts as a single take so we really see how the character in reference is thinking, feeling, and acting. And that works perfectly for the opening. I liked his direction throughout. It's consistent in tone and captures the emotion well making for a very emotional watch.More than anything, this is an acting showcase of a film. We're confined to only a few characters to keep it more small scaled and feel for each one. Vanessa Kirby is phenomenal. I'm glad that not every scene with her is just tear-soaked. She's dealing with grief her own way while everyone is telling her how she should feel. She showcases a large range of acting skills for a less predictable outcome of events/emotion. It's still a toss-up between her and Viola Davis for the Oscar it seems. But if it was me picking, I'd go for Kirby. Ellen Burstyn has some hefty monologues as well. We may not understand her motives all the time, but those few monologues reveal everything. Plus, she's just an amazing actress so she's at the top of her game the whole time. The supporting categories for the Oscars are too unpredictable at this point but all I know is she's getting nominated. Shia LaBeouf is good in here as well. He really doesn't get much credit anymore, but he is one of the better actors out right now. The top-notch acting is all from Kata Wéber's screenplay. The writing is really good and flows nicely. Nothing feels forced but all natural.The main issue comes from the second act. Some felt this more than me, but there's some time that feels pretty slow. No big events or much of anything happens that's key to the plot. I'm good with slow-paced films where this didn't affect me too much. At one point, I thought to myself, ""Is this going to be how the rest of the film is?"" But more stuff comes up to thicken the plot. I'm all for emotionally heavy films so I found Pieces of a Woman one of the year's most exceptional films. I just loved his everything captured the emotion. Even the score and cinematography furthers the effect. If you plan on watching this, I would suggest do it at an appropriate time where you can openly cry in a pillow or it might just feel meh to you. I would still highly recommend this.",Pieces of a Woman
45,TaylorYee94,Vanessa Kirby carries the movie all the way.,8,13 July 2021,"I sometimes become arrogant that I have watched enough movie and that I would know whether the work would be my type or not in first twenty minutes. I do not have favorite genre but I have movies that I hate, pretentious ones. The ones with no story or content, superficial development, and so-called abstract mastery. To make up for the weakness in the story, the director elongates and embellishes with 'artistic' cinematography and directing to attract critics' votes for awards.For the first thirty minutes, I thought 'Pieces of a Woman' would be one of those films. For some part, it is still similar because there is not much happening, the story is very simple, 'a woman who has stillbirth tries to cope with and overcome the personal tragedy', which is summarized in one phrase. However, the path of her emotional recovery and maturing is intricately illustrated by Kirby. Expression is described in inward or outward. She keeps it in the range of the surface, the middle of in and out. She does not overdramatize it, but I can feel the depth of her emotions with nonverbal expressions such as face and even fingers. I do not know about the director, but Vanessa Kirby's performance is a state of the art and takes this film to another level.",Pieces of a Woman

It's a brilliant portrait of a woman who for the majority of the film has things happening to her, people doing things they think she needs, agency well-meaningless removed. Her core flinty resolve is hinted at throughout, and when it's finally allowed out it's beautifully expressed in a final few minutes that could feel like lazy grandstanding but is instead delivered with all the restraint needed.

50,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,Crushed!!!,10,25 February 2021,"I am aghast. I had a feeling this would be legit, but wow. Devastatingly good. A masterful crusher. So well written, cast, and acted - I cannot. The opening sequence (30 minutes long) is, without a doubt, the most impressive piece of filmmaking to come out in 2020. This most certainly would have been in my Top 5 for 2020 if I had seen it before the end of the year.I had literally no idea who Vanessa Kirby was and she instantly entered the biggest of big leagues with this utterly powerful performance. The fact that she carries the film with such flying colors amidst the dynamic mix of such vets and long-time pros, whoa whoa whoa. Shia LeBeouf, regardless of how apparently problematic he's been IRL, has proven himself to be an immense on-screen force in the last decade, and this performance belongs in the upper tier of his capability (along with Lawless, American Honey, The Peanut Butter Falcon, and Nymphomaniac). Seeing the nearly 90-year-old Ellen Burstyn (Requiem For A Dream, The Exorcist) bring such a committed presence to the film has immense emotional value on it's own - and holy...can she still act. ICONIC. Other small roles add much welcomed color to the film as well, such as Sarah Snook (Shiv from Succession) and Benny Safdie (the first role I've seen him in outside of the Safdie Brothers' own films) - did not expect to see either of them, and they both sold their characters very well, fit right into the mix, and made me smile all the while. Whoever did the casting is a person of taste.There were only a couple moments that came off as a bit cheesy part way through the film, but by the end, my thoughts had been disproven as thematic wrap-arounds made those sequences beyond relevant.I'm sure it seems obvious but this is a devastatingly heavy film. It's hyper-real, very straightforward, and fully human and honest. You can feel while taking in this story and its details that it very much came from someone's unfortunate experience, and upon researching after the movie, I read that it is, in fact, the story of what the woman who wrote the movie and the director went through together. If you cry at movies, you will cry at this - it's almost guaranteed. I did...a lot.This movie is a masterpiece. And I can't process how anyone would give it any lower than 4 stars - the only thing that makes sense to me is that they simply can't handle this level of traumatic realism, or they only like movies with explosions. I can't wait to see more of Vanessa Kirby.",Pieces of a Woman
51,backup-50362,No surprises there,1,10 January 2021,"It has Shia LaBeouf and for some reason Iliza Shlesinger in it, so it was doomed from the start.If for some reason you want to pay for the ""privilege"" of feeling emotionally drained by a movie that tries REALLY hard to convey sadness and depression, you can watch this. It's all surface-level, shallow and garbage, but it may resonate with someone who's sensitive enough to fall victim to its lazy ""oh so emotional"" writing, even despite the terrible actors involved.But most people best avoid this, there's nothing to it. Surely you've seen movies that hide their inadequacies by relaying on excessive violence, sex, or in this case - emotional manipulation before. This is a trick as old as ever, making you tear up in order to convince you that what you're watching is beautiful and meaningful. But it's not, just cheap emotional manipulation.",Pieces of a Woman
52,coreyjdenford,Just about tears you to pieces,6,7 January 2021,"Child birth is said to be the most painful thing to endure, but it is also said that once the pain is done, there's a sudden euphoria not because the pain is over but when a mother sees and holds her baby that she has been carrying for nine months it's almost as if nothing can compare that kind of feeling. Pieces of a Woman shows that in its glorious opening 30 minute long take of an excruciating home birth, when Martha (a brilliant Vanessa Kirby) goes through that type of pain and then happiness, but sadly pain again as her baby sadly perishes. Just a fair warning, this film will break you apart as Martha perpetually isolates herself with constant pain and emotion and Kirby's performance is brilliant through it all. But sadly after the opening act it's almost as if the film is left running on fumes, it runs out of energy, granted the performances are great through it all but there's a lot of stuff to get through and it's almost as if producer Martin Scorsese ran out of steam half way through. The direction is good, the writing is good and the performances are outstanding but that's all that Pieces of a Woman has on show. It's provocative enough to keep you engaged, to elicit such a strong subject as child loss and the conversations after the final credits will certainly be enough to enrage a controversial if not an undermining tone, but the film does that on its own. If this was to be a piece to show what happens during child birth, the motionless latter half should be left out, only keep the opening. As ultimately at the film's climax we're left with A+ acting and nothing else. 3/5. It's good for a one time watch.",Pieces of a Woman

Director: Kornel Mundruczo
Starring: Vanessa Kirby, Shia Labeouf, Ellen Burstyn, Illiza Shlesinger, Sarah Snook, Molly Parker etc.Overall rating 79/100Pieces of a woman is based on a couple who have a home birth that goes horribly wrong and focuses on the slow breakdown of their relationship as the aftermath of losing a baby takes a toll on both of their mental health. Pieces of a woman was a phenomenally acted movie with some truly powerful moments However, it did have its flaws with a second half that just couldn't match the first so let's get started.First of all, the movie had fantastic character background and development, as well as fantastic performances and chemistry between actors. The movie did a fantastic job at giving background to both the lead characters, I felt like I understood both of the characters and what kind of people they were before actually seeing them together as a couple which was great. I also thought the character development of the movie was truly something special. The way the characters emotions developed as the scenes went on was something phenomenal every emotion was on show to humour, joy, fear panic and heartbreak all In such a short space of time and to see the characters mental health slowly deteriorate as the movie progressed was powerfully done. I also have to applaud the performances in this movie. Shia Labeouf was fantastic and showed a lot of depth and emotion to his performance, but the true star of the movie had to be Vanessa Kirby. Wow what a performance and truly Oscar worthy, she had so much depth and nuance to her performance, she was charming and she authentically displayed the horrors of losing a child and the effect it can have on someone in such a heartbreakingly beautiful way it was fantastic. And her on screen chemistry with Shia as well as her mother in the movie Ellen Burstyn was off the charts.My next few positives would be realistic portrayal of birth, the powerful scenes within the movie. The fantastic script as well as the great cinematography. Wow the movies homebirth scene was truly powerful, it lasted 30 minutes but it was truly powerful cinema, this scene was so realistic and even educational in the process of labour and was difficult to watch in places, but the script, performances and the realism with it was amazing. The script was absolutely fantastic, it was powerful, moving and there was multiple moving monologues from the characters that gave them so much depth it was incredible, it really made you stop and think and often gave me chills in some scenes. I also thought the cinematography was beautiful as well, the simplistic yet stunning set locations were great, I also really liked the visual metaphors linked to the script in previous parts of the movie with links to Apples and multiple other things.However, my few negatives for the movie sadly bought it down slightly where it just couldn't live up to the first half. The second half of the movie in general was very messy, it had pacing issues, and inconsistent character decisions. The second half of the movie for me was very inconsistent with its pacing, there was scenes that really dragged and didn't feel needed, or scenes that felt really rushed and it was very clunky and awkward to watch in places. There was also a lot of inconsistent character decisions. This made it really difficult who to actually support in the second half, one character made a really good point and then the next they were being horrible and you didn't like them and it was just a constant back and forth of character decisions that didn't really make sense for those particular characters half the time. And Shia Labeouf leaving half way through didn't make sense in terms of satisfying character development for his character or his relationship with Vanessa Kirby. Finally the second half in general was just very messy. There was way too many plot points that didn't really get any depth or development to them making what was a powerfully done first half lose its impact slightly.However, my next few positives would be the character depth and emotional weight, the character conflict and building of tension and finally, the powerful ending. I thought the character depth for Vanessa Kirby's character was truly amazing, how she reacted with other little kids and the depth to what she was feeling in different situations was insane, she had so many layers to her recovery from depression it was truly something special to watch, because of this, the movie had a lot of emotional weight. The movie was tough to watch, the way the characters were written were so raw and authentic you connected with and felt every emotion from them as their mental health got worse and worse, and some of the dialogue actually got me emotional as well with fantastic delivery. I also thought the character conflict and building of tension was fantastic, I thought the slow building of tension between Shia and Vanessa was absolutely fantastic, It was done in such a subtle but powerful way and the conflict felt authentic and earned due to the situation they were both in. I also thought the ending was powerful, luckily the movie redeemed itself slightly at the end, the whole court scene was fantastic and one of the best monologues of the whole movie and was a satisfying end to the movie and for Vanessa Kirby's character.Overall, Pieces of a woman is a powerful movie with fantastic performances, a heartbreakingly realistic and authentic portrayal of the emotional impact of losing a baby and some really incredible character moments with the script, but the movies second half fails to capture the power or how fantastic the first half was, and the movie never truly recovered from it, but it still has powerful messages and a script/performance from Vanessa Kirby I would recommend everyone see.",Pieces of a Woman

57,noahgibbobaker,Beautiful sorrow.,8,22 January 2021,"I was really excited about this and it exceed my expectations. There is a lot of talk about this being oscar bait trash but I don't really get that. It's a really well presented, beautifully shot, emotional film.Cinematography by Benjamin Loeb.Grief is portrayed respectfully and realistically for the most part, Vanessa Kirby gives one of the best performances of the year without a doubt and Shia Lebeouf surprised me a lot. I haven't liked him since the ""just do it"" video and he was great in this. Benny Safdie is in this, he's great, and Ellen Burstyn gives her best performance since requiem for a dream.
I respect Kirby and Lebeouf for putting themselves in such a vulnerable position.There are some issues I have despite loving most of what this movie has to offer. It was fairly predictable throughout which gave a few scenes a lot less impact than they would have had otherwise. There's a couple moments where the characters actions are outside the realm of believability and nearing the end a few scenes are dragged out for way too long.You've probably heard but long takes are very prominent and are very impressive. They're extremely well choreographed and give all the actors a chance to shine.As I mentioned, pieces of a woman is an emotional experience, there was one scene in particular I want to mention because it kind of moved me. The scene with Martha in the bathroom cubicle. It's short but gives all the information we need to know how hard the last few weeks have been for her and how they have emotionally and psychically affected her.Overall pieces of a woman is one of the best films of 2020 that shows how vital presentation is. There are issues with this film that I might not be so forgiving of in a movie with worse presentation.",Pieces of a Woman
58,TheCorniestLemur,I need to pick up the pieces of my mind,9,25 July 2021,"Jesus this hits hard.It hits hard because of its uncompromising subject matter, it hits hard because of its performances, which are nothing short of perfect (never thought I'd be saying this, but Frances McDormand did not deserve that Oscar, not when up against a lead performance like this), and it hits hard because of its cinematography, which is creative and technically stunning.I haven't seen any of the films that Shia ""I'm never giving you this cube"" LaBeouf has supposedly been good in after Transformers, so to see his acting in this is...I don't think ""whiplash"" can possibly describe the feeling I got witnessing how amazing he is in this. And Vanessa Kirby...well damn, I hadn't seen her in anything before this, and frankly, I think she should just be hired for a role just by saying ""hello, I played the main role in this film"". She's that damn good. Ellen Burstyn was surely born to play this role, because even for how limited a time she's on screen, she leaves one hell of an impact.I'll stop mentioning individual performances here, but rest assured, if someone is in this movie, they are a fantastic actor and should be getting more roles.The writing in this film is so good that it makes me worry about the writer and director possibly even more than Inside did, seeing as it was written by a woman who actually lost her child and directed by the father of said child. Virtually everyone in this film is unlikeable at one point or another (some more than others however), but my god do you just...get it. You get exactly why they've become like this, even though entire chunks of their lives are left out in places, and you can't help but feel sympathetic to them even in their respective ""entry for the biggest jackass competition"" scenes.The soundtrack is great too, if maybe a little bit overbearing at points, and the cinematography...oh my lord the cinematography. It's in fact so good, it's my only real complaint with the film. Mild spoilers here I guess, there's a very long take scene towards the beginning of the film. When I say very long, I mean easily over 20 minutes long, and although I can't imagine there wasn't some trickery involved, it's still one hell of an accomplishment and elevates the scene to one of my favourite scenes of last year territory.It's so good, the reason it's a mild problem is that the rest of the film feels like it doesn't live up to it, and although the rest of the film is still brilliant, I couldn't help but think it did peak in those 20 minutes.In short, the pieces of this woman are absolutely shattered, and then come back together so beautifully that for this to only get a single Oscar nomination was criminal. I just hope it wasn't The Academy trying to continue their already lost fight against Netflix films not being ""real films"", because Netflix is continuing to be equal to, if not better in some years, than actual cinemas, and if you're going to tell me this isn't a ""real film"" because you can watch it at any time you want, you can take a giant space hopper right in the face.",Pieces of a Woman
59,ivanmessimilos,Not easy to watch but I liked it,8,23 April 2021,"An extremely difficult film to watch especially the scenes at the beginning of the film that lasted a long time without a cut. Time heals all wounds. A well-known saying and it seems to me that this is the main motive in this film. I find that every family has some sad and difficult event that happened to them, but not every individual copes with it in the same way. That's exactly what the movie is about. Yet I didn't like the supporting characters and some parts in the second half of the film. They don't make sense to me and don't seem like complete wholes to me. The lead roles did a great acting job. The rating goes more because of the apples and the bridge, I really liked that motif and the connection to the film.",Pieces of a Woman
60,danybur,A failed tale of loss and grief.,5,13 January 2021,"This time, instead of starting with a plot review, I must ask myself, what did director Kornél Mundruczó and his wife, screenwriter Kata Weber, set out to tell me with this film?One could answer: tell us a story about the effects of loss in sharpening the contrasts of a marriage, about denial as a defense mechanism, about mourning as a command or imposition, about the ethics of reparation, about class differences on a couple, on the new obstetric fashions, on manipulative mothers, on women and their pregnant bodies, on the Judeo-Christian guilt ... all as a correlate of a (too) long and effective opening scene (which will generate rivers of admiration in part of the public) filmed in sequence shot and that if it aspires to hit the viewer, it will cause their interest in the rest of the story to wane somewhat in those who are affected by its (supposed) harshness.The problem with this film is that it fails to adequately translate all these topics and conflicts (if it is all of them) in dramatic terms through characters and a story that evolve and move and whose elements are assembled and complemented. Furthermore, the fragmentary structure of the story, which uses ellipsis in a systematic way, does not contribute to the viewer's connection either; hence, in part, the name ""Fragments."" Even the performances were not outstanding to me.Personally, then, I have found it impossible to empathize with her characters, except for a few moments with the protagonist (Vanessa Kirby) and to detest her partner a bit (the overactive Shia LaBoeuf)",Pieces of a Woman

I don't think I've ever seen her before and I was mighty impressed going from warm and loving and kind to ice cold. The role is all over the emotional map and she does them all superbly in this year of some outstanding female performances. I've read complaints about the second half of this film, but I have none, but one. I think this film is strong and honest with interesting characters and situations and many are not easy or pleasant.

For a moment I felt happy too but then I remembered the synopsis and my heart shrank as it did for the film's characters.Before watching, you have to know what you are getting yourself into and you have to be in the right mood for such a film. Pieces of a Woman is a slow drama that depicts loss, heartbreak and the different ways in which people cope with it. Here, the death of child doesn't merely crush people's lives but it seemingly disintegrates them.Naturally, acting plays a huge part in depicting the emotions and the actors bring their talent to the table. Vanessa Kirby, Shia LaBeouf and Ellen Burstyn are each given space to show how they deal with grief whether it is through sadness, anger or fortitude. It is a powerful film with a quiet demeanour yet nuanced cinematography, script and music.

She displays such beautiful depth of acting dimensions to her character. The performance is the best I have seen in a long time. Ellen Burysten as her mother is very good as well trying to help her daughter deal with her grief. She has a very emotional show stopper scene that is worthy of a best supporting actress nomination. Shia Labeouf is also very effective as Sean, Martha's husband who is also struggling to deal with his grief as well.

66,Come-and-Review,Heart-jerker like a Bergman film,9,5 September 2020,"I've seen several comparisons of Mundruczó's style to that of Cassavettes, but when the credits arrived, Bergman came to my mind: largely discoursive, disfunctional family relationships, and naturalistic dialogue despite the presence of a structured screenplay.The english language debut of the hungarian director is built around eight different days, each distant about a month from the other, as it depicts the way the life of the titular woman changes after a tragic miscarriage. Most of the scenes use very well made one-shot sequences (particularly successful is one that happens very early in the movie, perhaps one of the best single takes I've seen in years, but it dangerously overshadowed the rest of the filmAs I see it, a film is well writtwn when all its structural elements check out, and this is the case here: every piece of dialogue is deeply connected to the main story yet the overall effect of naturalism is unaffected.Pieces of a Woman is a character-driven story, and thus the performances of the titular actors much be noted: not only the subtly emotional Vanessa Kirby but Ellen Burstyn's role as the protagonist'a mother, as well as Shia Labeouf's painful take on the partner's role.Scorsese was totally right: this movie is surprising, yet in an unexpected, subtle way.

But in my first year reviewing on Letterboxd, movies like this appear so consistently in the ""Popular with Friends"" feed I find myself drawn to them.And after forcing my self to watch PIeces of a Woman knowing I'd struggle, I think I'm going with my gut next time around.I don't really have much to add to what's been said before. The birth scene is heart wrenching. The acting is phenomenal. Shia Lebouf's performance was so excellent I kept wanting to slap myself in the face reminding myself that he's a complete asshole.But the bulk of the movie after the first act is just painful to sit through. Not because of the depressing subject matter. Nothing really gels.Overall it felt like a jigsaw puzzle that was half completed.",Pieces of a Woman
68,Golden_Hope,Wonderful Acting,6,7 January 2021,"People are saying that this movie is fantastic for the first half and then kinda looses steam. I kinda of agree but I think that it is much more up and down than that. The opening is really good but is a little manic at time. This bothered me a little bit but then I got the feeling that maybe it was on purpose to sort of drag us into the feelings of the characters at that moment.I do agree that this film does start to sag after the opening but it does have more peaks especially the scenes between Vanessa Kirby and Ellen Burstyn. The scenes in the later parts of the movie between them characters were so good to watch. It was just such a showcase of great acting.One small thing I found Shia's character to just be unlikable but that may be the fault of Shia I don't know. He was just so boring and flat and terrible.The film does look good and I think some of the small production design choices were really well thought out and I enjoyed the other little techniques that the film makers used to make it a little bit more Interesting.The score was just a tiny, tiny little bit off for me. It was so close for me but when I was enjoying it there would be a turn and I would be like oh no that wasn't right.The issues above are all pretty minor as I have one major one and that is the dialogue. It was so soggy. It was just like sluggish. Some of it was better than other parts but the clunkers were really just bad. There was a lot of ""hi how are you"" ""I am good"" ""oh good me too"" ""that's good"" ""yeah that is good"".I think you could watch it for the acting and especially the first half and parts in the latter half.",Pieces of a Woman
69,michael-561-692892,Nothing but anxiety,6,8 January 2021,I gained nothing from this film other than anxiety and grief of the characters. I guess I owe that to the fact that both actors are really good at their craft.This story is sad but why make a feature film on this? To show the pain of losing a child after the pain of a birth? It's so raw at times that it leaves no space for imagination. You witness the birth. You witness the loss. You witness the two separate directions either character travel. Are humans really this screwed up? If they are I really didn't need to see it.,Pieces of a Woman
70,pontus-randen,Fantastic acting with an important message,7,9 January 2021,"The actors are all very good and does a great job. At the end of the movie there is one important message in this day and age: ""Why should I transfer my pain to someone else?"".What this means is that people should stop blaming everybody else for their own misfortunes. Today very many people are spreading blame like a lawnmower spreads grass. Quite often the blame is spread upon people who lived several hundred years ago, under totally different cultural and ethical circumstances. What the movie tries to say is:Man up and take control of your own life, instead of blaming someone else.",Pieces of a Woman
71,dale-51649,"Unrealistic , maudlin, melodramatic junk",2,10 January 2021,"The story is about a lady who has a home brith gone wrong. She has a kind of cold personality, and is generally rude and bossy. Her husband is kind of a neanderthal type, with a speech pattern that sounds kind of dumb, although he has a skilled, difficult job as a bridge builder. Maybe the writers thought that arch welders and designers of suspension bridges are stupid because they are strong and work with their hands ?
To make matters worse, he acts like a man, but the content of is dialogue is like a woman ""I miss her "" crackles through his sobs..... I know men can of course miss a child that died at birth and be depressed , but his display just didn't seem authentic, a more stoic display would have fit his personality better.
The wife had reason to be sad, but that doesn't excuse talking to most other human beings as though they are dirt. In another scene they diss a pathologist describing objective medical findings and then chewing him out for not being able to say what caused the death. He should have told them ""if you listened to us doctors, you would have had her in the hospital and you would be holding her right now "". The recent disrespect for people in the medical community from movie writers is a disturbing trend I see all the time. Maybe ever rich kid wanting to work in movies instead of doing something as difficult as medicine has them insecure. .
Another problem is , they have the most un hot sex scenes imaginable. They show bickering or depressed people awkwardly getting it on, sort of . I agree w the husband ""naw, fu*&k it, I don't wanna do it now"",.....",Pieces of a Woman

So do American men.This is a typical Hollywood-attack-film on home births, on women that choose to not to submit to government doctors, and on women who care about mothers and babies.It should be called, Pieces of Communist American couples, because of what it promotes, not because of its plot.
It promotes women and men, acting like petulant, children, and self destructing because of a birth.It's worse how they portray the man, which is expected from Hollywood, but it's unusual in a film where they are also raking women over the coals. I'm also surprised by the lack of gratuitous black characters.In the end, I think the movie is designed to portray white men, woman, and babies as a scourge of humanity, so that fits.It does have some moments of actual humanity, but they are fleeting.Production quality is good.",Pieces of a Woman
73,Oktay_Tuna,Vanessa Kirby's Performance Is Mature and Heart-Breaking,6,8 January 2021,"What an extraordinary performance from Vanessa Kirby. It is clear to see that she has mastered the character of Martha. She knows when to be subtle and also when to shine. From the tone of her voice to how her eyes move, it is superb. The rest of the cast is also great , but this is Vanessa's film and she will definitely get nominated for an Oscar if not win. I feel like the big issue with the film is in particular the screenplay. The director did his job very well, especially the first 30 minutes show that he cared about filming the movie in the best way. The writing though was at best mediocre. This is a simple story to write but very difficult to present it in a film. I don't know how they messed this up but what I watched was clearly the opposite. The director and the actors were all fabulous but the screenplay just didn't know where to go. It just lingers, almost all the time. If it wasn't for Vanessa's acting, these lingers would have become unbearable. The way the story progresses is sloppy, it goes somewhere with a character then just does something completely different with another one. I didn't like Sean's storyline in the film. It started good but then there were some choices which were not only bad but also very unnecessary to plot(Not getting into any spoilers) Some characters were also very one dimensional(not including the mother of Martha of course) but they were in front of the screen for a long period of time. I feel like this film and Judy(2019) are very similar, in both of them the lead actress gave their best performances but the story was just mediocre and sloppy. Don't get me wrong, the story can be simple and should be simple but the storylines in the 2nd and 3rd act(other than Vanessa's which was good and carried by Vanessa's performance) were just unnecessary and hurt the main plot. The movie could have been one of the best movies of the year if the screenplay didn't mix it up. Still, a must check for the first 30 minutes and Vanessa Kirby's performance.",Pieces of a Woman

Although slow-paced and with some small lacunae, Pieces of a Woman sheds light not only on dramas similar to the story, but of every mother who finds herself in ""pieces"" of herself expressed with childbirth and its consequences, concepts that, in fact, only mothers can understand. A film with an excellent direction by Kornél Mundruczó that searches for details and expressions, especially the latter in his characters and in their non-verbal language, therefore complete with every language, all also emphasized by the music of the timeless Howard Shore, but all thanks to the beautiful writing by Kata Wéber. Thick cast, which meets two eras, two schools, two ways of thinking and acting, but which explodes under a single ""hut""; Shia LaBeouf gives one of her most solid performances ever, Ellen Burstyn who enchants and charms, but the star of the film is a Vanessa Kirby in the toughest role of her career (so far), which makes her a real actress , a very solid interpretation, poignant, strong, exciting and at the same time that takes to the heart, pain embodied woman, the embodied meaning of a woman, the word mother made woman, a sort of virgin Mary of the contemporary cinema.

75,joshbarton15,Vanessa Kirby is simply fantastic.,8,2 January 2021,"With awards season just about to kick into gear, the start of a new year means those film that have done the rounds at various festivals for the past number of months are released in rather quick succession. Pieces of a Woman is a film Netflix hope will bring them home some awards, particularly in the acting categories, and it's certainly a film that doesn't stray away from telling a difficult story.When a young mother's (Vanessa Kirby) home birth ends in unfathomable tragedy, she begins a year-long odyssey of mourning that fractures relationships with loved ones in this deeply personal story of a woman learning to live alongside her loss.There's no real way to discuss Kornél Mundruczó's Pieces of a Woman without first discussing the film's opening sequence. It's such a tragic and traumatic start to the film that, by the time the title card appears on screen after half-an-hour, I felt like I needed to pause the film to have a breather and compose myself. Mundruczó brings it to life with such realism and Benjamin Loeb's cinematography is to be lauded here because the long take only builds the suspense to unbearable levels at times while the close-ups of Vanessa Kirby's Martha throughout the sequence really make you feel her panic building.What follows may struggle to live up to the standard of the film's opening but it does manage to tell a story about a woman learning to live alongside her loss in a respectful and touching manner. Kata Wéber's sreenplay features some rather powerful moments that include fractured families and poignant moments of refelction.At the forefront of Pieces of a Woman is a fantastic lead performance from Vanesa Kirby. It's one that has rightly put her in the race for all the Best Actress awards out there and I'm sure a lot of it will be down to her performance in the film's opening however, there's more to her performance than that. It's a cold portrayal of a woman going through an unimaginable loss that impacts the lives of others surrounding her and Kirby is just brilliant, particularly during a monologue towards the film's closing moments.This is undoubtedly Kirby's film but there is also some stellar support from the likes of Shia LaBeouf and Ellen Burstyn, the latter certainly adding a touch of melodrama to proceedings. Expect to see her name a lot this awards season as a result.Pieces of a Woman is most definitely a film that doesn't look to hide away from a difficult subject matter and it's something that the film has to be applauded for. Vanessa Kirby's performance is the real star here though and one that will spoken about for years to come.",Pieces of a Woman
76,i_odin,A well acted movie but with flaws,6,29 April 2021,"Pieces of a Woman is a film.It is a tale of a woman who is sad and going through a tough phase because of losing her child and growing distant from her partner.This is literally the whole film, and everything else feels like just fillers. In terms of screenplay, the establishment of the plot is powerful and promising. But then the film looses it's plot. It is a film dwelling on grieve but after a point the film starts seeming repetitive. There are moments when there is literally nothing happening on scene. Although that will be a stylistic choice but when you have a poor script, those bland moments sure starts itching.In terms of performance both Kirby and LaBeouf are exceptionally good. And that's why. It seems unfair to not give them a better script to work upon.Overall a okay movie but because of strong performances, worth watching.",Pieces of a Woman
77,isaacsundaralingam,Greif and what it does,7,30 March 2021,"A common complaint I see about this movie is that it wasn't consistent in its pacing. That the second half was somewhat draggy. And to a certain extent, yea, I felt that too. But I don't think it really matters when what's being discussed here is the effect the tragedy of losing a child can have on a mother and the people around her.I think Vanessa Kirby's performance was outstanding. From joy to excitement to grief, I think she demonstrated to us what she is capable of in front of the camera. And I wish her more success in the future. Not only her, even Shia, who unlike many, I actually enjoy as an artiste, did a really good job showcasing frustration from the father's perspective. The acting department in this movie overall, did a solid job.My issue with the movie is the entire lawsuit aspect it focuses on for a large chunk of the movie. It was this issue where maybe it could be very real, but once behind a screen, we the audience see the moralities dictating the entire flow from the beginning itself, and so by the time it nears the climax, almost know for sure how it's bound to end. Maybe that doesn't really matter to most people, but I found it to be somewhat disappointing.Other than that, I don't really have any complaints.

It is genius, unfortunately it doesn't stay that way.This movie goes up and down. It is extraordinary when the characters actually interact. Whenever Shia and Kirby act together either in a positive way in the beginning or in sorrow and anger later it is magic. Their chemistry is amazing. And even though Shia has now proven again and again that he is a great actor this is Vanessa Kirby's movie. If that isn't an Oscar nomination I don't know what is.The movie is less great when actors don't interact. When the camera just follows them doing stuff. It is important to let a movie breath but this is too much and so the pacing is off which makes it dragging especially in the third act. Cut 20 minutes and everything would fall into place.

80,kevvportela,Intimate and emotional. Vanessa gives one of the best performances of the year,9,3 April 2021,"A devastating, detailed and not very explosive drama, but that is what makes this piece directed by Kornél Mundruczó special and intimate.This film shows the experience of Martha (Vanessa Kirby) and Sean (Shia LaBeouf) from the birth of their daughter to their loss. It is a very intimate story and the striking thing is that it does not emphasize the death or the couple after this but on the daily life after the duel, I do not know if I explain myself but all of Martha's environment wants and forces her to express herself before what happened when she did not feel necessary at the moment because she did not assimilate all her traumatic experience.On the one hand, in a headline I read that this story is not about a duel but about the violation of the privacy of the same by the nucleus towards the victim and I don't think there is a better way to describe it.The film proposes certain distractions such as infidelities that could have been exploited but it was not the idea, and this made it have a focused and clear path.Regarding performances, they are all a 10. Vanessa manages to convey EVERYTHING with her look, tone and posture, a super delicate, fragile and strong performance at the same time, her first Oscar nomination and more than deserved, even with a potential to win . Shia plays a good role in this man who falls apart from his addictions and does not understand his wife. On the part of the secondary performances, Ellen Burstyn makes a complete character and power in the evolution of the main character, I am sorry that she was ignored in this awards season. I also want to highlight the parts of Molly Parker, which appears very little but in the strongest scenes where her presence is pristine and well marked.Closing this review, it is a beautiful film to watch but that sensitizes the viewer a lot from the realistic and everyday way it is seen.",Pieces of a Woman

Vanessa embodied the mental hell an event like that can put on someone, she really immersed herself into this.

84,madanmarwah,"A case of home birth gone wrong, midwife blamed",7,21 March 2021,"This film about a home birth gone wrong where the baby dies soon after birth, can best be described in three parts. The first part, around 30 minutes focuses on extended scenes of the agony of a woman in labour ( Vanessa Kirby) , the longish middle part of the film deals with the grief of the woman as she goes through dysfunctional relationships with her husband ( Shia LaBeouf) , mother ( Ellen Burstyn ) and relatives while the last part consists of courtroom scenes. Supposedly based on a true story ( as per Google), the film has scenes of pathos and tragedy.
What keeps the viewers riveted are the excellent performances of Vanessa and Ellen as the the daughter and mother respectively. Vanessa is awesome as the broken grieving mother and gets into the skin of the character as she withdraws deeply to grieve in silence . Her scenes of aloofness in the family group are well done. She might just walk away with an award in April 21. Ditto for Ellen who has acted superbly as the worried mother and hers is also an award winning performance. Worth mentioning is the scene of her despair as she recounts her birth and survival years back.
Director Kornél Mundruczó has done an excellent job, though I wonder if extended scenes of labor were required to be shown in such detail. ( The sound track is full of her wailing as she suffers pangs of labor). The ending scenes are heart warming.",Pieces of a Woman

It was pretty apparent from the start the mid wife didn't really deserve the vitriol she received and you knew she would be resolved by the end, so there wasn't much in the way of dramatic tension regarding that section. The fallout amongst the characters and the effect this event had on them was the strongest aspect and props on some truly great performances, across the board.

The very first thing that tries to catch our attention is the acting of Vanessa Kirby as well as Shia LaBeouf's acting. From start to end their acting tries to grasp us throughout the whole film but that's not enough to uplift a whole movie. The direction and screenplay is good as it is for this film but at some point we expect it to be slightly better. The movie has some skippable moments because it's not a movie that everyone will watch and enjoy for 2 hour straight. Other than that there are some moments where the film makes us curious for what's gonna happen next and we get blended with it totally. Overall it's a movie you can check out and add it on your weekend list. If not for the whole movie then just for the acting.,Pieces of a Woman

Unfortunately after that first half the movie loses its suspense and becomes a regular family drama, filled with some slow pace boring at times scenes, and while Vanessa keeps the performance consistency, Shia's character is simply an unlikable one and a strange match for Vanessa's character, in fact their relationship is strange from the start.This is just my humble opinion but if instead of a dysfunctional couple drama they would opt for a regular couple facing a horrible tragedy and how they would deal with it, maybe would've made things more interesting - still Oscar worthy performance by Vanessa.",Pieces of a Woman

Pieces of a Woman is not a good film.Maybe it's only me but why make Sean use an obsolete 35 mm camera when he has just fetched his smartphone to call 911? Who takes pictures with 35 mm these days when digital is so much more convenient? Does living in an early 20th century house make you that nostalgic? Where do you find anyone to develop 35 mm these days, never mind black and white film. Amazing.Technical problems aside, I was also put off by Vanessa Kirby's overblown emotions later in the film.

96,severindringel,A movie about grief and fait - driven by its stellar performances,8,8 January 2021,"How does it feel to lose someone you knew only briefly, but loved more than anyone ever before? How does such a blow of fate affect my fellow human beings and interpersonal relationships? Am I still capable of making the right decisions? Kornél Mundruczó tries to answer these questions in his drama Pieces of a Woman. Carried by spectacular performances and a heartbreaking script, he achieves this to a large extent.Vanessa Kirby is known to most as Princess Margaret from The Crown. Here she embodies Martha, a heavily pregnant young woman approaching to become a mother for the first time. In a 23 minute opening scene, she gets to deal with every kind of emotion. Physical pain, happiness, despair, love - and finally pure heartbreak. She carries the latter emotion in the aftermath until the very end, but this does not make her character one-dimensional. Through Kirby's terrific acting, one always suffers with her, even if her decisions are not the most comprehensible. Shia LaBeouf, as her partner Sean, is a shambles who chooses very different methods of combating grief than Martha. This makes the chemistry between the two often fascinating, but equally frustrating. Hollywood icon Ellen Burstyn is out for revenge throughout the entire film as Martha's mother, making her relationship with her daughter very toxic and strained. She dominates the screen in every one of her scenes and dialogues.Pieces of a Woman is a drama that is hard to beat in terms of realism and it gets to you. One can hardly avoid trying to put oneself in the shoes of the characters during the two-hours. This can be too much for many. A very successful feature of the film is how it uses its symbols. Linked to the title, different parts of the protagonist's body are shown in almost every new scene. It also follows the construction of a new bridge over the year, which also mirrors the plot of the film to some extent. Unfortunately, after the terrific one-take opening scene, the film often gets lost in all its misery, which makes it annoying to watch at times. However, its human-centred writing, beautiful natural shots and brilliant acting make Pieces of a Woman a very accomplished film overall - although it's also too dependent on its stellar performances.",Pieces of a Woman

103,Bek204,"""Who cares about what they think? This is about me""",8,8 January 2021,"When a young mother's home birth ends in unfathomable tragedy, she begins a year-long odyssey of mourning that fractures relationships with loved ones in this deeply personal story of a woman learning to live alongside her loss. (Via IMDb)Pieces Of a Woman is an intense ride full of grief, sadness, and an emotional/heartbreaking story.The film has many elements that were being used very well that made the film and its story a unique one. The script is very well written and every little detail is there for a reason. The film's first 30 minutes are unbelievable, it's very intense and will make you want to continue watching the film. The first 30 minutes are made to look like a long take but it's actually just a cinematic trick. And not just the first 30 minutes but also throughout the film there are scenes that were made to look like a long take which was very well done because it gave the film a unique taste and they were also perfect because it fits those scenes that were dramatic and emotional.In addition, The cinematography is beyond beautiful. The film has that camera movement that is steady but moves around in a specific movement way to make the scenes more stressful and dramatic. Colors are also great, they match with that dark/depressing/sad/dramatic grief energy that the film has in which you can feel it coming out of your TV screen sometimes.The hair & make-up, custom designs, set design, and the music were all perfect and matching with the theme and environment of the film.Shia LaBeouf is absolutely great as always. But, Vanessa Kirby is the one who stole the spotlight, she was able to portrait that role perfectly. Her whole facial expressions were explaining what she s going through and how she feels inside of her, THE GRIEF. Every dialogue that Ellen Burstyn did was great but her deep/genuine acting performance made the scene ten times better.Loved how some scenes are dialogue-free in which they focus more on the cinematography, set design, and the feeling of grief and to absorb the dramatic story that the film discusses.The background noises were great as they were building more emotions into the scene like the sound of a heartbeat in the background of a dialogue.I didn't like the fact that throughout the film, it jumps suddenly several times to a month later which basically was confusing because we get to figure out how the characters ended up being there by ourselves without any explanations which was a little bit confusing. I knew what was going on but I just couldn't figure out how they ended up being there.To sum up, some will call Pieces of a Woman a ""cold and boring film"" which I totally get but personally, I enjoyed every single scene. The film is filled with a dramatic and deep story and I ""highly recommend it"".My rating is 8/10",Pieces of a Woman
104,gliderguy,This movie felt like it was 9 months long,2,29 April 2021,"This is the WORST movie I have seen in some time - and it isn't even close. The highpoint, if you want to call it that, was a still birth. And it goes downhill from there. Even the glowing reviews admit that 3/4 of the movie is S L O W. Let me put it another way: skip the rest of the movie, nothing happens.",Pieces of a Woman
105,theshanecarr,A bloodless fight,6,20 January 2021,"I can get carried away in films, and as this film opened, and I saw Shia LaBoeuf as a blue-collar guy being gruff but excellent at his job before heading home to his very pregnant wife, I thought; ""Okay, clunky exposition, but this film is getting in the ring with this couple, and I am here for it.""I had no idea what was about to happen, but I was ready to go the distance.
Then I realised I was about ten minutes into a single take scene. Damn! Now I was admiring the film-making; the camera snaking around the couple, and the house, catching a moment here, and an expression there was really throwing me into the action - and what action! A woman goes into labour and delivers a baby with all the attendant drama and anxiety and wonder that that brings, and it's done in a single near-30 minute take?!
Wow.
This is going to be amazing!But then....
Cold. And knocked out cold. Just cold. There was no let-up in the scenes that followed, just grim observation of a relationship breaking down, both partners knowing it, but being unable to do anything about it.It was well acted. It was well observed. But it all felt a little too considered. A little too pent up. A little too orchestrated. Like someone was afraid to let it get messy.
I wanted the characters to be trying to fix things but from the moment the delivery was done, they seemed to have given up on each other. ""Fight!"", I wanted to yell at them. And they shouted alright but they never fought for anything, they never tried to save anything.
And when it was over, I was simply unmoved. If they don't care, why should I?The film deals with difficult subject matter. I have not been in this couple's particular situation, but I have been in tough circumstances, and even there I found moments in which I could laugh, moments in which I could try to keep going, even if I fell down. This movie is just people falling down and refusing to get up, and it didn't help me see them any clearer.There are other bizarre choices. There is a courtroom sub-plot that is entirely tacked on. There could be a great film that, after the first 30 minutes, concerns itself entirely with the court case. Or there could be a great film that, after the first 30 minutes, focuses entirely on life afterwards. This film wanted to have it both ways and it did a disservice to both strands.Bizarre too that, having given more or less equal concern to both parents, the film loses interest in LaBoeuf's character towards the end. I can't understand why. His arc simply stopped after so much had been invested in him.Vanessa Kirby (who made an impression going toe-to-toe with Tom Cruise in Mission:Impossible - Fallout) deserves huge credit for the way she holds the screen. She is clearly an incredible talents and I look forward to seeing her in much more.Kornél Mundruczó's direction is technically brilliant, and his trust in his actors to deliver the goods pays off.It is the screenplay by Kata Wéber that lets them down - choosing to wallow in the pain everyone is feeling rather than understanding that there is always light, not just at the end, but even amidst the fight.",Pieces of a Woman
106,jleeharris-36991,Not good at all,3,7 January 2021,"Just ok and very sad subject matter. The relationship between the characters is dysfunctional and overly dramatic. Its not realistic that her partner sleeps with the prosecuting attorney at the first meeting. The attorney would know that would ruin any case. The lead actress insists on giving birth at home, doesn't go to the hospital when the midwife says she needs to, yet they try to portray her as a smart working woman. The rest of the film she just walks around in a daze until its ends and it shows her with about a ten year old daughter.. There is no closure or resolving any relationship and I was left not really caring what happened. I don't recommend this film.",Pieces of a Woman
107,spaulagain,"Meh, disappointed",7,8 January 2021,"I went in with high expectations. I heard great things about the film and really enjoy Venessa Kirby. I will say the direction was great, and the acting as well. Kirby certainly delivered.The writing however lacked heart, it was very dry and every character was an unlikeable piece of trash. Even Martha, the one we're supposed to feel complete empathy with, felt dull and uninteresting. The ""big"" scene was well done, but with no good set up for the characters, even it didn't deliver (no pun intended). I also found the case against the midwife and the court hearings to be a bit unbelievable and forced.I may actually fault the director here as well. This type of dry melancholy direction with a story and characters that lack any impact doesn't work. You need at least one of the big 3 factors to impact the viewer. Even the score failed to really engaged the viewer.The end really seals the deal as a film trying to be super artsy and impactful, but it just doesn't ever get me onboard.As someone who lost a sibling from a failed pregnancy, and has close friends who've lost their children during pregnancy, I was expecting to be fully riveted and heart broken by the end of the film. Instead I was just disappointed.",Pieces of a Woman

What was I doing watching this one night by myself? I'm not too too sure myself, to be honest with you. I felt like watching something a little different for me but something with meaning. I chose well. 'Pieces Of A Woman' was free on Netflix so what had I to lose?I did expect it to be what they termed back in the day 'a woman's weepy' but I had heard it was given good reviews. I wasn't really expecting a Bergman style saga complete with that directors ability to make powerful, raw and intense films
The direction of this film made the story similarly engrossing by keeping the pace steady rather than hurrying things on or stagnating the narrative with overlong scenes. This was greatly helped by visionary camera camera work which although often inventive and somewhat idiosyncratic was never intrusive.Added to the excellent direction (I will have to check out the directors other films) was the effective rather than showcased performances of the cast and a very realistic script.There's a bit of a 'everything gets resolved' relatively happily style ending but even that is probably the most plausible.

My wife and I were crying like babies because the energy of the film was so intense. Shia LaBeouf put on a tour de force. Due to the controversy surrounding his personal life, I highly doubt he receives any awards for his performance. I also believe he was playing himself. No acting was done on his part.

114,Filmiarvustus,For when you want to cry yourself empty,8,29 March 2021,"""Pieces of a Woman"" is built around eight different days, as it depicts the life of Martha changes after a tragic incident. This is a character-driven story complimented by Vanessa Kirby's Oscar-worthy performance, as well as Shia Labeouf's painful take on the partner's role. The narratice is superb since every piece of dialogue is deeply connected to the main story yet the overall effect of naturalism is unaffected. The movie has your immediate attention when camerawork by Benjamin Loeb turns into a character in itself with perhaps one of the best single takes ever made. The starting sequence is so powerful, that it overshadows the rest of the film. Overall it is almost too brutal and honest at times, but always extremely powerful.",Pieces of a Woman

116,AxProductions,A realistic story,7,3 June 2021,"This film has a great story, told through a pretty objective point of view, it makes non of the characters seem as specifically ""Good"" or ""Bad"", but just there, making up their own opinions, and realistically, I think depending on the person who watches the film, there will be a different opinion on who is Good and Bad.This is further exaggerated by the pretty great performances by the cast, every character has their own set of beliefs, and the way they clash creates a beautifully realistic representation of a child's death, and the effect that has on people. Through performance, the differences between mother and father are shown, as they go their separate ways due to the death of the baby, and the way blame is constantly shifted adds to how all the different characters feel.The script is also pretty incredible on all levels, however the film does have quite a few down side.Fist of all it's defiantly way too long, I had to take a couple days to watch it due to it's shear length, this may be due to the film having so many long takes which just didn't precisely fit the mood of the film, I don't know if that was down to editing or cinematography though.

119,thatfilmperson,A story worth sharing.,8,30 March 2021,"If you liked:
Manchester by the Sea
Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Always
The Farewell""Pieces of a Woman"" is a really tough 2020 drama based on the experiences of a Hungarian screenwriter Kata Wéber and her partner, director Kornél Mundruczó, who lost their child during Wéber's pregnancy. The couple was unable to cope with the unfathomable loss, so Kata moved to Berlin on her own, where she wrote the screenplay. The film mirrors their sorrow, as a young woman (the stunning Vanessa Kirby) loses a child during homebirth. It is a deeply personal story of mourning, fractured relationships and learning to live with an incomprehensible loss. The pair have channeled their grief into art, which both actors Vanessa Kirby and Shia LaBeouf magically picked up in their portrayal.Now, that brief summary would do a great disservice to an unbelievably powerful film. The opening birth scene which lasts 30 (!) intensely difficult minutes has the entire emotional turmoil of a 10-12 hour delivery: first it was terrifying, then it was beautiful; first funny, then awful; first joyous then devastating; an absolutely, heart-breakingly horrible, exciting and magical experience. According to the Russian director and producer @alexander.rodnyansky one of the best scenes in the history of cinema of the last 25 years, and I agree. I honestly did not think it was possible to act out something as personal and emotional as childbirth so unbelievably well (especially considering that Vanessa Kirby never had a child of her own, her preparation work was practically just video-research and going to actual deliveries). For that reason I just refuse to consider any possible choice for the Best Actress Oscar this year other than Kirby, hers was the only female performance I've seen this year that involved actual top-level acting, and it has most definitely launched her from playing mindless Mission Impossible beauties deep into the jungle of Hollywood.The rest of the film is just as well-acted as the beginning, despite it being much slower and ""drier"" than that incomparable opening. The main takeaway, just like from the 2019 film ""The Farewell"" is that there is no correct way to grieve. When something happens that is so awful that your usual worldview is no longer viable, you are left fragmented, in Pieces, and everybody has their own personal ways of dealing with something like that. We get a look on some of the best thing and some of the worst things one can do as a couple in such a horrible situation.Despite it being undeniably depressing this is a story truly worth seeing and sharing, because such stories are happening to real people around the world at this very moment. Available on Netflix.",Pieces of a Woman

I also felt it had realism to it without being too graphic. The story is indeed a sad one, but stayed above the hankie degree and depicted the real discomfort of the thing humans are worst at. That is dealing with other peoples tragedies, AND dealing with those people when the tragedies are ours. We just all either sink under our turtlenecks or worse, some sound like they just swallowed a self help book on grieving. Add a court drama to round out the whole affair and it COULD HAVE been overdone, (& like oscarbait scenes in some places reminded me this IS an actor's movie) as it goes through the incremental timeline we see pain, crazy,healing & abandonment, as well as new focus for the family with Burnstyn's feisty Survivor matriarch becoming more fragile. So the the court was the bookend for the film's dramatic opening. They didn't take too long or speak too low like some drams do. The dialogue was great for some characters; it felt Siobhan from Succession literally didn't change clothes from her HBO character! LOL she even sounded AND acted like Shiv!! 😉 In the end most everyone survives the death of a baby, as in life but they aren't the people they were. I recommend this on rainy Sunday afternoon after papers & tea, without reading too many reviews. I am glad I didn't even read or watch the trailer. Netflix did it again. I have had a bad run run of starting some of their series' and almost gave up. Their films are better. Maybe theres just too much of it.

Did they try to parallel the experience of this young woman, surpassing a deep life crisis after a miscarriage, on the formal level and the structure of the movie? The film never recovers from its strong first 30 min, after this you have the feeling it breaks into pieces, like the life of this young woman itself. Sequences seem fractured and shattered, not really motivated or combined in a convincing way. Dialogue and acting often seems loosely improvised and unconnected.
La Beouf's part for example, the most unconvincingly motivated character for me, suddenly loosing any connection, vanishing out of sight. But that's exactly the way the grieving mother must have felt it herself! Maybe they did that intentionally to give us the feeling of loss, pain, anger and emotional estrangement this woman is going through. Strong supporting acts by Ellen Burstyn and Molly Parker. But the movie's core and center is Vanessa Kirby here, giving a breathtaking performance, she carries this film almost alone.

130,sherripadgitt,Quite unbelievable as portrayed,6,8 January 2021,"Pet peeves first:
Coming from a nurse, I saw so many things wrong with the opening scenes in this that I just wanted to stop watching, but I continued to see where the story would go. The story lags in the middle, but picks up towards the end. The details lack substance and don't seem to be based in reality.First off, the midwife did not take any vital signs of the mother. That would have been the first thing she would have done upon arriving. She would have also kept monitoring those signs just as she did the baby's as the mom progressed. If the midwife did not do those things, then yet, that would be gross and extreme negligence on her part regardless of what she wanted the outcome to be.Secondly the portrayal of showing the laboring woman in a ""semi-lethargic"" and delirious state was very misleading. Labor pain doesn't make one lose consciousness; it does the opposite.Lastly, in the courtroom scene, lawyer and her client are not together in what the lawyer is going to ask her. Most always client and lawyer are together on what questions will be asked before so client is prepared.To sum it up, I feel that this was poorly written and some simple research could have gone a long way with this film to tighten up the loose areas to make it a wonderful film. Also, cut out some of the fluff in the middle where nothing is happening. The acting was amazing by all. I loved Vanessa Kirby and Shia LeBouf.

131,goldenlampshade,True filmmaking fireworks with great performances to match,9,19 January 2021,"The Oscar Expert said this of Pieces of a Woman and in particular its capstone scene, and I agree. Fantastic, bombastic, and memorable are the only words that can describe Vanessa Kirby, Shia Leboeuf, the cinematography and the score. It truly felt as cold as Boston and it is always nice to see home on screen, the orange hue of the beginning to the blues grays and whites of the rest of the movie save the final two shots, all incredible. And its score was punchy and classic in a way I'd want to throw on in the morning while drinking a cup of coffee if I ever did that.The courtroom scene stood out to me the most for Kirby and would be the reason why I wouldn't mind if she snags a few Best Actress awards here and there since she is absolutely undeniable. Shame it was a mit misguided at times with certain scenes because all together I totally understand how this movie mirrors real life in a way that is messy and cinematic which I appreciated a lot given the true inspiration of the script. I would want to rewatch it asap but besides the electric beginning I anticipate have to struggle though a lot to get to the other side of the film unfortunately the Sara Snook stuff but who knows plus gotta love my Succession gal. And Benny Sarfdie hello!The bridge and apple motifs are my favorite part about the film and why I think it deserves better critical reception as a whole.

Far from being a portrait of grief, this story is really about intergenerational trauma and its downstream effects which include narcissism and entitlement.Of course Martha could have heeded the midwife's advice to go to the hospital and her baby would have had a decent chance at survival. But then we would not have this movie and the opportunity to watch her blame everyone else but herself for her own poor choices which include her man-child partner.Ready to drag the midwife's name through the mud, Martha's mother launches a spurious lawsuit against her for malpractice and proceeds even after admitting to Martha that she did a poor job as a mother and failed to impart motherly wisdom to her daughter which might have prevented the tragedy.It is just so narcissistic. Who gave any consideration to the midwife and what she was going through? She might have blamed herself for not having saved the child. What about the strain on her family and her finances? She was announced in court as ""former midwife"" so her career has also been ruined.At the end we see an ending that someone like Martha perhaps does not deserve. A second chance.

138,bluenoseneil,"Very hard to rate this highly, but I will",8,8 July 2021,Simply focusing on the subject material and how hard this is to watch makes it difficult to rate too highly. The performances from Vanessa Kirby and Ellen Burstyn are exceptional and it is a very emotional movie about human tragedy and loss. Even if one has experienced this you can still feel what it must be like for any mother and father who loses a child this way. So very sad but important nonetheless to consider.,Pieces of a Woman
139,KingOfHungary,Good film reaching but failing to be Great,6,13 September 2020,"It's a well acted tragic story that starts off excellently, but falls apart bit by bit the longer it goes until it ends on a whimper, as if the story got tired. Vanessa Kirby is equal parts excellent, and yet underacted in a sort of apathetic manner, where it began to hurt the story itself because her behavior was not shown to have anything underlying it, but her surface level was her entire level. Shia was excellent, as was the Mother. The film is very much in the style of Hungarian films, as the director is, and I say this in the way that this film could and would have been shot as a Hungarian film and played out exactly the same, if it had not been North American. In fact, it feels like an American adaptation of an existing Hungarian film, but this is it. The tone of the film jerks around somewhat, going with hard, every day realism, with odd smatterings of symbolism that just don't mesh well and come up like worn down speed humps on your drive, so instead of you getting seamless symbolism, they are stark and you are slapped aware of them when they show up. The dialogue is very good and realistic, except for a few instances where they get speechy and you start to fall out of the immersion because of it. The cinematography is very great, and the music works well. I think with some tweaks this could have been a great, even excellent movie, but what we got is a hampered result.",Pieces of a Woman
140,vinifernandes,"Pieces of a Woman, her Mother, and a Man",7,28 February 2021,"There so much more aspects of motherhood that need to be considered in our society. In the movie ""Pieces of a Woman"", losing a child is more than just a trauma, it is a part of you that goes along.The movies starts with the beginning of a construction of a bridge (Sean's job).Vanessa Kirby (Martha), brilliantly portrays the reflection of a woman who has lost her identity. The only thing that would fulfill her, and her husband Sean (interpreted by Shia LaBeouf): their first child. Considering the different traits of personalities, Martha and Sean, can't seem to get back on track with their lives. With the interference of her mother, Elizabeth (amazingly interpreted by Ellen Burstyn), they try to find closure upon a trial against the doctor who did their home delivery.With all that has happened their relationship is also shattered by the pain of losing their only child. Consequently, their are not able to make it work, and start to look things on a different perspective.What intrigued me the most about this movie, is the development of Shia's character in the film. At a certain point he is a caring man, and then he is conveyed as a abusive, egocentric man that uses adultery and drugs to heal his wounds. The severe types of abuse, in the second act, show how they writers did not used the right methods to show a real husband, but just a monster who is created in two separated, agressive, scenes. Even so, the impactful movements of Martha and Sean's relationship are determined by her mother, Elizabeth. After several actions, in the second act, we are supposed to think Elizabeth is a kind of person who is trying to get her daughter a fresh start, even if it is by the wrong terms.Additionally, the pace of Martha's story and her emotional development is portrayed beautifully. Some of her scenes are very aggressive, and impactful. Vanessa has an amazing performance and makes us feel the experience with her. The director, also uses a lot of different aspects to represent Martha's emotions and what she is feeling (plants dying with her relationship, seeds growing in the end when she starts to find closure).Between all the distress of losing a daughter, the director also sets the chronological line by the construction of a bridge. Which is a representation of arranging something that is broken or fallen into pieces (Martha and her identity as a woman).In conclusion, the movie it is based on a really good plot and Vanessa's steals the spotlight by her brilliant performance.",Pieces of a Woman

Vanessa Kirby and Shia LaBeouf were both great but there were moments in both of their performances that were just a little bit off. The highlight of the film has got to be its opening scene which is about 27 minutes long. This scene was absolutely incredible and highly salute them for their work. After that the movie goes up and down over and over again. It's meant to be sad and heartbreaking but I just didn't REALLY feel that when I was watching.",Pieces of a Woman
143,sebastianschlicht,"Despite many strenghts, the film unfortunately does not escape some annoying clichés...",6,15 January 2021,"The relatively young Hungarian director Kornél Mundruczó released his first English-language work ""Pieces of a Woman"" for Netflix in 2020. The film reminds me a lot of ""Marriage Story"" by Noah Baumbach: A rare addressed topic was implemented in a very natural and impressive way. At least at the beginning of the film, after that it gets a bit weak, but one thing at a time. At first, I don't recommend reading any trailers or synopsis about the film. The less you know about the film, the better. All you have to know that ""Pieces of a Woman"" is a story about grief and loss.That's why I can´t continue with the summary of the plot...Mundruczó's film is really impressive in many ways. The cast is strong with Shia LaBeouf, Ellen Burstyn, and even Benny Safdie in a supporting role. Vanessa Kirby also convinced me very much. So far I only knew her from ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" and there she couldn't show much of her acting skills. Every actor was good (regardless of the script). Thanks to Benjamin Loeb's great camera work, the actors are also able to show a lot. Only few cuts cuts are made here and the first 20-30 minutes in particular were impactful.I was really captivated at the beginning and I thought this movie was going to be great. Unfortunately it kept getting worse in my opinion. There´s a scene, where one of the characters suddenly behaves in a completely harsh manner, in a typical Hollywood manner. I lost all empathy for this character and I was pulled out of the story. After that it didn't get any better too. For me it is primarily due to the script, especially with its dialogues, which over the course of the story have become increasingly pretentious and artificial. The film deals with a difficult topic in which some people can behave irrationally or very emotional. But here it rarely felt natural or real to me, which is sad because of that powerful start.The score by Howard Shore had also a lot of weak points. The music was unnecessary and intrusive in most oft he scenes.Conclusion: This movie is unfortunately very disappointing. ""Pieces of a Woman"" has a strong prologue, great actors and some impressive camera work. But in the end it is (most of the time) the script that defines a film. So here too. And sadly that couldn't convince me ...",Pieces of a Woman

147,A-Finn,"Pieces of a Whoa, man...What?",2,6 April 2021,"This film tries to tell how constant sorrow can ruin anybody. The story revolves around a woman who deals with an unexpected tragedy and learns to live the ensuing months of grief. Does it succeed in delivering the story? Not really.The lead surely delivers some convincing-yet-not-believable performance; but unfortunately, the poor script and terrible direction made this whole drama as bland as its dialogues, let alone its unrealistic overlong (thirty-damn-minute) home labour scene (in which its portrayal of accuracy is highly questionable and feels redundant). The slow glacial-burn paced plot doesn't bother some viewers (like me) but their extraneous shot choices ruin this movie, big time.I mean, what's with the vague close-up of neck and shirt collar shot? Do they try to show us the character's vein and heartbeat or something? And that's not even the least of it. To be fair, the film score is fine. The third/final act is, I think, supposed to be melodramatic climax but it's just as hollow as the lead's unnerving speech; not to mention its rushed, inexplicable ending.Overall, the film's writing was dreadful, and its direction even worse. The filmmakers failed to portray the ""feel"" of such broken-hearted person and people who live around them. The drama depicts a lot less emotion and soul. Audience can hardly sympathize and feel the sadness of its characters. The writer and director should be accountable to this heartless drama.I am totally befuddled by them high praises and glowing reviews of this piece of overrated drama. I would say this film is pieces of a sorrow montage--if not a huge mess.1.7/10.",Pieces of a Woman
148,shellymdsparks,Very disappointed.,3,28 January 2021,"Great acting however it feels like so much was left out. The dots didn't connect. First, the midwife suggested they go to the hospital at what appeared to be at a reasonable point. Very little time occurred between when the 2 (slow) heart rates were taken and the time she asked the father to call 911. And while the mother did not want to go to the hospital she also didn't insist he not call 911. It seemed like everything progressed the way it should, at least according to how it was filmed. If the heart rate was slow towards the beginning of the birth then she let the birth proceed that would be different. Second, the midwife didn't a monitor the mother's heart rate. Isn't that standard? Lastly, the trial came across as a last minute rush by the writers and director to wrap things up. It was quick, unrealistic and really offered no real facts. I found the whole trial very strange. All in all i felt like I was getting little pieces of a story quickly thrown together. It was really hard to connect to any of the characters. Such a shame because it could have been a really powerful story.",Pieces of a Woman

And then it hits you.I can never understand the pain of losing a child, hopefuly I never will.

Speaking as a male heterossexual dude, I don't remember ever seing the most difficult time in a woman's life being the sole focus of a mainstream movie, but it is and Vanessa nails it, bringing us to tears with the importance of talking about the trauma of it.

164,westerfieldreviews,The Tissues of Trauma,7,23 January 2021,"Kornél Mundruczó and Kata Wéber work in tandem to tell a gripping story that brings light to the individual ways in which loss affects us all. Adapted to the screen from Mundruczó and Wéber's stageplay of the same name, ""Pieces of a Woman"" is a beautiful film that sadly proves to be less than the sum of its parts. From Mundruczó's intimate style behind the camera, to the captivating performances of Vanessa Kirby & Shia LaBeouf, and Howard Shore's poignant tone-setting score, ""Pieces of a Woman"" has all of the markings a magnificent film should possess. Unfortunately, much of what the film presents to the audience is never done in a tactful way. Instead, subtext is thrown to the wayside in favor of a more heavy-handed approach to storytelling. In an attempt to deliver a thought-provoking piece of work that tackles the complicated and heavy subject matter of familial loss, ""Pieces of a Woman"" finds itself marred down by its own lack of focus.""Pieces of a Woman"" tells a complicated story of love and loss over the span of roughly eight months, with each month effectively being a contained chapter that smoothly bookends events keeping the plot in motion. We follow Martha (Vanessa Kirby) and Sean (Shia LaBeouf), two soon to be parents living in Boston expecting their first child. Suddenly one night, Martha begins to feel a heavy wave of contractions which prompts Sean to call their midwife Barbara who informs them that she is currently unavailable, however, in her stead she sends Eva (Molly Parker) to cover the procedure. At first, all appears to be going well, but when the baby's heart rate begins to plummet, Eva realizes that the child's life may be in danger. Acting quickly, Eva orders Sean to call the paramedics while she does her best to safely help deliver their daughter. Yet, the delivery goes well, with Martha being able to successfully push her baby out giving her and Sean the chance to hold and love their newborn daughter for a single tender moment. And a single tender moment it is, as mere seconds later, Eva notices that their daughter's skin has lost its natural complexion and turned into a shade of dark blue. Eva rushes into action in an attempt to save the child's life as Sean darts out of their home leading the paramedics inside. What occurs over the next seven months is a journey for both Martha and Sean as their relationship is vigorously tested. Each copes with the loss of their daughter through different means in an attempt to find clarity and come to peace. All the while, outside forces involving family and friends, push and pull Martha and Sean in a variety of directions until emotions reach their natural breaking points.The opening labor scene in ""Pieces of a Woman"" lasts roughly around twenty-five minutes and is truly a remarkable sequence that so preciously captures the immense weight of the situation by holding you tight and never letting go. Mundruczó's use of a continuous shot during this sequence makes us, the audience more than just passive bystanders and instead reels us in as active participants. We travel with Kirby and LaBeouf as they navigate their home, we feel the stress, the fear, and the anxiety with every passing second. The intimacy of this scene functions so well that in spite of us only knowing these characters for five minutes prior, we sit at the edge of our seats anticipating what will happen next by hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst. This one moment sets the stage and tells us that no matter what is to come, we should expect nothing less than stellar camera work. And I can safely say that Mundruczó does not falter in his work. Throughout the entire film, Mundruczó and company use the camera to seamlessly weave through the environments which in turn gives every scene a natural flow that keeps our attention every step of the way. We grow familiar with the spaces in which the camera occupies and we feel the rich emotions our characters feel, and none of that would be possible without Mundruczó's exceptional directing.""Pieces of a Woman"" puts Vanessa Kirby and Shia LaBeouf at center stage as the main leads, and their performances are truly nothing short of remarkable. Kirby and LaBeouf both perfectly capture the raw emotional essence of the script further making you believe in these characters and this story. We witness how Kirby closes herself off wishing to sever the past while creating a distance between all of her loved ones as she battles with those around her who wish to tell her how to properly respond. LaBeouf's spiral into old habits and his damaging cycle of grief is something that will simultaneously make you frown in sorrow as you shake your head in disappointment. Kirby and LaBeouf give it their all in every moment ensuring to handle every sequence with care by refraining from ever overselling or underselling a single scene. Alongside them, Kirby and LaBeouf are joined by Ellen Burstyn (as Elizabeth) whose power and presence will have you sigh out of vexation until you smile with sympathy. Molly Parker (as Eva) for what limited time she has on-screen delivers so much with so little as she brilliantly runs the gamut of emotion from start to finish. Every last one of these performers delivers nothing less than quality work as they fantastically elevate Wéber's raw script to new heights. It is the performances found within this film that are the true backbone of this engrossing narrative.Despite every individual aspect of ""Pieces of a Woman"" being executed well, the film ultimately suffers from having a plot which sets out to tell so much, that at times it loses its clear focus. We sit with the trauma, we get familiar with it, and some may even understand it, but personally, the film never enthralled me quite like I had anticipated it would. The entire opening of the film is outstandingly gripping, but sadly, the remainder of the film never lives up to that level of both visual and narrative storytelling. Beautiful fleeting character moments are sprinkled all throughout the film and handled tremendously well, while others feel forced as they try their best to elicit a response that it has unfortunately not earned. It is for this reason, that ""Pieces of a Woman"" stands as such a mixed bag; it promises a great deal of intrigue with a story that focuses on a universal nightmare we all share, yet, the film does not maintain the high level of quality its subject matter so desperately deserves.",Pieces of a Woman
165,SimonsRants,Moments of Brilliance... But Only Moments,6,1 March 2021,"The film opens with a 22-minute single shot that is both amazing to watch and devastating to witness due to the brutal subject matter; the realism and expert writing and acting in those moments was absolutely spell-binding. Unfortunately, the rest of the film never quite lives up to that.I've read from other reviewers that the other 1.5 hours was pointless and boring and I don't agree; I think the first 30 minutes was merely to set up context for the next hour and half which really was what was important. I just don't think the rest of the movie was able to either live up to the high bar the first scene set for it or to fully live up to my own expectations I had set before the film ever began.The film is about a woman struggling to deal with the trauma of loss. There are many factors to that such as dealing with family, dealing with friends, dealing with the practical steps needed to be taken afterward and most importantly dealing with the situation at home. And although it is realistically shown how devastating an experience like this can be to two people (including the husband) it becomes so depressing and frustrating when it feels as though the characters are making every wrong choice and becoming less likable by the moment. I sympathize with them and I understand why they each made the choices they do... but I do not LIKE any of the characters and I did not care to see how any of them turned out by the end of the film.There is some silver lining to be gleaned, but it's very small. Too small to even mention, in my mind. And the acting isn't enough to completely cover over the inconsistent directing and writing. Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's jarringly bad. I can't say overall that the movie was poorly made (hence the positive rating) but I can't say I'd ever recommend it to anyone nor ever plan to watch it again.",Pieces of a Woman

What follows are glimpses over the next few months of Martha's life, and the confusion of the many emotions, grief, pain, anger, guilt, and navigating these emotions to bring herself back to life despite the conflicting needs of her family and partner.",Pieces of a Woman

181,lucdrouin,"Interesting, but clichéd",6,10 August 2021,"Pieces of a Woman is about a couple losing their newborn child within five minutes of birth. They were helped by a midwife; we are invited to believe that she may have been criminally negligent, although, as we have witnessed the whole birth, it is not clear why. The couple, in love before the birth, grows progressively apart as each one grieves the loss in a his own way, without support of any kind from the other. The family of the mother is of no help, unresponsive to the mother and grieving in its own way. Nobody is trained to be a parent; even less, nobody is trained to be the parent, or grandparent, of a deceased child. That is the premise of a good story.Except that it stopped being good from there. Here is a former loving couple that falls apart like a card castle after a traumatic incident and no attempt whatsoever is been made by each to prevent that crash. It is the main plot hole. And as communication is already very poor between every character, we are to guess what the motivations for their actions are.Finally, in order to bring a feel-good conclusion to this film, we are given a piece of implausible court theatrics like can be seen in so many other films and TV series. An opportunity for learning to cope with terrible grief is being missed. Dommage!",Pieces of a Woman

183,fmilder-533-34251,Vignettes of a woman,4,28 March 2021,"Let's get the obligatory spoiler alert out of the way here, recognizing that this movie's entire advertising campaign is a spoiler alert.Indeed, one enormous complaint about this movie is that whether you found it realistic or not, and whether it gave you insight into this women's pain or not, the opening 30 minutes is the simple anticipation of a coming car wreck in slow motion. You watch what looks to be within the range of normal childbirths (if only we could understand what motivated this woman, living in a city with several of the world's greatest hospitals, to have her baby at home), and you wait, and you wait, and you wait. You know (there's that ad campaign, remember?) that her baby isn't going to make it, and you're just waiting for how and when.That's part of what I don't get about this movie. Do we get any insight into why they are having a home childbirth? Do we get any insight into what might have been done better? What mistake might have been made? I don't think so. This was just a home childbirth that didn't turn out well. Indeed, Mom and Dad literally go the extra length of meeting with the coroner who tells them that. (And, don't you know, this gives Dad a chance to scream at the coroner.)So, why are people giving this stars for the great opening 30 minutes? Perhaps because Ms. Kirby hasn't had a child herself, but she was able to act as if she was? Or perhaps because, after 26 minutes of something that looks like uh, a childbirth, the baby, which had a terrific heartbeat just a few minutes earlier, suddenly doesn't make it? I'll note that we don't see anything actually go wrong, and we don't see ""heroic measures."" We don't get any explanation at all of what went wrong. Frankly, this plays as if we are being taught a lesson: ""You don't have to know what went wrong; all you need to know is that you're a dolt if you decide to play the odds and have a home birth."" I hadn't gone into this expecting a screed about home births, but that seems a rather obvious conclusion from what little we are told.From there, we find out that ""pieces of a woman"" doesn't mean that Martha has lost pieces of herself with her unfortunate newborn. No, the word ""pieces"" seems to just mean ""vignettes."" It's as if we're in acting class - Scene! In this one, you encounter a young child, and it makes you lactate. Scene! In this one you come back to work and everyone stares at you. Scene! In this one, your mother yells at you for having a home childbirth, and you storm off! There's nothing tying these together. I felt like I was watching one-tenth of a far, far better movie, and that the editor chose to keep the plot scenes but leave out the ones that told me why I cared.And then there's the odd laziness/sloppiness of so many plot points - the one EMT truck that says Boston on its side, but not a single other scene recognizable as Boston (yes, I know the movie was largely made in Canada, but then maybe they shouldn't have identified ANY city.). The one, fleeting observation of gravestones with Hebrew on them, and not one other reference, in any way, to any of these characters being Jewish. The prosecutor who is grateful that Mom will testify, but who seemingly never undertakes any witness preparation at all. The judge who lets Mom address the court without so much as a sidebar with the lawyers. And lest we forget - the prosecutor who is both Mom's cousin (!) and having an affair with Dad (!!). Was there a shortage of actors at the Netflix store? The utterly bizarre scene of Mom's mother having an Alzheimer's moment near the end of the movie. The Hallmark-y finish showing mom with a blonde tree-climbing child at the end. Was it hers? Is the child adopted? Is Mom remarried? (For that matter, was Mom married in the first place? I was surprised by the courtroom scenes in which Dad was referred to as her ""partner,"" but maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention in the introductions.)Finally, there are so many other small, but distracting errors - the photo store that lets Mom come into the darkroom, and pull her developing photo out of the chemicals. The judge referring to the case as ""the State versus ...."" When in Massachusetts, that would be ""the Commonwealth versus ..."".Yes, I'm probably piling on at this point, but I really, truly, don't get it. There's a great basic premise here that could have been made into a great movie. But this sure isn't it.",Pieces of a Woman

I gave 1 star for the realism or the birth, 1 for Ellen Burstyn's performance, and 1 for Vanessa Kirby's convincing portrayal of an American. Other than the first 30 minutes, where we witness the baby's birth, there were several jumps from point to point without any transition. For instance, when did they decide on making a headstone for her grave? why did Sean and Elizabeth jump from bonding together over Martha to her declaring that she never liked him and gave him a (apparently - we never saw) big check to leave and never come back? Why did he take the check and head to Seattle without even a good-bye kiss to the woman he supposedly loved and had a baby with? Where does Lucy come from at the end of the movie and why do we never get another shot of Martha's face, even though she had ending lines? Then there were strange unnecessary camera angles, like in the courtroom scene. Why are we staring at the neck of the person speaking instead of their face?As I said in the beginning; others may understand and enjoy movies like this.

I think the reason people are lost after the first 15 minutes is because it starts on such a dramatic and captivating scene before dealing with the aftermath of that scene for the rest of the picture. However, the rest of the movie, is so quite perfectly paced itself. Are all of the scenes entertaining? Definitely not.

And movie after which I am never going to be the same. It shook me to the core. Affected me so much.For some time it wasn't clear to me how this movie holds such a bad score. And then on January 7th, when it started showing on Netflix the score started to go up. And I thought - well yeah, that's more realistic, because I never wanted to believe that this movie is that bad.Yes, the first 30 minutes of the film are agonising and tough, but it's very important because from that moment the main plot started to unfold. And further, we witnessed many new small plots which weren't elaborated (and yeah, that's the main weakness of the film) but I don't mind.
All that characters and their plots led to the main and most important one and that is the pain of the mother. The pain of losing a child and how she copes with it. That tragic event affected everyone in their surroundings, but I liked it that it narrows it to the mother. Because this movie is about the pain and trauma of the mother. And oh my god, how magnificent Vanessa Kirby (Martha) holds and carries the whole movie. Her facial expressions, reactions, thinking are mesmerizing. I want for her to be recognized for this role in upcoming awards shows! And that metaphor with the apples shines in whole glory at the end. I cried my guts out.Almost to forget to mention that monolog of Martha's mother! That scene! O wow.Days after watching I still think about this film.

I did, I felt like Martha (Vanessa Kirby) acted beautifully and authentically as a woman experiencing the numbness of an excruciating loss, everything would set her off and yet it was like she was on autopilot. I don't think the film lagged at all - it was shot beautifully. The music score made me feel as though it was something Martha would have played in the background. Sean (Shia Labeouf) acted well but the character annoyed me - yes he was grieving but it escalated the ending of their relationship because he was just so out of sync and needed so much from Martha. Martha's mother really bugged me - she seemed so controlling and just plain would not listen to her daughter when she practically screamed that she did not want to pursue the case. The court scene made me cry, it was as though Martha drew back a curtain and saw her loss for what it was and what it would always be, not something that can be changed by a court case.

Might be difficult to watch if you've lost a baby at birth. The acting is good enough, but there's not an ounce of joy in the movie. Vanessa's character seems to be walking through life not really attached, before or after birth of baby. . Shia's character has some interest going in the beginning but after their baby dies the movie continues on a flat line as does Shia and Vanessa's characters. The movie continues flat only to give way when Burstyn wants to drive home an emotional point or two. In the end the writer gives a glimpse in how Vanessa's character evolved, but no details, just a nagging, ""do ya think?"" And Shia is out of the total picture by the funeral, never to return. And, I feel it's about Shia's character losing his self and Vanessa's character finding her self. A tragedy will either make you or break you. Not a film I'd pay special money to see.

207,gregmehlin,Some Great Elements but Falls Short,6,14 January 2021,"Vanessa Kirby gives an excellent leading performance and will very deservedly be up for several awards I'm sure, but the film surrounding her is usually not on the same level.
The delivery scene is a stellar moment that really has you on the edge of your seat the whole time. The performances are great and feel very real, and the sheer amount of time that the one take goes on for, especially in such an emotional moment was extremely impressive.
Unfortunately the movie peaks early with that scene and never recaptures that same magic. That's not to say there aren't occasional moments of greatness though. But as a whole, this is a truly dark film, and as someone who likes dark films, it can be very hard to get into. Unlike something like Manchester by the Sea, there is no levity present here at all, and the sheer scope of tragedy present will be a deal breaker for many.
But like I said, Kirby's performance is really fantastic, as is the great Ellen Burstyn who much like Kirby will be in the running to add a few more awards onto her shelf. Her big moment isn't the best written in the world, but she makes you forget that with her passionate performance that reminds you why she's an icon of cinema. Additionally, while Molly Parker is a small role, I really liked her work her as well. She had a calming, lovely presence that also effortlessly turned to deadly seriousness and sadness. I would've liked to see more of her, but given what the story is going for, I understand the limitations of the role.
I thought the execution of the husband character could've been done a lot better. We spend a long amount of time with him, and Shia LaBeouf was pretty much Vanessa Kirby's co-lead for most of the film, but then he winds up becoming a nonentity with no resolution, which makes you wonder why we watched him for so long.
I did think the climax of the movie helped it regain its balancing though and it ended on a high note. While I disagree with the handling of Shia's character, having this section focused on Kirby and rid of his scenes allowed it to be a much more emotional and resonant story.
Overall, it's an okay film with some excellent highs, but they're too few and far between. Still, it's worth watching for Kirby and Burstyn's performances which are top notch, and the delivery scene alone is brilliant.",Pieces of a Woman
208,oldpaperpeddlers,I wanted to care--but ........,1,26 October 2021,"I didn't like the movie. Period. There are plenty of reviewers who tell you what the story is about so won't get into that. There are a few spoilers here.From the start I didn't like the characters. Any of them. The opening sequence puts us right into the at-home birth scene which doesn't give us a chance to ""bond"" with the characters. I guess we're supposed to be awed by the spectacle of birth and that substitutes for characterization?In the opening sequence a baby is born and dies. Segue to many weeks later as Martha and Sean are trying to adapt to the loss. I actually feel empathy for him, not much for her. They're really not a happy couple. We have no idea what their relationship was like before the birth except for a few comments that indicate she's keeping score on his sobriety and that immediately turned me off her. Then she shuts Sean out after the birth as if he had no part in the making of their child and his own hopes and expectations for fatherhood. That turned me off. SHE made the decisions about *their* baby's body donation to science vs traditional burial, *she* decided to undo the nursery, etc. As if it were HER child and not THEIRS. That disturbed me. I liked her less. Sure, she was suffering but so was Sean. How they grieved together--or rather NOT together--showed how empty their relationship really was.Her mother's interference was something she could have managed better or dealt with properly but didn't and allowed it to play into Sean's insecurities. Skip ahead some months and Sean is cheating and doing drugs. Martha is drinking and out clubbing without Sean. That's when I had enough of trying to care about these people, skipped ahead several times to see how it actually ends. But really, despite her apparently coming to her senses late and deciding she didn't blame the midwife for her baby's death, I really didn't care. It was too late.Yes, people grieve differently, they behave badly at times, they don't know how to process something like this as a couple, etc. But there has to be something likable or empathetic about an individual to make me care in the beginning and it just wasn't there for me.At the end we see she's apparently had another child, a little girl who's climbing an apple tree and Sean is nowhere in sight and I just don't care. My concern is, THIS is who the child has for a mother? Poor kid.I wish I could get back the time I wasted trying to watch this.",Pieces of a Woman

Either of these movies would have been great, but this movie, in trying to be both, fails at both. Furthermore, the middle section really drags. The grief of the couple and their nearest and dearest seemed to manifest itself in nothing but meanness to each other.

219,GGSteven_93,A HARROWING EXPERIENCE PROPLED BY ITS CAST.,8,10 January 2021,"Pieces of Woman, directed by Hungarian director Kornel Mundroczo and written by his wife, Kata Weber tell a harrowing story about child loss and its consequences. Both, Kornel and Kata based the story on personal experience as they have gone through a similar experience, the couple losing a child too.What makes the film so special, is its stellar cast, and also its opening 30 minutes after, which the film never really manages to pick up, but nevertheless delivers. Regarding the cast, they equally pull plenty of weight and they each have their moments to shine. Some considerable moments are the ones when Martha (Vanessa Kirby) and Elizabeth (Ellen Burstyn) address the camera directly and providing some intense performances, which will pull plenty of cords during the viewing. Shia LeBeouf does an amazing job too, but unfortunately, he might be quite hard to watch for some as he plays a relapsing and abusive husband.Now, the opening 30 minutes need to be mentioned as they are breath-taking. These opening 30 minutes keep the viewer constantly on the edge of their seats as the labour process is being captured on camera. The scene is really elevated by its camera work and its direction as they never seem too intrusive, the whole process of the labour feeling really observational.While the film never picks up again after the harrowing first 30 minutes, the film still packs plenty of tear-jerking moments especially aided by its stellar cast, though certain moments will feel too forced or melodramatic, losing some of its observational qualities. Nevertheless, the film looks like a serious contender for the Oscars and award season, especially within the acting category. Definitely, give it a watch!Score: 8/10.",Pieces of a Woman

If you are an intelligent, sophisticated viewer or cinema aficionado please do yourself a favor and brace yourself for mental pain and visual torture, because its bleak photography, unpleasant angles, wonderful actors acting out array of insufferable characters, and of course slow unjustified pacing. Whom to blame, one may ask? Definitely not actors. Those did their best. I guess this film is a summary result of ""talented"" script writer and equally ""talented"" director. Pieces of a woman ?

221,mongbei,Why treat decent men so badly?,5,31 January 2021,"Well acted, though a little disjointed.
However I would like to focus on one aspect - the part of the husband in the film. What had he done to deserve such poor treatment? There was some simmering resentment about the wealthy mother-in-law's insistence to be always involved, and her snobbery towards his manual work.Sure - the woman had borne the child and physically suffered, but he had played his part in the marriage, worked hard, supported his pregnant wife, done everything expected of him. His wife then ignored his request to bury the baby and instead gave the body to science. His grief was completely sidelined. While everyone worried about the mental state of the woman, nobody thought to give him support (apart from the physical support the lawyer gave him). Then, the mother-in-law simply paid him to go away and 'never come back'. What was that about? The woman, or her sister, might have been expected to show some empathy with the husband but there was not one shred of it.In the end the woman is reconciled with her mother, and the final shot suggests, ambiguously, that she goes on to have a child in some happy ending. But what about the man? They both struggled through their individual grief but there is no indication that the man recovered from his.This treatment of the husband is similar to that of the husband in Marriage Story, which also puts the man as the bumbling, somehow culpable, loser.",Pieces of a Woman
222,trhowever,So messy and illogical,6,9 January 2021,"This film is just a mess without good logic for the story.The scene of childbirth was just a pain to watch, really. The situation looked so disorganised and unprepared that I doubt if they've taken any childbirth class. They were acting like Jen Barber tried to put her dream-shoes on in The IT crowd, which was a comedy! And then came the midwife, acting fairly professional, monitoring stuff, suggesting they go to hospital, et voilà: they wanted to blame her when the child died!And the scenes of Martha after losing her baby were just not understandable. Sometimes quasi sad, sometimes with a sudden grin, but anyway, her mother was determined to take everything under control in her own favour. Does this family just have too much money and time?Somehow the mother teamed up with Sean. Somehow Sean slept with the attorney (is it making fun of the legal system??). Somehow the mother still hated Sean so much that she paid him for having him disappear. Somehow Sean really left. Somehow Martha went to the court, not showing her strength, but blaming her midwife. Somehow Martha loved her mother again. Why why why???If someone has noticed, Sean was on the right-hand side of Martha when the baby came while he was making the photos. And Martha got the photos magically made from her left-hand side?Another bug: Martha was changing her clothes all the time on the same day with her bag looking obviously too empty to carry so many pieces?I absolutely admire Vanessa Kirby, even in this movie.

However, the rest of the film seems contrived and awkward - I ended up losing interest in the characters. I know this is supposed to portray what a marriage in dire straits is, but the main characters' implosive grieving felt a bit too apathetic, and I wasn't able to understand Martha's nor Sean's pain.

Vanessa Kirby truly proves that she is a strong contender as a great actress. Her portrayal of Martha, who has recently lost a new born child, is nothing short of brilliant. It's always a delight seeing Ellen Burstyn. She's always been a strong, dependable actress with a unique screen presence and she succeeds in this supporting role. She has quite possibly the best scene halfway through the movie and she is the type of actress who demands your attention. Now for the negative elements. The acting is so good that one can't help but think that it's wasted due to very sluggish direction and a generally mediocre script. The first 30 minutes are truly compelling. After that, the wheels fall off and the film almost feels like it is being crushed by such strong performances. The film feels a lot longer than what it actually is.

The film touches on aspects of music, aspects of romance/love/sex, aspects of relationships (the film strikes so many hammers against bad/low key creepy, not in any good way, reasons people get into relationships-- not completely against relationships in general) which works with aspects of ideas of family, aspects of pregnancy, aspects of a midwife/child birth/prepping for childbirth, aspects of responsibility, aspects of addiction, aspects of a woman's being, and aspects of nurturing amongst other points.

Also, i disliked the way they downplayed the importance of the grieving father's pain. Or at least, the protagonist doesn't ever care, not even at the end. She never cares about his wishes regarding the baby's remains and even disposes her ashes all by herself. The movie seems to imply that is OK, given that she's the mother and the one most in pain (?).

239,darkomarijancevic,The Drama of Emotional Dullness,8,27 January 2021,"An interesting transplant of the European cinematography onto the US soil. As the story took off, I immediately experienced somewhat of a cognitive dissonance over the fact that US English was spoken where I'd usually associate the camera, non-verbal elements, emotions and the setting with a European language. I was soon helped to get over this initial ""language shock"" by a gripping half-hour opening to the movie as well as the captivating performance of the cast in what most people hope would be a routine life event typically ending in joy. Instead we're struck with the movie reality of an opposite outcome.The emphasized ill-green, gray tones and a general lack of vibrant colors present throughout the movie coalesce beautifully with the storyline filled with the gloom of unprocessed grief and broken relationships, until the very end of the movie when glimpses of color make their way onto the screen and develop into a fuller color palette, seemingly breaking the spell of emotional turmoil and informing the viewer the life has moved on and has taken various different forms.Vanessa Kirby did a remarkable job portraying a character who has all the reasons to grieve and yet isn't fully giving herself in to the vulnerability of grief until late in the movie, stoically remaining distant and emotionally shut off, filling the timing of the movie in such a way that I felt drawn into asking what her thoughts were in all those moments - my need for some insight into her thoughts validated by her on-screen partner's line ""a penny for your thoughts"".The other members of the cast all did a great job themselves as they all showed an array of vastly different ways of dealing with loss.From the storyline point of view, I found that all the situations that took place were quite realistic and possible to occur in the wake of dealing with the loss of a baby, however, I'm not quite sure that all of those had to be packed in a single storyline, in order to achieve the point.All in all, this is a great movie for those who find entertainment in reading into emotions that characters display in difficult circumstances of life they are put through.",Pieces of a Woman

Vanessa Kirby gives a moving and unforgiving performance that builds to her speech at the end. The cinematography manages to capture the nuance of Kirby's movements and facial expressions using long takes that primarily focus on her. Shia Labeouf excels at showing us the true nature of his character. Ellen Burstyn shines among good performances of the rest of the cast.

245,samanthabuchanan,Long and clunky,5,24 January 2021,"Vaness Kirby gave a powerful performance as Martha and the opening scene of the birth was acted superbly. However the production was flawed. I felt that the director wanted us to think that the birth was in Real Time, yet it was all so hurried it couldn't possibly have happened in the given half an hour. Then whoever heard of a woman in labour whose eyemake up remains intact? The midwife arrives and doesn't wash her hands. Little irks like this made me lose faith in the drama. There followed a long long tale of recovery with very little words or action. Nearing the end of the story, there is a dinner party and Martha's elderly mother recounts a tragic tale to Martha of her own birth which happened in a ghetto during WW2. That was supposed to be a breakthrough moment in the film. But I kept thinking, surely this story would have been told many times prior to this day. The supposed impact on Martha would have been non existant. The film's last 20 minutes in the courtroom redeemed itself slightly. Again, a wonderful performance from Miss Kirby. But wouldn't she have got the photo of her baby before this point in the film? Maybe not. But I feel that her character would have seized on this memory at a much earlier point. Finally, the film was so heavy on symbolism that it was corny. Martha recovery is metaphored with the end of the harsh winter and the germination of her apple seeds.

The first 30 minutes of it are pure art and the performances by Burstyn and LaBeouf are as great as expected but the great revelation here is Vanessa Kirby who gives a solid performance and makes you really feel for her and her loss.
But the thing with this film is that after those great 30 minutes it feels so flat and the end doesn't really pay. The trial feels very conventional and it is like something we've already seen.
The direction in this film is very well done by Kornél Mundruczó who clearly knows how to make a film but struggles on getting some substance in the script.
I wouldn't say the film is Oscar worthy but the performances of Burstyn and obviously Kirby completely are.
However the film delivers in many aspects but not all of them. Not a bad film but it isn't the best of the century.

The first 30 minutes of the movie shows Martha giving birth and this is a truly amazing scene. Probably one of the best scenes I have seen in a long time and my favorite scene in this movie. I read that Venessa Kirby who played Martha has never given birth before this role, but she gives a truthful performance. Besides Venessa, Shia LaBeouf who played husband, and Ellen Burstyn who played mother give a great performance.However, I'm not fascinated by the plot. I'm not saying it's not good, it is and also there are cool hidden meaning in it, but I expected much more tensions and adrenalin.

Vanessa Kirby has perfectly played the role of Martha who is cheerless and hopeless in her life but at the same time, she wants to rejoice her life again. Vanessa excellently manages to depict these two opposite situations in her acting. Shia LaBeouf flawlessly plays the role of Sean who is expected to shoulder his grieving wife but he is helpless himself. Both characters want to start their life again but are haunted by the past tragedy. Both Vanessa and Shia wear this expression and emotion throughout the film.

Some of the other casting seemed a little questionable. The choice for the sister, Anita but mainly Labeouf as Sean. It seemed to me like type casting, which may have been the point, I'm not sure.

Martha freed the midwife s a way of absolving her conscience. I think the midwife should have told him to call 911 as soon as she didn't hear a heartbeat. I don't think it was manslaughter. But she should have lost the right to practice midwifery. It's a good movie. Strong performances by all. The script flaws rest largely with the overindulgence of the lead character and the casualness in the way she dismissed the father out of her life making him just as sperm donor. A bit much for the man you were willing to have a child with. His character could have used a tiny bit more development.",Pieces of a Woman

Of course, it's pretty rational for the movie to be very sad since the whole plot is about a loss. I would go insofar as to say that sometimes it can be quite difficult to sit through some scenes. Also the movie can sometimes be very slow, but not to the extent of resulting in lose of interest for the film.Overall, it is admittedly a hard movie to watch, however I think that it really succeeds at what it is intended to do: tell a tragic story which is quite difficult to forget..",Pieces of a Woman

Vanessa Kirby is worth all the awards she will run for, that's for sure. Although I think the movie is separated in two parts - the first long scene and the rest, after the title - I disagree with the other user reviews, that claim it lost its purpose. I do not think the movie gets lost in it's own intensity, it just unfolds on a bunch of cruel nuances of different people, perceptions of trauma and trauma reactions. It is clear that their intention is to explore different rhythms, that are explicit on the behavior of each character.It is a cinematic journey, and yes, the acting is the side A on this, but it's a good cut and worth your time, that I am sure. I do not recommend it though if you recently dealt with loss or death near by, you might cry a bunch.I must say Shia Labeouf is great on this but there's just something...

316,kimkeikohealing,"Powerful, but missed some marks.",6,13 January 2021,"Let me say that the first 30 mins of this film is something I will never forget. It was so intimate and realistic that I felt as if I shouldn't be witnessing such a private ordeal. The rest of the film however, I probably will remember faintly. The rest of the movie almost felt disconnected from the beginning in a way. When you start off so strong and intimate, you have to keep it that way for the entirety of the movie or the viewer will feel lackluster towards the end. Don't get me wrong, this is a good film, with some incredible moments, but what stopped it from being great? To be honest, I'm still pondering that. Was it that her mother and husband were so incredibly selfish by putting their needs and ideal's before Martha's without a bit of concern for her's? Was it that Martha put up with it and we never got that satisfactory moment from either of them being able to realize what they were doing was wrong? Was it that after that beginning scene, I never thought Martha and Sean had an ounce of chemistry? Really, looking at them through-out the movie made me question how they even got together in the first place. Couples fight, but this couple had no common ground on anything. Also, Sean and Martha's mother had no redeeming qualities. You could feel some sympathy for them, but the overriding rage for their characters kills it, at least for me. However, I think what ultimately sabotaged this film from greatness that no matter what, until the last 5 minutes of the film, everything and everyone was just grim. It was just an hour of straight depression. I knew after the initial scene this wasn't going to be a happy film but life is bittersweet. This movie was just bitter. No sprinkles of hope for a better future in any instances of the film until the very end. So reasonably, I thought Martha, Sean, or both of them were going to commit suicide or at least attempt it. Honestly, I almost got bored from the constant tone of melancholy but didn't since the movie constantly kept flowing. I was happy however, that they did turn it around at the very end and Martha finally gained peace and happiness in her own way. I personally think the start and the ending scene were perfect but the middle had strong issues. Overall, it's a story that needs to be told and I'm glad they told it.",Pieces of a Woman

318,marissammoy,"Beautiful, Heartbreaking, and Hopeful...",10,10 January 2021,"I'll start by saying I don't write reviews, ever. I intend to but it never usually pans out. So here goes...this film deserves high praise.It may not be everyone's cup of tea but it is well acted, beautifully shot, and really just takes you on a quiet and subtle emotional journey. So, I feel that it is definitely worth a watch if you need that kind of film right now and if you are a fan of pure cinema. It is reminiscent of Kieslowski's Three Colours: Blue.I won't give away any storylines or tell you all the details but the opening scene was so excruciating and triggering to watch, yet I couldn't take my eyes off the screen due to Vanessa Kirby's performance.
Also, Ellen Burstyn really just knocked it out of the park in her role as the mother. Truly she is a legend. There's one scene in particular where she delivers an emotional dialogue that pulls right at your heartstrings and will get you thinking maybe you should really call your mother more often and tell her you love her.Then, there's the music which in my opinion worked seamlessly in showcasing the subtle emotion of certain scenes. Even if it was just a shot of Kirby walking down the street or her in the bathtub holding onto her partner for comfort. The music made you feel what was going on inside.This film resonated with me on a personal level, which is probably a large part of why I loved it so much. It was so engrossing that I was able to have a connection to the story and it's characters. When the acting is done so well and the actors are able to lose themselves, you forget that your watching them on screen.Yes you can break it down, tear it apart piece by piece, and find some small imperfections but overall it's a film that makes you think and hopefully makes you feel.

That is not what happens during labour, especially one without an epidural. Lastly, seriously, what's with all the burping? This is not indigestion for crying out loud...Totally lost me after that.

Their faces are squashed a bit after being pushed the birth canal etc.As for a woman in labour, with a few rare exceptions, it is an immensely painful and powerful experience. The acting or maybe the direction was quite awful. As a woman who has had two babies, completely naturally with zero medication, I can assure you that the way this poor actress was directed to behave during full on labour, was so unrealistic it was like a joke.The rest of the film was so utterly boring, that I found myself looking at the time, wondering when it was ever going to end. I find the glowing reviews and Oscar gossip utterly amazing. Great acting? I do not agree at all. Mediocre at best, I did not connect with a single cast member, nor did I feel any emotion at all.

323,slrinwmsv,How Do We Know it Was Martha and HER Daughter that Appear in the Final Scene?,7,19 January 2021,"To be honest with you, I felt that the midwife was as much a victim as Martha was. When she arrived to assist Martha in childbirth, it was established that she wasn't the midwife that Martha and Sean had chosen. They asked her if she had children, and she replied that she had ""a little girl."" They accepted her services because she was recommended by the original midwife. It appeared to me that she was caring and capable --even though Martha had a preconceived notion of how she wanted the birth to proceed and was trying to stick with it. It was she who, though seeing the couple and their child in the reflection of a mirror, noticed that the baby was in distress, directed Sean to call for EMTs, and who started trying to revive the baby.Other commenters expressed ideas about the ""apple"" theme that evolved, and I respect their opinions. However, the theme haunted me after the movie, and my mind returned to the courtroom scene where Martha was asked by her the midwife's attorney if she had noticed that the baby's hands and feet were purple. She didn't seem to remember. She was asked what her baby looked like and the color of her hair. All she could remember was that she smelled like apples.In the final scene, we never saw the face or body of the woman who was calling out to the girl in the apple tree. Could it be that it was not Martha, but the midwife -- who was also a victim-- and it was her little girl? Could Martha have been smelling apples when holding her baby because the scent was on the midwife because she owned an apple orchard? It seems like a fitting ending to me.Just another possible explanation, but it's the one that makes the most sense to me.",Pieces of a Woman

This film does an amazing job of showing how the tragedy of losing a child can break a marriage down. I suppose I am biased, I have suffered several miscarriages and infertility. Unless you have experienced that pain, it is just indescribable. It rips you apart. As a woman, it makes you feel (in my case anyway) inadequate.

The pain, the relief, the stress and anxiety the three of them are going through.Also, we can see how different characters dealing with the situation (and there are even conflicts between the different dealings) - the father needs closeness and is not ready yet to take out the baby's items. It seemed to me that the mother dealt with it differently and also her mother thought that she should go to court in order to move on (which would not give her any real compensation as there is no compensation to what she went through).All the little details adds a lot to this movie. I remember in her mother's house, when she walked from room to room, existing in her own world, words like ""dad"" and ""baby"" bounced her heart.I also liked the apples element in the movie. It seemed to me that it consciously or unconsciously represented her process of healing.",Pieces of a Woman

340,chapulia,It really portraits the grief of Women that lost a child,8,9 January 2021,"I know a few women that had lost a child and suffered depression. Kirby portraits that beautifully. For many of the viewers this may seen as dramatic and dysfunctional, but it's too close to reality. Really amazing performance.",Pieces of a Woman

344,a-selwyn-619-976678,Beautifully intimate acting,8,13 January 2021,"For me its enough to watch the two leads unravel in their own way, its quite a simplistic narrative but the depth of character from Labeouf made it all worthwhile watch for me.
I found the volatility in his performance really worked and made me feel deeply for both characters.",Pieces of a Woman
345,villem22,Great performances!,9,14 February 2021,I don't know why this movie has so many bad ratings and reviews. The depiction of their life after a tragedy was very raw and quite emotional. I cried a few times throughout the movie. The acting was great. Definitely worth watching.,Pieces of a Woman
346,velascofamily0805,Starts great and leaves you confused at the end,1,14 January 2021,The storyline fell apart after the loss of their child. Like where did the husband go and why didn't he return. When did she have a seven yr old child with no inkling that so many years have past or is this the child that supposedly die and they wanted the father out of the picture! Either way it sucked. Losing a child is the worst pain a person could ever feel. I wish they would of played up to the storyline at lot better.,Pieces of a Woman
347,ARCADEOFDREAMS,INCREDIBLE!,10,9 January 2021,"The acting is something to behold, the score so subtle yet so powerful. The writing near perfect and the floating seamless cinematography all come together to create a moving experience. This movie had me celebrating, in tears and in awe. Please check this movie out if you haven't. It is one of the best movies of 2020!",Pieces of a Woman
348,pold_6,Ummm... Watch Hillbilly elegy instead,6,8 January 2021,"Worth watching for the superb performances from Vanessa Kirby, Shia LaBeouf (can we say his name?) and Ellen Burstyn as always! A totally gripping opening 30 minutes, you can't help but feel totally immersed and feel all the emotions coming from each character. The story after that takes a nose dive, the characters don't seem to naturally flow through the story but forcibly make decisions out of character to suit the stories narrative. Does little to bring joy or life back into the film until the last final moments, however, by then it doesn't seem like much matters. I'm glad we got to see Martha's character beat her battle, and find some peace and joy. I guess Sean just ODed in Seattle? Who cares right?
There was a missed opportunity to tell a good story here.",Pieces of a Woman
349,courtney-basham,Unbelievably perfect acting,10,10 January 2021,This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It is loosely based on a real-life case of a midwife who was charged with manslaughter after a baby died during a home birth. The emotions and acting in this movie we're spot on. Kirby and LeBeouf were absolutely amazing!! I disagree with some reviews about the movie lagging after the first 30 minutes. Yes the first part of the movie was just heart wrenching and jaw dropping but the remainder of the film is telling a story and it feels real. Wonderful work!,Pieces of a Woman
350,gzarasara,Hardly worth watching,6,17 June 2021,Cinematography and acting were remarkable but not enough to give the poor story any substance unfortunately.I don't know if it's possible to see any value in this movie unless you've gone through childbirth. I personally could not attach to any of the charachters and the film felt like it could be over within the first 30 minutes.,Pieces of a Woman
351,ugurcanakbulat,wrong information about the bridge,7,10 January 2021,"The Man giving wrong info to the lawyer about the bridge.
The Bosphorus Bridge known officially as the 15 July Martyrs Bridge and unofficially as the First Bridge, is one of the three suspension bridges spanning the Bosphorus strait in Istanbul, Turkey, thus connecting Europe and Asia (alongside Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge and Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge). The bridge extends between Ortakoy (in Europe) and Beylerbeyi (in Asia).It is a gravity-anchored suspension bridge with steel towers and inclined hangers.The aerodynamic deck hangs on steel cables. It is 1,560 m (5,118 ft) long with a deck width of 33.40 m (110 ft).The distance between the towers (main span) is 1,074 m (3,524 ft) and the total height of the towers is 165 m (541 ft). The clearance of the bridge from sea level is 64 m (210 ft).Upon its completion in 1973, the Bosphorus Bridge had the fourth-longest suspension bridge span in the world, and the longest outside the United States (only the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, Golden Gate Bridge and Mackinac Bridge had a longer span in 1973). The Bosphorus Bridge remained the longest suspension bridge in Europe until the completion of the Humber Bridge in 1981, and the longest suspension bridge in Asia until the completion of the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge (Second Bosphorus Bridge) in 1988 (which was surpassed by the Minami Bisan-Seto Bridge in 1989). Currently, the Bosphorus Bridge has the 33rd-longest suspension bridge span in the world.",Pieces of a Woman
352,suetrio,Question about age?,5,31 March 2021,"All i kept thinking throughout movie is that Ellen Burstyn is 88 and Vanessa Kirby is 32. That would mean she gave birth to her at 56.

354,twizthewiz,"Vanessa Kirby shines in the emotionally draining ""Pieces of a Woman""",9,21 September 2020,"""Pieces of a Woman"" has remarkable cinematography, including an almost 30 minute ""oner"" shot that has your immediate attention. The dialogue in the film is so crisp and realistic and it comes as no surprise to me that it was first a stage play. The cast is an incredible ensemble, some of Shia LaBeouf's best work, but it is Vanessa Kirby who truly shines in her performance. Surely this has to be a Best Actress contender. Topping it all off with a hauntingly beautiful score from the great Howard Shore.This film is certain to polarize audiences and while I personally recommend ""Pieces of a Woman"", I also caution potential viewers with a warning: the film's subject matter and overall tone are emotionally triggering. I was deeply affected by this film. It's heavy, it's draining and, at times, frustrating. And yet, I'll be thinking about it for a long time.",Pieces of a Woman

356,fallsergirl,Oscar worthy performance s,10,15 January 2021,I really liked this movie. I thought Vanessa Kirby was outstanding and Ellen Burstyn was wonderful. Both desserve Oscars. I liked how the river ice portrayed the fracturing of the couple's relationship as the pieces of ice washed away with the dissolution of them. very good. I recommend this movie.,Pieces of a Woman

358,lisettesmit,Great but for US audience,7,22 January 2021,"I absolutely loved the great acted and dramatic start of this movie. I just didn't understand the fact that the midwife was accused of manslaughter etc. But then I realized that it is not common to have a home delivery in the US. Here, in the Netherlands it is standard to have a home delivery unless there are medical complications during pregnancy. Therefore, for me it was hard to imagine that a midwife would be accused of some thing like this and it felt overdramatic. Losing a baby must be painful enough, having to go to trial must be just heartbreaking..
Vanessa Kirby was great, so was Shia. I just couldn't understand why her mum loathed him?",Pieces of a Woman

361,btoke,Absoluttely realistic,10,8 January 2021,"I have to say that I find this movie realy realistic. Absoluttely amazingly good. The script, direction and cinematography is Perfect and supports the topic of loosing a child and dealing with sorrow in a way I was really blown away by. I could talk so long about details and specific scenes in this movie. It all comes together I think.
Yes. I'm sorry to say but I lost my son 2 year's ago.",Pieces of a Woman
362,tejmummy,Extremely well done.,10,9 January 2021,"I lost my child in 2007 just before she was born and I watched this wondering would it be portrayed sympathetically. It was. The birth scene is part of the story but it is the fall out from the loss. The grief is soul destroying and it changes lives. Me and my partner are not the same people we were before our daughter was born. Both leads play this beautifully, the self destruction is honest. I know people struggle with the ending but sometimes life evolves and becomes 'normal' again. We've had 2 Rainbow babies since our loss. The apple theme is true and accurately portrayed.",Pieces of a Woman

And than the metaphore of the apple. Still don't get it. Is is like the apple of adam and eve, that martha was punished for her bad decision for having homebirth? But still the attraction of growing apples...dont know.

365,celalcelasun,Suspension Bridge resonance goof,7,8 January 2021,"Sean talks about a suspension bridge built around 1940's (Tacoma Narrows Bridge, Washington State) that was collapsed because of resonance, looking at the oil on canvas painting of a suspension bridge and a mosque on the wall at the office of the prosecutor attorney.In fact the painting is the view of the Bosphorus Bridge (renamed 15 Temmuz Sehitler Köprüsü after the coup attempt) which entered service in the year1973 at Istanbul Türkiye, connecting two continents;
Europe and Asia.The view of the painting is from an angle close to Ortaköy where you can see the Mecidiye Mosque on the European side, you can also see the giant flag of Turkish Republic on the Nakkastepe Hill at the Asian side of the city.The filmmakers could have ask an American artist to make a nice painting of the Tacoma bridge.",Pieces of a Woman
