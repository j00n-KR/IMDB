0,TheLittleSongbird,Shooting and sight-seeing in Bruges,8,11 February 2018,"What drove me to seeing 'In Bruges' in the first place was primarily great actors like Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes, and also for the concept and Bruges itself. 'In Bruges' is definitely not for all tastes, one can say that for a lot of films but 'In Bruges' is one of the more extreme examples. It is very foul mouthed with an extreme profanity laden script, is very uncompromisingly violent and its political incorrectness will put the easily offended and the faint hearted off. Three reasons not to see it if all this bothers you. It didn't bother me much though (having seen plenty of films with those approaches that still manage to be great). Neither did on the most part the ridiculousness that 'In Bruges' has been criticised for.What is meant by ""on the most part""? 'In Bruges' weakest element, from a storytelling standpoint and for the film in general, is the ending. This to me was the only part of the film that went over the top on the ridiculousness to overblown proportions, and it just felt contrived and running out of ideas in feel. Carter Burwell's music score is a well written and quite lovely one on its own. Within the film and its mood though, it didn't fit however and juxtaposes too much in terms of tone.However, the performances are very good, excellent in the case of Gleeson (as always) and Fiennes having tons of fun as his sinister character. Wasn't expecting acting this good from Farrell, this is the best he's ever been and he is successful in providing an interesting character that was intended to be morally complex and not likeable. It's the relationship between Farrell and Gleeson that drives the story and drama, it was essential to the film's success and manages to be entertaining, affecting and thought-provoking,Photography is both gritty and beautiful, with a clear sense of style and atmosphere. Bruges not just looks wonderful, it also is treated like a character of its own quite rightly.Similarly successful is the script, which is surprisingly intelligent with a strong balance with thought-provoking philosophical musings, very funny black comedy and character moral complexity (not making the characters likeable but it was clear early on that the intent was for them never to be so) . The story absorbs and entertains, with the brutal holds no prisoners violence not feeling gratuitous, the central relationship being beautifully written and the despair and redemptions themes being surprisingly poignant.Overall, very good if understandably polarising. 8/10 Bethany Cox",In Bruges
1,Leofwine_draca,Quirky hit-man outing,6,27 February 2011,"At first, I wasn't sure what to make of this small-scale crime thriller that follows the exploits of a couple of hit men hiding out in a European city after a job gone wrong. The profane script recalls Guy Ritchie, not in a particularly good way, and the characters are difficult to warm to. The tone is quite uneven, with black comedy being the order of the day as the script sees the characters ruminating on bizarre characters and occurrences, such as when they become involved with a dwarf actor currently staying in the city. I was tempted to switch off during the first half. Then the narrative becomes to be more focused and the second half becomes a lot more entertaining. I found myself warming to both of the leads (a given with the reliable Gleeson, but a surprise as Colin Farrell isn't a favourite of mine) as their humanity becomes evident, and things build up to a thrilling, eventful climax that never disappoints.The on-screen antics are small scale but the acting strong and the pacing spot on. Ralph Fiennes contributes an extended cameo as the duo's violent employee and uses it as a showcase for some over-the-top ranting and humorous scenes. I enjoyed the sense of darkness that pervaded the film, particularly as the ending grows near, and while it's not a favourite, I did find this a solidly enjoyable outing that's more original than most.",In Bruges
2,SnoopyStyle,funny black comedy,8,31 December 2015,"London hit men Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are sent to Bruges, Belgium to hid out by their boss Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes). Ray had accidentally killed an innocent child. Ken takes in the sights but Ray would rather drink and go home. They encounter a film crew with a racist midget and Ray falls for Chloe Villette (Clémence Poésy). Ken is conflicted after Harry contacts him with the new orders.It's funny and dark. Martin McDonagh has filled his film with a black comedic tone. Farrell fills it with his fidgety energy and troubled humanity. He's also hilarious delivering McDonagh's sharp insane dialog. One is never sure if Farrell is going to say something funny or hit somebody over the head or both. Gleeson provides the solid foundation.",In Bruges
3,boblipton,The Profundity of Banality vs. the Banality of Profundity,4,10 February 2008,"It has been my lot in life to know -- at least to the extent of taking part in conversations with -- three and a half hit men: two definitely and three who might have been killers for hire. None of them were possessed, so far as I could judge, of any great sense of moral angst, existential anguish or philosophic underpinnings to their professions, even to the extent of the 'Get 'er Done' attitude of Larry the Cable Guy. Instead they struck me as thugs who were at times gigglingly happy that people would pay them money for something they gladly did for any or no reason whatsoever. One of them was reputed to have killed his own mother by bashing her head repeatedly against a radiator -- perhaps she was not the most lovable of women. The others struck me as not much more entertaining, despite the fascinating lines of white powder they put on the table for the use of the ladies. None were possessed of the ability to quote Apocrypha at length, discourse on the shmoo or hew to moral precepts at appropriate moments. Indeed, the most accurate depiction of the type may have been Alan Ladd's turn in THIS GUN FOR HIRE: asked how he felt when he kills someone, he replies fiercely and blankly ""I feel fine."" I mention this at the start because IN BRUGES accepts at face value certain assumptions that have become rampant since Quentin Tarrantino got PULP FICTION released. In this movie we have what could have been a black comedy, except that only Ralph Fiennes and Peter Dinklage seem to think it is one. Colin Farrell plays a character similar to his recent turn in CASSANDRA'S DREAM, except that he shows his range by assuming an Irish accent, and Brendan Gleeson adds some weight -- no pun intended -- and kills any comedy by his serious and excellent acting. Bruges is very photogenic in obvious ways -- the only other time I have seen this city in a movie was one of Leonce Perret's endless tableaux epics about lace makers filmed about 95 years ago.The net result is a movie that you enjoy when you are watching it, until you go outside and think about it. All of them wind up dead? Good to hear. Except that in the real world, they don't.It would be all too easy to accept this as a great picture based on its track record: a fine cast, a writer-director who just won an Oscar for best short subject, excellent cinematography and so on. But looking at the heart of it, you should see its intellectual and artistic laziness, its acceptance of false assumptions because they enable the creator to gloss over its vacuity with fine words. But it does not use its assumptions to challenge us in any way, except to try to convince us that vicious, uncaring murderers are people just like you and me. Well, they aren't like me, and I know the difference. I hope that you do too.",In Bruges
4,claudio_carvalho,British Dark Humor at Best,7,28 December 2008,"The Irish hit-men Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) are sent by the Londoner mobster Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes) to Bruges, a medieval Belgium city, in Christmas after an awry job in London. Ray, in his first assignment, was sent to murder a priest (Ciarán Hinds) in a church, and he accidentally shot also a boy on the head. While Ken enjoys the historic city, Ray, who is in inner conflict due to the death of the boy, feels completely bored and misses his home town. Ray meets the smalltime drug-dealer and crook Chloë (Clémence Poésy), who sells drug to the cast and crew of a movie that is being filmed in Bruges, and has an incident with a Canadian tourist and later with Chloë's boyfriend. Meanwhile Harry, who has an stringent code of principles, orders Ken to kill his protégée and friend Ray.""In Bruges"" is a dramatic and violent comedy with the famous British dark humor at best. The flawed characters are charismatic and weird: two hit-men, one of them living an existential crisis; a mobster kingpin with a code of principles; a drug-dealer; an American dwarf star of an Euro-trash movie; a clumsy crook; a stressed Canadian tourist are the lead components of this sarcastic story, associated to witty dialogs, with many jokes and irony, and unusual situations. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Na Mira do Chefe"" (""In the Aim of the Boss"")Note: On August 2013, I visited the lovely Bruges and I agree with Ken: it is a beautiful town. On 08 September 2013, I saw this movie again.",In Bruges
5,classicsoncall,"""Why would anyone have to go to Belgium?""",8,27 February 2018,"Not your typical assassination flick, as the film combines elements of ruthless violence and squeamish humor side by side. The character of Jimmy the dwarf (Jordan Prentice) was a nice touch to provide all that conversation about midgets committing suicide, a topic apparently that hit-man Ray (Colin Farrell) couldn't get enough of. For a couple of assassins, Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray displayed a lot of honor and integrity in the way they conducted themselves. They must have taken their cue from boss man Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes), who honorably killed himself at the end of the picture when he wound up shooting Jimmy by accident. I would have expected nothing less, although to be accurate, Jimmy wasn't a kid, so Harry would have had some leeway there. I'd have to assume Ray made it back to London at some point, seeing as how his narration closed out the picture, but the ending could just as easily be left up to the imagination of the viewer. I'm pretty sure he made it myself though, with a return trip to Bruges in his future for some more culture and fun.",In Bruges
6,gavin6942,English Mafia Films.. Here's Another Good One,7,26 April 2010,"After a botched hit job on a priest, two hit men are sent to ""hide out"" in Bruges (that's Belgium) until they receive further instructions. However, when those instructions arrive, it's not the happy ending they may have been hoping for.""In Bruges"" is pretty much awesome. It has the English mafia mentality of Guy Ritchie's work, with a fair amount of action and violence, but it also has a sentimental side that Ritchie doesn't really touch upon in his tales. These are men who not only kill, but can love... and have their own moral code of right and wrong.Colin Farrell shines here. If he never did anything else, he could still be remembered for this film (he's also decent in ""Dr. Parnassus""). And then you have Ralph Fiennes, who pretty much never makes a bad film, even when it's a sappy romantic comedy. More than any other role, Harry (Fiennes) brings out the anger and the control.This film is ""Snatch"" brought to the next level with some of ""The Third Man"" thrown in. A few unpredictable twists and turns, and some lively characters that are unique in more ways than one. I highly recommend this film for anyone.",In Bruges
7,lee_eisenberg,ringing the Belgium,7,12 July 2008,"Prior to seeing Martin McDonagh's ""In Bruges"", I had heard that it was a straightforward comedy. It turned out that while the movie starts out comedic, it gets more serious as it progresses. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson play hit men Ray and Ken, respectively. After Ray accidentally kills a boy, head honcho Harry (Ralph Fiennes) sends Ray and Ken to Bruges, Belgium. This is the sort of city that by rights should attract just about every tourist; certainly Ken spends as much time as possible sightseeing. Ray, however, can't get over his previous actions, and his short temper gets him into trouble everywhere.Two wrenches get thrown into the works when Ray strikes up a relationship with local drug dealer Chloe (Clemence Poesy) and Harry orders Ken to kill Ray. The events resulting from the second part really set the movie on its more serious course.I guess that the movie disappointed me a little in that it turned out not to be the comedy that I expected. But for the most part I liked how it posed the question of what is right in such a convoluted situation and lets the audience decide for themselves (sort of like what ""No Country for Old Men"" does). Worth seeing, if not the best movie. And if I may say so, Jimmy's (Jordan Prentice) description of the race war sounded like what Charles Manson envisioned.Also starring Elizabeth Berrington, Anna Madeley, Thekla Reuten, Ciaran Hinds, Rudy Blomme, Mark Donovan, Ann Elsley and Jean-Marc Favorin.",In Bruges
8,jboothmillard,In Bruges,7,6 September 2010,"I had heard a little about this film when it was out in cinemas, certainly the leading actor, so I was quite keen to give it a try when I had the chance to see it. Basically Irish hit men Ray (Golden Globe winning Colin Farrell) and Ken (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Brendan Gleeson) are sent by Londoner and mobster Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes) to lie low after a job in a London church went wrong. Ray was supposed to kill the priest of the church for a hit, and he accidentally kills a child with the same bullet, and he has had nightmares about it since. They have been sent to lie low in Bruges, Belgium, during the Christmas holiday, and while Ray is bored and missing home, Ken is wanting to enjoy the things to do and see. Ray has his bored attitude changed when he meets drug dealing crook Chloë Villette (Clémence Poésy) who is dealing during a movie being filmed, starring American dwarf actor Jimmy (American Pie Presents The Naked Mile's Jordan Prentice). Harry calls with instructions for their hit, but Ken refuses forcing the mobster to come to Bruges to settle the score and have a showdown in the Belgian square in the area. In the end, after seeing Ken fall to his death and speak his last words, and a gun to give him, Ray kills Harry, and once again unintentionally a small person, Jimmy. Also starring Jérémie Renier as Eirik, Elizabeth Berrington as Natalie and Eric Godon as Yuri. Farrell, with his unusually large eye brows, and Gleeson with his Irish prowess, and the always reliable Fiennes putting on a lighter than usual voice make a good cast. It may be a little politically incorrect in parts, it even shocks you with the death of the child, but some humorous moments and a witty script, it does do well as a black comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Editing and Outstanding British Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. Very good!",In Bruges
9,rmax304823,A Tour You Can Learn From.,8,13 May 2009,"What a splendidly executed dramatic comedy about two Irish hit men wandering around the ancient city of Bruges, Belgium. Everything seems to come together, everything synchronized, and the chief credit must go to the writer and director, Martin McDonagh, with myriad plaudits left over for the actors, the photographer, the typically insinuating score by Carter Burwell, and all the other elements of the film.Colin Farrell is a hit man in London. On his first assignment from boss Ralph Fiennes, he shoots a priest and, accidentally, a little boy waiting to make his confession. The guilt haunts him although, aside from the occasional act of putting a pistol to his head and cocking it, it doesn't otherwise seem to interfere with his enjoyment of life.Farrell and another murderer, the plump but perceptive Brendan Gleeson, are sent to Bruges to await a phone call from Fiennes identifying their next target. While sitting around, instead of twiddling their thumbs, they visit the medieval Old City at Gleeson's insistence. Farrell is nervous and impatient, while Gleeson is enthralled by the cathedrals, the canal, and ""The Last Judgment,"" a triptych by Heironymous Bosch. It prompts Farrell to observe that Bruges itself might serve as a proper Hell.In fact, it just about does. Gleeson finally receives the long-awaited call from Fiennes, who inquires about Farrell's appreciation of Bruges. Did he visit the cathedral? Yes. Did he see all the paintings? Yes. The canal? Yes, but Gleeson doesn't think that's Farrell's ""thing."" Did he see the swans? Are the swans still there? Yes. (Long pause on the phone.) ""Well then what does he ****ing mean, it's not his ****ing thing?"" Fiennes has sent the two of them there intending this trip to be a last present to Farrell, whom Gleeson must now kill for having murdered that young boy, a violation of principle which must be atoned for. In the end, Gleeson refuses. Fiennes himself comes to Bruges to straighten things out and there is a violent climax.The brutality is as gory and realistic as the comedy is funny. The dialog sparkles, and there were some lines and some conversational exchanges that made me laugh out loud. The characters are quirky and interesting in themselves. Farrell gets wildly excited when he sees a movie crew filming a scene with a dwarf. ""There filming MIDGETS!"" he exclaims, running to the shoot.This is pretty dangerous territory for a movie, when you get right down to it. You know -- whimsy involving idiosyncratic hit men, a pregnant concierge, a dwarf who complains about how much **** he's had to take from black midgets, cocaine, a Russian arms dealer who wonders if he's using the right word when he talks about ""alcoves"", a beautiful young woman who supplies film crews with dope. It's the kind of story that could easily try to coast along on its phantasmic charm. But the plot is strong enough to hold in one channel the divagations into saintly relics and restaurant fist fights with Americans who complain about Europeans blowing cigarette smoke in their direction. That last incident, the one about smoking in a restaurant, is emblematic of the entire film. It's a misunderstanding, and a bloody one. The impulsive Farrell decks the American, Zeljko Ivanek, saying, ""That's for John Lennon, you ****,"" only to discover later that the American was a Canadian and that he, Farrell, had made another violent error.Well, I guess I won't go on about it although, to be sure, we're talking about more than just two murderers taking a vacation in Belgium. There are religious undertones -- or, more generally, moral ones -- galore. The logic doesn't always maintain its integrity. (Eg., Farrell is supposed to be eliminated because he accidentally killed a little boy -- but whacking the priest during confession was okay?)I'm not so sure that kids would either understand it or enjoy it but see it when you get a chance.",In Bruges
10,Tweekums,Laughter and tears in Bruges,10,7 January 2010,"The idea of a film about a couple of foul-mouthed Irish hit men laying low in Bruges after one of them has accidentally killed a child in a church doesn't sound like a barrel of laughs but there are plenty of laugh out loud moments in this black comedy.The two men are Ken, the older of the two who loves the culture and history in the ancient town and Ray who thinks two weeks stuck in Bruges is like purgatory. Ray is having difficulty coming to terms with the fact that he killed a child to such an extent that he is contemplating suicide... he might not have to do it however as Ken gets a call from Harry, their employer, telling him he is to kill Ray. Of course nothing goes quite as expected, Ray falls in love with a local con-woman and ends up dealing with her less than competent ex-boyfriend who threatens him with a revolver, a dwarf who has some strange views about race when on drugs and some large American tourists who don't like being told they are too big to go up a church tower.The Martin McDonagh wrote a great script the brilliantly directed a cast of talented actors; Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell were great as Ken and Ray, they are able supported by Clémence Poésy as Ray's new girlfriend Chloe, Thekla Reuten as pregnant hotel owner Marie and Ralph Fiennes as the two killers' employer who had a strict rule about never hurting a child.If you are offended by swearing give this film a wide birth as it contains almost non-stop bad language, it also contains some bloody violence that might bother some viewers, however if these things don't bother you then I'd strongly recommend this, a laughed out loud many times and won't deny that I also shed a few tears.",In Bruges
11,blanche-2,A new place for purgatory,8,8 May 2012,"Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleason are ""In Bruges,"" a 2008 film directed by Martin McDonagh.Farrell and Gleason are Ray and Ken, two hit men sent to Bruges, Belgium to await instructions on their next hit from their boss Yuri (Ralph Fiennes). Ken (Gleason) loves the fairytale prettiness and medieval sites of the town, but Farrell, a volatile and troubled young man, is bored out of his mind. He perks up a little when he meets a pretty drug dealer and makes a date with her. It gets to be kind of messy, though, when he takes offense at the restaurant and beats up a fellow patron, and then at her place, her boyfriend.Ken is at the hotel to receive the call on the next hit, and it's on Ray. The boss was trying to show him a nice time in a pretty place before he dies. The reason? On his first hit, which was in a church on a priest, one of Farrell's bullets hit a child. Not only can't Farrell recover from it, but Fiennes wants him gone.Though this is a dark film, it has a great deal of humor, mostly provided by Farrell's excellent performance as the reckless Ray. The director, McDonagh, has skillfully enmeshed both the comedy and the drama together and woven the idea of heaven, hell, and purgatory into the story. For Ken, Bruges is his idea of heaven, peaceful and beautiful. For Ray, since they're stuck there for two weeks, it's purgatory.""In Bruges"" is a beautiful film about guilt, camaraderie, and the possibility of redemption. It's depressing but not completely. And the scenery, despite what Ray thinks, is beautiful.",In Bruges
12,Quinoa1984,melancholy drama-comedy of career criminals in moral jeopardy,9,9 March 2008,"Playwright McDonaugh's debut feature, In Bruges, works only up to a point as a crime comedy (however considering up to what point is quite remarkable), featuring a supporting cast ranging from quirky Euro-trash and plain old jolly eccentrics. But as a moral drama, it's almost as top of the pops one could ask for. The trailer didn't make it seem as such, then again it is hard to express the kind of conundrum that the main characters get themselves into while also appealing to a base of fans that love quip-type one liners (i.e. ""You're a bunch of bleeping elephants!"" or ""If I was retarded, or grew up on a farm, Bruges would impress me, but I didn't, so I'm not impressed."") When In Bruges is at its best- and until its self-consciously symbolic touches in the last five minutes it usually is at its ""Best"" whatever that means- it expresses what I love seeing in films about career criminals: the total inner turmoil of what was done coming back to haunt the person. If it's true that no good deed goes unpunished, the same would probably go for bad deeds in the world of In Bruges, where the atmosphere of the practically medieval city is, the character Ken observes, like ""a fairytale"", and a sharp contrast to the dark side pervading Ken, Ray, and Harry.The basic thrust of the plot is that Ray (half wise-ass womanizer and half half-suicidal played by Farrell) did a job back in London, a murder, which went horribly wrong in just one misstep (I won't reveal it here, though I should, except to say that it's one of those cardinal rules career criminals/hit men have to stick to), and so he and the older, less cynical Ken (Gleeson, who seems to be one of the most honest looking types in the character actor world, a spot-on casting choice), are sent to Bruges to receive more instructions. But those instructions, sent by the easily angered Harry (Ralph Fiennes, doing almost a hilarious imitation of Kingskey in Sexy Beast), aren't followed through, and then some manner of chaos ensues.Here and there McDonaugh takes what appears to be a lackadaisical attitude to the characters in this otherwise tense and uncertain fatalistic situation, as if an odd-matched comic duo are in a place one likes and one only can stand for mocking midgets (scuse me, dwarfs) in movie-making and hitting on the one hot girl in all of Bruges. But it's such a strange form that McDonaugh is working with here, with its mix of tones that it suddenly feels, in the context of the slightly bizarre and chilling circumstances, truthful. It goes without saying the cast helps give the material a boost, and that McDonaugh doesn't throw too many out-of-left-field curve balls with the plot. If he does, it's not of the sort we know we're usually hitting in this kind of crime story loaded with gallows humor and Catholic redemption mini-saga.In short, if I were a bloke in Britain or a fella in Dublin, or a dupe in Bruges, as a writer this is the kind of stuff I'd immediately try to go for. It's smart, serious, mature genre work that relies on just enough blood-shed and violence and trauma to haunt its audience proper, and do its duty to supply another batch of wonderfully off-kilter 'comedy' scenes for fans of British gangster flicks. That this is nowhere near as shallow as a Ritchie pic goes without saying.",In Bruges

15,hitchcockthelegend,In a fairytale city with a couple of foul mouthed hit men.,9,16 May 2010,"Ray (Colin Farrell) & Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are two Irish hit men who are sent to lay low in the beautiful city of Bruges by their gangster boss Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes). As they wait for instruction from Harry the pair start to address many things that are troubling them, with one pressing matter particularly relevant to their lives post the Bruges visit.Written and directed by Martin McDonagh, a man more known for his play writing abilities, In Bruges is a rare old animal indeed. Not only is it a winner in the very wobbly sub-genre that encompasses the British gangster movie, it's also a hugely funny and tasteless button pusher to boot. From the outset the film sets itself up to not be to everybody's cup of tea. As Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson exchange expletive after expletive whilst surrounded by the considerable beauty of Bruges, it's obvious this is not going to be a ""normal"" movie. Throw in drug abuse, prostitution and a racist dwarf, well you can understand why the film is seen as unpalatable to some - yet still be digestible brilliance to others. What is for sure is that those who haven't seen it really should do so for it may just become one of your favourite movies, yes, it really does deserve the chance to pull you on board.By definition, it's an ultimate black comedy, But in amongst the laughs, and there are many, lies a potent and affecting human drama involving love, guilt, morals and redemption. With the trick pulled by McDonagh being that of having every character in the piece dislikable, and yet easy to be on side with. Don't be surprised if you find yourself welling up with emotion during some of the more critical scenes. For the screenplay (BAFTA Award Winning) and the performances of Farrell (Golden Globe Award Best Actor) & Gleeson are razor sharp and very involving. Even Fiennes' spiv gangster boss is shown to be a ruthless sweary anger merchant, yet still capable of apology and genuinely respective of good principals. If that sounds odd? Then good, because it's an odd and strange little movie. I mean the love interest comes in the form of pretty Clémence Poésy, a criminal femme fatale type here, but once ""Fleur Delacour"" in ""Harry Potter"" & ""The Goblet Of Fire"". While Canadian dwarf actor Jordan Prentice is more well known for playing ""Howard The Duck"". Each of them serving genuine purpose, both for the funny side of the story, and for the more humanistic elements that unravel as we hurtle towards to the coup de grâce a like finale.A barbed wire black comedy led by a towering performance from Farrell - where just like him you should laugh, cry and swear to your hearts content. 9/10",In Bruges
16,jotix100,Our men in Bruges,9,13 November 2009,"Ken an Ray, two Irish hit men, are seen arriving in Bruges, Belgium. The have been told to go to that city after a job had gone badly back in Ireland. Their boss, Harry, figures the medieval city will be perfect to get this duo away from all the commotion the crime has caused back home. Ray, doing his first job has to get rid of a priest. In doing so, he also kills an innocent child on his way to confession. The mere idea in killing a minor is something so repugnant, that even the criminal boss is horrified.Harry remembering fondly the time he visited that lovely old city, decides to send the two men there. Ken, who is older, and wiser, decides to take it easy and tries to discover the hidden treasures of Bruges, while Ray, a much younger and inexperienced man thinks the city stinks, literally. Having them share a room is too much for Ray. Ken, on the other hand, doesn't appreciate his babysitting job, knowing his younger partner is a loose cannon.Ray discovers the gorgeous Chloe that appears to be working in a movie being shot in the city. Ray wants to have fun, finding that Chloe is game for whatever. As they are getting comfortable at her place, her boyfriend Eirik, arrives wielding a gun and pointing it to Ray, who is able to get it from him. Little did he know it had blank bullets. In the struggle Ray fires a shot wounding Eirik in one eye.Ken receives an urgent message from Harry, he must eliminate Ray. Ken is not mentally prepared to execute what Harry wants from him. In fact, when he finds the proper time to do it, he changes his mind ans asks Ray to go away and try to stay away from Ireland and England, but as fate has it, Ray is found out by the police because of a violent encounter with a Canadian tourist at a restaurant.Harry decides he cannot trust Ken. He shows up in Bruges to take care of business. The confrontation has Harry and Ken going to a tower that faces the main square. What happens next will surprise us because of the way things develop. The ending parallels what happened to Ray when he killed the boy by accident. In this instance Harry proves he might be a criminal also, but one with scruples.""In Bruges"" is a fine film by playwright turned director Martin McDonagh, whose ""Leenanne Trilogy"", ""The Liutenant of Inishmore"" and other plays have delighted theater goers in the last decade, decided to work on an original story that he magnificently sets in the gorgeous, and touristy city of Bruges, Belgium. Mr. McDonagh shows why he is one of the best writers working these days. With this debut he makes probably the impossible task of making a film that everybody will use as a base of comparison against his future films.The cast is first rate. Brendan Gleeson, the star of his short film, ""Six Shooter"" was born to play Ken, the older criminal that has seen a lot during his hard life in that world. This actor clearly shows why he is one of the best character actors around. Equally surprising is Colin Farrell. This actor brings an intensity to his Ray, the ambitious young man who made a mistake in misjudging the way he was to eliminate an enemy and has to pay dearly for it. Ralph Fiennes gives one of the best performances of his career as the crime boss with a conscience. His presence in the film is based on a raw energy we just didn't expect.The supporting cast is excellent. Clemence Poesy is the beautiful Chloe, the woman that catches Ray's eye. Jeremie Renier, the wonderful Belgian actor has a small part as the skinhead Eirik. Thekla Reuten appears as the pregnant hotel owner. Zeljko Ivanek has a small, but important part as the offended tourist that protest about smoking in a restaurant. Jordan Prentice is Jimmy, the dwarf actor working in the film that is being shot and becomes friendly with Ray.The film is photographed lovingly by Eigil Bryld. He takes us through the magical city of Bruges to witness the action, never making the mistake of making it a travelogue. Carter Burwell's fine musical score contributes to our enjoyment of the film. Credit must go to the director for bringing all the elements together in this amazing production.",In Bruges
17,Hey_Sweden,"Funny, poignant, genuinely interesting.",7,28 December 2012,"Playwright Martin McDonagh makes an assured feature filmmaking debut with this witty and generally amusing combination of dark comedy, sobering drama, crime picture, and travelogue. The Bruges of the title is a Belgian city with a real storybook quality and which is a magnet for the tourist trade. Hit men Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) have been sent there on orders from their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) after a job has been botched and a young boy accidentally killed. They're instructed to take in the sights - which Ken is more than happy to do - while awaiting further orders. But Ray is grumpy and bored and thinks that spending time in Bruges is like spending time in Purgatory. Audiences accustomed to loud and fast action films may possibly find this to be just as dull as Ray finds Bruges, but some may also consider this to be a rather interesting breath of fresh air. It's very dependent on character and situation, and working from McDonaghs' script, the three principal actors do excellent jobs creating well rounded individuals who may be in a morbid line of work but who each have their own moral code. Among the assorted episodes of the story, Ray romances a free spirited local named Chloe (Clemence Poesy), makes the acquaintance of a dwarf named Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), gets briefly menaced by Chloes' associate Eirik (Jeremie Renier), roughs up a loud mouthed Canadian guy (!) portrayed by Zeljko Ivanek, and learns the truth about why he and Ken were sent to Bruges in the first place. McDonaghs' dialogue is sometimes surprising and often quite funny; he gives the material an impressively un-P.C. flair. There are spurts of bloody violence here and there, but what the writer / director often sets out to do is actually subvert the conventions of typical crime gone wrong flicks, even coming up with a way to avoid the kind of shootout one might normally see in this sort of thing. Beautiful photography and scenery are of course a credit to the film; the city does become a character in its own right. The music by Carter Burwell is superb at setting the mood. The three leads are terrific, with Fiennes showing a winning aptitude for comedy, and Farrell and Gleeson definitely managing to win our sympathies. They help to make this nicely offbeat film worth seeking out for movie lovers who get tired of more formulaic fare. Recommended. Seven out of 10.",In Bruges
18,LeonLouisRicci,Drop the Curtain and Move On,7,5 June 2013,"Pretty vulgar, pretty ultra-violent, and some pretty Cinematography are things that are the attraction here. Announcing itself as something Hip and Cutting Edge, it is not. This type of thing used to be unconventional before Scorsese, Tarantino, and the overrated, one-trick Pony, Guy Ritchie.Now, this Movie seems familiar, but yet it is still new enough to gain some attention, and some overpraising. There is some Fun in this that is not without its price. Excessive and redundant at times, it can be an entertaining, if a deficiency of taste is to your liking. This does show that Colin Farrell can be a likable and effective Actor, in fact, the Performers here are all up for this ostentatious offering. It's a crude and funny attempt at something or another about despicable Characters with a ""tender"" side, and the Audience is suppose to believe that there is Beauty, if one looks, everywhere. Even if the surface is Horrifying, like a Painting by Bosch.The ending is the weakest part of this otherwise successful, but rapidly becoming overused, Story and one cannot help but wonder when the curtain will finally drop, because this type of thing is now found itself to be Clichéd.",In Bruges
19,writers_reign,In Dutch,7,11 May 2008,I hope Martin McDonagh is cutting Harold Pinter in for a piece of the gate on this. Not content with ripping-off Pinter's two-hander The Dumb-Waiter (in case you didn't see it that's the one where two hit man are killing time - sorry about that - whilst waiting to learn their next assignment which turns out to be for one to snuff the other) and extending it he also 'borrows' the Pinter style of dialogue. This doesn't make it a bad film but it does make it unoriginal. I don't know what it is with Irish writers and rip-offs: It's not so long since one of them wrote something called Dancing At Lughnasa which featured a dysfunctional family living in the Depression with a son walking out of the action to spout linking narrative and then returning to the action. Nothing wrong with that IF Tennessee Williams hadn't done the same thing years earlier in The Glass Menagerie. Anyway back to Bruges where Colin Farrell is being as un PC as it's possible to be - and I have absolutely no problem with that. If nothing else we get some great scenery and that with the fairly decent acting makes it worth seeing even if McDonagh is only The Caretaker for Pinter.,In Bruges

I spent two years there and visited all the Minoan sites. Of course, all the tourists go to Knossos, and my wife didn't mind that as it is partially reconstructed, but the other four were a real pain to her. One is way on top of a mountain that is accessible only by a one lane dirt road. All the time you are going up, you hope a bus isn't coming down. You finally get there and you see the site as it is - a 5000-year-old, unreconstructed site. In my wife's description, ""We climbed up here to see a pile of rocks!"" It is exactly how Ray (Colin Farrell) felt when sent to Bruges with his partner, Ken (Brendan Gleeson). Ken, like me, of course liked the sites. The banter between the two is priceless. Martin McDonagh not only directed a winner, he wrote some of the best dialog that I have heard in a long time. Imagine a Hugh Grant film with hit men. Well, he did one of those, didn't her, but this was far superior.And, it has Fleur Delacour (Clémence Poésy) in a very un-Harry Potter-like role.

23,evanston_dad,A Movie That Defies Description (In a Good Way),9,9 September 2008,"Writer/director Martin McDonagh has fashioned a little gem of a crime thriller/black comedy with his film, ""In Bruges."" It's quirky and eccentric, but in a way that comes naturally and doesn't feel remotely forced. And despite the running joke about Bruges being such a boring and dull place to be, the movie makes the city itself look lovely.Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) play two hit men who hole up in the titular city awaiting orders from their boss, Harry, played by Ralph Fiennes. Both suffer a crisis of conscience -- Ray because his first hit resulted in his accidentally killing a little boy, Ken because his orders once they come are to bump off Ray, who annoys him but who he rather likes. When Ken tells Harry he refuses to kill Ray, Harry comes after the two men himself, resulting in a quite violent finale.McDonagh's background in theatre shows, especially in his writing. The screenplay to ""In Bruges"" is a marvel, tightly wound and compact. It's fresh and surprising, traits that don't frequently describe movie scripts nowadays. The movie is viciously funny, but the relationship between Ray and Ken is also rather moving, and the violence (and boy is it graphic at times) is very disturbing precisely because we come to care so much about the characters it's happening to.All of the performances, but especially those of Farrell, Gleeson and Fiennes, are superb. McDonagh proves himself to be a good director of actors, and he handles his own material masterfully. He even manages to make midget humor (the stuff of movie comedy clichés) funny again.Grade: A",In Bruges
24,ferguson-6,Plenty of Alcoves in Bruges,9,9 February 2008,"Greetings again from the darkness. Award winning playwright Martin McDonagh brings his amazing writing talents to the big screen and scores with his first turn as a feature film director. The city of Bruges (yes, in Belgium) is the perfect setting for the multi-layered story. Its well preserved medieval architecture is like an character unto itself.Colin Farrell delivers by far his best performance to date. He is funny, dangerous, sexy and emotional throughout. This is exceptional acting from a guy who tends to disappoint. Of course, it helps to have magnificent writing and this one most certainly delivers on that front. The dialogue is quirky and quick ... so tune in early.Strong work also from Brendon Gleeson, who all will recognize from ""Gangs of New York"" and the Harry Potter series. He is a tough guy with a streak of humanity. The third piece of the puzzle is Ralph Fiennes as the mastermind bad guy. The supporting work is fine from Jordan Prentice as the dwarf actor (sadly Mr. Prentice is most famous for playing Howard the Duck) and a very cute Clemence Poesy as Farrell's odd love interest.Very few writers can write dialogue like this and even fewer can juggle as many layers without making a film seem busy, crowded or forced. Hopefully Mr. McDonagh will bring more of his work to the big screen ... he certainly adds a touch of class!",In Bruges
25,gradyharp,The Psychic Isolation of Two Hit Men in Bruges,9,26 June 2008,"Martin McDonagh makes an impressive writing and directing debut with the very fresh and entertaining and surprisingly well rounded film IN BRUGES. Though the basic storyline is rather simple, McDonagh knows how to keep it turning and twisting with generous amounts of humor as well as probing character development. He has assembled a cast of very fine actors, turned the cinematography of the gorgeous Belgian city of Bruges over to the capable creative hands of Eigil Bryld, and finished his project off with a fine musical score by the gifted Carter Burwell (with a nod to Schubert and others): the result is a beautiful little film with messages galore and always a visual treat to see repeatedly. Two hit men - Ken (Brendan Gleeson), a chubby, optimistic bloke who loves spending time with the sights of Bruges, and Ray (Colin Farrell), an emotionally distraught young man in the throes of guilt from a botched 'hit' that accidentally killed a young boy - have been sent by their 'boss' Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to 'lay low' after the botched murder of a priest (Ciarán Hinds). It is Christmas season and there are too few rooms available so Ken and Ray reluctantly share a tiny hotel room to await further orders from Harry. Ken falls in love with the beauty of the city of Bruges while Ray, ever anxious and distrustful, finds some solace in a film being shot about 'midgets' (Jérémie Renie) with behind the scenes girl Chloë (Clémence Poésy). How these two Irish guys make the most of their enforced isolation ultimately leads to the real reason for their assignment, a reason that includes a last 'hit' that sweeps the audience to a surprising ending. McDonagh writes very well, giving some of the best comedic lines to Farrell who proves himself a fine fit for this difficult role. Yes, it is another 'hit man film', but this one has the good fortune to deal with very real people, conflicted with their choice of 'occupation' and who are hungry to share their tenuous lives with good friends. Though there is considerable bloody derring-do, the film uses the chase and kill scenes to good advantage, allowing the audience to feel the human side of those whose job it is to 'off' others. Both Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are superb and their roles are enhanced by a choice selection of character actors who speed the plot along nicely. This is a very entertaining movie, one that can be appreciated on many levels, and one that suggests that Martin McDonagh has a solid future in cinema. Grady Harp",In Bruges
26,zetes,Exceptional!,9,20 July 2008,"This is McDonagh's first feature, and it's a sure bet that he's a writer/director to watch in the future. In Bruges was advertised as a straight comedy featuring gangsters who like to shoot at each other, so the three-dimensional characters and emotional depth come as a nice surprise. Colin Farrell, who, if he hadn't already convinced me he was a great actor, certainly wins that title now, stars as a green hit-man with a short attention span who messes up his first job by killing an innocent bystander. Things seem to be okay with the boss (Ralph Fiennes), who sends Farrell and his partner, Brendan Gleeson, to the beautiful Belgian town of Bruges to wait for their next instructions. The fact is, Fiennes plans for Gleeson to snuff out Farrell. That's the basic set-up, and it would be criminal to reveal too much more. McDonagh's script is a thing of beauty, quick-witted, smart and frequently touching. I did think that the final twists were a bit overly clever. Jordan Prentice, who plays the dwarf Jimmy in the film, began his career as one of several dwarfs inhabiting the Howard the Duck costume in the film of the same name.",In Bruges

Colin Farrell's never been my cup of ea, but I really liked him in this movie; flawed character, cheeky little shìt, he's got great personality. And one of the movie's biggest gifts is making you feel for two leads, a pair of murderous hit men. It's a film full of foul language, prostitutes and a dwarf, and yet it excels at being both sad and rewarding.Sometimes it's a quirky sightseeing tale, others it's a crime movie - but essentially, it's a dark comedy, and a great one.8/10",In Bruges

I loved it that a guy could talk of all his kills then get soppy over some aspect of his life. But what I liked best was the full frontal script and gags that we thought could no longer be told, involving gays, Americans, dwarfs, fatties and much much more. Great stuff.

McDonagh's writing and direction are THE pluses of the film. The screenplay is astounding; the execution is high-class. 'In Bruges' makes you smile, makes you sad, it's a joyride you can't afford to miss.If the writing and direction get all the hoopla, here's a special mention to: Cinematographer Eigil Bryld for doing his work par-excellence. The editing by Jon Gregory is nothing short of perfection.Talking of performances: Colin Farrell has delivered bravura performances in many of his previous works, but his work in'In Bruges' makes him go down as one of the finest actors of all-time. The regret, the pain of killing an innocent kid, you fell the pain he's going through. Calling his performance as fantastic would've been an understatement.

31,Buddy-51,Brooding in Bruges,9,16 February 2009,"One of the outstanding movies of 2008, ""In Bruges"" is that rare cinematic high wire act that manages to juggle any number of seemingly contradictory moods and tones simultaneously without ever once dropping the ball. Alternating between the absurdly funny and the deadly serious, the movie, written and directed by Martin McDonagh, offers a wise, witty and surprisingly touching take on friendship, guilt, redemption and the strange code of ethics that guides the behavior of the professional killer (those who appear in the movies at least).Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleason are superb as Ray and Ken, two British hit men who are sent to Bruges, Belgium to hide out after Ray accidentally kills a young boy in an assassination gone wrong. Stuck in this strange Medieval city, the two men make the best of a bad situation, Ken by taking in the sights and immersing himself in the rich history and culture of the place, Ray by moaning about how bored and homesick he is, all the while trying to work through the guilt of having the blood of an innocent child on his hands.In a screenplay crackling with irony and wit, McDonagh paints the portrait of an unusual friendship between two men who seemingly have little in common beyond their chosen profession and a mutual respect for one another. Ken is mature, well educated, even-tempered and pragmatic, while Ray is unbright, hot-headed, and easily provoked by the words and actions of others. Yet, somewhere beneath his rough-and-tumble, sometimes rather befuddled exterior beats a giving heart and an appreciation for the good that can be found in certain people. Gleason and Farrell give performances of immense sophistication and depth, with Farrell, in particular, creating a fully rounded portrait of a ""loveable"" killer. His body compressed down into a perpetual slump while a host of conflicting emotions flutter across his expressive face, Farrell demonstrates that he has the physicality an actor needs to make a character come to life on screen. In a much smaller role, Ralph Fiennes also makes his mark as the mob boss who has some strange notions about what constitutes morality and honor when it comes to killing.Add to all these various virtues lyrical direction by McDonagh, beautiful cinematography by Eigil Bryld, some colorful minor characters, and architecture guaranteed to knock the viewer's eye out - and you have one of the true movie going pleasures of recent years.",In Bruges

I'm going to guess no, but In Bruges suggests writer/director Martin McDonagh might disagree.In Bruges begins with two guys checking into a hotel in Bruges. They have come to wait an unspecified amount of time to speak to someone. They go sightseeing. One man loves Bruges, the other finds it tedious.This is maybe the first third of the movie, which is sometimes amusing but doesn't give you much to hold onto. Then a flurry of things happen and an elaborate, ingenious story kicks in. And that part involves terrible people being shockingly full of scruples.The film is very well acted and generally amusing with some dark and occasionally suspenseful moments, yet I was never fully drawn in. The ingenuity of the story and moral code of the protagonists felt like dramatic devices rather than something that comes from real life experience. A false clever plot and unlikely characters is not inherently unworkable, and I think the problem is less the script than that McDonagh can't quite figure out how to flesh that script with human complexity (something he successfully did in ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri."")I enjoyed this well enough, but I wouldn't say it's something you should seek out.",In Bruges

Ray was responsible for the hit going wrong, so it's his neck most likely on the line and it doesn't help that while Ken tries to take in the local culture and experience, he sees everything wrong with it. So as they await the call, they must also come to terms with a town where everything seems foreign and weird.Quentin Tarantino's style of crime thriller writing has inspired some notable imitations, one of which would appear to be this well received Europe set film from Martin McDonaugh. Your sense of political correctness can be left well at the door, as jabs at the Chinese, midgets and retards come thick and fast. Other problems though, include it being a rather slow and talky film at times, but it's an undeniably sharp and well written film, which makes it funny and thrilling as well. Performances wise, it's nice to see Farrell back (check out the scene where he talks to the midget and the prostitute, double chin or what???) and there's nice support from Gleeson and Fiennes, ditching his usual well spoken brit thing for a sharp cockney villain dialect. ****",In Bruges
35,ElMaruecan82,"""In Bruges"", get in the mood of one of the most unforgettable cinematic trips ...",10,21 April 2011,"What a fantastic 'little' movie and I mean no disrespect by using the epithetic 'little'. In fact, it's a word that conveys extremely well the charm of this film, set in a small town in Belgium, Bruges, one of the unlikeliest but cleverest settings of a crime film. Even the title couldn't have been more eloquent, since the whole point of the film is that two Irish hit men are basically spending time ""In Bruges"", waiting for their boss' instructions after a botched job. While one of the two protagonists, Brendan Gleeson as the calm and moderate Ken, takes the opportunity to do the most normal thing we would do in a touristic place, his younger partner and friend, Ray, Colin Farrell, more free-spirited and tormented, impatiently thinks of leaving the town.There's a melancholic feeling inhabiting the first part of the film, as if we're waiting for something to happen ""In Bruges"", the action takes its time ... but that didn't bother me at all. The pacing's slowness gives us enough time to follow the characters and understand their personalities, and in the specific case of Ray: the big trauma that tortures his mind, and might have something to do with their 'waiting' in Bruges. And as the film progresses, you realize that Ray's pain reveals another one, even subtler, hidden in Ken's heart. It's a film with an unexpected depth that doesn't distract from the whole comedic atmosphere and reveals what is for me, one of the best written scripts of the last decade. Actually, I still wonder if I saw a black humor comedy or a light-hearted drama, but in both cases, I know I've seen one of the most unconventionally original films which is hard not to review without sounding like a pompous critic.So ... what I loved the most about ""In Bruges"" is this little universe it created, something very distinctive that I can't compare with any other film. A unique atmosphere where tourists, actors, thieves, prostitutes meet together and discuss everyday or futile matters like we do in real-life, when we go visit a foreign place. It's a cinematic melting-pot made of curiosity, discovery and knowledge, creating a supplementary delight while watching the film, as if the town was a character we learn about it, too. And that's how the movie works first, as a comedic medley of all the intriguing and entertaining situations we face while visiting a foreign country, something that gives the impression of an episodic and non-linear story, but the power of the script is that all these situations evolve crescendo and then finally combine for a totally satisfying and gripping climax, even more gripping because it took time to come to this situation. Where the official antagonist appears, Ralph Fiennes as Harry, the boss with some serious anger management's problem, we know we are getting closer to a memorable shootout, and a movie as original as ""In Bruges"" couldn't have disappointed.But I don't want to spoil anything from that movie, just to say that the performances from Gleeson, Farrell and Fiennes, are absolutely amazing, and convincing in their mix of goofy seriousness and melancholic depth. In many moments all through the film, especially in the scenes featuring Ken and Ray, you never cease to feel extreme empathy for these people whose presence in Bruges seems to serve a purpose that goes beyond the mission, as if it meant something even deeper, strangely deeper, they can't even figure what  as if Bruges was in the crossroads of these fates where something new was going to explode from these cocktails of feelings, of traumas and repressions, like those kind of holidays where we do change, from redemption or alienation, or both  but this is not a movie to over-analyze. The intellectual approach is smoothly invited near the ending when we collect the right pieces of the puzzle, and wait for us to find the last, the most precious piece, which still relies on the central character's soul, Ray.Ray is not necessarily deeper than Ken, and at many points, Ken is the most likely to get our sympathy, but what makes Ray more interesting is the way he's highlighted and foiled by the people he meets. Ray makes us encounter strange and unforgettable characters in a way that seems to go nowhere, like the very trip in a random place named Bruges, and the greatness of that film, is to make you wait until the end before you realize, they couldn't have chosen a better place to live this adventure. In Bruges, as the quintessential charm of the apparent insignificance which offers the best setting to explore our lives' own insignificance until the ultimate realization, that some things must change. Damn, whenever I try to praise the comedy, I end up talking about a drama.Indeed, ""In Bruges"" seems to be more a lighthearted drama that transcends the dramatic element and translate it into something so deeply funny, that you're never quite sure if you should laugh or cry, but why hesitating, the barrier between the two is so tight, you can go back and forth from one emotion to another without feeling any emotional jet-lag. And like the story, the emotions provided gets more and more intriguing and disturbing until they culminate in a tower where comedy thrones hand in hand with the psychological thriller in a bloody honeymoon, in a small town, named Bruges  Bruges finally put in the Belgian map, in Belgium, the country that ""Man Bites Dog"", another masterpiece of Black Comedy, put in the map too  Bruges as the crossroads of destinies, or dead-end, or both  Bruges as the town, we hate so much, we just can't live in, but can't leave it either",In Bruges

It's a generally entertaining, twist-and-turn-laden time that has some tangible consequences and proper payoffs for pretty much everything it sets up, including a complete central character arc. Ultimately, though, this tight thriller is let down by the occasionally forced, sometimes (purposefully) inappropriate humour and its overall detrimental 'edginess'. 7/10",In Bruges
38,dromasca,Beauty and Violence in Bruges,8,24 January 2009,"I had the chance to see a few years ago one of Martin McDonagh's plays 'Pillowman' and came to know one of the more interesting theater authors today. 'In Bruges' is his first feature film, and while his path from a controversial and successful author of theater to director reminds David Mamet, the characters and mood of his film are more related to the world of Tarantino.Here is the story. Ken and Ray are two Irish mob killers who are sent into hiding after having murdered one more innocent victim than necessary. As our gangsters have a soul the younger of the two is full of remorse for the collateral victim who happened to be a kid, and as the gangsters world has a code of honor the elder of the two is charged with applying the capital punishment to the younger one. Here comes one of the best scenes I have seen recently on screen, with Ken with a gun at hand walking in a park towards Ray with the intention to kill him, and ending by saving his life by preempting his suicide. Genial - I believe that this scene may win an Oscar for original script to Martin McDonagh.The city of Bruges is playing more than a background role in the film. With its so European order, cultural atmosphere and quiet beauty it contrasts at first sight with the brutal characters sent into hiding under the disguise of the world worst tourists. And yet it is the simple humanity of the place and civility of its people that ends by engulfing the two heroes and making them find inside themselves the resources of questioning the sense of their own actions. The middle of the film takes almost a moralistic and religious tone when dealing with these issues. When the brutal world the two belong to surges back under the person of the mafia boss come to fulfill the rules of the crime world code of honor, even his actions end by submitting to the ritual of European politeness. As in his plays, you are never sure whether McDonagh is ironic or respectful towards the world he describes.Good acting helps a well told story, which develops in a natural manner despite the quite unusual premises. Colin Farrell, an actor that critics love to hate for roles like the ones in 'Alexander' or 'S.W.A.T.' is simply marvelous as Ray, the young gangster hitting hell at his first murder, trying to redeem himself and showing that he is so much better than his own actions. Brendan Gleeson as Ken, the elder, wiser and even more cultural-prone of the two adds his own human dimension, enhanced in a classical gangster movies ending which otherwise looks somehow not fit into the rest of the film. Ralph Fiennes is cast here completely against his type (another fine choice of the director) and does a wonderful job as the hysterical mafia boss enforcing the code of honor to its ultimate consequences. Clémence Poésy provides the romantic trigger igniting the spark of humanity in Ray, while Jordan Prentice allows to the director the throwing of ironical arrows towards David Lynch and the dwarf-haunted surrealistic dreams in his movies.Hopefully McDonagh will continue this path of his career as film director after this remarkable start. His own play-writing with the cut-edge irony, black humor and the sharpness of drawing his characters is probably the best source of inspiration and the best chance for his voice to become fully original, away from the other film makers who influenced his beginning.",In Bruges
39,g-bodyl,Bloody Brilliant Film!,10,19 July 2013,"In Bruges is a masterful dark comedy mixed with elements of an excellent crime thriller and together, those two genres created a cinematic gem. It seems like British films are increasingly getting better or I should say more abstract than Hollywood films. I'm not convinced that an American studio would make a film like this. This film has some sharp, witty dialog and it proves to be effective, especially during the bantering of Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson.Martin McDonagh's film is about two hit men who are sent to Bruges to cool things off after a failed hit attempt. But things go awry when the crime boss comes to town to settle things.The acting is very good. I think Colin Farrell is underrated but this film shows he has the makings to be a bona-fide star. His sharp turns and the way he gives his dialog is very memorable. He and Gleeson have absolutely one hundred percent chemistry with each other. Ralph Fiennes makes a great baddie as we know because of his role as Voldemort in the Harry Potter films. But, he's not entirely bad and I love to see that in a bad guy.Overall, this is a dark comedy that has a little bit of everything. It has thrilling moments, some action, comedy, a little bit of romance, and some blood. It also can be classified as a satire and a witty one too. It has a very memorable screenplay and is one of the best of 2008. I knew this would be a good film and I'm glad I was not disappointed. I rate this film 10/10.",In Bruges

42,secondtake,"At first beautifully slow, then just slow, and then a bit forced...",6,4 May 2011,"In Bruges (2008)A quiet film about a couple of hit men hiding in Bruges, one of them loving it (played by Brendan Gleeson) and the other (Colin Farrell) bored and unappreciative. They run into trouble in several ways, mainly learning that they are not there to hide out after all, but this only turns into a kind of shoot 'em up climax that isn't what the movie's arc really intends. A couple of side characters have some effect on events, mainly a drug running love interest (Clemence Poesy) who is meant to be searing and different but comes off a bit stilted, and a dwarf in a movie being filmed there (Jordan Prentice) who is charming and a little incidental after all.What really works best is the screenplay. The writing is sharp, and the idea, offbeat within a large and well-worked genre, develops with some nice turns. Oddly, the back and forth humor between these hit men doesn't quite gel despite their good dialog, and I think it's just bad casting or bad directing, because Gleeson and Farrell sure are trying to be ironic and wry and a bit doltish. Maybe they try too hard. Or maybe it really is the direction, under Martin McDonagh, who did also help with the writing. This is McDonagh's first full fledged film (he made an earlier prescient short, ""Six Shooter,"" also starring Gleeson). The complexity of the plot isn't overwhelming, but the threads seems to coexist rather than interweave. It gets especially single-minded (and heavy handed) when the master hit-man arrives, played beautifully by Ralph Fiennes. The violence becomes a series of tricks and spectacular effects, and it's entertaining but never quite gripping or enchanting or whatever it is this strange series of events is aiming for.Bruges, which plays its own role in the film, is gorgeous, even for a hit-man, and the film was filmed there for good reason. But expect only a slight diversion here, one bubbling with possibility but falling flat on the tongue.",In Bruges
43,tabuno,Real Gritty and Edgy Drama That Misses In Places,7,20 January 2019,"28 January 2009. ""In Bruges"" is an uncomfortable experience with Colin Farrell as a rather abrasive protagonist and not the most likable fellow who is both insensitive and a brute and its a wonder why a woman would actually like him. While there's an effort to portray him with some remnant of sympathy, his guilt seems to wear a bit thin. This a beautifully well shot movie, with much of the foreign flavor captured on film along with a lovely musical score. The script is strong, harsh, brutal along with some rather risky comical inserts that are in a few places appear forced for aesthetic sake. Overall, this is an intensely strong and moving film if one can except the characters, their circumstances. Perhaps, in some ways, Colin Farrell reflects a little bit of reality of all of us, the good and the dirty parts. In this way, the movie might be considered actually a black, dark comedy of some note. The ending is a bit convenient, maybe too much so for the audience's discretion to make it what they want.

44,ironhorse_iv,I was waiting for a movie like this. In Bruges. It's worth the site-seeing. I know I'm awake but it feels like I'm in a dream.,8,16 December 2013,"Apparently I grew up on a farm, because In Bruges impresses me very much. Directed by Martin McDonagh, the film, In Bruges is an interesting character driven movie. The characters in this movie are as human and fully fleshed out as it gets. A really dark comedy, the film is about two Irish hit men, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) going into hiding in the Belgian city of Bruges after a hit went horrible wrong. They are waiting for a phone call from their violent crime boss with unbending principles, Harry (Ralph Fiennes) for further actions. The city of Bruges become a center point of the plot, as both see it in different ways. Ray sees the oldest well preserved medieval city, as boring and a personal hell nightmare for him wanting to get out of it. While, immature and his youth showing, Ray throughout the film is plunges into a state of depression and a torturous emotional experience, guilt for the hit going bad. Without spoiling it, he understand he violated moral standards of his crime, and looks for a way out by extreme pleasure, only to find himself paralyzed more to the guilt. Ken, the wiser of the two, sees the city as a dream due to its old buildings architecture and the rich history of its streets. Like Samuel Beckett's 'Waiting for Godot' novel, the two characters play off each other on everything from living life to how to die in what to do, while waiting for Harry. Ray wants to party it up with a drug-dealer love interest Chloe (Clémence Poésy) and dwarf actor Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), while Ken wants to go site-seeing. The film is rich with symbolism and ideas. I love the film within a film notice such in the way, Ray met Chloe and Jimmy. A dream sequence kinda out of pastiche or homage of Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now. A 'nod of the head'. The whole scene would foreshadow a lot of the end. The arrival of the phone call is the film's climatic moment as it put the film into motion. A nice reference by showing the opening shots of Touch of Evil, is clue that's things will not end well, for the two. The movie is about the conflict of principles. Harry is play out as the grim reaper of the film, as he thinks that anybody who did the same crime that Ray does, deserves to die. Ken acting as the guardian angel believes people has the capacity to change and deserves a second chance. It's a human struggle of how to seek justice. By having the medieval city as a background, all three of men represent the both extreme of religionist viewpoints on how justice is served. When Ray and Ken visit the art museum and look upon ""The Last Judgment"" painting by Hieronymous Bosch. They walk into a surreal dream. Somehow, how purgatory might be looked at, based on Irish mythology. The idea of waiting for their inevitable fate in an unknown land is a common theme in philosophical Irish literature. When, Ray look upon the painting, The Flaying of Sisamnes by Gerard David, we knew that the guilt was eaten himself him, ripping him apart. All the actors did pretty well in this film. Colin Farrell's character is somewhat likable, but I found myself, not caring much about his fate due to some really annoying prickly jerk moments. It kindly turn me off the film. I found myself, relating more to the Ken character because he had more a moral code. Then again, the movie didn't had any heroes much to root for. It's perfectly alright to kill people, but don't you dare accidentally shot a kid. What type of moral code is this film presenting? I found myself, choosing the less of two evils. The hope of redemption and forgiveness is held out by Ken to Ray, doesn't resolve as this film gives blood-splattering conclusion where nobody wins. I don't think, Ray learn anything, besides wanting to live. He's doesn't seem like he wants to live to do better. It's seem he want to live for lust or fear of dying reasons. Hints why, I found Chloe to be a really horrible character. Brendan Gleeson display one of the best performance, I ever saw of him. Ralph Fiennes is just brilliant. The twisted humor is a hit and miss. I found myself, laughing in a few mean-spirited jokes, and at others, not at all. I did like the comedy of errors. The pacing is good, each scene didn't seem like a filler, as it serve its purpose, and move on quickly. I did find it, dragging in the pointless dwarf hooker party scene. I did love the perfect irony ending. The film was nominated for Best Original Screenplay award at the 81st Academy Awards in 2009, and I can see why. It was well-written, maybe a bit too nihilism for my taste. The violent and gore was alright. Not to cheesy, nor unrealistic. The jump from Belfry tower of Bruges was a bit out there, gross. The language was alright for a gangster flick, but I did find Harry 'f-bomb' letter, just too cartoony. The music score by Carter Burwell is forgettable, and disappointed. I can't remember a damn thing about it. As a travelogue, I think the film is most impression as I didn't know much about Bruges before this film. The camera shots are great. High angle shots are used on church item, creating the impression that religion will be theme throughout the duration of the film, looking down on the characters. Close ups are great to show the coping of the aftermath of mistakes. Mise en Scene for the dreaming scenes. Overall: worth seeing, no matter if you're in Bruges or not.",In Bruges
45,kenjha,A Hit,8,3 April 2009,"After a botched job, two London hit men are sent to Bruges, Belgium to lay low for a while, unaware of what their evil boss has planned for them. A delightful black comedy, highlighted by the witty banter between Farrell and Gleeson, the hit men with contrasting interests. The two actors work well together and Fiennes is hilarious as their quick-tempered boss. The dramatic elements are somewhat weak and don't mesh very well with the comedy, and the last part of the film goes a bit too far with the violence. However, for the most part, this film is quite enjoyable. A remarkable feature film debut for McDonagh, who wrote and directed.",In Bruges
46,Floated2,Not what I was Expecting,3,7 August 2014,"In Bruges is intended to be a comedy, but moreso a dark comedy. However, I didn't find it funny. It never occurred to me to laugh, or chuckle, or even smile. The dialog can be clever and witty but nothing gave the sense to laugh. The chemistry between the leads are good as it makes it somewhat interesting, but overall In Bruges suffers and feels all over the place.A plot hole near the end occurs when (a guy) gets shot in the carotid artery. He still has enough blood and energy left to climb up a bunch of steps and jump out of a window 250 feet high. After he lands on his head, squishing on the ground like a tomato, he still can talk and give instructions before he says, ""I think I'm going to die now."" On the positive side, it is filmed on location in Bruges, which is the most well-preserved medieval city in all of Belgium. The sites are beautiful but I wasn't blown away by the cinematography. Perhaps a second watch could renew my thoughts.",In Bruges
47,johnnyboyz,"Enjoyable and funny but never loosing focus in both its narrative and study, In Bruges hits most marks rather impressively.",7,14 February 2009,"What a neat, compact and thoroughly entertaining little package In Bruges actually is - a film that never takes itself too seriously, but will have you feeling some sort of slap of emotion if you've gone with it by the time the finale has arrived. The film is an extremely black comic piece, relying on jokes and humour that targets specific ethnicities and 'types' of people but at the same time includes the necessary substance through slyly introducing events and flashbacks, confirming why certain characters carry certain hate ridden and confused opinions on their surroundings. The film is encouraging in another sense; a British director running on British fuelled money directing a debut piece he also wrote and quite clearly using other British co-writers/directors from recent times as a source of inspiration.The sources for this inspiration range from Guy Ritichie to Simon Pegg with an essence of Jonathan Glazer's 2000 gangster outing Sexy Beast thrown in for good measure and it all pulls through rather nicely. Interestingly, fellow writer/director Martin McDonagh pays tribute, not necessarily directly to these people but certainly acknowledges he's updating and referencing, very early on when one of the lead characters stumbles across a film set. Here, he meets a young Belgian female production assistant and she exclaims that 'what we're doing here is an homage; a pastiche is too strong-a word for the project'. The lead's confused reaction might well be the same for some audience members but the girl has nailed it and McDonagh has nailed it in his own screenplay.It is a homage; maybe pastiche IS too strong-a word but it is poignant this exchange happens on a film set. McDonagh has cleverly brandished his two leads Irish, making it particularly difficult to label them British gangsters of sorts but you know exactly where he's coming from. In Bruges sees two Irish hit men hiding out in the Belgian city of Bruges following a botched job. Their orders are to wait for a phone call from English mafia boss Harry (Fiennes) as he assesses the situation but Harry has a dilemma and when he does call, his intentions are far more menacing. But that would be spoiling the fun. The two leads are Ken (Gleeson) and Ray (Farrell) and their initial time spent there has the film crack its best jokes that are particularly un-PC but also sees the script establish several complex emotional pieces of substance to back up the content. It appears Ray is having a bit of a break down and thus resorts to verbal insults and discrimination as well as adopting a relatively childlike persona, best highlighted at his glee at the sight of dwarfs, beer and his bemoaning at the sights of historical buildings.Since we do not get to know Ray prior to his 'tragedy', we cannot compare mentalities before/after. Ken seems to have known Ray for a certain amount of time and acts as a foil to Ray once all the bickering in Bruges begins. The important thing here is that Ken actually replies to Ray's bickering so all the complaining and un-PC comments Ray says in Belgium probably does not reflect the kind of person he really is. If he'd been like this even 'before' the event, perhaps Ken would've got sick of always snapping back and might've let Ray just get on with it. If Ray is an assassin, we expect a certain degree of professionalism from him but what we get is a spoilt child performance conflicting archetypes. He is, indeed, referred to as 'the boy' by characters later on.Ray's badgering sees him insult the Belgians, fat people, autistic people and dwarfs but this sort of neurotic behaviour is confirmed when it becomes apparent Ray's suffering an identity crisis and is branching off into a mindset of guilt and suicidal ideation, hence his too sharp-a tongue and insults. For a long time, we share Ken's viewpoint. We are disgusted at Ray's dialogue and we get to hear first hand of the revelation Harry calls up with. But the perspective begins to shift quite brilliantly when things become apparent and emotion comes to the forefront.Ralph Fiennes' Harry Waters is introduced brilliantly. He carries a Don Logan persona about him and the same air of menace with the constant badgering and talk of things seemingly innocent and random, only off screen down a telephone. Our first actual look at him in his England home whilst on the phone is a really tasty piece of editing. McDonagh's fast, wise talking gangsters are indebted to Guy Ritchie and his branching off into a fast paced action film that actually has its characters acknowledge the finale is nearing and that ""this is the shootout"" nearer the end is more a link to Hot Fuzz than anything else. Again, the film set location within the film pops up at the end and it's no coincidence this is where the fatal blows are played out.While nobody weeps for the priest Ray killed on the job in the flashback and the fact Harry has young kids of his own which is quite alarming, the film is brutally entertaining and shot in cold, bleak and distant colours commending the psychological feelings Ray goes through. The film begins in a jovial and juvenile manner but we're hit with a brick that knocks both us and the film into focus rather than off course, which is very refreshing for a change. Fast; witty and quite humbling at times, In Bruges is a winner.",In Bruges
48,Red-125,A fairy tale about a fairy-tale city,9,20 April 2008,"In Bruges (2008), written and directed by Martin McDonagh, stars Colin Farrell as Ray and Brendan Gleeson as Ken. These two professional killers have been sent to Bruges to lie low after a killing-gone-wrong. Their boss is Harry, played by Ralph Fiennes, who follows their progress by phone from England.Ray is hyperactive, depressed, and hates Bruges. Ken can actually enjoy the wonders of Bruges, even though it's just a stop on the road to the next killing. Clémence Poésy is Chloë, a woman who hangs around movie sets to deal drugs and offer her body as enticement to the unwary. I've been to Bruges twice, and it's probably the most enchanting city I've ever seen. It's called the Sleeping Beauty city because progress passed it by, and there was no incentive to tear down the old and build the new. By the time people got around to modernizing Bruges, they understood the value of a city preserved as if in amber, and they left it the way it was. (You actually get a pretty good tour of Bruges in the movie, and it looks beautiful. That's the point--it's a beautiful city in which terrible things are happening.)The terrible things naturally involve Ray, Ken, Harry, Chloë, and other lowlife types as well. What makes the story a fairy tale is that all kinds of mayhem take place on the streets and in the houses of Bruges, and no one except the main characters appears to notice. People shoot at each other, coins rain down from a tower, and a police officer never appears. Bruges has police, and they intervene there as they would intervene anywhere else. You have to suspend disbelief to accept their absence in the film.Despite this lack of realism, the movie is both a powerful psychological study and a real thriller. It's definitely worth seeking out in a theater, and will work fairly well on the small screen as well. See it!",In Bruges
49,filipemanuelneto,"Shootings, violence, insults, cynicism, intelligence and Bruges.",7,20 May 2021,"This is a film that does not fit any audience, mainly, I believe, those who are or live in the city of Bruges, Belgium. And I say this because I felt that the film was not at all sympathetic to this beautiful city, one of the most iconic cities in Flanders, and an old and important commercial trade port with which Portugal had privileged commercial relations in the Middle Ages. It is a magnificent and very well-preserved city, which the film insults a lot.The script is simple: two professional assassins flee from England and hide in Bruges, according to their boss's orders. However, what happens next is that each of them will live those days in their own way, interacting with the city in an individual and personal way, while waiting for the next instructions.The film could not be more provocative and incorrect: the actors insult the city, they insult the Americans, they insult each other. Dialogues laden with profanity and insults are aggressive and politically incorrect. The scenes involving the dwarf, and the jokes around him, are very especially infamous. However, the film proved to be engaging and capable of entertaining, in addition to having an interesting dose of black humor and profoundly intelligent cynicism, hidden under the high dose of aggression. The worst was, indeed, the ending, which sounds forced and unconvincing.There are hidden and barely visible qualities in this film, which the excellent work of the cast was able to exploit, bringing to life hateful characters, but elegantly constructed and complex. Colin Farrell shows all of his talent and was really extraordinary in his role. Brendan Gleeson is not an actor that I particularly like, and I think he always opted for somewhat rude characters, but he was excellent at bringing a very humane, honorable killer to life and establishes an excellent collaboration with Farrell. Ralph Fiennes is not the type of actor you would expect to see in such a controversial film, but he did very well and seems to have made the film for the pleasure of doing so. To some extent, the city of Bruges turns out to be a character in the film, with whom everyone is relating, in a relationship with ups and downs, moments of fascination and contempt.The film is directed by Martin McDonagh. He proved to be a skilled director, and guided his group of actors and the technical team well. At a technical level, the director offers us a great cinematography, which makes the most of the magnificent landscapes and buildings of Bruges. All scenarios were very good, in full agreement with the theme and the environment. The action scenes are good, and the effects have been well accomplished.",In Bruges
50,howard.schumann,"If it's Tuesday, this must be Belgium",8,14 April 2008,"For his first feature film, In Bruges (pronounced Broozh), Irish playwright Martin McDonagh (The Pillowman) has fashioned an absurdist black comedy about hit men hiding out in the medieval city of Bruges, Belgium, taking stock of their life while awaiting their next assignment. The film offers fabulous acting by a stellar cast, glorious scenery worthy of the best travelogue, and the characters' poignant metaphoric journey from cave to cathedral. Yet the story line about thoughtful hit men and the mobster's code of honor is artificial and self-conscious and contains some insensitive humor that comes off as more of an ""I'll show you if you think I am politically correct"" exercise than something intrinsic to the characters.Colin Farrell plays Ray, an English hit man who botched his first assignment and has been exiled to Bruges by his London handler, Harry (Ralph Fiennes), together with Ray's partner Ken (Brendan Gleeson). The absurdity of having two mobsters trying to come to terms with a city full of culture and history is quite funny and engenders some feeling about being a stranger in a strange land. The culture unfortunately is lost on Ray. He calls Bruges a *beep* hole and humors Ken who is interested in seeing the sights and attractions of the old city. In the process, McDonagh goes out of his way to be offensive to everyone including gays, dwarfs, blacks, and women, and also dumps on Americans (a safe target), showing an overweight couple taken aback when Ray suggests that they would have trouble maneuvering the winding stairs to the top of a monument.He paints Bruges as a city with Russian gunrunners and Chloe (Clemence Poesy), an attractive drug dealer selling drugs to a racist dwarf (Jordan Prentice) while an art movie is being filmed, but this has more to do with the demands of the script than the reality of Bruges. McDonagh's idea of humor seems to be his characters putting down the world around them. Ray calls the timeless art works ""rubbish by spastics"" and says he would be impressed with Bruges if he had grown up on a farm ""and was retarded"". ""Do you think this is good?"" he asks Ken ""going 'round in a boat looking at stuff?"" Neither have any idea why they are there. I guess if its Tuesday, this must be Belgium.We soon find out that Ray is racked with guilt because he accidentally killed a five-year old boy who was in the line of fire as he was murdering a priest. Naturally he has no remorse for killing the priest because that is his chosen profession and he was only doing his job. The hardball hit men turn softies right before our eyes as they ruminate about guilt, sin, and the hereafter and question what they have done and whether it means they are going to hell, Ray says, ""Aside from trying to live a good life, I have to reconcile myself to the fact that I have killed people."" Fine time to think of that. While they do not exactly engage our sympathies, the relationship between the two men is touching and they deserve credit for being willing to reexamine the choices they made in their life.One is forced to wonder about these choices even more when Ken turns up as an advocate of Ghandian non-violence after Harry emerges from London to act out his sociopathic ""principles"". What remains after the soul searching is a bit of a romance, some cool Tarantino-like hip dialogue, some obligatory chase scenes, and a contrived plot sequence involving a murderous ex-boy friend of Chloe who is blinded in one eye when Ray shoots him with a blank in self-defense. At the bottom of this is the gangster's Code of Honor that we are supposed to admire but never seems to be a part of anything real. Yet in spite of its infuriating flaws, In Bruges is always entertaining, and at times moving and does make me want to visit this entrancing city now that the lowlifes have been dispersed in true Shakespearean style.",In Bruges

53,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A well-intentioned genre experiment with mixed results,9,31 July 2008,"""In Bruges"" is a very interesting film, and as dull as that term is, it truly feels most appropriate. Writer/director Martin McDonagh's first feature length film is somewhere between a European crime comedy reminiscent of Guy Ritchie's work and an existential drama. Sometimes this works and sometimes it honestly becomes schizophrenic: a marketing nightmare. I'm not surprised it was released in the off-month of February as a result. The film is an experiment that pays dividends in ways, mostly in humor and characters, and feels curious and strange in others when it comes to the more dramatic moments. As with most experiments, it's the kind of film that some people won't be able to stand and some will flat out love.The film starts off as it was marketed, as the off-beat Euro crime comedy. The premise is simply that Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Gleeson) are hit men and their boss (Fiennes, who doesn't appear until an hour into the film) tells them to lay low in Bruges and await further instructions. The city thus plays a vital role in the plot and especially in the film's deeper meaning. The gentle balance between the humor and the themes of personal inner turmoil is where the film goes schizophrenic. The first hour is mostly all lighter and the second is substantially darker. The humor exists throughout though it grows darker as the plot does.I found the humor to be the greatest strength of the film. Each joke is sort of a swift punch in the gut: you laugh hard very quickly but it doesn't linger for long. The characters were obviously instrumental in this. Though I felt Farrell's characters was a bit too all over the place, he was really quite excellent at showing his inner monologue whenever McDonagh had a shot exclusively of him with no actual action or dialogue. Gleeson is also a terrific supporting actor and brings an interest to Ken though he's not the funnier of the two. Fiennes, though his time brief, does as he always does in sucking your attention toward him. When he plays an antagonist, he always steals moments in films and this really isn't an exception.The hidden gem of this movie is the notion of Bruges as purgatory or perhaps even hell and the way it psychologically affects the characters and their thoughts about life and death. How much you like ""In Bruges"" will pretty much depend on how well you make that connection and it resonates with you. It's easy to get caught up in only the humor of it the film and totally miss all that, or in some cases that thematic content simply is too subtle. In general, I felt that because it set the tone early on as an only minimally dark crime comedy, those themes fell short with me. So while I think ""In Bruges"" is one of the more interesting films I've seen lately, it didn't click with me all the way.",In Bruges
54,funkyfry,"OK, nothing special",6,28 June 2010,"I liked this movie; not enough to say it's some kind of great film (it's basically a less glossy variation on ""The Matador"" from a few years ago), but it's different and intelligent. Colin Farrell plays a newbie hit man who messes up his first assignment, and Brendan Gleeson is his friend who brought him into the organization and is tasked with bringing him out of it by the brutal kingpin played by Ralph Fiennes.As I say some elements seem to remind me of other movies which is how I take this movie down perhaps a few points. The buddy movie hit-man thing was similar to ""Matador"", and Fiennes' whole character, role in the story, and even his performance was a bit too similar to Ben Kingsley in ""Sexy Beast"" (which is a much better movie). However this movie of course was different because it was.... in Bruges. The novelty of the setting wears a bit thin and at that point so does the movie, although not tediously so. I think that some of the characters were too arbitrary to really hold any weight, especially the drug-dealing girlfriend character. They're really just fantasy fodder for the teenage audience that wants to feel sophisticated watching a European movie.Ultimately it's a good movie because Gleeson and Farrell are so good together, that they create some moments that are different and interesting to watch. But it all degenerates into silliness by the end.",In Bruges
55,jzappa,An Erratic Effort,9,18 August 2008,"Contract killers Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, the former a clumsy hatchling with easily ruffled feathers, the latter a calm veteran whose patience only intensifies Farrell's aggravation, are sent to the picturesque old Belgian world of Bruges by their edgy, ferocious boss Ralph Fiennes and told to await further instructions. While Gleeson peacefully absorbs the sights and historic buildings, streets and quays, Farrell is pessimistic and finicky, irritated with the lack of local nightlife. From the wild playwright of the feral, hypersensitive Lieutenant of Inishmore, this is a wonderfully enjoyable set-up for an action/comedy buddy crime film. It prepares itself with comic dynamics and quaint atmosphere, just as it markets itself in trailers, but it lets us down with an erratic handling of its tone as a jarringly dark twist in backstory unravels itself. It could have balanced its mood swings if it did not so convincingly set itself up as the duo comedy as which it was marketed.The pace accompanies the tone in the dunce corner, the film's running time being nothing more than filled by the subplot of Farrell striking up a romance with a thieving drug dealer he meets while she is working as a PA on a movie set with a temperamental dwarf actor.There is nothing wrong with a film that gets darker and darker as it unfolds, but In Bruges's missteps lay in its disappointing effect as well as its odd feeling of severing us from it, as despite its beautifully antiquated medieval scenery and occasional moment of fulfilling humor among a promising cast of great contemporary English actors, its struggle with its own contrivance being transparent more than the story's capacity to absorb.By either following through with the spirit of its exposition or helming better control over its landslides into melodrama, it could have avoided being an incoherent disappointment which, if I came across it one day with a lack of better choices, I would still watch again. I sense it as a film that has the potential to grow on you despite its nearly crippling flaws.",In Bruges
56,Chris Knipp,"The murder business, with tears and laughter",8,14 February 2008,"A friend of mine saw this before I did and said it was a strange thing, but he found Colin Farrell's performance award-worthy.It is a strange thing.Has Martin McDonagh, of the brilliant plays, made the transition to film successfully--as both writer and director? Yes and no. In Bruges is a little gem--but with the emphasis on ""little."" The squabbling gangster duo (and their boss), the violence, and the feisty dialogue recall Tarantino; so does the fun with political incorrectness. But McDonagh hasn't the flair or cinematic richness of Tarantino at his best. The film-making is adept, the direction is excellent, the images are surprisingly dark and handsome, but the mise-en-scene is tame. In fact very much is made of how boring (though beautiful, and perfectly preserved) the Belgian city of Bruges is. Though it is, in a sense, all about the diaogue, which sparkles, startles, and amuses, the material is simple. The dialogue doesn't open up mind-blowing and astonishing worlds as does that of Pillowman, the play that McDonagh himself thinks has set the highest standard, of his works.A novice hit-man working in London, Ray (Farrell) botches his first hit. He's sent to Bruges with his pal Ken (Brendan Gleeson). Later their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) enters the scene. Along the way there's a pretty girl, a film set, a dwarf Ken and Ray meet on the set, a hotel clerk, an antiquarian named Yuri (Eric Godon) who dispenses guns, a skinhead, and tourists, whom Ray insults, thinking they are American.McDonagh has fun with Bruges, ""the most perfectly preserved medieval city in all of Belgium."" It does make a nice setting for a movie, if a largely static one, like a stage set but in 3-D. But Bruges is something you can do better in a movie; its beauties wouldn't translate to the stage; best to go there and film them. It's ironic that a couple of Irish hit men with an Englishh boss should be stuck there. And for a while McDonagh is content with riffing on that. You don't need much for his kind of verbal comedy. The Irish have such a way with words. Look at what Beckettt could do with two bums on a bare stage.McDonagh has said the source of this movie was a visit to Bruges he made himself. He enjoyed the tourist sites for a day or so, and then he was done with the ""culture"" and wanted some ""fun,"" ""to get drunk,"" as he's put it in interviews, ""and get laid."" Ken and Ray embody the two sides of his experience: Ken is for the culture and Ray, who's not interested in history (""It's just a lot of stuff that's already happened,"" he says), is for fun.This is good for laughs (I almost wrote ""laffs"") but underlying the story is a terrible scene we actually, vividly, witness, in which Ray kills an innocent bystander, for which he is tormented by guilt. It's this cock-up that leads to the duo's furlough in Balgium. Eventually after the boss comes in, there's a lot of blood: laughs and blood are two things Martin McDonagh knows how to deliver in a devastating one-two punch.There also has been by then a knockout and a blast in the face and a coke party in which the dwarf who's a movie actor from America predicts a coming war between blacks and whites in which you won't have to take sides: you'll have no choices.The success of all this in a film shows that Martin McDonagh is a slick operator. It doesn't show if--whether on the screen or on the stage--he is going to sustain the genius he showed when he wrote seven plays in a year or so nine years ago. Another thing it does show,is that Colin Farrell, who's turned away from his popularization by Hollywood, has perfect pitch for this kind of thing, and can go from scornful to desperate without losing his puppy-dog charm. Girls still go wild for his black moth eyebrows. The American critics don't seem to have been terribly impressed by In Bruges, however. It is a fine performance but a minor one, as a film.You will enjoy it more, I should think, if you have not seen the US trailer for it, which as so unfortunately and so often happens nowadays presents six or seven or eight of the key scenes of the movie with the best dialogue zingers culled out of them in a row, so that as you watch the movie, especially if you've been subjected to the same trailer five times as I was, you'll find yourself haplessly ticking the scenes off as they appear in context. And because the tone is so right in McDonagh's writing, and, especially when Farrell is talking (but Fiennes and Gleeson and the others are all extremely good), each of these zingers encapsulates a big chunk of the movie. And this kills all the freshness of it. I wish movie promoters would stop doing this. It's a virtual crime. They should be sent to Bruges and made to stay there forever.",In Bruges
57,elshikh4,"A movie about Hit-men, purgation, and the contemporary western civilization !",8,20 September 2012,"Every once in a blue moon, we get a genre movie with meaning. And it's even rarer to have it in equilibrium; namely where the genre doesn't exceed the meaning, or vice versa. (In Bruges) is one of those movies. Nevertheless, the balance was partly, just partly, missed.The best about this movie was how it managed to be multidimensional. Outwardly, it's crime / black comedy. It has not ""many of"" but nearly ""all"" the right stuff: unique characters, with several antics. Hot ping pong dialogue. Engaging European backgrounds. Touchy, even if short, music. Sharp-witted pace. And all perfect performances; surprisingly (Colin Farrell) uncovers how creatively comedic he can be! It's impossible to pinpoint one downside in this cast's work. So, it provides entertainment, in its own dark taste.Then, inwardly, it's thought-provoking with philosophical dimension. The haunting guilt is cleverly portrayed. I loved the matter of ""whether jail or death was my fate, I would welcome any of them"", all for ending the compunction, and achieving the purgation. And although death is all over the story, it emphasizes the importance of life and love, because with them maybe we may win penance, second chance, and some happiness.Notice well the names of the characters. They can be read metaphorically. For instance, Ray is a hit-man who did wrong yet has a ""beam"" of conscience. Ken, meaning ""perceive"" or ""view"", suits the character as more experienced than his fellow Ray. The punisher is named Harry; which means ""attack"" or ""oblige"". And finally there is a hope in the future, through the pregnant hotel owner; whose name is Marry, maybe as a reference to the Virgin Mary, who'll give birth to a new Christ, to guide and forgive the sinners.Not only this, the movie has some sort of deep and wicked social / political point of view. It shows a western world of decadence. The Irish, the American, the Belgium people are presented as killers, drug addicts, drug dealers, gun dealers, prostitutes, thieves, racist, depressed or suicidal lost souls. The survivors of all that are the priest, and the little boy. However, they're not completely survivors, because they were killed earlier. So here we are, facing a community of human filth, that murdered its spiritual side (the priest), along with its innocence (the little boy), devoting itself to finish itself later, unless there is a desire to purge (Bruges and purge are similar words, aren't they?!). You may consider it another *Noir* world, but aside from meditative reading for the characters, you can't miss the unmistakable irony between the tranquil solemn antiquities (the old civilization), and the boisterous destructive leads (today's civilization), as the grandfathers built the great high towers, and the grandsons just fall over them!Cut to the missing balance issue; and I mean nothing but the movie's last 10 minutes. After the moment of (Ralph Fiennes) getting out of the tower, with his gun, it's all downhill from there. Look how logic takes a dive and sinks: How the man, who always sticks to his principles, betrays those principles stupidly? He said earlier that he won't shoot his target in front of 3000 Belgium citizens. Now he's with a gun, running after his target, shooting him non-stop, all over Bruges's streets, in front of 4000 Belgium citizens!!! Obviously, it was a desire that scriptwriter / director (Martin McDonagh) had of filming a crazy action sequence a la Hollywood. Or maybe, the movie needed that to be sold, since shootouts look good in any trailer of a movie, especially this ""no action, all talk"" movie!The one-eyed thief, who was half-blinded by (Farrell), runs into (Fiennes), who arrived to kill the same (Farrell), in the gun dealer's home accidentally, and in the same night that thief sees (Fiennes) getting into the tower accidentally, then sees (Farrell) near the same place, also accidentally (?) That was simply forced! Then, the midget wears as a little boy, stands right beside (Farrell) while he's being killed, takes a bullet in his head so his features may not be clear, so Mr. I-stick-to-my-principles shoots himself for killing a kid--all of that was tooooo forced to say the least! It surely weakened the solid movie, making its end no solid at all.Various bothering points : a line said by (Farrell)'s character, while his anger in the restaurant; ""He pauses, even though he should just hit the ""..."", and he repeats: Yes, I am talking to you. What's ""..."" unbelievable?!!"" which was unbelievably intellectual for that character to say, fitting more the mentality of an author, or an actor, or an author who wanted to express his own character through an actor! Add to that, naturally, the lasting waterfall of the F words, the blasphemy, and some obnoxious violence; these were points to hate, more than to bother, to tell you the truth!(In Bruges) is a genre movie that goes beyond the entertainment of its genre. But exaggerating the portion of entertainment, at the end, harmed it. Hence, it ends up as a movie about hit-men, purgation, and the contemporary western civilization, however with chaotic made-up ending. At any case, Hurray for that ""script"". If you watch many movies, you have to appreciate it, since it is not frequent to run into something like it, very.",In Bruges

Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell are hit men on the run and in hiding due to a screws up on their last killing. A scene with a priest and a confessional is worth the price of admission alone. Mcdonagh's sense of humor is wicked and the film gets stranger and stranger.Ray(Colin Farrell) has accidentally killed a boy and his Catholic guilt resonates with him, while his partner, Ken(Brendan Gleeson) is happy go lucky and the complete opposite of his brooding friend.

Both the leads and Ralph Fiennes, who plays their profane, volatile boss Harry, are excellent in a clever, sharply scripted story of a short but bloody path to redemption. Religious symbolism is deftly woven in throughout the movie, in which Bruges serves as heaven, purgatory, or hell depending on the character, including imagery from Hieronymus Bosch's famous painting Last Judgment (itself sort of a 'black comedy').

They are meant to prose as tourists as their await for instructions from their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes). They do this despite Ray hating the city; but he finds someone for entertainment in the form of Chloë (Clémence Poésy). Ray attempts to seduce the young woman and ends up going through a number of bouts of violence in the process. But in the midst of the fun and games Ken is given an impossible choice by Harry whilst in the city which if he doesn't do it his life is forfeit.In Bruges is the first film from Martin McDonagh who is best known as a playwright in Ireland: but well, he has a talent as a director and screenwriter. In Bruges is funny throughout and whilst it does edge towards being offensive at times, McDonagh uses this to his advantages. McDonagh writes an excellent script with great, witty dialogue, funny jokes, a bit of violence slapstick and a simple but effective and believable story. His talent as a director also is shown, allowing for comedy and violence but also there are moments of real drama, darkness and character development. There is an event that couldn't be done in a Hollywood and McDonagh does shock the audience with it. McDonagh's pacing is quick and for a first time director he has some excellent shots from funny fight scenes to a more touching small moment with Colin Farrell lying in bed and cries out a single tear.There is an excellent cast in the film. Colin Farrell before this film had a reputation as a bad boy and his acting career seemed to be on the slide to poor action and indie films. But with In Bruges he was able to bounce back and proved that he is a talented actor, having excellent comedic timing and able to show he can also be a serious actor with his role. This is the best film he has ever done. Ralph Fiennes was very funny and effective as the foul-mouth Cockney gangster with a short temper. This is a very different role for the man and excellent in the film. Brendan Gleeson too was very good in the film and with Colin Farrell a very funny double. Clémence Poésy's role wasn't as developed as the other characters but she was decent. Jordan Prentice was very funny as a bigoted dwarf American actor making a film in the city.Basically an outrageously funny film throughout.",In Bruges
61,dfranzen70,"Sadly, no midgets are tossed",7,9 March 2008,"Two hit men hide out in an unassuming Belgian town in this thriller, which starts out as a quiet two-character study and then jukes and jives its way to a screamingly violent conclusion. In Bruges is a low-rent Pulp Fiction knockoff, but it's a knockoff that pays off in spades, with strong, believable acting, excellent cinematography, and a taut, amusing script.Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) have just completed a rather difficult job and have been ordered by their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to repair to the idyllic town of Bruges to lay low for up to two weeks. ""Two weeks with you?"" Ray exclaims to Ken. ""No way!"" Ray's a novice to the world of hit-manning, and being as young as he is he's not too keen to spend two weeks in any spot that's not teeming with hot women or other fun things to do. Bruges isn't exactly a Mecca of excitement, you see. On the other hand, the more seasoned Ken is pretty happy with staying in the placid little burg, because it'll give him time to sightsee and take it easy.Both men start to believe there's something else afoot. Why Bruges, after all? They're Londoners, so why not hide out in London, or even in the English countryside? No, they had to schlep over to Belgium. (There are plenty of Belgian jokes, and a smart dig at Americans that was both accurate and snicker-worthy.) But before Ray can get properly bored, he meets a sweet young lady named Chloe (Clemence Poesy, late of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) working on a movie that's being filmed right there in Bruges, and he sees a chance to redeem himself for past sins - but apparently Chloe has a few dark secrets of her own.Gleeson and Farrell are wonderful together, and the film avoids such clichés as the young impetuous hothead and the veteran killer on one last job, and you never get the impression that they're just a couple of lunkheads who go around killing people randomly. (You know the type: Guy gets tired awaiting further instructions, so he shoots someone to keep in practice.) And of course, nothing goes as Ray and Ken expect it to go. There's no way, of course, that they're going to stay the entire two weeks in the podunk town with nothing happening, right? Yeah, probably not.So they wait around for Harry to call and give them further instructions, and when he does all hell really breaks loose. But setting that aside for the moment, here are some other entertaining aspects of the movie: drug use, gunplay, midgets, and blood. Yes, midgets! Okay, dwarfs. And although there's no dwarf tossing, there is a karate chop to a dwarf's neck, which is awesome in and of itself.Another plus is the film is remarkably well shot. Filming on location in the actual town of Brugge in Belgium, cinematographer Eigil Bryld brilliantly juxtaposes the angularity of the buildings and the beauty of the landscapes with the brutality of the men's violent behavior and coarse language. The pooling of blood on stark, gritty pavement, surrounded by gleaming snowdrifts and the pulchritude and quiet desperation of Bruges itself.Although not as wittily intelligent as Pulp Fiction, In Bruges is still quite clever - and not too clever for its own good, either. It's not one of those movies that tosses in funny dialog just to be funny or so-called twists just to keep the viewer guessing. Two charming, gutsy performances by Gleeson as the unorthodox older man and Farrell as the twitchy younger one boost this one up a notch about the typical caper thriller.",In Bruges
62,ackstasis,"""Maybe that's what hell is: the entire rest of eternity spent in Bruges""",8,26 December 2009,"'In Bruges (2008)' is director Martin McDonagh's feature debut, and it promises excellent things to come. His film shows the influence of Guy Ritchie's 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)' and 'Snatch (2000),' but is mostly without the excessive stylisation of Ritchie's films. For two hours, the film delicately blends black comedy and action, exploring difficult themes of life and death, but in a manner entirely without pretension. McDonagh's highly-quotable screenplay (""they're filming midgets!""), despite an over-reliance on obscenities, enjoyed an Oscar nomination, but otherwise the film escaped most official recognition.After an assassination attempt goes wrong, two London hit-men take shelter in the unfamiliar Belgian city of Bruges. While the philosophical Ken (Brendan Gleeson) takes an interest in the city's historical architecture, the impatient Ray (Colin Farrell) takes to complaining at every possible opportunity. Eventually, the unique history and people of Bruges – including stunning local girl Chloe (Clémence Poésy) and an American midget actor (Jordan Prentice) – leads both men to reevaluate their lives, for better or worse. When specific orders are ultimately disobeyed, their disgruntled boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) reluctantly flies to Bruges to settle matters himself. 'In Bruges' contains several scenes that don't quite work: the midget's narcotics-fuelled rant about interracial warfare feels like forced drug humour, and the climax seems to operate out of ironic obligation rather than an understanding of character. However, Gleeson and Farrell share a chemistry that is amusing and often quite moving. The city of Bruges, whatever Ray has to say about it, is photographed with fondness and affection, depicted as a sort of historical sanctuary where time stands still. Two friends of mine plan on touring Europe later next year. Their proposed itinerary includes the staple capital cities of Berlin, Amsterdam and Paris. 'In Bruges' may, indeed, have added an additional pit-stop to their journey.",In Bruges
63,meeza,"Loved it ""In Bruges""",10,13 February 2009,"When I had my cinematic travel experience in ""In Bruges"", it was a sheer entertainment extravaganza. Writer-Director Martin McDonagh's ""In Bruges"" creation was a juicy blood-broiled black comedic offering, with a few Irish fried hit men to go along with it. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson star as Ray and Ken, the aforementioned hit men protagonists who are ordered by their mob boss Harry to lay low in Bruges, Belgium due to the fact that Ray accidentally killed a young boy on a hit job. Ken takes a touristy liking to Bruges, while Ken thinks that Bruges is the boredom capital of the world. Their hit men chemistry was definitely on target, and in equilibrant comparison to Jules & Vincent in the classic ""Pulp Fiction""; and this is a fact! Team Kenray do come across some eccentric characters while in Bruges including a: a foul-mouthed dwarf actor, a one-eyed robber, and a rude Canadian couple. A ray of sunshine appears in Ray's torturous Bruges experience when he meets the beautiful ecstasy drug dealer Chloe. Things get a bit hairy for Ray & Ken when Harry comes to Bruges to hunt them down for hit men insubordination; if such thing exists. Colin Farrell was phenomenal as Ray with his witty banter on his hatred for Bruges. Farrell also did the best heavy emotional work in his career portraying Ray as a guilt-ridden suicidal hit-man, while still maintaining his sarcastic comedic liveliness. Gleeson's subdued but resounding performance was also a sure shot winner. Ralph Fiennes continues to be one of the finest actors in the business with his hair-raising thespian fineness as the menacing Harry. I also gladly in took the ""In Bruges"" supporting acting experience with crafty performances by Jordan Prentice as the American dwarf actor Jimmy and Clemency Posey as the poised Chloe. Obviously, the city of Bruges does play an integral part of the film's symbolization. I dunno where McDonagh's imaginative genial inspiration came from for his ""In Bruges"" masterpiece direction & script; but I bet this is a McDonagh that has more tasty offerings for us to cinematically chew on for some time to come. Must also fare well to Carter Burwell's soothing ""In Bruges"" score; might just get the top score as the best movie score of the year in my book. So colonize yourself to Colin's colossal acting and the rest of the outstanding movie attractions that ""In Bruges"" has to offer. ***** Excellent",In Bruges

With traces of humor, suspense, romance, action and drama all stirred into the same bubbling pot, the risk is certainly there for overexertion, but the finished product doesn't fall short in any instance. The comedy is sharply witty and well-timed, the action fast-paced and fiery, the romance heartfelt but not heavy. Colin Farrell, whose eyebrows migrate around his forehead like a pair of pitch black caterpillars on acid, works a good range of emotions out of his fairly simple leading role and cleanly manages to get us rooting for him by the time the closing scenes roll around.

65,st-shot,A Blot on a beautiful town.,3,30 September 2008,"Director/writer Martin McDonagh's stunningly incredulous piece of sentimental claptrap involving touchy feely hit men and highly principled mob kingpins is all location, location. I've never visited a lovelier large town and this tale about a lethal Laurel and Hardy team is an insult to it's name.Ken and Ray have just performed a sloppy hit in which a priest and a young child are the victims. They're ordered to hideout in Bruges until they get further word from their boss Harry Waters. When orders do arrive they are for Ken to kill Ray. Veteran hit man Ken however goes soft for cuddly developmentally delayed Ray and can't go through with it. This is where things become absurdly unrealistic.McDonagh is well schooled in Coen and Tarantino but there are only hints of the former and an excess of the latter. There's some nice comic dialogue in the early going that balances well with the violent moments but after forty-five minutes things become convoluted and insipid as kingpin Waters takes it upon himself to go to Bruges alone assaulting citizens and running through town shooting away at Ray since from the looks of things the entire Bruges police force is on Christmas Holidays and it's left up to a pregnant hotel keeper to stand between gun toting thugs. Even though Ray and Ken go soft they are physically resilient to the point of super hero status. Ken already shot and bleeding profusely falls from a roughly three hundred foot church tower splatters on the cobblestones but still manages to warn Ray whose tough hide takes four shots to the trunk of his body but is gamely hanging on at the end. A supporting cast of ugly North Americans, a dwarf, a wimpy skin head, and a misunderstood drug dealing hooker, thief whose a sweet girl at heart are erratically developed and manage only to contribute to the films torpid pace.McDonagh spills blood liberally mixing it with heavy handed symbolism but it's pure comic book by the last half so it's hard to take the plot or the characters seriously. Colin Farrell's Ray has the makings of a fascinating and absorbing character in the films early moments but soon dilutes the suspense with a more impish than tortured approach that just repeats itself. As Ken, Brendan Gleeson displays a world weary fatigue with a convincing glum resignation that makes him the film's most interesting character before going soft and doing the inane swan dive from the church. Ralph Fiennes is completely over the top as the illogical mob boss.McDonagh does a fine job of filming Bruges, particularly at night but this is supposed to be more than a travelogue and his imagery and editing is unimaginative. In Bruges is one botched collage of poorly woven ideas, incoherently realized by a juvenile imagination. They should not have let McDonagh and company across the town line.",In Bruges
66,MaxBorg89,Two Irishmen go to Belgium...,9,23 January 2009,"British gangster film: a genre that, apart from Guy Ritchie's films and Sexy Beast, has gone pretty much unnoticed for quite some time. So what makes Martin McDonagh's feature debut any different from the rest? What justifies its status as a really good gangster movie? Well, for starters, there's a lot of religious symbolism, which fits in nicely with the incessant profanity and occasional bouts of outrageous violence. Second, and this is the real selling point: it takes place in Bruges.For anyone who's never been to the beautiful Belgian city (the official name is actually Brugge, since it's in the Dutch-speaking part of the country), McDonagh's film can serve as a satisfying tour guide, despite the consistent complaints from Ray (Colin Farrell), who calls the place ""a sh*thole"". Not that he is there willingly: he screwed up an assignment (he's a hit-man, you know), and so he and his mentor Ken are hiding abroad for a couple of weeks until their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) calls with new instructions. And while Ken laps up the gorgeous architecture, medieval streets and museums, Ray says that unless he was retarded and had grown up on a farm, there's no way Bruges could ever impress him.Then, all of a sudden, Ray has an epiphany: a film set where the main character is a rude midget (Jordan Prentice). He bonds with the little fella, falls in love with a woman named Chloe (Clémence Poésy, aka Fleur Delacour from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), and starts appreciating the town a bit more (plus, a little cocaine never detracts from the pleasure). And just as things are beginning to shape up, Harry and his instructions show up for a ""social call"".The stark contrast between beauty (the landscape) and ugliness (the language and eventual bloodshed) is the key ingredient of In Bruges' weird appeal. In fact, the two aspects come together when Ken and Ray are admiring a series of paintings by famous artist Hyeronimus Bosch and Ray just can't take his eyes off ""The Last Judgement"", a splendid yet shocking depiction of the afterlife. This is also where the film's underlying spiritual theme is unveiled: the two protagonists are seeking redemption, and Bruges is their Purgatory (although Ray has another opinion on the matter: ""This is what Hell must be like: spending the rest of eternity in f*cking Bruges!""). It may seem a bit far-fetched, but then again the characters themselves describe Bruges as something out of a fairy tale, thus justifying the movie's surreal turns (not least the fact, and it's no coincidence, that the movie-within-the-movie is inspired by Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now).But the real beauty of In Bruges doesn't lie in the setting alone: who's there is also a crucial element. Gleeson is, as expected, a tough but ultimately loving presence, and Fiennes, though ostensibly ripping off Ben Kingsley's work in Sexy Beast (but hey, so did Alec Baldwin in The Cooler), especially the language (""He swears a lot, doesn't he?"" says Ray), adds an extra notch of creepiness to what is fundamentally the villain of the piece (of course, the main characters are all gangsters, so it's a pretty strange distinction). And then there's Colin Farrell, a revelation in spite of his being in the business for over a decade. It was a given that he's a good actor (just look at Tigerland, Phone Booth or Miami Vice), but the comic and dramatic heights he reaches here, with a deeply sad yet endearingly entertaining performance (for which he won a deserved Golden Globe), show that he's still got a lot to give, and it's an impressive lot, judging from this film.Bottom line: In Bruges is brutal, filled with expletives, visually irresistible, boasts terrific acting and comes with a fascinating religious subtext. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but any lover of the gangster genre ought to check out an opus so postmodern that it actually has a conversation where one character asks two people to put their guns down and one of the shooters replies: ""Don't be stupid. This is the shootout."".",In Bruges
67,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Words cannot say how much I love this movie,10,14 June 2016,"I can't really say in enough words how much I love In Bruges. In fact there aren't words in my language which can express how deeply in tune to it I feel every time I put the DVD in for a watch, which is at least every four months or so. The dual forces of comedy and tragedy have combined here using Martin McDonough's genius script writing as an avatar to create something raucously funny and profoundly moving. The comedy is of the spiciest and very darkest nature (my favourite), and the tragedy tugs at both the heart strings and the tear ducts, scarcely giving you time to wipe away the tears of laughter from the scene that came before. The best in UK crime fare, some of the most balanced, peculiar writing and fully rounded characters who are as flawed as human beings get. Colin Farrell delves deep and gives the performance of his career as Ray, a would be hit-man who has messed up bad, and now heads for Bruges (it's in Belgium) with his mentor Ken (Brendan Gleeson, pure brilliance and humble class). Ken loves eccentric little Bruges, with its historical architecture and quaint townsfolk. Ray is bored to tears and pouts like a toddler. They meander around the town getting into all sorts of mischief including a dwarf (who has fascinating ideas about the ultimate race war), museums, cocaine, the Belgium film industry and more. Ray sets his sights on the gorgeous Chloe (), and Ken does his paternal best to keep him out of trouble while wrestling with his own gnawing guilt. The film gets a shot of pissy adrenaline when their boss Harry comes looking for them, in the form of a knock it out of the park funny Ralph Fiennes. Fiennes rarely cuts loose and bounces off the walls like he does here, and his Harry is a delightful creature to watch in action. Angry, petty, volatile, clever and out for blood, just a joy to behold. As playful as the script is, there's a purgatorial sadness to Ray's situation, a fateful sense that he's been dumped in Bruges not just to fool around, get drunk and utter witty barbs in that brogue (which he does do a lot) but to deeply ruminate on his choices and ponder where his actions will lead him moving forward from his terrible deed. Maturity permeates each exchange between him and Ken, a fledgling and an old timer shooting the breeze about heavy topics which neither of them pretend to understand, but both are neck deep in. I always cry at certain scenes, always laugh my ass off at others, and never cease to be affected right to my emotional center and the marrow of my funny bone each time I watch this. Look for a brief cameo from Ciaran Hinds in the opening few minutes. Every second of this piece is filled with lush, thought provoking dialogue, awesomely un-politically correct dialogue that doesn't censor a single impulse from its characters, and a yearning to explore the decisions which cause people to be labeled 'good' or 'bad', something that's inherently complex yet feels lightly treaded on here. Masterpiece.",In Bruges
68,kluseba,An unusual experience with extreme pleasure and radical boredom,7,11 June 2012,"""In Bruges"" is a rather unusual genre mix with many funny moments but also a couple of lengths and a more or less convincing story line. The movie mixes many comedy elements with romantic bits and pieces, a suspenseful background story, some cultural elements and a little bit of action.Sometimes, this mix gets a little bit odd. At some points, this movie is more like a tourist guide through Bruges and therefor a weird kind of documentary rather than a film with a coherent development.But the true problem lies elsewhere. The characters are so diversified that they simply aren't authentic anymore in my humble opinion. The funny guy in love suddenly is the calm and suicidal victim. The pitiless and very emotional boss suddenly becomes the consequent killer that discusses about the morality of life and death. The old and very rational killer is suddenly let by strong emotions and risks his whole existence. The sadly inevitable love story of this flick is also overused and not authentic at all.Next to these complex and strange characters, there are many stereotypical persons that appear in this movie that might make you laugh at first sight but that get quite redundant after a while, for example the dwarf or the gunrunner. This contrast is what makes this movie quite entertaining and surprising on one side but also rather odd and torn apart on the negative side. I can understand people that would rate this movie under five points and people that would give it a top rating, the whole thing heavily depends on your personal taste. If you're open-minded and just want to live a strange odyssey, the chances are good that you might at least appreciate this somehow experimental film but if you're looking for something coherent, gripping and more traditional in terms of suspense or comedy flick, you should watch a detailed trailer before you get your hands on a copy of this.The strongest point of this feature is definitely the dirty humour. I know many people that actually adore Bruges. I have been there and must admit that even though I'm pretty much interested in arts and history, this town is pretty boring and almost appeared as a sleepy ghost town to me filled with tourists and their guides and a couple of old people. That's why I can really laugh about the stereotypical descriptions of that city and the extreme discussions about its strong and weak points. These discussions and the slapstick elements in many unpredictable situations were my favourite parts in the film.I disliked the character development, basically the whole plot and the lack of true suspense after all. There were only episodes, bits and pieces of the movie that I appreciated while there were also many unnecessary lengths. Sometimes, I was extremely bored, then suddenly extremely addicted to this movie. In the end, this feature was worth to be watched and gets some credit for its experimental originality. This is something different from anything I have seen before. It's not always different in good terms but it was refreshing but also exhausting to discover something that unusual. I would though watch it again as this flick has the potential to become a cult movie and might also grow on me.",In Bruges
69,hu675,This is an unexpected treat for a dark comedy that is very original.,9,2 July 2008,"A new Contract Killer Ray (Colin Farrell) and his older wiser partner Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are sent to hide out in Bruges by their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) after an unexpected accident from a job goes wrong. Which Ray is very unhappy with the situation being sent to a city, he doesn't quite know. Although his partner is happy being in the city, especially for sight seeing and learning the history of Bruges. Ray meets Chloe (Clémence Poésy) in a movie set, which he completely finds himself attractive to her. Since Chloe is a drug dealer for a living. Both men find some happiness in the city while being stuck there, which they have to wait for Harry's call in the hotel. Although Ray is battling with depression after his first hit.Written and Directed by Martin McDonagh made an fresh, intriguing, darkly funny comedy that has hints of drama and sadness as well. McDonagh's premise could have been really cliché, there's plenty of movies about Hit-Mans. Also his movie doesn't try to be cool as well, which it's quite unique. Farrell is excellent in the picture, i haven't seen him this good in a movie (Although his dialogue are hard to understand at times, since he has a thick Irish accent). Gleeson is terrific as well. Poséy is certainly a great talent to watch for, since she's very beautiful as well. Fiennes is a hoot as the vulgar boss, which his dialogue are hilarious. Jordan Prentice is also good as the racist drug-user dwarf actor.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. I would have love to get an running commentary track by the filmmaker or even from the cast members but sadly we didn't get it. The DVD features are good, which it includes:Deleted/Extended Scenes, Bloopers and Featurettes. This is one of the few movies i been really impressive with from this year releases. It was certainly much better than i hoped for and it manages to be quite touching at times. For sure, ""In Bruges"" is going to be one of my ten 10 movies of 2008. This feature is not to be missed. Super 35. (**** ½/*****).",In Bruges

71,3xHCCH,It's an Excellent Drama with Some Funny Lines,8,11 April 2009,"Thank God for awards seasons or else low profile yet note-worthy films like ""In Bruges"" would never have made my list of movies to watch. I first read about it as one of the Top 10 films of 2008 in about.com, together with all five eventual Oscar Best Picture nominees. Then in the Golden Globes, both lead actors Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson netted nominations for Best Actor in a Comedy. Colin Farrell won his first Globe here. From then on, I knew I had to watch this.You may wonder why I put ""Drama"" as the Genre above, instead of Comedy like the Golden Globes did. Well, it is simply because I did not think this was a comedy AT ALL! The plot follows two hit men sent to the medieval town of Bruges in Belgium to hide out after a messy assignment. The main conflicts and resolution of the story are hardly a laughing matter. Very serious issues of guilt and death are tackled here, with some very violent scenes.Certainly, there are some really funny episodes and witty lines of dialogue interspersed within that main storyline. But for me, these ironic scenes and words do not a comedy make, even if that were the intention of the writer and director Martin McDonagh. Of course, this, I would not really know.The interaction of Farrell and Gleeson was flawless. They both deserved to be nominated, yet the victory of one over the other is debatable. Farrell played the younger guy Ray who carries with him the weight of a tragic miscalculation. Gleeson is his jaded senior Ken who has already learned to find the good in bad situations. Ralph Fiennes adds to the mix with a startling performance as their malevolent boss Harry, who has a weird misplaced sense of honor.More interesting color is added to the film by the various flawed characters the two meet in Bruges. Despite the number of these people in the sidelines, each one plays an important role in the story and film never loses its focus. I have to mention here the very pretty love interest Chloe (Clemence Poesy) and the midget actor Jimmy (Jordan Prentice) for putting in some memorable quality screen time and dialogue.Although excellent, this may not be a film for everyone. The violent scenes can be quite bloody. There are several lines that may offend midgets, blacks and Belgians, but I guess that is where most of the black humor lay. In addition, I appreciated the fact that I watched a copy with good subtitles since the Irish brogue can get difficult to understand. And, like Ken, I do like the look, history and ambiance of Bruges, and I would like to visit that place sometime in the future.",In Bruges
72,jfgibson73,Fun While It Lasted,7,4 March 2017,"I think my expectations were built up too high for this movie--I kept hearing how amazing it was. It's a fine story with some great lines of well written humor, but it felt a bit like a Pulp Fiction wannabe. I think the biggest weakness is the ending. Having everyone just die isn't much of a resolution. It makes we wonder why I invested the time following these characters for the last hour and a half. Everyone in the movie did a great job. I liked Mad Eye Moody as Ken, even though I didn't buy him as a killer for hire. Ralph Fiennes gets to be the crazy crime boss, like the one in Sexy Beast, and he does it stylishly. Colin Farrell carried the lead just fine. I would have liked to have something to take away from my viewing rather than just have the movie stop, but it was fun while it lasted.",In Bruges
73,jaybob,This should be on many 10 best lists for 2008,10,1 July 2008,"Martin McDonagh a noted stage director & writer has fashioned this very original,dark comedy into one of the best films so far this year.NOTE on the script & the use of foul language. Normally I despise the excessive use of the 'F' word. In the script & the way these fine actors use them it seems natural & normal.Colin Farrell & Brendan Gleeson are 2 hit men hiding out (in plain sight) in the Medieval city BRUGES BELGIUM, they are waiting to hear from there boss superbly enacted by Ralph Fiennes. In fact all 3 actors could be nominated for acting honours at this years end.I must also mention the following players for there outstanding work,Clemencie Posey as a native lass of the city,She is new & a breath of fresh air, hopefully she will be in many more films.Also Jordan Prentice just about steals the few scenes he is in, He happens to be Dwarf & has great talent & promise as an actor.The entire production is first rate.NOTE,, Bruges dates back to the 12 th century & most buildings are many hundreds of years old. They seem very well preserved. (Gee Whiz, here in the good 'ole' USA,If a building is 50 years old its torn down & we do nothing about it.)Due to the language & subject matter as well as some violence at the conclusion I do not recommend this for children, ALSO there are NO CGI action scenes, It is a film with great dialogue between the actors, mainly between Farrell & Gleeson.DO NOT MISS THIS FILM . It will be high on most best lists.Ratings ****(out of 4) 98 points (out of 100) IMDb 10 (out of 10)_",In Bruges

Two Hitmen are sent to Bruges to lay low while things cool down from their last job. It's a simple enough story but every interaction, every line of dialogue is just gold here. There's not a bad performance, no lousy special effects, to age it, just great character development and interactions.It's weird at times and I imagine it absolutely wont work for a lot of people, it's very British and very vulgar, but for everyone else this is a simple, no frills movie that's absolutely worth the watch.

75,dierregi,"Bad copy of ""Sexy beast""",4,6 July 2008,"The plot in a nutshell: two hit men are ""hiding"" in Bruges, their boss is angry because one of them messed up his first job, some redemption and hope at the end. So far so good, apart form the fact that I was not specially in need of yet another Brit-underworld movie. However, the main problem with this one is that it tries too hard. It tries hard to be - at least - like two very good movies, such as ""The third man"" and ""Sexy beast"". It tries hard to be funny, cool and smart, failing miserably along the lines. It tries hard to make Bruges look like a place you want to visit (I have been there and I agree with the Colin Farrel's character - it is not, to put it mildly)The part where it tries to be ""The third man (in Bruges)"" is obviously the location and night scenes, but also the fact that the main villain is named Harry. Said villain is played along the lines of the great Ben Kingsley - the psycho you'll love to hate, which made ""Sexy beast"" such a good movie -.Ralph Fiennes tries too hard to upstage Kingsley, but he is never believable as the gang leader with a personality split between the psycho and the loving father. Kingsley is just unbeatable exactly because he was constantly over the top, with none of the mushy sentimentality of a good father. But the huge, black hole of the whole story is the attempt of making us believe that these criminals actually ""care"" about strangers. Unfortunately, there is no honor among thieves. If they are criminals it is exactly because they do not care about collateral damage, being it a pregnant woman, a harmless child or an elderly guy.Finally, it is extremely difficult to root for any of the characters. They are incredibly verbose, just go on and on with lines of absurd dialog; act in ways that are not consistent with criminal backgrounds and are simply very unlovable. Colin Farrell is supposed to be the nice ""bad"" guy but he is quite nasty, with serious anger-management issues which would suggest he is way beyond redemption. In a restaurant scene he hits a man AND his girlfriend, just because they complained about cigarette smoke. If that is acceptable behavior in somebody's book, is not in mine. I would object having my face smashed even by a good-looking thug like Colin.I am surprised by the good reviews, but maybe it is because I have been in Bruges and totally do not care to go back.",In Bruges
76,Spondonman,"Mad, manic and marvellous",8,16 September 2012,"I've always preferred watching ""old"" films - even when they weren't so old I preferred films made in the Golden Age to all those modern films made in the '60's. But I still occasionally try new ones out, usually to my disappointment or disgust but In Bruges is one of the great exceptions. I've now seen this a couple of times: how such seedy violent profanities can appeal to me still puzzles me, but there's no doubt to me that this is a brilliant film – with many faults, dazzling to watch. My daughter wasn't as impressed as me so maybe it helped not to be as used to modern movies or maybe it's just that you'll either love it or hate it.Two Irish hit men (Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson) hole up in Bruges - definitely not an excrement-hole – they don't know why except to await orders from their gangster boss Ralph Fiennes back in London. Farrell is mentally tortured by the recollection of accidentally shooting a young boy in the head. When the order finally comes to Gleeson it comes as a surprise to put it mildly. With everyone constantly swearing their heads off with some great lines, all bickering, taking the mickey, the story veering into very dodgy territory at times all depicted with a slapstick frankness, great photography/colour/sense of humour/style, editing and atmospheric music. So what if the denouement was a little contrived and telegraphed to the viewer well in advance, it all made perfect sense in a glorious black comedy. Favourite bits from so many: the opening sentences ""After I killed him ""; Farrell and the bunch of elephants interested in the church; the dismissive references to gay beers; the wingeing skinhead shot in the eye by a blank; Fiennes sorry for calling his wife an inanimate object; the wonderful meeting between Gleeson and Fiennes in the café, with so many side-splitting unrepeatable comments made or retracted; I really really hoped Farrell wouldn't die too. I never thought I could laugh so much at so much coarseness!It's fast and stylish, with beautiful Bruges at all times looking like it's from a effing fairy tale. Not recommended if offended by sex/violence/bad language/adult themes (as I very often am, but only in what it shows the film-makers think of their audiences) – however this is an eye popping work of Art, in my admittedly limited experience utterly unique and recommended.",In Bruges
77,onepotato2,Doesn't Work,3,31 March 2010,"I bought this DVD after viewing it once a few months back. I must admit my judgment was wrong. 'In Bruges' fails utterly to align its two conflicting urges; to be maudlin, and to be shocking. It's very amateurish. As an alternate take on the hit-man movie, it goes places the others don't, but it's not terribly interesting. It feels like a gay hit-man soap opera paid for by the Belgium tourism council (The voice-over intro which dispenses with the reason they're in Bruges in one line - before the movie even starts - is just pitiful). The two hit-men hug, they cry, they mope. I'm gay and this movie makes me squirm. It's about as much fun as watching two sulking gay guys pass the time while they iron out their relationship over a vacation. It's too elegiac and subdued to be much fun ...and too puerile to be much of a guilty pleasure.Author McDonagh revels in foul language but doesn't find much glee in it. And the movie becomes a clunky, ever more meaningless action-movie-cliché-machine for the last half hour. Post-'Sexy Beast' villains are all the same (Here it's Raelph Fiennes). The angry midget gag is stolen from 'Lost in Oblivion.'",In Bruges

Belgium has a reputation for being the most boring country on the planet and this movie fully explores that theory; though apparently (through proceedings) its actually not. Great cast, funny, thought provoking and moving. Certainly deserves all the plaudits from many film lovers and has become somewhat of a cult movie.
An excellent black comedy, thriller centered in the pretty part of belgium. fine acting performances all round and some very smart dialog; lifts this way above the average affair.

Bruges the city is beautiful and a medieval time-capsule, full of boats, canals, cobblestones and 'pointy buildings' as the midget says there. Gleeson, Farrell and Fiennes are all quite good, Fiennes is quite funny in a vicious limey way, while you find yourself rooting for Gleeson despite his day-job, you know? It's certainly a movie about some rather unpleasant people-hit men who snort coke, kill total strangers in cold blood, swear at one another 100 times a day and basically meander thru life. The midget is an angry racist, the girl is a coke dealing petty thief, and of course her bf is a 'lollipop man' who likes holding people up as well. He gets blinded for his efforts.I'm not sure if at least Some of this is meant to be a spoof-'this is the shootout'-some great lines all through--but it does play like one, at least a bit.You might wanna check it out if you don't mind some violence, a deeply cynical edge and unpleasant people doing nasty things in beautiful backdrop, Bruges Belgium.I liked it and do recommend.*** outta **** at least.",In Bruges

It's something about midgets.This is pretty good, although the absence of laughs felt awkward.What's with Colin Farrell's eyebrows? Like wind-wipers with a jammed motor.I would have enjoyed the contrast between his character and Gleeson's if they both had different philosophies. So the scene in the blood chapel was the crucial bit, but there was nothing outside their selfish concerns.I thought Bruges & Brueghel would inform the characters, maybe set a pattern for them to break, but the actors just reacted to each other like father and son.The love interest was pointless. The film-within had potential, but it just served what turned out to be a melodrama. Fiennes was good as an east-end gangster, but the best performer was Luke Kelly (bell-tower scene): ""- On Raglan Road on an autumn day I met her first and knew That her dark hair would weave a snare that I might one day rue; I saw the danger, yet I walked along the enchanted way, And I said, let grief be a fallen leaf at the dawning of the day.""",In Bruges

For a while there I thought this was another Woody Allen movie - this time with humor -and humor abounds in here. However this is a serious drama that just happens to have some very good lines and, of course, acting. Timing is everything and it shows up in here all over the place. I cannot relate some of the good lines because some Language is associated with many of them. Oh, because I said Ray and Ken are assassins, please don't think this is another Bourne movie. No, this is rather slow, but very engaging. If truth be told, you will be sad to see it end. BTW, Bruges is in Belgium.Violence: Yes.

His mate Ken, an excellent Brendan Gleeson,, is more stoic, dependable, and has seen it all.What lifts this is not only the script by playwright and first time director Martin McDonagh but the deadpan delivery and wonderful sense of comradeship.Without a doubt one of the better films about hit men of recent memory - better than Matador et al - due to a stonkingly good script and lots and lots of little touches and surprises.

Lit beautifully by Eigil Bryld.But all of this was not enough to sustain the beginning of a pretty good story line to the end. It just got murkier and murkier along the way until I just didn't know what kind of movie it was trying to be. Drama? Comedy? Noir? Slash? One of my hated clichés in ANY movie is the corpse that just won't die. You know the type, shot, knifed, thrown from high building, bleeding copiously in all directions but the damn thing keeps spewing out advice or death-beddy bon mots while climbing messily to great heights gushing and smearing blood everywhere. Without spoilers, this film had a surfeit of such clichés. I groaned again and again. And again.Colin and Brendan, playing hit men Ken and Ray, shine in a slowly developing relationship that is foisted upon them by their boss. There are some funny bits. One gets invested in the characters. A few twists and turns to the plot follow. Not all successful.Ralph Fiennes, for once, is a little over the top as the head of the hit organization.

85,sme_no_densetsu,A decent crime flick but nothing particularly special,7,21 December 2008,"""In Bruges"" is a crime flick like so many in recent years that explore the lives and moral dilemmas of criminals. In this case, the film centres on two hit men holed up in Bruges, Belgium after a hit gone wrong. When it becomes apparent that someone is going to have to take the fall questions of right and wrong are raised.The cast is a pretty good one with Brendan Gleeson & Colin Farrell working well together. I give the edge to Gleeson in the acting department but that may be because Farrell's character is rather unlikable (at least initially). Ralph Fiennes also turns in a good performance as their menacing boss and Clémence Poésy amply supplies the eye candy.The script is better than average but I wouldn't rank it alongside the best films of this type. It's got much of the same flavour but it just isn't as memorable. Overall, the storyline is pretty satisfying though it surprises me to see this film classed as a comedy.The technical side of things is ably handled but not particularly notable.In the end, this is a worthwhile film if you're looking for something along the lines of ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" et al., except with more depth. While I think that this film lacks the indefinable spark that makes the best of those films appealing it is nevertheless a fairly unique spin on similar material.",In Bruges
86,dunmore_ego,Quentin Tarantino's THE ODD COUPLE.,10,17 August 2009,"Humor so black and ironic, it's like stabbing nuns with the same ruler they used to rap your knuckles during piano lessons. IN BRUGES. It's in Belgium.It's where mismatched hit men Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) are sent by Harry the Boss (Ralph Fiennes) to lay low after a hit, to await his phone call for their next step.Like a Guy Ritchie version of Laurel and Hardy, Ken embraces the touristy élan of the picturesque Bruges (pronounced ""Broozh""), while Ray turns his collar up against the cold and bitches about waiting around with nothing to do.A telegram arrives from Harry, which uses the f-word as noun, verb, adverb, adjective, qualifier and preposition. Which lets us see into the tender soul of the man. Ralph Fiennes as uber-cockney Harry the Boss, is a cross between the ferocity of Daniel Day Lewis in GANGS OF NEW YORK, the rarified unculture of Phil Daniels in QUADROPHENIA and the unmitigated rape-clown cuntery of Ben Kingsley in SEXY BEAST. Though Fiennes was also ferocious in SCHINDLER'S LIST, his character there was not tempered with any humor - here, Harry's pure evil hits you like a rubber chicken to the temple. An evil rubber chicken.While Ray is on the town making time with some tasty Euro blondness in the form of Clémence Poésy, and befriending a dwarf (Jordan Prentice) with a penchant for tall hookers, and generally getting into another fine mess with his A-type personality, Harry phones Ken with the next hit: Ken has to whack Ray.Ken refuses. So Harry must travel to the fairytale city to get the job done himself. As this journey towards doom progresses, we see into the crazy, twisted principles of all these men - and they are not unlike the best in all of us, with the worst tacked on to allow them to do their jobs.While trying to shoot down Ray, Harry is blocked by the pregnant hotel owner, whom he does not simply kill, instead, asking her to move aside courteously, telling her, ""I'm not going to go through you and the baby - I'm a nice person!"" Harry then makes a deal with Ray that he won't shoot at him until he runs outside. They both them agree on which direction to run.At the height of its darkness, there is shocking levity - IN BRUGES is actually laugh-out-loud funny. And brutally sad: Ken meets a disturbing end in sticking to his principles and trying to save Ray from Harry's vengeance.IN BRUGES is such a seamless, effortless shock to the system, you'd never realize this was only writer-director Martin McDonagh's second directorial effort; with its lightning dialog, intertwining plot and symbolically heavy themes.On their touristy travels, Ken and Ray encounter Hieronymous Bosch's The Last Judgment, something they can both agree is evocative and disturbing. Bosch symbolism appears throughout the film, with Ray's dwarf friend and a Mardi Gras street fair playing a pivotal role in the film's surprising, gut-wrenching finale.Carter Burwell has such a knack for music score that spanks the nerves at just that right crossroads of pathos and humor; evidenced so brilliantly in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, now here, in this same type of crucible where darkness and levity collide.Take a holiday from the Hollywood humdrum. Visit IN BRUGES. Bring a gun.---Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",In Bruges
87,seymourblack-1,"Crime, Comedy & A Point Of Principle",9,11 August 2016,"""In Bruges"" has a plot line that comfortably accommodates a number of seemingly incongruous elements as well as producing some neat twists. Its mixture of crime, comedy and action is immediately appealing but as it develops, it's also enriched by the eccentricities of its characters and the sharp dialogue that brings them to life so effectively. As an added bonus, the action is set in the beautiful Belgian city that provides the movie with its stunning backdrop as well as its title and the action is cleverly paced to accommodate both character development and the delivery of some entertaining action sequences.Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are a couple of Irish hit men who are sent to Bruges to escape the fallout from their last job which went very wrong when Ray unintentionally killed a child. All they know is that their stay could last up to two weeks and that they need to remain on standby to receive some further instructions from their crime boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes). The two men are very different as Ray is young, excitable and a complete novice at his job whereas Ken is older, more experienced and has a much calmer disposition. Ken adjusts immediately to their predicament and takes the opportunity to enjoy some sightseeing but Ray is completely unimpressed by his new surroundings and is impatient to leave again as soon as possible. Ray's also consumed with guilt about what he's done.Ray's attitude starts to soften, however, after he sees a film crew at work one night, and becomes fascinated by a dwarf who's one of the main actors in a dream sequence that they're filming. To add further enjoyment, he also meets Chloe (Clemence Poesy), an attractive production assistant and makes a date with her. Their friendship soon becomes very eventful as their date ends with Ray beating up an unpleasant couple who were sitting near them in a restaurant and discovering that Chloe is actually a drug dealer whose sideline in the past has been to seduce tourists so that her ex-boyfriend Eirik (Jeremie Renier) could rob them.When Ken eventually receives Harry's telephone call, he's surprised by the assignment that he's given and prepares to go ahead as instructed. Things don't go according to plan though and so Harry feels compelled to travel to Bruges himself and this leads to the story's surprising climax which proves to be deeply ironic, wonderfully absurd and perfectly fitting for this very black comedy.For his directorial debut, well-respected playwright Martin McDonagh has come up with an exceptional story that's totally unpredictable and juxtaposes tragedy, comedy, remorse, violence and pathos in ways that are quite original and unexpected. His characters are extremely well-drawn and there's an innate quirkiness about the whole undertaking which makes the movie continuously stimulating and funny to watch.Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are marvellous as the two hit men as they bring out their individual characteristics so vividly whilst also displaying, through their banter, how well they work together and function as friends. Ralph Fiennes also makes a huge impact with his nicely over-the-top portrayal of the scary sociopath, Harry.",In Bruges
88,Angelus2,Not everyones cup of tea,9,10 November 2009,"Two hit-men arrive in Bruges, Belgium after a hit that went bad...Hiding out in a town that isn't the most liveliest; there way of life is called into questioning.Colin Farrell is an actor that I didn't pay attention to very much until I saw him in 'Miami Vice' and since then I've seen interviews were he seems to exude a charming and interesting personality. And here displays his acting skill once again.I found the film to be quite slow at first but then you begin to fall for it's dreary charm and realise it's quite funny. I thought the casting was done brilliantly bringing in Brendan Gleeson, Colin Farrell and Ralph Fiennes; each adds something unique and wonderful.The little town gives the film a darker tone, which makes it 'a fairy tale' as Ken would say.Brendan Gleeson plays the hit-man with a taste for the finer things in life , beautifully giving the hit-man character a warmth, while Colin brigs a nervousness; having to battle his emotions constantly...Ralph Finnes is simply dazzling as the real 'ard cockney gangster.I kind of figured out the ending when 'Harry' mentioned what he would do himself if he ever took the life of a child.All in all, an film with amazing acting, script writing and comedy.",In Bruges
89,antoniotierno,good humor and location,7,1 September 2009,"The movie is mainly a black comedy, quite British, has very witty dialogs to and fro and a few twists as well. Set in the wonderfully preserved Medioeval city of Bruges it's also an intriguing mix, well executed, of situational humor and existential dread, and gets also to balance light and dark. ""In Bruges"" is undoubtedly clever, as well as properly acted and written (I had the impression it didn't quite know how to end after its best scene, more or less in the middle of the movie). In my opinion it's certainly to recommend for this look into how criminals' personal codes of honor and ethics get in the way of their jobs. Plus its original location adds surely something more to the story, although this peculiar genre has already been populated with other good examples of funny and storytelling.",In Bruges
90,areatw,Decent entertainment once it finally gets going,6,23 January 2018,"'In Bruges' has a lot of glowing reviews and an average rating that puts it up with the some of the best films of 2008, but I can't say I share the same enthusiasm for it. Firstly, even though dark humour is usually my thing, I didn't think 'In Bruges' was particularly funny. The constant crude language, especially from Farrell's character, was more irritating than humorous and didn't feel natural at all, and neither did the character's constant whinging.The second half of 'In Bruges' is a lot better than the dull and directionless first half, in which the two characters do little more than wonder around the city complaining about anything and everything. At least we get some action in the second half, though it only partly recovers what it a disappointing spectacle. 'In Bruges' isn't bad once it finally gets going and the humour will probably appeal to some people, but I was disappointed.",In Bruges
91,ElijahCSkuggs,Surprisingly Sensitive and Funny,8,9 April 2008,"Whenever I went to the theater, no matter the movie, In Bruges would be one of the previews. Truthfully, not being a big fan of Colin, I was getting very sick of seeing it. But after hearing all the good word, I decided to buck up and check it out. And damn, this was a real good flick.Story focuses on two hit men who are sent to a beautiful and culture rich city in Belgium, known as Bruges. They're both to stay put in Bruges and keep a low profile until they hear word from their boss, Harry.Bruges is a gorgeous, quaint looking city with canals and cobblestone roads. One would think anyone would love to spend time here, but this isn't the case with this odd couple. The two men both share a profession, but not tastes. And this is where some really nice humor plays in. One appreciates life, the other not so much. The story focuses on why these two see life in different manners which really gives the film some great character development. And this is where the movie shines best. In it's two leading men and their banter with one another. From just talking about beer or how silly something is, to serious issues of death and the afterlife. It's all very entertaining which makes the movie move at a fast clip.Like any other flick with Irish actors, you've got the silly observational type humor, the thick as a brick accents and the motormouth way of speaking. It's all good, but I have a tough time hearing/understanding them quite a bit. If you're like me, this is just a warning to keep your ears open.In Bruges was a surprisingly good flick with great performances by the two leads and two supporting actors being the characters Harry and Jimmy. The others, like Ray's girly, were nothing special. She really just felt like a model thrown into the mix. Besides that, anyone who enjoys a well-written flick, a little blood and some taboo themes should definitely check it out.",In Bruges
92,jaredmobarak,You got to stick with your principlesIn Bruges,8,23 February 2008,"I think that I will shortly be purchasing the Oscar winning short film Six Shooter from 2004. I've got an iTunes gift card for just the job. The thought occurred to me after seeing the wonderful debut from director Martin McDonagh, In Bruges. After seeing the trailer, which really worked for me, many times and wondering at how it is from an Oscar winning director yet never hearing of the name, I did some research. While he already has more little gold men than Alfred Hitchcock, his actual feature premiere is what has opened this weekend. It is Irish, most definitely, and if you have trouble with the accent, maybe you should steer clear until in comes out on DVD, however, if you can cope, this is a smart pitch black comedy. When I say pitch black, I mean black hole expanse of darkness. The trailer leads you to believe it will be an uproarious time, and while it is very funny and very smart, there is a tragic event that is held over the proceedings, lending a somber shadow over all that occurs. In the end though, it is consistent with its wit and drama, telling an intriguing story and never relying on the laughs to hide any plot point that the creators may not have wanted to work out to completion.If I am to gripe about anything, it will be the ending. Not the very end, however, as that is absolutely perfect. The camera-work, voice-over, and final shot cannot be argued, it is the climax that happens just before that rings false. It is the only moment like that, though, so I don't hold it against the film. McDonagh needed a way to get his characters to their arc's conclusions and if that means turning one of the roles, at first seeming to be there for jokes, into a pawn for a symmetrical kind of convenience, I'll give him that reprieve. As far as fitting with the story, yeah it works; it has to because the incident is alluded to unknowingly at many times during the course of the sightseeing romp. I guess I think it fits too well and wish McDonagh could have come up with another way to do it.Besides that, though, In Bruges is a great time at the theatre. Colin Farrell is steadily becoming a favorite of mine with his precise comic timing and broad facial expressions. I may be one of the few people on earth that loved his comedic turn in Woody Allen's Cassandra's Dream, (yes I truly believe the comedy was intentional), and here he shows it was not a fluke. Kind of similar to his scene-stealing role in Intermission, he is a punk with a lousy disposition and disregard for tact. Here, however, he also has a conscience. This tug-of-war is ripe for laughs as he is a sweet guy, he just doesn't know how to keep his mouth shut. One-liners are in abundance and you will be laughing continuously. Brendan Gleeson helps this fact by being an effective straightman to play off of. He knows the score and tries to enjoy the ""fairytale"" city while his cohort sulks and puts on ""moods like a five year old"" because, honestly, unless you grew up on a farm and were slightly retarded, Bruges is really just hell on earth. (Actually, the city looks pretty great and I wouldn't mind checking it out once in my lifetime.) The periphery roles, and there are many, also add depth and interest to the film. Small characters like Eric Godon's alcove loving gun dealer, Jordan Prentice as a horse-tranquilizer taking midget actor (he played Howard the Duck, that is awesome), and Clémence Poésy as the love interest and enigma Cholë all are fun and never quite feel just thrown in as jokes, but instead integral parts to the story. Of course, the great Ralph Fiennes is involved too. His accent and vocabulary rivals Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast and unfortunately is a much smaller part than anticipated from the trailer. Well maybe not unfortunately, because if he was in more it might have become a gimmick. I also couldn't help stop thinking of Harry Potter with Mad-Eye Moody, Lord Voldemort, and Fleur Delacour all involved.I highly recommend this film for anyone looking to see a good drama with comic overtones. Don't go in thinking this is to be a total good time, with laughs a minute, there is so much more to the tale that you may not expect or necessarily be hoping for. At times it is very dark and drains every molecule of happiness out of your heads, but thankfully a good joke or line will be coming shortly to alleviate the depression.",In Bruges
93,hall895,A fairytale town...but this is no fairytale,7,30 March 2013,"Bruges. It's in Belgium. And after a job gone wrong two Irish hit-men, Ken and Ray, are sent there to hide out. Their boss loves the place, calling it a fairytale town. Ken becomes a happy tourist, embracing the chance to explore the best-preserved Medieval city in Belgium. Ray is not happy. He wants out of Bruges from the moment he gets there. Touring a Medieval city is not his thing. And it also becomes very quickly obvious that Ray is tormented by something. The film is very smart in waiting to reveal exactly what it is that is weighing so heavily on Ray's mind. When all is revealed a new spin is put on things. The story, which to that point had seemed to be an odd couple comedy, takes an emotional turn. But the film never stops giving you plenty to laugh at. And when Ken and Ray's boss reveals exactly why he sent them to Bruges the film turns again, giving us some action, drama and real suspense. But still laughs too. Always laughs. The film has serious elements but at heart it's always a comedy. A very dark comedy. And a very good one.Much of the credit for the film's success has to go to the actors portraying Ken and Ray. Brendan Gleeson is perfect as Ken, the older and wiser of the pair. And Colin Farrell is excellent as young hothead Ray. Farrell is hilarious in Ray's biting exchanges with Ken about the merits, or lack thereof, of Bruges. But Farrell also nails the serious, emotional side of the character. Gleeson and Farrell really do make for the perfect screen pairing. It helps that they have a great script to work with, writer/director Martin McDonagh providing them with plenty of hilarious dialogue all along the way. The starring pair are also ably supported by some other performers. Ken and Ray's boss is not revealed until well into the picture and when he arrives things really kick up a notch. This guy is explosive and, in his own unique way, hilarious. There's a woman involved, she's about the only thing in Bruges which Ray finds appealing. Oh, there's also a cocaine-snorting racist dwarf with an affinity for hookers.In this film the city of Bruges itself is just as important a character as any of the people. What a lovely city, and director McDonagh shows it off beautifully. It may not be Ray's thing but chances are you'll want to visit the place after seeing the film. And you'll probably want to see the film another time or two as well. It's a dark comedy which gives you plenty of laughs but it has a great deal of heart as well. And some good action too. It's wonderfully scripted, performed perfectly by a great cast and it looks spectacular. Well done by all involved.",In Bruges

95,sharky_55,It's like a f*cking fairytale,9,20 June 2015,"The first thing you realise about In Bruges is that it's a very good tourist advertisement for the city. It's almost too easy for the set designer; lavish old churches amongst medieval architecture, cobblestone streets, gorgeous canals, a dainty market square. Beneath the beautiful setting is a dark and twisted comedy that manages to say quite a lot. Irish playwright Martin McDonagh's dialogue is at times reminiscent of Pulp Fiction's, being snappy, cynical, often irrelevant. But it's very important in establishing the relationship between two hit men in Ray and Ken.Farrell gives a wonderfully nuanced performance as the younger of the pair. The opening narration tells us of his cardinal sin in murder, but it's much later that we find out that he also accidentally killed an innocent young boy in the process, and that it was his first contracted kill. Farrell manages to portray these without ever explicitly telling the audience. His performance is one of great range and character; on the surface he is bored, impatient, brutally dismissive, honest (that American did have a heart attack at the top of the tower), and cynical. But there's also moments of innocence and wonder and childhood that he exhibits which makes it more clear the gravity of his situation and sin. At heart Ray is not a bad man, simply one on the wrong path. Ken (Brendon Gleeson) is the only one who recognises this. There's not too much in common with the pair; snappy exchanges showcase the very apparent difference between the two's idea of a good holiday and just a waste of time. McDonagh manages to give a visually breathtaking and interesting tour of Bruges all while establishing the relationship and the plot. They discuss heaven, hell and purgatory at the art museum, a thin veil for the hit men's pondering of morality, and clash when Ray refuses to go up and see the view at the bell tower while Ken pays his 5 Euro. Each scene of the tightly knitted screenplay is crucial to the climax of the film, every last detail significant. There's a running motif between the criminals of the film in the pair and their boss, Harry. Ralph Fiennes plays a calm but unbalanced mob boss, unflinching in his duty but all the same possessing a moral compass like the other two. McDonagh expresses this with humorous dialogue which is driven purely by character. Both Harry and Ray are impulsively violent when need be but in sight of the pregnant Marie, their softer personalities come out. It's a clever and almost exasperating scene which wouldn't normally be in a film, as they time the start of their action sequence in unison. There is clearly a line that even these men won't cross. Ken reaches this with the realisation of Ray's impeding suicide, despite initially agreeing to kill him as a result of his debt to Harry. It's a wonderfully ironic twist which again is driven by wonderful acting and dialogue: ""I'm not allowed to and you are? How's that fair?"" All three characters possess an underlying complexity beyond just the simply criminal life of killing people. Ken doesn't even commit any murders in the entire film; in fact only killing himself in an attempt to save Ray. His life debt, trust and integrity to Harry is undone when he realises that the reasonably untainted Ray has the capacity to be something better. No more prominent an example of the code that they possess is Harry's suicide at the end which hammers down the main thematic virtue. The sort of innocence and purity that is symbolically represented in the boy and seen in glimpses of Ray must remain clean of bloodstain and ruin. Harry kills himself when realising what he's done; ironically the victim is the very opposite of the ideal, a drug addicted dwarf who hires prostitutes. The significant act is in Ray, who frantically tries to correct this act and spare Harry even as he is dying by his hand. Ray's characters progression is complex, foreshadowed and consequential. Even whining endlessly at the beginning at being stuck in Bruges for two weeks, he shows no real purpose, desire or destination. His ambitions are simple and sensual in nature: chasing after a beautiful women and stealing drugs. This aimless perspective is marred by the sincerity of the guilt at the back of his mind, showcased sparingly but in raw and genuine moments of emotional regret by Farrell, like when he breaks down at the playground. In the ambulance he finally decides on a goal: to find the mother of the boy and accept her punishment. It's the first time in the entire film we see resolve to live and it's the culmination of the hints of moral goodness that we know Ray is possible of. The ending is purposefully ambiguous on whether he does manage to reach that goal, much better than the one in the original screenplay which has him contemplating suicide once again only to hesitate when Chloe rings him. For Ray, the fairytale city of Bruges is a complete nightmare. It's a 2 week purgatory which constantly eats away at his conscience and reminds him of his guilt. One way or another, he must escape. In Bruges manages to deftly balance the light-hearted humorous side of the situation and of the characters with the subtext of self-hatred, anguish and cardinal sin. It's a thematically complex character study filled with stark juxtapositions of the poignant and the absurd. Most will find it as charming as the fairytale city that it is set in.",In Bruges
96,aciessi,Pack your Bags,9,25 June 2015,"Looks on the surface to be a typical English dark comedy/thriller in the vein of early Guy Ritchie. Watch it, and experience something absolutely phenomenal. I beg you, don't let this one pass you by. In Bruges is painfully hilarious, and painfully sad, at the exact same time. Imagine crying through your tears.. yeah, it pretty much sums this movie up. It uses it's criminal characters to observe the delicacy of life, and the excruciating consequence of one horrible mistake. Yet, these characters are so tragic, that when they go for a laugh, you're roaring. Laughter and sadness intertwine so well, isn't it a mystery why?",In Bruges
97,fwomp,In Hell? Or In Bruges?,8,4 August 2008,"How do you make the story of a hit-man who accidentally blew a hole through a child's head funny and light? It ain't easy, but IN BRUGE does it on several levels.You definitely have to have a main character who can pull off something both dramatic and comedic. And that someone is Colin Farrell (MIAMI VICE), a killer who finds he's having trouble living with the accidental death of child who got in the way of a bullet.Then you have to have a great co-star, and he turns out to be Brendan Gleeson (KINGDOM OF HEAVEN). Gleeson has been a favorite star of mine since his American portrayal of Sheriff Keough in LAKE PLACID. His combination of dramatic chops mixed with witty line delivery made him the perfect choice for this role.You've also gotta have some sort of tryst going on, and there's actually several of those. The primary is that of Ray (Collin Farrell) and Chloë (Clémence Poésy). Their brutal honesty with each other makes for some interesting mental sparring between the two and has some of the lighter moments within this otherwise dark dramedy. The other is that between Ken (Gleeson) and pregnant Belgium hotel owner Marie (Thekla Reuten). Ken's distant manner opens up to Marie during certain film segments, and Marie's stunning good looks and prideful appearance make her a person to be reckoned with. Another mini-tryst comes thanks to a film being produced ""In Bruges"" where one of its stars named Jimmy (midget Jordan Prentice) is out to have a good time with whatever women he can find (or drugs).Normally location wouldn't necessarily play that important of a role in a movie like this that is truly a character study of dark people who are also genuinely decent in many ways. But Bruges, Belgium IS important. After Ray (Farrell) accidentally kills the small boy, he and Ken (Gleeson) are told to ""get out of town and head to Bruges."" For Ken, it's like a vacation; the stunning buildings and peaceful waterways put Ken in laid-back mode. But Ray is tense, on edge, and sincerely depressed at his accidental shooting of the small boy. The two clash as soon as they reach Bruges, and their differences are mirrored in the landscape around them: swans, steeples, guns, and prostitutes.There's also a comparative study going on between a famous painting of Hell in Bruges, Belgium (that Ken and Ray check out), to that of the movie being filmed in town by Jimmy (Prentice) and that of the experience Ken and Ray find while visiting this quaint, Belgian community. I won't say more for fear of giving away too much.The final bonus for movie watchers is checking out Ralph Fiennes (THE CONSTANT GARDNER) as the overly-scrupulous death dealer Harry Waters. He's a family man with a mob-boss mentality who must head to Bruges himself in order to set things right. And once he's there things really heat up! Bullets fly. Bodies fall from tall buildings with resounding *splats!* And he finds himself the victim of his own moral code in the end. Nicely played.A warning should probably be given to those who are squeamish or don't care for the overuse of foul language. Both play out significantly in the film, but they are also integral to the characters and the life they've chosen. But you can't say I didn't warn you (the R rating is definitely deserved).What's more interesting to me now, though, is that I would LOVE to see Bruges in person. The extra features on the DVD include a boat trip through the canals of Bruges and point out incredible spots of interest. An added bonus, for sure. I just hope I don't see any cloaked midgets or men with silencers running around.",In Bruges
98,Benjamin-M-Weilert,"A fantastic first film in the ""McDonagh trilogy.""",9,8 March 2019,"It's interesting to see Martin McDonagh's first film with the hindsight of his two other movies. While I missed In Bruges (2008) back when it came out, I have recently enjoyed Seven Psychopaths (2012) and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017). Having now seen all three of McDonagh's films, I see the themes and motifs he uses throughout his directing. I already had hints of these common elements; it's just that seeing In Bruges for the first time has cemented them. From using short people to drug use to some uncomfortable violence, McDonagh has a style all his own, and it clearly shows in his breakout film.I think what draws me to McDonagh's films is his expert use of multiple ""Chekov's Guns"" as well as tying all these various foreshadowings together in a satisfying way. Whether it's a fat American, spare change, or the untimely death of a child, each part of In Bruges was included for a purpose that becomes evident in some truly genius twists along the way. Some may say that the ambiguity of the endings of his movies is frustrating, but I almost like the open-ended conclusions that seem to say ""and life goes on.""While I did enjoy In Bruges, it still had some areas where McDonagh eventually improved through his continued filmmaking. Even though they spoke English, half the time, I couldn't understand what was being said by the actors. This almost caused me to turn on closed captions for some semblance of ""subtitles."" Other than that, the dark comedy helped to balance the deeply dramatic plot as it centered around death in its many forms. I was already a fan of McDonagh's films, but In Bruges helps to confirm that the McDonagh trilogy is one of the best pieces of filmmaking to happen in the last decade.A fantastic first film in the ""McDonagh trilogy,"" I give In Bruges 4.5 stars out of 5.",In Bruges

Two Irish hit men (Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson) get up to no good after being sent to the Belgian city of Bruges.The film is a darkly comic, scabrously witty farce that takes a puerile glee in being casually offensive. The result is great fun, until it starts taking itself seriously. But it's a laugh-out-loud dark comedy.

So why aren't I rating it a full ten? Because while I like black comedies, and this definitely qualifies as one of the best, it was just too grim for me, at least on the night I watched it. Everything about this movie is really great, but it is really black, and not in a playful or tongue-in-cheek way, but in a very dark contemplative fashion. The comedy is pretty good but only interspersed here and there, and is not a dominant part of this movie. Without a doubt this is a superb movie, but it is essentially a serious, sort of philosophical movie with a fair amount harsh and realistic violence. As long as you know what you are getting yourself into, you'll likely enjoy this movie, but be forewarned, it is much more black than comedy.",In Bruges
101,petra_ste,Like Tottenham,5,5 September 2015,"There is something to admire about In Bruges. It's a black comedy, which is the hardest genre to make, as it comes with all possible pitfalls of both humor and drama. It's ambitious in themes and symbolism. The script makes an ingenious use of set-ups and pay-offs: every element or character introduced in the first half has a relevant consequence in the second - a sort of Chekhov's armory.And its premise is intriguing: killers Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Gleeson) hide in Bruges after a botched assassination, waiting for further instructions by their boss Harry (Fiennes). Ray is fuming with boredom and irritation; older, pensive Ken enjoys the atmosphere of the enchanting medieval town - until Harry orders him to kill Ray.Writing in this movie has something of a cult following. Humor is subjective, but I found it hit-and-miss. See, the problem isn't the amount of jokes about gays, blacks, yankees and dwarfs (the latter turned into a painful running gag); Tarantino, for one, thrives on this politically incorrect stuff - except he is actually funny, has a point to make and a gift with words this script doesn't display. Smug cynicism is mistaken for humor; we are supposed to laugh because a man child is obsessed with ""midgets"". You can wax philosophical, portray Bruges as a sort of purgatory, fill the movie with imagery straight from Bosch... but, after the fourth dwarf joke, your lofty ambitions scrape against your facile humor - it wasn't that funny even the first time, McDonagh. See a confrontation between Ray and Harry when a pregnant woman angrily stops the armed men waving guns in her hotel and, when they agree to go kill each other outside, quips ""You people are crazy!"". This isn't ""deep"", it's a sketch. Confront it with another aborted Mexican standoff - the one at the end of Pulp Fiction, which had humor, tension and the affecting musings of a man rethinking his life.Ray, who has the central arc, is unbelievable: a killer who acts like a goofy 10-years-old and switches between moping for his hatred of Bruges, pursuing a local girl (Clémence Poésy) and feeling devastated for accidentally shooting a kid. That's not a character, it's a coat rack for a writer's unused ideas. More coherent and interesting is Gleeson's melancholic Ken. For the definitive black comedy about anti-heroes dealing with honor, karma and atonement, watch Pulp Fiction. For more light-hearted crime comedies, good picks are Guy Ritchie's Snatch and Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang - and, for a straight-up comedy about neurotic killers, Richard Armitage's Grosse Pointe Blank.What's odd is, McDonagh's following (and better) movie Seven Psychopaths is the opposite of this - a paper-thin premise, but a script which is actually amusing.5,5/10",In Bruges
102,gregsrants,All over the place,4,4 March 2008,"I headed into my screening of the new Colin Farrell/Brendan Gleeson film, In Bruges wanting to like the film as much as any film I have travelled a distance to experience this year.I am one of the few that think Farrell's interviews over the years have been far better than any of his performances, but Gleeson is someone that I have admired since he stole a few scenes from Gibson and the gang back in 1995's Braveheart.Putting the two Irishmen together in a film ripe with violence and humour was as welcomed into my day's itinerary as that favourite uncle that always came to the house bearing gifts.But when the full experience came to a close, I was left feeling like I opened up the gift only to find a rattle rapped inside a knitted sweater.In Bruges stars Farrell and Gleeson as Ray and Ken, two hit men hiding out in the Brussels town of Bruges after Ray's first assignment suffers some collateral damage. The two couldn't be more opposite. Ken is the elder, father-like figure that would spend his days traveling the city and taking in the historical sites and buildings. Ray, is the cynical partner (and comic relief) that prefers to chase skirts and head to the local pub for a pint or two of local lager. Together the two are Frick and Frack. Murtaugh and Riggs. Lee and Carter.With not much going on in the small town, the two seem to squeeze their entertainment value out of the locals thanks to large consumptions of beer, some cocaine and quirky acquaintances that provide leisurely distractions to both Ray and Ken as they await further instruction from crime boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes). Particularly small man Jordan Prentice as Jimmy. As a midget on location in Bruges shooting a dream sequence in a film, Jimmy provides all the laughs that don't come from Ray's adolescent behaviour.The fun and games take a turn for the serious when Harry orders Ken to off Ray as punishment for the hit that resulted in complications. Unfortunately, this is also where the film turns predictable. You know just know that Ken is not going to kill his apprentice Ray and that Harry would end up having to come to town himself to rid himself of now two problems.And this all takes us to a bloody finale that should have been more fun that its conclusion and more satisfying than its ending.I definitely cannot fault the writing via a screenplay from director Marin McDonagh who at one time had more Oscars (with one) than Martin Scorsese. When Ray utters such non-politically correct phrases as ""If I'd grown up on a farm and was retarded, Bruges might impress me, but I didn't, so it doesn't."" I could imagine Farrell and Gleeson sitting around a script reading table laughing uncontrollably over the audacity of the lines that are played with quick witted precision in front of the camera.But the film from top to bottom confused me and left me bouncing off the walls trying to figure out what type of film it was trying to become. It started off with the black humour and utter ignorance of a Payback, then went into a Lethal Weapon buddy/buddy film only to change pace and go incredible serious leading up to the final chapters that were more bloody than most of the horrors I have seen in recent weeks.For all that, I cannot give In Bruges a recommendation. It is one of those few films that I do expect to watch again on DVD and I hope I can be swayed into seeing the film for the individual parts even if they don't flow together cohesively. But in the meantime, I recommend that you don't go to Bruges, but you stay at home and do a virtual tour on the internet instead.www.robertsreviews.com",In Bruges

Wonderfully impossible to classify, it ranks right up there with the best of the Coen Brothers' blackly funny crime romps like FARGO, BLOOD SIMPLE and THE BIG LEBOWSKI, yet swirls in the best parts of Guy Ritchie's ""geezer"" films as well, with just a dash of existential angst for flavor. Mature, sanguine Ray (HARRY POTTER'S Brendan Gleeson) and his hot-headed yet soft-hearted protégé Ken (a fantastic Colin Farrell) have been ordered by their boss to spend a few days cooling their heels in the picturesque, Medieval city of Bruges in Belgium, after an ""assignment"" they were taking care of backfires in a completely horrific way. Oh, did I happen to mention that the two buddies are hit men, and that it's Ken's actions that fouled up their latest ""job""?The two men's polar opposite reactions to this quaint European city tell so much about the characters, and both actors take every opportunity they've been given and run with it. Gleeson, who's done everything from horror (28 DAYS LATER), to comedy (THE SNAPPER) to a combination of both (LAKE PLACID) shines here as the seasoned vet, and Farrell, who's had a real tough time picking projects that make the most of his considerable talent, has never been better. Against this postcard-ready backdrop, like a rumpled, modern-day answer to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Ray and Ken ponder the ironic finality of death, the perplexing puzzle of life and what their part in it really is, and how anyone could (or could not) spend their lives living in ""f***ing Bruges"". While they wait to hear from Harry, their boss (the excellent Ralph Fiennes, who doesn't show up until halfway in, but blows us away when he does), they while away the time sight-seeing and sampling the local beer. A movie shoot taking place in the town square figures prominently, as the movie pokes fun at itself with wry and refreshing self-awareness. A beautiful local girl named Chloe (Clemence Poesy) and a dwarf named Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), both connected in their own way to the movie-within-the-movie, figure prominently in the events that occur later that affect both men in a way that both shatters and surprises.Irish playwright Martin McDonagh wears both writer and director hats here for the first time, and both fit him like a glove. The dialogue is very realistic, with just enough whimsy to delight the audience and define the characters without being too clever or precious about it. And the dark, bitter ending offsets the movie's earlier sweetness just right...sort of like really good Belgian chocolate, like the kind I'm sure you can get...IN BRUGES. Kudos to everyone involved for producing a marvelous piece that feels independent but not contrived.",In Bruges
104,Danusha_Goska,Cheap Trick to Sell Stale Dialogue,2,19 October 2008,"""In Bruges"" has two things going for it: a tender, poignant performance by Colin Farrell, and Bruges itself, a city most of us don't pay much attention to. Other than that, the film is derivative and almost empty  I say ""almost"" because it does have some content, and that content is vile.Colin Farrell used to be the next big thing, but that hasn't panned out, and he's made a lot of small, independent films like this one. I hope his next movie offers him a script worthy of the acting talent he reveals here.Bruges is a city in Belgium with lots of extant medieval structures and museums dedicated to medieval masters like Jan van Eyck and Hieronymus Bosch. ""In Bruges"" just shovels Bruges on the screen; no art is exercised. There's no special lighting or setting or marrying of the film's themes or dialogue to unforgettable images of Bruges, its structures, paintings, or swans. ""In Bruges"" doesn't do for Bruges what a Woody Allen film does for Manhattan or any number of movies do for Paris.Outside of Farrell's performance and the city itself, ""In Bruges"" is a rip-off of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Sexy Beast."" Rather than John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson as talkative hit men, you get Farrell and Gleeson. Rather than Ben Kingsley in a contrary-to-type role as a vicious crime lord, you get Ralph Fiennes in a contrary-to-type role as a vicious crime lord. Fiennes is surprisingly uninteresting and not at all scary here.For the most part, you get Gleeson and Farrell strolling around Bruges, trading low key, banal observations: Americans are fat, racist, and kill John Lennon and Vietnamese, beer is good, medieval art is deep. These observations are larded with the F word. So effing beer is effing good and effing medieval art effing is effing deep and effing Americans effing are effing fat effing. Oh, and since Gleeson and Farrell are Irish, and Irish people are inherently cuter and more interesting than anyone else on the planet (this movie thinks) their banal, F-work larded comments are all the more valuable.And, of course, every twenty minutes or so the screen is spattered with blood as another character dies.You get the idea.Here's the thing  the director and script writer, the inherently cute and smart (because Irish) Martin McDonagh, doesn't know anything at all about crime or hit men or how bodies react to bullets. McDonagh doesn't even know the make of the guns he shows on screen.But McDonagh knows that he'd never be able to sell a movie about two Irish accountants, say, or two Irish sanitation workers, or two Irish school teachers, strolling around a poorly lit (because this is a low budget movie) Bruges trading banal observations about how effing wonderful effing beer effing is, so he makes his characters hit men, and, voila, suddenly everything they say is ultra fascinating, or funny, or profound, in a way that it would not be had they been common working slobs.This could be called the Big-Mac-in-France trick. In ""Pulp Fiction,"" two hit men discuss the naming of fast food hamburgers. It's an incredibly banal conversation. The only reason the movie's largely teen male fans love the scene is because they believe the men having the conversation not to be John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, but two hit men, and hit men, teen boys think, are glamorous and inherently interesting, and so their comments about Big Macs warrant careful attention.Putting banal, shallow dialogue into the mouth of an imaginary hit man who bares no relation to real life hit men in an effort to make his dialogue sound profound has got to be the cheapest trick in the book. Arthur Miller managed to make Willy Loman, a traveling salesman, the most fascinating character in the world  through Miller's brilliant writing. A great, or even competent writer, doesn't have to make his character a hit-man to make his words matter.",In Bruges
105,ajs-10,Good fun... But with a dark side...,8,20 March 2011,"This is, again, a film I have seen before and, again, I took more out of it on a second viewing. This one seems to cover all the bases; drama, romance, comedy, thrills; it's got the lot to varying degrees. The first time I saw it, it was the comedy that stood out; this time I was more struck by the drama of it. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please take a tour of Bruges while I write the next paragraph).Two hit men, Ray and Ken have been sent to lie low in Bruges (Belgium, for those that don't know where it is) by their boss, Harry, after a bungled hit. They check into their hotel only to find, to their dismay, that they will be sharing a room. This does not go down well, but it's near Christmas and everywhere is fully booked. The two men are complete opposites, Ken is quite cultured and is happy to go sightseeing in the medieval city. Ray, on the other hand, is much younger and would be happier spending his time in a bar. Ken insists they do some culture and Ray acts like a bored teenager. That is until he discovers a film crew who have a dwarf in the cast, he is fascinated with Jimmy. There he also meets the mysterious Chloe, who he invites out on a date. That evening Harry calls and tells Ken the real purpose for their visit. I will leave my summary here so as not to enrage the spoiler police too much.I think the Bruges tourist board will be very happy with this film; the medieval architecture comes across beautifully. The cinematography is great and the setting adds real atmosphere. Great performances all round, particularly from; Colin Farrell as Ray, Brendan Gleeson as Ken and Ralph Fiennes as Harry, all were excellent. Honourable mentions also go to; Clémence Poésy as Chloe and Jordan Prentice as Jimmy, both were very good.As I said at the beginning, there is a lot of comedy in this film, it's mainly in the things Ray says and does. Few films make me laugh out loud, but this one did in more than a couple of places. The drama comes mainly in the final third and I found it didn't quite have the impact it might have done. I guess the comedy reduced the force of the dramatic conclusion, although by then the comedy is very, very dark. The ending, I felt, was a little bit of a let-down, I expected something much bigger. But over all, a very enjoyable film with some laughs, excellent cinematography and some great performances Recommended.My score: 8.1/10",In Bruges
106,jem132,"Terrific comedy-tragedy, with great work from Gleeson, Farrell and Fienes",9,20 September 2008,"I really enjoyed this one, a terrific comedy-tragedy that features great performances from it's three central players, a sharp script and gorgeous location shooting. The plot is pretty simple: two Irish hit men hide out in Bruges after a job. It would be a shame to give away any more plot spoilers, because it's such a fun ride. This is my type of humour, and the film is amazing in that one moment it has you laughing your head off, then less than 10 seconds later you are struck silent by the emotional depth or poignancy of a single line. Case in point: the scene in the children's playground. First-time director Martin McDonagh masterfully steers this film around the beautiful city of Bruges, a setting cleverly juxtaposed with the action. Farrell hasn't been in such good form for ages, and he and Gleeson have great acting chemistry together. Fiennes is also great as the ruthless crime boss who is also a man of principle. While the ending is maybe just a little too cute, this is still wonderful film-making.",In Bruges

The acting was great Ferrel did an excellent job. And the way they mixed the comedy with an intense story I just loved it. The humor was actually really funny too.After hit-man Ray kills the wrong person during a hit his boss sends him to bruge to lay low and ease off some of the guilt of killing the innocent person.This movie was really good. It was a fresh interesting idea and it was hilarious and at the same time it was really brutal.,In Bruges
108,CountZero313,Bruges will never look the same,7,24 November 2008,"Poor old Bruges. I've never been there, but the name of the town will now forever evoke the collocation 'shithole' in my mind.Ray and Ken are two assassins sitting in out in Bruges after a botched job. ""Why Bruges?"" asks Ray. Why indeed, the answer becoming clearer as the opening banter gives way to a darker undercurrent.Colin Farrell has never been better, playing the dumb-but-deadly Ray. The humour, though not always successful, is daring at times. Delightfully, the film makes no attempt to pander to an American audience. Delicate souls from the The States might come out of this one chest-thumping. Farrell's courting of a local film PA sets up most of the comedic moments, along with his reluctant mentoring by Gleeson. When called upon to provide some deeper emotions, Farrell rises to the occasion with aplomb.Gleeson, who has quietly built an incredible CV that includes Braveheart and Gangs of New York, is as dependable as ever. When the boss charges him with a repugnant task, his inner turmoil is all-too-evident.Both men, so used to acting in foreign accents, clearly revel in the exchanges in unadulterated Irish English.The casting of Ralph Fiennes as London hood Harry Waters is less successful. Fiennes appears late in what appears to be almost a cameo, but the holding back of his presence is somewhat undercut by featuring his visage prominently on the poster. His performance is too derivative of Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast, and comes across as poor parody. He does share one of the films best moments with Gleeson in the pavement café, in a heated discussion revolving around an insult to his kids. But his character arc is forced, and his demise far too contrived, telegraphed as soon as the dwarf appears in school uniform.The running gags about dwarfs committing suicide, and the fighting prowess of the Vietnamese, are fresh and inventive. Gleeson and Farrell pitch their odd couple routine to a tee. In Bruges is both funny and moving and is not to be missed.",In Bruges
109,Superunknovvn,"Fine, subtle comedy",8,18 May 2008,"I love Focus Features. They have really become a trademark for fine little quality movies. ""In Bruges"" is yet another one of those. I wouldn't have expected too much from a Colin Ferrell movie, but Ferrell is as great as the movie itself.""No movie classic has ever been made in Bruges"", a character explains at one point and that can be seen as a bit of a cocky announcement that ""In Bruges"" was going to be the first movie to change that. While writer/director Martin McDonagh didn't deliver a full on classic, ""In Bruges"" is bound to become connected to that beautiful fairy tale-town for quite a while.While cast, script, direction and score are all very pleasing, it's the ending where McDonagh takes some wrong turns. Suddenly the plot becomes implausible, characters motivations are unbelievable and mindless chase sequences take over. It's not enough to ruin the movie, but it keeps ""In Bruges"" from becoming a genuine masterpiece. Having said that, McDonagh's film is still this year's first really memorable and original sleeper. Way to go, Focus Features!",In Bruges

Things change for Ray when he meets Chloe, part of a film crew shooting a movie starring an American dwarf named Jimmy. When Harry's instructions arrive, Ken, for whom the job is directed, isn't sure if he can carry out the new job, especially as he has gained a new appreciation of life from his stay in the fairy tale Bruges. While Ken waits for the inevitable arrival into Bruges of an angry Harry, who feels he must clean up matters on his own, Ray is dealing with his own issues I've really liked Colin Farrell but who knew he had such a good sense of comedic timing? There is a running gag involving fighting with a bottle, and karate, that he manages to keep fresh as it pops up throughout the film. Brendan Gleeson's character provides the moral center and plays the straight man to Farrell's Ray. This works well as the movie turns more serious towards the end. However, for my money, the best performance is delivered by Ralph Fiennes who plays Harry the pair's criminal overlord back in London. Whereas Gleeson character embodies the moral center, Fiennes's Harry fills the role of principled immorality, plays the straight man to Farrell's Ray. This works well as the movie turns more serious towards the end. However, for my money, the best performance is delivered by Ralph Fiennes who plays Harry the pair's criminal overlord back in London.

Fiennes creates a character with a dubious moral center and is a quite believable figure of Shoot first. Sightsee later. After seeing the trailer, In Bruges looked like a plodding British comedy with little originality and repetitious humor, hence the low expectations. Yet, In Bruges exceeded my minimal expectations, and, unlike my impression from the trailer, was an original drama with good acting and a nice blend of comedy mixed in. It was funny in the right places and appropriately dramatic when the story shifted into high gear towards the end. The another aspect of the film worked for me was Ray's love interest. Early in the film he manages to woo Chloe, a drug dealer with, drum roll please, a heart of gold. For my tastes, the budding romance comes across more as a vehicle for jokes and drama. But it's a small thing and I doubt anyone but me would notice. I intentionally left a lot of plot points out, because, as I've mentioned, this film surprised me in a good way and I don't won't to ruin it for anyone else.In Bruges is a good film.

111,jucsetmai,In Bruges on 4k ultra hd,9,30 January 2021,"It's on my short list of favorites, but I guess it's a bit dark for a lot of viewers. There's a tendency for people to compare this to funny films, but I associate it more with dreary, antihero movies. Despite the comedic parts and some uplifting moments, it's a serious story about a murderer coming to terms with his immorality whilst stuck in a real life purgatory. It's in my retiring assassin holy trinity with The Matador and Grosse Point Blank, films I re-watch often to restore my dwindling faith in humanity. The awful, main characters in those films at least come to terms with their past and try to be good, which is more than can be said about most people.A bit of an aside, but if anyone's in the mood for a story somewhat like this that's not funny at all, I recently enjoyed Killing Them Softly.

115,rajdoctor,In Bruges,7,19 July 2008,"It was six months back when I went to Bruge and it fascinated me by its beauty  lovely place. On BBC, when I saw the discussion of this new movie  In Bruges, I found it interesting. I saw the trailers, and that too appealed me  as is based on an interesting premise. Two hit men  elderly Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and young Ray (Collin Farrell)  are ordered to hide in Bruges by their Boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes), because Ray along with a priest, by mistake killed a young boy  and other gangs are behind them to seek revenge. The only way the thing can be resolved is to kill Ray. Harry asks Ken to kill Ray, who is suicidally depressed. Ken wants to give Ray another chance. Harry gets angry and comes to Bruges. The final show-down results in lots of gun-shots, blood and death of most of the protagonist.This is a dark comedy thriller movie. Writer-Director Martin McDonagh, who had won an Oscar for a short film  Six Shooter in 2004, comes back with this wonderful movie. He has this uncanny style of narrative- where he infuses dark comedy and racism slurs  with penache. And the style is felt in every frame of this movie. Even in the darkest and grimmest scene  Martin manages to keep audience gay  with the dialogue and style. The writing / story / screenplay are the kings, and Martin takes out brilliant performances from his perfecting casting.Brendan as Key, masterly enacts this role of loyal hit-man and a compassionate friend. Collin Farrel is just outstanding in his role of this innocent, eccentric, dry humored & silly guy  who is also a cold blooded murderer, with a conscious. Ralph Fiennes  since Shakespeare in Love, has grown in stature and maturity in his characterization of roles.The musical score is Carter Burwell and cinematography of Bruges by Eigil Bryld are excellent.There are also other characters in the film, who are real to the groove and have given top class performances.Though comparable with Tarantino dark humor and style, I think Martin has his own genre of telling the story. I hope he continues giving us such lovely and enjoyable gems.Those audience, who do not like talkative movies or movies that show blood in cold shots  stay away from it. Others, go and enjoy this wonderful flick.Just a trivia, I went to see this movie with my work colleague Claudia Misch, and met other two colleagues - Lena and Guido. All four sat together and enjoyed seeing this movie.(Stars 7.25 out of 10)",In Bruges
116,WriterDave,"""They're Filming Midgets...""",9,16 February 2008,"...in Bruges. Two Irish hit men (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell) are sent into hiding by their British boss (Ralph Fiennes) in Bruges, Belgium after a botched job only to learn that the most damning job awaits one of them just around the corner. Bruges is a picturesque tourist trap built around the oldest and best maintained medieval city in Belgium. Director and screenwriter Martin McDonagh bleeds the setting and the material for all its worth and makes his feature film debut in superb style.The dark comedy built around the existential quandaries of hit men has been done to death over the years. If last summer's ""You Kill Me"" was the relentlessly dark and relentlessly sitcom-y take on the genre, then ""In Bruges"" is the hipster art film take on the theme. McDonagh deserves all the credit in the world for breathing life into the stale story by texturing the tonal shifts with crisp digital camera-work (that is surprisingly haunting), deep character development, and by creating a wonderful sense of place. Imagine a Graham Greene novel (""Brighton Rock"" specifically comes to mind) modernized by David Mamet. The dialog is super smart and wickedly un-PC while the comedy parts are as gut-busting as the crime thriller parts are suspenseful.McDonagh has also brought together an outstanding cast who thrive in the material. Farrell defies all odds and manages to be as sympathetic in the dramatic parts as he is charmingly sarcastic in the comedic parts. Brendan Gleeson gives a fantastically nuanced portrayal as Farrell's mentor and friend. Meanwhile, Ralph Fiennes channels the scary-as-hell energy he's used previously in ""Schindler's List"" and the recent ""Harry Potter"" films in a limber subversion that is a frighteningly fun to watch. The supporting cast is to die for, with Jordan Prentice spot-on as a coked-up dwarf actor shooting an abhorrent art film on the streets of Bruges, and Clemence Poesy coyly seductive and unforgettable as Farrell's unlikely local love interest.Ultimately ""In Bruges"" meanders down too many cobblestone paths, and one scene near the end involving a bell tower stretches credibility but adds necessary dramatic effect. Certain plot elements will turn off a large segment of the viewing audience. However, those with the right mindset will be greatly rewarded. ""In Bruges"" is hilarious, contemplative, sometimes scathing, often nihilistic, but marked by a shockingly hopeful undercurrent while tones shift and the colors of the human condition undulate in McDonagh's insightful light. The arrival of a commanding talent has been heralded...in Bruges.",In Bruges
117,Eumenides_0,Hit men With Consciousness,8,8 September 2009,"Two hit men travel to Bruges after a botched hit. Ken, the older, more mature hit-man, sees this as an opportunity to visit the beautiful Medieval city and all its cultural artifacts. Ray, the young hit-man, is going crazy and can't wait to get back to the 'real world'. But they can't movie until they get a call from their boss, the mysterious Harry.This simple premise provides Martin McDonagh the room to create a blend of comedy and drama involving a drug-taking dwarf, obnoxious turists, a neo-Nazi and his girlfriend who rob turists, prostitutes, Bosch imagery and the beautiful city of Bruges. Through all the dark humor emerges a captivating movie about the importance of principles, the ability to change, sacrifice, regret and responsibility. Quite a tall order for a hit-man movie, but McDonagh pulls it off with delicacy and excitement.I don't remember a dull moment in the movie, one that didn't have something to hold the viewer's attention, whether it be the witty dialogue, the slapstick humor, or just the shots of Bruges.Much of the film's quality comes from its Oscar-nominated screenplay. But the three main characters each contributed a good deal to the wonder. Colin Farrell reveals some talent for humor and even drama, when need be. Ralph Fiennes continues to reward viewers with his intense performances. But the real star, the actor who should have won the Oscar for best supporting role last year but wasn't even nominated, was Brendan Gleeson. I haven't seen him in such a complex and promising role since The General. And it's obvious the role excited him because he gave one of his best performances ever, playing a middle-aged hit-man fed up with death trying to do some good for people at last, even if it costs him life.I gave this movie the pass when it came out, and much regret it has caused me after watching it on DVD.

118,SquigglyCrunch,"Super Funny, Well-Paced, and a Lot Deeper than Expected",9,26 January 2016,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie. The plot sounded really funny, and I'm happy to say that it didn't disappoint. In Bruges has an interesting plot. Two hit men are sent to await orders in the city of Bruge after killing their last target. The only thing is that Ray, the main character, hates Bruge. It goes deeper than that, but I don't want to spoil anything. The plot is good and thankfully Martin McDonagh knew what to do with it. The characters end up being one of the major driving forces of the movie. Ray himself goes a lot deeper than expected. Despite this, the movie never takes itself too seriously. Ray's always got something to whine about, and it's great fun to watch. The other characters are good too, but Ray especially. As mentioned above, the movie is very funny. It's a comedy though, so you'd hope so. But the jokes, while random and weird, still make sense in the context (for the most part). They aren't just random noises or phrases, they actually fit, which is nice. The movie is paced quite well too. Despite pulling off a 107 run time, not a whole lot happened thinking back on it. But it never felt rushed or too slow.Overall In Bruges is great fun, while still managing to stand as a great film. It's funny with great characters, a great plot, and great pacing. It's all around just a great movie. I'd recommend this movie to basically anyone, so long as you have a good (and a little dark) sense of humor.",In Bruges

Instead of one dimensional killers - the film shows them to be three dimensional with fears and guilt and hope and decency and love - just like anybody. Gleeson is a wonderful character actor and gives a tremendous performance here - Farrell is also a pleasant surprise - when he is usually put into the leading man roles I find him rather boring but he's powerful here as the naive, jump first =think later criminal.

121,andrewroy-04316,"While some witty moments in the script help, In Bruges feels lacking in meaning and extreme in absurdism",5,1 March 2019,"In Bruges feels like a pitch for a bizarre, darkly comedic and British version of The Departed. Unfortunately, it's not particularly successful. The best parts of it are its effective comedic moments - McDonagh's wit is evident throughout the script, and keeps enjoyable scenes that would otherwise be dull and pointless. I did feel that the comedy was more a series of individual funny moments than consistently being amusing throughout, and its elements outside of comedy were disappointing on the whole. The acting is pretty good, but the plot felt more like absurdist commentary than actual substance. While their basic character traits are obvious from the start, we don't get a deeper understanding of why they are hitmen or much nuance in their relationship. The movie centered on how terrible Bruges is, but I didn't think Mcdonagh actually gave us a sense of the city (it certainly didn't come alive or show me anything, beyond what the main characters claim about it and seeing some tourists), which is a serious flaw for a movie that focuses so much on the setting. The first two acts were lacking in energy or things happening, and the third had a fun performance from Fiennes (especially the scene when he called his wife an inanimate object and apologized, I loved that) but veered completely into the absurd and provided no closure or satisfaction. Yes, it comes full circle as Harry shoots him and in the process accidentally a kid, and he kills himself as he said he would, but that was not making any point or tying up any theme and instead just showing repetition with a flipped perspective for humor and absurdism. The scene in the hotel where they gamify the death felt most silly to me and confirmed my distaste for the film overall. The characters all die in pointless and somewhat self- inflicted ways, so maybe McDonagh is trying to make a nihilistic point wrapped in a big joke about Bruges, but I was certainly hoping for more than that and didn't find it.",In Bruges
122,MartinTeller,In Bruges,6,30 December 2011,"A film that reaches for both profound redemption drama and Tarantino-style comic banter and falls short on both accounts. On the comic side, there are maybe a few clever bits but most of it is stuff from the same old bag of gags, with a few homophobic lines thrown in for good measure. It fares slightly better with the drama, although Farrell (who I can't stand looking at... those freak eyebrows and tiny mouth... it's amazing I like THE NEW WORLD as much as I do) doesn't really go through a transformation so much as he keeps shifting back and forth between dickhead and swell guy. We're asked to accept Gleeson as the sage, soulful elder hit-man but even though I liked his performance, the character feels manufactured. Also the ending is possibly the lamest example of dramatic irony I've ever seen. You could almost hear McDonagh quietly and smugly chuckling to himself as he thought of it. The cinematography and score are pretty good, and I really did enjoy Gleeson, but otherwise I didn't dig this very much.",In Bruges
123,markovd111,A depressing but purifying and beautiful movie!,10,5 October 2019,"The movie is slow. It's not an action movie and it's not dynamic. It's, for a bigger part, a movie about friendship, sins, our deeds and consequences that follow. Performances are good and memorable and the soundtrack is brilliant, though you may not notice it at first. It all starts to feel like some sort of a dream very soon when you start to understand the messages movie is sending. Humor is black and at the times very fun, thus making the movie less of a pain to make through and giving it style. And, as the movie goes, you begin to understand. Bruges, in this movie doesn't represent a dreamlike place. Or better yet, it does. But it isn't heaven. Nor hell. It's that one in between. A purgatory. I give it 10/10, but I recommend it to you only if you are in mood for a depressing movie which will make you think about it's story and try to analyze it. And I recommend bringing a friend for a ride. It's easier that way...",In Bruges
124,rajatdahiyax,Awesome Dark Comedy!!!,9,13 September 2014,"Bruges, the most well-preserved medieval city in the whole of Belgium, is a welcoming destination for travelers from all over the world. But, for hit men Ray and Ken, it could be their final destination. A difficult job has resulted in the pair being ordered right before Christmas by their London boss Harry to go and cool their heels in the storybook Flemish city for a couple of weeks. Very much out of place amidst the Gothic architecture, canals, and cobbled streets, the two hit men fill their days living the lives of tourists. Ray, still haunted by the bloodshed in London, hates the place, while Ken, even as he keeps a fatherly eye on Ray's often profanely funny exploits, finds his mind and soul being expanded by the beauty and serenity of the city. But, the longer they stay waiting for Harry's call, the more surreal their experience becomes, as they find themselves in weird encounters with locals, tourists, violent medieval art, a dwarf American actor shooting a European art film, Dutch prostitutes, and a potential romance for Ray in the form of Chloë, who may have some dark secrets of her own. And, when the call from Harry does finally come, Ken and Ray's vacation becomes a life-and-death struggle of darkly comic proportions and surprisingly emotional consequences.",In Bruges
125,pfgpowell-1,Whimsical and touching,7,5 July 2009,"In many ways, In Bruges is something of a little gem. It is marketed as a 'dark comedy' and it is, indeed very funny if you like dry wit and irony and enjoy seeing the world through the eyes of two Dublin men who have rather inexplicably been ordered to leave London and lie low in an obscure Flemish town. That these two men happen to be killers is initially neither here nor there. They could — or, at least, Brendan Gleeson, as the older and more mature hit-man could — be just like any two tourists you might meet seeing the sights of a beautiful medieval town. Colin Farrell, the second, younger hit-man, is not at all enamoured of Bruges and sightseeing, and his lack of sophistication is typified when he memorably describes history as just a load of stuff that has happened. Where in Bruges is not something of a little gem is when it is reluctantly forced to abandon the Irish whimsy — one of the central conceits of a hit-man taking time off to relax and enjoy a spot of culture is nothing if not whimsical — and begins to plod down the more familiar paths of film-making convention. Thus the various whimsical strands of the story all come together in a rather neat finale, which is, unfortunately too neat to be satisfying. The writer/director Michael McDonagh can't be blamed for that, and as this is only his second feature — and his first full-length feature — his handling of the techniques of film-making is outstanding. So far he has written plays for the stage, and in many ways In Bruges is still a play which has been transferred to the big screen, and that is not meant in a derogatory way. The dialogue is naturalistic and, at times, exquisite. But in a sense In Bruges is still a play in that McDonagh wants to deal with rather big themes: conscience, guilt, a sense of honour, loyalty and revenge, and what might have worked well on stage finally doesn't work quite as well on the screen. Although oddly both the Gleeson and Farrell characters are rather likable despite the fact that they have killed without mercy for money, by the end of the film they don't quite ring as true as they did when we first meet them. Similarly, despite Ralph Fiennes's character being established as a sadistic crime boss without heart or feeling, his final honourable act is also wholly unconvincing. So where does that leave us? Well, because in so many way In Bruges is the excellent side of good, the reservations I make are rather ungenerous. My point is that because so much of the film is very good, it sets itself such high standards that when, in just a few respects, it doesn't quite meet those standards, this apparent 'failure' stands out all the more. Let me be clear: In Bruges is streets ahead of many other films which masquerade as 'comedy' or 'thriller' or 'drama'. In hindsight there are one or two niggles such as the implausibility of the Farrell character being discovered and arrested on a train leaving Bruges, the way that various characters conveniently bump into each other, and, it has to be said, the implausibility of some of the characters' motivation. But at the end of the day these are minor points. In Bruges stands alone and has an identity all of its own. I do, however, suspect that whether or not you enjoy In Bruges will largely depend on what kind of films you otherwise enjoy. Yes, there is a chase at the end, and, yes, it all ends in bloody, murderous violence, but these elements to not define the film, if you are the kind of moron who values so much of the dishonest, quick-cut, super-slick, in-yer-face mush which keeps the cinema cash tills ringing, you would undoubtedly feel your attention and interest flag long before the guns are fired. If, on the other hand, you have the wit and taste to watch a story unfold (however implausible that story might finally be) and enjoy the kind of Irish dry humour which is not in-yer-face, your will enjoy In Bruges very much.",In Bruges
126,gsygsy,Hilarious,7,21 August 2013,"Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) in this movie might be seen as a mordant response to the Tarantino's pairing of Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson)in PULP FICTION. Two mismatched hoodlums, more emotionally attached to each other than they initially suspect.The story of IN BRUGES becomes more surreal as it moves to its climax, a progression that for me doesn't quite come off - perhaps it needed more swirling mists and arty camera work a little earlier than the writer/director opted for. But this slight misjudgment doesn't ultimately detract from a hilarious script and excellent performances.Special mention to Carter Burwell: another superb score.",In Bruges
127,diac228,"If you can't laugh at a man being blinded in one eye by a blank, then this isn't for you",6,25 May 2009,"2008 had two high-profile crime time comedies that blended action with suspense and a hintage of good ol' European humor. On one hand, we have the slick Rockn'Rolla that brought Guy Ritchie back into the spotlight, and now we have a new-school director delivering one of the most unique hit-man films in a very long time. In Bruges is one of those rare examples in which the comedy is so bleak, so dark, it can barely pass off as humor depending on the viewer. Marketed as a quirky action comedy; this film doesn't match the genre in the least bit. Instead we have a deep character study that focuses on the moral implications of the main characters, as they tour around a beautiful yet overlooked city. It's definitely not everyone's cup of tea. The film itself is interesting and fleshes out a clever story; but never quite gets off the ground, never quite propels itself to become a highly entertaining film. Then of course, we have the indie ending.In Bruges follows two hit men that must lay low after a mission went horrifically wrong. While Ray (Colin Ferell) soaks in the bitterness and guilt over his murder, Ray's partner Ken soaks in all the beautiful scenery and curiosity of the area. They both become well-acquainted with the place, meeting all sorts of characters. However, things become complicated when their boss (Ralph Fieness) has a new job for one of them. This is the debut feature-film script and directorial effort by Martin McDonagh as he crafts a good tale that has the same style of dark humor and tense action as his acclaimed short film from years ago. Originality is all over the place in this film, as dark humor is a tough genre to sell and deliver; it's rarely ever done successfully.The film is a delightful character study about people's actions, reactions, and the codes they must follow. Irony and subtle humor is also heavily present, as the mere premise of two murderous hit men touring around a secluded town like tourists is sure to tickle the funnybone. The script also calls for sympathy towards our anti-heroes, which is definitely a hard task that McDonagh tackled with ease. Helping the writing is superb acting by Ferell and Brendan Gleeson. If they don't interest you, Bruges certainly will. Bruges is basically a character in the film, as it adjusts and alters the mindsets and morality codes of our assassins. Beautiful scenery and nice cinematography makes In Bruges a travel documentary with a fictional story attached.However, the dark humor in the movie is a bit too dark. The movie can barely classify as a comedy because there's so much tension, so much violence, and so many heavy themes. A few chuckles will occur, but it's offset by the bitter humor that leaves you cringing at times. In Bruges in other reviews has been described as ""Irish humor."" If that's the case, Irish humor is definitely not my cup of tea, as its comedy is disguised in heavy drama.Bottom Line: A nicely written and acted film, marred by so-called ""comedy."" The humor comes off as bitterly dark and sometimes even dwells into the outright bizarre. If you can handle the dark chocolate-like taste (the 85% cacao bean kind), then you are in for a treat. The story is unique, so are the characters and situations they are involved in. This just might be American mainstream's first taste of Irish flavored film-making in years, and you can whether enjoy the flavor or move on. While the movie itself isn't amazing, this new-school director deserves a bit of attention for a strong first effort. In Bruges: a documentary with bullets and bodies.The food there looks good though.",In Bruges

129,rowmorg,Another embarrassingly awful British flick,1,30 October 2009,"Take an inauthentic theme (British ""hit-men"") and a ludicrously inapposite location (Bruges, Belgium), add an unconvincing love interest, and cook with a preposterous villain, and you get In Bruges. This film does not know whether it's a comedy or a tragedy, and works as neither. It breaks the solemn movie law by having no hero, and all its characters are thoroughly unlikeable. It is the quintessential entertainment made ""by those who can do nothing, for those with nothing to do"".You can see how the basic idea could have tweaked the money-men's interest: three British psychopaths cause mayhem in quiet, picturesque Euro-town. Sadly, it reinforces all the ugly stereotypes of UK soccer thugs, refusing to speak the language and trampling over the locals. There's even a rude joke-situation about Canadians, just for good measure. So that's the basic package: buy it if you like it.There's no point in going into the script: it's meaningless. The love interest is a lobotomised and marginalised figure, so women forget it too.The main character (no way he's a hero), played by Colin Farrell, is supposed to have shot a child accidentally, and his partner is to execute him for it, something he never dreamt of. As in the rest of the film, there is no police presence around the killing, a thoroughly childish aspect of this boyish venture. Bruges has been chosen by their boss (Ralph Fiennes, who should have known better) because it will give the victim a little view of fairyland before he dies. The mawkish sentimentality is not just the Fiennes' character's, it is also that of the director, Michael McDonagh.If it is not enough to have polluted the world to a wasteland, we have men dishing up this kind of mindless rubbish in the cinemas and on television.

She said, about some other movie, that, for reasons of clarity, it should be entitled ""Beware! Very, very boring!"" Very true, and very applicable to ""In Bruges"". I was at least as bored by the story as Colin Farrell's character is by medieval architecture. In fact, ""In Bruges"" is so boring that you wonder whether it was funded by the Flemish Board of Tourism. The movie only picks up some speed when Harry arrives on the scene. Cast against character, Ralph Fiennes plays a fast-talking mobster with a heart of gunpowder and a quirky code of honor. Minor perks include local lassies like Clémence Poésy (in the part of Chloë) and Thekla Reuten (as a hard-headed innkeeper). The one thing that makes the movie stand out despite its many flaws is Carter Burwell's music. But it feels strangely out of place in a movie so devoid of depth and drama.

At its core is the superb performance by Colin Farrell, proving yet again that he is one of the finest actors of his generation (check him out in Woody Allen's ""Cassandra's Dream"" as well and you'll see what I mean). A perfect blend of comic timing, rough charm and vulnerability - it's a knockout performance. And that's not to diminish the work of Brendan Gleeson, Ralph Fiennes or any of the other cast members - even the bit part players are terrific. Best not to say too much about the plot, as it's better to see it with fresh eyes - but Martin McDonagh deserves to be showered with awards for his work as both writer and director (and it's his first feature!).

On the face of it, In Bruges has classic Noir overtones, but this is played for laughs, although some questionable racial undertones and some extreme violence often break the comedic tone, giving the film an overall quirky feeling. The film never fails to surprise or entertain though, it has a freshness which makes it quite appealing.

135,Okonh0wp,Good Black comedy,10,11 January 2009,"In Bruges is a black comedy whose idea arose from a vacation writer/director Martin McDonagh took to the pristine town of Bruges, Belgium. McDonagh reflected in the DVD featurette that he was in awe of the town's medieval beauty but had the simultaneous feeling of being incredibly bored after two or three hours. He took these two disparate feelings and split them up over two characters. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleason are a pair of hit men who are paid by their boss to go to Bruges for an undisclosed assignment. They are supposed to pose as two tourists and maintain a low profile while waiting for a phone call. Ken (Gleason) takes an interest in the sights of the town and jollily obliges, while Ray (Farrell) is very bored. He is somewhat of a cultural boob with low intellectual curiosity but he gets more likable as the film progresses as we slowly see that he starts to develop a curiosity about living a better life. He is also bored because he has just accidentally shot a boy and is coping with guilt over that. Ralph Feinnes also enters in the story a little later as the enigmatic boss. The film is also populated by the kinds of characters that come with small-town comedies: An obnoxious Canadian tourist, a pregnant innkeeper, an alluring coke dealer (who Ray falls in love with) and her unfortunate boyfriend, and an opinionated midget.The film reminds me of Analyze This or Anger Mangement in that it features a star (Robert De Niro or Jack Nicholson in the above examples) making fun of their screen personas. Colin Farrell is playing to type in an extreme sense, reflecting his public image: Shallow and mostly interested in booze and women. (In real life, Colin Farrell is an avid reader and student of history who would be the kind of guy who's interested in a place like Bruges, but I digress). It's an interesting mix of genres but as is the staple of this genre, the black comedy, there are usually meaningless deaths. I won't spoil what happens but I grew close enough to these characters that I came to hope that we wouldn't be seeing anything bad happen to them.The film also has an interesting and curious romance between Ray and the coke dealer. She seems to give him a lot of chances but it turns out that she has a dark side to her as well.The dialogue was really good and it was clearly an engaging film but a pet peeve of mine in the dialogue is that everyone talks the same and uses the f-word in every sentence.

Writer and producer Martin McDonagh already has a distinguished pedigree as a playwright, ""The Lieutenant of Inishmore"" being perhaps his finest work to date. When some playwrights bring their craft to the big screen they fail to grasp the possibilities that a space beyond a stage offers them. With McDonagh, he brings the best of the intensity of the stage to the screen.The storyline is simple, two hit men flee London after a job to Bruges, and await instructions.Played by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, the first hour is an absolute joy.They talk, they reflect they discuss in a manner very reminiscent of Travolta and Jackson in Pulp Fiction.Intermittently very violent the film oozes restraint making the bloody outbursts even more shocking.A perverse gunman's morality also underpins everything which passes.Ralph Fiennes has great fun as ""Godfather"", Harry in a role which acknowledges that played by Ben Kingsley in ""Sexy Beast"".As is the hallmark of most playwrights, the story has a ""proper"" end and is all the more satisfying for it.With Tarrantino and Ritchie seemingly spent forces at the moment the field is open for the likes of McDonagh and the Coen brothers to blaze a trail for 21st Century crime capers.At just over an hour and a half the film also displays a rare discipline as the viewer quickly learns to soak in each setting and each exchange of ""badinage"" , so little is wasted.As of early May, my favourite film of 2008.",In Bruges

Ultimately psychopathically vicious, treacherous, and murderous but....""let's have big fun with it by making bloody murder and psychopathic hit men funny in the beginning before we get down to the real cruel blood and guts at the end""...... more or less a tired copy of one of Tarantino's films like Pulp Fiction, and it was mostly a one trick pony commercially calculated to depict sick but marginally entertaining segments of contrived and cruel human behavior including all the violence, blood and suffering an audience could stand for 2 hours without turning theaters into vomiteriums. The worst aspect of this film was that it shamelessly copied others in this genre who have done a much better job of it, like Tarantino, Peckinpah, and Scorcese. In Bruges was two disparate films tacked together.....the first one was a goofy, near Monty Python sketch of a forced stay in Bruges, Belgium by two joking and wise-cracking hit men sent there by their head man to cool off after a botched assignment in the UK, and the second part was a cruelly vicious and bloody version of a typical Peckinpah/Scorcese/Tarantino film of terminal comeuppance and payback for treachery and nearly limitless earlier sins. The two film parts and the character's actions in each part did not match well and thus the result looked contrived and uneven overall and appeared to be done by one who has a lot to learn about what makes a film good, and that includes consistent characterization that he did not well control. And, it does not include shamelessly copying a story style done better many times in the past 40 years and essentially pretty worn down by now.So, to me there was little substance that was interestingly new or different here. Instead, go see No Country For Old Men for this story genre done as well as it can be done. But, Bruges did look like a nice place to visit.",In Bruges
139,jackasstrange,Best comedy film of the last decade,9,27 November 2013,"In Bruges is perhaps the funniest and also the smartest comedy film that came out in 2008, and without a doubts the best comedy film of the last decade. The cinematography is fantastic, widely superior than your conventional comedy film. The shots from Bruges are just incredible and breath taking. Stunning as well is the music, composed by Carter Buwell. Fine tracks which fits well into the film's atmosphere.The plot is also very peculiar. It has some dramatic and silly moments, and i must say that it don't has a perfect balance between the extremes, and it suddenly may go from suicide sequences to a discussion about a war between black dwarfs and white dwarfs. It's crazy. This probably was the intention of the author, mixing Greek tragedy with the extremely silly and comic situations. It's weird, and it worked. Absolutely worked.And as said previously, In Bruges is a very smart film. The plot has a very deep content and explores in a fine way, subjects as the religiosity and will to live. Will to live in fact, is what moves this film. It's possible to see the irony in the events this film presents, such as the fact that when Farrel's character wants to die, he is completely safe, but when he finally is dying, he starts to will his life. This irony in fact, is what makes this film so great in my opinion. Forget all the idiocy of the characters, the tragedy aspects and the fact that it is a well made film technically. This film is great because of the irony. The irony of the life. Fantastic. And of course, Colin did pretty well his here In Bruges, and deservedly won the golden globe for his effort.

There are so many wonderful moments and hilarious one-liners, but it never feels forced or strained. Instead, the comedy comes naturally from the situations and the characters.I don't think I've ever seen Colin Farrell in a comedic role before, but he delivers a fantastic performance. The same said can be said about the rest of the cast who were all wonderful.In Bruges was one of the best and funniest movies that I've seen this year, and I've seen quite a bunch. It's quite rare with a movie that manages to balance drama and comedy so well.It is definitely a movie that I am likely to watch many times again in the future.

The pair are constantly at odds and like any great comedy duo play off each other amazingly well, the dialogue is fast and funny and the only let up is to make way for action or at times poignancy. The films charm lies in the fact that you can never quite tell what it wants to be, just when you think it's a sharp script based comedy like 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' it changes direction to become a tense thriller via moments that wouldn't seem out of place in a Farley brothers gross out movie. As well as an impressive use of swearing and some totally un-pc insults there are effects that would make even the strongest stomached patron wince a little, but as part of the whole package including a great little part from Fiennes as big boss Harry, this is one of the most enjoyable cinema going experiences I've had all year.

It does not pack any laugh out loud kind of jokes, but the one that leaves a smile on you with it's subtlety and darkness and a nod of appreciation for it's wit. A hit goes bad as a kid gets killed by accident and the two guys Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) responsible for it are asked to go to Bruges, Belgium to get away from the heat. Takes a little while to get used to Colin Farrell's histrionics as it starts and it gets better as it goes. Gleeson does full justice to a terrific role. Bruges, the town itself is a character and justifies the title of the movie. Last and not the least, Clémence Poésy has the best smile going around and she is mostly used as a pretty doll. It packs sharp and dark satirical dialogue that is full of wit and fun and there are many sequences which makes full use of it, be it the ones involving the midget or how they go on in the climax about honor.

Martin McDonagh's whip-sharp hit-man comedy is one of the most rewarding films I've ever invested time in. The film unites Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes - three of the most talented and under-appreciated actors the UK has working today - and produces amazing work from all three. In Bruges does a fantastic job balancing the drama with the comedic, remembering to be sombre but never forgetting to lighten the mood. The jokes are sharp and blunt, delivered flawlessly by the trio of lead men (and also by the lovely Clémence Poésy, an underrated treat in herself). PC police will find plenty to complain about here, but as Brendan Gleeson would tell them....well he says it better.Gleeson and Farell share chemistry and barbed wordplay with the skill that Pulp Fiction wowed us with back in 1994.

144,greene515,There will be blood!(Too much!),2,26 March 2008,"'Martin McDonough's 'In Bruges' with the dream casting of Colin Farrell, and Brendan Gleeson, as bumbling hit-man, and seasoned hit-man who flee to the beautiful city of the title after Farrell botches a hit, the pair take in all the sights the beautiful city has to offer, the rest of the film chronicles Farrells wayward romance with a beautiful drug dealer who supplies film crews with drugs, there is an amusing subplot which Farrell befriends a diminutive actor who is making a 'eurotrash' film on location, the villain of this film is Ralph Fiennes who literary phones in his performance, his role is very like a take off of Sir Ben Kingsley in ' Sexy Beast' Gleeson receives orders to take do away with his protégé, but failing to do so only incurs the wrath of Fiennes,who travels to Bruges for an overtly bloody shootout,The downside to this film is the 'overuse' of strong language which is evidently used in a conversation with Ralph Fiennes and Gleeson it's usage is akin to a swearing contest! how many times do we have to hear the dreaded 'C***' word uttered? in the space of one minute almost twelve! one of the 'funny moments' which at least tries for laughs is Farrell's berating of an obese American family who are offended by his remarks regarding their weight! the scene is amateurish in it's staging and would best suit the cutting room floor, or deleted scene section on the DVD. Unfortunately the 'shoot em up' climax is marred with a downbeat 'shoot em up 'climax which feature some of the most realistic gunshot wounds ever committed to celluloid Sam Peckinpah would be proud! gore-hounds will not be disappointed with the liberal overuse of blood and gore which seem left over from a previous film albeit of an Eli Roth nature( witness Brendan Gleeson fall from the tower a bit over the top, but nevertheless very well done) I was reasonably entertained by this but feel that the filmmakers could of toned down the content instead of going all the way to 'eleven' Gorehounds will be pleased everyone else will probably have a sour taste in their mouths. for a better buddy,buddy pairing there's '48 Hrs' 'Midnight Run'",In Bruges
145,badajoz-1,Boring rip off of geyser Tarantino movie,2,5 December 2010,"In January 1993 I sat in a Cambridge cinema and watched an OK movie - not great but OK. It was called 'Reservoir Dogs' and I am still watching rubbish homages cum lazy rip offs of that so-called ground-breaking movie - 'In Bruges' is the latest and it is pretty poor. Yes, the first fifty minutes are OK in a breezy comic sort of way as a couple of hit men try to come to terms with being exiled after a botched job in Bruges. Then it tries to mix serious with comic and completely collapses so that even an excellent Brendan Glesson cannot save. Once again a director who has had praise for his first film makes a turkey but the critics cannot go back on their first impressions - witness the absolute rubbish that Tarantino has been turning out since his debut!!!!!!!!! So Ralph Fiennes, sporting the worst cockney accent since Dick Van Dyke (it's too posh even for mockney), arrives to kill Colin Farrell, spending hours walking around with a gun firing indiscriminately at the tourists with not a policeman in sight!!!! I kid you not! Unbelievable, don't care about the characters, writing that should not grace a ten year old's Nativity Play, and swearing that merely becomes tiresome. Well done, Film Four, thank you for such terrible cr**!!!",In Bruges
146,tburke85,In Bruges Much Better Than Expected,8,8 June 2009,"In Bruges was a better than expected action crime thriller comedy because of the great performances by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson as two hit men held up in Bruges after a difficult job, and Raplh Fiennes in a brief role as their angry boss. Writer/Director Martin McDonagh does an admirable job of bringing this movie to the big screen with just enough humor, action, and some suspense thats makes In Bruges an enjoyable film. The rest of supporting cast are good in their roles but it's Farrell, Gleeson, and Fiennes who stand out amongst them. In Bruges impressed me it was funny at times and violent with dark humor. Most of the screen time is given to the two leads (Farrell and Gleeson) who definitely make the best of it their scenes together are worth watching the film alone. Ralph Fiennes does lack screen time because he doesn't show up until late into the movie but he does a decent enough job with his smart part. I recommend anyone looking for a movie to watch thats different and entertaining at the same time most of that because of the terrific performances by Farrell and Gleeson. If you're a fan of action crime thrillers with humor or anyone in the cast than In Bruges is the movie for you.",In Bruges
147,dimplet,A pointless movie filled with senseless violence,4,1 August 2011,"After watching The Lady Killers and reading all the reviews here saying it was not funny, and then watching In Bruges and seeing all the reviews calling it funny, humorous, hilarious and entertaining, I have to wonder if the world has truly gone mad. I decided to finally give this movie a try after hearing an interview with Brendan Gleeson on Fresh Air with Terry Gross. I will say this for the film: It is powerful, has beautiful cinematography, all round fine acting and a good score. I can even see elements of black humor, like the encounter in the park -- I'm not obtuse. But unless you enjoy seeing graphic, senseless violence in myriad forms, and find it funny to see it repeated over and over and over, I don't think you can call it funny, humorous or even entertaining, and certainly not hilarious. I would also call it unforgettable, which, sadly, I prefer to do with such violent fare.I've lost count of all the violence, but I do know we get to witness in graphic detail two suicides, one by blowing his head off with a gun in his mouth, the other by jumping off a tower onto the pavement, two children lying in pools of blood from accidental shootings, a contract shooting or two, a blinding, a beating to death, a beating to near death, a shooting victim who inexplicably lives, and probably more that I don't remember. The endless gratuitous violence in In Bruges makes Fargo look like a Currier and Ives Christmas card.What's the point? Killing people is now a joke in the 21st century? Tell that to Norway. There seem to be some unexplained plot elements, like why Ray shot the priest in the confessional. I don't recall him receiving any instructions, or even getting a gun. I also don't see how the little boy got shot accidentally. Maybe I missed something, but I am not going to go back to figure it out. In the real world, the shooting of a priest and a small boy would be in the news. In Bruges, nothing. And Ray goes bragging about it to a woman he's just met. This is not realism, it is adolescent fantasy.There are people who enjoy watching graphic violence. There are American films that cater to those tastes, but I never watch them. Then you see foreigners who think these films are realistic depictions of America. I presume and sincerely hope this is not a realistic depiction of Brits or Europeans; I'm not quite as sure about Russians, from what I read in the news. More to the point, is this movie an indicator of European tastes?Stepping back for a moment, I think what this film indicates is that there are serious social and moral problems in most places: drugs, violence, prostitution, murder. There also seems to be a decline in aesthetics due to hyper-stimulation, demanding more and more intense experiences, so that some people have lost the ability to appreciate subtlety and delicacy of humor, such as in The Lady Killers. I suppose there is a place for films like In Bruges, which is a sort of 21st century take on Fellini surrealism. I would have found it more palatable without the graphic gore and violence. Even though it is fiction and make believe, I find it still tends to deaden the soul. Frankly, I found it a degrading experience to be dragged through this sewer.But not everyone agrees. Oddly enough, Bruges, the city, has worked In Bruges, the movie, into its tourism marketing. I hear tourism is up.So what's next for Martin McDonagh? How about a week in the life of two sadistic serial killers? Or a mass murderer who blows up buildings and shoots up a children's camp? Or a suicide bomber who hijacks a school bus? Those movies should be a barrel of laughs for this crowd.Spoiler alert:The ending is bogus. Harry shoots Ray with a large caliber ""dum-dum"" bullet clear through, and he not only lives, but Ray runs half way across town with Harry in chase. So Harry shoots him again and again and again, yet Ray is carried off on a stretcher, alive and conscious. You must be kidding. Is this one of the jokes others find so hilarious?The whole point of ""dum-dum"" bullets is that they mushroom on impact, shear open, shredding the innards of the victim beyond any hope of medical help and remain there in fragments, instead of passing through the body intact as shown in the film. Death is usually nearly instantaneous -- a ""dum-dum"" bullet is designed to stop a rampaging animal dead in its tracks -- or human -- with a single shot. You would not see a bloody exit wound in the back. Look it up.-- Note to IMDb on spell checker: It's ""d u m d u m"" not dumb dumb.",In Bruges
148,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,The best script of the year. All three leads are marvelous.,10,13 July 2008,"Ah, we finally reach Spy's favorite genre of film: the hit-man dramedy. One of my favorite films is The Matador, which is about a dysfunctional hit-man's friendship with a regular average joe. In Bruges, while sporting similar characters, is different in the plot and outcome, but is the same in that it is now one of my favorite films.It is a great character study. Martin McDonagh's existential hit-man piece has wonderful humor packed into a greater drama that serves as a big time eye opener for our characters. All three of our leads, Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, and Ralph Fiennes, will experience a change in their outlooks on life before the credits roll. For those that do not know this film, it follows the misadventures of two hit men (Farrell and Gleeson) in Bruges, Belgium as they await a call from their boss (Fiennes). It's a moving picture, despite the fact that it moves fast and has some of the best comedic dialog of the year. I found the movie utterly hilarious at some points, with most of the humor coming from Colin Farrell.I've always found that the existential/introspective type of dramedy has been my favorite type of film, and the fact that there's guns firing and laughs bursting at the same time only makes it better. There's humor injected into all the action sequences (though they are few and far between, they are well shot and edited). A good score also helps the film out a lot, but this film truly belongs to our actors.I never thought I'd say this, but DAMN! Colin Farrell is wonderful in the film, and in my opinion, his role was the hardest to pull off. I've noticed that Farrell's best performances come when he uses his natural Irish accent. The emotional intensity of Farrell's performance, combined with his uncanny comic timing, make for the best performance of his career, bar none. His character was my favorite in the story, and he really impressed me here. Brendan Gleeson...well, I've long felt that he's one of Europe's diamonds in the rough, and very underrated. Hopefully he gets the exposure he deserves from this film. Gleeson, giving us a wonderfully introspective show, helps provide the wisdom and balance to Farrell's fast talking youngster. The partners really compliment each other. Then there's Ralph Fiennes, who, despite being absent for a big portion of the movie, had me on the floor laughing when he finally enters (he is heard on the phone at some point but doesn't actually appear for a while longer). To continue the appearances of cast members from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Clemence Poesy is also impressive (and might I say, quite beautiful) and well casted in her role as Chloe.In Bruges is a true gem of an action/dramedy that shouldn't be missed. It has a wonderful script with the best dialog of the year, some of which will have you laughing through the next few lines after. It's a beautiful character study and a well shot piece that will make our director a hot commodity over the next few years. Farrell, Gleeson, and Fiennes should be proud to have this movie on their resumes. I know I would be.",In Bruges
149,tnrcooper,Fear and loathing....and horse tranquilizers...in Bruges,10,2 March 2008,"This is exactly my sort of film. If you like edgy, minimalist crime capers, this is your sort of film too. If you liked ""The Limey"" and/or ""The Matador"", I think you'll like this one. Really I thought I'd like this one, but didn't expect it to be as satisfying as it was.Colin Farrell really should be considered for an Oscar for this performance. He plays Ray, a troubled hit-man who is struggling to come to terms with the aftermath of a hit gone wrong. While some commenters have noted Ray's erratic behavior, few have mentioned his quite profound crisis of conscience. Some might say he has no conscience but that is undercut by the moral code to which the hit men in this film adhere. This one act has thrown him completely off-course and he acts out in anti-social (and very funny) ways. He insults other tourists; he is excessively irritated by minor things. He is completely disinterested in sightseeing in the beautiful medieval city (it's in Belgium) where he and and his laid-back accomplice, Ken (the ever professional Brendan Gleeson) have been sent with instructions to lay low until they get their next word from their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes playing a character whose job and demeanor seem very similar to those of Ben Kingsley in ""Sexy Beast."" That said, Fiennes, makes this role his own with his passion and intelligence).Director Martin McDonagh, as mentioned, has a flare for capturing the ultimately sad human essence of hit men. He does not glamorize them but captures them at their most mundane. The laughs seem all the funnier for their very universality. That said, he never loses sight of the fact that this story is really about hit men attempting to come to terms with what they have done. It lends the story a sobering undertone which ensures the movie will stay with you for a long time. Farrell is absolutely at the top of his game. Fiennes is (like Ben Kingsley in ""Sexy Beast"") scarily psychotic, and Brendan Gleeson is, like others have said in comments, the moral center of the film. The conclusion is satisfying and appropriate and I cannot wait to see what McDonagh does next.",In Bruges

He and his partner, the older, more seasoned Ken (Brendan Gleeson), are packed out of London by their overbearing crime boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes, almost unrecognizable with cockney accent and perpetual sneer) to the quiet Belgian tourist town of Bruges. They are to stay in Bruges until they receive further orders from Harry. They are urged to enjoy their time in the city, which Harry remembers from his childhood as being ""like a f-ing fairy tale or something.""This hilarious, moody, very violent film by writer-director Martin McDonagh is incredibly difficult to characterize. Is it a comedy? An action/heist flick? A downer drama? Hard to say. Whatever it is, it blends elements of all these genres brilliantly, features excellent comic performances by the three leads, and even while you're cracking up, you may find yourself pondering larger questions of death, morality, and purpose-why we are where we are, both physically and spiritually.This is a unique, and uniquely enjoyable film that, with humor, examines the conscience and the part it plays in our lives, our deaths, and, perhaps most poignantly, whatever comes in between. A word of warning: you must have a fairly high toleration for disturbing violence and extremely thick Irish accents.",In Bruges
151,mistoppi,"Not what I expected, but excellent!!",8,7 May 2016,"I've seen one other movie from Martin McDonagh: Seven Psychopaths. That one happens to be in one of my top 5 favourite movies, so I thought I'd see something else from Martin McDonagh, since the guy seems to know what he's doing. He's an excellent writer, and it can be seen in In Bruges as well. McDonagh is phenomenal at writing dialogue. It's natural yet colourful, and while it might not be the most politically correct, it works, and no one is trying to convince that the characters of this movie would be extremely good people. Still the moral code of the characters is interesting. They are hit men, criminals, yet killing an innocent little boy is clearly wrong, and all of them seem to agree on that. The view of some of them might just be harder than others'.The music affects this movie a lot. In the beginning the dialogue sounds more like a comedy, but the music makes the whole thing feel like a weird European drama. The copy I rented just had the genre ""comedy"" listed in the back, nothing else, and the beginning gave me a lot of mixed feelings about that, since the beginning seems rather serious - apart from the dialogue. Other than that, the music mostly amplified the feeling of the movie at every point, the beginning just stands out if you're not prepared.But is this film really a comedy? Well, if it is, it certainly isn't the typical simple joke kind of funny. It's extremely dark funny. I was actually surprised at what kind of stuff I found myself chuckling at. this shows how wide the comedy genre actually is, since it includes typical comedies such as 21 Jump Street, not too funny but cheerful movies like The Grand Budapest Hotel and then really dark comedies like In Bruges and Death to Smoochy.In Bruged wasn't what I expected, considering the quite crappy description behind the DVD cover. Still I enjoyed it, however it was quite slow sometimes. Still, the story is intriguing and so are the characters. Definitely worth seeing!",In Bruges
152,Gresh854,Dark Comedy Is Simply The Best,9,17 September 2018,"Can we all as a whole, come to a consensus that Martin McDonagh is a screenwriting genius. I confess, In Bruges is actually my least favorite of McDonagh's filmography (so far)-my favorite being, not-so-popularly, Seven Psychopaths-but that's not to say that this diabolical thriller didn't showcase his distinct talent beyond words.

153,Tcarts76,Decent Comedy/Drama,7,11 October 2012,"This one wasn't bad. I read a lot of reviews that raved for this movie. I don't think it was that great but it was still a relatively good Comedy/Drama. It's got some good looking women, hit men, a even a midget, or dwarf, or little person depending on what you prefer.Colin Farrel plays Ray a hit-man who travels with a fellow hit-man Ken (Brendan Gleeson) to Bruges, Belgium to complete a job for their boss (Ralph Fiennes) Harry. Ray completes the job but is grief stricken when he inadvertently makes a mistake taking out and innocent bystander. Now, his friend and partner Ken is tasked with a hit on Ray. Choices need to be made and it takes both men through quite a mix of characters on the way to a conclusion.It sounds like a pretty grim, more action based drama, but it's not. The comedy aspects are pretty good ala a good Quentin Tarantino, and like his films is pretty dialog heavy, but worth listening to. There wasn't a lot of action in this one, but it is a pretty smart, funny, and intelligent movie. A 7 is the best I can give this one, but a 7 for me is definitely worth a view.",In Bruges

They are very violent but seem calm and like normal people. Acting is amazing, the are three powerful actors and they performance just lifted movie up. Doubt and friendship between Farrell and Gleeson characters is amazing as they go through tough time in Bruges. Intelligently written screenplay keeps this movie as one of the better in Crime area. Colin is very strong actor as he proved it also here as struggling with killing of a child. After their boss comes at them it's just chaotic and violent as he's pursuing Ray through Bruges. After finally shooting Ray he also shot a boy and in believe that it's dead he takes his life. That is a powerful thing to do. Very twisty plot but it makes movie even better. Ending is moving as Farrell's character is in ambulance and going to hospital but audience has no idea what is going to happen to him as we are left to choose his destiny by ourselves. Brilliant writing and screenplay is done by McDonagh. 3.5/4",In Bruges

It took a while longer but slowly I was drawn into the story and started to care a little bit about the characters. A few more story twists later and I was engaged, and before I knew it the film had finished. There are quite a few problems with In Bruges but despite all of them I actually I did enjoy it. It's humor is often times dark (which a lot of folks don't get/like in general) some of the scenes are contrived, and there's quite a bit of killing for a film that is in large part a comedy.

The story is good but what makes the film better is the acting and occasional use of humor.PROS: I have always liked Black comedies. This film does not contain that much humor as is present in different films of this genre, but it manages to induce laughter sometimes owing to the acting of Colin Farrell. The story moves slowly and you might feel bored in the starting. The ambiance of the film is cold and silent. After the first half, you will feel happy that you started this film. Another good thing is that there are not too many characters so the details of the story are limited. Acting by all is top notch and Colin farrell definitely deserved an award for this.

159,kyrat,I must've seen another film than everyone else - this was really bad!,2,2 September 2008,"It gets 1 star for the lovely travelogue of Bruges, seeing a Heironymous Bosch and maybe another star for not having a happy ending.-The dialogue was atrocious. Worst of all - it was uninteresting and not amusing. I am even more horrified to learn that this was written by a playwright not some 15 year old watching too many Tarantino films & thinking he's being hip/ironic by making fun of midgets, swearing every 3 seconds & having his characters be amoral and unsympathetic.-The characters were not only all uninteresting and unsympathetic they were all boring. Yes, we get it, they're pathetic, Ray's not very bright, they have no other future, they're amoral, most of the people are violent, homophobic, and racist... but they feel a little bad when kids die. There was NO personal growth on any of their parts - a tiny bit of remorse maybe, no sense of an attempt at redemption (Ray is literally CONFUSED about the concept when Ken tries to spell it out for him). -Ken's sacrifice for Ray came out of nowhere and made no sense (he claims Ray has a chance to change-- there is NO indication from Ray that he will redeem himself or change *in the slightest*!). -There were no interesting/novel action bits or shooting. -Nearly every ""twist"" was obvious and foreseeable (what the ""instructions"" would be, what Ken was doing in the park, most of the ending). -I enjoy most of Ralplh Fiennes movies (other than Maid in Manhattan) but his role here was a waste of time. Unstable evil guy. Absolutely nothing new or even really fleshed out.It was painful and an utter waste of my time! It was derivative and pointless. It didn't entertain me, it didn't make me think, it didn't challenge me, it didn't show me anything new (other than scenery of Bruges), it didn't amuse me (I chuckled maybe twice).If you want a good European locale + action film with character development and clever dialogue watch Hot Fuzz instead.

Not only do they never make any mistakes, they speak the language so brilliantly that they can hold their own in witty conversations with native speakers, firing from a sparkling repartee that includes puns on English words that I assume wouldn't work in their own language. How about making a movie for a change in which Belgians, Germans, Italians, etc. speak English the way they really do, i.e. BADLY? Of course, no explanation is ever given why they speak English so well. Usually one of the native-speaker characters just makes a stupid surprised face and says something like ""Wow, your English is really good"", and that's that. On to the next pun."" In Europe they often do speak flawless English often better than the British, this film is simply wonderful on so many levels, great script, brilliant acting.

161,robsta23,A Near Masterpiece,10,24 February 2015,"When I first viewed this film I had remembered the cover of the DVD which my brother owned, and I thought it would be a simple B-grade action film. I am so glad I was wrong because In Bruges is a true gem which delves into the motifs of guilt and hell/purgatory.With the two main characters we have opposite sides of the personality - this has been said by McDonagh himself. There was a side of him which loved to sight-see (Ken) and the side that just wanted to have fun (Ray). From this we get a very cultured hit man as well as a moody young man itching to get the most out of life (drinking, meeting women, exploring).While I love Ray for his internal struggles, he is somewhat of a hard man to like; he is brutally honest, asks people whether they would kill themselves because of certain traits, and he calls people gay or retarded. But something has happened before the start of the story that makes him question his morality in the middle of the film and whether or not he should be punished for it.This film seems somewhat influenced by Tarantino - at least for the dialogue aspect. It is not plot-based; it touches on pop culture references and includes lingo that make the characters seem more realistic or interesting than just characters. However, the problem is that it seems to try too hard at this.However, there are a good amount of funny conversations or situations in which the characters find themselves. Think Tarantino's dialogue meets an even darker humor, like the humor of the Coen brothers.One plausibility factor I cannot stand, however, is that one character simply refuses to die. To avoid spoilers, I will just say he/she lives way longer than they should have, but this needs to happen to help the plot very late in the film.The thing I love so much about this film is the ending monologue given by Ray (Colin Farrell's character), and the ambiguity behind what has happened to the character and whether this story should be considered a dark fantasy or a horrible reality. It is very enjoyable, and the themes are amazing, but this film falls just short of perfect.Added 5/18/15: Who am I kidding, I LOVE this movie and highly recommend it! 10/10",In Bruges

In Bruges turned out to be an interesting production indeed, but it sure did not turn out to be a comedy. A layer of occasional irony only overlays the localized slow paced grunge of troubled minds stuck in the cold grey Bruges and their relationship.The film successfully manages to turn an otherwise slow and uneventful setting into an interesting and, in today's Hollywood infected world, a refreshing play, basing itself largely on the interaction between the few players who star in it, more than on the story or anything else.

Why beautiful, old, scenic Bruges, where nothing much happens, and when it does happen, it happens very slowly? Ah... Well there is a reason, which is crucial to the plot, and I am definitely not going to go into it here.It's hard to know how to describe ""In Bruges"". Maybe it would be best to describe it as an existential comedy? I don't know. All I will say is that, if Samuel Beckett or Harold Pinter had been commissioned to write an action movie/buddy-buddy comedy, they might have come up with something like ""In Bruges"". There are definite echoes of ""Waiting For Godot"" and ""The Dumb Waiter"" in the dialogue, the situations and the characters.Simply put, ""In Bruges"" is just a gloriously funny and so-black-light-bends-into-it comedy. A brilliant confection of poetry, cynicism, innocence and slapstick. Great turns from Brendan Gleeson as the older, philosophical hit man Ken and Ralph Fiennes as barking mad Essex dog Harry, possibly the most unstable British gangster seen on screen since Ben Kingsley in ""Sexy Beast"". Maybe surprisingly, for some, Colin Farrell shows what a fine performance he can produce when cast in right part. His young killer, Ray, is a mixture of willfulness, innocence, childishness and regret. You feel for him. Really you do.""In Bruges"" will not be a box office smash.

Chocolates and child abuse, and they only invented the chocolates to get to the kids.The line above is only one of the several hilarious, yet sometimes offensive to some, one liners in the film. There's this other very offensive joke about a see-saw and a big fat f'ing retarded black woman but I wouldn't dare tread on that.In Bruges is funny, violent, sarcastic, witty, smart, rude, offensive, boisterous but all in all - laugh out loud fun. Colin Farrell's performance as Ray the disgruntled hit-man is so wickedly hilarious you couldn't stop laughing at his witty one liners and all that crass, rude jokes. His buddy is co-assassin Ken, excellently portrayed by Brendan Gleeson whose deep reserve for Colin's Ray takes on a whole new level when he jumps out of a bell tower to save his best mate's life. That's what I call ""brothers-fo-life"" On the other hand, there's the villain boss Harry, whose demeaning stature and ruthless persona perfectly fits the actor who plays him: the demeaning and ruthless Ralph Fiennes.'In Bruges' is one of those films that's so good you probably haven't even seen it yet.",In Bruges
166,johnny-08,'A lot of midgets tend to kill themselves...',9,23 August 2008,"All I knew before watching this movie are the actors that are in it. I like all the actors involved and I thought that this might be a good movie to watch, but I really had no big expectations. But I was surprised at the end. ""In Bruges"" is a really good movie, with great dialogs and great actors and what I cannot forget to mention: brilliant photography that presents us all Bruges. There is no panoramic scene same like others. Just great! Movie is in some things similar to ""The Matador"". There, we've got only Brosnan shining in not so good movie; but here we've got Farrell & co. shining in very good movie. I must admit that I didn't expect such a good performance from Farrell after disappointing ""Alexander"", ""Ask the Dust"" and ""Miami Vice""; at least disappointing to me. So about the script.Movie is about two professional killers Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) who come in Bruges on some sort of vacation. There, they must keep low profile and wait for the further instructions of their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes). As the movie goes on we found out that Ray is troubled by his first job. He accidentally killed a young boy while he was trying to kill his target. Because of that he's got suicidal thoughts. And one more thing, Ray really dislikes Bruges. His older partner, Ken is enjoying in Bruges and its culture, with all that old houses, churches, towers and canals. Ray meets Chloë on set of the movie that took place in central of Bruges. But soon Ken is given instructions to kill Ray, because of his incident with the little boy.""In Bruges"" is first long movie of Martin McDonagh. McDonagh wrote a fine scenario, where he puts one younger and older killer in front and fills the movie with big doses of dark humor (mostly coming from Ray, who acts sarcastic about everything) and nice turn in a story. I must say that the ending is quite unexpected; it's not American happy ending where everybody lives happy after. That's why this movie is so good. With message that you must follow your principals and with lots of irony, humor and strange events (like dwarf war). Also McDonagh presents his characters like ordinary people, with all their problems. But what's most important is that he managed to combine humor and human tragedy (Ray falls in love but he must be punished because he killed a child) in a way that at the end you feel sorry for main characters even though there is no completely positive character (only that little boy). So, ""In Bruges"" is not a movie for everybody. If you expect action comedy, look somewhere else. Cause this movie has a big touch of drama and makes you think about it. Great debut for McDonagh, one of the best roles for Farrell and great movie for me (and I hope for all of you).",In Bruges
167,Spaceygirl,Effing funny!,10,18 November 2008,"""In Bruges' is easily the funniest movie I've seen this year! Brendan Gleeson shines in his role, Colin Farrell is sweetly believable and Ralph Fiennes steals the show. The supporting cast is also outstanding, ably supporting the stars. Bruges is beautiful, a fairy tale town I'd never even had heard of before this movie! The script is a cracker..the dialogue sparkles and the banter between Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell is hilarious! 'In Bruges' is one of those films that demands repeat viewings simply because you're laughing so hard that you might miss the next one-liner. Admittedly, it may be offensive to those of a sensitive dispostition, but if you watch it with an open mind, you'll be surprisingly entertained. My favourite movie of 2008 so far!",In Bruges
168,grandmastersik,"Sometimes, it's not the concept, but the execution",7,18 May 2016,"Pun intended.In the kind of film we've seen so many times before from both Britain and Hong Kong, buddy killers go to another country to lie low after a hit, but that's not the only reason they've been moved out of the picture...What separates In Bruges from all these other flicks is the fact that it has moments that are entirely p**s-your-pants funny! The actors all do a great job, the pacing of the film is superb and the soundtrack captures the tone and setting excellently - I honestly can't recall the last time I commented positively on a soundtrack!However, the ending is both predictable and illogical - given the inconsistencies in damage - which really led me to reducing a stellar 8-star film to a 7. Which is definitely still great.P.S. not everyone will ""get"" the humour of the film, but for those who do, you won't be disappointed.",In Bruges

170,kevin_crighton,"A funny, and touching character drama",9,28 April 2008,"After a hit on a priest goes wrong Ray and Ken, the hit men involved, are sent to Bruges to hide out by their boss. While there, they get involved with a dwarf actor, a female drug dealer, and all the while Ray complains about Bruges....I don't want to reveal a lot of the plot here, but I have to say as a movie it's never what you expect. The script by writer/director Martin McDonagh is very funny in a politically incorrect way. McDonagh also directs well, getting good performances from Brendan Gleeson, Ralph Fiennes and especially Colin Farrell. This is probably his best performance yet. The rest of the cast are all good too, with a special mention to Jordan Prentice, who plays Jimmy the dwarf in the movie. His character takes a bit of a kicking via comments in the script, but he holds his own with the other actors in the movie.As I stated the movie is very funny, but it's not a comedy. Instead, it's more of a character piece, with every character well thought out in the movie, and most get their own little moments. However when Harry (Fiennes) shows up, it sets up the dramatic climax with a burst of action, which again McDonagh handles well. The climax of the movie is a little downbeat, but yet seems right for the movie.The city of Bruges takes takes a bit of beating in the script, but it looks a wonderful city, and gives some scenes a dream-like quality. It looks fantastic and a wonderful place to visit.As is the movie.",In Bruges
171,MichaelMRamey,My Favorite Colin Ferrell Film,9,23 August 2018,"This film can be a hit or miss for people and I can understand why with it being a dark comedy. However for me, I absolutely love it! It's just on the verge of one of my all time top favorited and that's why I gave it a 9. It's hilarious while still sticking to its dark plot; creating moments of great acting and human emotion. This is also a movie you can watch multiple times and still enjoy.",In Bruges
172,Benjamin_Cox,A sure-fire cult classic - different but very good - 85%,8,16 December 2008,"From the off, this had the look and feel of a cult movie. Being neither an out-and-out comedy nor an action thriller, I personally feel that this movie was mis-marketed - however, at least the PR machine made me want to watch it in the first place and I'm glad I did. Feeling like a cross between ""Father Ted"" and ""The Bourne Identity"", this is a beautifully shot film full of humour and pathos in equal measures. It's also the first film I can recall seeing where Colin Farrell isn't a huge disappointment.""In Bruges"" introduces us to two Irish hit men - child-like Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) who are ordered to lay low in Bruges (in Belgium) for two weeks after a job in London while awaiting further instructions from their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes). Ken enjoys his time while Ray can't wait to get out until he meets Chloë (Clémence Poésy), who is working on a film with dwarf actor Jimmy (Jordan Prentice). But after botching a job and finding himself the target, both Ray and Ken struggle to deal with the consequences of their actions...There will be few who would argue that ""In Bruges"" is anything original as it is rather reminiscent of a Guy Ritchie gangster flick as the characters and plot tangle with each other in unexpected ways. The balance of humour and drama also matches Ritchie's output though due to heavy Irish accents, you sometimes struggle to hear all of the fabulously witty dialogue. But ""In Bruges"" does offer some crucial differences, the biggest being Farrell who produces the goods in a way I never expected he could. He and Gleeson exchange some brilliant dialogue as they come to terms with past mistakes and choices. Fiennes is also very good as the urbane killer with a family life and a potty mouth. The other surprise is Bruges itself, looking every inch like the medieval dreamscape it feels like in the movie and provides not only a rich backdrop but also another character interacting with the actors.However, the plot itself is pretty standard gangster fare (albeit, set in Belgium) and there are still questions left at the end of the film. But these don't distract you from what is an extremely good, low-budget movie that offers big dollops of laughs, action and soul-searching amid a picturesque Gothic town in Belgium. No doubt about it, this is a difficult movie to pigeonhole and I know some people who'll watch this expecting something different and going home disappointed. Probably the film closest to this in feel and style is the equally cult ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"" and that didn't do too well at the box office either. But if you're in the mood for something different but still entertaining then this could be exactly what you're looking for. Give it a go but leave your expectations at the door. Then book a flight to Belguim...",In Bruges
173,priyantha-bandara,Silent kill,8,17 January 2011,"My rating 4/5 I sometimes wonder what actually makes a movie boring or interesting. Is it the script, story or the pure performance by the actors? Or is it the overall mood of the movie? How come some fast phased action movies are so boring and some slow phased dramas are truly interesting? I guess there is no single answer. But 'In Bruges' makes me rethink these things.'In Bruges' is about 2 hit men (Ray and Ken) who go in to hiding and waiting for the next big job in Belgium at the tourist city of Bruges. The plot unfolds the emotional difficulties which they have to tackle whilst conquering the differences between themselves in order to be prepared for the upcoming job. And a certain regret which starts to drawback Ray from everything. While Ken calls Bruges a paradise Ray find the city to be boring and uneventful (Shithall in his own words) until he met with some local beauty. (I won't be telling the rest of the story spoiling the thriller part so don't push me) 'In Bruges' in many ways remind me of 'The American'. Of course The American was made recently and In Bruges was earlier so I think the recent movie must have had a mild inspiration there. Especially the story line including professional hit men and the wonderful sets in the small cities of Europe gives me some similarities. 'In Bruges' show some breath taking mid evil architecture quite impressively while giving several background info on them as well.The most entertaining part of the whole movie is the story. Yes there are crime and twists but more than that there are feelings, pain and emotion which drives it strong. When it comes to performance Colin Farrell (Ray) just melts his character right in to the viewer's hearts. Don't think you will ever get the feeling to forgive an assassin like you would want it to be for Ray.Overall the movie is quite slow. For the first 40 minutes there is nothing much at all other than the two guys roaming the city and talking about their differences. But that nicely creates a base for the next half of the movie which has more drama and action. Sometimes there is sudden unexpected gore which you may not get used to it until the last scene.Overall 'In Bruges' is a gem in between the monotonous vastly scattered pebbles.Read more review of mine at www.flickshout.blogspot.com",In Bruges
174,joestank15,How will this affect tourism In Bruges? People might actually know of its existence!,9,14 March 2008,"In Bruges - Two hit-man named Ken and Ray (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Ferrell respectively) are ordered by boss Harry (the always excellent Ralph Fiennes) to go to Bruges, a quaint little nothing town in Belgium. Ken enjoys the sights, but Ray doesn't. Soon Ken gets orders to kill Ray for botching a job.This is a gem of a movie. Both hilarious and suspenseful, it has the comedy that can only come from European sensibilities (good writing and careful story arcing, that sort of thing). The directing and editing are also of notice. The film also has the good sense to keep things down to earth, which actually makes it all the funnier. Colin Ferrell is twitchy, irritable, and has no control over his tongue, while Brendan Gleeson's character is a sober, dignified calm soul. Ralph Fiennes plays a foul-mouthed, straight-forward assassin with a code of honor. He needs to do more films like this. He more or less steals every scene he's in without even trying.On a sidenote, I wonder how this will affect tourism in Bruges, despite Ray's constant put-downs of the city (and one horrid joke about Belgium, but never mind that). Probably in the positive, for all press is good press. The city, for it's medieval quaintness, practically is a character in the film. The movie will probably raise people's awareness of the city in any case. It's an impeccably plotted story-arc with dramatic moments almost as powerful as the laugh out loud moments (and Lord, were there many).Hilarious and overall enjoyable, In Bruges gets an A-",In Bruges
175,Jamie_Seaton,What's all the fuss about,4,15 December 2009,now i'm really into classy cinema and i usual like what all the critics like but i really don't understand why this has been hyped up so much..... its a fairly straight forward plot about two guys that are hit-man and are basically chilling out in Belgium. i guess the film talks on some levels about friendship and atonement but it doesn't save the boring plot. Colin Farrel does an OK job i guess and Ralph Fiennes is my favourite in this even though he's hardly in it. i wouldn't class this film as a comedy even though there are some subtle comedy underlinings. i'd be more accurate by saying this film is a moody and dramatic piece. i really couldn't find anything special about this. i didn't hate it. it had its moments of originality and i guess some people will love this but the film really didn't grab me.i am extremely astonished that this is in the top 250. its makes me think there must be something subliminal going on in this film that i didn't catch on too. overall this film was a let down and really left me feeling like i wasted my money from purchasing it........... 4.5/10...........j.d Seaton,In Bruges
176,Barky44,Very Good Second Work for McDonagh,8,24 February 2008,"""In Bruges"" is writer/director Martin McDonagh's second film (the first being 2004's ""Six Shooter""). I never saw the latter, but I saw the former last night, and it is a very good, very entertaining movie. McDonagh still has something to learn about writing, but he's nearly there, and I think I should have to keep an eye on IMDb for further works by this guy.""In Bruges"" is a great collection of well-crafted sequences. First is the opening exposition on Bruges itself, a doddering old medieval town which Irish felon Ray (well played by Colin Farrell) despises outright. His entire commentary on frumpy tourist towns early in the film is hysterical and quite accurate (I've been to a lot of frumpy tourist towns and thought most of what Ray says more than once).The film continues on with other hysterical scenes, like Ray's encounter with obese Americans (this film is quite hard on America, actually, but I didn't mind one bit). There's also a botched robbery, where typical tourist-town criminals try to roll Ray for cash, and get far more than they bargained for.The film then moves on to introspective moments. Here is where Farrell's co-star, Brendan Gleeson, comes to the fore. He plays a quiet career criminal with a conscience, concerned for the future of Ray's very soul. I can't go into detail without announcing spoilers, but these scenes are good, too.Then there's a great closing sequence where the astoundingly profane crime boss, fantastically played by Ralph Fiennes, catches up to the two hit men for a big showdown in the doddery village.There are so many great moments and characters in this film, I couldn't really type them all up. But here's a quick list: a one-eyed thief; a racist dwarf; a goofy European movie set; a tourist trap ticket-taker who takes his job waaay too seriously; a beautiful local drug dealer; horse tranquilizers; a vulgar phone message; and a pair of smoke-phobic Canadians.My one and only problem with this film is the overall writing. As I said, there are a lot of great sequences in this film, and a lot of great dialogue. However, there's something not quite right with the structure of the piece. It has been said that the two toughest parts about writing a story are the beginning and the end. McDonagh seems to have trouble with beginnings, this film is quite fragmented up front and takes a while to build up steam. I found this quite distracting. He also doesn't really segue well. Sometimes you're wondering ""why did we move to this scene?"", although once you do get there, you love what you're seeing.I think McDonagh is well on his way, though, for these flaws are something that can be overcome given adequate effort and experience. Overall, I liked ""In Bruges"", and recommend it for those who like goofy criminal capers with a heart.",In Bruges

178,nturner,Tongue-In-Cheek Treat,8,7 November 2008,"Bruges is a city in Belgium that has most of its medieval architecture intact, and it serves as a character in this film much as New York City, London, of Los Angeles often serve as characters in many films. In Bruges is a dark and very bloody comedy in which the city of Bruges adds its own somewhat bizarre background. Bruges is not of our everyday world just as the events in the film are surely not daily experiences.Ray is a novice hit man who on his very first job, accidentally kills a young boy. Ray is sent to Bruges with an older hit man, Ken by their boss, Harry. The reason given to Ray by Harry is so he can basically get his head together after his horrifying mistake. The real reason is that Ray has been sent to Bruges to be murdered by Ken. At the beginning, Ken only suspects this assignment until he is contacted by Harry.The older, wiser, more sophisticated Ken is overwhelmed by the history, art, and beauty of Bruges whereas the young and crude Ray hates being stuck in this little city so far removed from modern times. As their visit continues, Ken endeavors to interest Ray in the sights and knowledge available, but Ray, who is wracked with guild over murdering a young boy, only wants to drown his remorse with drink, drugs and the companionship of a newfound local girl.Eventually, Ken receives the phone call he has been dreading in the back of his mind. Harry orders that Ray be murdered because, ""You can't kill a kid and live."" All of this leads to an extremely bloody ending, but along the way, the audience is treated to a string of bizarre characters and even more bizarre events that are filled with delightful dark, dark element of comedy.Along with the tight darkly humorous script, the superior acting - especially the acting of the three male leads - is what gives In Bruges its eight stars.Brendan Gleeson plays Ken and his beautifully understated depiction of a man worn down by his own sins who just wants to survive is a sight to see. It would seem impossible to feel any sympathy for a man who murders for his profession, but Gleeson gives us such a man.Colin Farrell at thirty-two is ten years too young for the part of Ray, but his considerable acting talent enables you to forgive those extra years. He makes you believe he is Ray, a young man from the wrong side of the tracks who has accidentally committed an unpardonable sin and is suffering in his soul.Ralph Fiennes may be a little over the top as Harry, the boss, but he certainly pulls it off. Keep in mind that these are unreal people in an unreal environment, so a little overacting can certainly be forgiven.These three stars of the film are supported by a group of premier actors in series of extremely unusual roles.As for the DVD, the extra features are a real treat. Not only is there a very good ""making of"" video, there is a beautiful tour of Bruges. The delight of the extras, however, is a short video based upon the considerable foul language in the film which would make a sailor blush. This f**king little video is fun, fun.Yes, In Bruges is dark and bloody. If you shy away from such fare, avoid this film, but if you can plant your tongue firmly in your cheek and sit back to enjoy a flight of sinister fancy, give this film a viewing.",In Bruges
179,Simon_Says_Movies,"A distinct setting, career high performances and faultless direction make In Bruges a beguiling fable",10,14 November 2008,"If The Dark Knight is the film with the biggest most grandiose hype surrounding it this year, then In Bruges would be the biggest sneaky surprise. Not only is the writing as snappy and perfectly honed as any other film, big or small, this year but boasts career high performances from the entirety of its cast. Dark comedies are hard to master, and this is certainly the most worthwhile I have seen since Lethal Weapon creator Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang; especially with far lesser attempts such as War Inc. fouling up the pond.Bruges, the capital of West Flanders in Belgium (pronounced 'Broo-jiz') serves as the quirky setting for second time director Martin McDonagh, and the cinematography and art direction immerses the viewer into this abstract setting. In Bruges evokes a somewhat dreamlike carriage which is efficiently echoed by journey of the characters. This beguiling fable follows two hit men, the distraught and emotionally fragile Ray (Colin Farrell) and the gentle fatherly Ken (Brendan Gleeson) sent by their irritable and emotionally erratic employer Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to Bruges to fulfill a hit. Complicating the situation is Ray's unstable mental state, which was shaken on an earlier job when a young boy was caught in the crossfire, and which has left quite suicidal. The surreal surroundings of Bruges leave Ray wanting, but thrills Ken with its Gothic storybook refinement. Things become even more phantasmal during the meeting of a movie star dwarf, played by Jordan Prentice and with the development of an unlikely relationship between Ray and a local girl, Chloe (Clémence Poséy). These circumstances sway the line between a dreamworld and the bleak reality of the duos proffesions, but never to the extent where the film could be considered a physiological bind-bender by any means.Colin Farrell has always been a solid actor, but needs to rethink his agent, as his roles carry from routine action flicks which leave him emotionally grounded, to art house flops that become far to precious and quirky for their own good. Farrell gives the performance of his career, flawlessly blurring the line between a coy smart-aleck and tragic silhouette. Gleeson is equally sensational, again showing, like never before, his acting chops. I cannot say that Ralph Fiennes gives his best here, as that distinction belongs with his astounding portrayal of Amon Goeth in Schindler's List but it is certainly his most accomplished since then. Poséy is delightful and complex for her small role, and Prentice proves that an actor of his stature does not have to be typecast in meaningless roles.As amazing as the ensemble cast is, kudos are justly due to McDonough, whose writing chops provide the drole and solid foundation for the performances. This effort is simultaneously hilarious, tragic and mystical; and the three blend seamlessly. Unlike other films cut from the same cloth, In Bruges never lets its quirkiness take the story, setting and characters hostage. It is involving and endearing, with countless meaningful undercurrents, and as a whole this film demands repeat viewings; an order I am highly pleased to fill. There is also some gunplay and bloodshed for those who find themselves hard-pressed to sit through a film completely devoid of a scuffle or two. Really, In Bruges takes a bit of everything, and perhaps that is best suited to the continually surreal surroundings that we find the two immersed in, and although risking a lot with such a direction, it never seems scattershot or incoherent. And after this infinitely satisfying adventure, in Bruges was the only place I wanted to be.View all my reviews at Simon Says Movie Reviews: www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",In Bruges
180,billion_mucks,A Breath of Fresh Air: Review from Sundance,9,23 January 2008,"For those who might not know the name, director Martin McDonagh is an Irish playwright who won the Oscar last year for his short film ""Six Shooter"" about a chance encounter on a train, and that film's star Brendan Gleeson has returned as Ken, one of two hit men sent to the medieval city of Bruges in Belgium along with his partner Ray (Colin Farrell) to rest and lay low after a hit gone horribly wrong. Ray is a miserable bastard who makes it clear he's not happy about being in Bruges, but Ken convinces him that their boss Harry has a job for them there, as well as allowing them a chance for some sightseeing, none of which improves Ray's mood. Things look up when he meets the beautiful local woman Chloe, played by French actress Clémence Poésy--you may remember her as Fleur Delacore in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire--and scores himself a date, which also goes horribly wrong due to Ray shooting off his big mouth. From there things continue to go south as Ray and Ken get into all sorts of messes and meet strange characters, all of whom will play a part in the larger picture.There aren't too many non-Belgian films set in Belgium, and Bruges is a beautiful but odd place to set an entire movie. You'll probably learn more about the place than you ever need to know as Ken narrates their sightseeing excursions with a few factoids about the place. The entire first act is driven by the chemistry between Farrell and Gleason as they deliver rapid-fire patter that reminds one of McDonagh's background as a playwright, but it makes them as immediately endearing as Vincent and Jules in ""Pulp Fiction,"" allowing for an even bigger impact as things happen to them. Our first encounter with the boys' boss Harry is an expletive filled telegraph and an equally amusing phone conversation with Ken, making it obvious that this is a mobster cut from the same cloth as Ben Kingsley's Don Logan. Those who don't recognize the voice will be thrilled when they learn who plays Harry, because it's a pleasant surprise.This is easily Colin Farrell's best role and performance in a long time, one that allows him to show a lot of range, not just as the big-mouthed prat we assume Ray to be, but also as a thoughtful man distraught about what happened in London. Having seen the error of his ways, he feels the need to make right, even if he hides it with a lot of complaining and arguments, and that carries over to Gleason's Ken, continuing his great run with McDonagh.McDonagh has created a clever script that interweaves its small cast of characters into an intricate crime caper that mixes humor, violence and true heartfelt human emotions into a brilliant debut feature. Just when you think you know where things are going, McDonagh throws a sharp curve ball at you and then another, and another, and pretty soon, what started as a two-handed talkie has turned into a hold-your-breath action flick, when Harry turns up in Bruges to rectify some business that Ken has botched. Even so, it never loses what made the first half so charming and entertaining, because McDonagh's impressive dialogue remains at the forefront for the extended confrontation between Ken and Harry. The ending might be somewhat grim for some tastes going by the lightness of what's gone before, but the way everything is tied together makes it all worth it.Anyone worried that Tarantino and Ritchie's best work might be behind them, can revel in the promise of McDonagh's take on the crime-comedy genre, as this talented filmmaker shows that ""Six Shooter"" was no fluke and this movie begins what's likely to be a long and promising film career. On top of that, if ""In Bruges"" doesn't end up being the funniest and most quotable movies of the year, then it should be very close",In Bruges
181,dtb,Great Performances and Dialogue Make IN BRUGES a Modern Classic,10,20 April 2011,"I first saw the dark comedy-thriller IN BRUGES (IB) in our local multiplex back in April 2008, and I loved it immediately. No wonder writer/director Martin McDonagh's screenplay went on to be nominated for an Oscar, and co-star Colin Farrell won a Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Comedy/Musical! When McDonagh's short film SIX SHOOTER, starring Brendan Gleeson, won the 2005 Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film, I was already familiar with his plays (including the 2005 Broadway hit THE PILLOWMAN with our family's household fave Jeff Goldblum), so I looked forward to seeing Gleeson work with McDonagh again in IB. I wasn't disappointed. McDonagh's quirky, funny, soul-searching dialogue is a joy to hear. It's chock full of profanity, but the delivery renders it more comical than offensive. The filmmakers even spoof the ""adult language"" in one of the DVD's bonus features, a montage of every time the word ""F***"" is used in IB.Gleeson and Farrell make a great seriocomic team as Ken and Ray, two Irish hit men who have suspenseful and surreal adventures hiding out in Belgium in the magnificent city of Bruges after their latest job goes horribly, heartbreakingly wrong. They're the ultimate odd-couple tourists as they await further instructions from their boss, with Ken enjoying the sightseeing and the swans as Ray spews forth befuddled, unfavorable, hilariously un-PC opinions of just about everything and everyone he encounters, except a pretty Flemish production assistant (Clemence Poesy of 127 HOURS), who's as full of surprises as our undercover assassins. Farrell gives one of his very best performances, blending laugh-out-loud comedy and guilt-ridden heartache beautifully. My favorite running gag was Ray's childlike fascination with dwarfs, and his oafish but well-meant concern for cokehead dwarf actor Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), who's in the fairytale-like city to appear in a dream sequence in a local indie art-house flick. As Harry, the boys' crime boss, Ralph Fiennes does a terrific job channeling Sir Ben Kingsley as the terrifying Don in SEXY BEAST (I assure you, that's a compliment!). IB mixes suspense, melancholia, and hilarity very well indeed. Along with THE BANK JOB, IB was my favorite crime film of 2008. The DVD's featurettes and deleted scenes are fun, too, including interviews, a captioned boat tour of Bruges, and a deleted scene involving Matt Smith in his pre-DOCTOR WHO days -- and a machete! The many deleted scenes are all quite entertaining; I'm sure they were only cut so IB wouldn't be a 3-hour epic! :-)",In Bruges
182,The_Dead_See,"Very slow first act, but soon warms up into a fantastic, thoughtful movie",8,12 July 2008,"In Bruges has flaws in abundance, particularly through the first 30 minutes where you are served a couple unlikeable characters, a very slow plot build, and bad dialogue with an extremely distracting overuse of the F word. For a while, you might be forgiven for wondering if you are watching something written by a fourteen year old boy trying (unsuccessfully) to emulate Tarantino or Guy Richie. I caught myself wondering if I should turn it off and do something better with my time instead. My wife commented on how bored she was.Fortunately for us, we bore through that terrible first half-hour and were subsequently rewarded with a movie that became increasingly enjoyable, fresh and... dare I say it... poignant, as it moved along. This is, for the most part, down to an amazing performance by Brendan Gleeson. Collin Farrel is good here, and Ralph Fiennes is great as usual; but it's Gleeson who steals every scene. And it's the honour and integrity of his character Ken that will linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled.",In Bruges
183,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Very nearly top marks,9,10 November 2013,"I absolutely adored 'In Bruges', that's pretty much it. I enjoyed it so much I'm finding it hard to write this review and give the film justice instead of just spewing out compliments.It was wonderfully crude, poignant and violent with lots of swearing and smutty jokes. The acting was excellent throughout, as well as the chemistry between Colin Farrell and Brendon Gleeson. The humour was wonderful and made me laugh out loud several times with pure glee, such as being blanked by an American dwarf and calling him a little c*nt.It was such a breath of fresh air and I would gladly give this film a 10, but reserve that score for those truly wonderful movies that stand the test of time. I pinched myself when I watched it for the first time, just wishing I could watch it afresh all over again, but sadly knowing the experience could never repeat. On second viewing I appreciated the film just as much, but a very small spark was missing, meaning that it isn't quite 10/10 material because, although wonderful, isn't quite brilliant and won't get better over the years.I was really entertained by this treat of a film that I enjoyed SO much.",In Bruges
184,btm1,"Think ""Pulp Fiction"" but darker",9,14 December 2008,"We visited Bruge once. Its memorable and exhausting spiral staircase medieval bell tower is featured in this comic tragedy. There is even a glimpse of the rope that substitutes for a banister. Some of the action also takes place on its canals.""In Bruge""has something of a film-noir feel, but with humor added. The 2008 film's story about Irish hit men (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrel) brought to mind Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) in 1994's ""Pulp Fiction."" But I thought ""Bruge"" a darker movie. It seems more tragic, and the humor more subtle, than ""Pulp Fiction."" Still, the more I think of it, the more I can see similarities. For example, in both films lesser criminals make the mistake of crossing paths with them. ""In Bruge"" has encounters with incidental ""color"" characters who show up again later in ways more significant to the plot.From other reviews I now guess the hit men are supposed to be part of a criminal gang; however, my initial impression from their skill, discipline and ethics (accidentally killing innocents is a violation of their code) was that they were an IRA cell.I thought the movie dragged a bit in the beginning, but then picked up steam.",In Bruges

It just didn't go for me.Hell, I walked out of the theater with 20 minutes left in Saving Private Ryan. I know it's a phenomenal film. I have nothing bad to say about it.

186,blackburnj-1,"Fresh, funny and thoughtful - a great time at the movies",9,28 April 2008,"Black comedy is a difficult thing to do. Very often a balance between hilarity and depth cannot be struck to the point that the amount of comedy is negligible. ""In Bruges"", a story of murder, guilt, suicide and violent gun hands, faces this problem more than most. It is, therefore, a delight that this film is one of the funniest for years as well as being wonderfully dark, twisted and deep.The first thing to say is that this won't be for everyone. It is uncompromisingly violent, it, quite literally, doesn't pull any punches and it is filled to the brim with foul language. But, if you're not put off by any of this sort of thing, then this is highly recommended.It is vaguely reminiscent of ""Withnail and I"". It has three main characters who are all leading a fairly insane existence and who all find themselves in a place that they are alien to. It is also one of the most fantastically sweary films since ""Withnail"" but this is no rip-off. This is one of the most fearlessly fresh films for some years and this is largely thanks to Martin McDonagh.The script is magnificent. It may not provide much pay-off for its philosophising and it does at the end descend into a bloody shootout that is slightly over-cooked, but it is interesting in what it explores and extremely entertaining. It is the bizarre and brilliant humour that is the cornerstone of McDonagh's work. This is a comedy that pulls together witty, surrealist, observational, gross out and subtle, as well as distinctly unsubtle, visual comic techniques, with a heavy dose of character based gags to boot. The result is an onslaught of humour that is irresistible. McDonagh also brings an attractive and striking look to the film with an impressive visual style that promises much for his future work not just as a writer but also as a director.He is also blessed with a fine cast. Brendan Gleeson's quiet, restrained and likable performance is the standout, but a wonderful surprise is that the oft-ridiculed Colin Farrell almost steals the show with a brilliantly subtle and vulnerable turn. The pair work superbly whenever they're on screen together and they are handed a great deal of support. Poésy, as the love interest, is very good, as is Jordan Prentice playing the sardonic but flawed ""dwarf"" (to use the film's terminology). Ralph Fiennes obviously enjoys himself hugely here, given free-reign in a part that demands over-acting of the very highest calibre to display the insanity and menace of the character.The film ends in a marvellous moment of ambiguity having touched on many themes. Prejudice, life and death, guilt, forgiveness, justice, deontological ethics and the sanctity of life, are all there and McDonagh leaves it up to the audience to think about them. It all adds up to a great time at the cinema. Funny, thoughtful, entertaining, this blackest of black comedies is the genre nearing its very best.",In Bruges
187,williambendavis-933-218958,An excellent crime thriller mixed in with some dark humor,8,5 July 2015,"In Bruges is a terrific example of how to properly make a crime thriller mixed with dark humor. It's a very fine line to walk and it's very difficult not to cross that line, so when this type of film is pulled off successfully, it deserves some major credit. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson have awesome chemistry together. Brendan Gleeson always tries to look at things positively and he is met with Colin Farrell's amazingly negative (and funny) responses. The beginning of the film is a tad slow, but once it picks up it grabs you and never lets you go. I was surprised by how much I actually ended up liking it. Overall I though this film was great and I say go see it.",In Bruges

Collin Farrell was great.His acting is great.He did an excellent portrait of depressive,i don't give a damn criminal.Brendan Gleeson is even better an Ralph Fiennes acted this role so strange that you cant recognize him.Good but strange. Anyway i wont write anything else,all i can say that you should watch this movie.If not for the cast than for the movie it self because it's great.Good directing,acting and screenplay are making this movie as good as it is.And it has one of the best endings ever.

189,Barev2013,Spellbinding Breathtaker in Beautiful Belgian city,10,15 December 2014,"The ""Titanic"" international film festival, Budapest's new ""tough guy on the block"" and the only real rival to the annual Hungarian Film Week (Magyar Filmszmele) for the attention of the large film buff community here, closed shop on April 13, 2009, with the screening of a spellbinding new Irish thriller ""In Bruges"", and a closing gala party that lasted far into the night.The closing film ""In Bruges"" was another eye-opener. Directed by Martin McDonagh and set almost entirely in the beautiful Belgian canal city of Bruges, this is one where it's hard to tell whether it's a violent comedy, or a spoof on violence, or a comical violence film about two hard-boiled Irish hit men on the lam in Belgium. Our hero, handsome Irish charmer Colin Farrell, sporting a heavy growth of five-o'clock shadow throughout and constantly lamenting the fact that he accidentally killed a little boy, is not above punching out a lady in a restaurant or karate chopping a poor midget who gets on his nerves -other than that he's quite lovable. Ralph Fiennes (the onetime ""English Patient""), comes in for possibly the most brutal role he's ever played as the obsessed vengeful father of the departed lad, and Irish actor Brendan Gleeson (a veteran of the Harry Potter films) is also quite charming as the avuncular partner in crime of young Farrell. Guns galore and drugs like cocaine and LSD are taken for granted in this colorful criminal saga, and the city of Bruge itself is shown in its full glory, day and night. The music, incidentally, is extremely subtle with a quiet piano playing soothingly in the background of some of the most violent scenes. Very good music in its own right, and compliments to composer Carter Burwell, who does the music for all Coen Brothers flicks among others. Winding up with a breathtaking chase through the cobblestone streets of Bruges at night and a shootout on the canal, ""In Bruges"" literally leaves you gasping for breath and needing a drink... and realizing that, whatever it was about, you just had one helluva romp and laughed a lot. The perfect bookend for a modest film festival in a major east-European capital.",In Bruges
190,IamROCKAS,"What happens In Bruges, stays in your mind like a fond memory of a good experience",8,20 April 2021,"I kind of want to visit Bruges now. It does look like a lovely town and not as small as I imagined as it has over 100 thousand residents. The action that took in Bruges was interesting, surprising to some extent, and most of all - entertaining. I had some high expectations and they were mostly met. To quote Harry, ""You've got to stick to your principles"" and so here I am, writing another review for the movie of the week, chosen by the community of r/Letterboxd.I'd like to start with giving big praise to the score. Whether it's a soft piano tune that brings up the beauty of the medieval scene or an intense sequence that involves a lot of woodwinds and electric guitars during a shootout and the chase, Carter Burwell did a masterful job coordinating it all. I took notice of it ever since the prologue and I imagine that this might be one of the underlying reasons why a lot of people have such fond experiences when watching the movie. The score here is like a good spice that makes your taste receptors tingle even more while simultaneously sticking in the back of your tongue, giving you that lingering feeling even after you've done eating.Speaking of the comedy, or, to be more specific, tragicomedy and dark comedy, in this movie, I'd say it's alright. It wasn't the kind of comedy I tend to enjoy at some points though most of the jokes did land with me or at least made me chuckle a bit. Though, there were a plethora of those that made me roll my eyes too. Overall, combining that with the British banter and an exceptional performance the actors provided, I'd rate it towards the more positive spectrum in the ratings. I don't know why but before watching the movie, I expected this to be dark in the way Heathers (1988) was, just replacing teens with spies and Americans with the brits. In some ways, it's exactly what this movie was but some determinants lead Heathers to be a more enjoyable movie for me. My hypothesis so far is that crime and comedy just don't mix well for my taste in a similar way horror and comedy don't mesh (also for my taste).Lastly, the plot. It's good. Very good, I might add. And what made me really good is simple bits of foreshadowing. And there was a lot of that. Some small things that you wouldn't even expect to be significant ended up foreshadowing the key plot points of the movie. Even as early on as visiting the tower in the main square, where Ken makes a finger-gun motion towards Ray. These simple hints, that don't even look like hints at first, make the late stages of the movie really exciting, despite the ending being tragic in a twisted way. The moment when we see what Harry did to ""the little boy"", I knew exactly what was going to happen and that quote that I provided during the beginning of this review - I can still hear it in his voice as it resonates there from time to time.There was a lot more happening here that I either liked, sometimes felt conflicted about and, on rare occasions, despised and I would like to spread out a discuss a lot of topics but I felt that those three key elements say the most about this movie. Even if I didn't enjoy some elements here, I really enjoyed the music, the plot, and, to some extent, the comedy but that was mostly due to the wit of the actors and the way they delivered it. I kind of feel like the teacher who never gives the highest marks and says ""There's nothing as perfection and nobody will get perfect marks here"". Though this movie is perfect in a way. I wouldn't call this my favorite movie of all time, not even close to that, but it did leave an impression on me and when there's something to remember, something that lingers even a day after watching a movie, I'd say that movie perfectly succeeded in being a quality media of entertainment.",In Bruges

193,imdb-19548,Superb.,10,1 April 2008,"It's rare to find a film that can go from hilarious comedy to dark violence and genuine emotion without compromising either the humour or the drama but this one does it time and again.The cast are excellent, Gleeson is good as the sensible adult figure while Farrell is brilliant as the comic and immature lead. Farrell shows excellent comic timing and gets most of the best lines. The supporting cast are all good, everyone is believable.The humour is often very politically incorrect but never in a nasty way, the dialogue is superb and there are some great set pieces and unexpected comic twists to catch you by surprise and make you laugh out loud.The dramatic side handles a very dark and emotional subject very deftly with believable switches from humour to sadness and the leads really earn there money by pulling those switches off seamlessly.There is a lot of action and violence especially towards the end and this throws in ideas that I had never seen used before.If you liked the film ""Intermission"" you'll definitely like this, but this has more and better jokes and the plot is far more interesting.I've rarely left a cinema feeling I got as much value for my money as I did with this film.",In Bruges
194,MrVibrating,"Morality, violence, character acting, what more can you ask for?",9,5 July 2008,"In Bruges was one of those movies you could see becoming great from a distance. The trailer definitely showed promise and the cast and concept seemed good. A while went and I forgot about it, but then it suddenly movie popped up again, so of course I went to see it.Not really sure what to expect other than Colin Farell, and old guy and Ralph Fiennes interacting in the bizarre location of Bruges, Belgium, the movie was a delightful surprise. There is a good dose of humour, dark and somewhat lighter, and there's more humanity than in all of Hollywood's summer blockbusters combined.Superficially a slow actioner, In Bruges is a morality play, which shows the new-comer director's background in the theater. The interaction between the characters, the amazing twists and turns of the story and the great acting between the three lead men(Brendan Gleeson a surprise to me, his Harry Potter role did not impress but how could it have?) is the main thing to expect from this movie, with a clever and exciting climactic ending to top it off.If you liked Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, or Layer Cake, or any other subtle off-beat dark comedy, then this is definitely for you. Beware of blood and violence at some parts, and heavy themes at others. This is not a movie to take lightly, but give it a chance, it's worth it.",In Bruges

Great conversations, great music, great atmosphere. 3 of the most important things for me when it comes to movies.The only thing that stroke me as a bit odd, was the character Colin has been playing. A naive, childish, conscience-smitten killer with a short temper and a disposition to violence. Even though he was childish and naive, he still was skilled at flirting, and decently witty. An impossible to play character. Collin Farrel made the best out of it.My other problem has been the story. The story isn't too bad, but I found, it had too many coincidences. But, if you don't really pay attention, and if you don't have to analyze everything to death (as I tend to do), you will probably not notice how empty the story is, simply because it is told quite well. If you are a fan of cool gangster movies, like Tarentino movies, this might be for you. It's a great movie, but it's not as witty as a Tarentino movie. And sometimes the conversations seem a bit too odd.",In Bruges
197,CinefanR,"""In Bruges"" aims high and misses by a mile",1,25 May 2012,"""In Bruges"" is an ambitious, but ultimately failed attempt to deliver some sort of existential fable... The internal ""moral"" conflicts of professional assassins weren't amusing in any way or intelligently presented. This subject matter would have any movie director walking on very thin ice. In order to pull it off, the director must display tact, the writer must provide smart dialogue and strong character development; and the actors should skate gracefully. None of those qualities are to be found here.The sickening violence, relentless verbal assault and cringe-inducing jokes (insults) are not only in very poor taste, but a pathetic display of mediocrity. Add some offensive ""moral"" considerations (a dwarf's life is apparently less valuable than a child's life, among others) to the variety of cheap tricks to stir some ""controversy"", and you've got a perfect exploitation flick. I realize the subject matter isn't exactly fairy-tale, but that aggressive vulgarity distracted from everything else. In what bizarro world does that make for ""brilliant writing""? ""In Bruges"" is just one really bad (in a painful, unfunny way) film that desperately wants to be 'artsy'. It's supposed to be a darkly humorous and insightful take on the human condition, but instead it only disgusts. There's no wit, no finesse, no spark in this movie. Ralph Fiennes and Colin Farrell, two fine actors, are surprisingly ineffective here as a result of an atrocious script.

198,TheGOLDENWALRUS,%$#@ing Bruges!,9,3 July 2008,"If there is a person that hates Bruges the most, it would be Ray in the movie In Bruges played brilliantly by Colin Farrell. I can't say I'm a huge fan of Farrell but I couldn't think of anyone else I'd rather see play Ray in this movie.If you like dark humor than this movie is way up your ally. As you might of read in IMDb's trivia section, the word %$#@ is said 125 times in this movie and every time it makes me crack up. Interestingly, Ralph Feinnes doesn't make his mark until the last half hour of the movie. Every scene he is in made me laugh so hard. So many brilliantly played out awkward moments that always have a punch line even if it was meant to be serious. The script was brilliant and very original. The movie only made around 7,000,000 in The United States but then again, most of the little films these days seem to be the better movie.Ray and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are trying to settle down from there wild lives of being hit-man. But it isn't easy for hit-man to blend in as tourist. The big turn of the movie comes around forty minutes but it acts like a small twist so I won't say anything else.They're really isn't much out there on DVD right now so as long as violence, profanity, and drugs (and there are lots of all the above) don't offend you, give In Bruges a try. Could be the biggest surprise of the year.",In Bruges
199,andrewmerritt-31652,My favorite dark comedy film,9,25 November 2019,"In Bruges stars Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, and Ralph Finnes and is directed by Martin McDonagh. The story revolves around two hit men who hide out in a little town in Belgium called Bruges. And one of them loves the town, while the other one hates and despises it. This movie connects with me as will everyone else. I can't tell you how many times I've been across the world and have been bored out of mind because this is the oldest church or the history of this piece of art. Some places around the world have interested me as well as the history, but after a while it becomes excruciating and boring. And that's what this movie does so well. In Bruges captures these two characters that we can relate to these two people. We've all been that one person who is fascinated by history and the other one who finds this place dull and mundane. Before Martin McDonagh directed Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri and Seven Psychopaths this was his first movie he directed. And what he gives us is one of my favorite dark comedies since Pulp Fiction. It's so brilliantly written with subtle references to Martin's own version of what heaven and hell looks like, but for the rest of the movie it's far from subtle. He's not afraid to write what's on his mind unlike some script writers who are hesitant because they'll offend someone. Martin gives us his own version of a dark comedy and doesn't try to copy anything from Guy Ritchie or Quentin Tarantino. This movie does a brilliant job of balancing comedy and drama, but even during those drama moments the movie still finds humor. Each of the three main characters bring their own style of humor to the table as they come up with their own version of heaven and hell. Overall this is one of my favorite dark comedies that is definitely worth watching if you're a fan of dark humor.",In Bruges

201,tjsdshpnd,No Novice Blues for Mcdonagh,8,23 October 2009,"This was Martin Mcdonagh's first full fledged movie as a director, but nowhere in the movie, you will find the ""novice"" touch. In Bruges is of the crime comedy/satire genre, which Tarantino, Guy Ritchie etc have excelled in. The story is about two British Hit men Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) who after successfully completing a job in London are sent to Bruges, Belgium by their boss Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes) until the matter as well as the Hit men cool down. Bruges is a tourist destination of sorts for history lovers because it is a well preserved medieval town. But like many European towns, it is very dull and slow for a young fun loving person which Ray is. He hates the place and curses it to the core, wanting to leave it a.s.a.p. On the other hand, Ken loves the feel of the place and considers it a fairytale town and intends to live there until their boss calls. They meet some people there namely a dwarf/midget American actor, a local drug dealer girl etc who make their life in the place interesting. After a while, Ken gets to know from his boss the exact reason why they are in Bruges and the movie takes a different turn altogether. The plot is very engaging and the dialogues very witty and filled with satire. You never get bored during the course of the movie. The movie has many references to Americans, Canadians, Belgians, Englishmen, Vietnamese, Blacks and even Pakistanis with a tone of racism. But it is not 'On The Face' racist comments like in American History X. It is well capsuled in the garb of satire.I have watched very few Colin Farrell movies and this surely was his best performance. He has many shades to his character. He is fun loving, aggressive, sometimes even filled with guilt because of his 'small boy killing' mistake in his first assignment. Brendan Gleeson plays a matured role and his conversations with both Farrell and Fiennes are engrossing. Ralph Fiennes ruled the screen in his short but effective role. A special mention to the Bruges local drug dealer girl and Farrell's love interest in the movie. She had one of the best smiles I have seen. A great watch and I recommend it.Rating : 8/10",In Bruges
202,de_niro_2001,A very original gangster movie,10,3 January 2010,"This film features characters and a plot which one would normally expect to be located in the east end of London. Or if it was about gangsters hiding out in a continental city one would expect it to be Amsterdam. But no, it's Bruges. The plot may seem relatively simple but there are a lot of deeper meanings in the film in the imagery of Bosch paintings and references to religious relics. Bruges is a city well worth visiting which I have been to a couple of times before but for me the city will never be the same again after seeing this film. The film is an 18 certificate and one can see why. Kids who may want to see it because it features four moonlighters from the Harry Potter films should not be allowed to. There is a lot of swearing in it and the scenes where people get shot are quite grisly. There is also one scene which is not for people who suffer from vertigo.

203,beregic,non-conventional thought provoking with no moral barriers,10,16 June 2008,"in quick sentence regarding the plot, this is the story of a man finding it hard to live with himself. at core it is a story about redemption.it is unique in its artistic form, truly emotional and thought revolting.if you are looking for anti-hero characters search no more, you will certainly find those here. i give credits to Martin McDonagh for an excellent direction that combines art( in many forms and dialogs) with absolute reality as how it is perceived or interpreted. the feature contains many rude ""jokes"" and even racism, BUT towards making points that are entirely valid in order to reflect deep sadness or depression for example, rarely seen on the silver screen this days( as of not just going after your emotions as for you to think you ""like"" the movie , but instead for making sure that you will be able to analyze and reflect on your own personal thoughts on certain universal life related problems and/or possible solutions/interpretations).also i am sure that this movie will suffer tons of criticism but that is exactly what makes it special in a true sense; it teaches without preaching, and that alone, for me is a great achievement in being able to understand reality as being perceived from different points of view, other then my own.the above comments are intended for anyone watching the movie entirely; i say this because the introduction is quiet slow but has the point as in making the human mind relax first,as well as normalize the viewer and character's relations to each other. soon after the central character ""Ray"" will intrigue you enough at least to keep your attention and ask your own questions.however after about 30 minutes the plot reveals itself and the ""wachy"" scenes are more and more interesting. the park scene comes to mind as well as the hotel one involving ""hookers"" and racist ""midget"". situations were you can not be sure which sides has less ""evil"", something as ""you do not choose the sides, the sides choose you""...?i think that upholding skin color equality comes before upholding the ""height"" ones, feel free to disagree...also take the restaurant scene as well with the Canadian guy played by Zeljko Ivanek. as a Canadian myself, to me that scene is absolutely hilarious.(as regarding our ""wacky"" smoking ""regulations"" we have in Ontario at least.)as a matter a fact there are quiet a few takes on how north Americans and Europeans perceive each other.as a viewer you will be inclined to pick a side to the ""argument"" no matter what your ""common sense"" political correctness might ""dictate"".i was impressed with Colin Farrell performance here( note that Brendan Gleeson is great as well but the character is ""secondary""). note that i used to completely disliked this actor , considering him a ""porno"" face(where he actually started his career) and as well for such bad performances as in ""s.w.at"" or ""alexander""(where the plot really did not help his cause either). on ""miami vice"" i started thinking that i might had been wrong in my judgment, and after watching this one i realized i certainly been so indeed.Anna Madeley and Clémence Poésy's characters are very sweet and so much ""down to earth"" even if their good lucks enhance the visuals but undermine the conclusions...Ralph Fiennes as harry, the ""mob"" boss, has only a few scenes but very very entertaining ones! as a small example, seeing an Uzi submachine gun on the merchandise table;""an Uzi? i am not from south central Los fu... Angeles.i did not come here to kill 20 black 10-year-olds in a fu... drive-by.i want a normal gun for a normal person"" as about how normal his character is remains open for interpretation))).from the very first scene i noticed that the soundtrack contributes greatly towards an excellent mood defining aspect. while somehow too ""standard"" for its score choices in this feature's genre, it is very efficient in creating an intense ""calm"" mood in general, required for rational thinking, based and in accordance with what the visual shows to the viewer.",In Bruges

The darkness at the heart of even a beautiful place like the touristy city of Bruges is evident, and although the city is shown in all its beauty, I'm ready to believe that there is indeed a seedier side - there always is in any place of beauty.Colin Farrell's performance is excellent, as is Brendan Gleeson and of course Ralph Fiennes. The supporting cast are also very good, and the balance of humour and tragedy is satisfying.

207,c-kelsall,Who says Belgium is boring?,9,23 April 2008,"I saw In Bruges at the cinema last night, and I haven't enjoyed myself so much in ages. Martin McDonagh's film is apparently a first for him, and on the strength of this work he should be schmoozed or lashed into making a lot more. This story of two hit men in the doghouse, holed up in Bruges for two weeks, is as dark a comedy as I've seen in some time, but it works on every level. This beautifully shot film is a wonderful advert for Bruges, Belgium's touristic jewel in the crown, and is accompanied by an excellent score. Brendan Gleason, Colin Farrell and Ralph Fiennes (in a very different kind of role from his usual) are all excellent. Gleason's character is a world-weary, almost fatherly figure, who gives the impression that he's ended up being a hit-man almost by accident. Farrell's character is by turns boorish and childish, yet charming and likable at the same time. The language is frequently crude, but fitting to the characters portrayed here. The story has an inevitability about it, and so there may not be too many surprises for the viewer, but it hardly seems to matter. I can't praise this film too highly, and I urge all adults to see it.",In Bruges
208,insomnia,Another terrific film from the U.K.,8,26 November 2008,"This is the first feature film of director Martin McDonagh. His previous foray into film was the short, ""Six Shooter"" which, come to think of it, would be an ideal addition when ""In Bruges"" is released on DVD. ""In Bruges"" is a superior English gangster film, similar, but not an echo of those two other great English gangster films, ""The Long Good Friday"" and ""Sexy Beast"" Indeed, the Harry Waters character played with venomous realism by Ralph Fiennes is strikingly similar to the Don Logan character (played with even more toxicity by Ben Kingsley), in ""Sexy Beast"" But there is where any resemblance ends. Whereas the ""The Long Good Friday"" was about power and how easily it can slip through one's fingers, and ""Sexy Beast"" was about a retired criminal being persuaded to carry out one last job, ""In Bruges"" is about the aftermath of a 'hit.' Ray and Ken (Farrell and Gleeson respectively), play two hit men. The film opens with postcard scenes of the old city of Bruges in Belgium, while a voice over explains why these two men find themselves in this ancient city. Ken is the more pragmatic of the two. He is quite content to do a spot of 'sightseeing.'while awaiting further instructions. Ray on the other hand, thinks Bruges is a dump. Ray just wants to get back to the city he was born in, Dublin. But, as the film progresses, it's gradually revealed why both men have to hang around, till they receive these 'further instructions.' When the instructions finally comes, is not what we expect. Both Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell, are terrific, especially Farrell as Ray. The supporting cast is equally good  Jordan Prentice as ""Jimmy, Zeljko Ivanek as the 'Canadian"", and Eric Godon as 'Yuri"" There were a few instances in the film I found somewhat confusing  but to list them would be both superfluous, unnecessary, and would spoil other film goers enjoyment. ""In Bruges"" is a rollicking yarn, expertly crafted, with great dialogue and many an unexpected plot twist. I recommend it unreservedly.",In Bruges
209,segacs,"Dark comedy, great dialogue, fantastic setting, but not what you'd expect",7,13 February 2008,"Went to see it for the setting. Loved it for the dialogue. Wished it had just gone a bit further.In Bruges is a dark comedy set in the beautiful medieval town of Bruges, Belgium, featuring an Irish duo of hit men who have been ordered by their boss to hide out there after a high-profile job in London went sour. Their instructions are to keep a low profile, sightsee, and generally avoid trouble until further notice.But all is not as it seems.The dialogue between Gleeson and Farrell is witty, delivered with perfect comic timing, zany, and a joy to watch. Farrell and the charming Clémence Poésy also have great chemistry and are fun to watch on screen. The humour is designed to make viewers uncomfortable, and succeeds remarkably on this count. If you're looking for political correctness, you won't find it here. What you will find are jabs at Americans, tourists, gays, blacks, whites, fat people, and oh yeah, midgets. As this odd assortment of characters mixes and mingles in the streets of Bruges, the tension builds.And there's just enough of a psychological dark edge to keep things interesting. This is a comedy, yes, but it's by no means light and fluffy. This movie has been compared to The Big Hit or The Whole Nine Yards, but in fact, it's much, much darker. And in my opinion, that makes it better.Shot entirely on location in Bruges, the backdrop is of course stunning. I originally went to see this knowing absolutely nothing about it other than the title, simply because, having visited Bruges, I couldn't resist an opportunity to see it on the big screen. Filmed in the wintertime and largely at night, Bruges itself is one of the stars of the movie. Like the other characters, it is not portrayed as light, airy, innocent or picturesque, the way it is in real life. Instead, its more haunting quality is captured elegantly on film, with a heavy mist giving the town a sort of eerie, dream-like quality.So much of this movie was just right, and I highly recommend it to people who like twisted humour and aren't easily offended.I have two issues with this film, however. The first is the score. The music is completely wrong for this movie, giving it a feel that doesn't work at all with the dark comedy tone. The melancholy, slow, stirring music would've worked nicely with a drama or a psychological period piece, but just seems out of place here.The second issue is with the ending. Nope, I won't give it away. Suffice to say, I thought it was wrong, wrong, wrong. All wrong. Almost as though the author couldn't figure out what to do next or how to end this thing.But overall, I really enjoyed In Bruges. It was wickedly funny, daringly different, and fantastically non-PC. And the shots of Bruges are wonderful. Despite what the main characters say about the place, Bruges is really quite wonderful. I suggest seeing both the movie and the city.",In Bruges
210,rayres0708,Yes.,8,8 March 2020,"Everything about this movie is perfect. The writing is absolutely hilarious, even dealing with heavy subject matter. The setting is beautiful. The story is totally original. Brendan Gleeson is a pleasure to watch. Colin Farrell does the best acting I've ever seen him do. Ralph Fiennes is creepy and funny all at once. It's definitely worth a watch.",In Bruges
211,treeskier802,Enjoyable,7,22 August 2008,"I enjoy movies that make a location one of the main themes. In this case, In Bruges, stands apart because of Bruges, which is in Belgium.This is a story of two hit men, with very different personalities, who are sent away to Bruges after a botched job. Bruges, a historically and architecturally interesting city, but which is also rather boring.The writing was good (could have been much better with a few minor adjustments) and the acting of Ferrell, Gleeson, and Fienes was enjoyable. The cinematography of Bruges was top notch. This film was a dark comedy, and was funny, but not THAT funny. The ideology that drove the plot...namely hit men shouldn't kill children, was to me, not that intense of motive for people who chose to be assassins. You would think that at least one of the 3 assassins in the film would not subscribe to that ideology.I was a little put off by the anti-American theme that reared its ugly head throughout the film and by the racist comments by the drug-induced midget. The little person's wild commentary could have focused on something else besides a war between white and black people. Besides, it didn't seem to fit this character's personality at all either, regardless of whether he was on drugs or not. I also found it odd that the only Americans in the film were either overweight or a midget, hence of strange physical proportions. This unfortunate anti-American current made me enjoy the film slightly less than I would have and brought down my rating a tad. A film that at best, could achieve an 8 of 10 stars, I give it 7 of 10 stars due to the anti-American themes. Plus, the story line is simply not believable enough to warrant any higher of a score. With that said, I recommend the film. Ferrell and Gleeson at their best and great cinematography make this film worthwhile.",In Bruges
212,varundelpiero,A welcome surprise...,8,17 February 2009,"In my opinion, Martin McDonagh's directorial debut can easily be classified as a resounding success. From the opening sequence, straight to the (almost too far-fetched) ending, IN BRUGES is full of energy and intrigue. The screenplay is quite brilliant, especially for the first 80-85 minutes or so, mixing elements of comedy, drama, and thriller in a quite enjoyable Motion Picture. The last 10-15 minutes, however, arguably seem rushed, as if McDonagh had almost felt as if he had written himself into the proverbial corner. Some of the events that occur here seem a bit too improbable (at least two such events come to mind) and out-of-touch with the deliberate pacing of the rest of the film. Nonetheless, the Academy saw it fit to nominate his work for Best Original Screenplay, and I personally applaud the nomination, despite the aforementioned flaws.I have always been a fan of Colin Farrell for his performances of unorthodox roles/characters, and this has to be one of his best portrayals in years. Brendan Gleeson is also fantastic as his more level-headed companion, and the synergy between the lead characters is quite awesome. Ralph Fiennes reprises another villainous role, and does so quite superbly. In all, the casting was excellent, as the characters manage to enhance the already brilliant screenplay. Moreover, the cinematography and score are very good, with the scenic shots of Bruges enhancing the overall atmosphere of the film.IN BRUGES is full of memorable scenes and lines, undoubtedly accentuated by the Irish tongues of Farrell and Gleeson. Worthy of multiple viewings. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 200 at 183. Highly recommended.",In Bruges
213,birck,A decent film with some problems,7,9 March 2008,"I have to agree with most of the main points in the positive reviews of this film: The script is great, Brendan Gleason, Colin Farrell, Ralph Feinnes and the Flemish actors are excellent, and the setting is used well. The Burghers of Bruges can expect a spike in the numbers of large, overweight, English-speaking American tourists, thanks to this film. But the thumbs-down reviewers also make good points: Colin Farrell mugs a lot; the arc of the story is predictable once the boss (Fiennes) places his call to Ken (Gleason); the climax at the tower is hard to believe; The bullet-riddled ending is equally hard to believe, and reminiscent of the ending of The Departed (equally unconvincing). The film is full of quotes and paraphrases from past films: a medieval square in Bruges' Altstaat at night comes straight out of The Third Man; One character deliberately shoots another in the thigh, reminiscent of Brendan Gleason's signature work, The General; The final scene is a paraphrase of the final scene of the Coen brothers' Blood Simple.There's a point that jumped out at me that hasn't been raised yet-there are two or three gags at the expense of Americans in the film. That wouldn't really be objectionable but for the fact that some of the gags are conflated with racism. I can't object to jokes at our expense ( I am an American), since there's a germ of truth in every one of them. The racism, however, is gratuitous. We don't need this movie to tell us it's a problem. Speaking-again, as an American, racism-in-America cropped up enough times in this film to draw my attention away from the story itself. After the first two or three mentions, I was sitting there waiting for the next anti-American racist gag.So, on the whole I scored the film 9 for production values, and 4 for..what?, Rudeness? Resulting in a 7 star rating.",In Bruges

To call this film a comedy is like calling ""Rear Window"" a comedy. A few (few) jokes, and some strange characters do not make a comedy.This film is about suicide, death, killing of innocent children, guilt and hopelessness. Just what people find funny about this eludes me.The ""un-PC"" dialog seemed forced and unfunny.Regarding the thriller/drama/crime aspect, I was never engaged with the characters and every plot twist could be seen 20 minutes before hand.I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed with a film.As a straight drama/thriller, the film put me to sleep.

As for the performances, well Colin Farrell's is absolutely top notch. For an actor whose work, so far, has seen highs and lows this is a notable high point.

People that hold a gun on someone close enough for them to take it away. A supposedly professional killer walking through a park with his weapon held in his hand for all to see.

The film deals with the duality of these two killers and their disparities of how they will find their self redemption.The elements of the film are constantly ambiguous by intention, providing moments of extreme seriousness inside sensitive matters, and eventually creating boost of laughters across tense moments.All the characters are built to hug and kiss and kill you, in their own way. The lines given by the actors are pure brilliancy and are intelligently spoken by the script (read duality and ambiguous for ""given"" and ""spoken"").I am desperately trying to remember a movie as good as In Bruges, but right now all I can think is Monsieur Hire by Patrice Leconte to compare with this one as far as its deepness and simplicity to story tell.I believe this film will get some serious attention this year for it has the right look of a winner, with the heart of a happy loser (read ""winner and loser"" as least competitive as you can).Enjoy this beauty!",In Bruges
221,Reel_starz,In Bruges is a must-see!!!,8,25 April 2009,"Bruges is a fairytale. It's also in Belgium. We are repeatedly reminded of both these facts throughout the movie In Bruges, a dark comedy that isn't afraid to push the envelope on topics ranging from hit men and religion to midgets (no, dwarfs!), racism and tourist etiquette. This movie is not for the queasy or the easily offended as the violence is grisly and the jokes dance in the glory that is un-Politically Correctness.However, don't get me wrong, there is a lot that is easy to like about In Bruges. First, the scenery is gorgeous and the picturesque, quiet town serves as a delightful backdrop and foil to the story, which is at times pleasantly crude. After watching this movie, many feel a strong desire to visit Bruges and even I, a tourist more like Ray in taste than Ken, admit that there is a strange, almost magical appeal to the town. Indeed, often, it truly does feel like a fairytale place, especially when contrasted to the violence and pitch-black humor that fills much of the film.Secondly, the cast is absolutely flawless. As Ray, Colin Farrell brings an odd sort of charisma that immediately endears his character to the hearts of the viewers. Ray could easily have been overly rude and obnoxious, but instead, it is almost impossible not to like him and care about what happens to him. In this movie, Colin Farrell has perfect comedic timing and expressions that are, alternately, hilarious and touching and he proves that he can indeed act, something which many - including me - have known for a long time, and reminds the world why he reached A-list status at the ripe age of 25. As Ken, Ray's perfect foil, Brendan Gleeson brings a more subtle brilliance to the screen, lending his character a sort of quiet dignity that is rare in hit men, even those in the movies. In addition to their pitch-perfect performances, what really makes the friendship between Ray and Ken work is the undeniable chemistry between the actors. Also, it must be said that even though he appears in less than half of the movie, Ralph Fiennes gives a memorable performance and is, in turns, hilarious and menacing. The supporting cast is worth noting and, especially Jordan Prentice and Clemence Posey, does an excellent job of, well, supporting the main actors.The next most noteworthy aspect of In Bruges is the nearly flawless direction and writing by Martin McDonagh. This is McDonagh's first feature film (he is most known for his theater work and for winning the Oscar for the short film Six Shooter) and it is a better debut than almost anyone could ask for. There is barely a line of the dialogue that is unquotable and perhaps even more remarkable is the way McDonagh seamlessly blends all the elements of In Bruges. The action, comedy, romance and drama work together in perfect balance, giving the movie a unique and unforgettable feel. Also, while it is undeniably hilarious, it is the emotion that really makes In Bruges stand out, as well as the subtle message of redemption and friendship.",In Bruges
222,GLanoue,The cityscape as the main protagonist,9,13 March 2011,"As usual, a great script is the basis for this great film. The story turns on a series of highly improbable circumstances (which I won't mention to not spoil the enjoyment), but the script has managed to flesh out the characters sufficiently well that we even come to expect them, or at least regard them as normal in context. The camera work is excellent, with long, static shots of the cityscape, and with zooms reserved mostly for people shots, so we unconsciously accept how Bruges and its Medieval architecture becomes a powerful player in the story, and the protagonists' life and death decisions and actions (this is a crime and morality play, so I can safely reveal that there is a certain level of violence) seem almost arbitrary and meaningless compared to the permanence and therefore emotional force of the constructed landscape against which the action takes place. In fact, the script acknowledges this several times, since the protagonists in several crucial moments actually stop shooting each other to allow themselves to change locales that they think are more appropriate (the tower on the main square is the most importance example, though at least one scene involves Bruges' famous canals). Other normally important actions – there's a great scene with one criminal, a dwarf and two prostitutes in a nondescript hotel room – are interrupted or are inconclusive. It's as if meaningful action can only take place against the backdrop of the city's public places. David Lean's films, especially Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago, also tended to transform the environment from simple backdrop into an active protagonist. In Bruges does it in a much more subtle yet strangely effective manner, which is perhaps as it should be since the life and death situations in which the protagonists find themselves are all the result of venal, morally disgusting and illegal activities. The city, unbeknown to them, works its magic (despite that Ray one of the killers on the lam describes it as a ""shithole"") and brings each of them to their just desserts, hell or redemption, or perhaps both. All in all, an extremely well-crafted film that makes believable the improbable and underscores the futility of individual human action (cities are the symbol of the entire community par excellence). I haven't mentioned the actors, but Colin Farell's excesses for once are used to good effect, and Ralph Fiennes and Brendan Gleason are excellent as usual, and the excellent and underplayed script allows the secondary actors to shine as well. All in all, a great little movie. Life and Death in L.A. makes sense, in America, but here, life and death have strangely little effect or impact, since the location makes it such that life or death are almost predestined and thus meaningless as individual destinies.",In Bruges

The trailer for this film did nothing to interest me, but I finally saw it based on a glowing recommendation.

Its success hinges greatly on the performance and chemistry of its two leads, Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, and both do phenomenal jobs (especially Farrell) helped by a witty script by Martin McDonagh. It had a very ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"" feel to it. Colin Farrell's role is an excellent departure from his usual characters, this one odd, hilarious, and almost child-like. I would love to see him (and Brendan Gleeson) score Oscar nominations for their performances in this film... but they won't.",In Bruges

Two hit men wandering around aimlessly is not really my type of thing but the script is so clever that you somehow end up marveling at the whole ridiculous story. I never cared much for Farrell as an actor - he always seems to be playing these annoying schmucks - but here he's just hilarious. Especially the way he plays off Brendan Gleeson's character. He is sooooooo bored out of his skull by being in Bruges that you almost feel sorry for him.

""In Bruges"" has Dialog up the wazoo. There haven't been this many black comedy one-liners in one film since ""Pulp Fiction."" All three of the principal actors are superb, with each revealing new facets of their talents I had not suspected before, even though I know their work well. Most impressive in a way is Colin Farrell, finally rescued from the handsome male lead ghetto and given some lines to really chew on. And chew he does...his Ray makes up for with scathing wit what he lacks in subtlety. The subtlety belongs to Brendan Gleeson, who manages to transcend both his character Ken's profession (hit man) and his background to explore the art, culture, and philosophy that he finds in Bruges. Ray thinks Bruges is Hell; Ken finds it a kind of Heaven. And the third surprise in this film is Ralph Fiennes, a very, very different Ralph Fiennes than we see in *his* handsome male lead ghetto roles.Martin McDonagh has been called ""the most famous Oscar-winning director you've never heard of,"" based on his win for a short called ""Six Shooter."" I've seen that film, and it's even darker in its way than ""In Bruges."" But it's that Irish kind of dark that is full of humor. Black humor, admittedly, but humor nonetheless. And, like ""Pulp Fiction,"" if you can get beyond the surface characters and what they are and what they do for a living, and focus on what they're SAYING, the humor is side-splitting.

However, after seeing Brendan Gleeson (Ken) and Colin Farrell (Ray) explore and then engage in a series of violent incidents all over the gorgeous medieval city of Bruges, it has suddenly moved near the top of my must-see list in Europe.The very fact that even after seeing a body tumble out of a clock tower and fall in a bloody squelch on the cobblestones the idea of climbing the clock tower still remains appealing speaks to Bruges's beauty. The movie itself is a journey through both the city as well as the depth of human guilt and depravity. It includes romance and action, humor and tragedy.It definitely has its faults. The sequencing of gun fights near the end seemed to be built around what was convenient for the plot, not what would actually make any sense. It is, however, a well-done movie overall, and one that deserves to be seen by more than just people on the train to Bruges.(I saw this on June 28, 2017.)",In Bruges
234,garrettderose,"Bruges, I love you",9,28 October 2009,"This movie is beautifully shot and beautifully cast. I was extremely impressed from start to finish. I believe this is the first role of Colin Farrell's that I enjoyed and felt moved by. Ralph Fiennes is always surprising and edges more and more into my list of favorite actors. The guy who plays Ken is barely three-dimensional. He seems very 'normal' compared to the other characters.The film, as you know, is set in the small Dutch town of Bruges. It's an old Medieval tourist town that is seemingly unimpressive to the common person at first glance.Bruges serves as a sort of purgatory for the two protagonists of the film. They are informed to 'lay low' in Bruges and to wait for a call from their employer. The two main characters spend their time exploring the town to pass time. They don't anticipate the danger is right around the corner, their employer being extremely disappointed in their last job.This small town in the middle of nowhere turns into a battlefield, some gladiators battling for honor - some for survival.Lots of laughs, but don't let the comedic aspect overshadow the dark and real subject matter that looms over the two characters. There are many serious themes that are brought very realistically to the screen: Regret, Atonement, Depression, Suicide, Honor killing.Oh yeah, and there's a midget. Score! 9/10",In Bruges
235,orangeisthenewawesome,What a great movie,9,24 August 2008,"Occasionally the accents are a bit thick and the f-word is used a bit gratuitously for my taste, but aside from that I LOVED In Bruges. This movie has first rate performances, a well written script, a lovely locale (I thought Bruges was adorable), fascinating characters, and most importantly, a lot of heart. This movie accomplishes the difficult task of enabling the viewer to connect emotionally with murderers. However, the movie never becomes sappy thanks to again, great acting and emotionally powerful scenes that are shot and directed well.Colin Farrell is an acting powerhouse. Nice work by all the main players. A highly recommended, very entertaining film. See it!",In Bruges
236,sheepmonk2000,Brilliant,8,11 May 2011,"This film is simply...brilliant. From the cinematography to the dialogue to the acting, each area of this film is done to perfection. The story is brilliant, the acting is genuine and the script is hilarious. Enjoy! I hate to go on and on about how good this film is but apparently you must write 10 lines of text, so that's the reason why I'm elaborating on my (original) first paragraph......the best thing about this film for me was definitely Ralph Fienes - his comedic timing is top notch. Warning: This film is violent.The films dialogue is quick, sharp, and very very witty. Colin Farrel is superb - his crying is really heartfelt as is his understandable grieve over a major plot device that occurs early on the film. Although this film is brilliant, I have only given it 4* as oppose to 5* as I felt the film became a little drawn out towards the end. Plus, I would have preferred a more conclusive ending that the one that was presented to the audience. Despite this the film is still great and one I would certainly recommend any person(s) reading this review to check out.",In Bruges
237,doug-697,Hit-man with a conscience,9,18 February 2008,"This black comedy is not for the faint of heart. It is at times very violent. Also, there is drug use and sex between unmarried adults.I believe there is a misconception about some reviews I've seen of this movie. This isn't a movie about two hit men. The character played by Colin Farrell is only an attempted-hit-man. My feeling was he was playing a person who did have a violent past, but he was not a psychopath like any professional hit-man would have to be. He likely thought that as a hit-man he would only be killing bad people, but his first ""hit"" goes terribly wrong and this movie is about the guilt he feels from that. If you've ever made a mistake in your life with terrible consequences, you'll be able to relate to his character. Farrell does a great job in this movie, and nobody does ""brooding"" like he can.There is tremendous drama in the movie, but it is still a comedy. Most of the comedy comes from Farrell, but Ray Fienes is also hilarious as the boss who IS a psychopath.Another movie out this year dealing with hit men is No Country for Old Men. Personally, I think this movie is better.",In Bruges

239,zofos,I'm Bruised (2008),2,8 August 2008,"This is a thinly-disguised rip-off of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. Instead of John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson as the hit-men, we have Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson. In Pulp Fiction, John Travolta's character was just back from Amsterdam; here Farrell and Gleason are just over the Dutch border in Bruges, Belgium. Like Jackson and Travolta, Farrell and Gleason spend most of their time arguing about trivial things. There is also drug-taking as in Tarantino's movie, but this film is non-league compared to Pulp Fiction's Premiership status.As in Pulp Fiction, the hit-men work for a scary Mr. Big character, here played by Ralph Fiennes (in one of his worst performances) instead of Ving Rhames. Fiennes has clearly seen Ben Kingsley's performance in ""Sexy Beast"" and he's tried to pitch his performance at the same hysterical level. The difference is that Kingsley had some terrific dialogue to say in his film, where Fiennes just screams the F-word so often here that you just wish he'd shut up after a while. Fiennes also seems to be doing a Peter Cook impression, using the same nasal, whiny intonations of the late comic genius. He's terrible in it, but the script has to take some of the blame for that too.If you like making fun of midgets, as the writer of this film seems to, then this movie is for you. The so-called ""jokes"" about little people aren't funny and they become repetitive and offensive after a while. If midgets were the funniest subject in the world, then this movie would be the best comedy of all time, but they're not and it isn't. It's a failed stab at humour that's poorly executed.The script was written by a playwright and, like a play, it's all talk and no action. Every second word is the F-word in a desperate bid at humour; you become numb to it after a while. Ralph Fiennes shows up at the end to try and liven things up, but by then it's too late to care. This is an overrated mess of a movie.",In Bruges

One of these men falls head over heels in love with an average-looking woman whom he somehow, for inexplicable reasons, finds absolutely stunning. This man also happens to have low self-esteem, which is so typical of a bad guy (???).I don't know what I'm watching.

241,bobcolganrac,A Most Interesting Blend,9,3 February 2009,"I think what impressed me most about this movie is something the actors all say in the one bonus feature of the DVD: it captures and expresses the humanity of the characters no matter what they may be or do. Somehow even in the worst of behavior they are still very real, very human, very complex, flawed and noble simultaneously. I really like this film. I liked the premise: two shady guys from the 20th Century on the lam in a perfectly preserved Medieval city whose sureness of architectural line and composition stands in stark contrast to their uncertainty and fear and collective guilt. The stately orderly beauty of the buildings which sit on the cobble stone streets or border the canal with its swans which wends its way through the heart of the city of Bruges and passes under its many small arched bridges create a sense of composure and timelessness. A sense of time frozen as in a Master painting . . . The setting of Bruges as calm backdrop to these frenzied visitors is quite purposeful for the writer/director to allow the mood of incongruity to add to the dark humor. One doesn't really see the trappings of modernity at all. Cars and trucks are almost nonexistent, and even though the boats have motors you don't hear them. It could well be the 14th Century. What we hear instead is the noise of the invading people whose orderliness is fairly nonexistent. The background is still, the people in motion, an emphasis of the tension within the characters. I believe that nothing here is brand new but cleverly adapted by Martin McDonagh from certain works. While not a cut and paste of other offerings, it borrows heavily from works that are cited either directly or indirectly and most notably the 1970 British film ""Performance,"" which featured a criminal on the lam hiding in a very strange old mansion inhabited by people living a lifestyle very different than the one he knew. Part of the allure of that film was that strange juxtaposition of personae who seemed from other worlds. The other work that ""In Bruges"" borrows from is Roeg's classic ""Don't Look Now"" which featured a child/dwarf and the canaled streets and empty facades of the ancient buildings of Venice. Where that movie had a creepiness, this one transposes humor and a dark lightness. Where Roeg used the ambiance of Venice to create an insecurity for characters and audience, the lovely tranquility of Bruges serves to calm the viewer, even though the on screen characters are running at emotional redline. It is also worth noting that the citizens of Bruges are portrayed mostly as in neutral, non-involved. Even when things get out of hand, they maintain a calm very much at odds with the adrenalized British/Irish protagonists. It is most clever how McDonagh takes us into a movie within a movie while paying homage to the fantasied works of Heironymus Bosch. He suggests that there may a quantity of insanity in the film industry with its fictional depiction of reality, and that no one is immune from being part of that distorted sanity who is participating in any way with cinema, whether as makers, actors, or spectators. His replication through costuming of Bosch figures into the film within film also suggests that every work of art only issues from the mind of a creator, fiction given form.What is well done is McDonagh's use of language. His script sparkles and breathes strongly. None of the lines delivered by any of the characters fail to delight. He pokes fun at language through his characters' use of certain words and phrases, such as ""alcove"" to mean ""nooks and crannies."" A great deal of the likability of this movie for me comes from the script, and I might say that I acted pre-emptively and put on the captioning when I realized that the characters were speaking British English which is far different than American English. It helped to see, and hear what they were saying the better to not miss the nuances of a well done script.Cast is very good. Most impressive was Brendan Gleeson, who has a truly wonderful camera presence here. Fiennes is very very good as gang leader Harry Water, (another nod to Roeg's criminal boss in ""Performance,"" Harry Flowers), while Farrell does an admirable job all the way through. Farrell obviously enjoyed himself on this one. There were a couple of times when his facial contortions went places I don't think Farrell knew where they were. Great fun.Rest of cast did what they had to do, and did it well. Lighting, mood, sound were all supportive and well placed. Overall, a very nice dark comedy, and one well worth recommending to others. Given the beauty of the background scenery, I wish I had seen this in a theater, not on DVD at home. Still beautiful on the small screen. A bit bloody though, not for the squeamish or young children. Grade 9 stars.",In Bruges
242,Syrchek,Hit men with a conscience.,8,12 October 2008,"Great, sad, brutal, funny, pardon me, I meant f***n' funny, are the first things that I can think of just after seeing this quite simple but effective movie. As the title says In Bruges, the story is set in a medium-sized Belgium town with a very rich historical background, an earthly paradise for tourists of a more ""cultural"" type. Just one of the last places on earth where you would put a story that involves professional hit men.""Bruges dangerous"" doesn't seem to make any sense, but there are enough elements thrown in that make this concept work so well, you almost wish to go there someday for yourself. But let's face it, off-screen Bruges itself must really be kind of boring if you are not a ""cultural"" fan, that's why it is apt to throw in American dwarfs, movie scenes, prostitutes, drug dealers, some of the crudest humor you can think of, etc, all that to go with those Gothic churches and make the story more exciting to follow.But what also makes it appealing is that our two protagonists, especially Farrel with his bleak feelings, almost couldn't blend better with the cold, dark and depressive atmosphere of the town. But like most good comedies this film also builds it's story on certain contrasts. And the main contrasts that seems to exists is this notion of hit men that have a sort of a conscience, which is what it's all about. And I have to say that at times this idea does seem a little unbelievable, but without it the bleakness and guilt would disappear, the atmosphere wouldn't have it's effect and the story would have to be mostly rewritten.Yet this is clearly not a motion picture for everyone, since the R rating is very much in place. It isn't always a plus, because there seems to be just a scene or two that is almost ridiculously violent and that mildly spoils the otherwise very, very thoughtful story.",In Bruges
243,OutsideHollywoodLand,A Crisp Thriller,10,2 February 2010,"Imagine Christmas in a medieval European town, complete with cathedrals, graceful swans gently gliding along on a river – ""a fairyland"" – as one character describes the setting for In Bruges, a film starring Colin Farrell, Bredan Gleeson, and Joseph Fiennes. Yet before we get too comfortable with the view, don't forget we're talking about a Colin Farrell movie here. The fairyland setting begins to ring false almost from the moment our two mismatched characters, Ken and Ray, stumble into Bruges, a quaint little town in Belgium. Ken and Ray have been abruptly ordered by their boss, Harry, to lay low in Bruges, following a routine hit gone very wrong for two weeks. As the boys settle into their hotel, sharing a room instead of being in separate rooms, even we get the hint that nothing will be going quite the way either of them wants. I must say that Colin Farrell's raw-ready portrayal of a tightly wound, would-be hit man, gives me renewed faith in his talents and his current career choices. (Apparently, so did the Golden Globes 2009!) As a man running from his boss, his past misdeeds, and his failed life, Farrell's performance commands us to feel more deeply for Ray than he may actually feel for himself. Awash in overwhelming guilt and remorse for an accident cloaked within a heinous crime, Ray careens through his involuntary vacation of high-brow culture and low-lifes for which his partner and friend, Ray must woefully shoulder. Ray, played by Brenden Gleeson, serves as a steady counter-point to his strung-out partner. Gleeson is a quiet marvel of studied self-control. His Ray is at once genial and half-mocking, only to reveal a kindred ranting soul, seething at the injustices of his world, which forces him to make unpleasant choices that he can't neatly rationalize and would rather not face at all. A deft supporting cast and subtle directing blend to lift this sharp little Indie film to a three-reeler for me. The only weakness for In Bruges is the screenplay, which at time wants to bludgeon us with the sin vs. redemption theme overandoverandover again. The triteness of Harry's final act almost ruins Ray's bittersweet hope for his future for us.",In Bruges

I'm used to seeing him in films like The Constant Gardener or The English Patient. This departure from those roles had me grinning from ear to ear as I watched.Colin Farrell, though, was truly magnificent. He played his role to the hilt. His childish affectations and facial expressions were such a treat.

246,youngman44,Dramedy in Bruges,9,16 January 2009,"An excellent film. Extremely subtle and humorous. Not everyone will like this film. It's not fast paced or action packed. However, the acting is exceptional and it is filled with both humor and sober thoughts on life, death and guilt. Colin Farrell has undoubtedly offered up his finest performance in film. Farrell has been decent in other films but this role was filled with humor and vulnerability. The acting during a conversation at breakfast with Brendan Gleeson in the hotel is priceless; so, too, Farrell's attempt to get a date with the lovely and wonderfully attractive Clemence Poesy. Gleeson himself is excellent as well as a brief but very poignant role by Ralph Fiennes. The Golden Globe nominations of Gleeson and Farrell for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy were well deserved. In my view, Farrell should get a Best Actor nomination for the Academy; it is not a winning role. But, it is phenomenal acting. I doubt he'll get a nomination given the Academy's melodrama fetish. However, I will guarantee that Farrell's role is better than two or three of the roles. Farrell takes small scenes with good dialog and makes it exceptional. The various views of Bruges are very nice; the movie captures very well life in a mid-sized European town. The main square the hotel and its breakfast area all are captured quite well. The screenplay is equal to Farrell's acting. There are great statements about life and choices one makes - as well as great humor. To be able to explore both with equal aplomb in a film is quite an achievement. The screenplay for this movie is also quite deserving of an Oscar nomination. The one slight negative I would have is that I might have changed around a couple of scenes near the end, but that's always the writer's prerogative. Finally, the language is pretty rough at times. However, this seems essential for a legitimate portrayal of the characters. Unless you can only handle mindless action films (don't get me wrong - those have their place!) or fast action dramas - you should enjoy this movie.",In Bruges
247,MiloMindbender,Director dropped the ball on this one,5,16 April 2009,"Beautiful scenes of Bruges & an above average performance by Farrell can not save this clunker. For starters every line in this movie sounds like it was written for maximum irony or humor. There isn't a single line that sounds like something someone in such a scenario would actually say. Secondly, every plot development is predictable & completely implausible. If it's true that Bruges has no police & that no one in Bruges ever calls the police when crimes are committed, it would seem to be reasonable to conclude that Bruges would be the hub of criminal activity in Europe. But it's not, & people's behavior in this movie is just completely implausible, from beginning to end. The director so obviously drags out the final scene, with what is probably supposed to increase tension for the viewer, but it's really just tiresome. How many times does he have to shoot the Farrel character & not do it? How many times does the Farrel character have to get away but just stand there to what for him to catch up? It has all the subtlety of a film student's final project. Finally, Ralph Fiennes can't act & he's particularly atrocious in this thing. I'm surprised by all the praise heaped on this, rather derivative ""hip"" gangster flick, but then again the quality here on IMDb really has taken a nosedive over the past decade. If flashy, hip gangsta films are your thing then maybe you'll enjoy this, but if you really want to laugh ""lock stock & 2 smoking barrels"" has many more laughs & feels more natural than this thing (in spite of its more implausible scenarios).",In Bruges
248,jackharding89-1,Paddy power...,9,26 April 2008,"Having bagged the Oscar for best short film four years back with his dark humoured thriller Six Shooter, London born director Martin McDonagh steps up to the big screen with this: In Bruges; an incisive and bloody fierce laugh-out-loud revamp of his 27 minute short debut. Starring an inform Collin Farrell, In Bruges is set...well...in Bruges: a tucked-away Belgian town that's both easy-on-the-eye and peaceful. Until now. Hired Irish hit men Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) have been sent to the small medieval town following a botched job where they're to keep their heads low and wait for word from Harry (Ralph Fiennes). But why Belgium? And why the hell Bruges?While waiting for Harry's instructions, Ray and Ken encounter more than their fair share of problems and misfits, prostitutes and elephants, Canadians, thieves, gunmen, xenophobes and racist midgets. Their overseas waiting game soon becomes one laden with toe-curling hilarity yet mystery, anguish and philosophy as the two hired guns share a few home truths regarding the nature of their so-called profession, the blood of Christ, the beauty of Bruge, lollipop men who know kung-fu and the unfolding events of recent times that have led them to this shat- hole.When Ray's not p*ssed, he's p*ssed off. With every one and everything. He's a bearded, doughy, chauvinistic paddy who rarely passes up a chance to make a harsh yet hilarious example of society's minorities while keeping his middle finger held high and firm in the face of political correctness. ""I believe that the balance shall tip in the favour of culture, like a big fat fcuking retarded fcuking a black girl on a see- saw with a midget on the other fcuking end.""Lamping two Yanks in the name of the Vietnamese and John Lennon won't sit too pretty with many neither, nor will the four or five dozen uses of the dreaded c-word. But the sheer vigour, acid-tongued brilliance of McDonagh's dialogue is channelled so effectively through Farrell that it not only makes for a genuinely believable and, somehow, likable character, but also the Irishman's best performance in years. The role of Ray fits him like a glove and will go a long way to re-establishing his faded reputation in eyes of many. Gleeson is also superb. Chipping in with a solid, father-like supporting role, the experienced screen vet' gives a performance of a dead beat bloke in whom regret, honour and an estranged sense of decency suffer a series of head on collisions. Then there's Ralph Fiennes; the intense and steely-eyed method actor who's pure and utter dynamite as the scornful, dirty Harry. His turn ushers in the bloody final third of McDonagh's medieval morality-play.His multi-layered plot remains unwavering and steady throughout featuring just enough well placed hooks to keep audiences interested. The sheer weight and wit of McDonagh's smartly scripted dialogue is what gives Bruges its muscle, though. Rarely does it cease to entertain or amuse, shock or transgress. It's both rare in style and scandalous in content. You know full-well you shouldn't conform to the shallowness of the humour. You know you shouldn't laugh. But you do anyway. Violent, vicious, bloody funny, brilliantly executed and surprisingly touching: In Bruges is as fine a film you're likely to see this side of Pulp Fiction. It's a merciless, pin-sharp feature from the big screen débutant with a big heart that barks like a p*ssed paddy on st. Patrick's day and bites like a Reservoir Dog set loose in Bruges.",In Bruges
249,gring0,"Terrific film, great dialogue, laugh-aloud moments",9,29 June 2008,"Reading through these comments, one is struck by how much goodwill there is to this film. One would think that only those with their noses out of joint would bother writing negative comments, but to have the overwhelming reaction positive shows how engaging this film is. To have Colin Farrell as the star would normally stop me from sitting in front of the telly to watch him for 90 minutes but he provides a sympathetic, nuanced performance without going over the top which would have been understandable given the storyline. Gleeson is given ample screen time to show why he's one of Ireland's great thespians. I was first introduced to him in the film 'I Went Down;' although I can't for the life of me remember that film apart from the nonsensical reason given for the title, I do remember Gleeson's performance as a revelation that single-handedly raised an otherwise non-descript film. And Fiennes once again shows no matter the genre, he'll step up and nail it. His accent is spot-on; I thought for a minute they'd hired Michael Caine to phone in a cameo when I first heard his voice. The plot itself is nothing to get worked up over, and the various turns used to stretch out the film are a bit laboured but, with the sublime humour and great dialogue, it doesn't matter. And what a setting! My main issue was the ending where it rather fell apart for me in terms of believability, but it is truly minor compared to everything that makes up this movie. This is definitely worth an evening in to watch. www.lairdkeir.spaces.live.com",In Bruges
250,DaveDiggler,Fear and Loathing In Bruges,9,12 June 2008,"Martin McDonagh, in his first feature film, has created one hell of an introduction. The movie is not complex, at first, as two hit men are sent to Bruges to wait for their orders after a hit goes terribly wrong. Bruges is in Belgium, by the way. It's a beautiful medieval city that lifts off the screen with gorgeous cinematography. It's hard to imagine a city so aesthetically pleasing with its towers, canals, and scenery that most would cherish. One of the hit men is Ray (Colin Farrell) and the other is Ken (Brenden Gleeson). Ray finds Bruges to be old and boring while Ken admires the architecture with wondrous eyes. As they wait for their orders we have a lot of comedic banter with a setting Quentin Tarantino could write dialogue for days with. It takes about twenty minutes into the film when the action and the plot start to pull all the strings together with a hit; in a church of all places. This is Ray's first hit. The scene starts, through a flashback, with Ray confessing to a murder that will take place in the not so distant feature. He tells the priest, ""I've murdered someone."" The priest asks, ""Who did you murder?"" Ray responds with, ""You, Father."" As the bullets start to fly a life is taken. More importantly an innocent life - a young boy's life. The boy is on his knees as he just finished writing his confession for all the bad things he did.This sets into place a string of events involving characters recognizing their own absurdity in certain situations (they call them principles). The humor is dark and extremely effective, mostly coming from Ray. At some point in the film, I was laughing so hard I missed the next lines. It truly is laugh-out-loud funny. Farrell is perfect with his childish delivery, batting eyebrows and high pitched squeaking sounds to emphasize certain words. Farrell does an excellent job as and makes you feel for his characters pain immensely as he agonizes over the little boy's death. Both of these actors work exceptionally well off one another and both give heart felt performances. Do hit men such as these have moral boundaries? Do they cross them? Do they stand by their word, and more importantly, do they do what they say they would do when the gun is put to their own head? Ethics would never come into play with hit men in most films, but these men have boundaries and their word means something to them. Henry (Ralph Fiennes) is the leader of these two hit men and he sent both to Bruges to wait for his orders after the tragic hit in the church. For the first 2/3 of the film we only hear him over the phone and he brings dark humor into the picture as well. The writing is fantastic as certain characters constantly repeat themselves and say the same thing multiple times. It sounds musical and so rhythmic with the delivery and the repetition. Fiennes is terrific. He and Ken have a couple of great scenes together in the final act. It's acting at its finest. The direction overall is extremely well done. After the film settles in it takes off and most of that is due in large part by the gorgeous cinematography and the great score lifting the film to the heights that it will stay at for the rest of the film. As the film progresses it gets better and better and better. You'll find yourself gradually becoming more and more involved with the outcome of the characters. ""In Bruges"" is a dark and funny film that's engaging till the end with an engrossing plot and characters. The best movie of 2008.",In Bruges

Additionally, the film transitions competently between comedic and serious moments, and has a number of appreciated (though not entirely unanticipated) plot twists. In Bruges is undoubtedly funnier than any of McDonagh's more recent work, but lacks the standout moments of Psychopaths.",In Bruges
253,grantbullert,Completely Unique,8,9 August 2018,"""In Bruges"" is a charming, yet dark film. It rides the line of comedy and drama. It is a film that is sure to keep you on your toes. The storytelling is of a rare breed in modern cinema, and because of this it is easy to appreciate.-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The absurdity of the story of Ray and Ken is what makes it so charming. Two dangerous men spend some time together in a quaint town called Bruges after a job goes wrong. It all seems a bit peculiar but oddly it feels real. It is humorous and unprofessional, but seems as if these characters are real. We are drawn in an easily invested into their situation. Martin McDonagh keeps the tone under wraps all throughout the film. When something gets to be too ridiculous, he tones it down and brings some seriousness to the scene. When things get too serious for their own good he brings in some more ridiculous humor. He is in total command of the tone of the film and he nails it all the way through. *Cinematography/Editing: The look of the film is one of bleakness and beauty, mirroring the views of Ray and Ken. Eigil Bryld ties these two worldviews together visually in such a beautiful manner. The sequencing of the film is high energy. There is never a dull moment or lapse in storytelling. Each scene pushes into the next and is filled with wonderful moments. *Dialogue/Acting: Here is yet another fantastic part of the film. There are lovely quips all throughout the film, but they do not feel forced or out of place. They add to the absurdity of the film, but also its charm. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are a wonderful on screen pair. They had remarkable chemistry and they very much brought the film to life. Ralph Fiennes plays a dangerous and inconsistent crime boss. He shifts from stupidity to sternness in a split second and it is incredible. *Music/Sound: Perhaps one of the low points of the film, the music doesn't always seem to fit the mood of what is being portrayed on screen. Although, this could just be another aspect of the chaotic story we are presented with. The sound design is full of beauty and ugliness. There are a few scenes that turn out poorly for our heroes, and the sound design adds to the level of pain we feel. *Production Design/Special Effects: The sets and locations of Bruges are a marvel to behold. They are full of wonder while still being rather bland. The special effects are adequate for the film. They draw no attention to themselves, positive or negative, save one rather gruesome scene.*Conclusion: ""In Bruges"" is a film of great wonder and excitement, but also bleakness. There is much to ponder about after viewing it. It is a crazy ride all the way through and is one that is sure to be enjoyed by audiences with a quirky taste.",In Bruges
254,terryzhangtianrun,A story of three gentlemen,8,23 July 2020,"This story is about a porfessional killer named Ray, his partner Ken, and their boss called Harry. They are sent to Bruges to wait for the order of mission. However, on the third day Harry told Ken to kill Ray because Ray killed a child once on a mission. Harry can't tolerate that someone killed an innocent child. The story is quite amusing and it shows the kind behaviours of an English gentleman although the movie might be exaggerating about it.
Harry choose to bring Ray and Ken to Bruges because he believes it's a good place to visit with medival buildings. He manages to make Ray see the place where Harry loves before Ray dies.",In Bruges
255,Alex-Tsander,Comical and absurd yet profoundly thought provoking.,9,20 March 2015,"I started watching this with my usual scepticism: ""Probably yet another Brit Gangster movie attempting to tread where much better has gpne before"" I thought. Well, not in such words, but that sums up my expectation.I soon realised how far from the case this is. The movie is quite original. The characters are compelling. The script is of that quality you do not notice because it seems totally natural. The acting from the trio of leads is of course excellent but also from the unfamiliar supporting cast. The originality really hit with the contrast between the almost ""Carry On"" characters and the realisation of what they do and one of them has done. Not depicted flippantly, as in the typical crimeland flick, but with cold honesty.This dissonance between comical absurdity and moral darkness is shocking and disorientating. It is the main force in the story. It isn't a flash in the pan either, but is developed cunningly as the ethical maze of arguments, actions, intentions and jumbled consequences unfolds.Truly, this is a movie that is both comical and yet philosophically profound within the ambit of complete realism. Just one scene on its own poses a question most of us will never before have considered: can a mans moral debts be paid by the taking of his life without that being by his own hand? If that puzzles you, just watch the movie.Of course, no movie is perfect. One thing that slightly diminishes the freshness of the movie is that Fiennes character tends to remind one of that played by Ben Kingsley in ""Sexy Beast"". In fact, his manner of speech seems almost identical. Nonetheless, it works in context and, as with other aspects of the movie, produces both comedy and profundity. I think the appearance of movie extras echoing the visions of Bosch could have been bolder. One characters ultimate leap was the one thing a bit far-fetched, not because he would not have attempted it but in that it worked out as intended. On the other hand, the way the loose change used in that scene was ""primed"" in our thoughts earlier was maybe the best example of this technique I've ever noticed.I was staggered to discover that this was the directors first full piece.",In Bruges
256,Incendid,A dark comedy worth watching,7,29 June 2014,"Before i sat down to watch this movie i expected it to be okay, but i was quite wrong, In Bruges is a well constructed film, with great comedy, dark crime and good drama. Starting off with the story, i really like it when a movie tells the prologue throughout the movie giving you more clues and never telling you exactly what happened. The structure was fine and the whole movie was rushed or stretched, the writer managed to blend the action and drama together to create a film just right in length and tone. Onto characters, throughout the 1st and 2nd act of the movie we see the bond between our two main characters build and by the third we see them fallout and a situation follows, that i won't spoil. Onto directing, the scenes where we just got to look at Bruges was just perfect, every angle just matched up with the scene, i really felt the connection to the movie, In Bruges deserves praise for its efforts. It may not be the perfect movie but it certainly a movie worth watching. It receives an 8/10.",In Bruges
257,kasserine,Nice Blend Of Drama And Comedy,8,8 February 2008,"One of the problems with seeing a trailer for a film is it creates an expectation. If it raises expectations, and the film delivers, great. However, if the film is less then expected, then the viewer feels cheated. The best case scenario is the one I found myself in before I saw In Bruges. Low expectations.After seeing the trailer, In Bruges looked like a plodding British comedy with little originality and repetitious humor, hence the low expectations. Yet, In Bruges exceeded my minimal expectations, and, unlike my impression from the trailer, was an original drama with good acting and a nice blend of comedy mixed in. It was funny in the right places and appropriately dramatic when the story shifted into high gear towards the end.Set in, no surprise here, Bruges, Belgium, the plot focuses on two London hit men, Ray played by Colin Farrell, and Ken, played by Brendan Gleeson. The pair is sent to Belgium after Ray botches his first hi. And therein lies the humor, Ray has no interest in being in the medieval city, and Ken wants to sight see.I've never really liked Colin Farrell but who knew he had such a good sense of comedic timing? There is a running gag involving fighting with a bottle, and karate, that he manages to keep fresh as it pops up throughout the film. Brendan Gleeson's character provides the moral center and plays the straight man to Farrell's Ray. This works well as the movie turns more serious towards the end. However, for my money, the best performance is delivered by Ralph Fiennes who plays Harry the pair's criminal overlord back in London. Whereas Gleeson character embodies the moral center, Fiennes's Harry fills the role of principled immorality, if there is such a thing. Fiennes creates a character with a dubious moral center and is a quite believable figure of menace when he travels to Bruges to square off with Ken. Also, of note, is Jordan Prentice, an irritable dwarf who's in town to act in a movie filming there. His ramblings in one scene, about a coming race war, is worth the price of admission right there.The only aspect of the film that didn't work for me was Ray's love interest. Early in the film he manages to woo Chloe, a drug dealer with, drum roll please, a heart of gold. For my tastes, the budding romance seems a little forced and comes across more as a vehicle for jokes and drama. But it's a small thing and I doubt anyone but me would notice.I intentionally left a lot of plot points out, because, as I've mentioned, this film surprised me in a good way and I don't won't to ruin it for anyone else.In Bruges is a good film. Go see it.At the very least, it'll make you want to visit Bruges.",In Bruges
258,Guenniminator,One of the best movies for years,10,3 July 2013,"""In Bruges"" really is one of the best movies I've seen for years. It made me laugh, has some exciting, sad, nostalgic and magic moments. The city is awesome (I've been there twice) and is the best place to make a film like this. Colin Farrell, Ralph Fiennes and Brendan Gleeson were the best cast that had to be chosen for this film. You don't need explosions and computer effects to do an old fashioned masterpiece like this. This film contains everything you need to get entertained: bad language, very black sense of humor, well-Fed action sequences and a portrait of a magical place called Bruges. Cast & Crew did an amazing job!",In Bruges
259,lucasaq-1,Redemption and Regret,9,10 February 2008,"The trailer for this film would suggest fair like 2007's Shoot 'Em blood bath with a bit dark sense of humor. Instead, this film is totally different. No fast killing starts off this film, but a bit of profanity and a strangely tortured main character named Ray, who is supposedly a hit man. Things do not become crystal clear until about midway and then things take off crescendos to a slam-bang finish full of blood, but that is not what makes the film. What makes the film is its bitingly sharp sense of black humor where characters are mean to those around them trying to get away from their own problems. I never thought I would come away impressed by a Colin Farrell film, but this film made me immensely mirthful and laugh hard than I have for a while over this winter season of films. It is sad, but has a nice message packaged inside, which takes its time to get to the surface.",In Bruges

261,JoeC345,Great Movie,10,12 December 2010,"I know it's been awhile since this came out I actually still remember the first time I saw this. I was at my buddies house and we're doing a movie day we had already watched ""Funny Games"" and ""Diary of the Dead"" but I really didn't think when we put this in it would be as great as it was.Colin Farrell who I've been a fan of since ""Hart's War"" shows that he is a great actor in this movie. In the first maybe half of the movie it's a very dark comedic movie that I thoroughly enjoy but when it finally gets to the serious plot points it doesn't disappoint. Brendan Gleeson along with Colin Farrell make a great duo. With Gleeson's love of old buildings and tourism and Farrell's pouting and only wanting to go get drunk at the local pub.With all the quick side stories and adventures I won't waste my time trying to explain some of them and it would also decrease from the pleasure of finding out for yourself. Movies like this are rare nowadays it seems, a movie with slapstick comedy, bloody violence, and soul.Let's not forget Ralph Fiennes role, you almost want to say he went over the top but he doesn't it's almost pitch perfect for the role, I smiled whenever he was on screen, I've said before that previews are ruining movies lately by giving away to much plot but even if you think that's true with this one, trust me your wrong there is so much more to the movie then what's shown in the preview.So in conclusion I've tried to not give away any of the plot because this is one of the movies that you should know almost nothing about going in and let the movie take you for a enjoyable ride.

262,yourmotheratemydog715,One of the best movies so far this year.,9,7 July 2008,"Even if the ""life of a hit-man"" thing has been done many times before, ""In Bruges"" is a great movie, and miles above most of the crap being put out in theaters today.The story is about two hit men, Ray and Ken, who, after a hit that went wrong, are ordered to go to Bruges (it's in Belgium) and wait for their orders there. Ken goes around sightseeing, but Ray hates the place and wants to get out of there as soon as possible. Ray is still haunted by what happened at the last hit (I won't give away what happened, because it might be a spoiler) and is pretty depressed. But it all changes after Ken receives a phone call from his boss...As I said before, the ""life of a hit-man"" genre has been done many times. ""Pulp Fiction"", ""You Kill Me"", movies like that. I somewhat enjoyed ""You Kill Me"", but ""In Bruges"" is a definite step up.Ray and Ken are two interesting characters that are fleshed out well for the movie. They really are two good characters that you end up caring about by the end of the film.The dialog is great, and the black humor is very funny at parts. Some viewers might not ""get"" the humor, but they can just go back to watching recycled crap like ""First Sunday"" and ""Meet the Spartans"". I thought it was really funny.But the tone isn't always humorous, as soon the story turns even darker. The plot is interesting, and there's many unexpected twists along the way. It's a good balance between humor and drama, and the movie plays both perfectly.It's a shame movies like ""Fool's Gold"" get nationwide release and lots of publicity, but a gem like ""In Bruges"" gets forgotten. If you want a great comedy/drama, I definitely recommend ""In Bruges"", but if you want a full-on action-packed thriller, this really isn't what you're wanting.""In Bruges"" has an engrossing plot, great character development and is overall just a GOOD movie. It's out on DVD now, and I definitely recommend that you rent it, or even buy it! It truly is great, and I say: SEE IT.",In Bruges
263,afallguns,When in (f*ckin') Bruges,10,6 June 2015,"What a great movie... Flawless in anyway! Colin Farrell is in his best performance. It is natural, funny and kinda loose. It's brilliant! Brendan Gleeson was perfect supporting Colin's work, both in the deep-sad and the funny-nonsense times. Ralph Fiennes was also pretty good in the few minutes he was on screen... As I said, this movie is flawless. I'm not saying that it's the best movie ever made or anything, but it is one of few movies that you feel like what you see is exactly what the director wanted you to see. The sad dialogs, the dark humor, the politeness and rudeness. All of it felt like right! It might not please everyone, principally the Belgians from Bruges, for his black comedy and the constant (un)necessary swearing. The story is excellent, the cast worked brilliantly, the director had his great work of art. I feel the need to swear a little bit, in a homage to the movie. (I apologize to anyone who get upset about something in this review, both before and after this point.) This film is f*cking awesome, Colin F*ckin' Farrell is f*cking amazing in this sh*t, and you must see if you are from f*cking Bruges, wherever the f*ck Bruges is!",In Bruges
264,nyanbatcat,A Masterpiece,10,26 January 2018,"This movie achieves so much, but remains so focused, so easy to understand and streamlined, it amazes me again and again. I hardly re-watch any movies this is one of the few I do rewatch every other year. It has everything you could ask for: humour, love, thought, action and nice visuals.In Bruges takes the dust of the gangster-genre by putting in more of a connection to the viewer. We get to see shootouts, drugs and prostitutes, punches being thrown around, etc. yes, but what we also get are relateable character, which actions and motives are quite relateable. It has a quite enjoyable sense of humour that is never misplaced, which i imagine is very difficult in such a violent and emotional movie. The leadroles all do an amazing job and help a lot to understand what the characters are feeling.The love-story isnt that deep and rich, but absolutely makes sense in the movie. It is believable and you do want to see it flourish, so it absolutely serves its purpose in the plot.The location is amazing, the words ""fairytale town"" are used several times and that pretty much describes it pretty well. The way it is shot and the time of the year (christmas) add a romantic, but also cold and lonely touch to it (lonely because bruges is ""a shithole""). The fairy tale theme is woven not only into the visuals, but also some parts of the story can remind you of a fairy tale.Soundtrack is another aspect I love about this movie, just like the plot, the location and the character Ray, it adds to the feeling of this sad, yet beautiful tale.To top it off, we get some stuff to ponder over. Atonement is a big deal here. Where is the line between good and evil, what should you do if you did something horrible and so on. All this is blended together so well, that it has been one of my favorite movies for about 7 years now and Im planning on watching it again some time.",In Bruges
265,Mrswing,Hell isn't Bruges... It's this excrement of a movie (SPOILERS),1,23 July 2008,"In Bruges is so relentlessly, mind-bogglingly bad, it's a miracle anyone was stupid enough to put up money for this piece of crap. Not only does it take forever to get going, is it full of people doing completely unbelievable things, does it completely fail to capture the spirit of Bruges and its inhabitants (and believe me, there's plenty material there which can be parodied mercilessly if one is so inclined), but worst of all it doesn't even know what it wants to say. And it's pretentious, to boot. The romance is ridiculous, the midget/dwarf character is only there to function as the punchline of a sick joke-oid (which really isn't funny or profound or thought-provoking). None of the secondary characters are believable (a pregnant woman ordering an armed gangster out of her hotel - without showing the slightest worry or fear, for instance, or someone piloting a boat down the canals of Bruges who doesn't react when someone leaps onto his boat from a hotel window and bullets start flying), they're badly written and acted, and except for the ticket seller none of them are Flemish (let alone from Bruges). They're mainly French speakers - why, for Christ's sake? There are hundreds of Flemish actors and a few dozen of them are actually quite good. Script-wise, the problem is that the jokey tone of many of the scenes completely clashes with the extreme tragedy of what Colin Farrell's character has done. And once this horror is revealed (which makes it very hard to empathize with him at first), absurd crime situations and 'cool' bits of ultra-violence just don't fit with the overall tone. This should be a story of either reprisal or redemption, but it ends up being neither and both. As the film progresses, it becomes more and more ludicrous, with the scene in the hotel between Farrell, Fiennes and the landlady as the absolute nadir. There's also some quite shocking gore (a boy with his brains blown out, a character with half his face blown off)On the plus side, Farrell (whom I really, really hate, normally) is extremely good, Brendan Gleeson also does a good job, and Ralph Fiennes does his best with a very ill-conceived role. And some of Farrell's rants and jokes are amusing. But the weaknesses of the script and the weak acting of the rest of the cast make this an unalloyed disaster. Too bad McDonagh didn't jump off the Belfort instead of Gleeson's character. Then the world would have been spared this travesty of a film.",In Bruges
266,garydiamond,The saving grace of the year it was released.,8,17 March 2009,"Personally, I found 2008 to be a very underwhelming year for film-making. Three of my favourite directors came up short (Chris Nolan with The Dark Knight, the Coens with Burn After Reading and Guy Ritchie with RockNRolla) and a lot of the currently popular 'superhero' pictures just weren't cutting it. Every new movie I saw seemed to be lacking in witty scripting, and most had disappointing endings.Fortunately, somebody recommended I watch In Bruges. And what a bloody good decision that turned out to be.This film has attracted a lot of flak. It seems to polarise critics. People who look on the surface just see a couple of hit-man types who swear all the time and are throughly unpleasant individuals, not at all likable. These critics perhaps missed two of the most important aspects of the picture: it's a dark, black comedy in the vein of American Psycho, and it is incredibly subtle in places. So subtle that it really needs a couple of viewings to appreciate the minimalistic approach of the scriptwriting and direction.What I like most about the experience - and it really is an experience - is the deliberately grey morality demonstrated by everyone in the film. How nice people can be rude and indecent, and how those supposed to be evil can actually be incredibly tender and caring even if they might be confused about expressing it. Colin Farrell finally comes into his own here, demonstrating an incredible emotional range. He goes from childlike impatience to arrogant and presumptuous to heartbroken and desolate. It would be a tough job for any lead, but I was with him all the way. Veteran actor Brendan Gleeson has some formidable chops to add as well, with the camaraderie and gradual friendship/mentorship he gives to Ray being one of the focal points and a definite highlight. Everyone in this makes their screen time count, whether it's minutes or mere seconds.It's an odd story, not completely original but certainly off-kilter. The swearing is necessary, as it is in Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. That Martin McDonagh both writes and directs allows him to flesh out his script with more emotion, because as mentioned it's quite minimal and all the better for it. It relies on strong delivery and use of body language and facial expression. I honestly think you have to see it three or four times to truly appreciate the effect.Bruges is captured beautifully on film. Without drawing too much attention to the backdrop, it is clear that the location is an intriguing juxtaposition to the moral dilemmas faced by our two protagonists. It speaks volumes about the young gun, Ray, that he finds nothing comforting or calming in the serenity of his hiding place. Ken, the wise and weary companion, finds peace of mind and a moral clarity it is obvious he had ignored for years.If you can get your head around the violence (it's used sparingly but is, I felt, genuinely shocking and horrific) and the strong, blunt language, you might find not just the best picture of 2008 by some distance, but also the sort of drama you want to revisit time and again.If you haven't yet, go and watch In Bruges. It's fine work to be sure, to be sure.",In Bruges
267,Spinetinglers,"""Maybe that's what hell is, an entire eternity spent In Bruges.""",10,25 March 2008,"After a contract killing goes disastrously wrong, two hit men are told by their boss, the foul-mouthed Harry, to hide out in Bruges. So they head for Bruges, even though they have no idea why they have been sent there, or even where Bruges is. It's in Belgium. In Bruges, the two hit men are forced to come to terms with their own inner demons, and they are doomed to face the consequences of their actions.It is easy to spot that Martin McDonagh, the writer and director of In Bruges, is heavily influenced by Quentin Tarantino. In fact, I would go so far as to say that this is the type of movie Tarantino would have made, had he been born in Dublin and not Knoxville, Tennessee. Every Tarantino trademark, from the Mexican standoff to the retrospective storytelling, is brilliantly executed in this film. In addition, the use of piquant and pervading dialogue to build McDonagh's characters and drive the narrative is also superbly executed. Tarantino would be proud. However, this film is not just another Quentin Tarantino knockoff by a British director. Apart from the obvious nods to Tarantino, there are other elements that make this an interesting and distinctly entertaining film. The film is shot on location in Bruges, a small, picturesque town in Belgium, of which most people probably have never heard. Bruges is portrayed as a town steeped in history and religious lore. And, despite Farrell's character, Ray, saying it is a ""s******e"" at every possible opportunity, Bruges looks quite exquisite on the big screen. If it is to be the last place you see before you die, it is definitely a beautiful place to go.Another key ingredient of this exemplary film is the tour de force performances by the three leads and supporting cast. Colin Farrell, in my opinion, has never really lived up to his early promise. Farrell has had more misses than hits, but his performance in In Bruges shows that he has impeccable comic timing and can also deliver a performance that is, at the same time, both subtle and poignant. Gleason is superb, as usual, as the older and wiser hit-man, who cannot bring himself to punish Farrell's character for his gruesome mistake. And, finally, Ralph Fiennes drops the repressed upper-class-Englishman guise that he usually adopts and plays the frenetic, foul-mouthed gangster with gusto.In Bruges does get very dark at times, for a film that is billed as a comedy; thus, some viewers will be put off. But, I believe its propensity to shock you one minute and make you laugh the next is one of the film's strongest qualities. Although the writer-director was born in London, it is obvious that there are many strong Irish influences in his life. And, these Irish influences are very evident in his writing.In Bruges, is a darkly comic film, with lashings of Catholic guilt throughout. Its strength lies in its outstanding characterisations and its ultra-sharp dialogue. In Bruges is an example of screen writing at its finest and the film is destined to become a classic. Even better still, it is a first-rate advertisement for the city of Bruges. And, after watching the film, I know I want to go there!",In Bruges
268,gsic_batou,Little Gem,8,1 November 2008,"I must start this review by stating that even tough I love the big, epic, genre-defining, multi-million dollar, all time and all new classics, my greatest pleasure in cinema is to stumble upon the little movie. Not little on budget(even if it happens to be true many times), but a movie that is restrained in scale, that has but a few characters and a simple premise; a movie that expects nothing of itself but to be what it is. In one word: SIMPLICITY!If you read Tolstoy, you soon realize that in his writing the biggest remarks on human nature are expressed in the most beautifully simplified verse. It holds true to all arts that, through simplicity and showing nothing more than a detail, you get a more accurate display of life.""In Bruges"" is such a gem. Perfect as it is. Shot in the beautiful city of Bruges, to which we are introduced by some of the most beautiful(and some times hilarious) footage I have ever seen-one where a dog looks from the window to the street like an old lady burns into the memory fast. The acting, as it always happens in such small movies, is what carries the film. Great acting all around with the grand prize going to Colin Farell who seems to be on top form after giving up alcohol. A very nuanced performance from a truly great actor.Overall, this is the most enjoyment I have taken from cinema this year. Fun, layered, meaningful and a treat to the eyes.8/10",In Bruges
269,jd-116,Fifth rate rip-off of Pulp Fiction,2,5 August 2011,"In Pulp Fiction, the dialogue was, if not witty exactly, at least funny from time to time. And you empathise to an extent with Jules and whateverisnamewas, especially after the scene where they are cleaning up the car. That's really quite funny.There's nothing equivalent in ""In Bruges"", (and they can't even spell or call it right, the city is really named Brugge as everybody knows) and I don't understand the point at all. WTF is all that stuff with the midget all about? And why is it to be assumed that just because a guy uses the c-word every third time he opens his mouth that that makes him well hard? (Sexy Beast, another totally crap film, makes the same mistake). The fairies at the bottom of my garden are harder than Harry is.As a gangster film it's ludicrous. (Has there been a decent gangster film since Lee Marvin died?)

270,s_iliya_p,Let's go to Bruges!,9,31 March 2019,"As Roger Ebert has put fantastically, if this movie doesn't affect you in anyway, it will urge you to visit Belgium and its Bruges!
I love how this movie now seems like an offensive film on many levels. The terms said and things shown in this movie can be very politically incorrect.
What I liked about the movie is that even the unnecessary scenes in this movie are delightful. The story itself is very clever and the way it's told is clever as well. The morality involved in this movie is quite challenging and influencing. Even the lowest of the low have standards in their ethics. This can be seen in many significant moments of the movie.
I loved the brutally real comedy in the movie. it's not that it is meant to be a comedy, but it is funny. Just how life itself is. Loyalty is the other great element in this movie and somehow I feel is the same as the standards.
The most important elements in the movie, I think, are survival instincts and self-image. After watching this movie, you'll have some questions about life. And this is how powerful the movie is. acting is adequately good, and the music is just fit for such landscapes.",In Bruges
271,JackBenjamin,Moral Code,8,23 March 2009,"I think playwrights tend to keep their theater chops even when trying to write something cinematic. Usually I dislike the effect -- a static camera and a single setting -- but for a film about two souls stuck in purgatory it works well.All three central characters are immersed in a morality not totally alien to convention, but just slightly askew (which McDonagh matches nicely by creating a world that's slightly askew too). Ray, Ken, and Harry all acknowledge that the death of the child was wrong, but the question preoccupying the film is how to atone for the sin -- Ray and Harry are Old Testament, eye for an eye guys; Ken is a New Testament scion, he believes in penance and potential for renewal.Harry and Chloe are the gods of the story. Chloe in that she sells drugs to the film stars and then to the real stars, her influence permeating both worlds, providing the bridge between the two. Harry is the disembodied voice commanding and directing until Ken defies him and he takes corporeal form in the third act. It's a n episodic film, mainly in respect to Harry's plot line, which reinforces the fact that these souls are on a journey.The miniature (pun intended) film within the film is a great self-referential touch -- Tom DiCillo would be especially proud. In the end, the main players are appropriated by that film and the two worlds merge.The dialogue is melismatic and spicy and perfectly delivered by three top-notch performers.",In Bruges
272,colinbarnard-1,Atonement and Existentialism In Bruges,8,10 February 2008,"A European film through and through, showing its deep theatrical roots, ""In Bruges"" works on may levels, and is a fine night at the cinema.The film follows the denouement of a ""job"" gone bad for two Irish hit men, who are forced to hole up in Bruges, Belgium, and really can't stand the inactivity. The forced waiting, a symbolic purgatory in both assassins' struggle for absolution, gives Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell a chance to act through some marvelous comic dialogue.The film itself looks like it was filmed in an area of the old city of Bruges that is no more than a 500 square metre radius. It doesn't matter, because the film is a character study more than anything, and like all good theatre, the character interplay allows the audience to forget the confined spaces.Ralph Fiennes comes into the film late basically stealing Ben Kingsley's character from ""Sexy Beast"". This has to be an absolutely deliberate choice, so can't really be criticized. The writing is so good that Fiennes can have real fun with it. All the actors do, as a matter of fact.I have been deeply suspicious of Colin Farrell's ability to read a script in the past. His choices of projects in the past has been spotty. Not this time: his acting ability is brought to the fore by director and screenwriter Martin McDonagh. Farrell gives a very strong performance as a morally challenged hit-man.Brendan Gleeson has been around forever, and is a renowned character actor. You may remember him from ""Braveheart"" as Hamish Campbell, Mel Gibson's loyal adjutant. He is able to completely bury himself in this part. Colin Farrell has the capacity to reach these heights as well, and in fact, in this film, shows many of the mannerisms and intensity of Russell Crowe (whom I consider to be the best actor on the planet).I appreciated the comedy and satire working hand in hand with the moral complexity of the characters' inner struggles. It makes for a very satisfying film, one that is much more than entertainment. When you consider what the budget was in comparison to many Hollywood films, ""In Bruges"" serves as a reminder that it is the script and the quality of the direction that makes a film. Why Hollywood thinks they can just throw money into a project and expect people to come to the cinema is beyond me.",In Bruges
273,ni6hant,English knows comedy so better than the Americans,9,22 January 2020,After watching few English movies I am now convinced the comedy is just at another level in English compared to Americans.The movie is amazing. I laughed so much.,In Bruges
274,Syxiepoo,Perfect,10,7 January 2015,"I just watched In Bruges again after a gap of maybe two years. It gets better every time I see it as I always see something new in the story, the acting ... everything.Brendan Gleeson, in particular, is a consummate actor and, in my humble opinion, deserved to have won every award he has ever been nominated for. This was certainly an Oscar-worthy performance from Brendan, and close to that from the other key actors too.Yes, it's violent and visceral and there's a lot of swearing, but it's the language we might expect from characters like these. Not for the kids or the faint-hearted then, but everyone else should go see this masterclass in jet black comedy.",In Bruges
275,MovieSoup,"Hilarious, great plot and great performances all round",9,29 September 2017,"In Bruges is a great comedy film that is peppered with true emotional scenes and great one-liners. I really enjoyed watching this film as it gave me a real laugh and also really made me emotionally invest in all the characters especially Ray and Ken. The way this film made me feel is very much down to the writing which is all the work of Martin McDonagh. It is a shame he doesn't do more films as he knows how to write a great script. I implore you to watch this and then watch Seven Psychopaths as they are both masterclasses on how to write an engaging plot with great character development.The plot then centres around two assassins, Ray and Ken, who go to Bruges after a hit goes wrong. There they take in the sights and await further instructions. All hell breaks when Ken is asked to kill Ray. I will not ruin anything else for you dear reader I will just say that things develop quite well and the pacing is solid. Some of the best scenes in this film are just of Ray and Ken talking to each other and the banter they have. Colin Farrell is excellent in this film and plays Ray really well. There are scenes where he goes from joking with Ken straight into crying about bad things he has done. These scenes show off the talent he has as an actor and really gets you invested in Ray and the tortured soul he is. I always say a mark of a good actor is if he can cry convincingly and Farrell does this really well. Another great performance is Brenden Gleeson who plays Ken really well. His character is as tortured as Ray and it really shows in the performance Gleeson gives. He is more the serious type in this film whereas Ray definitely is the comic relief. That is not to say he has no funny lines, everyone in this film does, but you can tell he is the straight man. Ralph Finnes as Harry is brilliant and his character, being the main antagonist, moves the plot a long at a reasonable pace. He has great lines like the first scene he is in the ""you're an inanimate fu**ing object!!"" scene which is to me one of the funniest and best put downs i've seen in a film. It's is delivered so well be Finnes that the scene really gets you invested in his character from the start and you realise that he is a well-meaning bad guy. The actual cinematography of the film is great and gives you a real sense of Bruges as a place and setting. In fact the way it is shot gives the impression that Bruges is not just a place but an actual character in the movies as well. It gives a tone of old European cities so well in fact that I might have a holiday there in the future. In a time when most Hollywood films have a boring tone it is refreshing to see good tone and cinematography. The music in this film is not very prevalent but it really doesn't have to be. What makes this film good is the dialog and look of the film, not the music which is only in the background and not at all the main focus of any scene in the film. The music is only there to enhance certain scenes and that is all we need it to do. The jokes are fu*king hilarious and clever in this film, honestly there are scenes in this film that had me crying with laughter. The American tourist joke with the stairs is genius and a great bit of social commentary on fat annoying American tourists and their stereotypical mannerisms whilst abroad. The best thing is that while these funny scenes and jokes are very entertaining they do not distract from any characters development. The jokes enhance the characters, for example Ray is a funny character with some great comedic lines but it doesn't take away from the fact that he has done wrong in his life and you as the audience feel his repentance at all the bad things he has done. This film is just brilliant and well worth a watch it goes without saying. However the main thing that I found a problem with, and it is a little problem, is the lack of effort the supporting cast gives. The midget was not a very well rounded character and Chloe was not very inspiring as the ""lead female"" character. In fact the pregnant woman who owns the hotel was better, acting wise, than her.I think this film is brilliant with a great cast, for the most part, and a great story that is told in a clearly presented way. The plot and characters make it so much more emotional that it becomes more than a comedy film. I can't say enough good words about the script and I really do look forward to 2018s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri which is the next film Martin McDonagh has written. I would advise you to watch any film he has done as you will be entertained.",In Bruges

Turned out there was more to it than just that.The movie's style of comedy suits me, so it was a pleasant first half with these in-character performances. As the movie gets darker, the actors still successfully pull it off. Colin Farrell's emotions look genuine.Principle wise, the movie deals with racism and racial prejudices (lightheartedly), as well as a certain criminal code and their willingness to stick to it. The major theme, however, is atonement, and is dealt with quite well.An interesting watch, with a good plot and some real emotions",In Bruges
278,dracher,"Brilliant writing, a work that comes within an inch of true greatness.",8,24 January 2009,"This film walks in its own way, and with the exception of one or two alcoves or nooks and crannies, it walks along new roads and byways.I wanted so strongly to give this picture 10 out of 10, but it was spoiled by two very silly and deeply regrettable scenes. I say regrettable, because they were so foolishly overlooked, and so easily fixable, that I can never imagine why they were allowed to remain in the finished product. One could have been omitted altogether, the other re shot very simply. The first is the lunatic scene with the so called overweight American tourists, this was like a bad moment in Screwballs or Dumb and Dumber, and should never have happened at all, given that it did happen, it would not have harmed the story in any way to have committed it to the canvas bag or to the cutting room floor. The second regrettable scene was in the restaurant, when, for some reason best known to the director, the direction takes on an amateur theatrical or painting by numbers technique. She exits to go to the ladies room, he blows smoke and an arrogant diner complains, he snaps it and calls the diner by inviting him to repeat his complaint, this leads to an over injection of testosterone on both sides, they stand, punches are thrown, and the hero decks the diner, his date then swings a bottle and he decks her, the table breaks away, as many a card table did in the old westerns, and both decked characters remain decked, she returns from ladies room (right on cue)just in time to clock the situation; to this point, nobody has stopped eating, the waiters are all out the back having a smoke, and the restaurant manager has gone for a Pee, or is taking a shower in the next building, because nobody attempts to stop the fight, or even pay it the slightest attention. In order to avoid any further collapse in the suspension of disbelief, the director cuts to ""exterior night two"" and the couple out in the street walking away from the restaurant. The time that would have been saved by cutting the Fat Tourist scene, could well have been used to support the utterly unbelievable restaurant scene.Such a shame, because the film is a beauty, and the combined efforts of all concerned in this production, have provided the world with a work of nearly true greatness.Regards, Dracher",In Bruges
279,majormadmax,Absolutely Fantastic!,10,20 January 2010,"There are many great reviews of this film, and all are justified. What drew our interest to it was we used to live in Belgium, and have been to Brugge (Flemish spelling) on several occasions. It is truly a beautiful town, and that is what makes this such a great movie, as it is the perfect backdrop for the plot. The acting is absolutely brilliant (kudos to Colin Farrell, most likely his best performance ever), the script well written and overall it is just what a movie should be, a balanced combination of humor, action and drama! This is far from a brainless action flick, this movie draws the viewer in and holds their attention the entire time.

Sadly, although it is not without charm, I found it to be slow and dry more often than not. It seemed as if the film was searching for an identity that it never really found, was it a comedy, drama, gangster picture, or what? I was was never sure. The scenery is interesting and of course plays a role in the film. I did enjoy some of the comic dialogue and moments in the story, but in the end it did not make it a worthwhile trip to the theater. I would have been happier seeing it on cable and not spending $7.00. My suggestion, wait until you can see it on cable and save your money.",In Bruges
281,guy_anisimov,Hmm...,9,26 December 2008,"...a few of months back, when my uncle returned home from one of his many business trips, a DVD copy of 'In Bruges' returned with him. Being a fool, i ended up judging the film by it's cover and deciding not to dedicate precious time to viewing it. A combination of incidents including the Christmas holidays and having nothing better to do, resulted in me giving the ""shithole"" of Bruges a try.What i found is quite hard to describe. Comedy? perhaps, i hope i'm not too rude to say that this film was too good to be categorized as a comedy. Drama? that might be it, but then again...no. Anyways, the film takes place in Bruges. ""Where the **** is Bruges? It's in Belgium."" Two hit-man are sent there after completing a mission, and are being asked to wait for further instructions.Beautiful, Beautiful cinematography of Christmas time in a small town known mostly for it's well preserved medieval and Gothic character. A most captivating Original Soundtrack composed by Carter Burwell. Brilliant script writing, including a great, great dialogue as well as a impressive direction debut, both by Martin McDonagh. Adding to that a cast led by Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes along with magnificent smaller roles by more unpopular faces portraying a dwarf, a female lover, a Russian gun supplier, an historical tower manager and a local policeman. And there you have your Must-See!I'll end by referring to what turned this film from just being good to being great, to me at least, and this is the ending. In my eyes, the ending is a homage, or perhaps a pastiche to a painting of Hell and Judgment Day we are acquainted with in a museum along the film. This ending, these images, they will stay with you well after the credits are gone. It takes a little something for a film to make me watch it twice.

283,ardentayu,Funny & Quirky  good suspense in the end!,9,13 February 2008,"I loved this movie. I saw it at Sundance. Probably best classified as a dark comedy, IN BRUGES has a mix of comedy, drama, and action. There are a few violent scenes. Great job by writer/director Martin McDonagh.The movie made me laugh from the opening note: Colin Farrell's voice over during the opening credits asking ""Where the fook is Bruges?"" The movie follows two hit men stuck in Bruges awaiting the next order from their boss. Farrell is dealing with some of his own personal demons. Much of the first half of the movie is talking heads, but due to the clever writing and comedic moments (often cynical and not-PC), the movie never gets stale. Both lead actors  Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson  are the superb and they make the perfect odd couple. It is nice to see Colin Farrell playing a role other than the cool, slick guy. Farrell's character verges on whiney, but that is part of what makes him endearing. Ralph Fiennes add a bad guy to the mix of eclectic characters.",In Bruges

This suited him very well. Mr Gleason was as always excellent and me and my gf got to sympathize with both these characters. As this is an European movie we knew something would happen and it wouldn't have a happy ending where you get saluted in the end, but this makes the movie all the more real.It has brilliant humor and i hope the Americans can take it, (seen a few on here who cant tho) as its not how Europeans see them, its just the huge generalization that goes on about Americans as there are generalizations about ppl from any country. Its not much to cry about i feel. Every time i see something being said about Sweden or Swedish ppl in movies good or bad i just think its rather funny. The profanity and blood, yes its some of that, but if you cant take that you should stick to watching Lindsay Lohan or Matthew Mccouaughey movies.Many has made Tarrantino parallels to this movie and to be honest it didn't strike me at all when i watched the movie,sure Tarrantino has made good dialouges in certain movies but these days he seems to squeeze in so much talking that its just chit chat. You can easily go to the bathroom when nature calls or get snacks during his dialouges without missing anything and in this movie you simply cant.Loved this one from the start to the end. At times it was super funny, espc that time in the park when Gleason was gonna finish of Farrell at the same time it was intriguing and full of excitement.I truly hope this movie gets its recognition, cause it deserves that. And in all seriousness, this is a film, one shouldn't take so seriously on the jokes that might offend but laugh at it instead.

289,grandenchilada,Highly overrated,6,10 February 2008,"Given the track record of Martin McDonagh as an incredibly gifted playwright, I expected In Bruges to be smarter and funnier, particularly smarter. McDonagh does have a way with words, but it seems to have eluded him in this film, which works better as a concept. Maybe it would work better as a play, but as a film it feels half-baked. I see that he is referencing Waiting for Godot and he's playing with his usual mashup of violence and humor, and he is paying homage to old, masterful movies like Touch of Evil and Vertigo, but the whole thing feels really forced and rather soulless. I am willing to suspend my disbelief and swallow that the wonderful Brendan Gleeson and the incredibly uneven Colin Farrell are hit men on holiday, but why? They really seem to be the nicest chaps, with no edge of meanness. Lovable thugs who work for a fastidious thug, played rather maniacally, by Ralph Fiennes, whose performance over the phone is actually funnier than when he actually shows up. It is nice to see him in a comic role and sporting a perfect thuggish accent, but he is not believable either. And the actors are saddled with stupid lines, which is really surprising coming from Mr. McDonagh. Gleeson is divine as a hit-man perfectly content to spend some downtime sightseeing. He revels in the calm. I love Brendan Gleeson and if there is a reason to see this movie, he is it. Farrell is all over the place, and trying really hard to be funny, which may not be entirely his fault. He is best when he feels guilty and dissolves into tears, but otherwise he mugs for the camera like there is no tomorrow. Jeremie Renier, who has starred in the distinguished films of the Dardenne brothers, L'Infant and La Promesse, has a bit part here. This always bothers me, that when the big foreign production comes to town, the best actors in that country end up playing stupid bit parts. Such is the pecking order. There is a subplot involving a racist dwarf, and fat Americans, so you know the movie is aiming low. Some American critics have vociferously objected to the violence, which is really beyond me, considering Hollywood is still churning out violent porn like Rambo. The violence is over the top in concept, as Farrell kills human beings that are taboo to kill. And this may be the point of the movie, that the principles of criminals are bogus, and killing anybody is wrong, period. But it's a point we expected Martin McDonagh to make with his accustomed panache, not all dumbed down.",In Bruges
290,johnpetersca,What Martin McDonagh's All About,8,5 April 2008,"The three main characters in this film speak in torrents of obscenities, well known words for sexual intercourse and contempt and female genitalia and contempt. In real life, I think badly of people who talk this way and try to stay away from them. In the movie that Martin McDonagh wrote and directed, however, the repetitious obscenities take on an almost magical quality as they reveal layers within the characters who speak them. The effect is like that in some of Michael McClure's poems in which common words are continually repeated. The result is not to build metaphors or similes but to develop weight by simple presence.At first, the beautiful old Belgian city of Bruges seems an entirely wrong place for the two Irish gangsters who are sent to it after one of them botches the killing of a priest by shooting and killing a child as well. Ken and Ray, both hired killers, are sent by Harry, their gangster boss. Harry has pleasant childhood memories of Burges and his subordinates speculate that he thinks it's a good place for them to cool out. Ken, an experienced assassin, likes Bruges and is ready to be a serious European tourist. Ray, young and petulant, can't say ""Bruges"" without a preliminary obscenity and says he hates being there.As the men tour the city's well-preserved medieval structures, they visit the Groeninge Museum and view two paintings that capture even Ray's attention. One is Hieronymus Bosch's Last Judgment with its many images of torment. The lower portion of the middle panel of the triptych is what is shown in the film, representing Judgment Day. It is full of nude human figures, many of them pierced by swords and arrows. A large knife emerges from a plant held by an ape in the panel's lower right-hand corner. The other, more realistic, painting is of the Judgment of Cambyses by Gerard David. It is a portion of an 15th century Netherlandish diptych that depicts Sisammes, an ancient Greek judge mentioned by Herodotus, being flayed alive as punishment for allowing money to influence his judgments. Several men are cutting Sisammes's skin from his body. His teeth are clenched but he is not screaming. His torturers calmly go about their business and are viewed indifferently by a group of well-outfitted aristocrats.The paintings are more than background to the film's action; they are physical representations of the turmoil within Ken's and Ray's souls, similar to the torments in Dante's Inferno. Ultimately, McDonagh is a Catholic moralist, though it is easy to miss this aspect of his work as it is so often overshadowed by his eccentric mixture of cleverness and repulsive violence.Ken continues to visit old buildings and museums and Ray has adventures appropriate to his station in criminal life. He exchanges insults with a dwarf, arranges a liaison with a beautiful local woman drug dealer, and blinds a Russian in one eye with a blank bullet. Then Ken gets a call from Harry ordering him to kill Ray. It seems that Harry doesn't approve of Ray's having murdered a kid. Ken doesn't like it but he's a company man who follows his boss's orders. When he approaches Ray from the back with a drawn gun, he sees that Ray's about to shoot himself. Ken can't help himself from stopping Ray. He calls Harry. Harry cusses him out and takes a train to Burges. Thus begins a bloodbath that's probably the least interesting part of the film. Except for Ray, all of the major characters and some secondary ones end up dead, as in Hamlet on steroids.The extreme violence of McDonagh's film has consequences, like the violence in Before the Devil Knows You're Dead and unlike the violence in The Departed. Still, the unreality of much of it and the total absence of any law enforcement response take suspension of disbelief further than many viewers may be willing to go. And the film has a stagy quality, both in the way in which characters appear at just the right moment for a bloody denouement and in McDonagh's inability to abandon the proscenium arch. Fundamentally though, I don't always like McDonagh's work but I can't deny its power.",In Bruges

It is a masterpiece of black comedy. I loved it so much I watched it twice in seven days and could watch it again and again and still laugh.It is one of those films where, as they say, the chemistry is perfect. Gleeson's performance is stupendous. A large brooding man with a soft interior acts as the perfect foil for Farrel's almost manic character. The script is superbly crafted and the timing of these two actors would put many a stand up comedian to shame.I admire the director for selecting Bruges for the backdrop. How many more 'cockney gangsta' films must we see that are shot in London? He has broken the mould.I have to admit I have no liking for Ralph Fiennes. How could anybody like a pratt that insists on being called Rafe and not Ralph? Conceit or what? Having said that his character performance is brilliant. It goes from parody to menacing and his face and accent for the role fit the bill perfectly.I think it's going to be a long long time before I see another film of this calibre.I would shower this film with awards and it is to be hoped the Director/Writer gets busy with some more high class entertainment.Excellent!",In Bruges

In Bruges stars Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farell as two hit men Ray and Ken, being told to hideout in Bruges and await further instructions from their boss Harry, played by Ralph Fiennes, in London. The film has all of Martin McDonagh's traits and style, e.g Lots of cursing, lots of blood and violence and lots of black comedy. His style isn't for everyone and his comedy is defiantly not for everyone, however if he is for you you'll think he's the best in the world. But, aside from whether he's your cup of tea or not, you have to appreciate the storyline, the acting and most defiantly the script. In Bruges is one of the best films to release in the last few years and defiantly 2008. It is an undeniable little gem that I'm sure people have missed. But since I've seen it, I've been hooked on what he's done previously and what he will do in the future. He's a brilliant writer and a great director and you can tell he works well with the actors as Colin Farell was brilliant in it.Great film. 8/10",In Bruges
298,Robert_90,One of the best films of the year,9,4 September 2008,"I like to think of movies like In Bruges as genuine gems. When I say ""movies like In Bruges"", I necessarily think of films with similar subject matter. I tend to think of those kind of films which justappear. Out of nowhere, you hear about a movie. The promotional material looks rather impressive. The film looks like it belongs to a genre you're interested in. You allow yourself a glimpse of the basic plot (no more, lest the experience is spoilt) and it sounds like something that, in the right hands, could be inflated into a compelling piece of cinema. In Bruges is a tick in each of those boxes. As of writing, I'd definitely consider it one of the best films I've seen all year, if not the best outright.""What makes you say that?"" you may ask. I guess the simple answer is this  everything. Yes, I know, very simple  but everything in this movie just falls right into place and the result is a finely polished caper flick. If I had to pinpoint the film's strongest individual part, I'd say it was the script. Writer-director McDonagh is also a renowned playwright, and the same quality translates to the film's story. In Bruges has a very play-like feel to it, largely due to its heavy reliance on character development. As the two leads, Gleeson and Farrell are nothing short of brilliant. They are capable of taking several different ""duo"" clichés and twisting them into something that feels surprisingly fresh, and even when they're not paired together, they maintain strong presences on-screen. Gleeson is perfect as the amiable Ken, but Farrell truly shines as Ray, who balances cockiness with insecurity deftly. Even though I haven't seen much of Farrell's other work, I honestly think he turned in a potential career-best act here.The supporting cast is also treated very well. Even the smallest supporting characters are a source of great comedy or great drama, whatever may be needed. Whenever they reappear in the story, it never feels forced but fits in perfectly. Out of all of them, Jordan Prentice steals the show as an embittered American dwarf who's in Bruges to make an art-house film. The only real weakness I could find with the cast was Clémence Poésy as drug-dealer/love interest Chlöe, who isn't necessarily bad, but isn't really given anything spectacular to work with.The film rolls along at a great pace. There is the very occasional scene that doesn't feel like it goes anywhere, but the rest of it manages to be great. The balance between comedy (largely as a result of Ray's none-too-pleasant altercations with locals and non-locals alike) and drama is excellent. The film has countless laugh-out-loud moments, yet it also has some genuinely shocking twists in it. It manages to remain compelling all throughout its running time. Another aspect I feel really gives the film a distinct feel is the location of Bruges itself. You've got to love those films where the location virtually becomes a character in the story, and Bruges (memorably described by Ralph Fiennes's Harry as a ""beautiful f***ing fairy tale town"") certainly comes into its own as such a ""character"". The locales are brilliant, none so much as the Bell Tower, which is easily the most memorable building featured in the film.To conclude, I loved In Bruges. Plain and simple. It's a hundred-odd minutes worth of entertainment, both comedic and tragic. What few flaws this film has are made up for by its many strengths. It may be a little strong in the violence/language department, but if that doesn't bother you, you should enjoy this, easily one of the best films I've watched in a while.",In Bruges
299,derekdiercksmeier,This Film Is Brilliant!!!,10,10 October 2012,"""In Bruges"" is a brilliant film. Colin Farrell delivers an outstanding performance as Ray, a rookie hit-man who is ordered to execute a priest, but inadvertently kills a young boy in the process. Brendan Gleeson plays an expert hit-man named Ken, who is ordered to take Ray to Bruges and hide out until their boss, played by Ralph Fiennes, contacts them. Ken loves Bruges, but Ray hates being there and constantly complains about the city: ""If I'd grown up on a farm and was retarded, Bruges might impress me. But I didn't, so it doesn't."" This film is hilarious. The script, written by the brilliant Martin McDonagh, is dark, mature, brilliant, witty, shocking, and endlessly entertaining. Martin McDonagh directs the film with an enormous amount of passion and feeling. Colin Farrell delivers the performance of his career in ""In Bruges"". The film's cinematography is beautiful and perfectly captures the city in all of it's living glory. ""In Bruges is of the best films I have ever seen.",In Bruges

303,teresaband,Hilarious and dark,9,24 April 2008,"Crikey there's a lot of swearing this movie. Not that it's a bad thing, but you do wonder how it'll go down in the states where people are a little less familiar with the word ""c**t"" being used like punctuation.If you're not a sensitive soul who abhors such sweary behavior you'll love this though, because it's fantastic. The trailers would have you believe it's a madcap jape, when in reality it's dark as hell but shot through with a brilliantly judged jet-black humor that makes it a pretty unique watch. It's not often a film this sombre will have you rolling in the aisles, and it's a tricky thing to do right, but ""In Bruges"" nails it seemingly effortlessly.It also looks beautiful, what with the location being pretty damn gorgeous and Colin Farrell (despite popular opinion) is a great actor when he's given a decent script to flex his muscles with. If there's any justice people will cotton on to this and forget ""SWAT"" ever existed.It only starts to dip ever so slightly with the appearance of Ralph Fiennes, but that's just because you're having such a good time watching Colin Farrell drink, snort and insult his way around Bruges that you almost forget there's a plot, so when it appears it feels almost intrusive.That feeling doesn't last long though, such is the film's deft balancing of tone, meaning that even once the laughs give way to the more serious stuff, you're invested sufficiently in the characters that the finale packs a hell of a punch, rounding off a brilliant experience and one of the best films you're likely to see this year.",In Bruges
304,rudimir-bombardinovic,Bruges is a stage,9,29 January 2009,"If I had to describe ""In Bruges"" in one word it would be - theater. Because that's how I felt after I saw it.Story about two Irish hit men (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell) who were sent to hide in Bruges by their boss (Ralph Fiennes) is dark comedy with brilliant screenplay. Dialogue is just fantastic, it's incredible how you can be pulled to screen watching dialogue about midget war or touristic attraction of Bruges. But don't be fooled - behind, on first sight, irrelevant conversations and witty dialogues lie existentialistic questions about life and death and everything between. Why theater? Well, through this brilliant dialogue (base of every good play), in Bruges as stage, develops relationship between four main characters - nihilist Ray (Collin Farrell), experienced Ken (Brendan Gleeson), energetic Harry (Ralph Fiennes) and Bruges itself. Besides this there are great supporting characters - hotel owner Marie (Thekla Reuten), midget Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), Ray's girlfriend Chloe (Clemence Poesi) and many others. Acting is excellent with actors fitting roles perfectly. Very nice surprise is Collin Farrell who has proved he can carry film as leading actor.With European touch of Martin McDonagh ""In Bruges"" became one of the best films I saw this year, if not the best. What needs to be mentioned again is outstanding script.So, was the play good? Brilliant.I even think Shakespeare would like it.",In Bruges
305,av-spam,Almost great,7,25 January 2020,"But not quite :( Ralph Fiennes' character, acting and lines are a little over the top and contrived at times which lets the whole film down.

306,john-souray,Cynical and derivative,3,16 January 2009,"I wasn't going to review this, but a recent rash of award nominations together with encouragement from people like Barry Norman (the UK film critic) provokes it. A characteristically attractive central performance by Brendan Gleeson (too good for this material) and at least competent performances by Farrell and Fiennes conceal the profound moral emptiness and cynicism at the heart of this film, which blatantly attempts to assemble the components of a cult hit. Add a dash of Tarantino dialogue, the comic cinematic dwarf from ""Living in Oblivion"", the psychopathic geezer-gangster from Sexy Beast; even the title is probably a steal (though in different circumstances it could have been quite a funny one; American readers should know that there is a satirical magazine in the UK called Private Eye, a bit like your ""Onion"", and in Private Eye there is a running joke about an imaginary film called ""They flew to Bruges"", which successfully captures everything about the sort of worthy and desperately unglamorous black-and-white 1950s war film that you might doze off to on a Sunday afternoon's telly).But look: it takes more than adding a few effs and jeffs to the dialogue to make you Tarantino. You have to have an ear for real speech to make this work. All we get here is just pointless foul-mouthedness, but with not one memorable or quotable line in the whole thing. Compare this to, for example, Armando Ianucci's ""The thick of it"" (A TV political satire), where a character hovering in a doorway is told to ""Come the f*** in or f*** the f*** off""; now that's funny, creative swearing. In ""In Bruges"" it's just depressing and relentless. Still, the director and producers are enormously proud of their potty-mouths, as they devote a whole DVD extra to counting the instances. ""Oh, grow up"", is the only response I can muster.These three central characters are two hit men and their psycho boss. Gleeson's character can remain appealing enough as we are told little enough about the hard realities of his background, but Farrell (the ostensible lead, with whom we are supposed to sympathise), is on the run in Bruges (this isn't a spoiler as it's clear early on) because of a ""hit"" that's gone wrong, resulting in the death of an innocent child (a choirboy, no less). Still, any moral qualms one might have about rooting for these dangerous sociopaths can be conveniently be put to one side because the ""hit"" that went wrong was on a priest who had been interfering with children. A paedo! So that's alright then; never mind that their more normal business is enforcing with violence the trades of prostitution and protection and drugs, not to mention narcissistic concepts of ""respect""; he was attempting to shoot a paedo, so the collateral killing of a child is just another comic blunder.As for the denouement, which I don't need (and can't be bothered)to introduce spoiler warnings for: preposterous, just preposterous. If the contrived ending had introduced some moral shape (even if just a subversive or nihilistic one) to the proceedings, there might have been some redemptive power. Instead, all it does is just emphasise the cynical way in which the ingredients, including the calculated taunting of imagined ""political correctness"", have been mixed together. Not to mention their sheer implausibility.Not clever, not funny, not original, not satirical, not cutting-edge or black comedy, not even realistic; just a nasty taste in the mouth.",In Bruges
307,jrwollscheid,Maybe the GREATEST dark comedy of all time,10,15 December 2020,"I just love this movie so much. It does everything so perfectly and iconically. The film is simply a masterpiece. The film centers around two hitmen hiding out in Bruges, Belgium following a crime gone wrong.Negatives: NonePositives: The film is perfect in every way. The comedy is just hilarious and set up so well by the writing. The film will have you laughing at horrible things because of just how well written the scenes are. Martin McDonagh did such a great job with this movie as his direction of this movie as well as his writing of the movie are both perfect. The movie never seems to have a dull moment and the score of the movie does a great job of having silence along with a hauntingly beautiful accompaniment. The film has the entire feeling of a storybook in its shooting which is easily backdropped by the rustic feeling of Bruges. The acting in the film is also top notch as Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes all give wonderfully amazing performances. The cast as a whole give great performances. The film is also a Christmas movie as the whole of the film takes place at Christmastime.The movie is simply a must-watch and a film that is easily one of my all time favorites.

It is extremely endearing, gory, violent, funny, tender, but most of all it is a compellingly human film. It charts a handful of days in the lives of two hired killers, after a job in London goes wrong, and they are sent to ""cool off and lay low"" in a rather unexpected place: Brujes, Belgium.The reason they are sent there becomes apparent once we have already been drawn well into the plot, and have developed empathy for the main characters, which makes everything that happens to them in the final act all the more resonant.Without spoiling it, as I believe this film is one of the least predictable ones I have seen in years, the reason they are sent to this little-known place (in Cinema, at least) partly involves the fact that ""Brujes is like a fairy tale city"".Since I dearly treasure the feeling of going to the cinema and being pleasantly surprised throughout the length of a film, both by its quality acting and original plot, I shall simply tell you that I was amused and laughed throughout, I felt pity, I felt pain, I felt hope.

I've always been a Colin Farrell fan, but I think this movie will impress everyone with Colin Farrell. The editing of the movie is so good that you watch it out of breath. After I finished the movie, I listened to the soundtracks for a week and as I listened I found myself on the streets of Europe as shown in the movie. The film describes the beautiful loneliness of winter very well and it did not lose us in that loneliness. Also, the movie is such an impressive movie as well as a very funny movie. It is difficult to find so many different items in the same movie and I think it is a dangerous element, but this is not the case for the movie.

Amazing location shots that are set amongst beautiful and historic backdrops compliment Martin McDonagh's perfect direction. The acting in the film ranges from average to great, but Colin Farrell gives the performance of his career(which is obviously not a grueling task). The script was very inclusive and gave viewers aspects of dark comedy as well as straight comedy. All of this was mixed into a pot of social awareness, love story and satire. The beautifully brutal action sequences were perfectly distributed between the dry and scoreless dialogue. I believe In Bruges is one of the finest of 2008, I absolutely loved this film.",In Bruges

There are predictable parts, but they are often only foreshadowed by a few minutes. It is one of those great dark crime comedies that the Brits are so good at--a little lighter than Sexy Beast, a little darker than Snatch, but with a dream-like quality that shows just a touch of influence from Felini. Really fun flick. In a way the characters are a bit clichéd--especially Ralph Fienes' gangster, but that's no big deal.

In fact, I actually kept a COUNT... in the hour-and-45-min movie, I counted 130 ""F-bombs, 16 ""S-bombs,"" and 23 various other vulgar or obscene terms. That works out to 1.3 ""bombs"" per minute. This is QUALITY dialog? This is quality writing? I realize the subject matter isn't the most gentile of subjects, but my point is that I cared more about the language than I cared about the MOVIE! That does NOT speak well of a movie. If I had my druthers, I wished I could have my hour and 45 mins back, and spent it watching something more intelligent, like ""Wild Hogs!"" (P.S.

315,dyl_gon,"The only thing worse than being stuck in Bruges is watching ""In Bruges""!",3,8 February 2008,"In Bruges is one of those comedies that thinks it is far more witty and clever than it actually is. It's a shame, because it has an interesting premise with a lot of potential, but ultimately that potential amounts to nothing more than cussing and midget jokes.The film follows two hit men, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) who are ordered by their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes), to hide away in the remote Belgian town of Bruges after a botched hit in London. They are supposed to stay until Harry gives them a call saying it's OK to leave. Ken seizes the opportunity to explore and sightsee while Ray, who takes an instant disliking to Bruges, prefers to spend his time at the pub. While there, the duo have many strange encounters in Bruges, including ones with a midget actor, a skinhead robber, Dutch prostitutes, and involving loads of drugs, all which lead up to a matter of life-or-death situation involving Ray, Ken and Harry.In Bruges is a strange combination of a drama and a comedy, and it really fails in both genres. The movie is primarily a comedic one. Although there are a few jokes that were mildly funny, most of them fall flat. The problem is that In Bruges presents itself as ""sophisticated"" and tries to come off as clever, character-based comedy, yet half the jokes are incredibly low brow. For instance, there are repetitive jokes involving a midget. Even if the joke had been remotely funny in the first place (which it wasn't), it's repeated far too many times before the movie ends. Most of the jokes are mean-spirited and un-politically correct. Don't get me wrong, I normally wouldn't have a problem with that. However, here there is nothing funny. Ray ridicules overweight people, he karate chops the midget, he knocks out a couple in a restaurant, swears like a sailor and (once again with the midget) engages in a discussion about whether or not there will be a race war in the future. None of this is funny. It's cruel-spirited for the sake of it. The director must know that simply being mean-spirited isn't funny. There's nothing clever or witty about it. It's the same humor we've seen done before, in countless idiotic, low brow comedies, presented as a Sundance-approved, highbrow comedy.As well, it would've helped if the lead role was played by someone other than Colin Farrell. I like Farrell; he's a good actor. He is not a comedic actor though. He's just not funny. It's as simple as that. His performance here is good, but he's not funny enough for a movie like this. His character gets most of the better lines in the film and they are all wasted. Ralph Fiennes fairs much better comically, yet is relegated to the last 30 minutes of the film.The rest of the movie is a mess, as it strives to be a thought-provoking drama, as well as an action film towards the end. There are long periods of the movie devoid of jokes, which would be fine if anything were happening. Unfortunately, for the first hour of the film, nothing much happens. Ray and Ken stumble around Bruges doing random things. It's boring and dull. There are a few emotional moments here and there, and although they are well done, they don't fit in with the rest of the movie, which is often crude and crass. The last 20 minutes has some good action, violence and shoot-outs, but which once again, really has no place in this film. The ending switches gears from this and attempts to be profound. It feels out of place. ""Hot Fuzz"", which came out almost a year ago and had a similar premise, stuck primarily to the comedy genre and succeeded. In Bruges tries to blend together comedy and drama, trying to be profound, rude, funny and thrilling. It's too much and the film would've worked better if it had focused more on one of these areas.All in all, I can't say I recommend In Bruges. It's a jumbled mess of a film that thinks much too highly of itself. The only thing worse than being stuck in Bruges would be having to watch this film again.",In Bruges

The screenplay overall was outstanding.I thought the score was weak at first but now I hear it in my head still and think of the atmosphere the movie, an almost eerie sound which fit well.The character development was impeccable, I really feel as if I know them and the exchanges back and forth were hysterical.Finally one of the best movie moments ever: ""He was about to do your job for you by killing himself and you stopped him?!""",In Bruges

Val Kilmer is guilty too. Pretty sure nobody in ancient Greece had an Irish/British accent......anyways, really liked Colin in this movie. He did an outstanding job.

Usually, when i have big expectations I often get disappointed, but not this time. I don't like Collin Farell as a actor much, but that not turn me down for watching movie. In this title he is really convincing and giving his effort to the top and I had to say that after this movie I have bigger respect for him. This is a story of a two friend who are arriving in Belgium medieval city Bruges. To Ray which playing by Farell is not very impressed with city and he thinks that is boring so he often spending time at pubs. Suddenly, he meet a good-looking girl and he get heated for her, but he doesn't know that his friend Ken must kill him for his sin from the past... This is not movie which is build on action, it's slowly paced movie which is main component an atmosphere. Atmosphere is what movie giving a special feeling connected with really great music with piano. On my opinion it deserve an Oscar for music theme. This is story of man who is persecuted by the demons of his past, by the committed crime for which complains deeply, because he meet the woman of his life he suddenly begin to be aware of his sins. Maybe I shouldn't recommend this to fans of fast paced action, because it isn't. This is an interesting movie with great atmosphere and well acted performance.

319,Cinemafou,Delightful Tour De force,9,7 August 2015,"I don't need to repeat anything about the plot line since you have already read it, or should have. In any event I found this film to be a wonderful diversion. What we soon learn is that the two hit men are completely unsuited to the job. They are complex, morally conflicted and emotional, while their employer is a cynical psychopath. Having some time off with these two in the Belgian city of Bruges during Christmas allows us to move about the old city on a sight seeing tour, punctuated with serendipitous or chaotic encounters with other people and interactions between the two leads. Along with the Christmas lights there is some violence, but it is integral to the black comedy aspect of the film. Some of the violence is quite comical.The addition of a film in production within this film adds another level. Two of the supporting characters come out of that inner film, in a certain way providing a connection between waking and dreaming. Bit parts played by people in fantastic costumes add to the magic of what might otherwise be a purely dark scene.All the characters are very carefully crafted. As another review stated this is (in part) a character study. It is also designed to be very entertaining, which it is. I enjoyed it immensely. A bit slow moving at times, but this is a European film which holds the value of the stage very high, yet it does not appear staged. It puts you right there.

But it also has a great story that is hard to predict where it will go. At the beginning of the movie I thought to myself it could well do without Colin Farrell, but by the end he had won me over. I particularly liked the bit about the guy not letting Brendan G's character into the tower because he was short 0.10. I lived in Belgium for 2 years and this is absolutely what they would do - most uptight people I've ever encountered in my life. (I actually got kicked off a train in Brugge because my train pass had been improperly stamped. Mind you, I'm not the one that did the stamping.)Brugge is one of the most spectacularly beautiful cities I've ever been to and this film does it justice with it's cinematography and storyline.

Like Bruges, you go to this film because it is poignant and beautiful, but at times gets boring. Or, at least, it should be boring.

For those who are looking for a feel good movie this is not the case... Go for something with Luke Wilson or Jim Carrey... This movie is totally brutal!... It hurts in the end...:(",In Bruges
324,holker-127-845774,Disappointing black comedy becomes a fascinating surreal movie,7,13 August 2011,"I watched this film expecting to see a brilliant dark comedy, but I didn't find the jokes funny at all. It was indeed dark, but slow paced and half-way through I was thinking of giving this boring film just 5 stars.But then the story became very surreal and interesting. I started to wonder if Ray was already dead and Bruges itself actually symbolised purgatory, where good (Ken) and evil (Harry) were fighting for Ray's soul.Still not sure what to make of this flick, but I kinda like it now. 7/10",In Bruges
325,xaniver,HIlarious,9,2 October 2014,"This movie had me in tears... from laughter. I had absolutely no expectations going into this and didn't expect to laugh half as much as I did. Colin Farrell is brilliant as the not-so-smart thug. His dialog and facial expressions provide much of the comedy in this film.The setting - Bruges, Belgium - makes for quaint and romantic scenery somewhat at odds with the brutish storyline which only adds to the quirk. Brendan Gleeson is classic as always, fueling the comedic fires even when they burn black.This film exceeded all my expectations and is definitely up there with Guy Ritchie films like Snatch. Like those films though, you might need subtitles even if you're an English speaker given those thick Irish accents.",In Bruges
326,OmarHartwellWhite,"One of My Favorite recent Movies. Hilarious, smart and features great dialogue and is highly original",10,13 May 2014,"I highly recommend this film for any Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie films, but really to any lover of film. There is a reason film's like this aren't big Hollywood block buster hits, because it is a highly original, dialogue driven film that will go places you couldn't foresee happening. This is a hilarious dark comedy (which may be a little to dark for some, especially one scene in particular about mid way through), but I really consider it more of a crime drama than a comedy. The best way to watch this film is to watch it without seeing any trailers or reading any reviews that contain spoilers so you can get the best experience when you watch it. The premise seems simple, two hit men hiding out after a recent job, but trust me when I say it is much more complex than that. If you enjoy this film I highly recommend watching Martin Mcdonagh's second feature, Seven Psychopaths. Also, I haven't seen many Short's but his first and only short ""Six Shooter""(Which Won an Academy Award) I have seen many times, its only about 30minutes in length and features a simple premise as well, but it is a powerful 30 minutes and you can watch the entire thing for free on youtube ( just search ""Six Shooter Martin Mcdonagh"").",In Bruges

It is advertised as an intelligent comedy then we see a boy (about 10 years old) murdered by a head shot (yeah, comedy!) and the murderer, hiding in Bruges, picks up a local lady, tells her on a dinner date that he is a hired gun and starts a bar brawl with their neighbor and his girlfriend (yeah, intelligent!).i suppose no police arrived at the scene, arrested him, and compared his fingerprints to the one he left on a sheet of paper that belonged to the boy he murdered (we saw him do that in the murder scene).i'm sorry, but i really don't know why I should care for stories taking place in this parallel universe.",In Bruges
328,mike-adly5,In a Nutshell Masterpiece: In Bruges (8.5/10),9,8 December 2010,"In Bruges...""You've got to stick to your principles""Defining the genre of Dark Comedy, In Bruges presents a cinematic course of continuously entertaining dialogues in a classic clash of humour and drama. A story of two hit men, ""Ray"" (Collin Farrell) and ""Ken"" (Brendan Gleeson), sent on time off in Bruges, Belgium by their boss ""Harry"" (Ralph Fiennes) after a tough job. During the few days they spend in the little gloomy town, circumstances lead them to show more of their characters and their thoughts on different matters of life.As you watch In Bruges you can't help getting pulled right into the plot and what it presents from dramatic reality. The key to that is none other than the actual setting of the movie. Think about this; the most preserved medieval town in Belgium, old buildings and little canals, and two Irishmen trying to make something of it. It all makes the place itself very interesting to the viewer even while Collin Farrell keeps going at it as being a s*** hole. Bruges may not make it to the top the viewers' favourite cities list but what makes it very fit for this film is its dull atmosphere and cloudy layout where morning scenes are as dark and gloomy as night ones; an essential element for shooting a black comedy.Evidently the strongest, most significant factor that makes In Bruges an anything but ordinary kind of film is its Oscar nominated screenplay. A rich flow of dialogues and random conversations, so irrelevant and so inappropriate sometimes that it daringly shows the awkward reality of different life situations usually acted out differently in the movies. This appears clearly in what I consider one of the most enjoyable phone conversations ever acted on the big screen; it's Harry (Fiennes) vs. Ken (Gleeson) talking about Bruges and how Ray (Farrell) feels about it. Even the excessive swearing and the use of the F word 126 times throughout the film help darken the dialogues and perfecting them for one of the most inspirational black comedies in the history of the genre.But there's always something special about any movie that's written and directed by the same person. When you take a closer look at In Bruges, you figure that Martin McDonagh has shown pure brilliance in directing his very own tight script. Having created the story himself, his presentation constantly gives a hint of pure originality in every scene. The dramatic depth of In Bruges is only deepened even more by what I believe to be the perfect cast; it's one of those rare movies where you think the writer thought of the actor even before the character itself was written. Farrell, Gleeson and Fiennes, each an acting phenomenon on his own, fill in their roles in a quite convincing manner; good enough to earn Collin Farrell a Golden Globe in 2008.In a nutshell, In Bruges is one deep sophisticated yet simple story, full of morals and symbols. It is funny, it is dark and it is fully entertaining. The piano score, the medieval city and the awkward conversations, all make it quite the ride, the kind of ride you don't miss.",In Bruges
329,GodsPrototype,They're Filming Midgets,9,4 April 2009,"I saw this movie having read good reviews and heard good things about it so initially I was a bit wary of it and didn't want to build it up too much. It was one of those films that I wasn't really too keen on seeing...but my only regret now is that i should have seen it sooner.The film is different to what the trailers make out especially the first two thirds but it is swiftly made up for in the final third. The script is brilliant and full kudos must go to the writer and director for bringing such a brilliant piece of art to the big screen, because art is what it is. From the characters to the city of Bruges itself and references to the whole film being set in some kind of purgatory.(Spoilers to follow) There is one scene where the characters brilliantly played by Brendan Gleeson & Colin Farrell are looking at a picture in an art gallery regarding that strange place in between Heaven & Hell, this picture completely sums up one of the main themes in the piece and is excellently portrayed as a foggy reality at the end of the movie in the back streets of Bruges.The story seems relatively simple; 2 hit men hiding out in Belgium awaiting a phone call from their boss (played fantastically well by Ralph Fiennes) just try to get through 2 weeks in the city. Brendan Gleeson's character wants to make the most of it and go sightseeing and Colin's Character is just so bored, all he wants to do is get drunk.It is the first half of the film that makes it really stand out for me, not saying that the second half is bad, because it's not, Ralph Fiennes owns the second half of the film with such forceful acting and brilliant dialogue that it completely changes the scope of the movie. The first half is so well written and so brilliantly funny. I wasn't laughing at first but after a little bit of getting to know the characters it became virtually hilarious at some points.Brendan Gleeson is one of the most underrated actors we have in the UK and I think that this is one of his best performance aside from maybe 'Gangs of New York' and I will always remember the look he had on his face after he'd taken a gram of cocaine, absolutely hilarious! the comedy is very well done and I implore you not to smirk throughout this film.Saying that there is some dark subject matter that is not to everyone's taste and it does get pretty violent toward the end but it is predominantly a film about hit men so you have to expect that. Some people won't necessarily like the ending but I thought it was very apt and made the film a perfect singular entity.In summary of the film, the acting is top notch with all three main performers outdoing themselves, the film is brilliantly conceived and directed. The mix of pure comedy & violence has a perfect equilibrium and it has some very memorable characters throughout.So if you wanna see a film involving hit men, scams, prostitutes, fat Americans, midgets, a hot pregnant woman & endless bizarre characters all superbly interweaved into an outstanding film with comedy & violence then I totally recommend this movie. An unexpected & oustanding experience. 9/10",In Bruges
330,Skriptman,There's something about the Irish...,8,8 February 2008,"Can't quite put a finger on it, but there's something about the Irish that knits humor, pathos and grit together like few others can. Jim Sheridan, Danny Boyle, Terry Loane and Kenneth Branaugh do it exceedingly well. This offering by Martin McDonagh -- in only his first feature -- is no exception. He's aided, mind you, by exceptional performances (Brendan Gleeson, Colin Farrell and Ralph Fiennes doing terrific turns with some very offbeat, ""sideways"" characters) and his own competent script.The one shortcoming is the over-the-top scene where Ray, Ken and ""midget"" Jimmy indulge in cocaine, booze and off-the-wall banter about racial wars. The scene comes across as an intrusion, a dark throwaway, one that is out of place in an otherwise gripping story of characters who have chosen a questionable -- but intriguing -- profession.Not your typical Hollywood ending by a long shot -- but probably more satisfying especially because it's not. Worth seeing.",In Bruges
331,airfoyle,Enjoyable but implausible,7,25 December 2008,"I really enjoyed this movie, right up until the very end. One is not convinced that the last act of extreme violence would have been committed. There are other implausibilities as well. Why would the beautiful Belgian girl fall for one of the hit men so quickly and in spite of so much evidence that he is someone to stay away from?But the two hit men are so well played by Gleason and Farrell that one forgives almost anything. They get pulled into various scenes that are absurd to the point of surrealism, and draw you in quickly to the humor, suspense, or both that Martin McDonagh has written into them.I'll be very interested in McDonagh's next film.",In Bruges
332,lantern4444,Unusual Crime Drama,8,8 February 2016,This action drama centers around three characters from a criminal organisation. Two hit men and their boss become involved in a situation that creates unusual circumstances and outcomes. The relationship between the characters are complex and change continually throughout the movie. The movie is also set in a town in Belgium which creates a different setting and environment from the main characters own experience. Many local characters also become involved with the hit men developing additional story lines that interweave with the overall direction of the film. Many of the characters are quirky giving the movie a slight art house appeal. They acting is great which allows the usual characters to be believable in the situations at hand. This is a great crime drama with a number of twists and a different overall ending than expected.,In Bruges

In 2008, when the film was released, I've heard the name, but it passed me; so I thought, this time I'll definitely watch it. To be true, I've could well be done without. Recalling Guy Ritchie,s films, I've at least laughed watching them. This one left me absolutely idle. I am becoming old, perhaps. But tiny surface emotions don't touch, even with great dose of Irishness, brilliant actors and a lot of senseless shooting, ""strong bloody violence, pervasive language and some drug use""...

334,clemtine,Even criminals have hearts.,7,6 July 2008,"A rather ironic film mixing crime with morals. The first half is rather slow that you start wondering what the fuss is all about but the last twenty-something minutes is a really rewarding finish to this quite thought-provoking film. Colin Farrell plays a hit-man who is bothered by guilt because of the serious fuckup he commits on his first assignment. He is sent to Bruges together with a colleague to initially lie low for a while. As the plot unfolds and the real reason why they are in Bruges is uncovered, the story thickens as the audience begins to sympathize with the unusual leads. This film presents the much debated upon idea that no one is either purely good or just downright evil. It proves in very unlikely ways that even criminals have hearts and even the worst kind of people can be honorable. It is a very simple story that is worth a viewing and I guarantee that it won't leave your head even long after the credits are over.http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews",In Bruges

339,kerryhill123,Not at all bad,7,5 June 2014,"In Bruges is a British black comedy film directed by Martin McDonagh, released in 2008. It follows a pair of hit men named Ken and Ray who are hiding out in the Belgian town of Bruges after Ray accidentally murders a child during one of his jobs. I found this film pretty entertaining throughout, it had clever, witty dialogue which conveyed both characters very well. The characters themselves are very convincing and both very 3 dimensional, the relationship between them both is presented very well as it shows their closeness and shows their emotion despite having a seemingly emotionless job. I thought the dialogue and acting was extremely credible to Farrell as he perfectly conveys Ray's fragile state of mind and presents his character differently to how you'd expect. The story itself was pretty basic but well written and perhaps the only part of the film that let it down was the ending, which I was not fully satisfied with. I feel like it was a little unconvincing and unrealistic with there being a shootout in the middle of a film set and no one seems to take any action and prefers to carry on with their business! I think this was a bit of a silly sequence and although the fate of the characters was relatively appropriate, I still feel it wasn't authentic enough. This film was set in a beautiful location and when it isn't making you laugh or wince, it instils emotion into the viewer with its stunning soundtrack and appropriate cinematography. The cinematography was very revealing for the characters and shows off the setting of the film extremely well. It also intensifies the dialogue and importance of scenes. The editing of the narrative was quite clever and I liked how we found out what Ray had done after he sees two children walking with their parents. It was an appropriate link and therefore a good time to reveal Ray's actions.",In Bruges
340,u2bme102,Not as good as I had hoped,6,11 May 2008,"I had high hopes for this movie. Roeper and Whoever made it sound as though it was one of the best movies of the year, and hilarious.It was pretty good, but it was not great, and I don't know exactly why.It had a few laughs, but it was not a comedy.Two hit men go to Bruges (pronounced Brooj) after a hit. The person who hired them sends them there, supposedly for a little r & r after a hit. One of the hit men, played by Brendan Gleeson, soaks in the history. The other, played by Collin Farrell, is bored to tears, until he meets a local woman. She has an ex-boyfriend. She also deals drugs to a movie cast and crew, who are filming in Bruges.We don't know why the hit men (well, actually, the hit man - Farrell was the hit man, Gleeson was the person who recruited him) were hired to do the job, or why the hit was commissioned, but this was not important anyway. Ralph Fiennes plays the guy who called for the hit.oh - there's also the hostess of the hotel (or was it a b & b) where Farrell and Gleason are staying in Bruges. She's pregnant.I'm not going to say too much more, because to do so would give away too much of the plot.The acting was fine. Gleeson especially shines. Ralph Fiennes is properly menacing. Farrell does a pretty good job as a novice hit man. The women are fine, although they really aren't given much to do with their parts.The movie was entertaining, and it held my interest, and it was a nice change of pace from a Hollywood story, but I can't highly recommend the movie.It was worth the price of a matinée, plus a medium popcorn and soda.",In Bruges
341,bencaandrew,Refreshing Dark Comedy,8,9 January 2018,"Whilst the start of the film is somewhat slow and unconvincing, this sets the tone for the rest of the film, and a great tone at that. Collin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson have great chemistry as the two hitman friends, whilst Ralf Fiennes is exceptional in his role as the psychopathic boss. The funny moments are set up by earlier comments, and the ridiculous moments almost seem plausible thanks to the consistent alt-reality tone of the film and the great work of Collin Farrell and Ralf Fiennes to support this. The script is unapologetic in its potential for offense but well crafted and with great hidden meaning in the metaphors of purgatory etc. Overall this is a fun and relatively original film, well worth a watch.",In Bruges

Anyway I suspect my comments are confusing and unclear but in a way that is what you kind of experience with these films.One curious thing about the end titles, a fine actor who has a minor speaking role was not credited.

344,sammyocarr,Emotionaly Turbulent,6,1 September 2008,"Set in a foreign Idyliic medieval town, 'In Bruges' sees two Irish hit men endure time together ,with Brendan Gleeson portraying Ken, and Colin Farrell as Ray, these sort of films live or die based on the quality of acting, this film certainly lives. The film initially takes on characteristics of a classic foreign film, simple camera techniques, and frequent pans of the setting and scenery, its the acting which sets this film apart. Emotionally high scenes are performed beautifully, and subtle conversations executed perfectly. Farrell certainly deserves credit for his cynical teen like attitude during sight seeing, whilst Gleeson takes on a fatherly figure.The writing and dialogue is rich, with frequent use of swearing and clever dark comedy. In Bruges has a vast variety of scenes, such as shoot-outs, drug use, and conversations of the afterlife. My Favorite Three scenes or actions are as followed: Farrell punching a woman after being threatened with a bottle. Farrell karate chopping a cocaine abusing midget. Farrell firing blanks into the face of a skin headed puff.In Bruges has many elements, romance, violence, comedy and action.It is a great film due mainly to the writing and of course, the acting. From laughs and jokes in a pub, to suicide and gun fights. The film keeps your attention right till the Cliff hanger ending, and despite Farrell killing a young boy, you find yourself hoping he doesn't die, even if it means having to stay in 'Fucking Bruge'",In Bruges
345,cbrueggemeyer,"Overall, In Bruges's action-filled satirical plot makes it one of the best films of the decade.",9,21 April 2011,"I thought that this movie's story was excellent. The characters help guide the audience through the different twist and turns of the story. This movie is very different than a lot of popular comedy/action movies because it is dark and depressing. Most comedy/action movies such as Kiss Kiss Bang Bang or Rush Hour have a bright uplifting plot that entices the audience, but also puts them in a good mood. In Bruges is the opposite of this. It still has a very enthralling plot, but this movie leaves you feeling satisfied and also slightly depressed in the end, considering that almost every vital character dies. The director, Martin McDonagh, includes very dark themes such as suicide and loss of self-identity in this movie, but somehow this movie still has a witty comedic undertone. Overall, In Bruges's action-filled satirical plot makes it one of the best films of the decade. The Cinematography and Editing in the film In Bruges is excellent. The town of Bruges is a magical medieval town that is expressed with great beauty in this movie. Almost every person that sees this movie will instantly fall in love with the town of Bruges. The beautiful canals and parks make this city one of the most beautiful in the world, cinematically and in real life. One of the most breathtaking scenes is when Ken first goes to the top of the clock tower. The camera pans out onto a beautiful horizon of classical medieval buildings as far as the eye can see. Also, this movie makes great use of the quick, dark shots of the main characters with half of their face in shadow and half in light. This technique can be seen in movies such as Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, and The Usual Suspects. A wonderful example of this technique is the scene where Ray is in the confessional with the priest. The camera shows a great shot of the divider between the confessional, showing the priest's dark face as he talks to Ray. Another great sequence in this scene is when the camera follows Ray as he follows the crawling priest into the main chapel. The editing in this movie is also great. Every scene in the movie serves a specific purpose, and all of the actors seem to know their role in every scene. The movie seems the perfect length, the length where you get the full effect of the movie without being hackneyed by the same characters and setting. Overall, I think that the cinematography and editing in this movie are great, and they are two of the many things that add up to make this movie great.The acting in In Bruges is wonderful. The actors all serve a specific purpose, and they portray their characters with poise and accuracy. Many of these actors have little or no experience, but they still portray their characters with the effectiveness of a veteran. Colin Farrell plays Ray, the energetic but lonely rookie hit man that struggles with the guilt of killing a young boy. Farrell plays this role with Oscar wining effort. He goes from one minute being a funny, outgoing young man to bearing the stress and loneliness that seems to come with the job. Farrell's facial expressions in this movie pretty much make the movie. Whether he is displaying a comic, sarcastic face responding to a remark by his partner, or the sad, dreary look of a man without a cause, Farrell executes his role to perfection, and once again shows why he is one of the best actors in Hollywood. Brendan Gleeson plays the calm, surprisingly moral filled character of Ken. Gleeson plays the role of Ken with the acting skills of a seasoned veteran with something to prove. Before this, Gleeson has played minor supporting roles such as Reynald de Chatillon in Kingdom of Heaven and Monk McGinn in the Scorsese hit Gangs of New York. Gleeson's role in this movie is much more important to the plot, and he plays this role wonderfully. Gleeson is the calm, collective character that keeps this movie in check. In the face of extreme action, danger, and chaos, the character of Ken seems to hold the movie together at the seams. I would compare Gleeson's character of Ken to William Holden's character of Pike Bishop in the movie The Wild Bunch. Both characters seem like bad people based on the roles they have in society, but towards the end both characters end up showing moralistic values such as risking their own lives for another. The acting in this movie is unbelievable, and it continues to blow me away. The direction of the film In Bruges is great. The director, Martin McDonagh, has made this movie great through his use of dark, action-filled scenes. McDonagh cleverly puts funny comedic relief in the form of the character Ray throughout the movie to keep the audience involved in the movie without feeling dreary and depressed. He entices the audience with fast, action scenes, and dramatic scenes that make us question our own sanity. Through McDonagh's great characters and casting, he has effectively portrayed the overall emotion and conflict of the story line. McDonagh is like the Harper Lee of directing, in that he has made only 1 movie (and one short film) and seeks to end his filmmaking career. This will strengthen McDonagh's prestige as a director in years to come, as he will always be remembered as being a great director. Besides in the sound department, it seems that McDonagh has completely mastered the art of directing, and it is a shame that he will no longer continue his once great legacy.",In Bruges
346,awillawill,"A great story, but badly executed",3,24 August 2008,"Reading through some of the other reviews for In Bruges, I began to wonder if I had seen a different film.The one my wife and I saw  on DVD  had a great story, but a story that was destroyed by over-wordy, heavy-handed and unfunny dialogue and a director who seemed unsure of what he wanted the film to be. Was it supposed to be farce? Perhaps a gentle comedy? Maybe a thriller with comedy overtones? Perhaps a black comedy? Who knows? At times we felt we were watching an episode of the British TV sitcom ""Father Ted"", but without the fun.As I have already stated, it was a great story, but it needed two primary changes: A script-editor with a ruthless approach to dialogue and a director with a true sense of what the film should have been.Finally, a thought: imagine what a wondrous film this would have been with the Coen Brothers at the helm.",In Bruges
347,standeman1984,"Great film, pure and simple",9,29 April 2008,"After the Oscar success of Six Shooter, and a great reputation as a play write, much was expected of Martin McDonagh's first feature film. He duly delivers with In Bruges, a fantastic film with commercial appeal that renews faith in British film.The story is simple, and on the surface may draw groans from people sick to death of British cinema's never-ending obsession with gangster films: two Irish criminals must lay low in Bruges for two weeks while the 'heat' from a bungled hit in London passes. As they wait on a phone call from their boss, one of the men is keen to explore this new town, making the most of his time there, while the other despairs at being in a place he compares to purgatory, failing to see the point in going round looking at buildings. All he wants to do is drink Belgian beer and wait it out. Meanwhile, in London, their boss (cockney gangster a la Don Logan) begins to reveal the real reason for sending them to this town...First of all, the location is master stroke. A picturesque town in Europe that not many will have heard of before, as the poster points out, below the title in brackets it says: (it's in Belgium). This is the first of many jokes delivered with aplomb. As for the acting and characters, at first i wasn't sure i was going to like Colin Farrel's character. He seemed ignorant, annoying and a little OTT, but he quickly grew on me, especially when his interest is finally sparked not by the prospect of sightseeing but instead by a midget on a film set. As more is revealed about his character, the more i liked him. As for Brendan Gleeson, who was also in Six Shooter, he is a very good actor, versatile and intelligent, he has a face that draws you in and keeps you comfortable. Ralph Fiennes as Harry, the boss with a clear code of ethics and conduct, is blatantly doing an impression of Don Logan from Sexy Beast, but he does a good job and by the end we find this is not only amusing but appropriate to the plot line. The other performance worthy of noting is that of Elizabeth Berrington, who plays the beautiful Dutch love interest for Colin Farrel. Her accent is convincing and her character is cheekily likable.The script is brilliant, full of jokes, satire and poignant moments. The story fizzes along and on reflection not a second of screen time seemed wasted. The plot ties everything in by the end, but refuses to end sympathetically. The final twenty minutes or so do become very dark, and those familiar with Six Shooter may not be surprised by this, or McDonagh's ability to retain the humour and believability despite the nasty things that occur. This is best demonstrated by the self-effacing humour as the film knowingly sends up previous gangster films whilst never really feeling too familiar.All in all, i went to see this expecting it to be good, and was happy to find it is better than that. The audience in the screening i attended also thoroughly enjoyed it, laughing all the way through and passing positive comments afterwards. I can't wait for Martin McDonagh's next film, it seems we Brits have another star director in the making.",In Bruges
348,robert-b-norby,The only movie I have ever given 10 stars,10,27 September 2017,"It's hard for me to start reviewing this movie, and I actually don't think I can explain why I give this a 10. But I will sure as hell try.The first time I saw this movie, I was delighted. 8 out of 10! Entertaining, strong and funny. I was delighted at the originality, but still, there's not so much of it that the movie becomes only watchable for the specially interested. I am not that type of person after all. It got the basics down (and down hard) for what makes a good movie: A good intriguing introduction, a ""problem"" that needs solving(comes perhaps a bit late), characters you like and can sympathize with, a steady build-up/drama curve until the end, very welcoming visual display, camera work, a powerful finish, and magnificent music all the way. But this alone doesn't make it reach the very top. There are a few other movies that delivers that too. Somehow I liked it more than I was aware of at first, and so I had to watch it again (and again, and again).What puts this movie over the top for me, I think, is the incredibly entertaining, humorous, and mind puzzling dialogue that will make you think ""that would be so cool to actually say to someone in real life!"" or the kind of opposite ""what a horrible thing to say to someone"". The dialogue script for this movie is brilliant, and it invites emotions on so many levels. It took me several viewings to appreciate it at the level I do now (but please don't be scared off, this is still a kick as movie regardless of how many times you watch it! It's probably just me that's a bit slow).Along with the dialogue, the characters performing them is what makes this movie re-watchable - a trait not many movies have today in my opinion. They will bring up those emotions and that intrigue (and sell it to you), over and over again. And if that isn't good enough, did I mention magnificent music and imagery? Did I say humor? I believe it to more, but I can't put my finger on it. You cannot make a mistake by putting this on, and I am betting my entire integrity as someone with a often way too critical mind towards movies never having given out a 10 before, that this deserves so much more praise than it has gotten (and it has gotten quite a bit). I have my suspicions that the simple plot description of the movie makes people think they are gonna watch an action shooter, and the simple minded gets disappointed, which could explain the ""only"" 7,9 rating. So know this, while it has minor elements of action in it, this is not an action movie. It's a masterpiece of characters and drama/emotions, acting, integrity, humor and f**king inanimate objects, and if you have not seen it, you got yourself a gem to discover. This has been the go-to movie for me when I ask friends ""hey, have you seen this one?"", because it has against all odds escaped the radar of the major crowd. I leave you with this: I have not yet showed it to anyone who didn't directly thank me afterwards.",In Bruges
349,Bmovie,A sight worth seeing!,8,8 February 2008,"""If I'd grown up on a farm and was retarded, Bruges might impress me, but I didn't, so it doesn't."" I've never grown up, certainly not on a farm, and, as for the other criterion, it is best left to others to judge, but I was impressed by ""In Bruges!"" The sights of the Belgian town itself would make an attractive documentary and they serve as a perfect counterpoint to the sardonic humor that emanates from the characters from beginning to end of this film.When the ""frozen mist"" appears over the town, it becomes a ""fairy tale"" landscape, well, a fairy tale that includes hit men in repose; a girl on a film crew who sells a pharmacopoeia of drugs when not shilling for a skinhead who shoots blanks, figuratively and literally, fat Americans; boorish Canadians; rumors of a midget - excuse me - ""dwarf"" race war; very funny and very dark casual conversations; a horror in flashback and one of the bloodiest and most ethical shootouts to ever conclude a movie.Colin Farrell apparently has the current franchise on guilt-ridden, semi-clueless and almost entirely heedless characters who inadvertently plague their partners given his recent showing in Woody Allen's ""Cassandra's Dream."" In the previous film his character treads water barely keeping his guilt afloat in the pervasive gloom while in ""Bruges"" he swims with it on his back through dark and unforced humor and regret. Brendan Gleason provides a sturdy framework for the plot and the revelation of character. Clearly, it is one of his best performances - a hit-man with the face and fidelity of an old knight errant. Ralph Fiennes also sets the perfect tone as the criminal nobleman to whom Farrell and Gleason both owe allegiance and must confront with reluctant defiance. The erstwhile Fleur Delacour of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" Clémence Poésy, plays the drug dealer/mugger assistant with a (sort of) heart of gold (And, no, for once, that's not Peter Dinklage, the hardest working little person in movies, it's Jordan Prentice.) This appears to be director/writer's Martin McDonagh's full-length feature debut. Kudos!",In Bruges
350,YouSeenThat,The Iron Chef of karate-chopping midgets,8,26 December 2008,"I love a good black comedy  Miles Davis struck-match black. When I say 'black comedy', no, I'm not talking about Barbershop, or any other rubbish with Ice Cube in it, I'm talking about comedy that combines the morbid and grotesque in order to convey the absurdity and cruelty of life. So when I finally finished watching an advanced copy of 'In Bruges', the first thing I did was run out onto the street and scream ""Halle-bloody-lujah!"" to the sky well, figuratively. Finally a decent film! Here I was thinking that I was going to die without having watched at least two good films this year.Few cultures do black comedy better than the English/Irish.Writer/Director Martin McDonagh's first full-length feature film, In Bruges, tells the story of two contract killers who are forced to hole up in Bruges, Belgium after a recent hit in London goes south. Waiting on further instruction from their employer, the mysterious Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes), Ken (Brendan Gleeson) the older, seasoned professional and Ray (Colin Farrell) the younger, inexperienced rookie begin to realize how different their perspectives of life, death and redemption truly are.Let me say straight off the bat that In Bruges won't be everyone's cup of tea, but if you love dark British crime films like Lock Stock, chances are you will enjoy this offering from McDonagh. In Bruges can only be described is a multilayered breath of fresh air: it's violent, it's crass, it's absurd, it's touching, and it's as funny as hell.In Bruges revolves around two men with a unique sense of moral flexibility. Dumped onto a train and sent to Bruges in order to wait it out until the heat dies down from their last job  they have two weeks to wait for a phone call from their boss. So how do a couple of hired guns kill time in one of Europe's most intact medieval cities? They go sightseeing of course. The film instantly drops us into the interesting dynamic between the two lead characters Ken and Ray: Ken wants to get out and experience the culture and atmosphere of the city, while Ray is the complete opposite, content to stay in his hotel room and wallow in self-pity  that is until he meets a young woman on the set of a local film. As the story unfolds, we learn more about the botched hit in London, and as a result, we learn more about what motivates our two leads. Throw a drugged-up midget into the mix and our two hit men are set for an intriguing, if slightly predictable climax.I couldn't fault a great deal in terms of the acting or characters. At first I found it a little difficult to picture Brendan Gleeson as the seasoned contract killer, but any objections quickly faded-away as the story picked-up. Likewise with Colin Farrell's character  he did come across as a bit of a sniveling girl, not exactly Farrell's strong suit from an acting standpoint, but I soon forgot all about that the instant I became immersed in the story. Once it became evident that McDonagh opted-out of going with characters that resembled two-dimensional cardboard cut-outs from your typical Hollywood action film, the experience washed-over me in a satisfying wave. I went with the story I went on the journey... and I loved it.Why the hell can't Hollywood make these sorts of films: interesting characters, an engaging story, touching moments, and some wicked black humor? There I was, less than twenty minutes into the film and cackling my head off at Farrell's character insulting a group of rather rotund American tourists. Then it suddenly hit me like a bullet to the forehead, I can't remember laughing this hard or this much at any of the films I've reviewed recently. Combined. Get Smart and Hancock maybe resulted in one or two genuine laughs, but I was only twenty minutes into In Bruges and I already had a massive smile on my face. The laughs didn't stop there, trust me.Don't be worried if the name Martin McDonagh doesn't ring a bell, I hadn't heard of the guy before going into this film either. Having done a little research on the man since, it appears that McDonagh is quite an accomplished playwright-cum-filmmaker who has won more Olivier Awards for his plays than I've had hot meals. I suspect that the director's theatre experience is an integral part as to why In Bruges is such a great film  there's a sense of intimacy and polish to In Bruges that is such an important part of playwriting. Overall I really enjoyed In Bruges  an absolute breath of fresh air compared to the dreck that comes out of Hollywood these days. If God did exist, and if I actually believed in a god, I'd have to thank him for the dark wit of our European friends in the UK and Ireland. I only had two small criticisms of In Bruges. The first: without giving anything way, I must admit that the last fifteen minutes of the film were pretty predictable  but for me, I still loved every second of it. The second criticism: it almost felt like I was watching a Belgian Tourist Commission advertisement for Bruges - I'd almost swear that the director was getting a kick-back from the local government to bestow the virtues of Bruges and its incredible history... only to have that notion torn-away every time Collin Farrell's character mentioned how much of a hole Bruges was. Ultimately, neither of those minor niggles detracted from the film as a whole  if you love English black humor then In Bruges is absolutely worth the trip to the cinema or video store.Edited excerpt from: www.youseenthat.com",In Bruges
351,redzon19,what a charming and sentimental killer!,8,23 February 2011,"Bruges is a city full of middle-aged buildings in Belgium, and that makes this place a wonderful choice for sight-seeing. However, Ray might not agree with that since he keeps describing this place as a xx hole, and that's how the story begins Two professional killers in Bruges, with no one to kill and no mission to accomplish, which gives the most desperate condition you can imagine for a professional killer. The scenario is full of black humor that makes the story almost like a fairy tale, while there is obvious no happy ending of the story. The most ironic thing is their over reacted behavior toward the accidental killing of the little girl considering the jobs they do is about killing all the time. Somehow, it becomes unbearable when it comes to the little girl, for what? Maybe it's their remaining conscience or the so-called self-esteem. This is just weird to see such sentimental professional killers, but funny parts like Ken saved Ray from suicide the time he was supposed to kill him clearly described that all of them are not traditional killers, but with merciful heart.Colin Farrell's best achievement in acting, the lovely accent, incurably sentimental and great sense of humor made this extremely bizarre character, yet adorable! How strange that a professional killer appears so charming and compassionate, and even stranger is that we all buy it after he actually finished his first assassination. As to Brendan Gleeson, all the jokes and funny stuff wouldn't be so convincing if it's not for him, and the jumping scene, especially the jumping scene, is when he stands out in the movie and makes unforgettable impressions to the audiences. Last but not least, Ralf Fiennes plays his role like he always did, struggling between friendship and morality, not to mention his unshakable dignity for being a professional killer. There is just too much fun to watch all the chemistry and jokes they have made.The most touching scene is no doubt the time when Ken jumped off the tower to warn Ray about his danger, which made the most serious chapter of the story and leaves no debate about the reality. In other words, it just states that this is not joking for god's sake!",In Bruges
352,mnemon07,A great movie,9,30 March 2008,"I saw this movie yesterday. After reading the reviews here I thought that I am going to see a crime comedy, similar to that of Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Its not. Its a drama with comic reliefs, and I am not sure whether overusing ""Fu*king"" and ""Bruges is a sh*t hole"" is that funny or just suppose to ease the tension that the movie would have imposed on the audience otherwise. With that said, I really enjoyed the movie. It got a Tarantino like dialog, though its not a rip off. It has a beautiful setting of Bruges and I enjoyed Hieronymus Bosch references. Colin Farrell's performance is amazing and plot is interesting. There are few movies which I will think about months after watching them and I think this will be one of these movies.",In Bruges
353,ya1973,Hilarious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,9,19 June 2008,"This is such a fine piece of work, it is a laugh-out-loud movie with many surprising moments and so much wit. The blend of the dark side of things with comedy is superb. I think the genre is clear, it's black comedy. There are so many scenes when you actually expect the dialogue to develop differently (or actually the plot itself) and it's just so naturally funny. This is a movie that has to be watched in the original language, because the Irish comments and sense of humour is in itself hilarious. I would say except for the last 15 minutes, when I thought it was all going a bit over the top (which is why I give 9 out of 10), this is a very inventive, original way of storytelling, an intriguing plot, with character development, beautiful shots of Bruges and the sense of humour is just very deep, very fine, superb!",In Bruges
354,Topgallant,Different Kind of Hit Man Movie,8,19 November 2009,"Every budding film maker seems to cut his feature teeth on a hit man movie. In fact, I've always thought hit man movies should be in their own genre. Instead, they fall into the action/adventure category.In Bruges (pronounced like the sled, luge) is it's own kind of hit man movie. It breaks new ground in much the same way Pulp Fiction and The Professional did. But while Pulp Fiction is about cartoon characters who love to act 'cool' and hear themselves talk (can you tell I'm not a Tarantino fan?), and The Professional relies on the Lolita effect and blatant sentimentality for it's characterization (it still worked for me), In Bruges is filled with real humanity and real drama. It takes very, very few cheap shots, and those it does take seem to be the film maker winking at classic cinematic conventions.This doesn't mean the story is completely free of plot devices and such. There are McGuffins and other devices in all hit man movies. In Pulp Fiction it was the briefcase, in The Professional, the plant, to name just two. I won't give away the device in In Bruges but you'll know it immediately when you see it.The two main characters, played by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, the hit men, are not meant to be likable, but we empathize with them because of each one's emotional struggle. I like this about the movie. Bad characters doing bad things, and yet we feel for them because of what they're going through. However, not all the characters have the same emotional wallop. The two female characters aren't as deep, and one of them, Chloe, isn't the least bit likable to this viewer. Also, the character Harry, played by Ralph Fiennes, suffers slightly from a lack of screen time.I guessed the final resolution about five minutes before it arrived, and you'll probably see it coming, too. That's OK. You don't have to be entirely surprised by this movie to appreciate it.Lastly, I'm glad the writer/director edited out the scenes on the disk labeled ""deleted scenes."" The movie was much better leaving the audience to fill in the blanks on the individual back stories.",In Bruges
355,echozdog-1,Why haven't I heard of this movie??? WOW!,9,4 August 2009,"So I'm flicking through the pay channels last night and came across this movie just after the credits rolled. I see Collin Farrel and go hey ""I like that actor I think I'll watch"". I was immediately grabbed by the surreal dialog that goes on. This screen play was a work of genius. I don't know who Martin McDonagh is but I will be looking for what else he does and see it. I'm not sure how to say it but it has the right mix of drama and comedy that had me staying up until 1AM on the week day (and I have 4 kids). The cast was awesome. Colin Farrel plays the tortured soul of a hit man trying to come to terms with a hit gone bad and hating being in Bruges. Brendan Gleeson plays the other hit man who loves Bruges and wants to tour the town. The banter and dialog between the two of them and the town folks had me riveted and laughing for 2 hours. Then half way through Ralph Fiennes pops up in the movie. Ralph Fiennes! The twists and turns this movie makes blew me away. 9/10 (I only did the 9 because I guessed part of the ending 15 minutes before it happened)",In Bruges
356,greybitsdmg,"A highly enjoyable, multi-layered beauty of a film",9,19 April 2008,"I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, but every expectation I had was exceeded. It worked on so many levels. There were times when I was still laughing about a scene, when something more serious or moving happened to stop me dead in my tracks, and vice versa. But this didn't make it feel bitty as with poor editing, but quite a roller-coaster due to a sublime knack for timing. The dialogue was sharp, witty and at times poignant. Some of the conversations were just downright hilarious. Others so 'real', you knew you were listening to the work of a talented, perceptive writer. The acting was first rate throughout. Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell were outstanding (CF's performance should have his critics eating their words), yet I think the standard of the smaller roles really helped to take this film beyond a vehicle for the leads. Special mention to the hotel owner 'Natalie' (Elizabeth Berrington).The characterisation was spellbinding too. Just watch and see how subtly you're made to empathise with quite 'unsavoury' characters i.e., the skinhead 'puff' mugger, and how the leads, although so intellectually opposite, compliment each other and draw you in with their honesty, and even their morality.Even beautiful, dull Bruges, as a setting, is perfect.For me, it's one of those films that doesn't simply wash over you and rinse off. You absorb it, and are therefore touched by it. Brilliant!",In Bruges
357,gunstar_hero,An Odd Little Movie - by turns Funny and Inarticulate,5,11 April 2009,"Isn't anyone else getting tired of movies that seek to psychoanalyze hit men? From Leon to Collateral, what makes cinema's hired assassins tick has provided mileage for many a screenwriter. The more we are secluded from violence and crime, the more our fictional fascination with hit men and gangsters as agents of retribution and honour has perversely increased. In Bruges, I think, belongs to this trend, allegorizing its ethical concerns through Hieronymus Bosch's famous 15th Century triptych The Last Judgement: a demented vision of damnation which, in the movie's final scenes, spills out onto the screen in the form of a surreal backstreet carnival.The problem with these studies is that film-makers are chasing their own shadow: because cinema created the amoral hit-man, his character has no real-world location, and no portrayal of him will ever be fully convincing.Martin McDonagh's script, for better or worse, barely dips its feet into this psychological subject matter, and Farrell's turpitude is only suggested by his despicable acts of violence. Those aside, he and Gleeson seem like thoroughly likable blokes and serve well as foils to one another. Had the film been an out-an-out comedy, their routine would have worked admirably, but time and time again it oscillates toward a half-baked moral agenda - which only serves to disrupt the tone of the movie. This is yet another film showing how the combination of gangland gore and comedy - perfected in Guy Richie's early work - is so difficult to pull of satisfyingly.In Bruges is, consequently, an odd film that leaves an uneven impression. By no means without laugh-out-loud moments of gallows humour, it retains that penchant for self-deprecation and the absurd characteristic of British comedy. Bruges itself is naturally gorgeous. But nothing ever really rings true; the various themes of the story are not adequately developed, and the script barely scratches the surface of its dysfunctional characters, essentially a gallery of grotesques. It is perhaps fitting that the audience is left in a sort of interpretative limbo - Bosch would certainly have approved.",In Bruges
358,WolfHai,Nihilistic Movie in Bad Taste,1,2 August 2008,"The DVD version of this movie was advertised as a comedy. Maybe the movie should have been advertised as the ""Existential exploration of the lives of English murderers in the early 21st century"". Or as an ""Inquiry into the meaninglessness of life exemplified by three men who commit brutal acts"". A comedy it is not.The movie showed the miserable and pointless lives of three hit men, interspersed with ugly scenes of murder. There were some lame jokes on Bruges and Belgium, which did not get better by overuse. The film was slow, presenting an elegiac, not a comedic tempo. Maybe some people find the display of the internal conflicts of hit men funny. I found it -- at least in this movie -- repulsive and nauseating. At the end of the movie I had a bad taste in my mouth that I wouldn't wish on anybody.The acting and the photography were good. Forget the rest.",In Bruges
359,Icarus_prime,The path to redemption can be both wickedly humorous and depressing,8,13 November 2017,"In Bruges has one of the best cathartic endings I've seen for a movie.It was executed in a way that it changes the entire outlook of the movie's first half where the narrative seemed simple at a surface- level. Yet the emotions will certainly run deep upon viewing it on retrospective.It's deeply admirable that a comedy like this that is often bitingly unapologetic and dark can be fused with the movie's humorous yet tragic examination of a man's inner turmoil, guilt, one's sin and his path to redemption through means of finding his own sanctuary (through ironic terms).",In Bruges

361,p_j_taylor2003,my film of the year so far.,10,20 June 2008,"I'd heard a couple of reviews comparing this to Pulp fiction, and so was eager to see it. Whilst I can see the comparisons they are very different, the only similarities really is that there are 2 hit-man, the dialogue is razor sharp and slightly ambling and are both brilliant pieces of film in their own way. In Bruges is a lot more sedentary. There's no Hollywood gloss in this film, and younger viewers may find it a little slow paced. But the script is funny, the cinematography is wonderful, and ALL the characters are interesting. I loved it when Yuri who thought that ""nooks and crannies"" was a more suitable English word than ""alcoves"". The performances were all as what you can expect from such fine actors as Ralph Fiennes, but I felt that Colin Farrell made the film with the main character Ray. Surely this is an Oscar winning performance and it heightens my belief that anything that Film-4 put their name to is a stamp of excellence. With all that said I'll reserve my only slight criticism of the film till last. I, like some other reviewers found that the end was slightly disappointing. Was it that or was because I simply didn't want the film to end.",In Bruges
362,aadamhgafar-68237,"In Bruges - review, 7/10",7,19 March 2018,"In Bruges was a movie that took it's time to really sink its teeth into me; it began as a slow, chilled-out meander around Bruges (the Belgian town in which the movie is set) that was interspersed with a bit of witty back-and-forth from the two main protagonists (a couple of Irish hitmen preparing to deal with the fallout after a job gone wrong). Whilst the setting of Bruges was interesting in and of itself, I wasn't used to a movie focusing on so little for so long, however, by the time that the stakes were ratcheted up in the second half of the movie I noticed that I had connected with the characters on a level that surprised me. Of course, this was largely down to the excellent cast, the two main characters Ray (played by Colin Farrell) and Ken (played by Brendan Gleeson) have good chemistry and make their flawed characters endearing and relatable. Some credit should also be given to the writers, the cast were given great lines to work with. Admittedly, I found the comedic tone a little strange (especially the weird midget jokes) but it works when it counts and the movie successfully uses humour to explore the inner demons of the hitmen without trivialising their emotions. A more conventional movie would opt out of taking the opportunity to poke fun of its protagonist's emotional turmoil but that's what makes the movie so refreshing; it strikes a balance between humour and thoughtfulness and gets it (mostly) right, adding a breath of fresh air to an already pretty unique movie. I say mostly as the plot gets more and more ridiculous as it goes on, events start of quite tame but soon Bruges opens up as it's unconvincing locals introduce themselves and devolve into unconvincing plot devices, it was good for a few good laughs but felt very lazy and pulled me out of the movie.Saying that, I still enjoyed the film, the cast did a good job of holding the movie up as the plot began to thin near the climax. Overall, the entire 'feel' of In Bruges is very... unconventional and while it is lacking in areas, it's setting, characters and humour are still a welcome step back from typical Hollywood blockbusters.",In Bruges

Brendan Gleason is old and wise, as well as more mature than his partner. he is calm through most of the movie and not bothered by their situation. Colin Farrell on the other hand is messed up, and seeks to get out of bruges. many could relate to him being the annoying traveller of the group.the story starts out slow, but by the end you will not feel ripped off. Colin Farrell is a young hit-man, who has just been on his first hit. not too spoil things, but things don't go too well. so he is sent away to bruges with another hit-man to look after him (Brendan Gleason). however things seem to escalate, getting even worse. the two of them try to keep a low profile, but end up giving up. Colin Farrell gets involved with a girl, meets a midget who's making a movie, etc. Brendan Gleason however gets another assignment from his boss (Ralph Fiens) and is torn between loyalties.this movie is fantastic and for the first half of the movie will keep you laughing. however it gets much darker towards the end. this movie has a few scenes of violence, most of which are quite disturbing. but despite the dark themes, you can always expect great dialogue between Colin and Brendan.Ralph Fiens is great as a mean guy with a cockney accent. he and the other two main cast members also overcome each of their individual problems in a surprising way.this movie is very funny and very intriguing with three great actors. i would recommend it to fans of guy Ritchie or Quentin Tarantino. but in my opinion i found this movie deeper than most of their movies.",In Bruges
365,niezone,They didn't know how to end it,7,25 August 2009,"In Bruges successfully blends comedy, drama and some action with very powerful performances by Colin Farrel, Ralph Fiennes and, most of all, Brendan Gleeson. Most interestingly, In Bruges appears common and accessible at times, but when everything seems predictable, we are thrown a curve-ball that gives the movie a certain edge and an ever present blanket of dark comedy that permeates all characters, most especially Ray, played by Colin F. Bruges, a medieval city in Belgium, is presented to us as a blend of old and new. Its locals and its buildings set the background, while the characters upfront stand out like sore thumbs within a ""fairy tale"" place as it is often described. Hidden within the comedy is a very dramatic script that deals with feelings of regret, suicide, murder and love but that never seems burdensome or hard to watch. Especially important to the development of the story is the character of Brendan Gleeson who has come to Bruges not knowing it will be a crucial moment in his life, a setting that will allow him to reevaluate his values and make decisions that go against all that he has done in the past. Ken seeks for redemption, even when he knows he is already condemned and we see the interesting transformation on the screen. Despite its crafty mix of comedy and drama, In Bruges falls short as it delivers an ending that over-relies in unnecessary action and unsubstantial dialogue. It is the typical case of a story that needs to end but does not know how. There is no better example of this that the final scene and the predictable cyclical ending we are given.",In Bruges

It has many superlative elements, and one flaw.The story is compelling, and laden with themes. The use of Brugge as purgatory, is encapsulated in the scene where Ray and Ken meditate upon The Last Judgement, by Bosch. The theme that nice men can do bad things recurs. A nod (an homage is too strong) to ""Don't Look Now"", and another nod to ""Nosferatu the Vampyre"", as Harry, in silhouette, pistol whips the attendant of the Brugge Belfry. Ken's own redemption, attempting to redeem Ray shows that it's never too late to change the path you have chosen. Harry, also a bad man, remains an honourable man- ""You've got to stick to your principles""; ""I'm sorry I called you an inanimate object"". The ultimate revelation that the midget's role is central, and is not a picaresque conceit, is masterly. The brilliant dialogue, and the haunting score, especially, Der Leiermann, illustrate that Carter Burwell really understood the film, and endow the film with a congruence that is all too rare.The flaw? That self referential bit when Harry tells Marie that ""this is the shoot out"". It jars, but it's like grit in an oyster, emphasising the overall brilliance of this film.",In Bruges

Add to that a great balance of thriller and dark comedy and this could be the Snatch of 2008. Negatives? I guess not seeing Ralph Fiennes till midway through the movie - yes he was on the telephone with Brendan Gleeson's character earlier in the film but Fiennes' acting at his best has to be seen and he was definitely pretty good when he was on the screen. But all in all, a superb film definitely worth watching and definitely worth getting out on DVD eventually.",In Bruges

If there's a line that perfectly sums up In Bruges it's the above.Offensive, emotional, hilarious and brilliant would also be good individual words..This film is by far one of the best this year.For me it ranked up and around No Country For Old Men.Please God let Martin McDonagh make more movies (preferabley with Brendan Gleeson again).For those who worry about Colin Farrell's comic timing, WORRY NOT!He's spot on, complimenting the immense Gleeson and Fiennes brilliantly.Fiennes is clearly in his element playing against type as a hard as nails cocky gangster who could be in the nest Guy Ritchie movie.The film's strength is in it's ability to have you laughing one minute and crying the next.Martin McDonagh knows how to write, we all know that.On the path from stage to screen he has used his unique manipulation of the English language to prove his worth time and time again.As well as being an accomplished writer he's also a bloody Academy Award winner!! I saw this the day it was released in Ireland in a less than half full screen in the middle of the day and everyone of us was laughing away together in a shared experience of what will no doubt be a classic, Irish roller-coaster ride of a film.(Christ, I even wanted to go to Bruges by the end of it..)",In Bruges

374,kainaw,"For such a beautiful city, there isn't much to see",4,6 July 2008,"The fault of this movie rests entirely on the script. There is a reason that movies are usually written by one person and directed by another. The collaboration tends to heal the weaknesses that each side brings to the project. ""In Brugges"" was made without collaboration. The acting is great. The cinematography is great. The soundtrack (what there is of it) is great. The story is just written and directed in such a amateurish manner that the experience becomes an hour long wait for the ""big finish"" that is spelled out so completely in the overdone foreshadowing that all surprise and excitement is lost. Think of it as going out for dinner on your birthday and being told on the way that it is a surprise party, then being told who will be there, and finally being told exactly what present each person bought for you -- all before you even open the door to hear SURPRISE!

Bored, after the initial sight-seeing device wears thin, the duo together, and separately, take some wild rides with a carnival of far-fetched, quirk-laden characters: a supermodel apparition-cum-reality slut, a coked-up racist dwarf, a Housemother-Mary in her third trimester, bi-polar drug-dealers, etc. It's as though the writer of this mess believes that comedy requires caricature, great dialog can only be comprised of four-letter words, and modern storytelling means stringing together 100+ minutes of fun-house non sequiturs in order to keep an audience on its toes. Colin Farrel puts in his worst performance to date: indicating, forcing, and making faces to get his motivations across. Obviously the director is influenced by the Tarantino school of film-making, but sadly he missed the class on thematic points and the protagonist's journey, focusing on the flashy, outrageous, and cartoon-like aspects of recess. The writer/director claims he got the idea when he, himself, visited Bruges-- he found the city so ""Gothic and beautiful,"" but then how bored he was after only two days, and how he started to want to ""find a girl and get drunk,"" etc. Isn't that inspiring? To think that someone's boredom can become the main plot line of a movie. The oft repeated central question of the movie seems to be ""Why are we in Bruges?"" Why indeed?

And it deserves it. It's a very, very, VERY good film, no doubt.From what I understand, this is Martin McDonagh's first full-length film. All I have to say is this... congratulations, man! It is truly a great film! Very nice direction, and the characters of Ray and Ken are excellently portrayed and acted by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson. And every other characters on the sidelines are quite good as well, they make their appearance, their meaning and their resolution quite nicely. Hmmm... this is a sign of a good director/writer who knows how to tell a story! I hope to see more films by this guy, I really do. I'm a wannabe filmmaker myself, and it makes me happy to see a new director come along and make a good movie! Oh yeah, you won an Oscar for Best Short film back in '04, didn't you? I haven't seen your short, but that's an awesome achievement. Maybe you can win another Oscar someday. Although, maybe winning an Oscar isn't the greatest achievement for some people, but I think it's a nice honor. After all, your film ""In Bruges"" made it on IMDb's Top 250! Now that is something to really be proud of! And I certainly will keep the film in my DVD collection for a long time!Bravo!The movie is suspenseful, it's emotional, it's intriguing, it's a little funny, it's memorable, and it's watchable. Not only all that, but it's nicely well-told and it has some depth, though not perfect. Well done, Martin McDonagh!

377,ced650,"Excellent, Brilliant, Wonderful",10,10 March 2010,"Voila, as adjectives (and I probably forgot) to describe this trip to Bruges. For even if this is not the first time it shows us that the killers are not only machines but also have feelings, here the angle chosen to tell the story of these two killers out completely because of the ordinary. Indeed, already begin interpreting the duo Ray (Colin Farrell) / Ken (Brendan Gleeson) works well and both players have very good chemistry, as is also too rare. And what is cast, the supporting actors are all so well written and not allow for accounts (such as Jimmy (Jordan Prentice) who has a key role in the denouement of the plot), in fact each character is here to advance the story, no one is left behind at the plot or set listed regarding dialogs tasty (Ralph Fiennes and his foul language is an important effect on this) The relationship between Ray and Ken, to return to the duo gave me the impression of a father / son. And it is felt more gradually as the plot or advance, Ken knew very well ""evil"" that eats Ray wants this trip to change his ideas to start and then eventually the cure of that evil in his own risk, as a father to his son. A city of fairy tale to include Ralph Fiennes in a moment of the film with this story of impossible love between Ray and Chloe, with her hero (Ken) loan has defied any danger to nothing happens to his protégé (Ray), and this gallery of colorful characters have said that this city was ideal because it is indeed a modern fairy tale that we are witnessing. I would add that sometimes it is very difficult to keep from shedding a tear.",In Bruges
378,ceche,A subtle film for intellectual openness.,9,10 October 2009,"Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) are hit men. Their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes), instructs them to travel to Bruges and await further instructions while hiding out in the medieval town, since Ray has made a terrible, life-changing mistake on the job. ""In Bruges"" is listed virtually everywhere as ""comedy"", but a slightly-more-than-superficial viewer might have something to say about that. In fact, the film is actually a complex fresco of slapstick comedy, intense mob drama, Gothic phantasmagoria and, to top it all off, grotesque extravaganza. What makes this film so unique and superb is an (apparently) unlikely combination of genres in one unfathomable, original, hilarious and outrageous script, wrongfully devoid of an Oscar. Most of the time you forget that Ken and Ray are Irish mobsters rather accidental tourists and Farrell plus Gleeson plus Fiennes equals comedic virtuosity. Colin Farrell graces us with the best performance of his entire career, full of immeasurable depth and versatility, while Brendan Gleeson watches over him with paternal warmth and veteran excellence. Ralph Fiennes rounds out the main cast as a foul-mouthed, shamefully funny and overly memorable mob-boss, thus proving his exquisite range as an actor. There is one member of the cast who is not mentioned as such, but nevertheless acquires fundamental importance: that is, of course, the town of Bruges, exuding its ancient history from every inch of the screen and wrapped in Eigil Bryld's marvellous cinematography, which gives it an aura of mysticism and mystery seldom achieved in films. Carter Burwell's full-bodied and profound score underlines the dramatic aspects of the story, which crawl almost unnoticed during the first part of the film only to explode with violent and bloody vigour in the second one and culminate into a suspenseful finale. Overall, this subtle operation is not a dish for the weak-hearted or the intellectually obtuse, as it conjures up an emotional journey which requires full involvement, suspension of disbelief and, most importantly, intellectual openness, a trait rarely found in contemporary audiences.",In Bruges

I refer not to some huge pile of copies of the shabby magazine the UK homeless use to fund their narcotic predilections, but to the weighty literary themes: death, love, honour, friendship, sacrifice and (possibly) redemption.All this wrapped in a shroud of the darkest black humour, and topped with a comedy bad guy. Comedy baddest guy, actually, because all the main speaking parts in this movie, except for one, are ""bad guys"" when measured by the traditional moral yardstick. We have hit men, drug dealers, petty thieves, prostitutes and casual racist ""midgets"", all in the undeniably picturesque setting of Bruges... it's in Belgium.Colin Farrell, who I had previously thought to have the killer combination of good looks and bad acting, delivers an excellent comedic performance with impeccable timing. But it is Brendan Gleeson as his friend and partner in crime who steals the show. Ralph Fiennes steps out of typecast to deliver a chillingly surreal yet down-to-earth cock-er-ney gangster in a Will Self plays Bill Sykes manner.Other comments and the forums ask ""how did it end"".

The beginning seems to start slow but with the purpose of gradually humanizing the cuh arch tees and there inner struggles and multi-faceted personality traits. As the film go's on there are more characters introduced and the puzzle pieces begin to start to connect in the most fantastical and brilliantly connected ways. This film represents inner struggle within the main character as well as principles for all the characters and it all stems from the one action of killing a little boy. It culminates in a twisting, heroic, and tragic ending that is both sad but still satisfying and unique. This movie has so much depth within the characters and there actions but not in a way that makes it confusing or abstract for the viewer. Rather in a way that makes for an action filled and emotional ending to a sad, funny, and emotionally and visually enthralling piece of cinema. Truly a marvel and crafted in a way that will surely leave most viewers glad they were able to experience such a distinctly crafted story and characters. Must watch!!",In Bruges

Yes, it's difficult to pick a favorite from each genre even, let alone mix and match genre's an pick an ultimate winner from the whole pile.But I did say ""if a gun were put to my head"".. and a gun could be put to my head.. anytime, anywhere, sitting on a park bench in a children's playground even?Of all the movies I've seen (and I've seen lots in 50 plus years), this is the leanest. No fleshing out, no padding, every frame has a purpose, every word uttered has a meaning. I've viewed quite a few of my favorite movies more than once, and on repeated viewings there's always a scene or a line of dialogue I notice which could have been better, or omitted even. But not here, and I've seen this movie A LOT!I've read a review where the reviewer accuses the movie of being homophobic? RUBBISH! This movie treats everyone equally...Everyone get's hammered. Irish, English, Belgian, Dutch, American, Canadian, Homosexuals, Prostitutes, Hit-men, Midgets....EVERYONE! And if you treat everyone equally how can you be accused of being biased?Gleeson is perfection as always (could he be otherwise?), ditto Fiennes, but the one who pulled out all the stops and was brilliant throughout was Colin Farrell. I simply didn't think he had a performance as good as this in him... I was wrong.When I saw this movie initially, I thought to myself ""Martin McDonagh, you're in deep s**t"". I mean, how can he follow that up? Whatever comes next is bound to be inferior. And I was proved right.He should have just packed his bags, found a cave somewhere and became a hermit, because following In Bruges was going to prove impossible. Funnily enough, his brother had the same problem, following on from the excellent (but not in this league!) ""The Guard"" with that horrific mess that was ""Calvary"". So why is that? That ""2nd album"" syndrome? I have a theory... it's time. On the first film, they have loads of time.. time to write, rewrite, check and re-check, add bits, throw out bits over months, maybe years, until it's perfect (in their eyes at least). But then it comes out, and... and another idea has to be found, and a script, and the studio is putting pressure on, so corners are cut, and scripts aren't redrafted as they needed to be, and ..... and that's my theory anyway.But that's beside the point.

It's the kind of lousy movie that seems to have been inspired by rednecks and writing on toilet walls in pubs.Reading some of the reviews of this film is mind boggling. Most harp on and on about Farrell's redemption but given that this particular element in the script is so utterly unconvincing (Is this what McDonaugh considers irony?) and simply used as a device to validate Farrell's rampant homophobia and misogyny-the result is sickening, not illuminating.Yes, Bruges looks wonderful but who cares when you're watching offensive rubbish of this nature.

388,bozinovska_jovana,Not a big deal,6,22 July 2013,"I'm going to start with the good things about this movie. 1)The great crew of actors and their well done acting. We have Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes who was the best of them all. He appeared the least but did a hell of a job. But, that doesn't mean the others failed, all of them made this movie good. And this is one of the reasons I enjoyed it. 2)The place. The title says it. In Bruges. I don't know if that is where the movie is really shot, but still it is a beautiful small town and we get a chance to see it in more than one scene. 3)The story and the twist. Colin's character(Ray) is a hit-man and comes in Bruges with Brendan's character(Ken), because he accidentally killed a little boy. What they don't know, is that Ralph's character(Harry) sent them there, so that Ray could have nice time before Ken killed him. But, of course that is not so simple. In the end, Harry has to come and do the job himself and he ends up having the same faith as Ray, expect he didn't kill a little boy, but a dwarf and he doesn't realize that.The things that didn't make this movie awesome: 1)It was quite slow,quiet and at moments boring. The only action we see is in the last 10 minutes. But, if you like interesting dialog, it should be OK. 2)When I searched it here at IMDb, they tagged it as a comedy first. It definitely isn't. It has very,very little humor if you know to recognize it because the characters aren't even trying to be funny, and funnily enough, that's the funny. 3)Almost all the three main characters die.I didn't like that. I usually connect with the characters and I don't want them to die, but sometimes I accept a tragic end if it will make the movie great. And maybe it does for this one. Any way, if you don't mind if the lead actors die, then you should enjoy it.",In Bruges
389,cronindaniel,A Truly Dark Comedy,10,29 September 2016,"When you think of a dark comedy you generally associate it with dark humor. However, in the case of In Bruges, it is the story and themes that are dark with the humor used as levity, unlike others which use it simply to get a laugh out of their film, the comedy in In Bruges serves a purpose.In terms of acting this movie is top-notch with all actors at the top of their game, namely Colin Farrell as Ray, Brandon Gleeson as Ken, and Ralph Fiennes as Harry. Every actor absolutely nails their roles and give truly convincing performances. On top of that, every character is multi-layered and interesting in their own unique way, Ray could've just been a mentally unstable whiny guy who didn't want to be in Bruges, but he was also a guilt-ridden suicide case who doesn't know if life is truly worth living anymore. Ken could've been just another old mentor figure, but he was also a conflicted man being forced to decide between what is right and wrong. Harry could've been just an easily- enraged menacing villain, but he was also an incredibly honor-driven man and a clearly loving father (to a certain extent). Even the side characters all add their own unique likability to the film. Huge props to this film for knowing how to create truly interesting and likable characters.Now that that's out of the way, let's get to what truly makes this film great: the themes explored in the dialogue. Despite technically being a comedy, like The Truman Show, this film is so much more than just something to laugh at. Themes explored include guilt, depression, suicide, death, morality, and even the meaning of life. This movie somehow manages to seamlessly blend all of these themes into it's narrative using the oldest trick in the book when it comes to exploring themes: dialogue. This movie has amazing dialogue between it's characters and truly makes them feel like real people by having them swear, use slang, and occasionally joke while discussing the themes mentioned above. A round of applause for Martin McDonagh, who wrote and directed the film and truly breathed life into his work.So to summarize, In Bruges is an absolutely incredible movie with interesting themes, fantastic performances, and very good direction. It's refreshing to see such a well made comedy which knows that humor alone is not what makes a movie great. Despite it's somewhat underrated status I consider this film to be a must-watch for anyone and everyone.The End",In Bruges
390,elfinadrawer,shoot the director,8,18 February 2008,"Well, this film had some great actors and a wonderful setting. It also pointed towards some redemption. But alas, the director/producer/script writer decided to appease the American type audience by 1. using some extremely graphic and violent shots of people being murdered, again and again; 2. attempting to make murder and murderous types humorous; 3. and the list goes on. Its a bit of a combination of ""The Third Man"" with ""Pulp Fiction"", but without the cynicism of the former or the dance sequence of the latter. In other words, it had no redeeming qualities. Since there's only about three murders in Europe in a year, the chances of this happening are slim to ill. I know it is cool to have hit men be intelligent and sympathetic, but in real life such thugs are slimy psychopaths with the moral interests of a snail. The film also threw in a midget, and killed him off too just to make one last point, which was that the whole film was a contrived piece of garbage. It could have been good if they had eliminated Bruges, murder, hit men, etc., but hen, that would have forced the film makers to provide some depth, realism, and humanity.

396,bobbybillions,I found myself laughing when I shouldn't have been.,10,27 June 2008,"To put it succinctly, In Bruges was the best film that I saw in 2007. I loved every minute of it, from the expletives in the opening scene to the shockingly crazy ending. Colin Farrell plays a hit-man recruited by Brendan Gleeson to work for Ralph Fiennes. When Farrell botches his first job, Fiennes sends both him and Gleeson to Bruges, Belgium, to get them away from London.Colin Farrell was disastrous in Alexander, largely because the film was a catastrophe, so watching him in In Bruges was a real surprise, he is excellent. He fits the character so well, the mannerisms, emotions, everything. His interactions with Gleeson during their escapades throughout the medieval town of Bruges are examples of perfect cinematography, excellent scripts, and superb sounds. The score complements the film in every way, fitting both the scenery and the film.However, if you are easily offended or unable to deal with violent scenes you probably do not want to watch this film. Violence, coarse language, and other ""antisocial"" tendencies are pervasive throughout the film as they form the core of the movie.

It is treated as a comedy and was even nominated as a comedy, but its not a comedy or a dark comedy. Not through the wording nor through the actions. The acting is good, Colin Farrell's performance is good, but having few facial expressions mimicking Johhny Depp or Heath Ledger are not enough to grant a Golden Globe, so the acting is overrated also. In overall, an overrated film on all aspects, i have no clue why it is 8.1, but it is a good flick that you can enjoy if you know what you are going into.

Maybe it was Ken's devotion toward this boy who made a bad call but had the rest of his life to make up for it, or the casual conversations between two killers with honor who respected each other but had to stay true to their principles. There was certainly a lot of scenes I will not forget anytime soon. Colin portrayed the naivety of his character quite convincingly and made an usually unlikable person quite fun to watch.

I loved storyline, performance of the cast and Bruges of course:) Farrell was funny and charismatic all the time. Farrell was so sweet as he was expressing that he hates Bruges:) He was very attractive with glasses. He had a role just like he had in Woody Allen's ""Cassandra's dream"": a man who regrets what he did and is therefore depressed. I believe he succeeded in playing this role in both movies. Bruges was the right choice as city. I couldn't decide if the city was more attractive or Farrell. The beautiful homes and buildings, peaceful roads and magnificent canals of this historical city affected me. Storyline was very good: two hit men come to Bruges to lie low after botched job. They stay in such a warm hotel. They discover the city. One of them is ordered to do sth he doesn't want to. Farrell finds love in this magical city.",In Bruges
401,sr3500,"Grim, Humorous, and Sense-Satisfying",8,21 April 2011,"It seems odd to start with a film's score, but the impact that Carter Burwell's work has on this film should not go unnoticed. His scoring creates a mood throughout that, to paraphrase from the film, puts the film somewhere between reality and a dream, much of the time - it's that good. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant, and is reminiscent of Kingsley in ""Sexy Beast"" - brutally principled, and seemingly, perpetually angry. Brendan Gleeson also contributes a strong performance. I was prepared to not like Farrell, but in reality, he strikes a good balance between lackadaisical thuggery and poignant vulnerability...I tried to think of who might've done better in the role, actors like Ewan McGregor, for instance, but actually, I couldn't think of any (Ewan included). The movie itself strikes that same balance that Farrell's character does. The relatively few scenes of violence are bloody, blunt, and realistic. There are some very funny moments, and humor drifts throughout. In pubs and plazas, Bruges is charmingly Old World - the film is as appealing to the eye as the score is to the ear. Matters of awful gravity, like the killing of children and violence against women, somehow don't drag the film down to an unenjoyable depth. The film stirs thoughts of situational ethics, and that there, compelling the viewer to consider what one believes, makes it a worthy watch. The preciousness and corrigibility of youth, and the sacred status of the expecting mother, juxtaposed with mercenary violence - well done.",In Bruges

404,nellyd23,Being stuck in the cinema with this film was like being stranded in Bruges.,4,8 May 2008,"Where to start with this film? In Bruges is a strange little film, combining, as it does, comedy and violence. There is much to like about this film, but a lot more dislike. Colin Farrell is excellent as the guilt ridden hit-man Ray. Much of the dialogue with his partner Ken, played by Brendan Gleeson, is smart and funny and the premise of two hit men stranded in random place has potential. I particularly liked the economy of Ray's opening voice-over that sets the scene for the film. On reflection the things I like about this film are the things that the writer / director Martin McDonagh may have brought from his theatrical background. What I disliked about this film (SPOILER COMING) is what McDonagh does with the film's story that grows ever more preposterous and unbelievable as the movie goes on. What really starts to grate is the reliance on coincidence to drive the narrative and how the director simply brings characters together without explanation. A case in point would be Chloey's psycho boyfriend being present in a scene where Yuri, the (Russian?) gun dealer sells Harry a gun. What is the boyfriend doing here? And low and behold as the movie drifts towards its climax he appears again, quite randomly, to assist Harry in tracking down Ken with the line that goes something like, ""he went that a way!"" It is desperate stuff and totally unbelievable. And there are many more moments like this. Towards the end they meet Jimmy the dwarf walking to work on a film set already in costume. Jimmy is playing a school boy and so him being in costume allows another totally absurd plot twist to develop. As a film maker McDonagh should know that actors don't walk to work and they certainly don't turn up already in costume. And finally McDonagh's use of cinematic violence is particularly infuriating and rather than recommend Tarantino to McDonagh, to show how it should be done, I would tell him to see Funny Games instead. The violence that McDonagh uses to get a laugh and tell the story is movie violence. It is violence without consequence and pain, the sort that Hollywood has been peddling since day one. But then again perhaps I should have seen it coming....a movie about hit men? Thats bound to lead to gun dealer called Yuri living in a big eccentric house and a beautiful drug dealer /stick up artist living in a gorgeous apartment. Where people pick up and point guns without checking to see if they are loaded - or where you can buy a gun without actually handing over the money. This is the world of movie violence where a woman being punched in the face raises a laugh and where a hit mans first job is to kill a priest. It is totally stupid and, more unforgivably, quite boring. Mr McDonagh, Hollywood awaits.",In Bruges
405,popcorncharlie,Cracking!,7,23 February 2008,"Great film! I watched this in a packed movie theater in the USA, and although parts of the dialogue are a bit ""near the mark"" for the American audience, and certain jokes are aimed squarely at the British / Irish audience, it went down very well.A very original take on a good story, all performances were excellent. The script can seem a little cheesy at first, but once it gets flowing it's very natural and very well written, and performed seamlessly.Colin is excellent, probably his best role I would say! The only slight negative is that 'Arry, Ralph Fiennes' character, is rather too similar to Don Logan, Ben Kingsley's character in Sexy Beast. However, this isn't a bad thing as both characters work well, it's just a shame I couldn't stop myself comparing them.My wife and I really enjoyed, it's very, very funny throughout, with moments of real subtle, dry comedy genius, plus moments of in your face humour. It's also bittersweet, romantic, violent, briefly offensive to some, occasionally shocking and upsetting, but hugely enjoyable and very well done.Overall a very strong 9 / 10 for a great independent movie!

406,Midsomerlover,Blockbuster from Bruges....,8,20 June 2008,"""In Bruges"". When the title first struck our ears, I couldn't believe it. They were gonna film a British movie in my home town? I was astonished. Who would want to film a movie in our little city? Martin McDonagh, it seemed. We were all so very excited. It was very rare for a Flemish city to be picked as a location for a blockbuster movie.My work was in the hart of the city so I passed the set almost every day and I even did some extra work on it. By then we had also heard that Colin Farrel, Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes would be in it and we were all thrilled to welcome them. Girls from local schools were saying they got Colin's phone number, girls who said they had a drink with Colin and he tried to seduce them, saying they'd met Brendan and Ralph in the street... it was everyday talk. I didn't believe much of it until I met them myself. They were just about to film the outside scene at the Belfry tower, and as I passed I just waved and... Brendan and Ralph waved back. Me and my stupid head went to them and asked ""How's filming' going?"" and to my utter amazement they just answered politely ""Very well thanks, although it is rather cold"".I recently saw the full version of the film and it is great to see how good it was. They really did a great job on making Bruges look enchanting, but in fact it always does. I think that they didn't have a lot of work to 'make' it beautiful. It already is. The script was great and the casting sublime. If you haven't seen it yet, go out to the cinema or buy the DVD. You won't regret. Not after you've seen our wonderful city and the splendid acting performances.",In Bruges

I didn't have high expectations since I hadn't heard much about it, and I'm not a huge fan of Colin Farrell, but I'm pleased to say that I was blown away by this dark, witty black comedy.I was laughing within 5 minutes of the film starting, and the laughs continued from there. Somehow Farrell manages to make his assassin Ray both likable and amusing, and the bond between the two hit men is touching without being sickly sweet.Basically, this film has it all: comedy, drama, action, thrills and a hint of romance.I would highly recommend seeing it, you won't regret it! Although I would warn people of a sensitive nature that it's possibly the most politically incorrect film I've ever seen (alongside Death at a Funeral, which happens to be one of the worst films I've ever seen!).

Ken and Ray are two hit men sent to Bruges (its in Belgium, you know) to hide out after a contract Ray carried out went bad. It is difficult to adequately summarise the plot without giving too much away, so I won't bother. But guns, humor, emotion and a great set of characters give rise to an excellent film.

409,JAllen60,One of the funniest--and best--movies ever produced,10,3 January 2015,"In Bruges is an extraordinarily clever dark comedy about conflicted Irish hit-men cooling their heels, well, in Bruges. The plot twists and turns as crazily but purposefully as the streets of the medieval city in which it is set. The acting is spot on throughout--the actors clearly enjoying the jokes--and in several scenes the writer/director manages to draw breathtakingly exquisite comedy from the most apparently serious conversations. If you're going to kill a man in an alcove, you want to know you're using the right word, after all. This is actually one of the best movies ever made, and represents a signal achievement. Odd that it didn't get more recognition than it did, but its subject matter and strange humor may have just been too taut to allow comparisons with 2001 or The Godfather. It's not quite as good as the former (though almost), and a lot better than the latter. Puts Citizen Kane in the shade, which is like spending three hours, well, in Bruges.",In Bruges
410,Mike_Offerosky,In Bruges,10,3 April 2009,"In Bruges balances black comedy on a razor wire. It's the kind of movie that makes you sit up and take notice. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are hit men hiding out in Bruges (it's in Belgium) while awaiting on further instruction. Gleeson, the more experienced hit man, wants to take in the sights. Farrell, the novice hit man, just wants to get drunk. Gleeson is at home in Bruges while Farrell is bored out of his wits. Luckily, they stumble upon a movie set that is shooting and meet some eccentrics. They meet the sets drug dealer and a dwarf (Jordan Prentice, who's wonderful) being used for a fantasy sequence. That distraction takes Farrell's mind of his torment. You see he just completed his first job as a hit man and botched it. He made the hit but a child got killed in the process. This is just eating Farrell up inside. In the meantime, the boss calls and Gleeson gets the call, he has to kill Farrell. The boss makes it clear that its unacceptable that a child got killed accidental or not. In a very funny, tense scene, Gleeson is sneaking up on Farrell sitting on a park bench getting ready to kill him only as he gets closer find out Farrell is about to kill himself. So Gleeson stops him from offing himself and sends him on a train so that he wouldn't be found. Gleeson calls the boss tells him that he wasn't going to do it and that he just sent him on a train to god knows where. The boss (played by Ralph Fiennes, who does much with his little screen time) decides to take things in his own hands and go to Bruges himself. All of this builds to a suspenseful and frantic conclusion . You just might find In Bruges well worth a return visit.",In Bruges
411,b_evans,Terrible movie trying to be sentimental and funny,2,17 April 2010,"""In Bruges"" apparently has some sort of fan base going on, with reviews on this site saying it might be the greatest movie of the decade. All I can say is that standards for movies are at an all time low. I will try my best to avoid giving spoilers for this movie. Basically about hit men in hiding, contemplating about their chosen profession, In Bruges seems like it should have a darker tone for a movie. Unfortunately, the result is a mix between some weird, heavy drama, and some terrible lines that aren't funny. We have the more sophisticated guy obviously paired with the younger retarded guy who botches his first job and feels the urge to yell whenever he's joking just in case you missed it, because the jokes in this movie are pretty bad. Add in some obscene language and it's all hilarious right? The only way this movie is entertaining is if you don't care about the plot and like midget jokes, but even then, the movie keeps throwing on a more serious tone that contrasts pretty terribly with the whole premise of the film and the comedic sections. Basically, In Bruges is a failure because it doesn't stick to any particular style and in so doing messes both of them up.",In Bruges
412,John_the_Lamp,"'In Bruges' takes its time, but when it gets there, the payoff is beyond expectations",8,14 August 2012,"'In Bruges' is the unlikely comedic drama that centers around two hit-men arriving in Bruges, Belgium. One hit-man, Ray (Farrell), is more for the party places and having a good time which means he isn't enjoying his time in Bruges. The other, Ken (Gleeson), really enjoys Bruges, and urges Ray to follow their bosses orders and lay low until they're told otherwise. But the story doesn't exactly kick into gear until Harry (Fiennes) comes to town. And explaining why he kicks it into gear would be giving too much away.So if you know me, you know that I'm not the biggest Colin Farrell fan. He hasn't impressed me, until now. He was very surprising. At first, I thought he was doing his typical Farrell thing, where he looks completely out of place regardless of where he is. But after 20 seconds, I really thought he did his job well. Not only did I enjoy his performance, but I am now looking forward to his performance in 'Seven Psychopaths'. As for the other leads in this movie, Gleeson and Fiennes, they both killed it for me. This makes me want to see 'The Guard' just for Gleeson's performance. And Fiennes, as always, just knocks every single line out of the park. Even in the simplest of dialogue, he made it seem so much more real. The man can act.And the one thing I had heard more than anything, was how surprisingly funny it is. And it kind of was, I mean I wasn't nearly peeing my pants or anything, but it was funny at times. But that totally blinded me for what I found even more surprising: the drama. These characters, Ray especially, were really deep and you could even sympathize with him. I found myself nearly cheering for the characters. There were also a surprising amount of moments where it was borderline sad. That was one thing I wasn't expecting from this kind of film, which means that when it pulled it off, it takes it up a couple of pegs. And yes, as you can see from the headline, I wasn't ""in love"" with this movie for the first 30-45. That's the time where it's just Gleeson and Farrell sight-seeing. There was some witty dialogue, but I thought that it would kick it into gear a little faster. I know it had to set up both its characters and story lines, but I can't help but complain that it was too slow in the early going of the movie. There were even some things that had nothing to do with the story at all. Farrell's love interest, despite being extremely hot, had no real point of being there. There was also the weird 2 minute spark between Gleeson and the co-owner of the hotel. But before you think that I didn't enjoy this movie, allow to talk about the last hour or so. I can't talk specifics because that would give too much away for a film that really relies on being able to take the story anywhere. But to give you a taste, this is where Fiennes finally appears (despite being mentioned and hearing his voice, he doesn't appear until the latter part). And as I said before, Fiennes really does knock it out of the park, which helps the second half of the film immensely. The intensity is pumped up, the real conflict isn't actually apparent until pretty late in the movie. But it all works and the film delivers one of the greatest third acts I've ever seen in a movie. Knowing that Martin McDonagh was playwrite before this big screen debut makes sense now, because there were parts where I thought, Man this feels like a play. But in conclusion, 'In Bruges' is a promising good time with a surprising amount of heartfelt moments. You won't be disappointed with this debut. {B+}",In Bruges
413,robert-w-andrews,Once your in Bruges you'll never want to leave.,10,7 October 2012,"Centered in the small and unappealing town of Bruges in Belgium, this very British based production achieves Hollywood perfection. Redefining the ability to cross cut two differing genres, In Bruges is a comical yet tense work that stands superior to any past production piece regardless of its genre, in which a deep feeling of envy should be felt.Employing a narrative that does not stretch any further than being simple yet engaging, it is a story that features both deep sorrow and realistic humour. As two hit men Ray and Ken exile to Bruges after a hit goes terribly wrong, it focuses on the morals and trauma surrounding the pairs past killings as they engage with the historical beauty of Bruges and the alternate lifestyle it offers. The director Martin McDonagh is vigilante not to glorify the pairs criminal career in any way, which is essential to the realistic factor the film employs, as there is a deep focus on the aftermath and trauma of both their failures and lack of mercy for their victims. The plot from early on is fairly engaging, but it is the truly unsuspecting plot twist that engages the viewer further into the the tension that begins to climatically build from that point. Regardless of the change of attitudes and tipping balance of genre focus that switches between comedy to drama at various points, the comical and emotion provoking actions that the characters commit provide a narrative that is not only unique but surprisingly enjoyable.With a strong focus on a shrewd use of comedy throughout, ""In Bruges"" provides the viewers with an extensive collection of memorable scenes due to the many comical moments and factors that account for the films comedy based success. Being dominated by a fairly broad range of foul mouthed arguments often ending in violence, the more significant comedy factor is present within the difference in ideology and interests between Ray and Ken. With the pairs similarities stretching no further than their corrupt career path, the pair often resemble the powerless father and brat like child relationship in the early aspects of the plot. Yet it is the lack of belonging the pair experience in the somewhat unideal town of Bruges that provide the most credible element of amusement throughout, as two Irish hit men in a small Belgium town is unsurprisingly unideal, as their actions from early on indicate.Incorporating a fairly small yet diverse range of characters, the casting follows other aspects of the films success in being impeccable. With Colin Farrell heading the cast as the guilt stricken hit-man Ray, his performance of a far from stable individual with a lack of enthusiasm for his partners historical interests or Bruges itself is of the highest caliber. Farrell's revival of his often disregarded Irish accent is highly approved of, as it certainly emphasizes the comedy within his dialogue and is obviously an essential factor for the characters portrayal. Brendan Gleeson shares not only the strong Irish accent employed by Farrell, but equals the high standard of his performance. Gleeson's portrayal of the culture loving hit-man Ken tends to be so genuine that his characters career choice tends to seem hard to believe, which is far from a criticism considering his characters purpose is to blend in with the law abiding citizens of Bruges. Ralph Fiennes on the other hand is a far more clouded character for the most part as Ken and Ray's boss Harry. Displaying the ruthlessness not present within the exiled pair of hit men, Fiennes' performances as yet another villain is just as flawless in comparison to his contributions in past productions and his casting colleagues in this one.Where as the visual factors of ""In Bruges"" are immaculate, its relevant soundtrack deserves the same credit. With a primarily piano based soundtrack it is not only suitable for the location of the film, but also adds to the sense of foreboding which ensures the comical factor disappears in the more serious sequences of the films narrative. Without this imperial soundtrack the impressive balance between drama and comedy would certainly be lost.Undoubtedly ""In Bruges"" is one of the most unsuspecting film successes of the 21st century. With a narrative that is easy to follow and thus more engaging, a likable cast of characters and flawless performances by the cast themselves, ""In Bruges"" genuinely is a must see film and shouldn't be overshadowed by its lack of popularity on the big screen.",In Bruges

I was browsing Netflix, just looking for a movie with my family, and picked this. I'm so glad we did! I loved this beyond words and enjoyed every second of it. 10 out of 10 is an understatement. ""In Bruges"" has to be one of the best movies i have seen. I recommend mature audiences only, at least parental guidance of course. There is coarse language, and a little bit of gory violence.

416,petershenry,A dark comedy with a heart,8,13 October 2019,"Martin Mcdoanagh is a perfect example of how to write bad people who are good.
Ray is not a good person he is rude, vulgar, miserable and to top it off a hitman. However, as the film goes on it pulls us in and shows what a broken a thoughtful man Ray really is.
Performance wise this movie is incredibly strong Colin Farrel and Brendan Gleeson are perfect as a comedic duo they play off of each other wonderfully and the banter between the two feels genuine. Also to accompany that is the more serious talks between the two. Ray's confessions to Ken are truly sad and have a lot of weight to them. Ray's relationship with Chloe also has those nice relaxing sit down moments which help to evolve these characters and create a bond between them as they slowly fall in love. These moments carry this story from what could be a generic buddy comedy film to a deep character drama with a comedic kick.
The star of the show to me is Ralph Fiennes' character-Harry. He is an angry, short tempered man with rules and his motives as the antagonist are completely understandable from start to finish. He is a man who sticks to his principles right to the end and you have to respect him for that. He is not just a cold blooded killer( all the time).
Another great feature of this film is the minor characters and their quirks. The  dwarf Jimmy, Yuri and his talk of alcoves, and the pregnant hotel owner. Each of these characters helps make the world feel big and add some extra life to this film.
Cinematography wise this is very well shot, each shot helps convey the sad melancholic tone of the film. The use of cold blues and static wide shots, set the tone perfectly. The camera here is used very well to convey emotion throughout the entire film.Overall In Bruges is a well told simple plot with fantastic performances throughout and is not bogged down by it's depressing topics of death and guilt. Each character feels real which is a credit to the writing, and the film looks and sounds fantastic. With a very powerful and open ending I highly recommend In Bruges.",In Bruges

418,Ashkevron,Seeing Right Through to the Script,5,4 February 2009,"While it has its charms--most notably Gleeson's Ken and his love of Medieval architecture--'in Bruges' mostly stumbles under the weight of trying too hard to appear witty and quirky. The dialogue, although delivered sincerely enough by Farrell, Gleeson, and especially Fiennes, seems forced, and I could not stop myself from realizing that I was listening to a script. Likewise, the screenwriter, McDonagh (who also directed), is under the delusion that dropping the f-bomb often will take care of things such as making the dialogue ""hip"" and ""funny.""There are throw-away moments of true charm here, though: Harry (Fiennes)'s love of ""fairytale"" Bruges, the random Robert Powell comparison, a completely unbelievable yet somewhat refreshing ""shoot-out"" where a normally victimized female stock-character (a proprietress) refuses to budge from her place between the shooters, and, above and beyond all, the true sense of brotherly concern Ken (Gleeson) has for Ray (Farrell). But once it gets caught up in the unfunny ""alcoves"" and ""racist dwarfs"" and a female character desperate to be shocking yet merely sweet and pretty and, ultimately, useless, the picture sinks.In time, McDonagh may write a better script, one that does not feel like a student's first attempt to impress his professor, and us.",In Bruges

Now, of course most of the credit goes to Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes, as they bring sophistication to this raunchy flick. The dialogue, I think, was the movie's strongest point, and that just may earn it a well deserved Oscar nod. The chemistry between Gleeson and Farrell was remarkable, and the introduction of Fiennes into the affair is downright brilliant. Acting wise, Gleeson gave the best performance of his career, while Fiennes unleashed his inner beast out (reminded me of Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast). Of course, the film is somewhat risqué, but ultimately it just works out so well. It's shame that not too many people saw it, because this movie's potential is just so amazing. Alas, these little gems are overlooked by the critics, but in the heart of the fans, the movie's brilliance takes center stage.

Not realism in the sense that i thought the character Ken should have survived that amount of blood loss and a fall of somewhere around twelve stories, , let alone be able to mutter words and have them make sense. But the realism in that they did not curb anything for sake of getting a lower age rating. They said what they wanted too, and used an uncommon amount of blood when compared to many other films. Especially the last time Ken is shot and when he hits the pavement from the tower. Lastly did any1 else think that the costumes and scenery for the movie that was being filmed at the end was supposed to be a reference back to the painting that Ray and Ken discussed in the museum? Let me know your thought on the matter.",In Bruges
424,tetrashvili95,A very good movie without extra parts,10,24 May 2011,"When i first saw In Bruges, i liked it very much. In a short time, a very good screenplay is brought to us in a beautiful film. I think this movie had the best original screenplay in 2008. I like that movie, because it has lots of good sights. first of all, screenplay is perfect, actors are playing normally, music is great (i think classic music makes movies very pleasant to see), and there are no extra scenes. if there is a scene, is has to be there. i have seen lots of movies which are two and a half hour long and have nothing to tell the audience but a story, which can be brought to them in hour and a half.The movie isn't boring at all. beautiful buildings and European architecture makes the movie very nice to see. In Bruges is a film, not too long and not too short, which gives you it's story in amazing way. You'll also hear some very funny dialogs in the movie, so it won't be boring 110 minutes of criminal story about guys with guns. it has a great ending and it's one of the best movies of modern times for me.I have never heard about Bruges before, but after seeing the film, i really have desire to visit it. i recommend everyone not to miss it.",In Bruges
425,fiftydubloons,An example of perfect dark comedy.,10,28 May 2013,"I remember getting really angry at an article in either Total Film or Empire that featured a list of films that were supposedly Quentin Tarantino ripoffs. As you can probably guess, In Bruges was on said list. Being of the opinion that In Bruges is better than any Tarantino movie (and significantly better than any one that isn't Inglorious Basterds) this really annoyed me. The list seemed to be based on the idea that if a movie features swearing, violence and a lot of dialogue then it must be a Tarantino-wannabe. That's stupid for a number of reasons, the main one of which being that swearing, violence and dialogue-heavy scripts were not invented by a guy whose first film came out in 1992. Another reason is that whilst Tarantino's films often seem so desperate to adhere to the boundaries they've set themselves, they often suffer as a result. Without these boundaries, In Bruges is a very different, and much better movie.Obviously it's funny. That doesn't need to be said. Look at literally any review of this movie and people will tell you how hilarious and quotable this movie is. I think one of the things that's most impressive though is how ballsy it is when it comes to rooting the characters in real emotion. Every character in the movie spends at least 95% of it's runtime being super depressed. In addition to this, half the scenes end on a depressing silence, rather than a witty punchline. The combination of these two elements, along with the obvious choices of music and setting, add up to a film that is evidently trying, and succeeding, to make the audience do more than laugh. It's an incredibly courageous move on the part of Martin McDonagh, a man who I'd name as the greatest writer living today. The trailers advertise In Bruges as some kind of wacky gangster comedy, but in fact it's something much more raw and deep than that, delving into much more complex themes than any other comedy I've seen.But that's not all. This is my second favourite movie of all-time so obviously I'm going to be enamoured with pretty much every frame of it. From the perfectly-maudlin intro to the script letting the jokes come naturally instead of forcing contrived situations down the viewers throat. In fact, another thing, I love the way that there's not a single bit of fat on the script. By this I mean that every single scene is intrinsic to a full understanding of the final scenes of the film, both in terms of understanding the plot and to a greater extent reading the thematic elements of the movie. Credit goes to the editors for this more than McDonagh, as the DVD shows around 30 minutes of deleted/extended scenes. I feel like In Bruges is a pretty much perfect movie, in that it's genuinely funny, smart, deep, imaginative, well-acted, and so many more things that I've forgotten to mention. So yeah, screw anyone who would even consider this to be in any way Tarantino-inspired.",In Bruges
426,ke82,What a Disappointment,2,6 July 2008,"It's getting harder and harder to find decent movies to attend or rent, so I was looking forward to In Bruges. High praise, Brendan Gleeson, hapless gangsters, etc. What could be better? But what a disappointment.I can't believe this movie has garnered the praise it has. It was boring and amateurish, there was nothing to the characters, and if the dialogue was half as clever as it thought it was it would've been mildly amusing. Every single plot device may as well have come with sirens and flashing lights. And to tie it all together into one big mess, Ralph Fiennes is miscast, and for Colin Farrell, apparently, acting equals working every facial muscle he owns. This is no successor to Tarentino or Sexy Beast. Not at all. If it weren't for the glimpses of Bruges's canals and medieval buildings, I'd say this was a total waste.If you want to see wit, humor, and Brendan Gleeson as a reluctant thug with a younger sidekick, try to find a copy of I Went Down.",In Bruges
427,cgf376,Excellent movie for the right audience,8,29 September 2012,"Synopsis: Hit men Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) are banished to Bruges, Belgium by their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to await further instruction after their latest job goes awry. The ""timeout"" pushes both to reflect on their lives and their work.Quick Take: Director Martin McDonagh does a remarkable job squeezing the most out of the location and the characters and manages to successfully craft a movie about assassins that focuses not on the action but on the people. All the actors, from the three male leads down to the supporting cast give spot-on performances that are just the right amount of dour, the right amount of sarcastic, and dark, and funny. This isn't an action movie, really. There is no twist, no whodunnit, no car chase sequence, no massive explosions. As such, it could come out dry to certain types of audiences. But it certainly shouldn't be missed by those with an open mind looking for a quality treat.Watch: If you like characters, one liners, sarcastic remarks, dark humor, off-beat, un-politically correct references. If you can live with it being stripped of adrenaline action scenes, you'll be rewarded with the fine performances of the actors and the director.Don't Watch: If the above-stated type of humor does not suit you and you are easily offended by certain kinds of remarks. I wouldn't recommend this to people like my mom who have short attention spans and have no appreciation for dialogue. If you're not going to mind what's being said and are relying on action and effects, then this isn't for you.",In Bruges

She was 2 dimensional and not fully actualized. She was a moot point in the movie and could've been played without any words being spoken at all and still would have come across the same way. The dwarf didn't go too gimmicky like movies usually portray them. However, the other characters were preformed beautifully. The writing was excellent sometimes almost tipping into cheesy. However, the acting brought it back from tipping over. It starts off a little too slow but slowly rolls into a more interesting film. The only flaw in the movie is that the rhythm feels more like a mini series more so than a movie.",In Bruges

I'm half Irish half Irish working in China, and thoroughly enjoying this on my PC. It makes me wonder if the Yanks get our dark underdog humour on our little Great islands?

433,bryanhchu,Simultaneously hilarious and depressing,10,10 February 2018,"In Bruges is the story of two British hitmen lying low in Bruges, Belgium after an assassination goes wrong. This movie is a perfect balance of comedy and depression. Martin Mcdonough seamlessly transitions from heavy subjects like child murder, and suicide, to goofs and gags and fat Americans. Several scenes are simultaneously heartbreaking and hilarious. There is also a masterful handling of reincorporation that is quite reminiscent of Hot Fuzz. There were several scenes in this movie that seemed to just be one-off jokes, but eventually affected the plot and characters in profound ways later on. The characters were all very distinct and fleshed out, and it's been a long time since I genuinely cared about fictional people so much. The plot is absolutely one hundred percent pitch perfect. It is meticulously balanced on the scale of unpredictability and poetic beauty. On the far left of this scale lies something like Game of Thrones, where main characters are killed left and right with no satisfying conclusion to their arch. On the far right is Star Wars, where the story is neat and satisfying, but anyone who has seen a movie in their life knows exactly what will happen ten minutes in. In Bruges is somehow far left and far right at the same time. The plot twists and turns in unexpected ways, and it doesn't stop until the very end. Yet, in the midst of this untidy anarchistic plot, a clear lesson and meaning still arises.",In Bruges

Just back recently from a cumbersome rating dilemma which saw me settle for a similar score for Pan's Labyrinth, which further strengthens my stand that IMDb should let us vote with more accuracy (for example 7.7, what pans labyrinth should've deserved). I loved in Bruges. I thought there really was nothing wrong with it. How the dark elements were incorporated into the film, as well as the mesmerizingly haunting soundtrack that just weaved into everything nice and well. Colin Farrell did surprisingly well, with his native Irish tongue it was all set up for him to nail the role. Brendan Gleeson does well in his role too. Ralph Fiennes does a stellar job, being cast as the boss Harry Waters, classically and stylishly encompassing the character. Blatantly or so, he is extremely comparable to Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast. The magnificence of the Belgian surroundings coupled with the soundtrack is what really brings this movie along. The screenplay is also equally matched if not better. I would recommend In Bruges to all who've seen one too many of the usual stuff. In the days of Transformers and 2012 and CGI, this is refreshingly engaging to those who appreciate the art of a good movie.",In Bruges

They tour the beautiful medieval scenery, meet a girl and a midget, do drugs, have some fights, some funny/stupid conversations and eventually there is a shootout. If that sounds kind of boring than you have an accurate idea of what the movie's like- kind of boring with some redeeming qualities: some interesting situations, good acting, some funny dialogue and nice cinematography. The high point by far was the Ralph Fiennes character but he doesn't show up till the movie's half over. At some of the more preposterous action situations, I had to keep reminding myself this was a comedy, or was it? I wasn't really sure, which is probably why this film didn't work for me. If I think about the setup and the Ralph Fiennes character, this could have been a really good movie, but there is just too much screen time in the first half where nothing particularly interesting or funny is going on.",In Bruges

First I was surprised by the depth of character Colin Farrell displayed, it was, I thought, a touching performance laced with nuance and intensity. The great Brendan Gleeson played the wise foil, to Farrell's brash and ignorant thug with aplomb. The real star was Martin Mcdonagh with a great script and subtle direction. Ralph Fiennes reminded me of Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast, relishing his menace. All in All, the dark humor was top notch. I will be watching for more Martin Mcdonagh films, and I highly recommend this one as a place to start.Rick",In Bruges
440,success-9,Gangster Pilgrim's Progress,9,2 September 2010,"Many critics' reviews of In Bruges have given somewhat faint praise to the film for freshening up a bit the dying genre of the glib gangster flick. But this does an incredible disservice to such an insightful and thought-provoking and big film as In Bruges. And it is a very big film, the biggest I've seen in years - a film of big ideas, and by contrast a film just as adept at meditations on the innumerable small details of real life. Its a film as big as life, and not bound by any easy comparison to any single identifiable film genre. Its even bigger than real life, delving effortlessly past the smug external demeanor of a young hoodlum and into the dreams and nightmares of his tortured soul. This is simply Colin Farrell's greatest role that I am personally aware of. Previously I thought he was just some sort of brooding poser, not to mention poofter (is that the Brit term?) - some sort of marketing-generated icon for the gays and gals, complete with scruffy fashion and face growth and cute accent. But after this role his sins are forgiven and he is redeemed, like his character is in Bruges. He immediately gets Sean Connery stature in my book. (Brendan Gleason is terrific as well.)But as to a reexamination of the gangster ethos in general, here is something quite remarkable. The film makes us to truly understand how that world is inherently a world of authority, no different than any other government. And the men that occupy that world kill other men only because they deserve to be killed, at least in the estimation of the authorities of that world who are to be obeyed. However, things like killing children and suicide are morally unconscionable to them just like they are to most people. And the men of that world are in fact real people, that need to be redeemed and are in fact redeemable - not in some simplistic revival meeting kind of way, but via a path as complex as circuitous as the world they have voluntarily chosen to inhabit, but a path that is ultimately compelling and believable. (In the process though, some of them with the strictest moral codes do not find salvation.) This is in such marked contrast to previous films like the Godfather, in which the Catholic Church for example is just an elaborate prop and backdrop exploited by proud and callous men to bolster a false appearance of stability and respectability. (Consider Michael Corleone staring stone-faced through his infant son's christening while having all his enemies whacked.) In Bruges truly humanizes gangsters in a way that has simply never been accomplished before in any other film. Is this Romanticism or Realism. It feels like the latter.But what is remarkable is how that emotional realism is achieved in the context of a vivid psychological and cinematic dreamscape of Bruges, a place that is nevertheless quite real, a cloistered world existing in a modern one - oh well I could pile on some more metaphors, but its late. Great flick though. Really great. A lot greater than many brain-dead critics in the external reviews above give it credit for. So many great scenes - Farrell gazing out from the train as he leaves Bruges, at a dismal marsh-strewn landscape with overcast skies, a landscape reflecting the state of his own soul; the young boy accidentally killed while waiting for the priest, still clutching his hand-printed list of sins to confess: ""1) Being moody; 2)Being bad at maths; 3)Being too sad;"" And yet throughout the film the unforced humor that emerges time after time in spite of all this. Its a film of vast range and ambition, its such an inexplicable disservice to compare it to a self-conscious genre flick like Pulp Fiction. (Not to say Pulp Fiction is bad.) Maybe this film is better watched alone than in a drunken crowd at Sundance, I don't know. Four out of four stars.",In Bruges

I didn't really expect to like it as much as I did. I hadn't heard much about the film before I watched it and found myself enjoying every minute of it.I have never been a big Colin Farrel fan but he was spot on in this film, he managed to balance the emotions of the character superbly between humour, and despair, agitation and excitement, innocence and guilt. He made the character interesting and believable. Brendan Gleeson wouldn't seem like an obvious choice to pair him up with but as they bounce Witticisms off each other the comedy is very funny. Ralp Fiennes cold icy character added another enjoyable dimension to the film.The dialog was excellent from start to finish. The sound track strangely, worked as well, it was almost haunting and combined with the medieval backdrop of Bruges created a good atmosphere.The ending was exciting and rewarding.Overall I think this is a superb film.Cheers",In Bruges

445,phani-bezawada,Every image and event are premeditated and accounted for.,8,1 August 2015,"Our senses often become so jaded by continuous movie-watching that past a point nothing excites us anymore. We begin to recognize the structural tropes and anticipate the twists and turns before they make an appearance on screen. Vigorous attempts of movie makers fall flat before our indifferent eyes. It has been my problem for a while now. And then this movie, In Bruges, came along with its simple premise and, after a long time, I was immersed in a movie experience. The plot is simple enough. Two contract killers complete a hit job assigned to them and, obeying the orders from their boss, come to the Dutch town called Bruges, apparently to lay low for a while. Younger one Ray (Collin Farrell) seems like he has not yet hardened enough to fit comfortably into the mold of his job. Older one Ken (Brendan Gleeson) has already come to terms with the demands of his profession. He treats Ray like his kid brother and is very indulgent towards Ray's constant complaints and bickering over their having to spend time in this ancient and dull Bruges. This irritableness of Ray is later established to have a deeper source for a reason. He has a guilt upon his conscience too heavy for his professional experience–that of accidentally killing a boy during a botched hit job. This guilt drives his thoughts towards death. But what he doesn't know yet is that that is the very fate for the fulfillment of which he was sent to Burges. Even Ken doesn't realize it until an order to kill Ray comes to him from the boss. What Kevin does, and the later consequences, consist the rest of the story. This movie is a marvel of storytelling. It reminds us again what little details are enough to make a compelling story. It creates its own world the rules of which barely correspond with the real or even cinematic worlds that we are accustomed to. Every image and event are premeditated and accounted for. And the setting of Bruges is interwoven so skillfully within the screenplay that it becomes an active character itself. I stumbled upon this movie without realizing that the director is the same person who later went on to made Seven Psychopaths, another movie that I loved very much. I've observed many people comparing Martin McDonagh with Tarantino, but I think this director is going his own way and doing his own thing. He is added to my list of directors whose IMDb accounts I keep checking to see if they are making anything new.",In Bruges
446,bigmonster82,Fantastic,8,8 May 2008,"I saw this movie on a whim. I had heard good things about it from friends, and the reviews seemed positive enough, but I wasn't necessarily chomping at the bit to see it. I wasn't terribly impressed with Martin McDonough's Oscar-winning short film Revolver, but, based on the buzz, I figured In Bruges was worth a look. I was very mistaken in my assumptions. This is an absolutely fantastic movie. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are both phenomenal, and Ralph Fiennes, though he only appears halfway through the film, is perfect as a hard-edged crime boss with a short fuse. Colin Farrell tends to catch a lot of guff for his performances, but I have always found him to be a very talented actor. He may not always choose the best roles, but in everything that I've seen him in he has engaged me as a viewer. Here, his work is superb. He nails everything about the character of Ray, and is utterly believable as a hit-man wrestling with his demons. Clemence Poesy is good as well, and obviously very beautiful and enigmatic, though her character wasn't as fully fleshed out as I would have liked. Bruges makes a gorgeous backdrop for the action of the film, and having recently returned from Belgium myself (not Bruges, however, though now I wish I'd gone there), the charm of the country and the overwhelming sense of history is captured perfectly. The fairytale town is not only beautiful, but its atmosphere and the palpable sense of medieval ideals are essential to the central ideas of the story. And what a story it is. In my opinion, the script is the strength of this film. Thematically, emotionally, and narratively, this script is firing on all cylinders. McDonough does a fantastic job of connecting the characters not only through their actions, but through the dramatic tension inherent in maintaining proximity with people whom you may not really like. The relationship that evolves between Ray and Ken is brilliant, and the secondary characters fill in the gaps admirably. The sense of sacrifice and redemption is handled very well, and at no point do the actions taken by the characters feel forced or unrealistic. Nor do their interactions with one another feel overly expository. Everything is very even-handed, and McDonough has crafted one hell of a well-balanced. The trailers lead one to believe that this is a sort of noir/comedy. It is, in a sense, and there are many funny parts, but there are some very serious themes presented here. Hell, guilt, redemption, and sacrifice are the themes that drive the story, and Martin McDounough's ability to inject humor into very serious subject matter is part of what makes this film so successful. Overall, a great movie, and an exceptionally original piece of film-making.",In Bruges

Brendan Gleeson is also one of my favorite actors, and Colin Farrell is certainly growing on me as he gets older, especially in humorous roles. It's nice to hear Colin using his real voice instead of doing American accents. Note: Some folks in the US may have a hard time understanding some of the dialogue at low volumes, and be prepared with the rewind button to catch what's being said (as well as for the ""did he just say what I think he said?"" moments). I agree that the ending could have been handled better, but PLEASE do not let that discourage you from seeing this wonderful picture. The banter between Ray and Ken is worth the price of the movie alone. Add in Ralph Fiennes cursing in a way that would make a sailor blush, the love interest Chloe, her idiot ex, the gun dealer overly obsessed with dark corners ;), and the on-again-off-again friendship with a ""little person"", you have an intriguing and thoroughly entertaining movie, smartly written dialogue, and it is well worth your time.

And this movie gives you a heck of a lot to make it your favourite.Martin McDonagh is a man who carved out a successful career for himself in theatre, about a decade ago I think. And by the end of the movie it's pretty clear that it's written by a playwright. Every scene had fantastic dialogue. Within this dialogue the characters are built up for funny characters to real people in a real situation. And every scene has a purpose in the film as a whole, each scene contributing to the ending, overall plot line, character, and overall tone simultaneously.This is why this film is fantastic- it seems to do everything at the same time, and not a single line is wasted. It all leads up to this perfect ending, to this brilliant climax that leaves you deliciously satisfied. Even the score and backdrop photography were fantastic, the score giving this slightly haunting and disenchanted feel, and the photography complementing it perfectly.All in all, there's a reason why it's got 8.1, although it perhaps deserves a rating just a little higher.",In Bruges

Other than that, I had no complaints about the movie, and even that scene didn't ruin it because of the fact that the movie was brilliant.I suggest everybody see this movie if you have a sense of humor and you're alright with gratuitous language.9/10",In Bruges
455,julienpinault,'In Bruges',8,30 September 2018,"'In Bruges' is the directorial debut of Irish director Martin McDonagh who has recently become known for 'dramadies' such as 'Seven Psychopaths' and 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.'McDonagh has written and directed a brilliant film, balancing tonal extremes masterfully. It contains hilarious comedy, dark, emotional moments and graphic violence, yet none ever feels out of place. All these elements are balanced with skill.The hitmen portryed by Colin Farrel and Brendan Gleason are developed subtly as the story progresses. Ralph Fiennes also delivers a fiercely profane, hilariously entertaining performance as their uncompromising boss. The setting of 'Bruges' is used by McDonagh with precision, introducing its aspects subtly throughout the script with later payoffs, such as the tower and canal. By the time the climactic action takes place, we already know the town of 'Bruges' and its basic geography as well as the characters.Similarly to McDonagh's other films, he does not shy away from extremities in the script. Characters say things which you would not usually hear in a film, making them feel more realistic, and also hilarious, although definitely not to everyone. I definitely found it extremely funny, with smarter comedy than most actual straight 'comedy' films that are released currently.",In Bruges

It promises (and actually has) more character, more European scenery. But to what end? All abnormally amoral films (like the ones name before) live up to a glorious and cynical ending. Not so this one. The climax is of extraordinary bad taste and humor (me flinching and not laughing at all).The first movie in a long time I stopped watching before the end. Avoid it.",In Bruges

459,jez999,Would I recommend it? No.,3,27 April 2008,"OK, so this movie is /watchable/. It didn't make me want to vomit with cringeworthiness like, say, Eragon. It had some novelty to it, it was funny in places. That said...I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie. There were several reasons I didn't like it. It's a ""feel bad"" movie. You might come out of it wanting to go home and have a bit of a cry about how nothing really made you feel like justice had been done, or your brain had been pleasured.For a start, you'd better be prepared to hear one of the two main protagonists, Ray (Colin Farrell), whinge and whine about how he just HATES Bruges, every 5 minutes or so in the movie. This grated on me. A lot. Ray's character irritated me in just about every way imaginable. He is rude, arrogant, ignorant, and gets a kick out of hitting, killing, and insulting people (particularly midgets). For this, the storyline rewards him with the love of a beautiful Belgian girl. This felt very unjust, and just plain irritated me for the whole movie. I kept hoping Ray was going to die.You'd also better not be easily offended. When people say this movie has lots of black humour, they're not lying. Few taboos are left unbroken, short perhaps of paedophilia. Drugs, sex, violence, racism, insults, you name it, it's in there. I'm not easily offended, nor am I politically correct, but the casual overuse of these somewhat nasty tones for frequent black humour also grated on me. It made me feel bad.In conclusion, you MAY want to see this movie. It may surprise you at times, but probably not in a good way. It will not make you feel happy, and you'll probably be quite satisfied that those who die in the movie, die. They're all quite nasty people.",In Bruges
460,axlrose1504,In Bruges..... What a sneaky little b*****d!,10,17 June 2008,"In Bruges came out of absolutely nowhere and put our faith back into the British gangster flick with its fast paced script, amazing acting talents and sheer wittiness.Colin Farrell is slightly underrated in his acting talents but mainly due to the fact his acting CV consists of roles in slightly terrible films (Daredevil for one) but to deny this man his praise for his portrayal of Ray in this film would be nothing short of a disgrace. Holed up in a the shitty little town of Bruges after a hit goes wrong you can see that the character of Ray is too large for such a small town. Brendan Gleeson brings us one of the best characters I've seen him play in a long time as Ken the professional hit-man acting more along the lines of a father figure to Ray. In Bruges is one of the freshest pieces of British cinema i've witnessed since Sexy Beast and we all know the two main reasons that film was fantastic but in this the angry English hit-man/gangster type role is left to the ever great Ralph Fiennes playing Harry, who's psychotic and ruthless persona sets up for a fantastic villain. Kudos to Farrell, Gleeson and Fiennes for bringing us such an a brilliant piece of film and to the director for making one of the best British flicks of 2008.",In Bruges
461,Dylon060,Surprisingly amazing,9,6 May 2021,"In Bruges definitely defied all expectations more than any other film I've seen in recent memory. The pacing is sublime, throughout the whole runtime you are being led on by the story that feels like eating a well baked pie from your grandmother. Cinematography is very pleasing, its subtle, yet loud, its right in all of the right ways; the cinematography heavily uses the scenery of Bruges and the characters to create a unique story. The acting on the other hand from Colin Farrell, as well as Brendan Gleeson is extremely addicting, even though the majority of the film is focused on the both of them. Not even to mention the writing is pretty decent with some fun banter that kept the story going and brought humor fourth.I think movies like this need to be paid more attention to for upcoming film-makers, between the dialogue, cinematography, writing, pacing, there is so much that can be taken notice of. In my opinion it is a fantastic movie that literally anyone should watch.",In Bruges

With the acting and directing at top notch, film goers should have payed more attention toward it. Martin M. directed this film in 13 days and has made a little masterpiece. Colin Farrell and Brenden Gleason gave the performances of their lives and Ralph Finnes showed once again that he can act in any genre. The violence was very graphic which is fine by me and the language was offensive and very funny. This black comedy is a gem and should be seen by anybody over 18 (even though I am 15! :)). I hope this film is recognized for what it truly is; a story of an undying friendship. This film is in my illustrious top 5 and will stay there for as long as I live.",In Bruges
463,garry0707,Tw Out of Three Ain't Bad,8,14 March 2009,"This is an excellent piece of work - with one big fault. Firstly this film is a brilliant study of the interaction between two very different characters, superbly played by Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell (Brendan Gleeson's Ken is by far the better character). Two characters who are united by only one thing - they are killers, even being Irish doesn't bring them closer to each other. However, as the plot develops they do bond and become almost like a comfortable married couple. This forms the most and best part of the film.Now for the negative - Ralph Fiennes!! I couldn't believe how such a superb actor could have got his character so wrong. He was wooden, the acting was false and the character was so unbelievable. I heard the voice on the phone and thought that was awful - but when I saw who it was I was shocked. Instead of being a believable tough gangland boss, he came over as a poor parody of brick top in Snatch.Overall excellent, acting well two out of three ain't bad!!",In Bruges

Horrible acting (non- Flemings pretending to be Flemish) Every scene degenerates into some kind of bar fight. The only thing going for the movies is that it is filmed in Brugges but that is the only thing Flemish about it. Of course there are the stereotypical fat Americans in the first Brugges brawl scene (one of many). More Americans/Canadians in the second or third restaurant brawl scene. Had I seen this in a theater I would have walked out but in my own home I had a morbid fascination at how this pre-adolescent type plot would work out and how many more sick acts of gratuitous violence could be added into one shallow plot. Save your time and money and go play Grand Theft Auto or go watch a Claude van Damme movie if this kind of twisted misanthropic garbage gets you off.",In Bruges
465,moro_650,"""In Bruges"".. Simply Captivating!",9,14 March 2010,"I never actually knew who Martin McDonagh (The famous Irish playwright) was before I watched this movie,and i wondered more as i watched specially that the movie is well crafted on all aspects ( acting, directing, writing, camera motion),it seemed it belonged to someone experienced as its so original and on a high level of creativeness.Probably not so many films, were made in the city of ""Bruges"", one of the most beautiful cities I've ever seen in a movie, the idea of choosing ""Bruges"" a city that's unknown for a lot of people is brilliant itself, as ""Bruges"" is the main character, its also so beautiful, calm, and mysterious.The story of the movie revolves around ""Ray"" and ""Ken"", two hit men, who hide in ""Bruges"" after an almost successful job! ""Ray"" on his first job does something horrible, makes him feel guilty, which leads him think of death, what's after life.. heaven, hell and purgatory.. he wonders if these things really exist, and discusses that with ""Ken"".""Ken"" is in some sort of a dilemma, when the boss ""Harry"" asks him to kill ""Ray"" because of what he has done. ""Ken"" has a strong relationship with ""Harry"", and on the other hand he believes that ""Ray"" deserves a second chance and might become a better person. Also, ""Harry"" the boss killed the guy who murdered Ken's wife, the wife that ""Ken"" truly loved.The whole idea of the strong bonds between the characters, no matter how are they vicious murderers, might not be so original, but the originality here lies in the amount of sacrifice, and the strong beliefs each of them carry, it also highlights how beliefs and values could be crucial at times, and the paradox in how those murderers can die for the sake of values and beliefsThe Movie discusses through the characters, how the decisions people take can affect their lives, and the way things get complicated because of what they believe in, ""Ken"" believes that ""Ray"" deserves a second chance, while ""Harry"" thinks that he should be killed for what he's done. The main character here which is ""Bruges"", declares an end for this struggle, having them all killed(we're left to wonder if Ray is actually dead or not) Martin McDonagh's theatrical sense, covered the movie gently with sardonicism , showing every race with significant trait or behavior; The Americans through out the movie are shown as kind of a funny stupid characters(the fat family & the dwarf), the Irish characters themselves are so arrogant, the people of Belgium were so strict and cold, the Jewish character ""Yuri"" is shown with the ""dumb dumb"" bullets & the ""Uzi"".The camera had the same sense too displaying ""Bruges"" with all of its mystery and darkness as they walked in the streets also ; *The shot were the dwarf was talking about the war between the blacks and the whites the camera shows us the 2 prostitutes which one of them was African and the other was a European blond, and the two of them doing drugs next to each other! *The other scene in which a dog looks in contempt to ""Rey"" because of what he has done.*""Rey"" running while bleeding to the location of the dream sequence , meeting people with freaky masks, as an indication of him going to hell.The dialogue is also remarkable we discover a lot of how these two people view life, ""McDonagh"" made the dialogue so simple and yet deep, so spontaneous and funny as the characters are talking it was well employed to serve the movie, McDonagh never drifted in long or useless chitchat no matter how tempting it was to do that. Each character had its highly significant style of talking even secondary characters which reminds us of Quentin's style in dialogues. In an interview McDonagh said that it had some influence from Tarantino's style, but he said that he decided to take it somewhere deeper.You can't talk about all of this and neglect the awesome soundtrack by Carter Burwell, the movie might have been a little less brilliant if it wasn't for Burwell's music. Throughout the film we find the music describing feelings of guilt, sadness,fear and the intimidating beauty of the city of ""Bruges"". Burwell was there and ready for the shift, when the scenes got more fast and were full of action in the chase scene between ""Ray"" and ""Harry"".Mcdonagh is a great movie director, who for some reason his work in theater seems to be smoother than film making, although he said he always wanted to become a movie director, we need to see more of his works the coming years or i'll go crazy! The Movie is simply captivating the same way the city of ""Bruges"" is in-reality and in the movie that non of the characters came out of there and so did I!",In Bruges

467,adorabell,Too great to miss,10,19 February 2008,"First off, I'd like to mention that this IS a Black Comedy, it's meant to be funny in a morbid way. Also, this is not a movie that should be seen for those with a faint heart as is suggested by the 18A rating (in Canada at least, no idea for other countries).Moving on, I have to say that this was a great movie, much better than I anticipated and I was already ready for something fantastic. The scenery and music are really amazing, especially as a balance to the extremely foul and crude language that are rampant. Though that might put some people off it adds to the hilarity of the situation, the contrast between this beautiful and melancholic music and scenery and the dialog that goes on between the two main characters.There is, of course, a great deal of violence, but that is to be expected of a movie about hit men. THe fact that everything took place in Bruges makes it all the more funny, especially with all the jokes that are made about both the town and Belgium in general.There is much more that I can say but I think that the film should speak for itself, go watch it. Please do keep in mind though that this is not a slap-stick comedy, nor a sit-com as generally perceived. A lot of it is laughing at the absurdity of what is happening and the dialog which is witty and great. Once again, go watch the movie, you won't regret it.",In Bruges
468,jellobiafra2000,"If anyone believes that ""In Bruges"" is overrated, they can go ahead and blame me",9,20 February 2008,"In order to see ""In Bruges"" in my neck of the woods, one would have to be specifically looking for it. It is a film that has been put out in limited release immediately after Oscar Picks have been announced. In other words, the studios aren't giving it much of a shot. So when I hear people refer to this film as ""overrated,"" I scratch my head with a bemused gaze. What were you looking for? What did you think you were about to see? My expectations were exceeded by no small margin. The genre of the bantering hit men has no doubt been played out again and again, but ""In Bruges"" seemed to put life back into that concept. Others feel that this film doesn't know what kind of film it wants to be, but I argue that this ""weakness"" is actually the films biggest triumph. The audience reaches a comfort zone of seeing Colin Farrells's character giddy with the prospect of seeing a film crew ""filming midgets,"" only to witness the death of a young boy within minutes. Bruges itself becomes a character, and I felt as though I could comfortably navigate myself through the town (where I have never been) after seeing this film.The basics can be summed up quickly: Two hit men are sent to hide out in Bruges, Belgium after executing a hit in London. Farrell hates the town, while Brendan Gleeson (who is admittedly un-hitmanish)loves the simplicity of his sightseeing. Simple, right? However, within that simple structure lies intricacies that show the dichotomy between the two characters to the point where it is tough to decide who you sympathize more with. Colin Farrell seems to be caught in a state of arrested development; a pouting- yet humorous- eight year-old, who just so happens to be a novice hit-man. Gleeson reminds one of the history professor who has just retired and is seeing the sights, though he just so happens to be an experienced hit-man. The pleasure is in their exchanges; the little boy and the artful old man who have both found ways to rationalize their occupations to themselves, and are stuck together in Bruges.Not enough? The absurdities of the situation are amplified by ideas that would have came off well on Mr. Show: A hit-man who wants to talk his mark out of suicide, a racist midget who ironically condemns others for their physical appearances, and the most damage I've ever seen come from shooting blanks. I don't mean to offset the fact that there is a serious side as well. Death is very real here, and humor does not make life cheap. Farrell is honestly suicidal and the image of the dead boy haunts the characters, as well as the audience. But the most important thing is that this film works. I did laugh (and I'm not a saccharine individual) and I did care about the characters.To think that a film is high on itself does not move me in either direction, mainly because I've never really figured out what it means. What should a film be? Modest? What should this film have done? Cut scenes that one individual might not find as funny as another one? I enjoyed this film beyond all expectations, and if this film is ""not smart"" or ""Too high on itself"" then I guess I will accept a regression to being thought of as one of the dumb ones.",In Bruges
469,caulfieldland-1,If you like your comedy black and without sugar...,10,28 January 2009,"This is a hard movie to classify, let alone review. Where do you start? It IS humorous, but essentially it is a tragedy. It is unashamedly politically incorrect, but it does so indiscriminately. The central characters are really reprehensible in their actions & views and hardly distinguishable from the 'bad guys'. Wow - just like in real life.The scenes of Bruges are beautifully shot, the script is clever and funny and the acting first rate. The whole movie is a work of art. It became my favourite movie from the first viewing but I left it nearly a year before reviewing it as I thought my enthusiasm may subside. It has not: I have given this film 10/10. There is a wonderfully warm paternal relationship between Ken (Brendan Gleeson) & Ray (Colin Farrell) both characters are beautifully written with depth and wit. The background story unfolds gently without any fanfares that would insult the viewer. There are several very interesting characters floating around Bruges with Ray & Ken many of whom have good lines and memorable presence in the film: Tourists, drug dealers, a dwarf and a ticket seller, all with their part to play and who play it well. The movie changes tempo in the final half hour becoming more action orientated and for me this is the weakest part. But the ending itself is perfect for the film. It has ambiguity which is something I normally hate, but a happy ending would be out of the question in this story and who the hell wants to see a sad one?",In Bruges
470,vandemaelekurt,The best Belgian film ever,9,4 August 2008,"It doesn't happen too often that international productions are filmed in Belgium. That's why it was big news in Belgium when Martin McDonagh came to Bruges to shoot his film over here. A film with a title like this, couldn't be filmed anywhere but in Belgium, you can argue. Right, but the film could as well have been called 'In Prague', 'In Sevilla', 'In Florence' or 'In Talinn' if you want. Only, Martin McDonagh sincerely seemed to be mesmerized by the city which we like to call the Venice of the North. Bruges is beautiful, fairytale-like and on a certain level the city really looks like an open-air-museum, though the mayor of Bruges and his band try very hard to make Bruges a modern, contemporary city and succeed to have it be more. So, it's human for foreigners in the first place to be mesmerized by Bruges. And indeed, it is possible that Martin McDonagh loved the city that much that he really wanted his film to be made over there. In that case, Bruges is very lucky. But whether Bruges did everything to get this production to their city or it was the director or the producer who decided to film in Bruges, it makes no difference, the result is great. It's a story about two hit men arriving in Bruges. As a viewer the only information we get at first is that something went wrong with their last job. So their boss gave them the order to travel to Bruges, and keep low for a while, try to be unnoticed and enjoy the great views. The oldest of the two seems to be the smarter one. He enjoys to do some sightseeing and loves the old buildings, the museums and the great paintings by Flemish masters. He is brilliantly played by Brendan Gleeson. You believe he can be a tough guy, who is capable of murdering someone, but on the other hand he's very soft, sweet and nice, gentle and a joy to be around. One likes to listen to him when he talks, and you can't dream of a better companion to find hanging around in a bar Bruges and to have a couple of beers with. His partner is the wild one, he is played by Colin Farrell, the actor who seemed to have forgotten for a couple of years that he was an actor. Hollywood wanted him to be a star instead. An image that didn't him. He is an actor indeed, and he proves it here. A brilliant one. He's a comedian even. I didn't know he was capable of giving such a performance. Really astonishing. The rest of the cast is also great. But of course everything stands or falls with Bruges and the performances of the two leading actors. As a Flemish Belgian it is a pity we don't get to see one Flemish actor in the film, while Bruges is in Flanders and the only Belgians in the film are played by Dutch, French and Walloon actors, who -- mind you  are all great. I couldn't think of a negative word on this film. It's the best comedy I've seen in a long time. I laughed my head off. Not once, but also the second time I went to see the film. Bruges is so lucky that this film is made over here. Although McDonagh and his cast make fun of the city and of boring Belgium all the time, it's the greatest publicity Bruges and Belgium could dream of. The film shows how beautiful some corners of our country are, and how great it is to live over here. I was proud to be Belgian before seeing this film, I am even more so after seeing it. And I will see it again and again. It's so funny when something you love is made fun of. We know it's good, so everyone can laugh. Also great are the constant laughs at the expense of the fat American tourists. Easy laughs, I know, but funny nevertheless.",In Bruges

How wrong I was.From the very first line, I was hooked. The dialogue between Farrell and Gleeson is hilarious, particularly because of the Irish wit that makes this movie what it is. In Bruges contains such dark, 'un-PC' humour, and is quite brutal at times, but this just adds to the charm of the movie. Although, it is safe to say, you will be shocked at some point watching this, regardless of how thick-skinned you are. I am actually surprised they were allowed to release this, but so happy they did. My only fault with this movie is the ending (I won't ruin it) as it was rather cruel, and some of the scenes involving gunshots are especially revealing and callous. The setting is beautiful, and the diverse mixture of characters (the man in the ticket booth, the fat Americans and the skinhead ex-boyfriend to name a few) make this a magnificent experience.

It is also sprinkled with some clever and occasionally hilarious dialog. The hotel scene in the end was just classic. Colin Farrell's character had one of the most likable personalities. Sure, he has no tact, but you find yourself chuckling instead of being offended. I don't think I've ever found myself this hard at racist banter.The shots were gorgeous. I'm sure I'm not the only one wanting to visit Bruges now. The editing was excellent too. The pacing was just perfect. I barely felt 107 minutes go by. No scene got left my mind wandering. Not once did I feel like checking my watch.Finally, the ending. It was just brilliant. I felt like crying. I didn't, but I actually wanted to. The way the story went full circle was reminiscent of Polanski's Chinatown. In fact, it might have made the same impact.

What my friends soon realize is that this movie is completely off the wall! It masterfully balances comedy, violence and drama. There are so many laugh out loud scenes that if I tried to describe all of them I would explain the entire film, suffice to say by the end my throat was sore from laughing so god damned much. The characters are amazingly well realized especially Ralph Fiennes, who provides an amazing performance. Also people who say that Colin Farrel is a poor actor will retract those comments after seeing this film.

There are some violent scenes (it is a movie about assassins, after all), but it's really more drama and comedy than action.Some aspects of the movie really stretch credibility, though, and unnecessarily (the plot did not depend on the sloppiness). The viewer is left wondering what the police in Brugges are really up to--all the murder and mayhem going on in the town square and even the many passers-by barely seem to notice, let alone the police.

In Bruges is one of those few movies which appears beyond everyones expectations and in my opinion can easily be called a modern Cinema masterpiece.This Drama-comedy movie, made in 2008, narrates the story of two Irish contract killers, which after a tragic accident in a mission, are asked by their boss to go Bruges and spend two weeks there until they receive the next orders.The 37 years old director and scriptwriter, Martin McDonough, casted Collin Farrell (Alexander & Phone boot) as the main character of the movie, And Brandon Gleeson (Troy & Braveheart) as Farrell's supporting character. Farrells acting was called his ""his A-game"" by the Guardian and brought him the best leading Actor award at the 66th Golden Globe awards.Almost everything about this movie is well planned. Combination of the Drama and Dark comedy and a wonderful script, with a great theme music and amazing acting by the entire cast alongside the beautiful views of the city Bruges, makes this movie more and more interesting, every second.The movie wasn't able to achieve a good box-office success back in 2008, but it was given a positive review by critics and was highly appreciated by the audience. The entire movie was a new and special experience for me and personally the last lines of the script were really touching and affected me like a ""Knock-out punch"". Brilliant!",In Bruges
479,richard-fleming-171-215730,Hilarious,8,17 May 2019,I watched this movie from the very beginning to the very end and this is pure comedy gold. There is a hilarious midget which made this even better,In Bruges
480,miranda_ya,simply great,10,1 July 2008,"loved it.Ralph Feinnes was great as always. He is always such a good villain. I love his bad guys. Colin Farrel proved, that he is great actor. first with Cassandra's dream and now this.Very beautiful setting. I love Bruges, I agree that it is one of the most peaceful places, which is why, it was a good choice for the location. At times movie is just hilarious, other times very sweet and touching and many pearls of wisdom if you really look into it.Therefore I highly recommend for everyone to watch it. I promise you will not regret it:))",In Bruges
481,luis-boaventura22,IN BRUGES is an excellent example of how an original and brilliant narrative can be undermined by over-performance of an actor.,6,29 December 2015,"The plot is very well constructed, containing essential elements of both tragedy and comedy, a mixture resulting in a surprising acidity. The characters are driven, surrounded by the dream city of Bruges, through psychological conflicts both funny and desperate.However, IN BRUGES is an excellent example of how an original and brilliant narrative can be undermined by over-performance of an actor.Absolutely flawless interpretation of Ralph Fiennes in the role of Harry. Fiennes is a rare actor with stunning versatility, able to transform in both aberrant Amon Goeth (Schindler's List) as the innocent Justin Quayle (The Constant Gardener). Harry is no exception: Fiennes embodies with incredible easiness the surgical brutality of the character, capturing his private moral principles with naturally. This adds a fundamental coherence to the outcome of the film (anagnorisis +peripeteia), without which, no doubt, all the work would collapse.The exact opposite can be said about Colin Farrell performance. A desperate attempt to add a childish innocence to the character overrides his likelihood. In other words, an exaggerated performance, inconsistent with the sobriety of Fiennes and Brendan Gleeson (probably a view shared solely by this writing, considering the Golden Globes received by that performance).I believe that the work of Farrell, data venia, weighed in the assessment, belittling, by contrast, an excellent narrative.",In Bruges

483,IronandSoul,More than just a dark comedy movie,9,3 January 2013,"Before I saw In Bruges, I was under the impressions it'd be a black comedy. Now, I respect Farrell as an actor and enjoyed dark humor/ comedy. I definitely went into this without any expectations really, just to enjoy its humor. However, you quickly come to realize its MUCH more than that. Sure, its humours (very good writing might i add) but it has far more depth than i expected. By the end of the film, i was completely blown away. Acting is emotional and excellent. Farrell shows his diversity as an actor and I thoroughly enjoyed Ralph Fiennes' character as well. The writing is some of the best i've ever seen, the script is filled with deep three-dimensional characters. A must see.",In Bruges
484,th-economou,nice movie but i expected more,6,9 January 2013,"Both Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson were very good in their roles. Also the pictures from Bruge were awesome, like a fairytale!! At the beginning it was nice that there were two people doing sightseeing without purpose but in the same time knowing that something strange is going to happen. It would be better if we had an idea about the relationship of the two contract killers before their first common job went wrong, something from their past.After a while the plot was expected and along with some excesses on the way people died and the shootouts (which i didn't find funny if that was the purpose of the director) were the two main elements i didn't like at the movie.I was expecting I do not strongly recommend the movie but it's worth watching if you like action with some smart dialogs and a bit of English humor",In Bruges
485,PearlSmash,Better than the movie,3,22 June 2013,"Let's be honest, the only reason I'm writing this review is the fact that I live in Bruges myself. I'm almost ashamed to admit that after seeing this nonsense. The storyline is about as thin as the paper it was written on and filled with totally unbelievable plot twists. Imagine this: one of the gangsters jumps off the belfry (84 meters high) and has a nice little conversation when lying on the pavement he landed on. If you think that's ridiculous wait until you see the ending. It's about the dumbest I've ever seen in any movie.The only thing they've done right to shoot it in the most beautiful city in Belgium. The scenery is excellent and the only reason I rated 3/10 in stead of the 1/10 it would normally deserve. People who know tell me that tourist revenues have gone up after this movie was made. At least we've got something out of it.Bottom line: don't watch this. Come to Bruges. It's better than the movie.",In Bruges

The movie is shot in the beautiful Bruges which I have visited many times since I am from Holland.My favorite scene is where the fat man tries to see the tower and meets Collin Farrel downstairs. I have not laughed so much in years. The funny thing is that all the political and stereotype incorrect statements are brought in a very humorous way. My colleague watched it as well and turned the movie off halfway, I guess he did not understand the humour.I wish more movies are made like this. I regard it in the same class as Pulp Fiction.",In Bruges

But it wasn't. I don't know whether its an adapted screenplay or an original one, still this is such a movie that i won't mind even if the novel is written for the movie. A classy cinematography, Gothic photography, amazing screenplay (the most unpredictable one), very mature acting by a superb star-cast, enough humor to keep me amused with a wide smile on my face, and the core of it all, the theme or drama never being misplaced in this simple looking complex film. The director Martin McDonaugh is a winner already. I would certainly not compare it to anything that has been done before, but would go as far to say it a benchmark for the movies to come. A complete package of everything that is required for a blockbuster but with a little difference because it is in Bruges.",In Bruges

(OSCAR SNUB)",10,16 July 2015,"Beautifully shot with impeccable acting, I watched this because I am enjoying Farrell in True Detective and I am high and have insomnia. This movie is not predictable because every time you make an assumption you are wrong. The imagery, the filming, the philosophies they speak of everything about this movie is perfect. Even the couple of far fetched scenes work wonders and are part of its central fairy-tell in purgatory theme. I look forward to seeing what else the writer/director has plans on releasing, I hope he continues the brilliance he showcased here!

489,Nicholas-goyette,There's just something In Bruges you won't find anywhere else,10,12 January 2014,"I found Myself compelled to write a review about this movie, if only to relive a little bit the experience. It starts slow, a bit over-dramatic, but it builds up into something powerful, something you can't and don't want to forget. It became one of my personal favourites the first time I watched it. The second time was as Good as the first, and I wanna watch again someday.There is Just something about this movie. There is a lot of very unique concepts like Drama mixed with midgets Humor, and climatic changes mixed with dark Humor. Carrying these concepts to the big screen is the perfect Cast that made me totally change my mind about Collin Farrell's value as an actor, and showcased Ralph Fiennes in a Godlike performance of the perfect antagonist you come to like way more than the protagonists.The Dialogue are perfect, and the story, while Balanced between simple and complex carries a punch that lands with power and precision. It's an instant favourite that I hope will become more and more know as the years pass by.",In Bruges
490,chris-stannard,A wait in purgatory,9,29 April 2008,"Masquerading as an action black comedy the film sets out to establish the town of Bruges as purgatory. The main protagonists wait for judgement for their past sins in the town. One character overtly expresses his desire for repentance, the other's sins are more deeply hidden. The point is emphasised by overtly referencing Bosch's Last Judgement.The consistently witty dialogue is gallows humour and the pair are each made to suffer graphically for their sins. The younger character is left with the possibility of redemption the elder perhaps resigned to a transfer to hell although his descent is through a frosty air earlier equated to a fairy tale.The resolution is perhaps a too trite symmetry with Bosch's painting brought to life as a film set.Other than this over emphasis (perhaps necessary for a mainstream audience) this is a well scripted, tightly directed film with marvellous performances.I hadn't laughed out loud watching a film for a long time.",In Bruges

Just because it's a perfectly filmed feeling. Feeling of the city. And because Martin McDonagh is master of emotional swing. He absolutely nails getting from a high point cheerful mood to the deepest sadness in a matter of few words of dialogue. And this city is perfect to be filmed this way. It's just like time and space and human skill all collided in one point. That's how this movie came to be.",In Bruges
492,macfcc,Mostly rubbish,4,8 March 2009,"I can't believe this film is currently rated so high over here. It looks good for the first couple of minutes, but soon you realize it's going to be rubbish, mainly because of one of the poorest scripts I can remember in recent times.The dialogues are so badly written as to become really worried about McDonagh's future in the business if he insists on shooting his own material. He's technically quite correct as a director, although there are some worrying choices in that department too, like the rather too long sightseeing sequences of Bruges that sometimes feel like you're watching a travel documentary instead of a movie.And the dialogues, oh boy. They are trying so hard to be funny, smart and witty, a la Tarantino, but they fail miserably. Some of the stuff, like the ""midget"" discussing whose side he'd be on if a war between dwarfs was to start (sorry, I can't remember the silly, unfunny details) are downright embarrassing, and so are other bits during the whole movie. The story-telling is not exactly brilliant either.Brendan Gleeson is quite good, Farrell is annoying as hell, and Fiennes overdoes it a bit too much.Not worth your time or your money. Avoid!",In Bruges

I sat down to watch it for a creative writing class and found myself amazed by the incredible writing at work here.The plot is complex and can be very emotionally draining but it only serves to turn this film into an artistic beauty. Colin Farrell is perfect in this film. He plays a character somewhere in between desperate and lost and yet still finds a way to make you laugh. His best performance by far. Brendon Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes deserves a lot of credit as well as their performances absolutely blew me away.This is one of those films where everything is said and done and thought for a reason.

Trite, formulaic, every ""ironic"" interaction was telegraphed to the viewer minutes ahead of time. When Colin Farrell's tough guy character is in the restaurant and has an interaction with an obnoxious weenie American, I've seen this exact scene so many times before... It was an agonizing 5 minutes as you sat through the predictable screen writing 101 set up moves culminating in the oh so ironic ""punch"" line. Painful. Colin Farrell's acting was way too forced and over-the-top for me, he seemed like he had to try way to hard, I found it distracting. Admittedly, the script and the directing are largely responsible here. Maybe I've seen too many movies, but this was just plain bad.",In Bruges
497,stephen-114,One of my rare 10s,10,15 March 2008,"The films that I find myself thinking about afterwards are of two kinds - the best and the worst. In the case of the worst I am trying to work out just why they are so bad, in the case of the best, like In Bruges, the rare 10s, they make such an impact that I cannot get them out of my head. It was only later that I realised that Martin McDonagh has, apparently, lifted his basic situation - two hit men whiling away the time waiting for instructions as to their next victim - from Harold Pinter's early one-act stage play The Dumb Waiter. However The Dumb Waiter ends when the message (the same one as in In Bruges) arrives. McDonagh then extends the scenario in quite unexpected directions, the foundations of which have been meticulously laid, sometimes by a mere throwaway line or gesture, earlier in the film. The film is full of memorable moments - dialogue, incident or characterisation - that interweave to form an indelible impression.Some of the comments posted seem to take exception to the fact that In Bruges is difficult to categorise - that terrible compulsion of the film industry to fit every film into a ""genre"". This is a film that is genuinely uncategorisable. It is often very funny, sometimes poignant and touching, sometimes darkly frightening, always thought-provoking. To categorise it as, say, a ""comedy-thriller"" would be to seriously sell its qualities short.There is one very good reason for the film's special elusive quality - it is very Irish. Although strictly speaking it would not count as an Irish production and Martin McDonagh was born in London, all his stage writing stems from a strong Irish sensibility and it is no accident that the two leading characters are played by Irish actors (albeit actors familiar to an American audience playing Americans!). The ability to see pathos behind humour, as well as the funny side of tragedy, is a peculiarly Irish trait.The brilliance of the script is matched by superb performances from the two leads as well as all the supporting cast, however small the part. The only weak link (and it is a very minor criticism) is Ralph Fiennes as the boss figure who, as one other posting commented, was more convincing on the phone than in person, perhaps, as many have pointed out, because of unfavourable comparison with Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast. Brendan Gleeson is, as always, impeccable, Colin Farrell gives his best performance since Intermission, both are subtle and totally believable. The supporting characters are so effective partly because they are very well cast, partly because they have been written with such attention to detail. Almost my favourite moment is when the hotel owner hands over a phone message from the boss, carefully typed out including all the obscenities, with a personal hand-written correction at the bottom - ""I am not the receptionist..."".I am hoping that by writing the above I will be able to stop myself thinking about In Bruges, but somehow I doubt it!",In Bruges
498,stupidmonkey00,Important quote missing:,10,5 July 2008,"Ray: ""You *Can't* sell horse tranquilliser to a midget!"" I was massively surprised with this film. It has an impressively good story which honestly stands out in the miasma of ""Hitman gets a heart"" films stumbling onto our screens. In Brgge manages to pull of a yarn that is both touching and side splittingly funny at the same time. The visuals are nicely shot catching the quaintness of little Brugge in all it's diminutive Glory.The acting is also spot on with the main leads providing excellent portrayal of their characters; Fiennes is brilliant, Gleeson is noble and Farrel is frankly hilarious in what is the best part I've seen him play.This film comes highly recommended, so much so that I had to spit out 10 lines of a review on here for the first time.

And of course did we hear Ken had ever been to Bruges before as it did seem he had worked for Harry for a long time, Yuri could of course have been around as it also did seem Harry knew him. Also Colin Farrell could well of survived so you could cut back from 1994 time to 2014 time. This time Ray could be working for another gangster and this time he has got to go back to Bruges to kill someone else.

Colin Farrell shows with this film, what his potential is. Brendan Gleeson had impressed me too and Ralph Fiennes was like always. I think that this film is a very well made dark comedy. The development of the story is thrilling, and you get no time bored. The relationship between Ray (Farrel) and Ken (Gleeson) is illustrated excellent in the movie. The characters are real and you can feel with them. To create characters in movies isn't easy, but this is one of the most important elements, that make a film, a 'film'. And this is made successful in this picture, which let's hope more from Martin McDonagh as a film director.The tension in the beginning of the film is very important. It gives the viewer the chance to discover the two hit men. But when you get to know, that Ken's mission is to kill Ray the real tension begins. And at this point, in an old town like Bruges, which is like a fairy tale: the fairy tale begins. I recommend this picture to everyone. One of the big films of the last years.

I never knew that Colin Ferrel could do comedy like he does? The dialog, which is very tongue and cheek and politically in correct, had me in stitches throughout. The idea of hit men with ethics could have become tiring pretty quickly, but the director makes it work for the whole movie.My only grip is the incredible violence in the last five minutes. The story line probably required the killing that occurs but why did it have to be incredibly graphic? I have no idea why directors feel the need to spray blood all over the screen in a final climax. In this way, the movie is like an American movie with the inevitable final chase scene.Still, a VERY witty film.",In Bruges
504,MrBlackAdder,Absolutely brilliant movie in every way!,10,17 January 2017,"This movie is everything I love about movies. It's got great acting, great characters, great story, great dialogue. It's nothing short of amazing. I haven't seen Farrell in a roll like this before, but he certainly shines. Going from being a brat, to coked up as all hell, to depressed in a matter of minutes and it's hilarious as well as heart breaking.Gleeson is fantastic in his role too! He plays a perfect mix of cold and calculating, still being sophisticated and also has a conscience of sorts.Every scene in this movie develops either character or story, and the story unfolds so flawlessly with every passing scene. Going from thinking Ray is just being an arrogant brat to realizing what he has done and why he's acting like he is is a truly fascinating journey, and you can't quite tell whether to laugh or be upset by it, sometimes doing a bit of both at once.The dialogues and delivery are truly perfect, and it leaves us with so many quotable lines about topics from saving someone you were going to kill from suicide and having a discussion with him about it afterwards to race wars with midgets. Sorry, ""Dwarves"". The wife telling Harry to bring ""the fellas"" as he leaves and him apologizing for calling her an inanimate object because he was upset brings so much depth to characters and their relationship only from a minute-long scene.

Good films are made at the presence of a human's mind or soul; masterpieces are made in integral presence of mind & soul. In Bruges is a film of the last kind. all of the characters in it - main or marginal - are memorable by their functions in the course of narration & as the story spreads ahead, roles of them which seemed at first marginal to the story, suddenly come miraculously up, fit as a part of a foreseen destiny.Just two main traits in the film that makes it an unforgettable piece of creation by human's mind & soul are:1-some mythological characters with nonnegotiable principles which they are fighting & dying for; alongside of a few earthly characters which living under the shadow of the first group's dominance. 2-a tinge of comedy - some sense of sitcom - mixed in overwhelming taste of tragedy. (Polytonal texture)Everything seems like an occult or symbolic story of undying creatures that have been sent on earth to teach some things transcendental to the humankind. It's a hypnotizing magical masterpiece.

Not for the squeamish as there's a lot of quite disgusting violence. Don't let anyone ""young"" see it as it's a bit too heavy for most people under 16 to handle.

The plot is simplistic yet very clever, and this is where its beauty lies. The Movie will definitely not be to everyone's tastes, and some of the Jokes / scenarios that the Colin and Brendan get themselves into are so far off the Do-Gooder Brigades PC scale, that they need to have a classification of there own, but if like me you can look past this and enjoy them in the context that they are in, then you will Love this movie.

Brutal murderers. And then starts the stupidity of the movie, which is, and this is something i really hate, the fact that for some reason, you're suppose to like those murderers, and follow them through the movie as if they were saints. The director doesn't waste any known trick in the book to make sure that those murderers would seem likable, sensitive, funny, and even charming, and that the audience would fall in love with them, laugh with them, and cry for them. Why? Don't ask me, but let me tell you this: If only they were the brutal, unlikable, unfunny, and not at all the charming murderers that they really are, this movie would have probably worked. But as it is, it's no more than a bloody fake. Fake, fake, fake. Only in one scene they act, if only for a moment, as the real murderers that they are, and that's probably the best scene in the movie. I wonder... Who said that you have to fall in love with the heroes, any kind of heroes, in a movie, rather than excepting them for what they really are and having to deal with them in an honest way? Probably a fool. Other than that, this film is all about who is going to shoot who, when will someone shoot someone else, and how will one shoot the other, or in other words, a totally faked stupidity.

512,piotr-ney,An excellent example of smart modern cinema,10,11 November 2009,"In Bruges is an impressive feature length debut by playwright Martin McDonagh. Its spot-on pace sparkles with intelligent dialogue and black humour. Within minutes, I felt I knew the principal characters, Irish hit men Ken and Ray (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell), for years, and felt drawn in like an invisible third protagonist to join them on their Leffe-fuelled strolls along the Gothic canals.The titular city functions more than a mere cinematographic backdrop. It evolves with the plot, becoming more otherworldly and menacing as the pitch of impending doom heightens, reaching its crescendo in the final scene as Ray stumbles into the living canvas of Bosch's Last Judgement.It appears obligatory for smart movies these days to reference cult cinema, and In Bruges does contain several such nods, including a recurring homage to Nic Roeg's Don't Look Now, itself referenced in the dialogue. This is does not unduly distract, merely reinforces McDonagh's anchorage in the fabric of unnerving European cinema.Many will principally remember this movie for its laugh-out-loud surrealism, such as the ketamine-stoned, racist dwarf. Yet beneath the buoyant dialogue and memorable set pieces lies a convincing morality tale. The choices and questions effortlessly posed here are no less serious than those in more self-conscious and ponderous recent redemption tales. I actually found myself pausing the movie at one point to ask myself what I would do in a situation.With Tarrantino firing blanks these days, I for one would be delighted to see McDonagh establish himself as the modern champion of smart, edgy cinema.",In Bruges
513,kvkk,Damn good 'Pretty badly messed up Job',9,5 September 2009,"'You've got to stick to your principles' says Harry, and he'd die for them, and he'd kill for them... Ray broke the rule and he has to die. And where else to let him die than at the 'Fairytale Town' called Bruges, a well preserved medieval city, where everybody has to have a nice time as it is everybody's thing. And who else to kill Ray than his partner Ken. This Academy nominated movie which gave 'Milk' a run for the money in the Original Screenplay category is an enticing experience of life and death struggle with British patented dark comic proportions and a hidden emotional roller-coaster in all. The dialogue between Ken and Ray is downright outrageous and mind blowing. Ray (Colin Farell) hates Bruges (Brugge in Belgium) even before he steps his foot out of the train while Ken (Brendan Gleeson) absolutely loves it. Ray ventures out feeling bored, we meet an assort of characters in the form of locals Eerik and Yuri, Canadian, American tourists, violent medieval art pieces, canals with boats, an American Dwarf actor, Dutch prostitutes and Chloe (Clemence Poesy), a girl who sells drugs on film sets. She gives him a respite from his dark haunting past, which eventually comes chasing him down, in the form of Harry (Ralph Fiennes), a boss of his and Ken's, when the latter not only failed to kill Ray, but also prevented him from committing suicide. Though not suitable for all ages due to explicit content regarding language, drug abuse, racism, it is an intense movie veiled by witty but dark humor, fantastic dialogue, beautiful locations. Must see.",In Bruges
514,matthew-ward-747-728944,I wanted to like this...,5,24 May 2010,"Hmm...This film had received such a lot of acclaim, I really wanted to follow suit and love it too.No doubt, it has some quotable gaffs - and the roguish Guy Richie-esquire characters certainly entertain - but I didn't even begin to engage in what turned out to be a thoroughly lukewarm bit of storytelling. The thing is, 'In Bruges' really WANTS to have charm. And it desperately wants to bear the chicness of finer British classics. I feel it fails on both accounts.Give it a rent if you're bored one night. But don't expect to emerge bedazzled, as some would have you believe.",In Bruges
515,dvid-odell,"Original, witty and surprisingly thoughtful",8,30 March 2013,"A superb quirk of a film that felt like an adaptation of a (very good) short story.I expected a macho gangster heist with crappy dialogue and a transparent plot - not at all what was delivered. Sure, it's gruesome in places, but it has got brains, heart, and some fantastic dialogue. It is hard to fault this film.This film was on my watch-list as it always appeared under ""other people who liked this also liked..."". I kept looking at it, thinking it looked a bit odd, but meaning to get round to watching it. So glad I finally did. If you are in the same position, just try it!",In Bruges

517,franceswagg,This was my favorite film of 2008,10,8 December 2012,"This was my favorite film of 2008. It's rare that a film can come along and affect you in a way that makes you laugh and makes you really connect with the struggles of the lead characters. This is exactly what In Bruges does, and it does it with such an unpretentious and dramatic flair. You really connect with each character and see why Colin Farell is perfect in his role, as the man child Ray, his tempo, comedic timing and childishness never overshadow his true feelings and he brings a lot of heart into it. Brendan Gleeson is mesmerizing as he plays an old hit-man facing a very hard decision and you really see him go back and forth. Ralph Fiennes almost steals the show as the foul mouthed, cold but with a human side mob boss. The supporting artists are even cast well, from the dwarf Jimmy, to the hotel owner Marie, to the arms dealer Yuri, they each play their parts believably and at the same time hilariously. However the star here is the screenplay, what effortlessly balances some of the juvenile humor and the hard hitting questions the movie arises. One of my favorite movies.",In Bruges

The acting was fine but the script was poor. The story was interesting but had too many clumsy plot devices. The whole ""love interest"" was just a set up to arm Ray. The sub-plot concerning the dwarf/midget/small person was pretty pointless too. I was expecting an intelligent thriller and got a really boring and over long film instead. Was it longer than the average movie? Maybe not but it did seem so. I was bored throughout and just wished they would kill each other and get it over with.If you have to see it then please wait for it to be shown on TV or borrow it from some poor fool who bought the DVD(me).

Collin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson's performances are first rate but it's Farrell's dialogue and his delivery of it that is truly amusing and for me makes the film along with Ralph Feinnes's nasty yet comically likable mob boss. Worth a mention also are two of the supporting actors Clemece Poesy as the very pretty Chloe and Jordan Prentice as troubled yet hilarious Jimmy. Tragic plot but with so many humorous characters and occurrences. See this film if you like comedy, see this film if you like drama and see this film if you like films. Beutifull!",In Bruges

It mentioned that In Bruges was a metaphor for purgatory, or hell, and I was intrigued. I wasn't disappointed. This was one of the best dark comedies I've ever seen. Funny, witty, intensely dark and harrowing, and I never knew what to expect. My favorite character in the movie was Ken (played well by Brendan Gleeson), the older hitman who we find out halfway through is a widower (still wearing his ring, and still mourning his late wife). The major theme in the movie is the gray areas of morality, and how there can be honor among thieves, or in this case hitmen.",In Bruges

Collin's role was way too exaggerated and concluded with him looking like a complete retard the whole way through the movie, the dialogue is very superficial and the plot-line is somewhat meddled, as if trying to elongate the story as much as humanly possible.

523,lishak-c,(Joe Meets Colin Farrell) on YouTube Video,10,17 January 2017,I watched this film when it came out in 2008 with a friend. And at the end we both said that was fantastic was it not. And I said I do not think I have seen a film like this for a long time as it was so good. In fact I liked the locations so much I have visited three times to Bruges and love the place. I am going for my birthday in April and can not wait. I got started in trying to get a sequel made as feel a story can be told. Have got back that no time soon does Martin McDonagh have plans for a sequel. But I saw a video of Colin Farrell saying {Joe Meets Colin Farrell To Talk The Lobster Harry Potter And A Sequel To In Bruges}. I hear Colin Farrell asked about who he could play and he says Ray In Bruges film. When asked about a sequel he says oh Brendan not ready. In my mind meaning as Brendan Gleeeson has been writing something else that he might be interested in writing a sequel. Martin McDonagh holds the writes if a film is done again. But I am sure as he knows Colin and Brendan well that just be what Colin Farrell meant in his comments. To show your interest please look at this you tube video. Any way I think Colin Farrell is the best performance he has ever given. And Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes are superb. Also ever one in the film give a really good performance. And Bruges itself comes off really well in the film.,In Bruges
524,wantensm,2 dwarfs and a shotgun,10,3 August 2019,"Hello mr mcdonagh, hello marty,I think you made a few nice movies and just saw Three billboards. Thank you for your cinematic evolvement or how should I call it. Every movie is getting better.
I played in your first movie, in Bruges but got cut out. I think you missed your first Oscar there, but sure your chimney will be filled with those shiny little men, with or without my help.There was one scene cut out of In Bruges where I was holding 2 dwarfs under shot while batteling each other.
I think that if I was born for acting, that is precisely what I dreamt of. Twin Peaks but weirder.
Let me recall upon my humble role. In the end there was a scene on the plaza with a kind of weird characters from a Jeroen Bosch scene. Who is from Holland, but thats is only a detail.This was way beyond the Game of Thrones Era when small peopLe became popular. Even as my role was called Apron Man, it had nothing to do with the Marvel Legacy. Spiderman and other cweirdos, fasten your seatbelts and eat my shorts... you never know when I ll do my come back.Anyways, I understand why you have cut the scene out. It would have been taken the rhythm out of the plot. Nothing to do with my acting of course and certainly not of the counter actors, of whom Chris, received an important role in a famous Dutch series. The othet guy has a nice job at a tele operator and I dated his niece. Who needs fiction anyways...Just to recall tou my availabilities. In Bruges is nice but you are doing better every time so let s agree that I can do a kind of Birdman kind of movie with Heath Ledger in mind.Yours trulyAPRON MAN",In Bruges

The music is well orchestrated, and fits the movie well. You really get a feeling how Bruge is as a small town with personality. But the thing that makes this movie is the characters.

Nothing difficult, no wit, just a slow movie with thugs, guns, girl(s) and drugs.As a Belgian however I visited Bruges multiple times. The spirit of Bruges is not as shown here. The cinematography makes it a 'desolate' medieval city (maybe it is for the characters) allthough in real life it is a poetical place, cultural warm and civilised. Not as cold as shown here, even in winter. For that, 6/10 because it is ok, I have seen worse, but it certainly isn't a high profile film.",In Bruges
535,jnt-4,Big disappointment,2,26 January 2009,"""In Bruges"" was a huge disappointment, especially considering the unending praise this movie has been drawing from critics and viewers alike.I thought it was very false, and contrived.The movie centers on two professional hit men from Ireland, rationalising what they do for a living, i.e. killing people for money, by telling themselves that most of the people they've killed weren't very nice anyway, so kinda had it coming/only got their comeuppance. At the same time, they do of course have very appropriate pangs of conscience about the few people they killed who may not have deserved it. Generally speaking I don't care for movies about contract killers (""Grosse Pointe Blank"" being another example) which depict their protagonists in a naïve, romanticised way: Yeah, here are these two paid killers, but don't be put off by what they do for a living, they're really quite friendly people, so long as you don't end up on their hitlist! In fact, even if you do end up on their hitlist, they are still going to be friendly to you, although they are going to have to kill you, but that's strictly business, nothing personal! There is a scene where one of them relates how he had to kill a man he wasn't paid to kill  the man just stood in his way trying to protect a relative who was on the assassin's hitlist. The scene turns into a mock argument about whether or not he shot the man in self-defence, with the two talking at cross points, or rather Colin Farrell's character pretending to be too obtuse to see the other guy's point. The scene is clearly meant to be hilarious. I had no inclination to smile.One thing I am really sick of in English-language movies (not only this one) is all these Continental European supporting characters with absolutely flawless English, in this case Colin Farrell's enormously annoying Belgian love interest. Not only do they never make any mistakes, they speak the language so brilliantly that they can hold their own in witty conversations with native speakers, firing from a sparkling repartee that includes puns on English words that I assume wouldn't work in their own language. How about making a movie for a change in which Belgians, Germans, Italians, etc. speak English the way they really do, i.e. BADLY? Of course, no explanation is ever given why they speak English so well. Usually one of the native-speaker characters just makes a stupid surprised face and says something like ""Wow, your English is really good"", and that's that. On to the next pun.Another thing I am tired of is all these regular people with superhuman courage in the face of extreme danger, in this case an extremely pregnant(!) hotel owner who never wavers for a second as she stands in the way of an armed madman, in defiance of the danger to her own life and that of her unborn baby. Right. If there was anybody in the real world who would really act this way, it wouldn't be courageous, it would be plain stupid.There is one scene of such colossal absurdity, I can't help but relate it. A man is first shot in the leg, then he hobbles down the winding stairs of a bell tower (albeit propped up by another man, to be fair), then he gets shot into the throat or maybe shoulder, then he drags himself back up the same winding staircase (this time without the help of the other man), then  once at the top  he drags himself onto the parapet of said bell tower to stand erect(!) upon the parapet before hurling himself down. There is a massive cloud of blood as he hits the ground. I won't reveal what happens next, let's just say the guy is of an impressive resilience.Almost as absurd is the ending which has the five leads all in the same place at the same time, so the movie can conveniently deal with them one after the other until all emotional and outer conflicts are neatly resolved, in a way that could only have been contrived by a director who comes from theater.I am giving this movie a liberal 2 out of 10 stars, the lowest rating I have given any movie since Terry Gilliam's ""Brothers Grimm"". If you want to see an honest movie about a paid assassin, watch the original ""Day of the Jackal"". That movie too centered on a man who killed for a living, but unlike ""In Bruges"" it never tries to coax the viewer into sympathising with its protagonist. Instead, it deals with its subject matter-of-factly: he's a contract killer, ruthless and despicable.",In Bruges

The dialogue is outstanding and the acting performances are fairly good as well.

The characters are interesting and intelligently written and the performances by Farrel, Fiennes and Gleeson manage to do them justice.The symbolism you can discern if you pay close attention adds an extra layer to this movie that gives it an edge over other black comedies.

It has stayed with me all day.Like the song in your head that wont go away.I guess from the look of it that it was shot on some species of digital camera...(I saw from the credits they used an Arri, but there were credits for Delux and a neg cutter..?..!) It would have made sense to have shot this on HD as a wet night in a city lit by practicals cries our for it. The photography was wonderful, not in that it delivered a slide show of gorgeous frames, but that you felt you were there. It wasn't there to show off but to drive the story along, part of the narrative.You could feel your warm top coat around you as you sat in the sidewalk café, you could taste the cold strong beer and the cool night air on your face. Mr McDonah is a vivid talent and for a feature film débutant shows an amazing sureness of touch. of course he has already won an Oscar for his short film, obviously a good training ground! I'll light a candle for him that his next film is just as good but completely different.Then we will know a new star has risen.(Oh that difficult second album!)The writing, as in any film, is the most important element and the bizarre, strangely formal, dialogue, especially Harry's ,was to hear screen writing at its electrifying best.The samurai-like code of honour of the killers just added to the grown up fairy-tale feel. Towne and Tarantino on a good day. As actors Gleason and Fiennes were, as ever, beyond criticism,simply faultless.Everyone who writes about Colin Farrell begins with the disclaimer that they are 'not a fan', well I guess he's not the most likable of people. But his performance in this was pure gold.Spectacular. Part Dougal Mcguire (Father Ted) and part Stan Laurel yet convincingly tough. The brutal violence had a real Tom and Jerry slapstick to it and was perfectly judged. As were the accompanying quotable lines""Thats for John Lennon yer fokin yankee khont"" as he punches out the obnoxious fellow diner who, despite sitting in the smoking section, complains about their smoking...we have ALL met him..if you haven't then you ARE him! Once again the director has shown himself true officer material to get such a wonderful performance from a difficult, but gifted actor.""OK Colin today you're going to karate-chop a dwarf."" (I think there was a nod to ""Living in Oblivion"" there.)Like 'The Birds' this movie sets out as a comedy but ends in a glimpse of Hell,There is a real medieval Catholic perception of sin, guilt and retribution running through this like the words in a stick of rock ( to quote Graham Greene, another obvious influence)Like the final journey to Hell as portrayed by Heronimous Bosch,this film too is a haunting, disturbing, dazzling work of of art.",In Bruges
544,andybeddall,The best scriptwriter since the Golden Age,10,12 July 2021,"I recently revisited this film after a few years. The performances and direction are excellent, but it is the script which makes the film. McDonagh's reputation as one of the two great playwrights for the West End (alongside Stoppard) has clearly carried over to the script for this film, with the sharp witty dialogue last seen in the Golden Age allied with the most satisfying of storylines, bringing all the strands to a convincing conclusion. Yes, there is violence and yes, the film is not for the over sensititive - but anyone who knows McDonagh from work such as The Lieutenant of Inishmore would know what to expect. If you want the Brady Bunch don't watch a McDonagh film. And to round it all off Ralph Fiennes gives the most hilarious send up of Ben Kingsley (in his Sexy Beast persona) that is possible.McDonagh is a solid gold certified genius and this film announced a new God in the film pantheon.",In Bruges
545,jacobgalama,worst movie in a long time,1,4 August 2008,"Yes indeed, the worst I have seen in a long time. In that respect it is a classic. Every mistake a director can make is made in this one. Martin McDonagh should not be allowed to make cinema-movies, and he should stick to short ones. Bad acting, bad dialog, bad story, bad choice of music, silly humor, badly performed slapstick. All the characters seem out of place, even a minor character like the usher in the church tower or the landlady in the hotel.It starts off in a hotel hide-out where two hire-killers have a casual conversation, when one of them strikes a subject the other does not wish to have mentioned, his killing of a child. The way this is brought up is a give-away to the bad acting throughout the movie, and it continues to be bad and it never stops. I was even horrified at the slap-stick moment with the fat American tourist-character. Why and how did the director decide to put in such a scene at all? The acting-out in the restaurant with the Canadian tourist? If this was supposed to be funny, then, apart from the terrible performance by Colin Farrell, where am I supposed to start and stop laughing? I can continue but I will not.You think while watching that Brendan Gleeson will at some point make up for the others complete failure to be plausible, but no.

546,cjrj1088,A cult classic in the making,9,12 December 2008,"Colin Farrel and Brendan Gleeson work perfectly together as characters with opposing minds. The performance of Colin Farrel reminds me of his great and under appreciated work in Phonebooth. The beginning may appear slow to many, but it is the cause for it becoming popular upon others. The constant and offensive dialogue by Farrel will cause many laughs and spark the interest of any movie lover. Gleeson's role further enhances everything that Farrel does in the film. Ralph Fiennes plays his role perfectly and is compatible with the other characters.A person choosing to watch this film will be delightfully surprised and enjoy every second. The cast mends together fantastically and there is not a single character that doesn't cause an eyebrow to be raised.

It was not only very funny but you were able to connect with the characters in a way you didn't think you would. The plot was def. very interesting and kept my attention the whole way through. Only real problem I had with the movie was that it was a little bit too long, but it didn't take away from anything. I should also say that I'm not a huge Colin Farrell fan, but after this movie I believe that he has proved that he can hold his own with the other leading men out there. I thought there were some beautiful moments that they captured on film where you see him dealing with his characters inner demons.

But billing this as a comedy has to be the height of false advertising. The killing of the child, the shooting and the suicide off the bell tower, the unrelenting, unnecessary multiple shootings of Ray in the final scenes - just too, too much.

He doesn't say a word but you can tell exactly what he is thinking.There are other scenes, for example when he decides to accept the situation he is in at the moment, and you can actually read his thoughts with no words being spoken.In the scene when the dwarf fails to even notice him you can see disappointment, resolution, and finally acceptance and dismissal of the situation.",In Bruges

On one level it's a crime thriller - at another, a morality play and yet another, an awfully funny (in parts) black comedy. And yet it's even more than that. Sumptuously filmed in Bruges, nothing is wasted in this intricately crafted plot. Nothing that is introduced is irrelevant to the whole story - including the dwarf and the film set. And for a while I was wondering the significance of this, yet it all comes together at the end, which in itself played like a dream sequence. The fulcrum around which the whole movie revolves - the death of a young boy during a hit, is introduced subtly. And then the acting is equally superb. Everyone excels. The only slightly false note is played at the end which is why I give it a 9 but that is a minor quibble in this thought-provoking masterpiece I can happily see again.",In Bruges
554,DiegoOlivero,"I know I'm awake,but i feel like i am in a dream....",10,17 February 2009,"Being this the first feature film of recognized play maker Martin McDonagh i did not really knew what to expect. To be honest i only knew that Colin Farrel was in this and that Martin McDonagh's short Six shooter won an academy award(If you watched and enjoyed In Bruges i recommend this short). I was not much of a fan of Farrel, and i have to admit this movie changed my whole perception of him,i can see him now like a true actor.The movie itself it's packed with a lot of dark humor,also with action and drama. Some scenes can be very touching and other ones can be pretty funny too.Wonderfully shot in the outdoors of Bruges (In Belgium) and with flawless script and direction. The cast is perfectly chosen. Being Farrel and Gleeson two irish hit mens working in London, and after a job went bad and told to hide in Bruges. Poésy playing a local custom and builds a relationship with Farrel's character. And finally Ralph Fiennes plays the ultimate mastermind of this London criminal group.This movie is truly one of 2008's cinema gems and i highly recommend it for anyone looking for a very well made film.",In Bruges
555,Mikejove,Foreshadow? Check. Inciting Force? Check. Conflict? Check. etc.,7,17 July 2008,"A ""popcorn-drama"" is what comes to mind. This comedic-drama exhibits all the essential theatrical-elements to create a ""good story"". That being said, it seemed much of the storyline was ""forced"", meaning, several scenes seemed to happen for-the-sake of exploring that particular ""literary element"". The result of this is an exhaustive view of each character, making them seem rather one-sided, which isn't necessarily bad, but I prefer deeper, more dynamic characters..The story itself was well-told, dialogue was entertaining, acting was decent, but I had higher expectations for this one. To sum it up, this movie was, simply, ""simple"".",In Bruges
556,Michael-Giuffre-2,What a Great Movie,8,7 February 2008,"I've used IMDb for years but have never felt the urge to post a review until now. I had the pleasure of attending an advanced screening of this movie in NYC last night to which Colin Farrell attended. I bought the screening tickets just wanting to bring my fiancé to see some celebrities in person while not knowing much about the movie. I figured it would be a ""hard-to-understand"" foreign, indie film whose humor would be lost on a ""dumb American."" However, the truth was absolutely the opposite. My hard-to-please fiancé agreed.The movie is a bit slow for the first half but it's entirely necessary to set the mood and the contrast between that and the second half. That's all I'll say so as not to spoil anything. It is really a great movie. There's comedy, beautiful cinematography, and awesome action scenes, albeit scattered throughout and absent at times when the viewer may be growing weary. I'd highly recommend seeing this movie. It's definitely worth the price of a movie ticket while most of the crap out there these days isn't worth the cost of the paper they print the tickets on.Let us all know what you think after you see it.",In Bruges
557,kuenne,Very entertaining,10,18 February 2008,"The movie is a dark comedy. Dialogs between Gleeson, Farrell and Fiennes are hilarious. If you like movies like Pulp Fiction or similar you should see this one. The bloody stuff is not too much, just right. And the pictures of Bruges add even some romantic touch to it. Overall, excellent writing, excellent acting (I even revised my opinion about Colin Farrell, whom I didn't like to much before). The plot is twisted but easy to follow. One last warning though, if you get easily offended by racist or midget humor you should probably stay away. I didn't find anything offending but others might see it differently. The Irish dialect gave me some minor trouble understanding everything at first (English is only my second language) but I got used to it over the run of the movie.",In Bruges
558,pixie2-1,Two hit men hide out in Bruges and come to learn a very hard truth,7,13 April 2008,"This is a brilliant film, the story and scenery are great, but it has been pirated on a camcorder which the user DID NOT seem to know how to focus. If you want this to copy to disc, i suggest you do NOT use this copy. I would recommend waiting for this film to be released on DVD.There are a couple of glaring errors I noticed on this film, mainly the bell tower has a cage around the bells to prevent visitors from falling down the shaft or from touching the bells themselves. The bells in that tower are irreplaceable antiques. Also, the steps to the tower are too narrow to allow well-padded people, like one of the lead actors, to be able to climb them easily. Also, at the end, another character runs down them, which is dangerous and foolhardy, as you cannot place your entire foot on the steps without half your foot hanging over.",In Bruges
559,kathspaceman,Quite Funny,7,22 April 2008,I did enjoy this movie made me chuckle and Colin Farral was very good made me laugh. Ralph Fiennes was good as the Baddie. The setting in bruges was ideal although i wouldn't want to visit there. Story did get slow in parts but the laughs kept coming so padded the story out. The dwarf man was a added bonus to the film and in end made the story line come together. The film was the correct length and never got bored. A lot of near the bone comments which the film makers got away with in the context it was used. This is a sure hit in the box office and Colin Farrells best work to date. I may even go and see it again or wait for DVD.,In Bruges
560,adam-sewell-1,The best film I've seen this year. Made me want to visit Bruges - but not that much,9,24 April 2008,"Where have all the black comedies gone? Well, we just found one of them and it's really good. If you'd seen the trailer, you might well be expecting something entirely different, perhaps a bit of a comedy farce, but please don't be put off. Wonderful characterisation, fantastic performances, real surprises, sublime dialogue, funny and beautifully tragic, what else can you ask for? Colin Farrell is absolutely superb, bringing life to a character at a level that is surely beyond the call of a man who has 'made it' in Hollywood. To compliment Farrell without acknowledging the other main characters is to sell them short, so Brendan Gleeson, the rather beautiful Clémence Poésy and Ralph Fiennes, here's to you. Please, go and see it because we need more films like this",In Bruges
561,macpun,Film of the year so far.,10,22 June 2008,"Just an excellent film. Absolutely hilarious from start to finish, Colin Farrell is so mindbendingly off colour in this flick. Some of the things that come out of his mouth had tears rolling down my face I was laughing so hard and at the same time the movie has some real raw emotion, that almost had me in tears for a completely different reason. Brendon Gleeson turns in a great performance and Ralph Feinnes is hardcore. Martin Mcdonagh is a brilliant writer and director and look forward to seeing what he comes up with next. There is something for everyone(no kids) in this flick: some serious gangsterism, pints, sex, drugs,drama, and a midget in a schoolboy uniform...what else could you ask for in a film. I couldn't recommend a movie higher... This may be the best film I've seen all year, second only to Ironman possibly",In Bruges
562,kutay99,I want more films from McDonagh,10,16 April 2009,"This is my first comment on IMDb after visiting it nearly every day for two years. I felt the need to write something because when I found out that this was the only long film of McDonagh, I felt rather disappointed. I was entranced by the sophistication of the film. I'm a filmaholic who watches at least one film everyday. What was so extraordinary with In Bruges that allured me so much? Was it the music? The city of Bruges? The characters? Or the humor which does not use cheap jokes? I really could not answer that question to myself, although I am a 4. year psychology student. I also feel a need to say something about Colin Farrell. I have seen some of his previous films. In all of them he tries to draw a male charisma like many pert Hollywood actors do. But in this film he becomes a real human being with all his weaknesses. Now, I started to respect him as a successful and modest actor. I hope McDonagh is reading these comments; because I really want many more films from him. I will be following you McDonagh! Of course, there will be some people who do not like your work, but if you continue to shoot your films in your original way you will have your fans like me. Thank you very much for all your efforts so far.",In Bruges

I often refer to the reviews on IMDb, but never quite felt the need to comment on the movies I have watched. In Bruges, it seems, is not very well known. But it is definitely the best movie I have seen in a while.I was told that it was a witty movie about two hit men and that's about all I really knew about the movie itself. I'd never seen the trailer or anything. I must admit that Bruges is a beautiful place and the cinematography excellently brought out the finer points of the little town. I'd have to say that it was slow in the beginning and left me in a state of curiosity, but things all worked themselves into place eventually and the movie itself was more emotional than I had expected. I loved the Irish humour and it was a good balance for the emotional strings that the movie managed to pull.I've told everyone I've talked to that they should watch this movie. It's simply that good.",In Bruges
564,ladonnafe,factual errors,8,22 June 2008,"I've just seen the movie, and being from Belgium (Flanders), I'd like to add some factual errors:First of all there's a quite important scene, set in a restaurant, when a fight breaks out between ""the Canadian"" and Ray, because the Canadian comments on Chloé smoking... Smoking in restaurants has been banned since January 2006Second of all, Bruges (Brugge) is a city in Flanders. Flanders being the dutch-speaking part of Belgium... Yet the locals seem to have a french accent... except for Marie and the ticket man (they're both Flemish actors) Yuri is a Waloon actor (Walonie is the other part of Belgium, where people speak french), Erik is from Brussels (also speaks French) and Chloé ís from France...",In Bruges
565,jayhurstart,Of Mice and Hit Men.,10,22 June 2008,"A lot of reviews see fit to give a thorough plot summary, so I'll just talk b*llocks instead.In Bruges is a grown up gangster film not because it uses the word f*ck very often, though it does, because even a child can type 'f*ck' repetitively into a screen play and judging by most recent gangster films, with a few notable exceptions, that wouldn't be too far from the truth.In Bruges is a grown up genre film not because it hangs out in galleries and cathedrals like a tapestry woven by Brueghel's mistress from blood, sin, and judgement. Though it does.In Bruges is a black comedy for grown ups not because it consciously satisfies our skulking childishness, our 'incorrect' urge to lash out at convention , say f*ck the lot 'o ya's, fist someone in the mouth for good measure and then offer a fast talking and wickedly funny apology. And it does all that too.In Bruges is grown up cinema because despite being sexy, fun and stylish, it is emotionally literate. Is that allowed?The complexity of Martin McDonagh's screen play is manifold, developing and delineating character through dialogue as much as action. Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrel inhabit their characters with equal and at times forceful skill, displaying flawless comic timing and sensitivity. Together they breathe 'real life' into the hyperbolic corpse of a bloated genre that never quite realised it died some time ago. McDonagh's characters realise too late they've been c*nts, one way or another, and far too late, begin to grow. Characters with history, in emotional distress, barely conscious or all too aware. They do what we might in their shoes. And as they trace the outline of their own destruction in lines of cocaine or spilled beer, their conceit, self loathing, compassion or stubbornness lays them all bare. There is a cost for all of them, characters on a human scale, acting out their tragedy in recognisable terms. In Bruges is as morally instructive as it is dramatically satisfying, almost becoming a medieval mystery play in the setting of the title.Finally In Bruges is a dangerously perfect fusion of plot, meaning and story. Ripples of understanding run back and forth across the surface of the experience, hinting at the themes which swim powerfully beneath. A film this genuinely startling doesn't happen very often.",In Bruges

Be prepared to view a comical nostalgic view of Europe. The bad- guy comical sense of humor works well for my light hearted sensational interests. This movie entertains and places you in another anxious context that will surprise you. I believe this was not just well directed entertainment but well written as well. I'd go action, comedy and crime... Sometimes talent such as Colin Farrell rises to new levels because of his fellow cast. I think this is what went on In Bruges. Take a look at this movie and give it your honest review.",In Bruges
567,kivvidotca,Fun but Lacking,7,29 June 2008,"As much as I like British movies, the cast, and black comedies, In Bruges left me unsatisfied. It wasn't enough that Colin Farrell gave one of his best performances since Tiger Land, and that Brendan Gleeson was casted superbly for the supporting role. The plot progresses enjoyably in the pleasing scenery of Bruges and the relationship between the two contract killersRay and Ken, played by Farrell and Gleeson respectivelyis amusing. But that's just it. The plot is enjoyable, not stirring or inspiring; and the dialogue is amusing, not funny or witty. All in all, it's an enjoyable flick that's fun to watch, but that's it.",In Bruges

However, sitting outside in a cafe that time of the year drinking beer as seen in the film adds to the charm but in fact, is a bit much even for hearty Europeans.The movie was excellent and a pleasant surprise for me. Colin Farrell and Brendon Gleason were perfect together, but then Gleason is spot on in almost every film he does; e.g. Gangs of New York.Other than having some difficulty understanding Farrell's Irish brogue, this movie was a pleasant surprise for me. I thought it combined the right combination of humor and reality making the plot line more convincing. I particularly liked the role of the pregnant hotel owner; friendly, business like and feisty. A woman of character.FN",In Bruges

It should be in the Drama and Crime genre only. I didn't find this film amusing at all. It had the slowest start in the history of all films. When it came about half way through the action factor increased slightly. Now i can see how some people would think its funny but, its just on rare ocations that funniness occurs. The film is VERY predictable, i mean there are just a couple of actions made that came unexpected, but everythingelse is just so god damn predictable. Anyways this wasn't a film for me ""OBVIOUSLY"" but im sure a lot of people like it. Its something a bit unordinary and fresh, but so slow that i almost stopped watching it.And i had a hard time hearing what everybody said, even Colin was hard to understand a times.",In Bruges
570,alexbrooks1,Surprisingly entertaining,9,18 August 2008,"When 'In Bruges' was first released, I originally didn't pay much attention to it, dismissing it (in a very stereotypical and naive fashion) as an under-the-radar box-office flop. How wrong I was.The film begins by gradually introducing the film's setting and characters; Ray, here played by Colin Farrell, initially has very little idea where or what Bruges is, or what its culture and traditions entail. Therefore this helps the audience to identify with his character, in that he is struggling to understand his current situation and how to act. Ken (Brendan Gleeson) seems to take the role of mentor at first, however as the film progresses so does his relationship with Ray, finally arriving at a point where they have a mutual friendship.To me this film seemed to be more of an action film sprinkled with dark and comic humour, rather than a comedy film with action fitted in; the second half of the film seems to reflect the former. The tone of the film shifts entirely, transforming what was once a rather light-hearted exploration of the city and the characters, into a dark, relentlessly-paced endgame.The acting from both Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson is spot-on, not only settling into their characters well but humanising them; Farrell plays the role of lovable rogue Ray who's busy wrestling with his conscience, whilst Gleeson portrays a middle-aged, world-weary hit-man who'd rather hand in his gun in favour of sightseeing and Belgian culture. A star turn from Ralph Fiennes also, as a truly intimidating Harry Waters.Overall, a very well-written and superbly handled piece of film-making, proving once more that quality movies do not have to include bucket-loads of CGI effects and over-the-top shootouts and car chases to impress.",In Bruges

Having regard to the soundtrack, you start off with a depressive tone..and it never actually stops.. Also, with the characters constantly whining about their current location, the film never seems to make you feel comfortable. But the film touches us all, through having those little every-day awkward situations. The film is depressing, but it will make you laugh..and in the end, you will feel like you just witnessed one really great movie, even tho' you still have to shake off the depression, that little seed of joy will end up blossoming some time later. =)",In Bruges
572,pd_deziel,One of the Best Films of the Year,10,29 December 2008,"Where to begin on this film? ""In Bruges"" is simply the most original films that I have seen in a long while. Martin McDonagh has written a hilarious dark comedic adventure. The story is very intriguing, but the characters are shear genius, and they are improved with the perfect cast.Many people will pass this up on these bases: I've never heard of it; It is a British film; and Colin Farrel is in it.I am openly admitting that before I saw this film, I did not care for Colin Farrel and I was not a fan of his acting. He redeems himself in this role. His deep and comedic portrayal of his character cannot be missed, not to mention Brendan Gleeson's astounding work and Ralph Fiennes doing one hell of a performance. Even the smaller characters are so very interesting.This film is a must see! Don't miss out on ""In Bruges""!",In Bruges

If I could erase my movie memory and watch this again I would do so in a flash!It has witty comedy, beautiful cinematography and well, Colin Farrell. 10 out of 10.",In Bruges
574,kwild83,A comic noir worthy of several viewings,9,20 January 2009,"Brilliantly written and shot, this dark, un-PC tale in painfully funny while keeping its unsettling undertones. Each role is played distinctively well and the character interaction is most entertaining and impressive, even Farrell, who surprised me in several very dramatic scenes. The films cinematography captures Bruges with excellent scenery while close ups of the characters immerse the viewer. A subtle, soft piano score follows throughout the film while the suspense scenes offer great orchestration. I must agree with many that although Gleeson shines with warmth and Farrell proves himself worthy of acting, Fiennes steals the show as the incredibly rude, witty and deadly antagonist. Yes, In Bruges is a vulgar and mean spirited tale but offers a genuine viewing experience for those not squeamish to continual harsh language and bloody action. Definitely watch this film and take from it what you will.",In Bruges

A different kind of role for Collin Farrel which he performs charismatically. For my money, Brendan Gleeson steals the show, in this film he is both a gentle and warm father figure as well as a hysterical best friend. Ralph Fiennes' is very funny as a London gangster, a role that he should be playing more of.The only reason it doesn't get 10/10 is because the changes of tone are way too quick and some of the smaller roles disappear when we want to see more of them.What we have here is one of the darkest comedies ever.",In Bruges

An European movie shot in Europe with a good old James Bond flavor.We barely have British movies where we live, and to tell the truth we didn't know they have a film industry that would not just take the state subsidies and play in a Festival to resume the usual non-Hollywood movie lifetime.Well known actors hiding in the city of Bruges, playing hit men on the lurk , waiting for directions, arguing each other and the ubiquitous romance with a local cute girl.Farrell's is acting of Real life Farrell and thats a role that suits him at his best. It was such a surprise that the comedy is dark , very dark, and not what we use to see these days , what it lacks is a good argument.A little more reflecting the euro life would've been a bonus, we don't have the chance of seeing much socialist Europe with an overvalued currency , excellent health care system and that. The stereotype portrayed of Americans is a must see. A good effort portraying Europe from within Europe with European sense of ( dark ) humor and that's it , don't expect much more. The screenplay is excellent, just hope to see movies like this with more content in the future.",In Bruges

The setting is beautiful, it show's how cool old European cities like Bruges actually are. Might inspire some British people to see other European countries than Spain when they go on holiday. 5. It has a dwarf in it. 6. The dwarf is not like any other dwarfs in movies. 7. Ralph Fiennes 8. The portrayal of American tourists which was not too far fetched ;)People who watch dubbed version's of this or a subtitled version won't and say it's crap, or people who are confused and angry because they didn't get it, shouldn't be allowed to vote or submit comments and thus make people who are not sure miss this gem.",In Bruges

Some others a depressive and harmless as a kitty person.I can't stop watching every face he shows, every dialogue he gives, and action he performs.Indeed, he must have a 10-stars performance award.Brendan Gleeson has always played wise,experienced men.He showed fascinated and interested by the culture and architecture of Bruges throughout the movie and tried to influence his partner as well. Seen as a sad and sometimes boring person by him.Ralph Fiennes really looked irritated(not to mention pis... off) in this one, and he is really suitable for that part.To sum up, I highly recommend this movie If you want to have a great time of fun and a hilarious experience.",In Bruges

I'm sure I'll come back to these films again and again. In Bruges though is the most compelling and most polished of the three with the four main players in the film, director and leading actors almost showing off they're mastery of their art if not quiet reaching film perfection, for me its film entertainment perfection...

580,edward_beer123,Loved every minute of it,10,22 February 2010,At first glance of the DVD case of In Bruges i didn't think much of it.But by the end of the film i have just one thing to say that is: one of the best films i've ever seen.The story is a great mix of humour and Darkness about two hit men hiding out in Bruges (it's in Belgium) who come to terms with their past and death.This is the best film so far with Colin Farrel who plays the young hit-man and Gleeson is superb as the more experienced of the two. Also Ralph Finnes is great as the foul mouthed gang leader who's out to level the scores. And the rest of the cast is brilliant such as Yuri the yoga gun salesmen and Jimmy the racist Dwarf.All in all watch this film and make your own mind up but i loved every minute of it.,In Bruges
581,girish-sahani,In Bruges - One of the most intelligent movies of all times!!,10,21 February 2011,"This movie has lots of amazing lessons: 1. Shows how criminals can have conscience too and how far they can go to preserve their moral principles. 'You've got to stick to your principles'.2. Importance of being frank and honest about yourselves: No hypocrisy. No-one lies about their profession, even the prostitute. The dwarf rejects Ken's compliment about his 'girlfriend'.3. How two people in the same profession can be so different: Ken and Ray are interested in completely different things.Ken in tourism and Ray in midgets.4. How biases can affect your life negatively: Ray was so biased against the city even before visiting that he couldn't enjoy the sights. Similarly the American tourists were so biased against ken (because rob had called them elephants) that they didn't heed to his advice not to visit the bell-tower and the guy had a heart-attack.5. Importance of not imposing one's beliefs on others: Scene in church between Ken and Ray where ken is super-excited about the church's artifact but Ray just says 'Do i have to (see it)?'.6. Actions have consequences: Ray has to get off the train for beating the Canadian.7. People like the bell-tower attendant are everywhere e.g. in government organizations. Strictly by the book and don't have any leeway for human exigencies.Cinematography is amazing. Music is amazing too. A Must watch!!",In Bruges
582,bluto88,A #@&%ing Great Time!!,7,12 August 2008,"I have to start this one off by saying this isn't a movie to take home for Grandma to enjoy. In Bruges starring Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes is a well played dark comedy for those who relish the poetic use of obscenities. It is a filth-laden film that unapologetically abuses every word your mom wishes wasn't in the dictionary. When watching this movie you are quick to realize that the over use of foul language is simply one aspect of the comedy that writer/director Martin McDonagh uses as a niche to carve out his piece of the film world. For me, this was just the tip of all the fun In Bruges has to offer.Winner of an Academy Award in 2006 for his short film Six Shooter (also starring Gleeson), celebrated British playwright McDonagh's first feature length film is hopefully a glimpse into a bright future of film-making. For In Bruges, much like Six Shooter, McDonagh uses his writing talents to tell a comical story through a dark and twisted sense of humor. In addition, with a shock of ultra violence within a not too violent film, it is sure to make all fans of foul words and blood scream for joy.It is difficult to offer a comparison for In Bruges, such as if you like that one, you'll like this one sort of thing. I would however put it in the same genre as Tarantino films, Guy Ritchie's Snatch and Lock, Stock, & Two Smoking Barrels, Boondock Saints, and Very Bad Things. This whole genre of modern day melodramas are films that use a bit of extreme violence with extreme language all perpetuated by extremely bad decisions. Then, to top it all off we the audience are meant to view these things as a comedy. I love it! The story of In Bruges is of two hit men (Farrell and Gleeson) that are sent to the city of Bruges in Belgium to sit tight and await new orders from their boss (played by Fiennes). Bruges is a simple historic little town, and no place for the likes of these two. A skewed view of a code of honor places the two hit men in a violent battle with their employer, and when the past catches up with them the mayhem ensues.Again, this film isn't for everyone. A person near and dear to me said it best: ""some people just can't see past the #@%&"". If you're lucky enough to qualify as being not one of these people, then run out and get your copy of In Bruges today, and #@%&ing enjoy it!",In Bruges
583,Mary-Castle,very dark comedy,5,20 August 2012,"What I liked about this movie was the photography of the city, Bruges.It is quite beautiful, both day and night scenes. The acting of the main characters Ken and Ray was good. I found myself feeling a bit of sympathy for them. There were some scenes that had real comedy and I found myself laughing a couple of times. I think the plot could have been better developed. I'm not clear on what message the writer of the script was trying to set forth. Strangely this movie is staying in my mind so I think that is why I felt compelled to write this review. What I disliked was the excessive violence. There was too much blood and gore. This could have been so much better. The ending was a great disappointment.",In Bruges
584,saxman-802-894313,Excellent black comedy....,8,27 July 2010,"I would call this a black comedy .....it contains some very dark subject matter that won't appeal to everybody, but it's also different than anything else I've ever seen - thought provoking, and yet funny at the same time. My kind of movie! The musical score is quite excellent.Production values are generally good, though it's obviously not a big budget feature. However the intellectual content more than makes up for any lack of big screen special effects or opulent sets. The two main characters (Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson) turn in compelling performances that convince the viewer that this not a movie, but a documentary of a real event.Overall, I highly recommend it for anybody who enjoys thought provoking cinema, and doesn't mind if it's a bit on the dark side.",In Bruges

It's kind of like a Tarrantino movie but with a totally different touch to it. It has very good depth, is very funny and still feel cozy despite the brutality in the movie. In the beginning it's still and beautiful and the character development is really nice. Then the heat turns up and the movie goes super exciting and it kind of feels like you are inside the movie. I'm really surprised by this masterpiece, wasn't expecting this much of the movie. I really hope Martin McDonagh makes more beautiful movies like this one in the future!",In Bruges
586,yoxhilarious,An Underrated Phenomenal Film,9,10 December 2010,"In Bruges: a movie containing gangsters, love, dark humor, and many deaths. Yet it is beautifully crafted to make all of these aspects fit perfectly. Martin McDonagh, the writer and director, interestingly enough did not start off his screenplay with the plot of two hit-men hiding out after a ""rookie"" messes up royally. McDonagh started off with the idea to film something, anything in Bruges; discovering that although it may be beautiful to go to which Ken's character portrays (and certainly after watching this movie for the seventh time tonight, I definitely want to) or it may be the most boring place on Earth, as Ray's character portrays. Colin Farrell was absolutely phenomenal in this movie, and certainly his best film. He himself confessed that it was the best script he has ever read. He portrayed his character so well, that even though on paper he is a hit-man who accidentally kills a little six year old boy, you grow to love and sympathize for. All of the characters in this film were perfect for their roles, and I loved all of them (minus the ""dim-dims"" guy). This is definitely not your typical gangster movie, and truthfully the first time I watched this I didn't even necessarily view them as gangsters. It shows that even the most inhumane of jobs can contain some of the most innocent and confused people. And, there is something about the ending which I fall in love with every time I watch it. It is an ending that is not at all happy but again shows some hope and honor in the world. From a dark comedy to a grim end, this movie is unique, hilarious, and very very well done.",In Bruges
587,Kyle-Gordon,Simple the best,9,18 May 2016,"Did you just watch Fargo and are now left wanting for something equally as dark and funny? Look no further. In Bruges is the tale of a a depressed hit-man who is granted the ""opportunity"" to visit Bruges a town known for his history and one which he hates. He stumbles upon a no name midget actor who ends up interfering with his local love interest, a local groupie who ends up trying to rob him. Though more interested in his companionship she forgoes her fiduciary pursuits in older to pursue her suicidal love. Meanwhile our protagonist has been ordered dead by his boss for reasons (unmentioned, spoilers). All in all this is a dark comedy with ample surprises and a witty script. 9/10 would watch again.",In Bruges
588,henkstubbe,Why is everybody so positive about this movie?,3,7 December 2014,"The movie has been described as having good black humor, but it hasn't. It's so superficial and utterly insulting minorities without any humorous twist, that there isn't something to laugh about. There's not even a little nice movie story line, only standard character developments, no new message the movie wants to give us, and you're stuck for half an hour even before the film plot really starts.Another annoying part of the movie is the action scenes. It's totally unbelievable you won't get hit by a pistol from 3-5 yards. And so it goes on...Apparently it is or was cool to like this movie. I say, don't waste your time on this.",In Bruges

If anyone has seen ""The Sopranos"" this movie's end is stupid. If you love classic 30's and 40's Hollywood ending then you would love this movie when a fellow survives a bloody gun shot then throws himself off a FREAKING CATHEDRAL and lives long enough to give the man he was supposed to kill enough information to live after seeing the first 2/3 of the movie....

Simply blew my mind off. Dark and indirect humor. Superb making. Its the story of two contact killer working under the same shade. The most attracting thing about this movie is the conscience these people hold inside. Even the notorious villein has a strong bit of conscience inside. Another catchy thing is that it brings out a lot of subject to think about for the audience. Unpredictable and kinda Shakespearean ending. All in all one of the best movies I have ever seen.

592,praveenr_big,On Raglan Road.. In Bruges,10,8 September 2014,"All I could muster to say after watching In Bruges was 'Nothing'. Literally Dumb stuck on how brilliant this movie was. Read quite a few reviews complaining about soundtrack not in sync with the story line, but for me that was mesmerizing, What can be better than the 'On Raglan Road' by 'The Dubliners' for that particular scene - ""DO NOT WANT TO PUT SPOILERS HERE"", But that scene stole the show. Colin Farrell - His best performance so far, Quirky yet emotional. Brendan Gleeson - Brilliant would be an understatement for his portrayal of Ken. Ralph Fiennes - I now cannot imagine anyone as Harry but him. The Message he leaves with the Motel Owner ""Receptionist"" was hilariously accusing.STARS of the movie.Story - Have never seen any movie with such a story this for me has raised the bar for defining good movies , completely off shelf, fresh, though its a movie on hit men it will make you feel sympathetic towards all characters in the movie though they have Grey shades.Bruges - The film is extensively shot in Bruges, a medieval city beautifully shot, excellent cinematography. I just fell in love with this place, And now Bruges is on my dream list of places to visit.Dialogues - Quick, quirky, funny and yet speaks a lot about integrity and humanity. Harry's role stands out, 'You got to stick with your principles'Soundtrack - Excellent tracks through out the movie absolutely fitting scores matching the beautiful city, and again On Raglan Road with that particular scene gives me goose bumps. Its a must watch movie. A complete fresh way of looking at things. Though it has a serious story line the way it has been written makes it funny yet emotional, quirky yet soothing, Cruel yet sympathetic. DO NOT MISS THIS...Also like to share this poem On Raglan Road by Patrick Kavanagh Sung by The Dubliners...On Raglan Road on an autumn day I met her first and knew That her dark hair would weave a snare that I might one day rue; I saw the danger, yet I walked along the enchanted way, And I said, let grief be a fallen leaf at the dawning of the day. On Grafton Street in November we tripped lightly along the ledge Of the deep ravine where can be seen the worth of passion's pledge, The Queen of Hearts still making tarts and I not making hay - O I loved too much and by such and such is happiness thrown away. I gave her gifts of the mind I gave her the secret sign that's known To the artists who have known the true gods of sound and stone And word and tint. I did not stint for I gave her poems to say. With her own name there and her own dark hair like clouds over fields of May On a quiet street where old ghosts meet I see her walking now Away from me so hurriedly my reason must allow That I had wooed not as I should a creature made of clay - When the angel woos the clay he'd lose his wings at the dawn of day.Heaven ""In Bruges""",In Bruges

594,canaryotbc,A Modern Monument To 'Shakespearean-like' Storytelling,10,14 September 2011,"In Bruges is a truly wonderful film set in Belgium (... in Bruges), starring Colin Farrell, Ralph Fiennes, and one of the greatest performances from the past 5 years in cinema, from Brendan Gleeson. The plot in brief is two Irish assassins are sent to a hide out after a mission gone awry, with little or no idea of their objectives out in Belgium. After some 'sight-seeing', their boss gets in contact, and the whole dynamic of the film is shaken. As emotions of hate, self-loathing, and prevailing love and compassion become apparent, the film spirals into a grandiose 'Tarantino' esque encounter.The action takes awhile to come in, meaningfully fitted into the narrative, and unlike so many other modern day pictures, never needs to be excused for.There's plenty of gripping, intense, and highly emotional scenes, at it's apex felt in one of the most poignant moments of the past decade in film, involving Brendan Gleeson and a perfectly chosen track from the Dubliners. Whether it's the soundtrack or cast, this film has Celtic blood coursing through it's veins, and no matter how alien the surroundings are, this iconic scene couldn't have been more pertinent with regard to the over-arching theme. I may just have had a tear in my eye.And whether it's midgets in dream-like art house productions in the cobbled streets of Bruges, or fat snooty elephants, or 'Americans', walking up a narrow staircase, the dark humour is great, and will certainly satisfy those in hunger of satire amongst the morbidity bursting at the seams of the piece.For anyone who has seen Sexy Beast, Fiennes is the Ben Kingsley equivalent, the rabid mob boss with a blood-lust, but not without a conscience. This film is too clever to deal in the absolutes, 'Good vs Evil', of traditional Hollywood; the moral compass wavers throughout, and becomes a confrontation based on outlooks over complex subjects like retribution and punishment, grounded where no one is of the divine.The cinematography is breathtaking, and the whole plot feels very Shakespearean, as a modestly sized ensemble of characters are weaved into the film, always with a purpose.And perhaps most of all, i finally 'got' Colin Farrell.",In Bruges

I also was very skeptic about this film. The plot seemed OK. Acting crew looked great but something just didn't add up. But that was all before I actually got the urge to watch this dare I say it ""masterpiece"". This film has that one key element that i seek for in films: it can hold you glued to your seat and keep your eyes pinned on the screen the entire time. This is the kind of film whose scenes have a way of sticking with you and in a way you keep remembering parts of the movie on daily bases. I was very very surprised, in a good way of course, by this movie. Its incredible to see how much can be done without sky-high budget, explosions, and Hollywood-y environment. The plot of the film is as much interesting as one could get and the Oscar nomination really speaks for itself. All in all do yourself a favor and see this great film.

Not since Pulp Fiction, have I seen a movie combine humor, violence, and a cast of tragic characters so well. Look, you can't compare the two to say this was as good or better than Pulp Fiction. It isn't. Period. Pulp Fiction is regarded so highly because it was so unique and interesting for the time. This movie isn't trying to be Pulp Fiction. It doesn't stretch and grasp at the absurd the way a movie like Boondock Saints, which in the grand scheme loses points for trying so hard.This movie is full of laughs, violence that is surprising and makes you uncomfortable about what you just saw, and an ending comparable to a Shakespearean tragedy.Some of it is a little predictable but that predictability is offset by the few times when the film does manage to shock you.

This is your typical British comedy/drama with an embarrassing attempt at being comical. I know all movies shouldn't be a generic American-style action movie, but I've seriously never seen a ""drama/comedy/thriller"" this awful, particularly a British one. Trainspotting was brilliant, Snatch was amazing...etc. I usually don't mind movies picking fun at other nationalities but the way they did it to the Americans was outright ridiculous and even stood out as being irrelevant to the storyline.

We watched the first half with subtitles on, in order to help us understand what exactly was going on. I would honestly recommend watching it was the subtitles for the first half. This movie is a little hard to understand at first because of their accents but aside from that it's just wonderful. The way some of the scenes were filmed you could defiantly tell that they didn't just turn on the camera and say go, every scene and camera placement was perfect.Personally, to me, this film felt so real.

602,kabhay007,Great movie. Nice blend of comedy and thriller,10,14 September 2014,"If you hate Colin Farrell, this will make you think otherwise. Rarely a movie tickles your funny bone and then makes you all gloomy at the same time and that's what differentiates In Bruges from other movies. Great direction, brilliant cinematography and some amazing work from the lead actors make the movie a delight to watch, something you're not gonna regret after you are done with it.The movie uncovers as a slow touristic dedication to the canal-based city of Bruges, unraveling it's medieval architecture, old buildings and sort of sombre milieu and gently turns out into a dark thriller, something you would never expect from it. The chemistry between Farrell and Gleeson gives comic color to the first half from which the movie grows to become even more shadier with the advent of Ralph Fiennes who is funny in his own evil way.Contrary to what a lot of people say, I really liked the ending. It was definitely unexpected and probably a cleaner way to end a dark comedy like this one. I would suggest this to all kinds of audience.

Pretty amazing considering is was Irish/English playwright Martin McDonagh's first feature film. I'm not sure how he got such a great cast for this - having been relatively unknown in American Cinema until this point but Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell have incredible chemistry on camera. This being juxtaposed to the seldom sympathetic Ralph Fiennes.Although always risky to intertwine humor with such a heavy story, McDonagh spun a perfectly cerebral dark comedy revolving around a pair of hit men sent to Bruges after a hit gone badly. Although the film is quirky and subtly hilarious at times the strength of the film lies in the organic dialogue and powerful philosophical/psychological struggle of Colin Farrell's character. As he questions his value, his goodness, and the purpose all the while in Bruges.",In Bruges
606,amos_mcelhone,In Bruges... it's in Belgium. And a magnificent film,10,4 April 2011,"Massive spoilers ahead. If you haven't seen it, STOP READING. Instead, go buy the film right now. Considering the average score and my rating, you know it can't be bad.In Bruges is an amazing film on so many levels. Basically, it's about two Irish hit men, Ray and Ken, working in London. They f#¤k up a job BIG TIME and they are forced to hide out in Bruges by their boss, Harry. So far, nothing groundbreaking. It seems like a standard action comedy flick. But it's only so much more than that. I'd say it's a comedy drama because of all the funny moments and amazingly witty dialog and the subject of the movie, which is dead serious. That's the perfect blend in my opinion - you get humor and seriousness, but those two opposites enhance each other when confronted. The funny bits are even funnier, and the serious bits really get under your skin. What I love most about this film are the characters. And it's interesting that there is no real bad guy. Technically, Harry would be the bad guy, but you can also argue for his point of view. Ray - the main character. He's young, inexperienced and a very direct person. He says what's on his mind, no matter the consequences. He killed a little boy, and he's having a very hard time coping with that, on the verge of suicide. But in the end, he rediscovers the joy of life and decides that he doesn't want to die. We know he didn't mean to kill the boy, and we see his remorse, but still... he is a hit-man, he is a bad man - you can't deny that, but you like him, so you don't want him to die. Ken - Ray's mentor, so to speak. The older, wiser hit-man. He's much more cultivated and easy going and a very mild person in general, which seems odd for his line of work and that only makes him more interesting. He wants to give Ray a second chance because he believes that Ray can change and that he will redeem himself if he quits this line of work and saves the next little boy.Harry - the boss, perhaps the most interesting character of them all. I can't see him as a bad person. He's a fair man who sticks to his principles and actually cares about other people, which is clearly showed near the end where he's asking he pregnant hotel owner to step aside because being a nice person, he doesn't want to put her in harms way. Have you ever seen a hit-man do that before? I think it's amazing. He believes that you can't expect to kill a little boy and get away it. That makes sense. It's a terrible crime which you should be punished for. I really love the ambiguity of the characters and the depth they add to the film. It's hard to decide whose side you're on.Oh I could go on for ages about this. In Bruges is funny, heart breaking, violent, exciting, serious, clever, beautiful, and most important of all - it's deep. It really makes you think. It's rare to see a fun film with so much depth. I mean, has hit men ever been more human? This really is European film at its best!",In Bruges
607,markpeecher,Uber violent look at the duality of humanity's inanity and search for principled living,6,24 July 2018,"This movie raises existential questions about life and meaning when two hit men are ordered to spend time in Bruge, a picturesque, Flemish part of Belgium. Along the way to facing questions such as why pregnant mothers and children deserve special protection that life-stained adults do not, you'll wade through drunken, drug-induced attempts to dampen the meaninglessness of life, together with attempts to connect in romance and pleasure, and even some admirable bravery. I thought the story was just too indulgent in terms of violence that it's legitimacy and storyline was somewhat undermined. Still, it does deliver a wake up call to those who are tempted to float, dreamlike through life without grounding themselves in First Things that genuinely are seeds of true meaningful, fulfilling life.",In Bruges
608,yosiaro,Satire on the Catholic Church,10,8 August 2013,"The hit-man, Ray, in this film was contracted to murder a priest. He even gives regards from his boss, the contractor Harry, as he does the hit. The priest is obviously familiar with Harry. One can only wonder if that priest had molested young Harry, now intent on vengeance. The young boy accidentally shot, alone at night in a church, is too reminiscent of a situation that could lead to such molestation. Did Harry, now an assassination contractor, turn to crime because of the crisis he suffered as a young boy in church? I got the feeling that the screen writer is critical of the Church. The scene in the church in Bruges that owned a vessel containing some of Jesus's blood seemed critical of such beliefs, even satirical. How could a crusader find the blood of Jesus 1000 years after his death? In fairness, the satire is spread in all directions. Hit men have principles too. A hit-man who kills an innocent child must die. Harry thinks he has killed a child in his process of his vendetta. This ""child"" is actually a dwarf. None the less, Harry must be true to his own values and punishes himself.The film laughs at everyone and everything. It is truly entertaining, so it has it's own morality.",In Bruges

613,frank_brouwer_91,'In Bruges' is making me angry and stupid for being not funny,2,30 October 2014,"Before I watched the movie I had great expectations about it. Some people were comparing the style to Guy Richie's movies, or Tarantino's. Well, I'm a fan of both their work. So when I saw the movie I got a little annoyed.Because I always want to give movies a chance to watch, I watched the whole movie. As a result a had a terrible night. I felt very dumb, because I didn't understand it. Was it meant funny? Was it a cultural sort of movie for the intellectual? I didn't get it at all. The whole story-line was so boring to me. There wasn't some tension or reason to feel excited too. I also think directors have their own ways to entertain via film. There are so many sorts of entertainment, but I can't nail this one. It's not just that I want to burn it down, but I don't think it's funny, or entertaining, or a good written story.In the end the the subject got me thinking about a bigger perspective: Is this a cultural thing? Do I have to see the movie twice to get the point? Or am I infected to much with the Hollywood- poison that my expectations couldn't see this coming?At last, I won't say the acting was bad, because I think it wasn't. I think Farrell and Fiennes are great actors. That's not the case. But this movie a comedy? Seriously? This review is full of questions*(? *).

614,chipblue45,I can't recommend this movie enough!,10,7 October 2015,"Irish hit men Ray (Collin Farrel) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) have been ordered to hide out in Bruges by their British boss, Harry (Ralph Fines), soon after Ray botches up his first job and accidentally kills a little boy. Ken, older and more experienced, wants to make the best of the unfortunate circumstance by visiting Bruges' famous museums, churches, and canals while the young novice, Ray, just wants to drink beer to overcome his guilt and forget that he is, in fact, in Bruges. In Bruges is clever, heartfelt, and entertaining, with a surprisingly fresh voice that challenges moral principles, and questions the acceptance of violence in film. Without knowing Mcdonagh's résumé as a playwright, it is apparent that his writing is eloquent and full of energy. The dialogue in this film is fantastic, which helps with the pacing since the main plot points are exposed very early on. Additionally, McDonagh wrote Bruges as one of the main characters in the movie and made the city an active participant in the story rather than a pretty background. Unlike many first time directors, McDonagh is not too eager to flash what he can do with the camera. He beautifully photographs the picturesque old city without resorting to showy camera movements or angles that would have been distracting and even unnecessary. Instead, the camera mimics a tourist's behavior by lingering on ordinary subjects like streets and buildings. As a result, the visual contrast between the tranquil city and the turbulent hit men is striking.Another noteworthy aspect about In Bruges is its unique approach to the gangster/hit man genre. Ray and Ken are not the stereotypical hit men— the stoic, nonchalant Jef Costello in Le Samurai or the mysterious Anton Chigurh from No Country for Old Men— rather, these two are quite ordinary. They face surreal situations like getting into an argument about the cost of an entry (which surprisingly does not result in the ticket-seller being shot in the head), they get nervous about first dates, take contacts out before bed, and get bored by sightseeing. The intentionally anticlimactic scenes, such as chases being halted so the pursuer can look at his map, doing a countdown before a shootout, or even complementing the gun being used to kill one another, exist not only as a visual gag but also to humanize the characters.In Bruges is not simply about guys with guns, but about guys with guns who are conscious about their actions and operate by a set of principles. Harry is a gangster with principles and a man of honor, who will go to the extreme to keep his word. It is hard to believe the gentle, soft-spoken Ken kills people for a living, ""It's what I do"" he says, although he is never seen killing anyone on screen. Ray is suicidal and understandably so, and what is so refreshing about Farrel's character is how he repeatedly admits his crime and expresses his guilt. The outstanding performance by the actors and the nuanced writing by McDonagh underscore the subtle comedy and tragedy that is In Bruges.Martin McDonagh is quickly catching the attention of many, and deservingly so. He does not exploit violence, a major theme in his films and plays, rather, he confronts the audience with the moral dilemma of tolerating it and even being entertained by it. In Bruges has gained critical acclaim and a best screenplay Oscar nomination but is a miss among moviegoers, mainly because not a lot of people are aware of its existence. It is a must see for dark comedy fans and anyone who enjoys an entertaining film with great dialogue and complex characters.",In Bruges

Because it's a train wreck, I kept hoping it would get better, that their would be some type of action... Their isn't. This movie just wanders around like Jazz.Took me two days to complete this Tour de Bruges and I did not get a yellow jersey.Warning: The concentrated slowness contained in the film will cause you your mind to wander to anything and everything, this resulted in me talking in a thick British accent for a full 2 weeks after watching it. I just couldn't stop or shut it off.As a side note: I thick this film belongs in Gitmo Cuba.",In Bruges
617,marvinwyh,The Little Details (contains spoiler!!),9,23 April 2015," The three fat Americans that was laughed by Ray at the beginning of the story, ended it up one of them had heart attack. This was when Harry and Ken try to go upstairs to ""fight"" each other; the doorman told them it's close because some American had heart attacks.  Ray and the girl had dinner at the restaurant, Ray was trying to be rude to make fun of the Canadians, but He didn't know, he thought they were Americans. So that he said something about Vietnamese. He realized it after he got caught on the train departing from Bruges.  The doorman stopped Ken at once. He wants to spend all his coins. It's the coins that let him finish his last plan: throw it to get someone notice it from the tower and so that he could kill himself with no one hurt.  Before Ray could blow Harry's head off from the stairs. He hesitated because he was afraid of murder another baby.  And of course most importantly, at last Harry shot at Ray and blew the ""little boy's"" head off. He couldn't see the head; all he saw is the kid style clothing. And this showed up when Ray came out from the prison, talking to the girl in an out door bar.  At the restaurant, Ray and the girl talked about what they do for living. When Ray asked: do I be looked I shoot people? The Girl answered: no. Only children. Ray was so embarrassed that he grabbed the glass of wine. This, what I think, also let Ray feel more insecure that he decided to suicide the next day. Review:Every story can be told well, but an amazing story needs to have a lot of hints and key points that are leading the story to be more integrated. In Bruges truly is one of my favorite films. The overall ideology has been really well clarified. The Rhythm of the content is very interesting and audience-friendly. I get the sense of humor as well.",In Bruges
618,brainkeen,Fun non-cliché movie,8,27 February 2008,"This movie could have easily have been the mob-hit-man-buddy movie cliché, but it wasn't. This movie is a better movie, technically, than I expected. Collin Farrell's character is reason enough to see it, although the ensemble of actors/characters overall are excellent and worth the price of admission as well. Farrell's character may be viewed as ""un-PC,"" but I think it is important to his character. He comes across ignorant. That ignorance it is also part of the charm of the character...This was one of those movies that I can't help but suggest to others because it was such a good time. The movie also showed a great view of the city of Bruges, which needs to be on my plans when I get to Europe next.",In Bruges

620,lauraq-74711,"Disappointing, specially the ending.",3,25 June 2016,"I sat through the entire film, despite nearly falling asleep during the first half. It was disappointing. The plot starts out nicely. A story about a young man who kills people for money and is drowning in remorse after accidentally killing a little boy. His partner, always by his side, and both of them in the beautiful city of Bruges to hide after his awful act. It could go somewhere, right? It didn't. Positive aspects: I genuinely liked the way it was filmed, it almost had this ""french"" ambiance to it. I don't know how to explain it. It feels like those artsy films with a deep and sad ending. Kind of like 500 days of summer. I was even able to enjoy the humour poorly mixed between the awful way the plot developed. And again, the city is absolutely beautiful and both me and my boyfriend are now obsessed with traveling there.Negative aspects: Right when the ""bad guy"" travels to Bruges, it goes completely nuts. The film just stops being realistic. Seriously, Ken is shot, once in the foot, once in the neck, jumps off a tower, doesn't die, and is still able to tell Ray that the bad guy is coming for him. Also, no one hears any shot, specially that one when Harry is on that small boat and the guy who's piloting the boat doesn't even react to it. And don't get me started on the ending. It was not realistic, it was disappointing, confusing and just... A waste of my time.",In Bruges
621,arhaanchettri,Utterly Disappointing,5,18 April 2017,"I'm not gonna get into too much detail about how the movie panned out for me.... cutting the long story short.....I'm utterly gutted after watching this movie and only wished if I could turn the clock back and did something worthwhile..... initially when I read the plot summary, over the top reviews particularly from the critics (won't say the users 'cause they've no sense of good movies whatsoever, anything that is hyper-praised, high-rated blah blah automatically convinces their mind to be of a quality) I was very much intrigued more than I've been lately before watching anything....right from the start till the first half of the movie, the movie was very slow-paced, bland and uninteresting with mediocre acting plus lame humors and boy Colin Farrell was terrible, every dialogue coming from his mouth with annoying facial expressions had me yawning from time to time...I just can't fathom why he received an award for such an awful performance, instead Brendan Gleeson should've got it... The only good thing I got to witness was the wonderful looking Bruges city... Although the second half of the movie was good to be honest in contrast to the first..but just wasn't good enough to compensate for my already disappointed mood....",In Bruges
622,ahwoods,The closest to screen writing perfection I have ever seen,10,23 November 2016,"In Bruges has been, and I think will stay for a while, the most interesting combination of cinematic gold I've seen in it's genre. The story line, dialogue, acting, scene progression, cinematography it's all great. What captured my interest the most though, and really the ultimate reason why I've been able to rewatch this Film over and over the years is thanks to a uniquely captured interplay found inside the story. A propelling force created by and between the films lovable antihero character creations. I saw something that's hard to describe. It's really something I think you can just feel as your laugh continuously catches you off guard throughout. There's a lot of great humor in honesty and I think the actors captured the essence intended by the writing. They nailed it. It almost feels like improvisation. It reaches an organic level bordering on legendary.They've captured something here. The unexpected candidacy resulted in comedy that caught me off guard in all the right ways. The assassin with a conscience, an empathetic chord striking and interest attracting element that will hook you in and keep you coming back for more. The writing I found here is the benchmark renting, then leasing, now owning space in the back of my mind. There I think it will remain as a constant personal aspiration of my own. Ever even coming close to writing like this as an end result, much less post production, would be something I could really consider a true accomplishment. A great dark comedy great if not the greatest. One of my favorite movies of all time based upon shear creativity. Do I think it's under rated. Not if your from an audience that watches Housewives of Atlanta or Honey Boo Boo. Not if you you are addicted to the opposite of laughter..and enjoyment. Not if you're a toddler, probably. That's fair. Not if you are a potato. It's awesome. In Bruges! In Bruges! In Bruges!! Crushed it.",In Bruges
623,jbpeyri,Overlooked masterpiece.,10,7 July 2019,"FIrst review. Spoiler free.Hard to beleive it´s been 11 years since I first saw it. A friend of mine showed it to me even though I could barely speak english at the time (learning english in Ireland is helpful though) but even though I couldn't understand some of the dialogue I instantly fell in love with this movie.
The main cast (Fiennes,Gleeson, Farell) is just incredible and they deliver some of the best performance of their respective carreers. Dialogues are sharp and hilarious though never feel forced or out of place, every details count.
Writing is good, it´s definitly not a story you´ve heard before and the way the characters evolve and react is rarely seen in movies.
Direction is masterfull. Photography is great, the shots (mostly at night) of the city really set the mood from the very first scene as is the music.
Probably one of the very best movie in the very tricky genre of Dark comedy as some dialogues can be truly hilarious even though the set up is dark, almost desperate at time.
A must see although it might not be for everyone.
Best movie from McDonnagh so far in my opinion, yes even better than Three Bilboards.. even though I loved it. They actually have a lot in common.
McDonnagh might be one of the best director of his generation and I hope to see more in the future.",In Bruges
624,noaman11,Simply GREAT,10,14 February 2008,"I just watched the premier of this movie at a special screening and I must admit that I loved it!!! One of the best movies I have seen in a long time Storyline was very interesting along with some very strong performances. Colin Farrell proved that he can act if given a chance and in my opinion he should get an Oscar nomination for his role, his comedy was at its best. Ralph Fienes was great in a supporting role and he should also get a nomination for his performance. The ending is very unpredictable as I was not expecting what is going to happen....I recommend this movie to everybody, so go watch it and enjoy this great movie...",In Bruges
625,jlynch85,Symetrical Yet Unbalanced (but in a good way),9,23 February 2008,"Ray, Ray, Ray! We can't help but be captured by his goofiness. His petulance! His pique. He is like a bad puppy. He is what happens when potential and opportunity do NOT cross paths. We are given no real background on any of the characters, only this slice of their lives,but sophistication isn't required here. We see the essence of wastrelism in Ray. The inevitable Greek tragedy of Ken, Ken who should (and does!) know better. In Harry we see the kind of principled villainy that is wierdly common i.e. the bank robber who would never steal a car or say, the rapist who would never stiff a waitress for a tip. Ken and Ray, a fine pair of Irishmen, work for a good fellow named Harry. Ken is the greater tragedy of this comi-tragic and even occasionally sublime duo. This movie speaks of basic humanity in some pretty base humans. There are lines even drunken little people should not cross. Even medieval tower docents can go too far. Elephants do not belong in towers and pompous Canadians do get their beaks bent occasionally. Hookers it turns out may be found in brothels. How bizarre but strangely real this film is. Unfortunately, as seems to be the case in reality, the innocent victims are incidental because the guilty ones are so much more interesting. The real question asked by great film is ""who are we?"" This Movie asks us again from a fresh perspective.Colin Farrell finally cast well! Fine acting throughout. 9.5 out of ten for pacing. A modern masterwork; Near poetic. Let's see what our new film maker does next. His own will be a hard act to follow.",In Bruges

627,samkitudani,Imagine Shakespeare wrote something dark but also absolutely hilarious.,10,15 September 2020,"Feels funny that I saw this movie for the first time back in 2009. And I have seen it SO many times since. A lot of people still haven't watched this yet. It's Martin's first film as director, maybe he is now more famous after Three Billboards which he deserves to be. This movie is driven by its three male characters mainly with two hitmen and their boss. Ray and Ken being complete opposites adds to their chemistry too.Without going into details, I'd say if you want to laugh more and be in shock and awe of the beauty of this little story based in Bruges then please watch it. (Side note: Not a spoiler but The scene with the song On Raglan Road playing is perfection.)",In Bruges
628,gaspunk2,the irony! oh gosh the irony was what made it!,9,29 June 2008,"So I watched In Bruges last night. From the very opening of the film, Colin Farrell's voice over informs us he's a hit-man. Now, this bit of information didn't turn me off the story, but a part of me wondered just how much more this film could offer to the many hit-man parodies.Well, after viewing the entire film, I'm not sure if In Bruges added anything expediential new to the hit-man genre, but I'll be damned if it wasn't smart, funny, incredibly witty with its irony, and just all around great! In Bruges's goal isn't to add a brand new take on hit-man movies (at parts it plays on some of the same strategies as Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), but it still has its very original voice and execution. I think what made this film stand out so much for me was it's brilliance in irony! The screenwriter, Martin McDonagh (and director) knew exactly what he wanted to do, and more important, knew what the audience thought he was going to dotherefore, twisting the story into many unpredictable moments. And further, he was able to build up these amazingly funny and oddly morally-compelling situations for his characters. Like when watching the Ocean 11/12/13 movies, where you know the cast is pretty much just having one big party while filming; In Bruges's story makes it seem like McDonagh had his own little writing-partydeciding never to restrict himself when challenging his characters' morals (and always doing so in very amusing fashions) and constantly trying to make us guess ""where to next?"" I would love to go deeper into many ironic scenes, but I'm afraid that would make the film less rewarding for those who haven't seen it (and if you have seen it, I'm sure you already know what I'm talking about).Aside from all the compliments I want to keep giving this film, I do have one beef. It's one of those beefs that you let slide because the movie as a whole is just so well done, however, I feel I should bring it up brieflyperhaps somebody can clear it up for me. The only issue I had had to do with Brendan Gleeson's character, Ken. It's never really explained just why Ken gets so attached to Ray (Colin Farrell). We know the governing reason of why he feels sorry for him (and we know why Ray hates himself); however, within the actions of the film we find out that while Ray is very new to the hit-man occupation, Ken has been in the business for awhile now. Because this is the case, I feel like Ken would have had to encounter moral dilemmas like the main one in this film before. Yet, he reacts very differently during this moral-dilemma, but I never understood why this time was so different. What was it that he saw in Ray that was so moving? Surely, he's seen reactions like Ray's before within this kind of profession.Nevertheless, my small complaint is nothing to dwell on, strictly because everything else is so well executed and fun. Each actor gives a pitch-perfect performance; owning their moments when needing to and bowing down to their partners when needing too. (And Fiennes scene when smashing the phone had me on the floorsorry, I just really wanted to give that scene a shot out)",In Bruges

630,mattsans,Dumbest Movie Ever Created,1,28 October 2018,"I have never givena 1, but if I could I'd rate it negative stars. There was NO STORY LINE. It was a chain of events that had no meaning. Considering this movie had 2 cast members from Harry Potter, I thought it would've been good. Horrible acting, stupid plot. This was a waste of money.

631,ffpech,Brilliant first movie of McDonagh,9,30 November 2013,"Written and directed by McDonagh, it is his first feature movie; his ""Irish drama writer"" background shows throughout each scene, witty dialogues, black-humor, slightly melancholic yet full of action. I can't recall any movie that is this much literary, while also being a Tarantino-like ""homage to B action movies"".It's about two hit men, but they hardly seem to be inclined to any killing, and actually they hardly kill anyone during the entire movie. They are quite nice persons, with empathy, remorse, even some romantic sentiments - yes, the whole story is quite absurd, but endlessly entertaining. The actual plot hardly matters, every scene is worthy by itself, if only for the unsurpassable acting (C. Farrell, R. Fiennes, etc.). Not incidentally, the cinematography is also close to perfection.I gave it ""only"" 9/10 because there are some little clichés here and there, but it is a slight disappointment only in comparison to this otherwise very unique movie.If you have seen and enjoyed this movie, see also McDonagh's earlier short movie, ""Six Shooter"" (2005) (strange but fun), and definitely see his second feature movie, ""Seven Psychopaths"" (2012), which is quite similar to ""In Bruges"" in nature.",In Bruges
