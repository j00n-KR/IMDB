0,bkoganbing,Some Daring Getaways,8,31 May 2013,"Other than the Donald Strachey series of movies starring Chad Allen, I've never seen the Capital District of New York State used as a film location before. The Place Beyond The Pines is the story of two men whose fateful meeting one day set in motion a series of events that would ultimately involve their teen sons.Shot on location in Albany, Schenectady, and several surrounding small towns, this film casts Ryan Gosling as a daredevil carnival motorcycle stunt rider who gives Eva Mendes a bundle of joy in their encounter.But Gosling is a responsible sort, sort of. He wants to do the right thing for Mendes so he takes up bank robbery where his skill as a rider has him execute some daring getaways. She's got money now to support their kid, but Gosling dares the odds once too often and in a fateful encounter with rookie Schenectady cop Bradley Cooper, he's killed in a shootout.After that the focus is on Cooper who's ambitious sort, his father is Harris Yulin a Supreme Court judge. He builds from this incident which makes him a decorated hero in a gambit from LA Confidential, he turns on several of his fellow officers who were corrupt in any event and breaks the blue wall of silence.And in fifteen years as Cooper is embarking on a run for statewide office both his son Emory Cohen and Gosling's son Dane DeHaan go to the same school and it leads to some interesting results.My only problem with The Place Beyond The Pines is that Gosling's character is so charismatic that the film slackens off, once he's killed off halfway through the movie. Still it's a great story with some riveting performances by players of several generations.",The Place Beyond the Pines
1,Leofwine_draca,A surprisingly deep and mature thriller,8,12 January 2015,"I had no idea what to expect from this, but I'd seen and liked Ryan Gosling in DRIVE so I thought I'd give it a go. And the director has clearly been taking a few pointers from that film, because stylistically it's very similar: slow paced, scenes shot the same way, the same type of music. Hell, even Gosling is playing a similar character, a guy who best communicates through violent action.The first hour of this film is fantastic: gripping, edge-of-the-seat stuff, with another excellent performance from the star. Then things go in a different direction for the second hour, with the less-interesting Bradley Cooper becoming the focus of the story. This part's still pretty good, if more familiar. It all rounds out again with a third act which ups the suspense to a satisfying climax.THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES is an actor's film, and indeed there are some great performances here: Gosling, an almost unrecognisable Eva Mendes, Ben Mendelsohn, and Dane DeHaan all give very good performances, and it's a treat to see Harris Yulin (SCARFACE) on the screen again. But the technical values and the mature script easily match the calibre of the acting, making this an all-round winner. It's not perfect - some sections are too slow, and some characters just don't hold the interest like others - but fans of DRIVE should like it nonetheless.",The Place Beyond the Pines
2,SnoopyStyle,Slow start but gets interesting with Bradley Cooper,7,12 March 2014,"Motorcycle stunt rider Luke (Ryan Gosling) quits his carnival job riding the cage. He wants to start a new life with waitress former girlfriend Romina (Eva Mendes) and their son. He starts robbing banks. He tries bring a crib to his kid, but he ends up hitting Romina's boyfriend Kofi. He's on a head on collision with police officer Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper).It starts slow and doesn't get interesting until around midway. At 140 minutes, it is a very long movie. It's a very slow build into something more poetic. Director Derek Cianfrance tries to create a Greek tragedy. I wish he would trust that the actors could get across the required emotions without a prolong take. I don't need an action thriller, but this movie could be more efficient. The Bradley Cooper part is infinitely more compelling. The slow pacing in that part of the story works much better. Then it jumps 15 years into the future. The slow pacing strikes again. The two teens are well played, but it feels like a third movie. By then, I want this whole thing to explode and wrap up.",The Place Beyond the Pines
3,Horst_In_Translation,Of fathers and sons,6,6 February 2017,"""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is an American movie in the English language by writer and director Derek Cianfrance. Last year, he made headlines with ""The Light between Oceans"", but this one we have here may still be his most known work. After ""Blue Valentine"", he reunites again with actor Ryan Gosling. You can structure this film we have here very well. The first third belongs to Gosling, the second to Cooper and the third and final chapter to Emory Cohen and Dane DeHaan. Supporting performances come from Rose Byrne, Ray Liotta and 2017 Oscar front-runner Mahershala Ali. I watched this really long movie (2 hours 20 minutes) back then when it came out for the first time and I remember that I really loved Goslings's part, thought Cooper's was merely okay and disliked the final chapter. On rewatch, it all moves a bit closer together I guess. The first chapter is probably still my favorite, but the second comes close and the last wasn't as bad as I remembered either. I am generally not a great fan of Gosling and Cooper, but I think both did a fine job here and show that they are capable of carrying films as lead actors if the script suits them.The first shot of Gosling (filmed from behind) is as memorable as the last (on the ground) that actually introduces Cooper's story line. And it's a really fluent transition overall. Even the transition between chapters 2 and 3 is still fairly solid, even if there is a massive jump in time that lasts for over a decade. Yes the coincidence level in the last part may be a bit too much, but in the face of how tense the entire situation is, it is not too difficult to look beyond that I guess. And I also really liked the ending. After all the aggression and hate and violence, Jason finally focuses more nicely on the memory of his dad as he attempts to honor his heritage in getting his very first own bike as well. It adds a certain harmony and also lets the audience leave the theater with a smile on their lips that still feels authentic, which was quite a challenge looking at everything that went wrong in the characters' lives before that. I think the acting overall is fairly good in this movie. Cianfrance sure has a way to get the best out of his cast and like I said I am not the greatest fan of some some of the actors in here and my appreciation makes it even more impressive.Still I must say that for a film of almost 2.5 hours, the greatness is not enough. Here and there, there is a really good moment and I remember being really shocked because of Gosling's early death, but in retrospective, it really makes sense. Oh yeah, and Ray Liotta should definitely play villains more often. He has a great aura surrounding him that seems pretty evil and his was definitely my favorite supporting performance that elevated the second chapter a lot. So overall, I would say that this one is on par quality-wise with Cianfrance's movie from last year. A well-rounded effort that feels realistic and authentic despite really a lot happening from start to finish. The characters here sure go through a lot and it's perfectly fine that nobody in here is really likable (maybe Gosling's character still the most because he does not seem violent and just cares for his son's well-being) because it still makes sure all the time it is an interesting watch and I was curious about what would happen to the characters. Also good on rewatch. See it.",The Place Beyond the Pines
4,Prismark10,Fathers and sons,7,16 October 2018,"The Place Beyond the Pines starts out with motorcycle stunt rider Luke (Ryan Gosling) who starts robbing banks in order to provide for his baby. A son he belatedly discovers he has because he broke up with his girlfriend Romina, (Eva Mendes) who is now living with another man. Luke's plans to be a good father does not end well as his luck runs out. Avery (Bradley Cooper) is a novice cop who goes after Luke and later gets in some bother with corrupt cops in his department. The ambitious Avery uses this to get into the District Attorney's office.The third act of the movie is set 15 years later as the children of these two men cross paths. Both children are delinquents in some ways.The film goes for an epic scope with interweaving stories. There is a great opening with Gosling as he goes out to ride the wall of death.The film loses its focus when it concentrates on their kids because the story is not that great. However director Derek Cianfrance has made an intriguing film. It is a shame that he runs out of his narrative drive by the end.",The Place Beyond the Pines
5,claudio_carvalho,Entwined Lives Haunted by the Past,8,21 June 2013,"In Schenectady, the motorcycle stunt rider Lucas ""Luke"" Glanton (Ryan Gosling) drives in the globe of death of a traveling carnival. On the day of his last presentation before an one-year excursion, he is visited by a woman named Romina Gutierrez (Eva Mendes), who had a love affair with him. He finds that he has a baby with her, but Romina lives with another man, Kofi (Mahershala Ali). Luke quits his job and decides to stay in the town. He befriends the owner of a small garage, Robin (Ben Mendelsohn), who offers a job and a place to stay. However, Luke does not make enough money to support his son and he decides to heist banks. One day, things go wrong and Luke is murdered by the rookie police officer Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper). Avery is considered a hero by the press and soon he discovers corruption among his colleagues. The ambitious Avery plots a scheme seeking promotion and he gets evidence to put the police officers in prison. Fifteen years later, Avery is the Attorney General in Troy and he is estranged of his son AJ (Emory Cohen). Avery is in political campaign and sends AJ, who is a troublemaker, to Schenectady. Avery befriends his schoolmate Jason Kancam (Dane DeHaan), who is Luke's son. Soon their lives are entwined and haunted by the past. ""The Place beyond the Pines"" is a great drama and police story, actually three entwined stories in one movie. In the first one, Ryan Gosling's performance recalls his introspective character in ""Drive"", but this time in a motorcycle. Then Bradley Cooper performs an ambitious character very different from those in romantic comedies. The last part is the weakest, trying to show the effect of the families with absent father on the babies the same way it had happened with Luke, but the performance of Emory Cohen is weak and Jason actually had an apparently caring stepfather that is a good man, on the contrary of his biological father. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Lugar Onde Tudo Termina"" (""The Place Where Everything Ends"")",The Place Beyond the Pines
6,nogodnomasters,"I TOLD YOU THAT STORY, SO I COULD TELL YOU THIS ONE",6,9 August 2018,"Luke (Ryan Gosling) is a bad boy motorcycle rider who travels with a circus and has one night stands. Eva Mendes was one of those conquests. A year or so later they meet again. She has his child and a boyfriend (Mahershala Ali). Luke doesn't want to be an absentee father and forces his way into their life through gifts which he pays for with his newly acquired bank robbing addiction.About 50 minutes into the film, we are introduced another main character, policeman Avery (Bradley Cooper). Then act three start about 40 minutes later (16years or so) with all the children grown and only Eva Mendes among the adults looking any older.The ending is supposed to be heart warming, but doesn't make it. The film is long, but it is not deep. The action moves like a man running with one shoe nailed in place. I never felt for any of the characters. The scene with Bradley Cooper crying was just horrible. That was grade B acting topping off a stiff performance. Gosling on the other hand gave us a strong performance and Mendes was never developed. What was her problem? She wants him, she doesn't want him, she wants him, she doesn't want him.It wants to cycle back, but then sputters, it doesn't take off. It might make do for a Redbox rental.Parental Guide: F-bomb, after sex scene, no nudity.",The Place Beyond the Pines
7,kosmasp,Going in cycles,8,12 April 2014,"Eva Mendes is not only beautiful, but also a great actress. Something that also can be said about Mr. Cooper and Mr. Gosling. While Blue Valentine (same director) did concentrate on a single relationship (and two people), this is a wider look on relationships and consequences of some actions people take.Just because someone is doing a bad thing, does not make them a bad person. Same goes for a person with a badge (police). The movie will not give you easy answer and might take away a few things early on, that might be surprising (if no one has told you that is). But the emotional impact should be a really strong one. If you can bare to sit through it, it will be worth your while",The Place Beyond the Pines
8,lee_eisenberg,shifting focus,8,25 August 2013,"What really caught my eye about ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is how the focus shifts as the movie progresses. First it's about Luke, then it's about Avery, lastly it's about the sons. Moreover, in each case you want the focused-on character to achieve his goal even if it's something ethically questionable. It's as though director Derek Cianfrance - who previously directed Ryan Gosling in ""Blue Valentine"" - is playing with the audience, much like Alfred Hitchcock did with ""Psycho"" (which also shifted its focus from character to character, getting the audience to root for each character). The result is a very good, tense movie, one that progresses at just the right pace to let more and more of the story develop. I recommend it.",The Place Beyond the Pines
9,jboothmillard,The Place Beyond the Pines,7,30 August 2013,"I saw a trailer and a few clips from this film while it was in cinemas, and it was recommended rather well on Film 2012 with Claudia Winkleman and Danny Leigh, and other sources, so I was certainly going to watch it, and for the good cast involved. Basically the film is made up of three parts, all related to each other, the title by the way is the English meaning of the city of Schenectady, New York, which is derived loosely from a Mohawk word for ""place beyond the pine plains."" The first part is about stunt motorcycle rider Luke Glanton (Ryan Gosling) who is told by former lover Romina (Eva Mendes) he has a son, so he tries to get work to support the child, even though she is with Kofi (Mahershala Ali) and doesn't want him to be part of the child's life. With auto repair shop owner Robin (Ben Mendelsohn) he starts robbing banks, for a while successful, but after a short stint in jail he pushes his luck and tries without Robin, only to get chased by Officer Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper), cornered he tells Romina not to tell his son about what he is, and he gets shot by Cross out of the window and is dead on the ground. The second part is about Avery, who becomes a hero for shooting the criminal, but he feels great guilt for killing him, especially knowing he had a son, as he does, and he finds fellow officers Scott (Gabe Fazio) and Deluca (Ray Liotta) have seized the stolen money and are getting him involved in the corruption. Cross tries to hand the money back to Romina, but she refuses to take it because of him killing the father of her child, and his commanding officer refuses to have it turned in and have accusations about officers made within the department, but he captures footage of an officer trying to get cocaine, and proving the crimes manages to become assistant district attorney. The third and final part is set fifteen years later, Cross is trying to cope with his teenage son AJ (Emory Cohen) while also running for office, he has also separated from wife Jennifer (Rose Byrne), and at his new high school the son has befriended Jason (Dane DeHaan), Romina's son, and who does not know anything about his father. AJ and Jason are arrested for possession of drugs, but recognising Jason's name Cross manages to drop the charges, while AJ is told to stay away from his friend Jason wants to know about his biological father, and with Romina refusing to tell him anything he gets the answers from stepfather Robin. He is later invited by AJ to his house party, and he recognises a photograph of Cross and knows he killed his father, he has a fight with AJ and is hospitalised, but returning to the house he badly beats up AJ and takes Cross hostage, they drive into the woods where the teenager considered killing his father's killer, but he changes his mind with the man tearfully apologising. In the end Jason takes his wallet and drives his car away, in the wallet is a photograph of him as a baby with mother Romina and father Luke which Cross had taken, Cross wins the vote and becomes New York Attorney General, Romina gets an envelope saying ""Mom"" with the photograph inside, and Jason buys a motorcycle to run away and live a life as a traveller like his father. Also starring Harris Yulin as Al Cross, Bruce Greenwood as Bill Killcullen and Robert Clohessy as Chief Weirzbowski. Goslin is great at being the criminal trying to do good for his family, Cooper is good being the lawman who makes mistakes but tries to correct them however he can, and DeHaan is terrific as the young man wanting to learn about and perhaps avenge his father, and supporting cast members like Mendes are suitable as well. All three of the stories are filled with surprising and compelling melodramatic material, there are some very intriguing twists, I agree coincidence plays a big part, but that is not too distracting when you consider how smart and well crafted it all is, a most watchable crime drama. Very good!",The Place Beyond the Pines
10,moonspinner55,"Lengthy and overly-involved journey, but one which is certainly well-acted...",5,15 April 2013,"Lofty title for what is an often overwrought odyssey that begins with the shooting of a bank robber by a rookie police officer in New York. The actions by the cop--who is not only the son of a prominent judge with a rich kid's education, but one with political aspirations to boot!--leads to a shakedown of the corrupt police department, while the lives of the two men are brought together by tragedy and fate. Heavy-going and yet thoughtful, intriguing drama in three acts from director Derek Cianfrance, who co-wrote the screenplay with Ben Coccio and Darius Marder. The film is sprawled out like a novel, and runs the risk of becoming a melodramatic potboiler, though it features superlative performances from leads Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper (who just barely share one sequence together). Cianfrance takes several sharp turns in his narrative (he seems to relish the unpredictable), but this leads to some disappointment in his follow-through. The 'ironic' underlining of the plot comes off as contrived, which is made even less convincing by the fact nobody visually changes in the course of the picture's 15-year time span. One is apt to give the movie the benefit of the doubt for the first 90 minutes or so (based on the forceful acting alone), yet the final chapter with the offspring of the main characters tends to wander beyond the pines and into the mire. ** from ****",The Place Beyond the Pines
11,blanche-2,Two films in one,8,22 May 2016,"While not without its problems, ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" (a phrase that refers to Schnectady, NY) is a powerful film with some excellent performances.It starts out as one story and ends up being another. The main story seems to be about two men, Luke (Ryan Gosling), a motorcyclist who learns he has a son and wants to provide for him; and Avery, an ambitious police officer who learns he's surrounded by corrupt cops. The worlds of the two men collide.The film seems to be going in one direction, but suddenly, it's fifteen years later and we're confronted with the sons of these two men -- A.J. (Emory Cohen) and Dane DeHaan (Jason), and the impact of the past on the present.This is a story about how two different men cope with watershed moments in their lives; it's about luck, ambition, families, fathers, and young men seeking their fathers' love and attention.It's hard to write anything more or it gives the story away. At 2 hours and 20 minutes, it's a bit too long.The acting is remarkable, particularly from Ryan Gosling as Luke. He is magnificent as a man with no focus other than his motorcycle, whose life changes when he realizes his ex-girlfriend had his baby. He then becomes determined to provide for them; unfortunately he doesn't make the best choices. Ben Mendelsohn is terrific as Robin, who obviously believes in preserving the best of Luke for his son. Bradley Cooper's role is much less showy than Gosling's, but he makes the most of it. As Luke's ex, Eva Mendes plays a tough, determined woman, as determined to stay away from Luke as Luke is to reconcile. The unsung hero in this is her partner Kofi (Mahershala Ali), a man who loves Jason as his own.Derek Cianfrance has done a beautiful job of directing this complicated film, giving us characters we can care about and a strong plot. The first part is stronger, in part due to Gosling, but I did like the quieter second part as well. Highly recommended.",The Place Beyond the Pines
12,michaelRokeefe,Sins of the fathers.,9,9 April 2014,"Derek Cianfrance directs and shares duty writing and taking part in the screenplay. He previously gave us BLUE VALENTINE. This movie evolves around the parental dysfunction of two men. Luke(Ryan Gosling)is a pro motorcycle rider in the daring globe of death feature of a carnival. He fathers a son, Jason(Dane DeHaan),with his girlfriend(Eva Mendes)in Schenectady, New York. The family element is dysfunctional at best. Luke quits the traveling carnival to put his bike riding skills to use in robbing banks; thus an attempt to take care of his son. He will cross paths with a rookie cop, Avery Cross(Bradley Cooper), who wants to please his father, a former politico, by moving up the ranks in the Schenectady police force by exposing corruption in the department. Moving ahead fifteen years; Cross, in the middle of a major political campaign, is forced by his ex-wife to take custody of their son A.J.(Emory Cohen), who is a stoner on the edge of being out of control. By circumstance the two sons will meet at high school and take on the burden of dealing with the legacy and sins of their fathers. And as through out the movie, the only refuge of solace is found in a place beyond the pines. This film leaves very little room for sympathy. Also in the cast: Ben Mendelsohn, Mahershala Ali, Bruce Greenwood, Ray Liotta and Craig Van Hook.",The Place Beyond the Pines
13,hitchcockthelegend,"If you ride like lightning, you're going to crash like thunder.",8,2 January 2019,"The Place Beyond the Pines is directed by Derek Cianfrance and Cianfrance co-writes the screenplay with Ben Coccio and Darius Marder. It stars Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, Eva Mendes, Emory Cohen, Dane Dehaan, Ray Liotta, Ben Mendelsohn and Rose Byrne. Music is by Mike Patton and cinematography by Sean Bobbitt.A motorcycle stunt rider finds he has a son he never knew about and turns to robbing banks as a way to provide for both the child and his one time lover. This puts him on collision course with an ambitious rookie cop that has serious life changing consequences for both of them...The Place Beyond the Pines (superb title) is a three parter of a character study that examines the critical decisions we make in life whilst putting different characters along a road of reckoning. The atmosphere of palpable human foibles is quickly established by Cianfrance, the introduction of stunt rider Luke Ganton (Gosling mesmerising) the kick start for what will be a multiple character piece even though the narrative core is purely about Ganton and cop Avery (Cooper) and their impact on each other and those connected to each.Such is a key element of events in the story, it's difficult to say too much because this picture demands that spoilers are not dished out willy nilly. Going in blind without knowledge of the story trajectory is a must to garner maximum rewards. What can be said is that for the final third the pic does lose momentum, there's a big shift of emphasis (though critically connected to all that has gone on previously). It's not a film killer, though, for this remains a damn fine film, one that is packed with utterly gripping sequences, but the ambitiousness shown by Cianfrance is almost the undoing of a fascinatingly engrossing experience.The consequences of choices are profoundly explored here, the multigenerational axis riveting in execution by director and writers alike. It also looks terrific, evocative cinematography from Bobbitt (12 Years a Slave) is in turn boosted by Patton's tonally compliant musical score. Ultimately, to enjoy fully you will have to accept implausible contrivances and that the psychological digging never really achieves all that it should. A bit of better thought for the last third and some trimming of the run time would have helped greatly, but this is still quality film making and recommended to grown up film fans for sure. 8/10",The Place Beyond the Pines
14,LeonLouisRicci,Much Ado and Too Much,5,28 September 2013,"Laden with its Long Length and Overdone with Stories this thing plays out like a pot of steaming water that never seems to boil. It builds and builds in its many Set-Pieces and then its off to Set-Up something else. Some have said that this is some sort of Great New Way of Filmmaking that is Rich and Rewarding Drama. There is so much sprawl that it never attains Profound Implications from Interactions. That seems to be the point of all this and it tries oh so hard it becomes Weary, Tedious, and Ultimately Unfulfilling. Each of its Three-Parts are Related, Literally. The Father and the Son and the Father and the Son, all Karmically Connected in some sort of Realism that contains a lack of a Metaphysical Sense that might have made more Sense.There are parts here that intrigue but there is just too much of it and nothing much that seems Riveting or Revealing. For all its movement through Time, it just sort of lies there asking the Viewer to Contemplate the Ironies and it makes much of Human Frailties that lead to Consequences Beyond Control.

15,grantss,Good crime-drama,7,13 May 2014,"Good crime-drama. More than a crime-drama, in fact, an epic human drama.Epic in that it spans 16-17 years and covers two generations of two families. Very ambitious in this regard and it mostly pulls it off. The flow of the story from the character you always assumed would be the main character, to another character, to their kids is quite seamless and provides the spine for which should be a moving and profound drama.However, it falls short of greatness. In painting with such broad strokes, the writers and director gloss over details, especially emotional content and character development. Some slowing down in places would have been very useful, simply to engage the audience. Instead we are expected to be swept along with the speed of the movie and the grandness of its arc, without caring too much about the characters and their motivations. It just feels a bit hollow in the end. I would not have minded at all if the movie was 20-30 minutes longer, in order to develop more of the characters, especially those of the kids.This said, it is a very interesting story and certainly worth watching.",The Place Beyond the Pines

17,neil-476,Tedious and interminable tale of unpleasant folk,7,3 May 2013,"A carnival stunt biker discovers he has a baby son he never knew about and leaves the carnival, embarking on bank robberies to provide for the child. One of these robberies results in an encounter with a police officer who is dubbed a hero as a result, although the immediate results on his career are problematic. Fifteen years later, the sons of these two men encounter each other.This film comprises 3 separate stories: although they join into a single story, each is also capable of standing alone. Ryan Gosling is the stunt cyclist, Bradley Cooper is the cop, and Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen are their respective sons. At the time of writing, this movie has 116 IMDb reviews - it has been out a while in the States - and a score of 7.8 out of 10. I'm jiggered if I know why.Let me start with Ryan Gosling. I have seen his 6 most recent films, and I simply don't get why he is so highly thought of: he has given the same emotionless performance in every one of those films. I get nothing from him at all. Conversely, with each new film I see him in, Bradley Cooper gives me more and, in this film, his is the standout performance: a decent man, feeling he isn't the hero he has been labelled, stuck with principles which make what follows the ""hero"" incident problematic for him, Walsh's performance made me feel some of the character's turmoil and, for me, was by far the best thing about this film, although DeHaan, Eva Mendes and Harris Yulin were also good.But there was a lot I didn't care for. The film is 140 minutes and could have been told satisfactorily in 90. The movie sets up things which are never really pursued. In particular, Eva Mendes' character, one of the more sympathetic characters, is subjected to a number of things which should have resolutions but which never do. Also, the effort put into setting up the ""rogue cop"" subplot leads one to expect it to have a bigger payoff than it does. Emory Cohen's character, hampered much of the time with an incomprehensible accent (think DeToro in Usual Suspects and turn it up to 11) is simply horrible in every way, although I suspect it is written and directed like that rather than being Cohen's fault. And, apart from the poetic final sequence featuring DeHaan, the story a) is unedifying and b) doesn't really hang together.I came out of this after nearly two and a half hours, thinking, ""So what?""",The Place Beyond the Pines
18,evanston_dad,"Good Grief, What a Slog",3,4 December 2013,"""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is easily one of the most morose films I've ever seen.It feels like the screenwriter came up with a dramatic climax first, and then proceeded, in fits and starts, to write some drafts of what a screenplay leading up to that climax might feel like. Unfortunately, he didn't pick just one, and the result is a meandering film that constantly feels like it's starting over. The end product is way too long, and is not helped by the fact that the tone is one of nearly relentless and one-note gloom.Some good actors like Bradley Cooper and Ryan Gosling are lost in this desultory mess, and I stopped caring about what would happen to their characters and anyone else for that matter long before the movie itself ended.Grade: D",The Place Beyond the Pines
19,ferguson-6,Father-Son issues abound,7,8 March 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. With an extended tracking shot to open the film, we follow Ryan Gosling, a motorcycle stunt rider, from his trailer through the carnival grounds and right into the metal sphere with his co-riders. It's an exhilarating start to the film and introduces Luke (Gosling) as a heavily tatted star attraction on the carnival circuit.This is director Derek Cianfrance's follow-up to his 2010 critically acclaimed Blue Valentine. While that film painfully presented the misery of a bad marriage, this latest shows multi-generational fallout from poor decisions and even worse father-son relationships. Cianfrance has quite an eye for well-intentioned, but inadequate personality types. This latest is presented in triptych format ... three distinct story divisions. The first segment is mesmerizing and follows Luke's attempt to ""do right"" by his newly discovered infant son - the result of last year's carnival trip to this same town and a tryst with Romina, a local gal played by Eva Mendes.Gosling is especially effective (yet again) as he falls in with local mechanic played by a terrific Ben Mendelsohn (frightening in Animal Kingdom). The two hatch a scheme to capitalize on Luke's bike riding skills by robbing banks. These ""jobs"" allow us to see the other side of Luke, who seems sincere in his desire to provide for the child and win back Romina. Things go badly when Luke crosses paths with rookie street cop Avery Cross (played by Bradley Cooper). Watching Gosling's contradictory personalities is quite amazing ... he flips from quietly charming to cold-blooded brutal bank robber in the blink of an eye.The story then shifts to follow Avery and his strained relations with his wife (Rose Byrne), their infant son, and Avery's former state Supreme Court judge father (Harris Yulin). A sub-plot brings in police department corruption led by ... who else? ... Ray Liotta. Mr. Liotta still possesses the ability to scare the crap out of his fellow actors and anyone watching the movie. This corruption and the idealistic and ambitious nature of Avery aren't a very pleasant mixture, but it sets the stage for the final act.Flashing forward 15 years, brings us to a fairly predictable situation that still proves interesting. The previous stories focused on the failed relationships of Luke and his father, Luke and his mis-fired attempt at being a dad, and the awkwardness of Avery and his father. Now we see the resulting mess that are the two now teenage boys. The sons are played by Emory Cohen and Dane DeHaan (who was memorable as Cricket in Lawless). DeHaan especially shines as the Gosling/Mendes prodigy.Sean Bobbitt is the film's Director of Photography and he deserves special mention for his work with Cianfrance in bringing a different and intimate look to the characters, setting and story. Also, Mike Patton's unusual score fits perfectly and keeps the viewer on track. This is a very uncomfortable movie to watch, but those who enjoy tough, artsy films will be rewarded. www.MovieReviewsFromTheDark.wordpress.com",The Place Beyond the Pines
20,anaconda-40658,Place Beyond Conventions.,9,24 September 2015,"The Place Beyond the Pines (2012): Dir: Derek Cianfrance / Cast: Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, Eva Mendes, Ray Liotta, Rose Byrne: Deep psychological drama about refuge with regards to two fathers. We have Ryan Gosling as a motorcycle stunt driver who discovers that his ex-girlfriend has been raising his infant son. He attempts to reconnect but she is living with someone else. He ends up in court for assault then he hooks up with an auto mechanic who teaches him the basics for robbing banks. This works with Gosling committing the robberies and his partner stationed with a truck for which Gosling can escape. The second act involves a cop, played by Bradley Cooper who is regarded as a hero after a pursuit ends fatally in an urban home. This leads to dealing with corrupt cops urging him to accept stolen money and stealing evidence. The third act is somewhat contrived fifteen years later when the sons of two of the characters meet in school and get busted for drugs. This is enhanced when one of the boys learns of the fate of his father and how his friend's father was responsible for his death. This is an intriguing and compelling film that plays like three movies in one with director Derek Cianfrance allowing his actors to shine such as Gosling as someone with a desire to connect but recklessly fails, and Cooper pulled in two directions within his conscience. Eva Mendes plays a mother torn by a past relationship. Ray Liotta plays a corrupt cop relying on Cooper to play devil's advocate. Rose Byrnes is cast as Cooper's wife. In the end the message is fathers failing their duties and honors. Score: 9 / 10",The Place Beyond the Pines
21,phd_travel,Surprsingly engrossing saga,8,14 October 2013,The is a multi generational saga. It's surprisingly engrossing - even though it's not an action movie it's quite tense. Not what you'd expect some surprising things happen. The story is well written and doesn't have clichés. There are no clear heroes and villains. Everyone is flawed and human exhibiting nobility and bad choices.Ryan Gosling is convincing as a motor cycle stunt rider turned bank robber. For a leading man he isn't afraid of looking ugly which is why he can take on so many different roles. Bradley is good too as a cop/lawyer. Eva Mendes acts as well in drama as comedy. The grief and pain are so clearly etched on her face it's quite memorable.Worth a watch.,The Place Beyond the Pines
22,Wuchakk,The sins of the father come home to roost in the Capital region of New York State,7,8 January 2018,"RELEASED IN 2012 and directed by Joe Derek Cianfrance, ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" chronicles events in 1997 in Schenectady, NY, when a bank-robber's confrontation with a rookie police officer (Ryan Gosling & Bradley Cooper) has ramifications on their progeny (Dane DeHaan & Emory Cohen). Eva Mendes and Rose Byrne play the women in their lives while Mahershala Ali and Ray Liotta are on hand as a stepdad and corrupt cop respectively.The intriguing title stems from the Mohawk word 'Schenectady' for ""beyond the pine plains"" (the city where the events take place). The scheme Luke (Gosling) and Robin (Ben Mendelsohn) utilize to hold up banks was the method Carl Gugasian, the ""Friday Night Robber,"" applied for over three decades.This is a Grade A crime drama/thriller and I found all three acts absorbing, although the first act is arguably the most compelling. Gosling has that Brando-like swagger and charisma, as do DeHaan and Cohen to a lesser degree. Liotta stands out as the shady cop. Unfortunately, the movie's hindered by nonsensical plot elements, like the unjustified guilt of one character (no matter how you slice it, the guy deserved what he got) and the pic in the wallet so many years later. If you can look beyond these dubious components this is a nigh great crime drama. THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 20 minutes and was shot in Schenectady, New York, and surrounding region (Glenville, Latham, Niskayuna & Altamont).

23,gradyharp,"'If you ride like lightning, you're going to crash like thunder.'",10,9 August 2013,"Derek Cianfrance and Ben Coccio have devised a story that is so engrossing the almost 2 ½ hour cinematic version seems short. They created a screenplay with Darius Marder that embraces so many current questions of deciding what is right and wrong and turned the script over to the talented Derek Cianfrance to direct. It is actually three stories in different time frames so that we can study the effects of fathers on sons and how the seeds of the past bloom into bizarre hothouse blooms, rank with malodorous overtones but holding stamens of considered convictions.The film opens in a tacky carnival in Schenectady, NY (the Native American word for 'the place beyond the pines') where we meet a mysterious, tattooed and mythical motorcycle racer, Luke, (Ryan Gosling) drives out of a traveling carnival globe of death and whizzes through the backstreets of Schenectady desperately trying to connect with a former lover, Romina, (Eva Mendes) who recently and secretly gave birth to the stunt rider's son Kevin aka Jason but is now living with Kofi (Mahershala Ali). In an attempt to provide for his 'new family', Luke quits the carnival life and with the inspiration from a casual mechanic friend Robin (Ben Mendelsohn) commits a series of bank robberies aided by his superior riding ability. The stakes rise as Luke is put on a collision course with an ambitious police officer, Avery Cross, (Bradley Cooper) looking to quickly move up the ranks in a police department riddled with corruption as headed by Deluca (Ray Liotta). Cross is married (Rose Byrne) and has a son, neither of whom stands a chance for affection in Avery's big plan for his future. The sweeping drama unfolds over fifteen years as the sins of the past haunt the present days lives of two high school boys - Jason (Dane DeHaan) and AJ (Emory Cohen) - wrestling with the legacy they've inherited. The only refuge is found in the place beyond the pines.The cast is uniformly excellent, able to make unlikable characters into three-dimensional people about whom we learn to care and understand.

24,zetes,"Stumbles a bit in its third act, but overall it's excellent",9,23 June 2013,"Derek Cianfrance follows up his auspicious feature film debut, Blue Valentine, with an even better film, putting him amongst the best directors working today. I'll say right up front that his scripts - both of them - are far from perfect, but his direction is wonderful. The Place Beyond the Pines actually does have a fantastic and original screenplay, but it falters in its third section. The film plays out in three distinct parts. The first part concerns a carnival performer, Ryan Gosling, who impregnates a fan, Eva Mendes. He wants to be there for his son, but he's kind of a loser. Mendes just wants him to go away, but Gosling attempts to provide for her and the kid by robbing banks. The second section involves Bradley Cooper, a police officer who gets caught up in a nightmare of police corruption. This section also co-stars Rose Byrne as Cooper's wife and Ray Liotta as Cooper's superior, who is trying to pull him into the world of being a bad cop. The third section is about two teenage boys, Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen, who become friends but then are forbidden from it by their parents. When they look into why, they discover awful secrets about their past. The story of this third section is fine, but Cohen and DeHaan are both pretty awful. Cohen in particular is painful to listen to - it feels like they wanted to cast a member of The Jersey Shore 2.0 or something. Sure, there are kids who act just like this, but it's hard to keep the audience's sympathies when they want to punch your protagonist. DeHaan is an actor I've liked before, particular in Chronicle. He feels like he's just reprising his performance from that film - he played a teenage supervillain there, and it's just too big a performance for this more subtle film. The film still stands as one of the best of the year.",The Place Beyond the Pines

Regrettably The Place Beyond the Pines could be one of those books which transfers to film poorly. The story-line is long and dry. Dry in the way of an over cooked turkey, which is hard to digest. The acting and characters are wooden. The characters are stiff and unbelievable. Great cast {ie Cooper) but the directer gives a feel that every character is constipated while they are talking. The Place Beyond the Pines story unfolds like a boring power point presentation which has too much information. The movie lost my attention after the first 30 minutes.

26,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Place Beyond The Pines,7,13 April 2013,"Written and directed by Derek Cianfrance, The Place Beyond the Pines is that ambitious dramatic epic that tried, but failed to reach its lofty peaks. It had moments mostly brought out by superb casting, but bogged down by an average father and sons tale that didn't have much emotional punch, sagging toward the end when it failed to pull out all its stops. Which is a pity, given the talent at the filmmaker's disposal, only to get caught up in its moralistic and karmic focus.The star of the show from the get go Is non other than Ryan Gosling, who plays Handsome Luke, a stunt motorcycle rider whose troupe travelling career brought him back to Schenectady, New York, where old flame Romina (a very anorexic looking Eva Mendes) to come visit, and learn that he's now the father of their relatively new born son. Suddenly the weight of the world comes crashing down onto his carefree days, and pangs of guilt and fatherhood responsibilities begin to fester, leading him to stay in town, and turning to crime as the quick way to provide for his family. A combination of his motorcycle skills, plenty of guts and an accomplice prove to be fruitful, until the second act that comes rolling around that turned his fortune another way.The narrative then shifts to the heroic cop Avery (Bradley Cooper looking really old fashioned), whose exploits have brought him fame, and ill gotten fortune no thanks to corrupt forces in his chosen profession. Here is where the drama gives way to heavier examination of is themes, and looks at moral corruption straight in the eye. We get introduced to Avery, and become witnesses to the crime that took place, and the crime of who actually shot first, coupled with the incentive to cover one's tracks. The narrative here is the richest of the lot as it combines Bradley Cooper's acting chops, with the strength of the material at hand, where his Avery twists circumstances around to maximize personal benefit and opportunity. What started out as good intentions, actually had a different spin and motivation to it altogether.And the final part of the three act structure fast forwards the story some 15 years into the future, where Avery is now running for political office, but is distracted on the side by his wayward son AJ (Emory Cohen), a good for nothing youth who, in what would be an encounter of karmic proportions, befriends Luke's son Jason (Dane DeHaan). This then turned into a classic father and son story, where the sins of the fathers, and that theme of guilt, befalls the next generation, and how they get to deal with it. It's the usual teenage stories of slacker- hood, friendship, fights, drugs, parties and so on, in direct contrast to the more adult moments the first two acts presented.The Place Beyond the Pines becomes that intense character study piece that stayed engaging as long as the leading characters remained up on screen, but failed in its final act where the more lightweight, young actors took over the mantle that didn't seem to know which direction it wanted to go, mirroring their characters' aimlessness, and waste of time. Ryan Gosling did the best he could with limited screen time, and Bradley Cooper ably carried the film through to the finale. Eva Mendes was also grossly underutilized, disappearing for the most parts for more than half the film, making this quite the testosterone driven movie.Some nifty cinematography and camera work – there were plenty of continuous shots in one take to make you sit up and take note of – and a wonderful score by Mike Patton propped the film up when the narrative failed to pick up speed in the final act, and the critical moment that will leave you pondering about is the turn in the film regarding who shot first. If only that was left a mystery, then perhaps it will provide more moral ambiguity, and forcing you to choose sides rather than to show-hand, and allow you to condemn from the get go.",The Place Beyond the Pines
27,namashi_1,A Devastating Human-Story!,9,31 July 2013,"Derek Cianfrance's 'The Place Beyond the Pines' is one of the finest films I've watched in 2013. Its a devastating human-story, that unfolds with conviction & ambition. Leave any other film aside & watch 'The Place Beyond the Pines'. 'The Place Beyond the Pines' Synopsis: A motorcycle stunt rider turns to robbing banks as a way to provide for his lover and their newborn child, a decision that puts him on a collision course with an ambitious rookie cop navigating a department ruled by a corrupt detective.'The Place Beyond the Pines' is about Humans. Its about the decisions they take & the consequences they face later on. The story of a motorcycle stunt rider is about zeroing on-to the wrong. The story of the ambitious rookie cop is about responsibility & guilt. The final story based upon 2 kids, who realize they have much more in common than just themselves, is about the loss of innocence. Each story is narrated so brutally & bluntly, it left me disturbed yet mesmerized. Derek Cianfrance, Ben Coccio & Darius Marder's Screenplay is unbelievably sad, but also poetic. It depicts the lives of diverse individuals without inhibitions, which is its biggest advantage. Derek Cianfrance's Direction is haunting. Cinematography is top-class. Editing is razor-sharp. Performance-Wise: Bradley Cooper delivers an astoundingly arresting performance. He plays the ambitious yet guilt-driven cop with impeccable understanding. This performance merits an Oscar-Nod! Ryan Gosling, with limited screen-time, does well, as always. Eva Mendes is excellent. This is her finest performance to date. Dane DeHaan & Emory Cohen are wonderful in their respective parts. Ray Liotta is efficient. Bruce Greenwood is good. On the whole, 'The Place Beyond the Pines' is a remarkably well-made film, that will you stunned.",The Place Beyond the Pines
28,StevePulaski,"A somber, generational drama",9,20 April 2013,"The Place Beyond the Pines features an opening shot I won't soon forget. The camera intimately follows a tattooed man through a seamy carnival, as he puts his clothes on and makes his way through a large crowd of people to get to his motorcycle. He and three other people will ride separate motorcycles in a large, metal sphere, dodging each other by seconds and defying gravity all the more. All of this is done in one lengthy two-minute take that sets the eerily natural and ambitious tone of the film we're about to see.The tattooed man is Ryan Gosling's Luke, who quits this carnival job when he discovers he has a child with Romina (Eva Mendes), an ex-lover. He tries to be an appropriate father-figure, despite her moving on and carrying on a relationship with a new man. Nonetheless, Luke tries to man up and take care of responsibilities by quitting his carnival job in favor of a bank-robbing career with a close friend to service him and his child financially.The film is a generational triptych, focusing on three different stories over the span of years. During the first act, Luke becomes acquainted with officer Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper), who's life after a heroic event will be the direct focus of the second act. Meanwhile, Luke's son and Avery's son meeting in a sort of ill-fated relationship will be the prominent focus of the third act, effectively making the triptych complete.Gosling has gone on to be one of the most reliable characters actors in such a short amount of time. Bradley Cooper as well, and both men take a comfortable shift into the front row with this picture. Gosling has a way of being subtle and electric on screen, due to this careful approach to weighty material like this. Cooper, however, plays almost every role he encounters with a common-man realism, making it easy for many audience members to relate to. Supporting performances involving Eva Mendes and Ray Liotta (who is sadly shortchanged here, though) are also quite memorable and give the film the added zest it needs.However, the truly compelling theme that encompasses each vignette is the idea of fatherhood and its role it plays in the lives of youths. Luke is a promising man, despite clearly having made many a mistake in his time. His intentions are great, but his delivery is almost too-little-too-late as he realizes that his girlfriend really doesn't want or need his help anymore. She has moved on and now it's his turn. Avery, on the other hand, is a father who is there for his young son, but also a bit too consumed by work and his new heroic status. Regardless, he still spends more time with his kid than Luke, but in the end, they prove to be equally mediocre teenagers.Director Derek Cianfrance seems to be showing that fatherhood works in mysterious ways, and that intentions and attention doesn't always make a good kid. This theme seems to encompass much of the film, even during the final shot when we see Luke's son take on a life we thought he found contemptible. This is a film that, in one-hundred and forty minutes, takes on a wide range of human emotion and makes you feel it too.The Place Beyond the Pines is a wonderfully ambitious film, in a different league than other heavy works such as Cloud Atlas and The Tree of Life. Rather than be existential and coming with an extremely weighty moral and ambiguity, it sets its ambitiousness on being arty, subtle, and relatively moving, making the most unlikable character likable as we see his true emotions and humanity come forth. This is one of my favorite films of the year.NOTE: My video review of The Place Beyond the Pines, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGhIsozRvcIStarring: Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, Eva Mendes, and Ray Liotta.

30,MovieAddict2016,"Once Upon a Time, Beyond the Pines",9,11 May 2013,"Wow, what a movie. I saw this once and knew I liked it, considering it to be incredibly ambitious; I also thought it was also incredibly flawed. But it has haunted me, like all great films do, and I find myself coming back to it time and time again.Derek Cianfrance's last film, ""Blue Valentine,"" had a similar effect, and was probably one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen - to the extent that, when I recommend it to people, I often tell them I loved it, but would never want to see it again. This film is similarly emotionally draining, but I feel like the message behind it, or the core, is at least somewhat more redemptive than Valentine was: it all sort of boils down to the relationships between fathers and sons, and the sins passed down, and all that.The movie can be frustrating at times, and it certainly drags. That's also part of its charm. The director is heavily influenced by Sergio Leone -- this is Italian filmmaking in America in 2013 -- and he didn't choose Mike Patton to do the soundtrack by coincidence. Patton has been a champion of Ennio Morricone for years, writing previous film soundtracks based on the Italian composer's music, and he even uses a Morricone theme in this film. It immediately reminded me of ""Once Upon a Time in America."" This is brilliant, resonant filmmaking. It is flawed, sure; most great films are in their own way. It's also going to stay with you long after the credits end. I think it may be one of the best dramas I've seen in years.",The Place Beyond the Pines
31,lasttimeisaw,The Place Beyond the Pines,7,12 April 2013,"A recent cinema-going of American indie hopeful Derek Cianfrance's follow-up of his breakthrough BLUE VALENTINE (2010, 7/10), reunited with Ryan Gosling and recruited hot blood Bradley Cooper and Eva Mendes, but don't be fooled by the misguiding trailer, it is not a cat- catching-mouse robbery thriller, this 140 minutes saga strenuously narrates a karma-inducing retribution epic, although it has its ponderous clumsiness during its execution, and an inclination of descending gusto may stall one's concentration along the way, the film (not the least) did a decent job in treating its material fairly, and arduously carves out a thorough realization of a modern-day tragedy (through a triad narrative). The film begins with a shot of Ryan Gosling's bulky naked upper-body before his motorcycle stunt performance, tracking under shadowy light with wobbly camera movement, markedly implying a Nicolas Winding Refn's DRIVE (2011, 8/10) analog, continues with a robbery crime under the way to ensure his future with his beloved girl (and his infant son), it's like a redo of the said Gosling-Refn variegated palette experiment, so there must be some twist awaits, and the leverage here was whether or not it would pay off, luckily in my opinion, it worked.When Bradley Cooper appears first time after 50 minutes more or less, the film portentously is channeled to start a new page with Cooper's salt-of-the-earth leading man bonhomie, a standard ""hero"" in the plot, it also augurs the slackening of the tautness and volatility, occasionally a wisp of stolidness wafts around until the third act with a blunt 15-years-later transition, Dane DeHann (the on-the-horizon new Harry Osborn in the upcoming sequel of the rebooted SPIDER-MAN franchise) and Emory Cohen (from the TV leftover SMASH) assume the next-generation clash, but since the film lingers too long, as a matter of course, a benumbing fatigue hinder's one's attention to the their puerile strife, only when the tit-for-tat showdown arrives (predated with many plot-facilitating coincidences), there is a spasm of tension hanging in a moment with a satisfactory consequence the tacky mercifulness prevails again.About the shaky-cam camera-work, now becomes stale even in the mainstream filmmaking, but Cianfrance and DP Sean Bobbitt are not wavering in difficult shots, for the opening motors- crisscross-in-the-steel-globe gambit and especially with the frenetic robbery sequences, which by the way is amateurishly perfunctory (maybe on purpose to evade copycats), the thrill is tangible while the whole tale is far-fetched. A hindsight, the ignition of the story is triggered by a response ad lib by Mendes' mother, so it seems that the ability to keep secret is generally considered as a foible predisposed upon female sex, a funny discovery!",The Place Beyond the Pines
32,KineticSeoul,Very watchable crime drama but isn't a great one,7,18 May 2013,"I thought this was a good crime drama just not a great one. It had my attention most of the way through but isn't something I would sit through again. Well at least about the first hour is a crime drama and the best part of this movie. And the rest is how the characters deal and cope with what happened in the first hour. The thing is, this is quite a predictable movie most of the way through. And maybe just one thing that I didn't really expect. Well it was something I was expecting but just didn't happen. The plot show 3 different story-lines that connect and come to full circle. The first story is about Luke(Ryan Gosling) a expert motorcycle stunt guy that really knows how to ride his motorcycle. Gosling played a pro stunt driver in the movie ""Drive"" and now he plays a pro motorcycle stunt guy that goes around robbing banks. The trailer made it sort of seem like it's a movie about a bank robber and a cop going head to head but that isn't what this movie is about. Thus it goes to the second part of the story which is about a Cop named Avery Cross(Bradley Cooper). Who has to deal with the whole ordeal with the motorcycle bank robber and the corruption in the police force. I thought the people he put behind bars would come back at him but that doesn't happen, which is the expected but didn't happen aspect of this flick. Bradley Cooper's character in this sort of reminded me of his character in the movie ""The Words"". Which is another character that is caught between saving his own ass or doing the right thing and he basically ends up in a similar situation. And the third part of the story is about the sons of the motorcycle bank robber and the cop, although it may seem a bit too coincidental. This is a compelling and even a bit of a haunting drama but nothing all that much of a shocker and just didn't bring about much emotions. It's a crime drama worth seeing but just isn't a great one.7.5/10",The Place Beyond the Pines
33,Hellmant,"One of the great crime dramas, in the same league as something like 'GOODFELLAS'!",10,24 April 2013,"'THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES': Five Stars (Out of Five)Director Derek Cianfrance's third feature film reteams him with actor Ryan Gosling (who also appeared in his sophomore film; 2010's 'BLUE VALENTINE'). Bradley Cooper and Dane DeHaan (of 'CHRONICLE' fame) also star in the film which also features supporting turns from Eva Mendes, Emory Cohen, Ben Mendelsohn, Rose Byrne, Bruce Greenwood and Ray Liotta. 'BLUE VALENTINE' is an exceptional film that chronicles the marriage of a young couple where as this film focuses on the relationships between two men (a cop and a criminal) and their sons. It's played out in three different segments, shifting between it's three different lead character's points of view. Once again Cianfrance shows what an impressive filmmaker he is and Gosling and Cooper once again turn in stellar performances as well. This is one of the great crime dramas, in the same league as something like 'GOODFELLAS' (and in my opinion even better).The film first focuses on Luke (Gosling), a motorcycle racer working for a traveling carnival show who finds out he has a son with an old flame he met (Mendes) while traveling through Schenectady (the Mohawk word for 'beyond the pine plains'), New York. He quits his carnival gig so he can stay in town and keep in contact with his ex-lover and baby. He goes to work for an auto shop owner (Mendelsohn) and also takes up bank robbing in order to provide money for his new family. The film also focuses on Avery Cross (Cooper), a cop looking to get ahead who pursues Luke, and Luke's son Jason (DeHaan), when he's a troubled teenager wanting to learn about his father's past. The screenplay was co-written by Cianfrance along with Ben Coccio and Darius Marder. Cianfrance came up with the idea for the film with Gosling when he asked him what he wanted to do in life that he hadn't already done. Gosling responded that he always wanted to rob a bank and said he fantasized about doing it on a motorcycle because of it's speed and agility and the fact that the helmet would conceal his identity. He also said he would hide the bike in the back of a truck to make the rest of his getaway because the police would be looking for a motorcycle. This of course became the movie's pivotal action plot line and Gosling was the only actor Cianfrance felt could play the role. Cianfrance also wrote the other lead role (of police officer Avery Cross) for Bradley Cooper and swears he wouldn't have made the film without him in the role. He drove 5 hours to Toronto in order to convince Cooper to do the part. Of course Gosling and Cooper's performances became the driving force behind the film but it's also highlighted by beautiful cinematography (by Sean Bobbitt) and an excellent score by Mike Patton. The film actually has all the elements that make a great movie; the story alone is very unique and original in it's structure. It's Cianfrance's beautiful directing though that really makes the film a true masterpiece. With this and 'BLUE VALENTINE' he really proves himself to be a directing force to be reckoned with and I think this film will go down in cinematic history as one of the truly great crime dramas.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEK4_Cj6reg",The Place Beyond the Pines
34,thesar-2,Beyond the Pine of the Apes,5,14 July 2013,"I think I wanted to like The Place Beyond the Pines more. Following the days after my viewing, I did view it more favorably, but, ultimately, stuck with my initial dead-end rating of the film. (5/10 stars.)Of several concerns I had with the movie, the main one was the length. The movie went on and on and on and I get the need to tell an original and in-depth story, but there was so much that could've been cut here to make it tighter and more engaging. Not to mention – and this is just my own point of view, I was thoroughly invested in the first story (of three intertwining fables) with Ryan Gosling and when that abruptly ended 50 or so minutes in, I was disappointed.I'm getting ahead of myself here. The movie's three chapters involve a nowhere-headed circus act who finds out he's a father and then becomes a criminal to somewhat support said child, a ""decent"" policeman who's trying to get promoted and finally, two kids who are byproducts of the first two chapters.Really, in 140 minutes, I just summed up the entire experience there.Okay, now I can move on. Where was I? Oh, yeah, I got emotionally involved in the sad sack in story one and when that chapter ended, I was – also – sad. So, with no choice, if I wanted to finish this movie, I had to re-engage with story #2, even though it was less interesting. True, it was a bridge, like most part twos of trilogies, but at that time, I didn't know there would be a third section.I am being completely biased here and, perhaps a bit horny – ha – but the son of one of these men, ""AJ"" (Emory Cohen) was so cute, at least I had something after two hours to keep me interested.Normally, I wouldn't review a movie or mention someone I find attractive, but damn, after what seemed like four hours, I needed something to keep me awake. It was painfully obvious where this film was headed so the incredibly slow and deliberate pacing made finishing this a chore. Giving me an ""AJ"" was at least a gift to finish the film.Overall, stepping back, this movie was, in fact, original and was interesting enough to watch with fairly good performances and cinematography, but it's pacing and length would never necessitate a second viewing. So, I would recommend only one viewing and then move Beyond the Pines.",The Place Beyond the Pines
35,Robert_duder,A captivating drama about life and the ripple effect,7,4 August 2013,"I went into the film with really no expectations. I hadn't seen a trailer and only heard a little about it. It was an achingly long film, probably much longer than it needed to be but that isn't unusual for an art-house film such as this. It certainly has a good production value and a great cast and some good performances. For being two and a half hours long it didn't necessarily feel like it was too long though it did start to drag towards the end. The movie is the type of film where one event ripples out to effect each character over time. I will give the film kudos for having a very distinct feel to it. The first hour or more feels like a thriller/heist movie and then the last part of the movie is far more of a drama. To be able to properly combine these two elements and still make it entertaining is not an easy feet and this film does it. It certainly did not blow me away and I honestly expected more from the characters especially Gosling and Cooper who had two characters with a lot of potential but I wasn't blown away by either one. I felt like I had seen this type of character from Gosling before and I felt like Cooper didn't do the most with his side of things.Ryan Gosling is an excellent actor and has had some really great roles. I think he seems to enjoy playing the brooding anti-hero and this film certainly fits that bill. He's misunderstood, and a loner and a bit of a nomad and trying to do what is right in all the wrong ways. I kept expecting something really big to happen with his character and while it does not disappoint it wasn't quite the development I expected and it does nothing for his acting ability. Bradley Cooper shows up nearly half way through the film. I think his character has perhaps the most potential for really demonstrating a dark side of being a hero and a serious breach of morality but Cooper sort of floats through and doesn't really give it his all. I would have liked to have seen more scenes with Cooper and Gosling and maybe they could have really brought out some powerful performances in each other. Eva Mendes does a good job as Gosling's on again/off again woman and mother of his child. She has a small role but its a good one and well done. Ray Liotta shows up yet again playing a crooked cop/sleazy mobster type. This guy is probably type casted more than any person in Hollywood. He is literally the same character every time. The role obviously fits the film but to have Liotta play it...again...is way beyond stereotypical. Emory Cohen and Dane DeHaan play the young adult children of Cooper and Gosling respectively. Both do a good job but much like the rest of the cast they never really blow you away.I always maintain that nine times out of ten a writer should not direct his own material. Derek Cianfrance is director and co-writer and I think he has a very strong story that is gritty and dark and fascinating at times but it takes you right to the edge of being great and powerful and then just stops. It doesn't exceed expectations and just barely meets them. All that being said, it is a good drama and easily watchable. It has plenty of shock value to different characters and how they unravel and seeing everything play out over the course of 15 years is captivating. Its a good movie without being a great movie but you can see where it could have been great. Gosling and Cooper fans will enjoy it and if you're looking for an indie art-house film with a much higher production value than some of them then you will certainly enjoy this!! Absolutely worth watching at least once. 7/10",The Place Beyond the Pines
36,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Ambitious, original drama/thriller, that loses credibility toward the end",7,19 August 2013,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningLuke (Ryan Gosling) is an audacious motorcycle stunt rider, who falls in to hard times after a fling with Romina (Eva Mendes), who gives birth to his son. Cut out from his life, but determined to provide for him, he takes to using his riding talents to carry out armed bank robberies, with the assistance of a friend. This, of course, won't end well, and comes to a head when Luke finds himself holed up in a house with ambitious rookie cop Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper.) After exposing widespread corruption in his force, fifteen years later Cross is becoming District Attorney, but his world threatens to shatter down all around him when his son makes an unfortunate new friend.Despite having a lengthy, sprawling yarn of a tale to tell, it becomes clear early on in The Place Beyond the Pines that the emphasis is more on lingering style and a haunting atmosphere, as the drained, haunting soundtrack makes all too clear. For the first half an hour, it almost gets by on this, despite forming the early stages of a long tale that runs out over the course of two hours and two generations. Gradually, though, the story itself gains momentum, weaving an absorbing and heavily stylistic feel, before making a huge narrative leap where the story becomes contrived and loses plausibility. It may be essential to the plot, but the two sons introduction and unknown history is no less unlikely.Fundamentally, though, this is no less of a well made, ambitious and dynamic film, driven by strong central performances from two of Hollywood's top boys at the moment, in the shape of Cooper and Gosling, with strong, solid support from Mendes, Bruce Greenwood and, in practically a cameo role, Ray Liotta as the big Kahuna corrupt cop, although the sub plot he commands also, to nit pick, feels rushed and crammed in to a movie in it's own right. Derek Cianfrance has little big name, mainstream work to his name, and The Place Beyond the Pines shows his work has a distinctive, if sadly flawed, style to it. ***",The Place Beyond the Pines
37,paul2001sw-1,"A promising start, but the final impact is ordinary",7,24 August 2015,"'The Places Beyond the Pines' tells us the story of the death of a criminal, and its longer term aftermath: three separate stories focus sequentially on a different character. The weakest section is the third, focusing on the children of the original participants: their motivations seem more stylised, and less particular, than those of the leads in the earlier sections, which by contrast are subtly and well portrayed. This is a self-consciously serious movie, but it's not quite as engaging as it could be: none of the protagonists are particularly appealing. It's not just that they're flawed human beings; they're all quite close personalities, selfishly self-contained, and while their alienation provides a unifying theme the film fails to truly probe its underlying causes. What is left is simply a story of some not particularly likable people doing bad things to each other. I've seen plenty worse movies, but ultimately this one takes quite a lot of screen time and, while it takes it quite well, the overall effect is underwhelming rather than emotional.",The Place Beyond the Pines
38,MOscarbradley,An extraordinary movie that pulls the rug from under you,10,19 February 2013,"You might call Derek Cianfrance's tremendous new movie ""A Place Beyond the Pines"" a blue-collar epic or a tragedy in three acts; it's certainly a drama in three acts. It runs for two hours and twenty minutes and it covers a period of about 17 years and there are really only about four major characters. To talk at all about the films storyline would be to spoil what is really an extraordinary narrative where even the coincidences of the third act seem to me to have resonance of great drama and it is magnificently played by its four principal actors.Ryan Gosling, continuing to cement his reputation as the finest young actor of his generation, is Luke, an outlaw anti-hero worthy to stand beside any played by Dean or Newman. Bradley Cooper, so much more now that the light comedian of The Hangover movies, is Avery, the idealistic young rookie cop who finds the consequences of a single act of violence leads him down paths he previously may only have dreamed of and relative newcomers Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen are sons in desperate need of a father's love and guidance.This is bold and innovative film-making from Cianfrance with a strong emphasis on plot development. It plays out like a great page-turner of a novel but is in fact an original screenplay. After ""Blue Valentine"" this marks Cianfrance out as a major big league player.",The Place Beyond the Pines
39,bowmanblue,Not everyone's cup of tea,7,23 October 2014,"I've read some reviews of 'The Place Beyond the Pines' where people have either loved it, or wanted to turn it off after ten minutes. I have to say that I kind of agree with both sides. I wanted to turn it off after ten minutes, but decided to stick with it and I'm glad I did.It's no big secret that the film is - loosely - split into three acts, each focusing on one person out of an overall story which covers all three. How much you like it will depend on which character you find the most interesting. Personally, I found Bradley Cooper's story the most engaging, therefore I enjoyed the film because of the middle segment, but everyone will have their own favourite.Oddly enough, most people like Ryan Gosling's character/segment the best, but I found it a bit of a chore. I definitely think there's a good movie here, but most people will probably prefer one or two of the segments more interesting than the remaining one.It's not a short film, so be prepared for a bit of a sit-in to fully appreciate it. Plus there are a few bits that slow the pace down a little. However, I felt - when the tension finally builds - that it's a pretty impressive (and even bold?) piece of film-making which deserve to be enjoyed (but possibly not by everyone).",The Place Beyond the Pines
40,dromasca,an underrated cinematographic gem,9,11 September 2018,"Where does director Derek Cianfrance hide? It may be my fault for not remembering having seen any his movies before or even knowing his name. It is certainly the fault of the distributors of 'The Place Beyond the Pines' which was made in 2013 for not making out of this film a blockbuster or at least a festivals circuit success. Produced in 2012 it has Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, and Eva Mendes in the cast, all of them acting superbly, it's a beautifully written story about crime and corruption, guilt and fatherhood, which is at the same time human and universal as well as rooted to the detail in the realities of a small town in the state of New York where much of the filming was done on location. So did this film only enjoy a limited launching, and why did he make only a small profit over the rather modest sum of money it cost? These questions may be asked in an investigation of the mysteries of the American movies distribution system.It is not easy to tell what this film is about without committing the 'spoiler sin', but I will try to avoid the trap. It starts as the story of a life and of a love lost in mistakes, with little chances to end well. It continues as the story of a cop trying to do the right things and fighting the corrupt system he works in. It ends as a story of paternal responsibility and how the next generation is due to follow the steps of fathers and whether breaking the circle of fate and social conditioning is possible. So there are three stories here, three stories with different focus and pace, partly sharing the same characters and with a continuity determined by the leading ideas. As I try to tell all these, I realize how many important details remain out, how well they are interleaved and what value they add, how well the whole narrative structure stands. It's a strong and moving story (or better said collection of stories) told in an original manner.I need to add a few special mentions about acting. For Ryan Gosling this may be the first big 'bad guy' role of his career but he cannot really be a 'bad guy' to the end, as he adds complexity and deepness to his character. Same can be said about the character played by Bradley Cooper but working on the opposite direction, as we see the hero cop never at peace with the decisions he needs to take even when it seems to be 'the right thing' (fighting crime and police corruption). Eva Mendes and Ray Liotta provide more substance to their supporting roles which could have easily fallen in standard melodrama. We come to know the place where the action happens and the way it changes in time, and in part of the secret 'The Place Beyond the Pines' looks to good and authentic is the careful description and familiarity of the authors for the details.How can this wonderful film be taken out of the shade of forget it undeservedly lies? The best would be if the very talented film director who is Derek Cianfrance will make some more successful movies. I hope that this will happen, and then 'The Place Beyond the Pines' will have its second chance.",The Place Beyond the Pines
41,g-bodyl,Cianfrance Is a Director To Keep An Eye On!,9,16 July 2014,"If Derek Cianfrance is going to make bold films such as ""The Place Beyond the Pines,"" he is definitely worth keeping an eye on. He has such a keen eye for detail and story, as evidenced in this daring crime saga that somehow reminds me of, ""The Godfather."" I like how this film is told in three different sections, each one of them unique but interconnected with each other. At a lengthy 140 minutes, this is an ambitious film that highly succeeds thanks to excellent acting, a wonderful screenplay, and expert directing.Cianfrance's film tells us the story about a motorcycle stunt man named Luke who decides to rob banks in order to provide for his family and a rookie cop named Avery who is ambitious and clearly dislikes dirty cops and he has a dream to rise to the top. We see how these two men's world collides with each other and how consequences ensue because of this collision.The acting is phenomenal. Ryan Gosling yet again succeeds in playing an anti-hero that we still root for and he shows he is one of the greatest actors in our generation. Bradley Cooper has really come a long way in his career and with this film, is now on a hot streak. Eva Mendes shines brightly in her best role yet. Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen are excellent newcomers to be on the look for.Overall, A Place Beyond the Pines is an excellent crime saga that is unique in many ways. Many people complain about the ending, but I thinking the ending was appropriate. It is certainly a discussion-starter. This film is full of surprises and has enough action and drama to please movie buffs and casual moviegoers alike. Not only this is an excellent film, it's an intelligent one. I am now excited for the future of Derek Cianfrance. I rate this film 9/10.",The Place Beyond the Pines
42,lesleyharris30,"Stellar Storytelling,",9,6 August 2016,"The Place Beyond the Pines is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and a stunning cast. It was a risky way of telling a story, as we follow several different characters in various periods of time, there is no lead actor as different people take the spotlight. It was very unique as a result, we see how one occurrence can change and alter many lives, it is quite an eye opener. However, I did find Luke underdeveloped. The screen time Ryan Gosling has is terrific, but because of how secretive and quiet he is we learn very little, I felt underwhelmed by the end. Bradley Cooper is fantastic, essentially the films lead actor in terms of the length he is on screen, he gives a layered performance of a police officer struggling to forget about the past and deal with the present. It was an underrated performance that deserved an Oscar nomination. Deatailed, clever writing, honest, sincere performances and an tense story, The Place Beyond the Pines is certainly worth the watch for anyone looking for a good drama or crime film. The lives of a motorcycle stunt driver, a dedicated police officer and their sons intersect over the period of several years. Best Performance: Bradley Cooper",The Place Beyond the Pines
43,secondtake,Serious and seriously interesting crime love drama...,7,21 April 2013,"The Place Beyond the Pines (2013)A serious movie with big, human intentions. It's about men, mostly, and boys. And therefore about rivalry and trust and reconciling their past with their present. It's intensely acted and made to be a gritty, realistic, working class cut of upstate New York (set and photographed in Schenectady, near where I live). In a way it's the plain realism of the scenes and the straight up acting that holds it together. The plot is powerful, as well, and the movie does at times really soar. At other times it is over-ambitious, which is a polite way of saying it drags, and it relies on a couple of unlikely turns of fate and on decisions that make it wobble slightly.The opening is a seriously cinematic, gorgeous long take following the Ryan Gosling character, Luke, as he dresses and then approaches the tent in a carnival where he is part of a motorcycle act. The movement, color, lights, noise, and practically smells of the scene are alive. And this sets him up as a bigger than life hunk on the fringe of society. We soon learn (at the same time he does) he has a child in town (from having stopped by a year before). This gets him to quit his act and stay in town.But he has to win over the woman, who has a new man in her life, and find a job to buy her things. Which leads to meeting a guy in the woods who hatches a plan to rob a bank.Without giving away that fast exciting part of the movie, it's important to place the other lead male, Avery (Bradley Cooper), a young cop who has a violent showdown with Luke. And Avery also has a young child, which creates the parallel that apparently haunts him even as he becomes a local hero cop.The final act of the movie is a jump forward to the lives of the two sons, now party crazy kids in high school. And in a fictional coincidence that's storytelling economy but also a bit stretched, the two have a huge confrontation of their own. And the two fathers, in different ways, are dragged into the drama from the perspective of the kids.I say this is a movie about men because the one woman (Eva Mendes) with any part at all is Luke's girlfriend and she has little to do but react to what happens around her. Avery's wife has a smaller (and actually more difficult) part, but it is equally reactive to what her husband has done. In fact, in terms of action, the other men in the story, such as a group of corrupt cops (including a great Ray Liotta) are given more active roles. And it's this part of the plot that eventually layers on top of a political and moral story around the police department. There's a lot going on here and it might seem it deserves well over two hours. But not so. There is no obvious gratuitous excess here, but there is a sense of lingering, or repeating points, and of including needless nuances that make the movie feel as long as it and then some. It's a good drama, straight up stuff with some dramatic edges. The photography has some sterling moments, though not consistently throughout (it could have been an evocative masterpiece had the best photography been sustained). And the story, whatever the clichés it is working off of, is complex and interesting enough to work. Let's hope for the director's cut, with a half an hour removed--I wish.",The Place Beyond the Pines

Going from stunt man to bank robber. His life of crime puts him on a course with Avery (Cooper), a police officer trying to do the right thing. The meeting of these two changes two families in ways that no one can see coming. This is a hard movie to review. I must first start by saying that this was nothing at all like what I expected. I will try and do this without trying to give anything away. The movie is almost like three mini movies in one. First 45 min deals with Luke, then switches to Avery and finally their children. I expected this to be more of a type of cat and mouse movie, it isn't. The movie deals with one event that links and defines not only the two involved but also the families of the robber and cop. This is not a movie you can just put in and watch, this is one that makes you think and wonder who is right and wrong. This is not a movie for everyone and if you are looking for a fast paced action thriller this is not it. This is more of an art house type drama that shows how one decision can change your life.

I'm not sure a guy like me can give it proper justice either. It's honestly one of the most thought provoking films I've seen in some time. I get a bit down on Hollywood sometimes. With all the remakes, sequels, etc. It's really nice to see unique subject matter once in a while. Place Beyond the Pines is a breath of fresh air in so many ways. The events that take place in this movie are entwined together, and it all makes sense in the end. It's just masterfully crafted storytelling at its finest, with so many curve balls thrown at you. Even when the movie goes in a different direction in the second half, it still carries over the events that took place in the first half as well. I was just emotionally spent after this was over (In a good way of course) my brain hurt from thinking so much. Ryan Gosling is one of Hollywood's most dependable actors these days. I felt for his predicament in a big way. It also helps that his character was realistic as well. I love the Gosling. Bradley Cooper is also one of my favorites. His character does a few things I disagree with, but I also managed to feel for him as well. Despite his self righteous nature some times, and being an absentee father, he was likable. It's one of Bradley's best performances. Ray Liotta, Eva Mendes, and Rose Byrne add tremendous support. I do have a couple of minor carps with this movie. 1. It does go a little bit too long. 2. I expected a better emotional payoff than I received from this movie. It just felt a little abrupt when all was said and done. I felt they could have done a bit more with it. Other than that, this movie is acesFinal Thoughts: Very hard to write a review for a movie that is filled with so many things that can't be revealed. This is a tremendous movie, and almost a knockout. A bit of trimming and a better payoff would have given this a 10/10. We don't see character driven films like this very often in Hollywood these days, so embrace it. It's an amazing experience, and I can't recommend it enough. Just go see it.

Not to be told in a quick line, Cianfrance takes extra effort to move the audience with his deep characters, surpassing locations & brilliant writing. The story-line isn't new, but the improvisation & tactical direction is amazing. This cannot be categorized in a single genre. It ranges from crime to drama to thriller to what-not.Ryan Gosling is good but Bradley Cooper is great. Eva Mendes impresses me with her apt expressions throughout the movie. Mendelsohn is great, Liotta is great & everyone related to is just great with their character portrayal. Music is brilliant with some nice OST songs, screenplay is good with appreciable classification, cinematography is amazing while editing passes. Very few movies come out which touch you without boring a bit telling a story of two decades in 150 minutes. Fantastic!BOTTOM LINE: Not for everyone, TPBTP is cruel, thrilling & well-crafted. Climax is good; enhanced movie-watching experience. Looking more from Cianfrance. 7.5/10 for the story being clichéd. But kudos for touching such a hot topic.

There were no psychos in this movie, it was pure dramatised for the time being the characters constantly gives the screen space to another and new character. Thus, the new story begins with the new character, more like the layers within.The movie opens with Ryan Gosling-Eva Mendes combo and transforms to Bradley Cooper-Rose Byrne and then again to two young boys. In their limited time span both Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper gives one of the best performances ever, the young and hot Hollywood property at present.

This segment tweaked my interest more than the first segment did, and offered several twists and surprises. Cooper is fantastic here. Interesting how no-one ever really considers the consequences of a cop's actions. This film illustrates it incredibly well. In this instance, it also shows the repercussions of their actions.In the third segment, the stunt rider's son from the first segment, and the cop's son from the second segment, takes over the lead. This segment has way too much swearing and smoking considering the tender age of the characters, but I suppose it could very well be relevant nowadays.

52,Floated2,Several Great Plot Twists and Turns,8,21 August 2014,"The Place Beyond the Pines has a unique movie feel and structure which is similar to watching three separate but interconnecting films.Director Cianfrance (Blue Valentine) kicks things off with what is easily the best of the bunch as we're introduced to Luke Glanton (Gosling), a motorcycle stunt driver who reconnects with a former one- night stand named Romina (Eva Mendes) at the local fair where he plies his trade. When he learns that Romina has given birth to his son, Luke agrees to quit his nomadic job and stay in town, even though Romina has already moved on with another man. Determined to do his fatherly duties and provide for his son, Luke decides to put his unique skills to use and start robbing banks, placing him on a collision course with rookie policeman Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper), an honest family man who gave up his promising career as a lawyer to serve on the force. After becoming privy to some dirty cops in the department, however, Avery must decide what's more important: his integrity or loyalty to his brothers in blue.Taking place 15 years later, the final act is predictable but nonetheless rewarding as Cianfrance's story comes full circle to find Luke and Avery's teenage sons (Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen, respectively) become unlikely friends during a chance meeting, ultimately forced to deal with the actions of their fathers. The whole thing is incredibly ambitious, and unfortunately for Cianfrance, he seems to have bitten off more than he can chew. Though there's not much to each story, everything that happens is necessary to telling the larger narrative, and that's part of what makes ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" so frustrating. Cianfrance may be dealing with some familiar themes of fatherhood, consequences and destiny, but it's such an epic undertaking that it ultimately becomes too much movie for its own good.Gosling's segment is the standout, not only because it lays the groundwork for the rest of the film, but because it provides the best balance of drama, action, and even a little comedy thanks to an entertaining turn from Ben Mendelsohn, who's fast becoming one of the best character actors in Hollywood. The heist scenes are also well shot and add some much-needed energy to a film that moves at a rather leisurely pace, but the biggest reason for its success is Gosling's magnetic performance.",The Place Beyond the Pines
53,eddie_baggins,Comes close to greatness,9,3 October 2013,"It's hard to picture a more ambitious, sprawling and unconventional film from America this year than PBTP. Director Cianfrance here follow's up his raw, emotional and downright great debut feature Blue Valentine with this epic and confident crime/drama that refuses to follow the normal pattern set out by modern day movies.The more known about the story that Cianfrance has crafted here the less power it has upon first watch so it would be remiss of me to spoil to much about the structure of this multilayered tale. What can be said about the story without ruining the arc created is at the heart of the film lays a touching and believable portrait of both fathers and sons and how one person's decision/action can reverberate throughout time. To tell this tale in a meaningful fashion Cianfrance needed a great cast on board in top form and on that front it truly delivers.Again collaborating with Gosling after his unflattering turn in Blue Valentine Cianfrance draws a memorable screen incarnation from the heartthrob in is portrayal of lost soul Luke but it's in the supports where PBTP really shines. From Eva Mendes blue collar girl Romina, Ben Mendelsohn's (talk about being on a career roll!) lonely mechanic Robin and great young actor Dane DeHaan's angry teen Jason every actor has a moment to shine even the oft lost in not caring Ray Liotta gives one of his more memorable recent performances. Credit must go to both Cianfrance's directing and storytelling technique for these outcomes.PBTP is a professionally crafted, beautifully shot, hauntingly scored, well-acted and impressively realistic film that should be commended for its lofty ambition and it's scarily close to its goals final result. While somewhat diminished by its own unique tonal shifting and structure there is no denying that what we have here is a director in charge of his medium and a willingness to try new things with it.

In the summary, it says something about the place in the woods where they find refuge, but to be honest, they hardly ever went there. The performances were good, probably the only thing that saved the movie from hitting rock bottom, as the story doesn't unfold as well as it would have been expected. I mean, it's a good drama in theory, but it fails to deliver. In the end, what did the movie had to say? That the sins of the parents are burdens of their children? That one can't escape their fate? Maybe that there is an authority problem in the police system. Anyway, the first part of the movie was better than the second one (the one that limped into the future fifteen years later).

55,leonblackwood,First half was brilliant but then it goes downhill. 4/10,4,11 August 2013,"Review: This first hour of this movie was great, with Ryan Gosling playing his usual deep and mystical self, but the second half of the movie was really disappointing. I enjoyed the storyline, at the beginning, and the chemistry between the characters worked well, but when the second half of the film kicks in, it just turns out to be an average movie that drags. I understand that the director was trying to show that everything that happens in people's life has a domino effect, but I switched off during the second half. It seemed like the movie was directed by 2 people and it could have easily been made into 2 separate movies, but that's not to say that the actors didn't put in good performances, especially Gosling who suited his part well. Average!Round-Up: This movie really does prove that Ryan Gosling is at the top of his game because his acting style was made for this role. Bradley Cooper played is part well but his character wasn't that great. We've all seen Ray Liotta play this type of role before in movie like Cop Land, but he's not in the movie for that long. I don't know why directors are making films so long nowadays because there is so much unnecessary footage in this film. When the kids get introduced into the movie, it took away the whole zest from the beginning and I was wondering what direction the movie was going to go into next. By the end of the film, I felt a bit cheated because of the excited from the beginning.Budget: $15million Worldwide Gross: $36millionI recommend this movie to people who like there deep dramas about a cop and a bank robber. 4/10",The Place Beyond the Pines
56,howard.schumann,A suspenseful and gripping multi-layered drama,9,5 December 2013,"When you are somewhere in the middle of it, a great film like a great book often has a quality that may feel random and unfocused, devoid of structure or meaning. It is only when completed that you can impose on it a retroactive unity and see an aspect of its design that has not been apparent. Such is the case with Derek Cianfrance's The Place Beyond the Pines, a suspenseful and gripping multi-layered drama that covers fifteen years in the life of its protagonists (Bradley Cooper and Ryan Gosling). A cautionary tale about the need to give up our bravura posturing and communicate our pain to others before the ripple effect of our actions can no longer be contained, it is a sprawling epic whose power can be better appreciated in its totality.Set in a working class area of Schenectady, New York, the film opens as Luke Glanton (Ryan Gosling), a brawny, tattooed man with bleached blond hair is performing a daredevil feat at a traveling carnival along with two other riders. They race around and past each other, often upside down in a metal cage defying gravity. Even though he is soft spoken with eyes that look right through you, Luke is tightly wound and always seems ready to erupt. While in town, he visits ex-girlfriend Romina (Eva Mendes), a waitress he once had an affair with, only to discover that he is the father of her little boy named Jason.Feeling drawn once again to Romina even though she is now living with a new man, Kofi (Mahershala Ali), Luke takes a low-paying job as a mechanic working with Robin (Ben Mendelsohn), a reformed bank robber, to make extra money to support his family. Unable to resist the temptation, Luke and Robin team up and begin to rob banks until a traumatic confrontation with a rookie cop, Avery (Bradley Cooper) causes a drastic change in direction and Cooper's character now becomes the film's focus. Though no one can match the charisma of Gosling and the film does not maintain its high level of intensity throughout, each part of the film is engaging and powerfully-realized in its own way, utilizing an impressive ensemble cast that depicts real human beings, not cardboard cutouts.Though Avery, with tons of ambition hidden beneath an outwardly calm demeanor, is celebrated as a hero, he must contend with his own feelings of remorse for an action performed in the line of duty as well as with having to deal with a corrupt cop, Deluca (Ray Liotta), who recruits him to help in his illegal acts. When DeLuca shows up with friends at Avery's house without an invitation, the undercurrent of tension is palpable despite the camaraderie. The film then hurtles forward fifteen years when Luke and Avery's volatile and alienated sons, AJ and Jason, played to perfection by Emory Cohen and Dane DeHaan, are now teenagers at the same high school without knowledge of their past connection.As the two boys grapple for some understanding of the circumstances that brought them together, the film has comes full circle, beginning and ending with a man on a motorcycle. One is going around and around in a cage while the other is going straight ahead towards an unknown destination with a new feeling of confidence and an air of transcendence.",The Place Beyond the Pines
57,Turfseer,"Watchable, but Schenectady 'epic' has a few too many false notes",5,12 June 2014,"The film's title is loosely based on a Native American name for Schenectady, New York, where the story takes place. Director Derek Cianfrance's effort represents an improvement over his prior blue collar soap opera, 'Blue Valentine'. Here, his story is more ambitious, a triptych of sorts, focusing on a group of interconnected characters.In Part 1 of 3, the strongest of the three stories, Ryan Gosling is Luke Blanton, a 'bad boy' motorcycle stuntman who quits his job in order to raise his one year old son who he fathered with a former flame, Romina. Much to his chagrin, she's now involved with another man, Kofi, and wants nothing to do with him. Luke soon befriends Robin, a former bank robber and now owner of a small auto repair business, who suggests that a good way to provide for his son, is to rob banks. Gosling does a fine job in depicting our resident psychopath as he goes about terrorizing bank customers and brutally assaulting Romina's boyfriend with a wrench after he brings a crib over for the baby at the boyfriend's residence (the assault results in Luke's arrest). Everything is rationalized in the name of being a 'good father' and Luke's violent behavior keeps escalating. When Robin wants out of the bank robbery business he dismantles Luke's motorcycle but Luke sticks a gun in his mouth and confiscates the bail money which Robin had laid out.Part 2 (not as good as Part 1) begins when Luke reaches the end of the line after being caught in the act of his final bank robbery. He ends up in a residential home where we're introduced to the new protagonist, PO Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper), who shoots Luke before he gets his own shot off, hitting Cross in the knee. Luke then falls out the window and bleeds to death on the pavement below.There seems to be some question as to whether Avery was justified in shooting Luke, especially because he gave him no chance to surrender. At the same time, things happened so fast, that Avery probably had a good case in arguing the shooting was completely justified, since it was quite probable that Luke was armed and could have shot him right away (and as it turned out, Luke indeed was armed and did fire his gun, but only after Avery shot him first). As it turns out, an internal police investigation exonerates Avery but he remains guilt-ridden simply because he killed a fellow human being. Avery even tells a police psychologist that he can't stop thinking about Luke's son when he looks at his own son. It seems odd that Avery would go along with the two crooked fellow officers, Scotty and Deluca, who confiscate Luke's bank robbery stash from underneath Romina's son's crib. They gave him the lion's share and we soon find out why Avery goes along: he offers Romina all of his share back, but she refuses. What happens next didn't seem believable at all. Avery decides to rat out his fellow officers by going to the chief of police. Now why wouldn't Avery realize that the chief of police is just as bad as his fellow officers and would end up telling them about his decision to report their illegal actions? This is borne out when Deluca asks Avery to follow him in his car and he complies, until it suddenly dawns on him (duh!), this is an ambush (wouldn't anyone with any common sense have figured out what was going down?).Avery seemingly has a way out when he records another officer who's trying to steal drugs from the police property room where Avery is now relegated to. Avery uses the tape to blackmail the DA who is forced to prosecute all the corrupt cops. We're asked to flash forward 15 years but wouldn't Avery still be in danger? Yes, all the cops have been jailed but I'm sure they have plenty of friends in town who might want to get back at him (and what about when the cops get out of jail later on?). So again, would any normal person put their trust in a police chief who is suspect from the get-go?Part 3 focuses on Avery's teenage son, AJ who unknowingly befriends Luke's son, Jason, while they're students together in high school. AJ's parents are now divorced and he appears to be severely influenced by gang culture. Unfortunately, there's only one scene which shows the interaction between father and son (Avery confronts AJ after he's arrested for assaulting Jason). So why did AJ turn out the way he did? Not explained. We're asked to assume that Avery's quest to become state attorney keeps him away from acting as a good parent.Even less convincing is Jason's quest to take revenge on Avery. He never had any connection to Luke and only learns about him from talking to Robin and reading old newspaper clippings. Furthermore, Romina and Kofi appear to have been good parents. I can see why he wants to get back at AJ (whose initial assault on him was particularly brutal) but why Avery? Perhaps it's just a teenager's impulsivity but Avery's reaction where he gets down on his knees and begs forgiveness just seems over the top. It goes all the way back to when Avery shot Luke—should he have felt that guilty? To my mind, he was doing his job as a police officer; and had Luke not robbed banks and broken into someone's house, Avery would not have had to shoot Luke in the first place.Director Cianfrance aims high here and manages to keep one's interest throughout. Nonetheless, only the first story, the chronicle of the psychopath Luke, proves compelling. Avery and the two boys are not developed well enough and let's not even discuss the female characters. 'Pines' is no masterpiece but is still worth a look!",The Place Beyond the Pines
58,billcr12,The Sins of the Fathers,7,10 May 2013,"The structure here is unusual, not only because there are three separate and distinct segments, but also because the final third takes place fifteen years ahead of the first two. Ryan Gosling is Luke, a tattooed, motorcycle stunt man who reconnects with Romina(Eva Mendes), a waitress with a baby who turns out to be his son from a brief encounter. Luke decides to try to be a father to the boy and reestablish a relationship with Romina. The bike gig pays little, and so he robs banks and escapes on his bike to make quick cash to impress Romina. He has an encounter with a policeman, Avery(Bradley Cooper), which leads into the second story involving Avery's rise in the department. He is ambitious, and his power trip comes at a great cost. The last part is less interesting than the first two, and I was not thrilled with the sudden time shift forward. Without giving it away, I will only use the phrase, ""the sins of the fathers"" to describe it. Overall, the film works due to excellent performances by Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, and later on by Dane Dehaan and Emory Cohen as troubled high school students. A bit long at two hours and twenty minutes, it is still a 7.5/10.",The Place Beyond the Pines
59,BeneCumb,"Some interesting angles and approaches, but generally rather uninviting",7,13 May 2013,"In fact, there are 3 movies in 1, with only one main character (Avery Cross) linking all of them - and not fully. The issues like parental responsibility, guilt/remorse and fluctuation of value are pictured too obviously here, although within the context and illegal - how far is a father justified to go to raise his child? After a protracted start, the events start to roll, bringing along several predictable solutions, and leading to a trivial end emanating from beginning scenes... And when 15 years passed, the characters looked like basically the same - saving in make-up artists?!The cast, however, is rather strong, although Ryan Gosling has to play a stolid character again (Luke Glanton). Bradley Cooper is pleasant as usual, Eva Mendes, Ray Liotta and Ben Mendelsohn give smaller, but memorable performances. The younger generation seemed quite mediocre to me: in my opinion, neither Dane DeHaan nor Emory Cohen were good at depicting 17-year-olds (they were years over 20 at the time of shooting). Therefore, I have ambivalent attitudes towards this movie; it was not up to my earlier expectations. But I am sure the actors included would provide a decent box office.",The Place Beyond the Pines
60,PWNYCNY,Another stupendous performance by Bradley Cooper.,10,6 April 2013,"Nowadays when Hollywood attempts to make a movie that is story-driven, that is, it is the story that is meant to grab the audience's interest, then the results usually are murky. Let's face it, the art of storytelling has been downplayed in favor of other gimmicks to grab an audience's attention. Nevertheless, this movie succeeds at telling a story. This movie is about a man who lives a lie and knows that he is living a lie and how that lie has trans-generational consequences. The theme of this movie is that it is better to be truthful than deceitful because the truth sooner or later will emerge. In this movie Bradley Cooper proves once again that he is beyond question the best male lead actor in Hollywood today. He performs drama equally as well as comedy. He brings a mixture of strength, pathos and vulnerability to the role without making it seem contrived or hokey. Through Cooper the story acquires an added level of strength which makes the movie not only watchable, but something that makes the audience want more.",The Place Beyond the Pines

62,meeza,Cool place to be!!!,9,28 April 2013,"I decided to see ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" in a Broward County Theatre because it had to be in a place beyond the Pembroke Pines. OK, some of you who unbelievably are still reading this, and are not from South Florida are totally lost. No worries but please keep reading. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is a strong picture that is brilliantly directed by Derek Cianfrance. The movie is set in three different acts. The first one features Ryan Gosling as Luke, a motorcycle stunt rider who discovers that he is a father due to a past fling he had with Romina played by Eva Mendes. Romina visits Luke in a stunt show he was performing in her town, and consequently Romina's mother informs Luke ""I am your father!!!"", I mean ""You are a father"". Luke, delighted that he is a dad, desperately tries to obtain funds to support his son. The problem is that Romina is with someone else, an African American named Kofi; and from the looks of it she is not willing to take a Kofi break. Nevertheless, Romina is still attracted to Luke. In a desperate state, Luke decides to go into the line of bank robbery, inspired by the idea from his new friend Robin Hood; kidding, just Robin. So then Batman decides to enter the pines. OK, refocus!! I mean Luke and Robin start robbing a few banks. Luke does the gritty work in the bank and rides off in his motorbike, while Robin waits for him in his getaway truck. The second act of the picture focuses on Avery; a police officer that had a heavy hand in an incident with Luke. Avery is portrayed by Bradley Cooper, who in this playbook portrays Avery as a decent family man, but at the same time takes advantage of a dire situation to move up from rookie cop to elected official. The third act of the ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" fixates on both Luke & Avery's teenage sons, Jason & A.J. To divulge into that act, would be a committing an excruciating act of cinematic spoiler; which would put me in a place beyond the movie crime with many of you, so I will hold off. The third act of the movie is not as powerful and authentic as the first two; and was way too coincidental for my taste, but it did not detract too much from the film's effectiveness. Cianfrance excelled in his craftsmanship of ""The Place Beyond the Pines"", and I hope it's not forgotten in the place of the academy minds in next year's Oscars. The screen writing team of Ben Coccio, Darius Marder, and Cianfrance delivered a strong script not so much in dialogue, but in storytelling. Gosling was brilliant again, and continues to demonstrate that he is one of the best actors working in today's motion picture industry. Cooper was steady with his work as Avery, and yet delivers another good performance that demonstrates his acting range. Eva Mendes' whopper of a performance as Romina was the most surprising part of this picture; not to degrade Mendes, but I have never been impressed with her filmography in the past; but without a doubt, her Romina conquers all her past work. There was also a place for effective supporting turns in ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" from Ben Mendelsohn as Robin, which I must say Mendelsohn continues to perfect the character of a creepy hoodlum lowlife in yet another movie; and from Ray Liotta as a crooked cop. I think you should place a viewing of ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" in your daily itinerary, and I promise you that you will be in a pleased place. ***** Excellent",The Place Beyond the Pines
63,estebangonzalez10,A powerful and provocative novelistic film,9,28 May 2013,"¨If you ride like lightning, you're going to crash like thunder.¨The Place Beyond the Pines is director Derek Cianfrance's follow up to his critically acclaimed drama Blue Valentine which also happened to star Ryan Gosling. I personally never have seen Blue Valentine, so this was the first time I ever watched one of Cianfrance's films and I have to admit that I was blown away by this epic drama. It may have its flaws, but the film is tremendously powerful and sticks with you long after the credits role. This isn't an easy watch either as it is a 140 minute movie with a lot of character development, but it has some very entertaining and thrilling moments that make the film go by rather quickly. I never found a dull moment in this film and although it shifts gears several times each part of the film hooked me and left me wanting more. Cianfrance delivers one of the year's best films thanks to some great performances from Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, and newcomer Emory Cohen. Ryan Gosling give a similar performance to the one he gave in Drive, where his character doesn't say much but acts really tough and cool. This time around he is an experienced motorcycle driver. This epic film can be divided in three parts, and in my opinion the first 40 minutes might be the best part of the film where Gosling absolutely shines and the film works more like a suspenseful thriller. In the second segment, the film focuses on Bradley Cooper and we get to see him play his useful charismatic self. This was probably the weakest part of the film for me, but it ends with a bang in the third segment where we are introduced to the main character's sons 15 years later and we get to see how their family's legacy influences their lives and decisions. Both Emory Cohen and Dane DeHaan give some strong performances here. This last part might feel a bit rushed and I could have used some 20 more minutes of their story, but it was great nonetheless. I was really hooked with this movie and look forward to seeing some of Cianfrance's previous work.The story takes place in Schenectady, New York where Luke (Ryan Gosling) is just passing by along with the carnival as he works as one of the motorcycle drivers in the globe of death. He happens to share a connection with the small town as his former lover, Romina (Eva Mendes), lives there. They exchange a short dialogue after his act and he offers to take her home. He discovers that she has had his kid but is now living with another man. Growing up without a father has affected Luke's life so he decides he wants to be around for his kid despite Romina not wanting him around. Luke quits the carnival and decides to stay in town working for a mechanic named Robin (Ben Mendelsohn). He wants to provide for his son, but the money isn't enough so Luke is easily convinced by Robin to begin robbing banks. The two form a duo that involves Luke robbing the bank and driving off as fast as he can in his motorcycle while Robin waits for him in a truck where they can easily hideout and escape. They begin to have success, but Robin isn't sure they should continue to do heists as often as they do. Luke decides to continue on his own and that is where his path is connected to Officer Avery's (Bradley Cooper), an ambitious police officer who works in a department full of corrupt cops. And yes Ray Liotta plays yet another corrupt detective once again. The film shifts its focus in this second part on Avery and his relation with the police department and his family, specifically with his wife, Jennifer (Rose Byrne) and his supportive father Al (Harris Yulin). The final segment takes place 15 years later and it involves the relationship that Luke and Avery's sons have with each other.The film is ambitious but I think it manages to capture several issues in a very powerful away. Some of the things that the director is dealing with here seem to be the importance of a father figure (or lack thereof) in your life, and how the mistakes of our past continue to catch up with us in our generations to come. It is not an easy thing to tackle these issues in such a short time, but the film really felt like a novel and many of the images were left unsaid for the viewer to interpret on their own. The film has a very strong screenplay, some very powerful performances, and several dark dramatic turns. It is also very beautiful to look at despite the film noir look. I really found this to be a wonderful film and one I had to pay close attention to as the events unraveled before the screen. I especially liked the first 40 minutes of the film and the final 20, but I think it worked really well as a cohesive and connected story.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",The Place Beyond the Pines

Several five-letter words can be made by rearranging the letters in the word ""p-i-n-e-s."" Spine is one such word, as in, the character Luke (played by Ryan Gosling) showed a lot of spine in the way he rode his motor bikes in the three-man death cage, or as getaway vehicles from his bank robberies. In a more negative fashion, you could say the character Avery (played by Bradley Cooper) showed a lot of spine by the way he overcame his brief good-boy qualms to out-racketeer the rest of crooked law enforcement in Schenectady, NY to become King of the Dung Hill (a more realistic story line than Luke's).

66,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Incredibly ambitious film,8,18 July 2016,"Derek Cianfrance's The Place Beyond The Pines is so ambitious in reaching for its themes, it almost seems godlike in its depictions of paternal archetypes. Even gods fall though, and this is a film that grandly shows us the flaws in two very different fathers, how those qualities and the actions they generate can cause damaging rifts for their offspring and those around them years later. Cianfrance seems intent on tackling difficult subject matters with each new film he makes, spiraling systematically into the heart of human behaviour, and mine for the answers to questions which mean so much to him. Mental illness and love were areas he explored prior to this, and now he takes on fatherhood, fateful missteps included. The film is separated into two distinct and very different episodes. We begin somewhere in the 1980's with Luke Crash (Ryan Gosling) an adrenaline junkie motocross daredevil who is all about little talk, lots of impulse and low rationality. He's drawn along by a petty criminal (Ben Mendelsohn, superb) on a series of increasingly risky bank robberies, with notions of providing for his wife (Eva Mendes) and infant child. He takes it too far though, and tragedy strikes with the arrival of Avery (Bradley Cooper), a gung ho young police officer who suddenly finds himself in the hot seat after being branded a hero cop. The film then makes a jarring leap in both time and tone to present day. Avery is now a political candidate with powerful friends and some nasty secrets that gave him his position. He has a son (Emory Cohen) who's on a rocky road of difficult behaviour, estranged and distant from him. Fate steps in and places Luke's own son (Dane DeHaan) in the mix for a very volatile and prophetic outcome that brings the big picture into full circle. My favourite part of the film is the first segment, particularly the interaction between Mendelsohn and Gosling, and their dynamic. It's so organic and unforced, everything happening with the cadence and pace that I recognize in my own life. That's realism. It's moody, ponderous and has an atmosphere thicker than most films dream of. It's somewhat strangled by the abrupt change halfway through, but it's simply one door in the narrative leading into a new room, and is necessary once I thought about it more. What the film has to day about fathers and sons isn't your garden variety family drama message. There's a near Shakespearian darkness to it, the cloak of inevitability laid down by a few lightning quick moments in one's life that arch out through the years and affect ones children in ways that were never contemplated in that one split second it took to act. Rough stuff, but endlessly fascinating. Ray Liotta does his patented corrupt dick head cop thing nicely, Rose Byrne quietly plays Cooper's wife, and look out for Bruce Greenwood and Harris Yulin as well. After the titanic undertaking he has striven for here, I can't wait to see what Cianfrance has in store for us next. Powerful stuff.",The Place Beyond the Pines
67,3xHCCH,Three Movies in One,6,12 June 2013,"The Place Beyond the Pines is a drama about two men and their sons, but this story was told in three distinct acts. In essence these are three short movies with a very tenuous connection, making one very long movie.The first short film was about Luke, a motorcycle stuntman, who turned to robbing banks when he learned he had a son from a previous girlfriend (Eva Mendez). This segment could have been just so-so if not for the intense performance of Ryan Gosling as Luke. That scene during the baptism of his son Jason was very moving. It is just that this is basically the same Ryan Gosling we saw in ""Drive"" and ""Blue Valentine."" He is good, but he seems to be doing the same character over and over.The second short film was about Avery, a lawyer turned cop. After being honored as a hero for killing a thief, he gets involved with some bad cops into extortion and drugs. He uses this sticky situation to his advantage to become assistant DA. I barely recognized Bradley Cooper as the young cop at first as his entrance was not too grand for a billed star. While Cooper was good as Avery, this story was simply so commonplace and undistinguished.The third film was about the misadventures of two young men whose fathers just happened to be connected with each other, and the two previous stories. The unlikeliness of this event happening was what made this installment rather unstable. By this time the film had already gone too long for so little to be happening. This could have been a better film despite the common stories had judicious editing been done to shorten the film to its essence.

There is an intensity to the way he takes on his roles. Luke is another memorable entry in his list, one that could easily earn him a supporting Oscar nod. This is the only complain about the film: there is not enough of him. However, don't expect to be disappointed by anything else; every other performer here is wonderful, from the young actors to the seasoned professionals. Every part has been written with care and insight. Eva Mendez might not have many lines, but the director makes sure her contributions are fully appreciated. Expect Liotta to leave a mark here, too.In ""Pines"", one see a drama, similar to the Classical Greek plays, where people's interactions can only be described as dramatic and consequential. Luke has a fling with Romina, and these two manage not to communicate, complicate their situation by having a child, and Luke's impulsive nature eventually leads him to a tragic conclusion. This is where the high drama begins, as a rookie cop gets involved, and he learns that life is a very complicated series of complex struggles.As time passes, this cop moves on and becomes very successful, but his son, and Luke's son soon cross path, and because of their respective parents, there's no way this is going to be resolved easily. We expect the conclusion to be explosive. Cooper does even better work than the ""Linings"", and if he keeps it up, we can expect great things in his future.You will remain glued to your seat, waiting to get to the conclusion of a film that feels both fresh and a reminder of what classic Hollywood drama used to be like.

70,aidanratesmovies,"Overly ambitious and slow at times, but not without its stronger moments",7,9 May 2020,"Starts out strong, but ultimately loses its steam, The Place Beyond the Pines is a well directed and well acted flick, unfortunately bogged down by slow pacing and an over-ambitious nature. The film is very well cast, and very well acted, with Ryan Gosling's performance as Luke proving to be quite a memorable character and experience to watch. Other shoutouts go to Ben Mendelsohn, Eva Mendes, and Dane DeHaan, who also provide some quite great performances, especially Mendelsohn who is fantastic in every scene that he takes part in. The film is very well directed, with some stunningly beautiful and poignant cinematography, fit with some truly remarkable shots and points of view that prove to be one of the strongest, and most consistent aspects of the film in total. The film starts out very strong, with Gosling's role taking charge, but as the story begins to grow and change about halfway through, the film takes a dive in its pacing, and becomes far too slow to be enjoyable. The sudden change in pacing, and lack of interest in familiar plotlines proves to put the film in an awkward position. It starts out ambitious, but ends rather averagely, with its ambitious nature still trying to take charge throughout its overlong runtime, but it losing charge more and more as it goes on. It's tropes and plot twists can be unique at times, but the plotline seems to dragged out for them to prove to be of much worth. It can be very unique at times, with director Derek Cianfrance providing a very rich sense of atmosphere and tone throughout, but unfortunately the writing can undermine his hard work on the screen, and end up seeming flatter than it should be. In the end, The Place Beyond the Pines has some very impressive aspects throughout, most notably its cinematography and Gosling and Mendelsohn's performance's, but ultimately has too many flaws in pacing and other aspects to keep it from being the truly ambitious and great film it could have been and still tries to be.

Smelling a rat, Luke goes back to her home the next day to find grandmother holding the baby.Luke is the standard Gosling's character: inarticulate, dumb, asocial. He has no money, but insists to support the baby, even if nobody asked for it. So Luke starts robbing banks to be able to throw cash at Romina and their baby. One day Luke invades Kofi's house, allegedly to assemble a crib for the baby and during the proceedings he manages to anger Romina, scare the baby and smash Kofi's face.Bailed from jail, where he rightly ended, and advised to keep a low profile, Luke decides the time is ripe for another bank robbery. End of part one and enough to put me off.We are supposed to sympathize with the selfish and idiotic character of Luke, just because he is a father. It seemed more like he wanted to impose his presence where nobody wanted or needed him. Except that Romina dragged Luke in again, after the two of them ignored each other for a year, so maybe she wanted him, but not really. whatever.Part two is shorter and about Avery, the cop (also a father) who stops Luke and part three takes place 15 years later, when Luke and Avery's sons meet and collide. Neither Avery's or Luke's sons are particularly sympathetic, but they should be excused for being brats because they have daddy issues. Anyway, by the time the appear on the scene I had enough of the whole story.The moral of the movie could be that fathers should be excused for robbing banks because they must provide for their children or that robbing banks is OK because the police is corrupted or that kids have the right to be obnoxious drug addicts because their fathers neglected them.",The Place Beyond the Pines
72,AudioFileZ,"The Thread That Binds...Or, Divides.",7,23 May 2013,"Movies that weave seemingly disconnected time lines bringing them somehow together don't always work. It's a heady device when the story doesn't get too mystical and rings true. Such is the case in the smoldering brilliant ""The Place Beyond The Pines"".A conflicted rebel without a cause carnival motorcycle stunt rider extraordinarie finds out on a annual stop in Schnectedy NY that between yearly visits he has a son. Sensing the need to stop, settle down, and take ownership he attempts to force a relationship upon his son's mother. She has made steps toward normalcy having a life with another man. Ryan Gosling as the protagonist in this part of the story is out to which he doesn't quietly slip into the night. Like so many ""not haves"" he thinks money is the answer and by allowing his rebel tendencies he becomes a successful bank robber on 2-wheels. Proving no bridge, the money is a big let-down and without any rational grounding he gets sloppy and is not only caught, but he is shot and killed by a police officer. As if not already in motion, a clearer story starts to evolve - a story in which years later a heavy toll is extracted.The Place Beyond The Pines is a dark story. It is unapologetically so and makes clear far too many of life's decisions, some cognizant others serendipitous, run like a constant thread beyond the here and now ad-infinitum.A powerful, if fictional, story, appropriate stark cinematography, damaged characters that ring true, and the continuum of life meld nicely together to weave a powerful combination of three related stories. A movie well worth your time to see if ultimately a bit unsettling. Ryan Gosling stands out, Bradley Cooper is more than serviceable, and a director with a deft touch in bringing a sad tale to life. Also of note, this is the first time I've seen Mike Patton of ""Faith No More"" fame providing a soundtrack (he may have others?) and it is effective background. Recommended.",The Place Beyond the Pines
73,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Place Beyond the Pines,6,31 May 2014,"As I viewed the first frame of director Derek Cianfrance's The Place Beyond the Pines, I witnessed star Ryan Gosling fiddling about with a switchblade before leaving his dressing room. The camera then tracks him to a state fair circus area where he proceeds to do some daredevil stunt work. I'm not gonna lie. Within the first five minutes, I was pumped to see the rest of this movie. Gosling portrays motorcycle outlaw Luke Glanton and his screen presence is fiercely intimidating. Resembling a young Steve McQueen (not in looks but in stature) and having his own signature ""movie walk"" (it's the same in everything he's in especially Drive), he has the gift of being a great actor while relying on the most minimal amount of dialogue (I'm not sure if I'm right, but I think it's in his contract to be followed with the camera from his backside and not his front side). In ""Pines,"" which is a long, winding film that drifts about into uncharted territory once too often, Gosling's Glanton is only featured in the first half (he inhabits about an hour of screen time). You follow his character hoping that he finds peace of mind with his life choices. Alas, when he leaves the proceedings, the director asks us, the audience, to latch onto another character and then another (each with their own hidden agendas). So here's the gist of it: when watching The Place Beyond the Pines, you begin to realize that this is the movie equivalent of getting in a car, driving to an unknown destination, realizing that you're thousands of miles away, and stopping in the middle of nowhere. Two hours and twenty minutes after viewing it, I figured I was on some kind of meaningless journey (to where I have no clue) instead of fully immersed in an actual, relevant cinematic experience. ""Pines"" doesn't make much of a point and offers no real significance when it comes to its plot descriptions. The fact that it's well directed (lots of tracking shots and some hand held camera stuff), ardently scripted, and evenly scored only frustrates me even more as to the fact that I just can't recommend it.Presenting itself as a three part character study and taking place in two fairly different time periods, ""Pines"" takes a gander at motorcycle stuntman turned bank robber Luke Glanton. He ditches touring around the state of New York to stay in town and befriend an old flame (he robs banks for extra money to support a one year old child he didn't even know about). Then there is police officer Avery Cross (played by Bradley Cooper) who while only a year on the job and in the line of duty, gets shot in the leg and winds up being a hero (he apprehends Glanton). Fast forward 15 year later, and we get a troubled boy (Glanton's grown up son) who searches for any information on the father he never had by resorting to a violent act of kidnapping. All of these characters have serious moral dilemmas. They're all connected in some way either by blood or simple coincidence, and their lives intersect for minutes at a time. This is my biggest complaint with ""Pines."" The film plays like three different stories that all have deadening, superficial loose ends. We are not given a chance to think about and decipher each character because the plot already leads us into the trials and tribulations of another. Like I said earlier, this flick is a journey that leads to nowhere. The fact that it's well done only leads to my continued frustration with it.In hindsight though, The Place Beyond the Pines is a film of utmost originality. If I'm not mistaken, it is cut completely from original cloth (its not based on a story, a book, or true events). But it was difficult for me to decide on who to root for, who to reason with, and who to feel sorry for when it came to the actions of the dissuaded players in the cast. One cast member in particular who had an interesting character motivation, was Luke's friend Robin Van Der Zee (played by Ben Mendelsohn). He persuaded Luke to do the robberies and then cut him off by eventually not helping him escape. Then when Luke's son comes knocking on the door 15 years later, Robin tells him what a great guy Luke was and what an amazing motorcycle rider he became. I don't know about you but this seems pretty hypocritical to me.Honestly, there are three questions you have to ask yourself when viewing this thing: is this film about Glanton's need to take care of his family (his young boy and his forgotten lover played by Eva Mendes) by committing multiple motorcycle robberies, is it about Cooper's character who works on a corrupt police force and wants to break free by becoming New York's youngest district attorney, or is it about Gosling's character's misguided, unloved son who resorts to stealing, kidnapping, and alleged drug dealing to get through the day? I wasn't sure and I couldn't make up my mind on who was the main focus. This is a vehicle that comes off as a set of ideas in search of a major voice. Cianfrance's earlier release, Blue Valentine at least had the audacity to keep the storytelling locked in one area and not have it break off into tangents like he does here. If you choose to see ""Pines,"" see it for its whimsical pace (this film moves at a fast clip for having a 2 and a half hour running time), its decent performances and its raw like tone. Just know that it may leave you ""beyond"" cold in the end.",The Place Beyond the Pines

75,pc95,Might Be OK as a Book,5,7 September 2013,"(spoilers) Directed by Derek Cianfrance, ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" seems like it may have been a decent book (maybe it was based on one - I didn't look), as it's details are fairly involved and sometimes vivid.. But as a movie it didn't work for me, especially as it kept going. Really it meandered badly and failed to hold my attention especially during the ""third"" and final act. It seemed to be bitten by the wandering bug, and the music was monotonous and out-of-place. Too bad, as the movie started out fairly well, especially in the first 3rd with the focus on actors Gosling and Mendes - there was good focus there, but then it keeps going and going, and trying to show meaning where there's none. Unfortunately it's a stumbled missed opportunity. 5/10",The Place Beyond the Pines
76,bob-rutzel-1,Very Good 3 in 1 Entanglements Movie,9,14 August 2013,"Drifter and carnival stunt rider, Luke (Ryan Gosling) is a motorcycle wizard, who discovers he has a son from a previous encounter with Romina (Eva Mendes). He decides to stay and do what he can for his son, Jason. He believes that robbing banks is a good and quick way to do this. Later, Avery (Bradley Cooper) a good cop becomes entangled with corrupt cops. Lastly, the sons of Luke and Avery hook up and discover the truths about their fathers. Not since I saw The EYE of the NEEDLE (great movie btw) have I seen 2-movies within one movie. Well, here we actually have 3- movies within one movie. It's hard to talk about this movie - 2 ½ hours long - without giving too much away. It's long, but I wasn't bored at all. I suppose some scenes could have been cut down some. The pacing is good and the acting all around is first rate to include Eva Mendes as Romina, Ray Liotta as Detective Deluca and Ben Mendelson as Luke's friend, Robin. Jason, Luke's son is played by Dane DeHaan and Avery's son, AJ is played by Emory Cohen and both do credible jobs. I will say that Ryan Gosling does seem to play the same character (with a different name and clothes) in all of his movies, but we really don't mind. It's all good. He always deserves an Oscar. I will assume those tattoos are washable.The first part of this movie is the longest and the strongest. Everything else - later on - hinges on this part because as you watch parts 2 and 3, you can't help thinking of everything in Part 1. It's like a little time-machine for you. The Place Beyond the Pines is a very good movie and the only thing I can think of regarding the title is that when you go beyond the pines you free yourself from all previous entanglements. Hey, it works for me. You can decide what works for you. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.",The Place Beyond the Pines
77,Sergeant_Tibbs,Gives you chills.,8,26 June 2013,"After the raw power of Blue Valentine, Derek Cianfrance singled himself out as a promising auteur for the future of cinema and the plot and trailer for The Place Beyond the Pines seemed to show him living up to it. I knew the film was divisive and although I didn't want to spoil it for myself, I came prepared enough for when the narrative was due to jump from character to character, as I heard that jarred others. Despite being a character sprawling epic, it's a real intimate film and although the thrills and emotion never reach the heights it has the potential for, it's really engaging and interesting, packed full of moral dilemmas. I found myself constantly wondering what the characters were going to do and fascinated by their choices. Besides a few forgivable false notes where I felt the actors just needed another few takes to nail it, the acting was terrific.Even though it can feel like three different films loosely connected, each are very focused and driven, if only they show one side of a character. Ryan Gosling seems to be exploring everywhere his stoic style can take him and makes it work. His portion of the film definitely has the best iconography to take away from here, at first his story reminded me of The Wrestler with that gritty 80s excess feel. Eva Mendes was the best I've seen her, even though she cries in all her scenes, albeit with good reason. Bradley Cooper really has emerged lately as a fantastic actor. I loved him in Silver Linings Playbook and if he can give another great performance, I'll have to call him a favourite. Really glad he has the material to show off his talent now. Even though the only big thrill of the film is the point where the narrative trades Gosling for Cooper, I did find a lot of scenes that gave me chills.It did drag a little in the third section where were many times where I felt they could've summed up the loose ends in a few minutes and wrap it up much more neatly, but I see how Cianfrance wanted it to escalate more. Fortunately the good things I've heard about Dane DeHaan were very true and he carries this section quite well despite the writing letting it down in places. It's the last 10 minutes which it lost me. Not necessarily in the logic of characters decisions but in what the film was trying to say about fathers and sons. I was waiting for it to come to a resolute point but it didn't seem to make it, even though I liked the full circle nature of some plot points. I want to say a bit more focus and a bit more ambition could've made it better, but the film is all focus and ambition. Perhaps it needed a wiser eye to give advice. Cianfrance definitely has the chops for greatness though. I hesitate before calling Pines great, but it's certainly really good.8/10",The Place Beyond the Pines

In the end, I was able to overlook it fairly easily.",The Place Beyond the Pines
79,OJT,When the past come haunting you,8,21 April 2013,"I've seen a lot of movies and has come to appreciate those film which baffles, surprises, makes my head spin or which shows things differently. Then I also get a urge to write and tell about it. The place beyond the pines is such a film. Not perfect, but still very interesting, and above all a recommended one for those loving films.I would guess Derek Cianfrance is a director to watch. He might be a grand director in the making. As far as I know this is his third directed feature picture, besides the documentaries he's done. And with every outing, he becomes way better.I watched his ""Blue Valentine"" only some days ago, since I was planning to pick up this new one at my local cinema, being aware that both has quite a lot of critic's acclamation. Seeing Blue Valentine was great, though it's not my kind of first choice of films. It's a film about love and relations in a long time span. That film is experimenting with the time frame of history telling in a very interesting way, which makes us as viewers more interested in the story.Well, The place beyond the pines is similar in many ways, though telling the story in another way. Again Cianfrance tells the story in an unconventional way. We really don't know what to expect next. That's something I come to love as a film lover. I've seen most and appreciate good told stories. However I love the films surprising me. This does over and over.The film ends way different than it starts, and it takes several routes to go up, which I doesn't follow. But hey - that's life. Also you not knowing everything, or you being able to make up your own hopes or thoughts.Never mind the building up of this story about a stunt driver, getting a kid, wanting to be a good father and starts robbing banks to afford so. The main theme of this film is fatherhood and family relations. An Cianfrance has things to tell. If there's a stripe of gold to find here, then it's the moral of telling the truth. Not only mask up or refine, but telling the plain old truth from the start.This film will sure make people try to get hold of Cianfrance's first feature ""Brother tied"" from 1998. I expect that to be showing some of the freshness of an interesting director, which I think Cianfrance is on the way of becoming.Go see this without reading too much in beforehand. Expexct good or rather exceptional acting in all roles, and then you know that more gold will come from Derek Cianfranc's writing and directing hands.",The Place Beyond the Pines
80,michaeltrivedi,Good Movie,7,24 September 2019,"I thought this movie was really good when I first watched it. It seemed just like a weird vehicle for Ryan Gosling, when he went through that few years of being on top or whatever. He's fun to watch, but he seems a bit weak in real life, which really impacts the way I see him on screen.This movie takes place in three parts, with the first third in my opinion being the best. It tells the tale of bike racing stuntman who has a child, and robs to support him. It tells the tale of the cop who shoots the stuntman. And then it tells the tale of the two children of both these people, and how they become friends.It's a pretty interesting movie. Everything goes smoothly, and it has a punk rock feel to it. It's really edgy and cool, but still conservative. It has the characteristics of a good student imagining himself as a tough guy he sees on screen.I recommend it.7 Stars",The Place Beyond the Pines
81,Screen_Blitz,The Place Beyond the Pines packs a serious punch and very effectively,8,15 November 2015,"This compelling crime-drama reunites Ryan Gosling who left audiences praising in the thriller Drive, with director Derek Cianfrance for the first time since Blue Valentine and hits viewers with a powerful story, arresting performances by its talented cast, and a script filled with surprises. Ryan Gosling plays motorcycle stuntman Luke Glanton who faces an unexpected with his ex-girlfriend Romina (played by Eva Mendes) and their newborn child Jason. In an effort to take matters into his hands by supporting her family, Luke goes a wild bank- robbing spree with the help of an underachieving auto mechanic named Robin (played by Ben Mendelsohn). His criminal activities lead him to cross paths with a rookie officer Avery Cross (played by Bradley Cooper). When the two face off in a violent confrontation, the results lead to both their sons (played by Emory Green and Dane Dehaan) growing up fifteen years later and forming a friendship with ill-fated consequences. This story of this film is told in three interrelated stories connected together and progresses through a turbulent chain of events that set off after an intense climatic scene between the two main characters, and it works very well here. Laboring an inconsistent, yet effectively written script, the film demonstrating some stellar storytelling by sustaining the plot with lively pacing and rarely leaves a dull moment for most of its 140 minute run time. Yeah, this is longer than you might expect, but the writing is so effective that it has great potential of leaving viewers glued to their seats. This film gets quite dark, unsettling, and at times a bit uncomfortable to watch as it explores themes of injustice, police corruption, juvenile deliquincy, and trouble fatherhood; and this is all done by the deeply suspenseful atmosphere. The story takes many (sometimes violent) twists and turns from start to finish, and nearly every scene is unpredictable. The cast demonstrated some enticing performances. Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper were great, but the performance I was most impressive with was Dane Dehaan who plays Ryan Gosling's character son as a teenager who develops a ill-advised bond with the son of Bradley Cooper's character. Ray Liotta also makes an appearance as a corrupt cop Peter DeLuca who secretly gets involved with a cocaine deal.The Place Beyond the Pines packs an effective punch and is quite compelling from start until its final stretch. The acting is fantastic the script is highly ambitious, and the cinematography is something of Oscar-worthy. This film, however, is not recommended for anyone sensitive to intense subject matter because the film is quite brooding at some parts, but it is very well-crafted movie.",The Place Beyond the Pines
82,punishmentpark,Thoroughly disappointed.,3,3 May 2019,"I have started watching this movie twice before, but turned it off after some five minutes each time, because I couldn't relate to the character of Luke somehow. Yesterday I got the blu-ray in the mail and was determined to finish it, as I was still curious for the whole story. In short, I was thoroughly disappointed. Even though there were plenty of enjoyable bits and aspects and it is always a pleasure to watch Eva Mendes, there is just too much wrong with 'The place beyond the pines'.First off, I didn't care much for killing off Luke and then going with the struggling 'heroic' cop Avery and his troubles with his colleagues and later on the shenanigans of their sons became simply boring. And why would Romina look Luke up if she has no intention of getting back with him, let alone tell him she's had his baby? And there's more that just annoyed me plot-wise, but I'll leave it at that. There are also plenty of very hard to believe things in here, such as the 'brilliant' plan of placing a big white truck near a busy road and close to a house as a means of escape...And then there's the acting. I'm not a particular fan of Cooper or Gosling, but that often depends on their roles. In 'Drive' or 'All good things' Gosling does very well, I think, but the way he goes rampant during the robberies is way over the top for my taste, and all in all, I'm not very charmed with this character Luke - it seemed very out of place that he hit Kofi, for instance,... I haven't seen Cooper in many films, but in a simple comedy like 'The hangover' he does well enough. I wouldn't have cast him for this role, but I think his part was not very interesting in the first place - which goes for a lot of characters.That leaves some really nice scenes with the bike(s), the ever enchanting Eva Mendes, a pretty nice soundtrack (although it is a little much at times) and... what else? 'The place...' felt a bit like a really long episode of 'Twin peaks' without the weirdness, with that motorcycle guy, what's-his-name - but certainly not as good or interesting.I'm sure I will give it another try sometime and maybe I can discover some more upsides to it (or downsides...), but for now I can't give more than three stars out of ten.",The Place Beyond the Pines
83,Troy_Campbell,Ambitious and flawed,7,14 May 2013,"A father-son drama from the audacious filmmaker of Blue Valentine, TPBTP is daring, hard- hitting and, in patches, brilliant (not least the one continuous shot to kickstart the proceedings). Two of the hottest properties working in Tinseltown today, Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper are on top of their game here; the former as a dropkick stunt bike rider who opts to rob banks when he learns he has a son who needs providing for, the latter a rookie cop dealing with tremendous guilt over a fatal mistake that has him hailed a hero. Neither actor lets go of the opportunity the meaty scripts affords their characters and they deliver deeply intense turns. It's a shame then, that there are also serious misgivings which stop this motion picture from really soaring. Most notably, the third act - set 15 years after the events of the first two acts, and focussing on Jason and AJ, the 17 year old sons of Gosling and Cooper respectively - is hard to invest in due to the frankly unbelievable character arc of Jason (Dane DeHaan) and the downright woeful miscasting of Emory Cohen as AJ.

In spite of its being a little overlong it has a strong rawness and two excellent acting performances. Ryan Gosling and Bradle Cooper are a perfect pair of opposites: Gosling is all wildness whereas Cooper wonderfully plays a man who rehearsed for life and seems uncomfortable with praise. The film's first two-thirds, focusing on these two men, are fascinating but the story ends up losing a bit its own way in the last half-hour (the coincidence of the grown sons coming across each other is forced).

From the director of Blue Valentine , Derek Cianfrance, The Place Beyond Pines is an engaging crime-drama which has a powerful story-line. The 1st half of the film is completely dominated by mesmerizing performance by Ryan Gosling. The later part of the reel is more into drama when the actual story comes out. Derek Cianfrance does a good job in giving you a different kind of cinema but should have concentrated more on the length and pace of the movie. I felt the movie could have complete in 90 mins then prolonging it for another 45 mins. Screenplay is tight. Editing could have been better. Cinematography is excellent. Dialogues are nice. Ryan Gosling steals the show. The actor , as usual , is expressive. he emotes superbly through his eye that it is pleasure to watch him every time he appears on the screen. Cooper impresses equally as honest cop and gives a snarling performance. Eva Mendes was good. The actor who played the role Jason's son was nice.Overall , if you are big fan of Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper, the film is a treat for you. Good 3/5",The Place Beyond the Pines
87,napierslogs,A story of trashy criminals and dirty cops evolving into one about fathers and sons and life,8,14 April 2013,"What he have here is a story about fathers and their sons. In fact, three separate stories - each one leads into the next. A lesser movie would have just told one story, but ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is larger in scope and needs all three parts to tell the complete story. A life is not just about your life but those you affect and those you leave behind for years to come.The first father is Luke (Ryan Gosling) who didn't know he had a son until a girl whose name he happens to remember shows up with a one year- old son. Prior to that moment he was a daredevil with no ambitions, no money, and no care for his life. Now he's a father. A father with no money nor job. Wearing a dirty, inside-out, torn t-shirt and tattoos covering his arms, neck and face, he is the epitome of trash. But you know, the quiet, reserved, soulful, good-looking trash. And now that he's a father, he's going to care for his son however he can. He hooks up with his partner in crime, literally - Robin (Ben Mendelsohn). Together they are like a Hall & Oates version of Bonnie and Clyde.In Schenectady, New York - the place beyond the pines - the only thing dirtier than the trashy criminals are the cops themselves. And then the second father is introduced. The character of Avery (Bradley Cooper) is carefully crafted into what should be the greatest human being on planet Earth. And he's a cop. And he's a father. And he's a son to a father who might have been but probably wasn't the greatest human being on planet Earth.The film went for editing and filming styles to echo the characters' situations and actions. You can guess what that would look like when Gosling is racing through the forest on his motorcycle. But as we approach the more expansive ending, there are some beautiful shots of the trees lining Schenectady's countryside roads. That works particularly well with Cooper giving a remarkable performance of Avery constantly coming to grips with his life.The final act tells a story very different from, but completely connected to, the two that came before it. It could have been tightened up a bit, but ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" isn't telling a quick story. It's telling the story of multiple lives, of death, family, love, honour and obedience. Employing overall themes of revenge, ambition, and what it means to be a father, and a son. I say it succeeds in its larger scope, even if it doesn't just tell a story the way one would want it to.",The Place Beyond the Pines
88,Jeremy_Urquhart,A review from 2013 I just dug up,8,23 April 2020,"I'm gonna come out and admit right now that this review is not going to be particularly long, nor is it going to be very in-depth. This is one of those movies where you really want to go into it without knowing too much about it at all (technically every movie you should enter into with as few expectations as possible, but this one to perhaps a greater extent). Still, I'll cover as much as I can without really going into the plot, because:
1. That'll be better for you if you haven't seen the film yet.
And
2. I think it's kinda boring when reviews spend a paragraph or two just regurgitating a plot synopsis- people who are yet to see the film don't want to read about what to expect, and people reading the review who have seen the film already know what they're being told.I will go so far as to say that this is a definite three-act film, and it involves a number of different characters whose lives all cross and intertwine throughout the film, often in thrilling and surprising way. It reminded me quite a bit of the very good Mexican drama from 2000 ""Amores Perros,"" which was another three-act film, this time about a car crash that had dramatic impacts on three different sets of characters. The links between the characters in The Place Beyond the Pines aren't as obvious, but still just as compelling and interesting.Judging each act by itself, I'd probably have to say that the opening act is the strongest. It's probably the most thrilling of the bunch, and features some absolutely stunning car chases that are awe-inspiring yet also somewhat simple. It's the fastest paced of all the acts, and is very effective at pulling you into the film with its moments of action and riveting suspense. Act Two slows things down a bit, focusing more on a quieter story-line, and extensive character development for the character who is probably the closest one to the film's ""central character."" Act Three jarringly begins with a title reading ""15 Years Later,"" but picks things up a bit after the slightly drawn out second act. It brings the first two acts together in a neat yet unexpected fashion, and while not as action-packed as the first, is definitely just as suspenseful and dramatic.The acting in this movie's great, with Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper probably standing out the most. Ryan Gosling is playing a character here that's quite similar to his one in Drive, but he really can play this sort of brooding, reserved, and occasionally brutally violent character very well. He has a certain presence on screen in this movie that's hard to explain, and while some people may complain that he's starting to become typecast, and some may be tired of the general lack of emotions in his characters, I think he's doing what he's doing really well, and this role continues to assist the notion that he's one of the best actors currently working. And Bradley Cooper gives a damn good performance too- who knew that ""that guy from The Hangover"" could be such a good actor? This and Silver Linings Playbook prove that he is perhaps one of the best actors currently working too. Lot of supporting actors and actresses in this too, all of whom are really good. It's overall just a really good film to see if you wanna experience some great performances, and the fact that there are a number of different characters focused on at different times allows a large cast of people to all have their individual moments to shine. No one feels under-used, and pretty much everyone has a suitable amount of screen time. It's nice to see a big cast like this one all commit to a film too.This movie is also great technically too. The film's music is suitably haunting and ominous, and never really felt overdone or anything. Cianfrance's direction is fantastic too. He injects a lot of style into this movie, and this movie is constantly a visual joy to look at. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what makes the direction (and cinematography) in this movie so unique and compelling, so all I can really say is that it is. You kind of know you're in for a stylish and unique looking movie after the stunning three minute long opening shot of this film, which right off the bat tells you that this movie is going to be something a bit out of the ordinary.I do still think this movie is quite accessible, despite it being quite long, and fairly slow-moving in parts. It has two of the most popular actors working today (who are also likely to draw in a fairly prominent female crowd), and some really great performances, writing, and direction, which almost anyone can appreciate to some extent.It probably is, in all honesty though, a film that movie buffs and cinephiles will like the most. They'll likely go crazy over the inventive cinematography and stylish direction. If you can watch and appreciate a stylish, hypnotic film like Drive, then I'd say The Place Beyond the Pines is right up your alley. This doesn't exactly feel like Drive, mind you- it's less violent, has more dialogue, and probably just has a bit more going on in general, but both movies look about as good as each other.So, I think you should definitely check this movie out- you may not love it, but I think you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who either didn't at least appreciate it to some extent, or didn't like at least one of the film's three acts. It's not a perfect film, but it is a really, really good one. Almost definitely the best movie I've seen so far this year. Then again, is that saying much? I haven't seen many movies at the movies this year- Side Effects and Oblivion were good, but not amazing. Iron Man 3 was a disappointment, and Movie 43 made Scary Movie feel like The Naked Gun. The Intouchables was really good, but technically that's a 2011 movie, so yeah... I've heard Star Trek Into Darkness is really good though. I may see it eventually, but I'm pretty much a Star Trek virgin- haven't seen any of the TV shows or movies, so I'm not dying to see it or anything. I may write a review eventually, but don't count on it. Instead, you should go see The Place Beyond the Pines. It's a good move; very good indeed.",The Place Beyond the Pines
89,areatw,Tense thriller that turnes into an intriguing drama,8,9 April 2020,"'The Place Beyond the Pines' is a strong addition to the crime genre - a compelling and unpredictable film that evolves from an action/thriller into a very effective and moving drama.Unlike most crime/thrillers of the modern day, 'The Place Beyond the Pines' places a lot more more emphasis on character development and depth of story, which was unexpected but definitely welcome. We get to know the characters and their backstories in the first half of the film which makes it easier to connect emotionally in the second 'drama' half.Personally I'd have preferred a bit more action and perhaps a shorter conclusion as the film does drag towards the end. Gosling's character, who provides all of the action in the film, is killed off too early for me and the slow pacing in the second half doesn't help. These are minor issues though and 'The Place Beyond the Pines' is a very good film overall.",The Place Beyond the Pines
90,MadamWarden,BEYOND MY PATIENCE,5,20 September 2021,"Honestly, the first half of the movie was ok but once the 15 years later part was unnecessary, painful and in the end really disappointing. If there was a message here I obviously didn't get it.Cooper and Gosling were solid as were Mendez and Mendelson. Their characters and stories relatable and interesting.The two sons were irritating, irrelevant and ultimately meaningless. De Haan's character incongruous. Why did he only ask about his father now? Why suddenly so obsessed he destroys own family? And his complete lack of respect, love for his parents. His willingness to rob a pharmacy for an obnoxious kid he has only just meet and already gotten into trouble over. Beyond logic.As for Cohen. A pouty, nasty little kid. I guess a fair enough outcome of a broken home and career father, but no depth or reason. In fact the character development in this loooooong pointless story is non-existent. A pretentious bit of claptrap really.An ok movie if you have a few hours to spare but don't expect much.",The Place Beyond the Pines
91,maurice_yacowar,Solitude of fathers visited upon their sons,7,23 April 2013,"Derek Cianfrance's epic strikes an old-fashioned romantic note about how one's character is shaped by DNA and destiny. The three-part structure is classic form. The Thesis is the wild, egotistic life of the daredevil motorcyclist, Luke (Ryan Gosling). The Antithesis is the supposedly hero cop, Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper), In the Synthesis the two men's sons clash. Cianfrance clearly prefers the jerk Luke over the responsible citizen Avery, so Jason kicks over the traces of the stable, loving life his mother and his adoptive father gave him and chooses to live out his father's dashing folly. Perhaps the film's key symbol is Luke's circus act. He and two other cyclists are locked in a huge open steel mesh ball in which they speed up and around the sides narrowly avoiding collision. In that artificial, closed world Luke is triumphant. But in the outside real world the speeding trips intersect and the lives collide and crash. Outside the ball he goes too far, ruining his hopes to win back Romina, trying one bank job too many, dying in a bathetic fall from a window.

92,aciessi,The Long and Winding Road,9,1 January 2018,"Sometimes, you never know what the actions of now will create for the future. The Place Beyond the Pines is an incredible film in that it's story goes in one direction and then swerves into another, only to come back around at the end. Not unlike a motorcycle ride. I was thrown for a loop, in the best kind of way. We follow Ryan Gosling's character, a criminal carny performer desperate to provide for his newborn child by robbing banks. He is stopped in his tracks by Bradley Cooper. Cooper kills him, but the guilt he is left with him nearly gets him in the end. He lives with the grief of leaving a little boy fatherless in comparison to his own son, who will never know that his father is a murderer. What happens then is even more interesting. The two sons, a generation apart, form a bond with drugs and alcohol, and both end up repeating the sins of their fathers. One becomes a thug, especially when he realizes that his best friend's father killed his dad all those years ago.What started out for me as shaky territory (love story between Gosling and Mendes) turns into something of a masterpiece that most film lovers overlooked five years ago. A truly captivating drama, with real, raw performances from everyone involved and an intriguing way to tell a tragic story.",The Place Beyond the Pines
93,cultfilmfan,The Place Beyond the Pines,10,29 April 2013,"I was eagerly awaiting The Place Beyond the Pines, after being very impressed with director and co-writer Derek Cianfrance's previous film Blue Valentine. Here he again teams up with actor Ryan Gosling, and makes another great film. Much like Blue Valentine, The Place Beyond the Pines is a very emotionally intense film. It gives you a certain feeling of uneasiness and a lump in your throat while you are watching it, but again like in both films they deal with thematic material that feels so realistic and gritty, that it often hits home in several ways and even if you can't relate personally, you still really feel for the characters that you are watching. This is a film where I really respected the honesty of it's writers in portraying characters that feel real and are in many ways flawed and human. There are certainly good things about the characters we have on display here, but they are in a sense antiheros because we see how they strive to go on ahead with their lives and with their ambitions and dreams of something better, but often the choices they make along the way are not for the best and how they go about achieving said dreams often ends up with regrets, or other related problems. The film had a certain grittiness and realistic feel to how the character's talked, looked and how they lived. It certainly felt like a slice of life film as in what you are watching could easily be a documentary, or a news special because of how tragic and at the same type how often in a sense things like these actually go on. In writing about the story for this film, I really do not want to say that much because it wouldn't be fair to the film, or to you the reader. All, I can say is that everything does seem to connect in one way, or another and in a rather creative and well thought out way. The film's screenplay really impressed me because of how we get into the minds and feelings of these people on display here and at times we cheer for them and other times we are repulsed and wish that they had done different things, but that is one of the strong points of the film because we actually can empathize and relate with these characters. We may not always like them, or what they do, but at the same time we can not take our eyes off of them and we feel a certain concern, or over protectiveness towards them. Like, I mentioned earlier, the film is quite intense and at times somewhat difficult to watch, but ultimately the film is a really rewarding experience. It's a heavy film that leaves a lot of food for thought, but while everything is going on we are so engrossed and captivated by what is going on that it feels like some of the best fiction we have ever seen, or read. It plays out like a great screenplay, or play whereas everything comes together somehow, even if we did not see it coming and by the end it all seems to click and make sense and when you view the film more than once like I did, everything just seems to flow beautifully from a writing and directing perspective and stance. The acting here is all very impressive as well, from the major stars and main characters to some of the lesser known supporting characters and actors. Everyone is so believable and deliver powerful and real performances. I have overheard that a lot of people were interested in seeing this film because of Ryan Gosling. The reasons for this are more than just his good looks, although I am sure that is why a lot of females have gone to the film. He has proved himself at a young age to be a very capable and talented actor. I have enjoyed the majority of the films he has been in as well as his performances in them and he continues to improve with his technique and choice of films. Bradley Cooper, whose dramatic performance in Silver Linings Playbook (one of my three favourite films of last year) continues to impress here as well and I hope he continues to take on more serious and dramatic roles now that The Hangover series is completed this year. The film's haunting yet beautiful musical score often enhances the mood and feeling for the film and is quite a powerful tool in this story that is put to good effect. Here we have a film that has everything going for it. I don't have a single complaint about it and I continue to admire the ambition, thought and work that went into it. So far 2013 has proved to be a very impressive year with Ginger & Rosa, Spring Breakers and now The Place Beyond the Pines. I continue to look forward to more films by Cianfrance, because he is emerging as quite a talented writer/director and I look anxiously to his next great piece of achievement after the very impressive Blue Valentine and now The Place Beyond the Pines. One of the year's best films so far.",The Place Beyond the Pines
94,Quietb-1,Three bad movies in one.,2,16 April 2013,"Hey. Any well written movie doesn't start dialogue scenes with the word ""hey"". This one does it at least five times early. Add a loud and distracting music score combined with in their face cinematography and you are creating a hard to like movie.If you don't like the Ryan Gosling story don't worry it doesn't last too long. It's just long enough to dislike the character. You'll notice when he is recognizable on the motorcycle he goes about ten miles per hour. The helmeted stunt man makes the fast rides. The Bradley Cooper segment begins with a cop not waiting for backup as he charges, at the need of the writer, into the house to confront Ryan Gosling making an exposition phone call. Bring on Ray Liotta, he is so type cast, he comes on screen screaming dirty cop. Now we have a talky dirty cop movie. The third segment takes place fifteen years later where son of Gosling gets together with, how did he turn out that way, son of Cooper. Nothing you haven't seen before including the drug drinking party.You would think something would happen in the woods? Liotta gets a gun armed Cooper to follow him into the woods only to put the car in reverse and drive out. Son of Gosling forces Cooper into the woods and instead of asking for the car keys asks for his wallet as the writer had to show an old folded picture, a stretch.Combine boring dialogue with unlikeable characters in too long of a movie and the audience doesn't sit through the credits. The movie makes the mistake to references ""Goonies"" and ""Star Wars"", you wish you could change the channel to either of these far better movies.Don't waste your time or money.

Beautifully shot, a superb cast and an often quite captivating story. However, I still don't quite know what the whole point of it is? It is long but doesn't have the breadth and depth of an epic. It is intense but not particularly moving. It is grandiose but lacks profundity. It often feels like I am the only person on this planet who isn't just bored to tears by Ryan Gosling's moody sullen characters. He is his usual pouty self here and it is a blessed relief when his act is up. Bradley Cooper is as proficient as ever but there is no deep dive into this character or any of his relationships. An ambitious attempt to create an epic masterpiece but is sorely lacking in originality and depth.",The Place Beyond the Pines

97,bryank-04844,'A Place Beyond the Pines' is a terrific yet tragic film that tries to tell us the effects of constant bad decisions.,7,2 September 2015,"Director Derek Cianfrance is one of the better filmmakers today. Even this being his third feature film, he has consistently shown that he has what it takes to make a powerful and character driven film each time so far. 'The Place Beyond the Pines' is an intense look at the effects of certain actions passed on from father to son over the course of 15 years, and while this story packs a punch, it also fails to be told in the smoothest way as each act of the film is a different time with a different lead that changes direction too suddenly to keep a lucid flow. However, this indie film might garner enough attention and box office success from its cast, which consists of Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper.The film's script is amazing, which was written by Cianfrance, Ben Coccio, and Darius Marder. If you don't know who Ben Coccio, I highly suggest you look him up and seek out a little film he made called 'Zero Day'. However, the script suffers in the mid section a bit when we focus on Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper) who we see as a hard working and great guy who is doing a good job and has a great family. However, as the story goes, he gets off track a bit and becomes this somewhat ignorant character for nor rhyme or reason. But the first hour dealing with Luke (Ryan Gosling) as a motorcycle stunt rider and the last part of the film, which deals with his teenage son does a much better job of staying focused.We first meet Luke in the opening shot of the film as we see a shirtless Gosling bruised and tattooed up. We follow him as he puts on his jacket and helmet, walking through a traveling carnival and getting into a steel ball to ride a motorcycle upside down with other motorists. As the carnival stops in Schenectady, NY, he crosses paths with a past relationship named Romnia (Eva Mendes), who works as a waitress at a shoddy diner and has a new love in her life. But her feelings for Luke haven't left, which leads Luke to find out that she is raising his infant son named Jason.Luke desperately wants to be a part of his boy's life, and not making enough money at the carnival, he takes on a job with an odd mechanic named Robin (Ben Mendelsohn). These two conjure up a plan to make more money by using Luke's motorcycle skills to rob banks as a means to raise money for his kid and develop a decent life. However, news of these bank robbers are hitting the news and new cop Avery Cross (Cooper) crosses paths with Luke during a robbery, which leads to disaster.We then center on Avery Cross and his journey to public office and all the toes and departments he steps on during the way. This is where the story seems to lose a bit of steam as Cooper's character isn't drawn out coherently and seems to not make sense why he does these unorthodox things, which includes going after fellow cops, crooked or not.Then suddenly, the film jumps 15 years into the future without warning as we see Luke's teenage son Jason (Dane DeHaan) and Avery's son AJ (Emory Cohen) meet each other at school and form a bizarre friendship, not knowing who the other one's father is. However, once this is known, things take a turn for the worst as we see similar fates happen to these kids. It comes full circle as we see both kids follow the same mistakes their father's made.Gosling and DeHaan do incredible jobs here as we really feel their pain and struggle for them to do good, but always seem to clumsily screw it up. Bradley Cooper is as always, very charismatic, but his character seems to not flow in an organic way, thus making him not relatable. Eva Mendes' short performance is striking and believable as he gives her all as a confused woman who only wants the best for her son and family. And the cameo of Ray Liotta is decent as he plays the creepy crooked cop to a tee.Cianfrance's camera work is very impressive as he uses a mix between hand-held and steady cams to show us the raw and physical state of his characters struggles. We are really put in the face of the drama and tension with his camera angles. Add to that Mike Patton's eerie and affecting score, which sure drives up the turmoil of this multi-generational piece. 'A Place Beyond the Pines' is a terrific yet tragic film that tries to tell us the effects of constant bad decisions passed down from generation to generation, despite its lumpy and abrupt flow.",The Place Beyond the Pines
98,RonellSowes,Bold Volatile And Fresh But Not Good,4,25 June 2021,"A Place Beyond The Pines seems as if the writer came up with two or three ideas for a movie and being unable to make a full story out of any one he just blended them all into this. It's like an anthology with interweaving stories that follow a common thread which loosely holds them together. And in this picture the combining element for all the segments is Ryan Gosling. Not only because he's a catalyst and driving force behind everything, but also in a less distinct way. His scenes are by far the most intresting and he's able to leave an impact on the movie even when he's not on the screen.This film is one of the most unpredictable I've probably ever seen and definetly stays clear and far away from what might be considered contrived or old. But while it may be disruptive and volatile that doesn't necessarily make it good. It treads over completely fresh ground, but without recognizing that there might be a reason no film has gone this way.Technically the picture may carry on for over an hour more, I'd say it dies with Ryan Gosling's character. That's not to utterly dismiss Bradley Cooper( or Ray Liotta in a fairly small role) who also brings an increased level of intrest to the movie, but everything that comes after just isn't worth telling. A Place Beyond The Pines took a gamble being so bold and I'd have to say it failed.",The Place Beyond the Pines
99,JohnRayPeterson,"A mini saga of sorts and as such, it's quite good.",7,11 June 2013,"This is a three part mini saga rolled into an almost 2½ hour movie. For those who expect the movie to be one that features Ryan Gosling, well it is that only in part, the first part, so when he dies we have a serious pause to deal with before realizing what the movie is about. Only will you get what the flick is actually conveying by the time you see the third part, and the one we could say binds the whole saga together.As storyline goes, it is a demanding one to pull off but Derek Cianfance managed it by writing and directing the film. He had to contend with a substantial cast, but given the experience of most of them, I'm sure that helped a lot. Bradley Cooper had in my opinion the most envious role, given he has the lengthiest part, but I'm estimating.Some might find the lack of hero or good guy to be a shortcoming, but the film just wouldn't have been the same and it wouldn't have been much of a saga had there been one. If you're expecting any kind of Hollywood type tragedy, you'll be happily surprised that it isn't quite like that. I did struggle with the last part of the movie because the two principle protagonists were played by actors who I don't much care for and thus it was a little bit of a letdown, but not enough that I wouldn't recommend the movie.",The Place Beyond the Pines
100,Likes_Ninjas90,Unfolds with little relief,6,5 May 2013,"The unrelenting bleakness and dour nature of The Place Beyond the Pines pitches a question about the difference between empathy and sympathy for troubled characters. Each of the film's conflicted male characters makes poor decisions but only because they are trapped in impossible situations, where action seems necessary. Two out of three of the film's chronological but interlocking chapters uphold this spine of moral ambiguity, only for a clumsy third story to forgo strong repercussions so that this grim crime saga can resolve itself tidily and with undeserved sentimentality. Two overlapping stories, instead of three linear ones, would have been leaner and more insightful. Ryan Gosling plays Luke, who travels with a fair performing motorbike stunts. When he finds out that he has a child to Romina (Eva Mendes), who is already with someone else now, he quits his job to try to provide for his son. He seeks work from Robin (Ben Mendelsohn), who assists him with robbing banks so that he can make enough money to support his son.In chapter two Bradley Cooper is Avery, a cop married to Jennifer (Rose Byrne) with a son. Avery is wounded shooting someone dead and is falsely declared a hero. To redeem himself, he opts to blackmail a group of crooked cops (one played by Ray Liotta) and move towards politics. The third story sees Luke and Avery's two boys Jason (Dane DeHaan) and AJ (Emory Cohen) growing up together in high school and becoming involved with both theft and drugs. Pines is essentially a Western but with motorcycles instead of horses. Films about the Old West were devoted to the intertwining nature of economics, status and violence. In the days of the Frontier, these were pillars of American history, as people embraced Modernity and Manifest Destiny: controlling their destinies under God and often resorting to violence to achieve and justify the expansion of land and property. One of the finest Westerns to deconstruct the myth of righteous violence was John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962). James Stewart played a lawyer, falsely touted as a hero because people believed he shot a bandit dead, and this lie helped bolster his political career. Pine's second chapter offers uncanny symmetry, reflecting how an inescapable lie and violence leads a man into political falsehood. Like many other Westerns, the film's machismo is totalled through the way violence is used by men to protect or avenge their family bloodlines.The director was Derek Cianfrance, who previously made Blue Valentine with Ryan Gosling, a startlingly intimate film about a corroding marriage. Pines is more of a genre film, posturing as a character study. There are lumps in the script, where characterisation remains extremely thin, existing through action and surface than psychology. Both Gosling and Cooper lack personality in their performances, being left to brood humourlessly, like they have been told to rein in their charisma levels. The film is light on back-story, which makes the initial switch in perspective from Luke to Avery a misstep. At first, it is extremely difficult to sympathise with Cooper's character because he is anonymous to us. His motives gain transparency when we see that he needs a stronger job, his father is a judge who offers him advice, and that his colleagues force him into a point of no return. Yet the moral ambiguity of the characters is tested under the weight of the script's excessive nihilism. The film believably expresses economic pressure through the love and responsibility that men feel for their families. However, the extremity of their actions makes their redemption seem unlikely or outright impossible. One example is after Luke assaults Eva's partner he is freed from gaol on bail, but then decides to commit another robbery. Likewise, Avery decisions are treated as if they are free from choice. Unlike James Stewart's character, he chooses to thrive off a lie and the consequences are perfunctory in the end. By the third story, in a movie that is two hours and twenty minutes long, I had grown weary of the film's heavy-handedness. The shootings, the beatings, drug taking, theft, and multiple robberies, began to seem artificial, employed solely to inflate the grittiness and self- importance. The credibility of the plotting is also stretched by how contrived the third chapter is, relying on the enormity of the coincidence that both Jason and AJ would come to know each on a personal level. The grimness of this chapter unfolds with little relief, again reflecting a movie where your engagement will depend on whether you believe the characters are tragically circumstantial or if their pain is self-inflicted.",The Place Beyond the Pines
101,Christian_Dimartino,I am starting to enjoy 2013.,9,11 May 2013,"I didn't have much interest in this movie, mainly because ever since I saw Ryan Gosling in Gangster Squad I have not been able to look at him the same again. He was terrible in a bad movie, and he is a terrific actor. But after seeing The Place Beyond the Pines, in which he re-unites with Blue Valentine director Derek Cianfrance, he won me back. He isn't in the movie a lot, but him, and the rest of the cast, shine.Gosling plays Luke, a guy that has realized that a former fling (Eva Mendes) had his baby. In hopes of winning her back, he begins robbing banks, and this event effects the lives of him, her, a cop (Bradley Cooper), and everyone else in their lives. I don't think I really captured the essence of the story very well, but I do not want to ruin anything. TPBTP goes in a direction that the viewer never would have expected, telling three different stories. It tells one tale, then the end of that tale continues onto the next, and so on. It is different, but pretty unique. Chronicle's Dane Dehaan also stars as Luke's son, and he, like the rest of the cast, are marvelous here. Even though I will say that Bradley Cooper's story is sort of weak. In the end, Cianfrance is trying to teach a lesson. I really loved the sort of revenge turn the movie took in the final act. It works, like most of the movie. I do think it is a little long. But I have seen longer, to say the least. But not in a long while have I seen a drama quite as unique as this one.2013 has been a blur so far when it comes to movies. In a year when Terrence Malick delivers a let-down (To the Wonder), I really need something that is going to blow me away. Steven Soderbergh's Side Effects sort of did that, but other than that, the only 9 or 10 movies of 2013 are Iron Man 3, The Great Gatsby, and this one. This is one of the years' best so far.A-",The Place Beyond the Pines

103,Laakbaar,Three movies in one: antihero movie; cop corruption drama; teenage angst movie,8,6 April 2013,"My review has spoilers right from the beginning!This movie is a drama (an epic really) that tells the story of a cop killing a bank robber. The moviegoer is shown not just the incident, but also the life and background of the bank robber, the effect of the shooting on the cop, and how an event such as this echoes down to the next generation. Fate, remorse, ambition, class and fatherhood are themes.In this three-act movie, Act 1 is the story of a daredevil lowlife who attempts to settle down in Schenectady after he discovers he has a son there. But Luke needs money, upsets the family, and turns to crime. In the end he is shot and killed by a police officer after a bank holdup goes bad. This part is an antihero movie (like ""Drive"").Act 2 is the story of what happens to the police officer afterwards. Avery is unsure about the rightness of what he did and is remorseful about killing someone -- but he is treated like a hero, and puts it behind him. After discovering that some of his fellow cops are corrupt, he rats on them and uses that to further his career. This part of the film is a cop corruption drama.Act 3 is set 15 years later. We see that Avery has become a successful DA eyeing political office. Luke's son and Avery's son (both rather troubled young men) end up in the same school and, by chance, become drug buddies. After Jason and AJ get caught, we see that AJ is the true trouble maker. Jason finds out who his real father is and that Avery (AJ's dad) killed him. Will he avenge his father's death? This part of the movie is a teenager angst film.This movie rings true in the sense that every killing must have depth like this that we don't hear about, i.e. a background; an aftermath; a villain who is not quite a villain; a hero who is not a hero; a cast of people sucked into it all by fate and by their own character flaws. In this movie we are privileged to be shown all this.What makes this movie so watchable is mainly the really good story. This is not at all a predictable film. How could it be when it switches genre twice? The superb character development is realistic and nuanced.The acting of everyone in the movie is excellent. There are some amazing performances here by all the main actors. I could comment on each, but it's difficult to single out any single performance. They were all so good.Almost every scene in the movie is imbued with a certain tension. Cianfrance is clearly very skillful at what he does. The events are not explained, but shown to us in clever, subtle and technically proficient ways. When recklessness or menace or delirium is called for, it is duly delivered.The movie is not fast paced at all. (I think those who are expecting mainly a Gosling motorcycle movie may find the pace a little on the slow side after Àct 1.) However, I think this slow pace helped the dramatic tension in the movie.This movie is in no way cliché, despite what a few other reviewers have written. It is shocking to see the protagonist killed halfway through; however, that is essential to what this movie is about. This movie changes directions completely twice. Indeed, a few reviewers have inexplicably rated this movie quite poorly, even giving it a 1/10. Click through to these reviewers' profiles to get a bit of perspective on these low scores. Some reviewers rate movies as 1 or 10, when the right score is always something in between.I think this movie is worth about an 8.5. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",The Place Beyond the Pines

106,SquigglyCrunch,Not At All the Movie I Expected,9,24 October 2016,"The Place Beyond the Pines follows a motorcycle stunt driver who takes up a life of crime in order to provide for his family, while a newbie cop gets involved in some things that aren't exactly legal. I did not expect this movie to be this good, nor did I expect anything in this movie to happen the way it did. And that's one of the many great things about this movie, the plot is so unpredictable, and it takes so many twists and turns and it's just kind of awesome to watch. The way the plot progresses allows for a lot of meaning to shine through that I won't spoil, but trust me, this movie says some things are just kind of cool without being overly pretentious. Because of previous events and the way the movie has focused on certain characters, some scenes become much more effective than they may have been on their own, and because of how unconventional and unique the movie is it leaves the audience on edge and completely unsure as to what will actually happen. The acting is pretty great for the most part. My only complaint would be Ryan Gosling at the beginning of the movie, but by that I mean the first maybe ten minutes of this 140 minute movie. And even then, it's just the handful of lines of dialogue he has that aren't great, his physical acting is though. After that point everyone is pretty fantastic. The characters themselves are well-written and realistic. I bought each character as a more or less real person. There were a couple scenes where I thought one of the characters might be a little too stupid to make sense, but considering the circumstances they were in during these scenes it becomes something I'm willing to overlook. The movie features multiple lengthy shots, and they often include a lot of stuntwork, potentially from the actors themselves. It's really quite impressive that these long takes happened. The very first scene is a long take, and it's pretty fantastic. It lasts for multiple minutes, and to my knowledge includes Ryan Gosling doing his own stuntwork, in the way of biking fairly dangerously. I don't know if he was quickly switched out or if he did it himself, but kudos to them for whichever they managed to pull off. Not only that, but the shots themselves are great. They're immersive and placed in exactly the right place to give the audience an idea even of how the characters are feeling or what they're thinking. The soundtrack compliments the movie really well, and it's just a good soundtrack on it's own. It's definitely one that I'll be listening to in the future. Right down to the title, the movie excels. After seeing the movie and paying attention to some of the setting choices I found some really clever symbolism directed at the title scattered throughout the movie. It's one of the those little things that prove how much effort is put in to the movie. If I have but one flaw with the movie it's the last act. It isn't necessarily weak, but it's different and maybe a little too out-of- place at first. It picks up and becomes much better as it progresses, but it's dips ever-so-slightly at the transition and there is one part of it that I couldn't figure out how it happened. Overall The Place Beyond the Pines is fantastic. Everything about the movie is both entertaining and very skillfully made. While I would love to call the movie flawless, it isn't quite 10/10 material in my eyes. There's not a particular reason, because even the slight dip as it transitions into the third act is hardly something to complain about. It isn't a movie that I finished and felt blown away by, but it's pretty amazing regardless. Who knows, maybe on my second watch I'll bump it up. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.",The Place Beyond the Pines
107,cinematic_aficionado,an unfulfilled experience,6,29 April 2013,"It was erroneous of me to expect a film experience similar to ""Drive"" and the experience was very mixed.On the one hand, I cannot deny the effectiveness and depth of the storyline - robber who wants to provide for a lover with his child and the altercation with some corrupt police officers - especially when it was made one run through generations and how by killing off the main character soon in the film proved a risk worth taking.Despite the promise, this project did not bring home the exhilaration one has come to expect from the great crime movies. It felt as we saw the end titles in anticipation mode and asked ourselves ""was that it?""Much as Gosling carried the film with great skill, Cooper was just swimming out of his waters; just because he got noticed for utilising his good looking boy persona in the ""silver linings"" does not make him a good choice for a crime/drama film.Concluding, I would call this a film of promise but not of fulfilment.",The Place Beyond the Pines
108,billygoat1071,Beyond The Surfaces,8,29 June 2013,"The Place Beyond The Pines is a movie that tells three interconnected lives of people being burdened by the mistakes they make then leads to its unpredictable result. The whole concept is probably built for an exceptional cinematic family drama. It's all magnetic at first, then it suddenly settles for being littler when it proceeds to the rest of the plot. But the film's strong ambition made these little stories entirely grand and totally engrossing. The performances and craft elevates everything in the film. The Place Beyond The Pines isn't the most balanced sometimes but it succeeds of being a splendid experience.The plot seems to present the irony of these lives. There's one who's breaking the law for the benefit of his family, and the other serves the law and becomes a hero, but isn't happy and regrets about his pride. Their upcoming fate and legacy depend on their motivation and pathos. It eventually becomes unpredictable, and those twists revelations are the best feat of the drama. While the film is able to comprehend the themes beneath, the fascination of the next two acts slows down, but thanks to the extreme style, it's still gripping to watch.The performances are amazing as expected. Ryan Gosling is always brilliant. The film mostly treats him as a legend but that's what he really needs here. The best thing in Gosling is no matter how much he tries to be cool, there is still humanity manifesting inside of his characters. Same about Bradley Cooper which you can feel his character's burden. The rest are also great in their little roles.Finally, the other outstanding achievement is the filmmaking. Derek Cianfrance's direction brings an astonishing cinematic style to the picture. He consistently gives enough air to breathe at the emotional parts and thrills to excite at the action. The camera-work brings sorts of marvelous angles and each shot are just magnificent to look at. The storytelling also shows a clever way of entering one act to another, as introducing the central character of each segment.It's easy to love the craft in The Place Beyond The Pines although the energy doesn't come off too even. Still, it's engrossing and compelling like what anybody wishes it to be. The whole film did feels like a genuine lifetime journey, exploring these people's actions and consequences. It's not that perfect, but then you'll get to see some great performances and stunning filmmaking. The ambition already makes the film remarkable, and whatever you might complain about it won't even matter that much.",The Place Beyond the Pines
109,rubenm,Full of atmosphere and an ill-fated feeling,8,7 April 2013,"The opening sequence of 'The Place Beyond the Pines' is marvelous. We see Ryan Gosling playing with a knife, then opening a door and walking through a funfair, filmed from behind. While the brightly coloured attractions light up in the dusk, we follow him to a tent where the audience is already cheering and applauding. He climbs a motorbike and rides into a steel cage to perform stunts. All this is one, four minute take. What follows, could be straight from a Raymond Carver short story. In short pieces of dialogue, we learn that Gosling once had a one night stand with a local girl, resulting in a child he doesn't know about. Seeing an opportunity to create the family he himself never had, he quits the traveling funfair and tries to settle in the small town to be close to his son. This is the beginning of a series of dramatic events, that years later will lead to his son becoming a desperate outlaw. The special thing about this film is that it consists of three separate parts with three different lead actors: a crime thriller, a cop story and a teenage drama. The structure is very clever and in the end it all comes together. There is a central father/son-theme that is worked out very well throughout the movie. Director Derek Cianfrance clearly doesn't go for the easy way and is not afraid to take risks, but he pulls it off perfectly. The plot develops very smoothly, and never feels unnatural. The acting is very good, with Ryan Gosling standing out as the cool biker, torn between the responsibility he feels for his son and the aimless way he leads his life. With a runtime of 140 minutes, it's a long film, but the three stories are interesting enough to keep the attention of the audience. This is an impressive film, full of atmosphere and an ill- fated feeling. I'm already looking forward to the next Cianfrance movie.",The Place Beyond the Pines
110,christophe92300,Big disappointment,5,7 April 2013,"Blue Valentine wasn't exceptional, but it showed Derek Cianfrance had potential, whereas The Place Beyond The Pines completely ruins all hopes founded on the director-writer.The most difficult thing to understand is the structure of the movie itself: the script is divided into 3 subparts that fit badly together. The point of this approach is far from being obvious and gives the impression that Cianfrance lacked inspiration and assembled 3 short films.The story itself is distressingly banal, alternating between superficiality and cheap psychology. The script is conventional, predictable, and everything unfolds linearly, with no rhythm to say the least. The movie feels endless, especially once you reach the almost risible last act.The cast, to his credit, tries to keep afloat in this ocean of mediocrity but makes no miracle. Gosling, in the same register than in Drive, is a bit irritating, but what about Bradley Cooper, one of the best actors of his generation, who is completely transparent because of his bland and uninteresting character.Fortunately, the cinematography is polished because without that, the movie would be a bitter failure. Cianfrance should stick to his work behind the camera, give up writing and hire better scenarists.",The Place Beyond the Pines
111,TheSquiss,"Lives crash, mistakes compound. Choice or destiny?",8,1 May 2013,"The Place Beyond the Pines is a courageous film, or rather, it makes courageous plays as it segues from one principal character to another or replicates situations previously seen but with a new tint and a bitterer aftertaste.Writer/director Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine – also with Ryan Gosling) has sculpted a remarkable film that isn't always easy to watch, leaves the viewer with questions and various possible interpretations but thrills and moves us in equal measure. As Robert Rodriguez did with From Dusk Till Dawn, Cianfrance settles us into a journey, only to change direction with his tone and character focus. It may not be as spectacular a diversion as Rodriguez' bloodfest, but it has far greater reality and hits us far harder than the vampire flick. Cianfrance is known largely for documentaries but he handles the drama masterfully and perhaps his experience with factual stories is why The Place Beyond the Pines feels so true.Stunt motorcyclist, Luke (Gosling), arrives back in Schenectady, New York with a traveling carnival and sees Romina (Eva Mendes), with whom he had a brief fling the previous year. But for her appearance, life would have continued rolling along for all concerned. Or maybe the Sliding Doors moment is when her mother answers the door to Luke with a baby in her arms and reveals it is his. Or maybe it's when Perhaps there is just a sad inevitability caused by the weaknesses and personalities of all the lives that collide.Luke opts to stay to be a father to the baby, despite Romina having a partner, Kofi (Mahershalla Ali), and slides into bank robbery to supplement his meagre income, but it's a decision that impacts many lives.The Place Beyond the Pines is packed with a superb cast and is a rare film that can genuinely boast two leading men (not just a support elevated because of his ego or box office expectations), the second being Bradley Cooper as Avery, a cop thrown into the maelstrom simply by being in the right place at the right time. Both Gosling and Cooper draw us into the lives of their characters with conviction. On the face of it Luke and Avery are opposites, crook and cop, but neither is exempt from making terrible mistakes and neither is without redeeming qualities. Though, ultimately, they may have differing motives, their intent is remarkably close and their characters not so far apart. At different stages, the two men try to give Romina money and the scene is almost identical in dialogue, manner and result. Only their intentions contrast, but even then not wildly.Gosling has boosted his credibility with the likes of Lars and the Real Girl, Drive and Gangster Squad stretching beyond the pretty boy roles to the meatier, grittier parts that chill, excite and rip your balls off if you step too close, expanding his range fantastically in the process. Likewise, Cooper has come a long way from his easy on the eye roles (TV's Alias, The Hangover etc.) to surprise many people with last year's Oscar nominated turn in Silver Linings Playbook and, though he lacks the range and presence of Gosling, he's far from being just a simple matinée idol. In this, equally, they cause us to reflect on our own mistakes and choices and, again equally, they engage our emotions as we watch their own inner turmoil.Throughout The Place Beyond the Pines there are characters we despise, characters we pity and some we care about on various levels but there isn't a single character upon the screen that doesn't have some considerable effect on us, positive or negative. They are too real, too brutal, too damaged or too lost to be flippantly ignored.Luke and Avery's sons, fifteen years on from the major turning point, likewise share remarkably similar fortunes despite strikingly different backgrounds. Again, a Sliding Doors moment throws them together and the collision sets in motion another journey of clash and discovery as they wrestle with an unfortunate legacy their fathers have created for them.In the midst of these four warring males, Romina and Kofi are comparative innocents struggling to do right and survive the anger, viciousness and worldly corruption that hammers around them. Mendes performance as exciting and heart-wrenching as a young woman who's life is turned on its head but who tries so determinedly to be a good mother to a wayward son. There is a wonderful moment when Kofi and his adopted son sit together outside the ice-cream parlour where his natural father, Luke, gave him his first taste of ice-cream. The boy rails against the world and his mother and, somehow, in spite of all the flack he's been forced to endure, Kofi reacts with love and humour. It's a touching moment and yet another parallel between the lives of both men and sons, past and present.What is The Place Beyond the Pines about?

112,RevRonster,I think I found my favorite drama I've watched in 2013,9,14 August 2013,"While ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" may sound like the name of a steak house in the middle of the Pacific Northwest, the film proves to be one of the most emotionally powerful and dramatic films I've watched in awhile and may be the best drama I've seen in 2013.The story is just drenched in human turmoil and emotion and was a little different that what I expected when I sat down to watch it but was more than pleasantly surprised with how engaging and enthralling it was. Not to mention the film is presented in a terrific, gritty way that made the film feel real and authentic.Finally, the performances are just incredible in it. Gosling and Cooper were two actors that were pretty much expected to deliver with their characters (and they did...and better than they usually do--and they usually do great!) but I was surprised how great Eva Mendes was and, more so, how amazing Dane DeHaan was.Overall, the movie is just a prime example of how great a drama can be!",The Place Beyond the Pines
113,davidgee,Three for the price of one!,8,6 May 2013,"The writers have pared down the material for three movies, so this 'portmanteau' version is tight and crisp. Eva Mendes and Bradley Cooper are very solid in their lead roles. Ryan Gosling is growing into a George Clooney kind of charisma; his only problem is a ""postural"" one: he stands very stiffly and doesn't seem to know what to do with his arms (a lot of actors suffer from this: Montgomery Clift and - especially - Elvis Presley spring instantly to mind). There are some reliable faces in the police department: Ray Liotta, Bruce Greenwood. Rose Byrne is very persuasive (despite being a bit short-changed by the writers) as Cooper's wife, who wonders what kind of man she's married. Of the two teenagers Dane DeHaan shows the most promise - I was reminded of a young Heath Ledger.Family themes with a crime drama undercurrent: THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES is well scripted, sensitively played and crisply directed. Better by far than any of the current crop of flabby blockbusters, this is one of the best movies so far this year.",The Place Beyond the Pines
114,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Neo Noir Collective,6,6 May 2013,"A tale of three stories, all connected to a flawed but kindhearted stunt riding motorcycle guy. With tattoos covering most of his body and a Metallica T-shirt, the opening shot of Ryan Gosling's Luke (a cross between Steve McQueen and Peter Stormare) strutting through a carnival crowd and stepping into a circular cage where three motorcycles zip around like killer bees promises a lot more than THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES offers, but that's only if you're expecting an action movie to begin with.The first vignette has Luke discovering he has a baby with his ex, which gets to him deep down. And in the Film Noir fashion our flawed antihero goes straight into crime, robbing banks along with a grizzly getaway driver. The bank robbing scenes, followed by Luke zipping off on his motorbike, are quick and shaky but always involving. Gosling turns in a worthy old-school performance as a desperate tough cookie, blending slow burn venom with quiet pathos. But his story doesn't last longAfter one robbery too many, Luke is chased into a suburban house and let's just say the story's now handed off to Bradley Cooper who, as Avery, takes the second tier of a good cop in a sea of sharks. The versatile SILVER LININGS Oscar nominee does a pretty good job as a vulnerable pawn yet this story lacks the punch of the first one. The best scenes have Avery under the gun of his impending foes, but there's not much payoff to the edgy buildup. The third tale has been maligned by critics and audiences alike: Cutting 15 years later we follow the sons of both Luke and Avery. Luke's kid is a shy brooding stoner while Avery's, speaking like a hip-hop wannabe, pushes him into criminal activity: just to make a party better. Not a bad little ride here, but the troubled teens are paper-thin and it doesn't seem a worthy crescendo for those initial characters that made these punk's existence, and the overall story, happen in the first place.Judging as a whole, THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES is a decent patchwork that, during the last fifteen minutes, pays homage to a bonafide classic MILLERS CROSSING as two important characters meet up at the rural location the film's named after: a do or die moment resulting in a somewhat bland conclusion.",The Place Beyond the Pines
115,ClaytonDavis,"Gosling, Cooper, Cohen, and DeHaan ALL shine...",8,6 August 2013,"Utterly compelling with a magic wand of storytelling from writer/director Derek Cianfrance along with co-writers Ben Coccio and Darius Marber, The Place Beyond the Pines is one of the more natural and stylistic endeavors of 2013. Beautifully constructed and captured by DP Sean Bobbitt and orchestrated superbly by Mike Patton, the film has all the necessary qualities to become a future classic.Deeply affecting when it needs, the film's first two-thirds hold the viewer on for an emotional roller coaster through the lives of our characters. Academy Award Nominees Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper attack their roles with aggression and fury. I haven't seen Gosling wear a character this comfortably since Lars and the Real Girl (2007). He sticks his landing time and time again throughout his time on-screen. As Luke, he stimulates the raw intake of fear, despair, and regret in a manner almost reminiscent of James Dean. Another proof of his abilities to exercise his talents expertly.Cooper on the other hand has truly transformed himself from the popcorn- shtick of The Hangover (2009) into a genuine and emotionally driven performer that will continue to surprise audiences for years to come. He's layered with feelings that continue to present themselves and mutate into a new level of execution. He forms 'Avery' from a cloth of prestigious and impressive turns by actors playing cops. In the same vein that made Ethan Hawke so brilliant in Training Day (2001), Cooper allows the audience to sit alongside him not only in his day-to-day job, but also in the corruption that goes with it. He smooths out the inner essence of family, both immediate and surrogate, for his entire duration. I can't get enough of Cooper.What impresses me most about Derek Cianfrance and what he chooses to exercise here as oppose to his last effort, Blue Valentine (2010), he keeps the narrative intimate. As he transitions from one tale to the next, he doesn't get wrapped up in clichéd epiphanies or trite characters that are placed there just to keep the story moving. Each person is given the appropriate detail, flaws and all, moral or immoral, and driven by their motivations that have them meet their ultimate fulfillment, whatever that ends up becoming. I don't think there's anyone who emerges from this film and truly owns it more than Cianfrance.What was interesting and even more surprising is what Cianfrance digs out of Eva Mendes. Always striking and easy on the eyes in anything she's in, she nearly de-glamorizes not only her look but her entire moral being. Vividly engaging, though I'd argue a tad miscast, she makes the most of her screen time and nails every nuance of Romina.When it comes to young actors Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen, they manage to create their own memorable and dynamic representations of troubled youth searching for their purpose. DeHaan where's every ounce of pain on his face, similar to Hayden Christiansen in Life as a House (2001). Compelling and talented, DeHaan magnifies the power of being dedicated to your craft. When it comes to Emory Cohen, he's just pure cinematic enjoyment. He doesn't play the role safe as he makes choices to elevate the aura of AJ. If you ever lived in or around New York, he will feel like almost every kid you've encountered during your time there. I'm anxiously awaiting what Cohen will deliver in the near future.As an awards player, it's one of the best things that the year has offered thus far. A focused and detailed campaign for Original Screenplay and any of the supporting actors are well worth the price of an ad. Bradley Cooper and Ryan Gosling are two feasible entries for consideration. On a technical merit, the film trumps anything that has come stateside this year. Cinematography, Sound Mixing, Sound Editing, and Original Score are four categories, bar none, where the film is in desperate need of recognition. You can't walk away and not be enchanted with some of the shots Bobbitt manages to capture or the music that Mike Patton accompanies one of the film's most emotional and thoughtful moments. He infuses music into the screen like a true professional.Read More Reviews and Oscar Predictions at The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",The Place Beyond the Pines
116,roxmewild,The place beyond Reality,2,14 May 2021,"I happened across this movie when trailing through what Amazon had on offer to watch chose this due to its rating I tend to avoid anything less than 6 on the basis it can't be much good. This movie was a 7+ so good chance you'd think!Just goes to show never read a movie by its rating lolHands up I am Not a Ryan Gosling fan he for me is ok nothing special.Interesting start as in the fair act and the obvious fact Gosling has a gal in each town/ city and Mendez turns up asking did he remember her from his last visitThe fair moves on with Gosling next scene he is returning presumably a year later looks her up finds out she had a kid his kid! Gosling becomes parental all of a sudden and what's to be a dad regardless that she is in a relationship decides he will rob banks to get the money together to support them both { like any parental father would lol} she can't make her mind up and keeps both going till she sees the violent side of Gosling and ends it.The story is so beyond any kind of reasoning at this point but continues on I won't give the whole movie away but seriously the diversions in the story are loopy followed up by the kid at 17 never knowing or meeting his birth father feels so much for him apparently more than the guy that has been his dad from birth
There are more questions why any rational being would take the actions that were taken than understanding of them for me
The Cop keeping the photo of the guy he killed in his wallet is mind boggling alone?Suffice to say the film was incoherent long and very unsatisfying.",The Place Beyond the Pines
117,Al_The_Strange,"""If you ride like lightning, you're going to crash like thunder.""",8,21 April 2013,"I didn't really grasp the full extent of what to expect when I went into this film. Initially, it was the opening act, with Ryan Gosling on a motorbike robbing banks, that appealed to me the most. I half-expected this film to play out like Drive or something. I would come to find that The Place Beyond the Pines is not exactly an action-packed film; there's really only a few major chases. The majority of this film is built on delicately-developed characters and their inevitable collisions.This film is laid out in three distinct acts. The first third of the film is what appealed to me the most, showing a poor man resorting to crime to support a family that constantly eludes him. Then the film switches to the story of a cop who confronts this criminal. The final section concludes with the legacy left behind from these two characters. The whole film is successful at building emotional, believable characters that we can appreciate and relate to. Its triple-layered narrative is interesting, but loses steam by the finale, and is ultimately anticlimactic. Overall, the story is interesting and mostly well-structured, offering an interesting and heartfelt portrayal of corruption on both sides of the law.This film uses some very rough and shaky photography. The action scenes tend to be overly-erratic, but the rest of the film is pretty well-framed. Editing is not bad. This film uses some very gently-nuanced performances, and all of the actors are all quite effective. This production uses some real-looking sets, props, and costumes. Music is especially moody.It's worth watching at least once.4/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Good | Film: Good)",The Place Beyond the Pines
118,ArchonCinemaReviews,"Depressing dramatic saga, superb performance from Gosling",8,19 August 2014,"The Place Beyond the Pines is a depressing film about a motorcycle stunt rider with a limited skill set's decision to provide for his son and the long term ramifications that follow.In reality, the Place Beyond the Pines is a modern day dramatic saga set in upstate New York. The film changes trajectory, tone and subject several times and goes far beyond the breadth of what movie summaries allow you to believe. Yes, it is about Luke Stanton, a risk taking drifter but it's truly about his impact on those around him in the short time he lays roots in Schenectady.Ryan Gosling is enamoring as Luke Stanton, the reserved rebel but loving fatherly hopeful. It is his performance that opens the film and captivates the viewer to remain invested for the rest of the two hour and twenty minute movie. His once paramour and mother to his baby is Romina, played by Eva Mendes. Both roles are taciturn personas but powerful and I believe their real life romance had a substantial impact on the successfulness of this story line. There is substance and honest pain to these characters. Bradley Cooper is in one of his best performances as the conflicted cop.Writer/director Derek Cianfrance produces a beautifully shot and composed film from start to finish with a soundtrack to match by Mike Patton. There are some breathtaking shots that still have a small town feel consistent with the narrative. You will laugh, you will cry, you will gasp and you will cringe and you will ultimately feel.It is my belief that Cianfrance had a fully formed act I, the story brewing in the back of his mind for some time, and had a hard time finding a believable resolution in his act II. Therefore I rate the first half of The Place Beyond the Pines significantly better with the ending feeling a bit contrived. Don't misconstrue this as dislike; I vastly enjoyed this depressingly dark motion picture. It just felt a bit ""Hollywood"", following the trend where everything needs to be significant and connected and relevant.Find more reviews at our website.",The Place Beyond the Pines
119,ethanbresnett,Such a promising start but it quickly tailed off and lost focus,7,13 February 2021,"With such a stacked cast I expected a little more from The Place Beyond the Pines. It's a very solid film, but what was lacking most for me was a strong emotional connection to the characters. Just as I was discovering who they were and starting to get invested, the film would shift gears massively and pull the rug.The Place Beyond the Pines is essentially told in three very clear and defined acts, each following a different protagonist (or set of protagonists). In theory I think this idea was fantastic, but the execution was a little off, especially since the film was at its best in its first act. Once we deviated from this the film started to lose focus and began to meander slightly. It also felt very jumpy, unable to bring its plot threads to a satisfying conclusion.As well as the above, I think the pacing was a little off as the whole thing felt a tad too long.Despite all of this, there is a lot to enjoy about this film. It has some great direction and cinematography. I loved the first 45-60 minutes. The cast were all great, even if their characters were a little hollow at times, and it had some good plot elements and threads.Entertaining, but missed the mark in a few areas.",The Place Beyond the Pines
120,TaylorYee94,The power of minor characters' performance,7,25 August 2021,"When you look at the poster, you go into the movie, thinking 'The Place Beyond the Pines' will be all about Ryan Gosling, being a main character leading the narrative. However, after the movie, I am impressed by performance of all the cast and how all actors bring their best to the characters. Cooper leads the second part of the three portions of the movie. I love the fact Avery is not one-dimensional hero or villain. He is way much more complicated than just a good guy or just a bad guy, and Copper delivers it delicately. The last third part is led by Luke and Avery's respective sons carrying on their fathers' fate. This is the part where the director, Derek Cianfrance, tells the real story he wanted to tell. Emory Cohen and Dane DeHaan express personalities resembling characters' fathers. Dane DeHaan especially succeeds in portraying destructivity and vulnerability at the same time just as Gosling does. The weakness is the impact of the story. I get what the director's trying to tell to the audience, but it is not compact enough.",The Place Beyond the Pines
121,david-meldrum,"Gripping, but over-stretches its main point. Less would have been more.",7,1 December 2014,"You all know it. You've never heard of something, or paid much attention to it. Then you acquire it, find out about it, visit it or  whatever  and then you can't seem to avoid seeing it everywhere. The syndrome is well-known especially with cars – you've never noticed that make of car before, then once you buy one it seems to be in front of you at every set of lights.I had this experience in relation to the fostering journey the other night whilst engaging in one of my other passions: film-watching. It was one of the films that had been clogging up our hard- disk recorder for a while; we'd missed it at the cinema because I think it was one of those that received little or no release in South Africa. It was The Place Beyond The Pines; a fine, engaging and beautifully shot, emotionally driven crime-drama. Ryan Gosling is a motorbike stunt driver who quits his job when he discovers he has a young son in the town his show has stopped off in. In an attempt to buy his way into the son's life he falls into a life of crime, which puts him on an intersecting path with a good policeman (Bradley Cooper) attempting to pick his way through a corrupt police department. It's hard to say much more without significant plot spoilers; but what there is throughout the film is a sometimes effective, sometimes contrived parallel between the two main characters and the their families. As the film progresses we move into a kind of territory where the film almost becomes a parable for the idea of sins of fathers being visited on children – and the chilling reality that could represent. It's never less than involving, though in truth the film loses some impact by over-stretching its point and its running time. As is often the case, less would have meant more.My 'new car' moment side-swiped me somewhere in the film's later stages, when a relatively minor part of the film's story evidenced itself as about fostering/adoption. Previously I'd have brushed over it; it's not a film about fostering and adoption in any way. However three important characters are clearly in this territory. When that dawned on me, the rest of the film became refracted through that lens. Was this how all fostered or adopted children grow up? If they've come from birth backgrounds that aren't supportive, are the children unavoidably destined to be affected by the lives of their birth parents? What is the role of the adoptive or fostering parent, then? Are you destined to fail, or can you make any difference?I'm by nature prone to worry, so I guess it's inevitable that this line of thought would present itself at some point. On deeper reflection too I'm aware of my wife's own experience as an adoptive child: loving adoptive homes make a huge difference. There's always going to be issues, however. Issues of rejection, identity and heritage to name three. The dance between nature and nurture appears to be a complex one indeed.We're on this road now, though. Maybe not forever; and we're not committed to the destination yet. Truth is, we don't even know what the destination is. It's comforting, predictable and also a little strange that all these similar looking cars suddenly seemed to have joined us.",The Place Beyond the Pines
122,avik-basu1889,"You can take the boy out of the wild, but you can't take the wild out of the boy !!!!",8,18 March 2015,"The Place Beyond the Pines is a very ambitious film by ""Blue Valentine"" director Derek Cianfrance. The screenplay makes use of multiple perspective technique and hence different parts of the storyline follows different (but linked) characters from their respective perspectives. The film also paints a vivid picture of the plight of the people residing in the urban suburbs of America. It shows how people struggle day in day out and how lives can be destroyed due to the sheer temporary nature of life in those parts.The film in a way is also Biblical in nature. The script involves themes of paying for your sins, the funny way in which the universe works, how certain things are destined to happen,etc. The score in most parts of the film comprises of soprano singing and choir singing also depicting this biblical element. The screenplay and style of direction is interesting and I remained extremely interested throughout the film. However, I did think there were problems in the script. There were a number of scenes in the middle of the film which felt very contrived and unconvincing. Some convenient coincidences take place throughout the course of the film just for the story to progress. The film also has some unnecessary characters and plot elements that could have been avoided.The film also boasts of a stellar ensemble cast with solid performances coming from everywhere. But I think the best performance of the film comes from Dane Dehaan (who looks like the lovechild of Leonardo Di Caprio and a young Mick Jagger). He is intense and realistic. Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes also deserve a special mention.To conclude, I will admire the director and the screenplay writers for attempting to make an ambitious film. It has its flaws, but it kept me engaged and interested throughout and I cared for the characters, and that is always a good sign.",The Place Beyond the Pines
123,dansview,Their Careers are Garbage,4,16 June 2017,"These actors suck. They keep doing these clichéd movies where they play the sensitive troubled guy or the brooding outsider, with either no range, or some kind of pathetic channeling of their actor heroes.Meanwhile we are supposed to buy the idea that every picture they do is some kind of history-making accomplishment. This movie is pure crap. Silver Lining Playbook was a huge heap of dung too.I'm so sick of us thinking that method actors from the east coast are some kind of Gods. That whole technique is so tired. I prefer subtlety. Like David Straithern.I love the idea of a ""carny"" motorcycle stunt rider, and the setting of upstate N.Y. But that's it.We get to know exactly nothing about our mystery man or his previous relationship with our female lead. Who the heck is her new boyfriend and what does he do? Ray Liotta as a corrupt east coast thug? O.K. there's a new concept. Corruption in an east coast police department? Truly groundbreaking.I hate everyone in this movie. It's not necessary to have a lovable character, but it's nice. But if there isn't anyone to love, then at least let us get to know the bad guys better.As previous reviewers mentioned, almost no one seems to have the slightest moral insight. I'm willing to believe that, but it's not enjoyable to watch. The mom hooked up with a lowlife and is mad at a cop for tracking him down. Even though he violently attacked her current boyfriend and robbed banks.The new black boyfriend was perhaps the only redeeming character, but he doesn't say much.The physical setting was appealing, in terms of the photography of the motorbike and regular bicycle rides through the trees, but the music was total cliché. (Angelic choir voices) Thanks for the violent clichéd scene of teens fighting at a teen party. Never seen that one before.What would have been interesting, is if someone didn't behave exactly as we expected them to. But that would take some creative writing.Don't waste your time with this clinker.",The Place Beyond the Pines
124,kdnor2011,A very well told piece,9,19 June 2013,"The only reason I was interesting in seeing this movie was because of it's cast. Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, and Dane Dehann as well as others. I really wasn't sure what the movie was about before I saw it, I heard it was about a motorcycle rider and a rookie cop and that was about it. And when I was done watching it, I was glad I did.It is a long movie though, not the longest I've ever seen, but very long and it feels like it. But I think it deserves it. The second act can get really confusing and drags for a few moments. And a few of the characters come off as kind of unlikable. And I have a few nitpicks like I thought Gosling should have shown more remorse for the horrible thing he had done, and sometimes it felt a little too ""artsy."" I love the way this movie was told, not to spoil anything but it's actually three stories, all centered around different people that are all connected. And as we see one character find out the story we had seen earlier through the eyes of another character, it was actually really interesting and I wanted to see how it all would end. The acting is great, I'm thankful Ryan Gosling is actually allowed to act instead of doing that underacting quiet man type he did in ""Drive."" And it looks great, I especially love the chase scene where it's shot in mostly first person. And, I know this sounds weird, but it looks real. The film looks like it was filmed in places I have actually seen, and it doesn't feel fake...for the most part. A lot of movies either make it look too good, or try so hard to make it look bad that it becomes comical, the town in this film actually looks like a real town.While it may not be for everyone, believe me there are points where it becomes really slow. This film is defiantly a great film and well worth seeing.",The Place Beyond the Pines
125,markgorman,Maybe just too much to really deliver.,8,5 May 2013,"Sorry ladies. Although Derek Cianfrance's (Blue Valentine) latest movie again features Ryan Gosling he spends the vast majority of it fully clothed - the vast majority that he features in, that is, because by the end of the first act we see the last of his presence as Bradley Cooper moves into centre stage for Act 2. He too largely disappears from the action for most of the third Act, to be replaced by his and Gosling's on screen sons.This is nearly an excellent movie.Although it's long, the final third is spoiled by trying to cram too much action in and ends up becoming not just implausible but slightly confusing - not helped by the ludicrous ""in the hood diction"" of Emory Cohen who is decidedly outplayed by his nemesis Jason, played brilliantly by Dane DeHaan.Gosling plays a wheel of death motorcyclist who, becoming disaffected with the touring life, stumbles upon an ex-conquest Romina, played by Eva Mendes (Gosling's real life partner). In discovering that Mendes has borne Gosling's son but is shacked up, alongside her mother, in the home of new fella Koli (Mahershala Ali - convincing and understated performance - one to look out for) Gosling first goes all doey eyed then sets out to stake his claim on his son Jason.Being penniless (he's jacked his job in remember) he has to earn some dough to impress Jason's mom and so begins a short and haphazard spree of bank robbery alongside doped up partner Robin (a star of the show turn by Ben Mendelsohn).This inevitably ends up going wrong and introduces us to a new main character, the copper with a conscience, Avery, played by Bradley Cooper. Cooper is gradually emerging as a Hollywood A lister after his Oscar nomination for Silver Linings Playbook and The Hangover. And in this he is excellent; studied and calm as the stool pigeon at the centre of a police corruption ring. Bent cops? Who should we cast? Ladies and Gentlemen let's invite Ray Liotta, the face of supreme evil, in for a brilliant cameo.So unfolds what is almost like a second movie. One in which codes of morality, trust and integrity cement the movie's philosophy. He neatly challenges our ideas of who the good guys and the bad guys are and this is what propels us into Act 3.As if these grand themes and this strong narrative drive is not enough Cianfrance is not over. In the third reel he moves the action forward 15 years to show that what goes around comes around and Cooper and Gosling's sons run into one another in unlikely circumstances. Now we really do start to question who, if anyone, can claim moral superiority.It's an ambitious movie mostly well directed but without the taughtness of Blue Valentine. Gosling and Cooper appeal greatly and between them have a great deal of screen time. Mendes slips in and out quietly and unremarkably and Liotta and Mendelsohn do their best to upstage the stars. Ultimately though, my feeling is that Cianfrance has bitten off a little more than he can reasonably expect to chew, which is a shame because there is much to commend about this movie. It certainly represents value for money and is recommended despite its obvious flaws.",The Place Beyond the Pines

It's 3 small movies none of which could stand on their own, stitched together into a cliché riddled saga. The first story with Gosling is cookie cutter depressed mumbling Gosling. The second story is a 70's episode of a TV show about dirty cops it even has Ray Liotta being a dirty cop, I know, where's my fainting couch. The third is the most 'cinematic' replete with morality tales about sins of the father and whatnot. But at the end it's light and fluffy. Not much to it.

127,kgprophet,"Is this an offshoot of ""Dallas"" called ""Schenectady""?",6,12 April 2013,"Like a prime time soap opera, TPBTP plays like the life and times of a smaller town in upstate New York. You get a slice of life in the Police department, the local diner, get a flavour of a small town carnival. Great credit goes to the filmmakers for actually shooting on location instead of Vancouver. One kinda complaint is all the too good-looking actors that betray the small town setting. The films starts with a sense of a larger-than-life world with pulp fiction characters, and then tries to a become a more modern and domestic study of youths in trouble.Of course, this is trying to have your cake and eat it too, grabbing the audience with a wild character who robs banks and lives life on the edge in a romantic way. Sounds like a deliberately fictional caricature that becomes a rebel hero. Instead it switches to a rookie cop who is dealing with a tense confrontation with the bank robber. This works really well, because you are in an explosive situation, not sure if the rookie cop is going to die by making a mistake.To make this transition and make it hold needed too two things. One was a well-cooked script that thoughtfully arranged the conflicts between the characters so tension existed as one character confronted another. Second was strong direction that captured great performances and produced a sense a realism. There is less cinematic flair after the larger-than-life beginning, transitioning into a family drama as parents pay the consequences of not being there for their kids.The movie very well could be called ""Schenectady"" since that is really the common thread that ties the characters and story together. Generational relationships, teenage escapism, police corruption, could be pulled out of a prime time TV drama. Thankfully, it rises above these potentially predictable story arcs, allowing for a more interesting growth in character as they discover their past. Again, these moments of revelation could be the same familiar looking third acts you see even in films like ""The Dark Knight Rises"".In this case we are being taken full circle as we find the son of the bank robber finding his own destiny. Some people may be bothered by the necessary connections between the characters. However, this is a smaller town, and frankly it would be less interesting if these coincidences didn't occur. I think audiences will vary in response to each character study. Some may actually latch on to the third act as the good looking teenagers find themselves getting into trouble. I didn't as much, and as so was less emotionally attached at the end as much as the filmmakers wanted me to be. In hindsight, perhaps it would have been better to focus more on the bank robber's son's mother, who is underwritten. She has a great deal at stake with everything that happens, and is the perfect opportunity to explore how she survives, and what she may have taken upon herself to help bring her kids up properly.With that absent aspect counting as a deficit, I give a 6 out of 10.",The Place Beyond the Pines
128,jamiedarlow-37510,A truly enthralling drama!,10,11 April 2020,"Writer/director Derek Cianfrance's excellent follow up to the heartbreaking Blue Valentine (2010). The epic story spans 15 years and the course of an outlaw and a policeman's children's lives with their experiences intertwining with each other constantly. Luke (Ryan Gosling) is a circus motorcycle performer who turns to crime in order to provide for his ex-partner and son. Avery (Bradley Cooper) is a rookie cop who crosses paths with him during a bank robbery and is trying to make his own way up the ladder through a corrupt police department. There's a major twist quite early on in the film so it's a difficult one to talk about without giving spoilers but ultimately, it's a beautifully made thriller with real emotional heft and outstanding performances. Gosling and Cooper both provide some career best work and there's really fantastic performances also from Eva Mendes, Mahershala Ali, Dane Dehaan and Ray Liotta to name a few. The theme of father - son dynamics and sins of previous generations impacting the future ones is explored perfectly with a real understanding of dramatic tension. The music by none other than Faith No More's Mike Patton is absolutely breathtaking; there are moments such as the motorbike riding down the country road echoed by the bicycle rolling down it, accompanied by a hauntingly good piano piece, that really gave me goosebumps. It holds one of the best chase sequences I've ever seen; proper edge of your seat stuff and in the cinema it was an incredible experience.

Never really seen them shot like this before and for someone who has seen a lot of car chases it was nice to see a different take.A lot of movies try to pull off the ""3 movies in 1"" thing and usually the feel is different and it's hard to get into the new story but I didn't feel that at all. I liked that everyone was bad and everyone was good, it felt natural and realistic. I'm not sure who was supposed to be the protagonist.

130,dvc5159,An ambitious juggling act which pays off,8,10 April 2013,"An extended one-take tracking shot of local daredevil Luke Glanton (Ryan Gosling) heading towards and performing one of his motorcycle stunts opens the film. The camera then frames Glanton and two other bikers spinning around in a metal globe dangerously - perhaps recklessly and unpredictably - a prophetic symbol of things to come.Derek Cianfrance's ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" then throws the audience in for an unpredictable journey between the lives of four characters. This is not a movie which will fulfill your guesses if you think you've seen them all. A wide range of strong character and plot development pulls the film together when it looked like the film could burst apart at the seams. Great cinematography by Sean Bobbitt and an ambitious music score by Mike Patton (with a shade of Morricone, I think?) compliment the film's uneasiness and unpredictability perfectly.In three acts encompassing a time period of 15 years, the audience follows the lives of Glanton, police officer Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper), and their respective sons Jason (Dane DeHaan) and A.J. (Emory Cohen). Gosling continues his strong streak of portraying violent, moody and solemnly stoic lead heroes as the loner Luke, who reawakens his paternal instinct after he discovers he has a kid with an old flame, Romina (a very good Eva Mendes). His decision to rob banks to support them quickly collides with the life of Officer Cross, who is having his own problems with police corruption (you gotta love Ray Liotta as the sneaky corrupt cop). Cooper surprises with a solid, no-nonsense performance displaying a wide range of emotions, evolving from naive to guilt-ridden - proving he could do much more than comedy or romance. It is a good enough performance for the second act of the film to live on. The third act, and this is where the film falters a bit - takes place 15 years after Gosling's and Cooper's segments, and focuses on their character's sons in high school who happen to meet by chance. Both young actors seem natural in their roles, especially DeHaan, fresh off of ""Chronicle"", and again portraying the lonely, painful soul very well.A lot of ""blue collar dramas"" (as some call it) seem to focus on the tough life aspects and ""struggling to make it out of here"" kind of story lines. Some are great, some are good, but make them once, and you've probably make most of them. This film, although you can call it a ""blue collar epic"", doesn't really focus on the ""tough life"" aspect as it does with it's characters. Rather, it focuses on the more philosophical and poetic aspects of storytelling - the circle of of fate and destiny, karma, retribution; all the while balancing it out with other dramatic aspects such as police corruption, crime as a ways of finance and teenage father-son angst, among others. It's a massive juggling act, and Cianfrance and his writers are superb in fleshing these characters within a running time of 140 minutes, and not one character feels like they have worn out their welcome. Cianfrance's ambitious direction perhaps makes the film feel as whole as possible, with the three acts flowing steadily and the switch from the current act to the next feels operatic instead of sudden and rushed. I am reminded of certain mob classics like ""GoodFellas"" and ""The Godfather"" when it comes to this flow, and even though this film by no means is as brilliant as both, it certainly is refreshing and delightful to see a new generation filmmaker be this ambitious and taking risks with his audience.Is this film great? It could be. Just because the plot is something we've seen before, it certainly does not mean the filmmaker cannot do something different with it. Cianfrance and his talented cast and crew certainly have made something different with familiar plot material. It is strongly plotted and acted, and it feels like an opera unfolding itself toward the audience. The film is worth watching, perhaps more than once. I truly haven't seen an American director this hugely ambitious since Darren Aronofsky. One thing is for sure: Cianfrance will be a name to look out for.",The Place Beyond the Pines

132,jackasstrange,"Ambitious, but not impressive",6,30 November 2013,"The Place beyond the Pines is a very stylized film. The cinematography is arguably the highest point of the film, as you can watch in the shaky and ultra realistic sequence of the motorcycle chases, and as well in the stunning panoramic views of the forest. The art design is also very good. But the rest, really not impressive.The best moments in the film so far were about 'Handsome' Luke Glanton story, in the first hour of the film. The events of his life were really catchy, and his character development is much superior than the others characters. The other stories which came after it were just consequences of Luke's death, and then the film starts to get really pointless when it shows Bradley Cooper character's file, because in the end, is not important at all. Sure, it's something different of the somewhat traditional story telling of the non linear narrative, but it's really hard to watch this film after that much pointless events. In a short resume, it focus too much on Bradley's character, instead of giving more focus to Luke's son. But OK, as i always say, i really respect when a film brings something new.The acting didn't impress either, and some parts are really weird. When Handsome Luke is talking to his crime mate about his suddenly stop from the crimes, for example. The acting by Gosling was pretty terrible in that scene. Other notable example would be the overly emotional character portrayed by Eva Mendez, though is much more a problem with the character than with the acting, but still a low point, since that a bad build character results in bad interpretations.All in all, it's something new, and i am pretty sure that no one can deny that...but is a pretty average film as well. 6.5/10",The Place Beyond the Pines

This film comprises an intelligent, well-acted, and well-filmed story that spans two generations, involving a wild but believable chain of coincidences. It has a number of twists and keeps you guessing what will happen next but is very lucid in the end. Without being the least bit heavy-handed, it's revealing of all sorts of things about this life, such as how much the results can differ between those on the ""right"" and those on the ""wrong"" sides of the law even when they're playing basically the same game and aren't much different in their tactics. (Also, how the crime that most often does one in is simply not knowing when to stop and getting caught.) The most common criticisms of THE PLACE BEYOND the PINES seem to be ""too long"" and ""boring."" Granted, it's not an ""action film"" per se; PBP moves at a very natural pace. All the same, plenty happens: I did not find one truly dull stretch throughout its 140 minutes and did not want it to end. While not a happy story in its own right, PBP has its happier moments; while grim and violent in several places, with some mild gore, there's nothing gratuitous in these areas. It's never particularly funny, nor does it try to be, but it's not deliberately humorless either. There are a few blank spots here and there, most of which are probably best left blank. One or two details are also a little hard to buy--e.g., the photo and $ kept by Avery. Yet, viewed from any major angle, THE PLACE BEYOND the PINES is a truly fine film.Great performances by Gosling and Cooper, as well as by Emory Cohen and Dane DeHaan as sons AJ and Jason.

A mini- series format would suit this a hell of a lot better and flesh out the story, where here all the stories feel rushed, yet the film feels endless. The first part of the film with Gosling is the most successful, as we watch this motorcycle daredevil go on a bank robbing spree to leave something for his newborn son. The second act with Cooper is a half assed corrupt cop story with zero payoff. And the last act about Cooper running for public office and tying both his kid and Gosling's kid's fate together, feels extraneous when it should bring the story full circle.

This hauntingly beautiful film chronicles the fall of two families spanning generations. The film starts off as an excellent gritty crime film with some of the best acting out of Ryan Gosling than in any film he has done. This puts the film in a high octane thrill ride that essentially reaches an anti-climactic end. The film then jumps into its second chapter and while Gosling's presence lingers throughout the film, the focus is shifted to Bradley Cooper's inner struggle with himself as he is playing Avery Cross. While this is most definitely the after thoughts of the first act, it is very much a different film all together, thus making the audience feel the heavy lull moment of the film. After the final 45 minutes of the film, we're left with a sour and bitter taste in our mouths as we crave a better ending to an otherwise fantastic film. While Dane DeHane gives an incredible performance, it feels as if he is the only one actual in the moment of the scenes.

As he did with Blue Valentine, he takes the viewer through the experience and it's not usually a happy experience. But it's a thrilling experience of watching great movies at their finest. The director/writer Cianfrance gives the sense in both films that something bad and sad is going to happen, as if the Gosling character is always doomed from the beginning, and you always get that sense from the sound, music score, editing, direction, acting, writing and overall ambiance of both films that something is rotten in Denmark and something tragic will happen. As if in some way there will never be any winning at the end of the rainbow for the Gosling character(in both films).But who better to have in the lead than the modern day James Dean, Ryan Gosling. Gosling was born to play these roles in The Place Beyond the Pines and Blue Valentine. Eva Mendes is at her absolute best here in this film. I really hope she gets nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Academy award for it. She's superb in her role here, and I actually believed full on that she was a homely normie type by the way she played the part, meaning I bought that she was a humble Plain Jane rather than the super model that Mendes is. In Hesher, I didn't buy Natalie Portmann's similar role, so in that respect, score 1 for Mendes. Mendes 1, Portmann 0. The chemistry between Gosling and Mendes is so amazing that you feel like you're waking up from a dream that you had an unbelievably, romantic, love relationship with someone and that you're very sad that you had to wake up from a dream like that as you wanted the romantic relationship to keep going, and that's exactly how you feel with Mendes and Gosling together in this movie, as if it's a dream(makes sense that they are dating in real life, their chemistry is too good here). The whole movie feels like a dream and it's brilliant. You always get the sense of 'the longing for what you can't ultimately have' and that's what makes Cianfrance such a dangerous filmmaker, he is the master at bringing out those feelings and emotions out of the viewer. The Place Beyond the Pines' imagery will be stuck in your head for days and you, the viewer, will be left thinking about this film for many days or weeks or months or years, thinking on how brilliant and great of a movie it is, but thinking on how sad it is too, and you'll be left thinking about your own life, your own dreams, your own happiness and sadness.

""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is one of those movies that will have you asking yourself, ""how did the filmmaker do that?"" Not just technically, but emotionally as well. The filmmaker in question is one Derek Cianfrance. A filmmaker who rose to notoriety with the terribly overrated ""Blue Valentine"". But with the help of the writing team of Ben Coccio and Darius Marder, and I mustn't forget a superbly constructed ensemble, including the likes of Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes, Bradley Cooper, Rose Byrne, Bruce Greenwood and Ray Liotta, Cianfrance has created the best film of the year (so far).""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is a story told in three parts; three story lines which parallel and intersect over and over again in the most breathtaking ways. That said, I don't know how much I can even divulge from each without spoiling this magnificently structured tale of regret. But, here's what I will say: The first part is what I will refer to as ""the Ryan Gosling story"" (on paper, the most powerful of the three). From the initial stunning long take where the camera follows Luke (Gosling) a motorcycle stunt rider, as he walks through a carnival, into the opening of a tent, gets on a motorcycle and takes his place as the third man of a motorcycle stunt team, the audience should realize that they are about to see something special. After the show, Luke runs into an old fling named Romina (Mendes) soon discovering that not only has she moved on (she has a new boyfriend) but also that he has fathered an infant son with her, that he never knew about. Soon he takes it upon himself to attempt to take care of his child by illegal means. Yeah, that's right, he becomes a bank robber.The second story is about Avery (Cooper) a ""good cop"", who becomes disillusioned when he gets mixed up in a corrupt system, fronted by Ray Liotta and his cronies. Kind of like a better version of ""Cop Land"". Oh, and Avery also has an infant son.The third story concernswell I can't really tell you without spoiling anything. Just know that in this final act (which was my favorite) is where the story lines converge into Greek tragedy proportions. And it's funny because this is the storyline that, on paper, is the weakest of the three and for a moment seems like it's going to fall apart upon the initial reveal; but it doesn't. In fact, it is the two performances from the up and coming Dane DeHaan (Chronicle) and a captivating performance from virtual unknown Emory Cohen (who personally stands as my favorite performance of the film) which carry the final thirty minutes of this movie.The reason this Triptych format is one of the most well constructed I've ever seen, is simply because audiences don't have to wait until the final act for the stories to converge. The brilliance lies in Cianfrance's ability to cause his three stories to intersect over and over again throughout the entire film. Which leads me to undoubtedly the most interesting factor of this movie; i.e. how it is almost entirely predicated on contrivances. OK, so of course a movie where multiple story lines converge into one is going to have contrivances; contrivances dealing with chance meetings or dealing with introducing major characters in the late second act or early third. But let me tell you, though there are many ""chance meeting"" contrivances here, Cianfrance, Coccio and Marder have constructed such an airtight script, that nothing seems far-fetched or unbelievable for a second.The Acting: As exceptional as the acting was throughout (yes, even from Eva Mendes) the performance which may steal the show for many, may not be from the actor you think. Not to say Gosling isn't doing his thing here, but Cianfrance isn't the first person to recognize what Gosling can do with a single longing gaze. And basically Gosling, through no fault of his own, puts forth a performance which we (as viewers) are accustomed to seeing. But, Bradley Cooper is simply on another level here, putting forth a stripped down performance, which is in turn the best performance of his career.Final Thought: As a forewarning, I should state that ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is one movie which is meant to put its audiences through the emotional ringer. So if you aren't in the mood for something heavy, then you may want to see ""Oblivion"" or ""Scary Movie 5"" or some other mindless piece of crap like that. But if you are in the mood to see a film that will undoubtedly still be on everyone's lips come Oscar season, then this is not a movie to miss. Everybody is different, but when I see a great scene, a scene that engages me fully, a scene which transcends film altogether, it makes me smile. Suffice to say, throughout this film, I was all smiles. That statement leads me to this final question: This movie is so fantastic that even though it's only April, what could possibly come out this year that is going to be better than ""The Place Beyond the Pines""?

140,nesfilmreviews,"a highly ambitious melodrama, delivered on an epic scale",8,5 September 2013,"""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is a highly ambitious melodrama, delivered on an epic scale involving multiple characters that boasts an engrossing cinematic atmosphere, with an impassioned emphasis on humanistic elements. Director Derek Cianfrance has crafted a sweeping three-act story with considerable skill that follows a chronological structure where each narrative rarely intersects. It has the scope and depth of a novel, and puts its trust in the audience to have the patience.The first story, and unquestionably the strongest, is about Luke (Ryan Gosling), a stunt-bike rider who learns that he has a son by one of his ex-lovers, Romina (Eva Mendes). Ready to man up, he decides to swap his life riding the ""Cage of Death"" at local fairs to spend time with his new-found family. Problem is, Luke doesn't have the money. It doesn't take much for his new boss and drinking pal Robin (Ben Mendelsohn), to convince him that they are better off robbing banks, while utilizing Luke's motorcycle skills to evade police. But soon Luke gets greedy, and a robbery goes terribly wrong. In a split second, the focus completely shifts to a seemingly mild-minded street cop named Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper), who has his own agenda and story -- and yet his life and Luke's become inevitably entwined.The second story follows Avery, and the mood and tone of his narrative is distinctly different from Luke's. However, his inner turmoil is equally compelling however for different reasons. Avery also has a son AJ (Emory Cohen), but his eventual political aspirations keep him from being a caring and attentive father. Both of these men feel guilty for their failures as fathers and sons, and they both try to correct mistakes with worse ones, setting in motion unintended consequences for the next generation.Both of these stories culminate into a 15 year fast-forward when the audience then sees how Luke and Avery's characters have impacted their own children. What's so fascinating about the structure of the film is how the story is not about any one individual character, but collectively how these characters have either been impacted by their father, and/or how they impacted their own son. The narrative uniquely strips away identifying a main character of ""Beyond the Pines."" Instead, it is the father and son dynamic fleshed out that acts as the central theme to the film.Mike Patton's beautiful score and Sean Bobbitt's mix of claustrophobic, extended shots creates an ambiance of a grand spectacle spanning generations, yet selecting only a handful of individuals who we get to know very well, and how their lives intersect. In regards to storytelling alone, ""Beyond the Pines"" is a formidable endeavor. Unfortunately, due to its ambitious, unconventional approach, it weakens the connected narrative in the third act. Nonetheless, it's impossible to deny its overall overpowering cumulative effect.",The Place Beyond the Pines
141,CineCritic2517,Aimless and annoying,1,17 March 2013,"Gosling once again signs up for a project unbecoming his talents in a drag of a film strung together from weak thematic clichés. With a bit of this and a bit of that, the movie tries to cover multiple generations of bad upbringing, corruption and the consequences of these. But there is nothing really convincing here and certainly not something you haven't already seen a thousand times before in the many productions covering the very same ideas.The film simply lacks focus, likable characters, a point and fails to provide an incentive during the lengthy running time to care about whatever outcome the movie might bring. 30/100",The Place Beyond the Pines
142,harrylosborne,A promising beginning that devolves into tedium,6,18 June 2019,"The Place Beyond the Pines essentially divides into two loosely connected storylines: one follows motorcycle-prodigy-turned-robber Luke (Ryan Gosling) trying to provide for his daughter, whilst the other details rookie cop Avery (Bradley Cooper) rising through the ranks of a corrupt institution. Unfortunately, only the former really holds emotional weight and the interest of the viewer - the latter falls flat, leaning heavily on a mediocre story and some questionable acting. The end product is a let-down, promising so much early on without having enough substance to really deliver; you're almost tempted to feel sorry for Gosling, who does all he can to really elevate his prominent role without enough support from elsewhere.The opening shot following Gosling through the twisted routes of a fairground at night time sets the tone beautifully, a botched amalgam of dried mud, harsh lights and grimy metal. Gosling himself plays a less refined, grittier version of his character in Drive (2011), pitch-perfect in demonstrating his desire to both help his family, whilst also prone to violent tendencies. The early scenes of his first bank heists are realistic and rough, but begin to give way to the role Avery embodies in the later stages of the film. Cooper himself is not at fault, but his character feels somewhat wooden given the nature of the film up to that point. The lack of cohesion between these two tenuously interwoven stories makes watching less enjoyable than it should be - the centre portion of the film even involves a time-skip of around 15 years, a misjudged requirement of a story without sound foundations.The real travesty to me is the reliance on the child actors in the latter portions of the story. Their roles haven't been invested in, so they are superficial characters that you have no emotional connection to. Even with their unique relevance to the progress of the film, they certainly do not do the central premise justice (not that this is entirely down to them). The Place Beyond the Pines shows vision and director Derek Cianfrance's quality, but future projects would do well to show greater refinement.",The Place Beyond the Pines
143,MrPupkin,"A riveting tale of parenting and legacy that spans many years, The Place Beyond The Pines is like three movies in one.",8,4 April 2020,"Ambitious filmmaking is welcome, but usually ambition leads somewhere, which is the main problem with co-writer and director Derek Cianfrance's unwieldy 140-minute multi-generational crime drama, The Place Beyond the Pines. First we watch Luke (Ryan Gosling) as a traveling motorcyclist enter a life of crime to support his infant son. Next the focus shifts to Avery (Bradley Cooper) as a cop with a conscience running into corruption on the force. Last, we jump ahead into the future and watch the dramatic irony unfold as the children of Avery and Luke interact, waiting for them to learn their paternal connection. I believe Cianfrance (Blue Valentine) and his team was attempting to tell a meditative, searching drama about children paying for the sins of their fathers, the lingering fallout of bad decisions and moral compromises. Except that's not this film. By the end of the movie, while some secrets have been laid bare, there really aren't any significant consequences. The film does an excellent job of maintaining a sense of dread, but it doesn't come to anything larger or thought provoking. The entire structure of this film is geared toward a tragic accumulation, but it just doesn't materialize. That's a shame because it's got great acting through and through, though I have grown weary of Gosling's taciturn antihero routine that seems like a rut now. Avery's portion of the plot was the most interesting and anxiety-inducing, but I found the movie interesting at every turn. The characters are given pockets of nuance and ambiguity as they traverse similar paths of desperation and conciliation. The Place Beyond the Pines is a perfectly good movie, albeit disjointed, that cannot amount to the larger thematic impact it yearns for.",The Place Beyond the Pines
144,rgblakey,Your actions can change more than just your life in the Place Beyond the Pines,6,14 August 2013,"There are a lot of movies that come out to critical acclaim but never really get the release they should have. This often has to do with the chances taken to tell the story, but often it's just a studio issue. The Place Beyond the Pines features a great cast including Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, Eva Mendes, Ray Liotta and Blue Valentine director Derek Cianfrance at the helm, but does it deliver? The Place Beyond the Pines follows series of events that interconnect a group of people. When a stunt motorcycle rider discovers he has a child with a former lover he does whatever he can to make things right and provide for them including robbing banks, but when things spiral out of control his encounter with a rookie police officer will change both of their lives forever for years to come. This is a cleverly crafted film that is split into 3 stories, but all a part of a larger story. The first half of the film is a bit slow, but once it was over was actually necessary for the overall film. Everyone in this film give great performances, but Gosling and Cooper really drive it home. The structure to this film is really bold as it is not all that hard to figure out where it is probably heading, but does do some clever misleading from time to time. The motorcycle sequences really set the tone with the bank robberies and turn things up a notch getting the film on track and it stays there. This isn't an action movie, but does sport a bit here and there, but mostly this is a character story and a story of legacy and how actions can affect things through your entire life.Besides the slow moments there are a few aspects here that seem to be stretched out a bit more than needed and slows the pacing down, but the overall film delivers a great story and great performances. Stick through the slow pacing of the beginning of the film and you are in for a great film.",The Place Beyond the Pines

146,vailsy,lots of super super stereotypical characters,6,11 May 2014,"this movie tries hard to be street-wise but it falls into stereotype with really shallow and bland charactersRyan Gosling plays the tanned, tattooed pretty bad-boy. I think Gosling has potential as an actor and seems to want to be authentic and do great things but he is just wasting himself on parts like this as far as I'm concerned. Stop looking in the mirror and act damn it. The significance of this first chapter is that the 'likeable bad guy' steals $15000 from banks we then abruptly go on to look at police corruption, only once again it is handled in a really unsubtle ham-fisted way. No doubt police corruption exists in the real world but since police deal with the law on a daily basis we can assume that they know how to cover their tracks a little better than is presented here. Here Liotta and crew are so obviously 'bad cops' that it is quite ridiculous, and about as subtle as Magnum Force (watch it instead, it's better). The significance of this chapter is not that is smartly interweaves with chapter one, but that the bad cops re-steal the $15000 and like to plant drugs on hookers The final instalment is about the sons of the first two parts. Emery Cohen is supremely annoying, once again a really stereo-typical 'bad kid' character. Actually the only bit he gets right is that he is irritating. This section of the movie supposedly is designed to have special significance.. a tying up of the story, as if the first 2 chapters were some epic mega-mystery that justifies this treatment. Unfortunately there is no interesting story to unravel and so this final chapter comes across as misplaced and farcical Stereotypical career climbing police man then becomes president or something like that, son of stereotypical criminal rides off into the sunset on fathers motorbike with wildlife wide-shot and rustic music. The endIt's possible to present real people in real situations in a smart and creative way. The Place Beyond the Pines does not achieve that",The Place Beyond the Pines

The acting is really fantastic by all involved even the minor characters. The Characterized is brilliant and you really feel a strong connection to every character in this, whether good or bad.Story:
I really loved this story. Without spoils it has action a twisted love interest and a extremely interesting character the half the plot is based around and then its like watching a whole other movie the 2nd half! I've never in my life been so surprised at this movies length because it felt so upbeat and new even though it was over 2 hours long. This has a dramatic and action packed first half then a ultra realistic and heart felt 2nd half. My only complaints is how luke fell off his bike was super over dramatized and shouldn't of happened especially since he's such a good rider. Then Bradley coopers son in the movie is a complete waste of air and I didnt like the performance. Also the ending was a bit strange and not so satisfying but it wasn't horrible by any means, just some questions left up in the air but other than those minor complaints it was fantastic.Summary:

Gosling and Cooper both have sons who are one-year-old when the fateful day happens; and the sins of the fathers will come back to haunt their sons 15 years later.My most memorable, movie moment of ""The Place Beyond The Pines"" is the scene when Cooper is pulled over by a fellow cop, played by Ray Liotta. Cooper has snitched on some cops, you see, and one of those cops is Liotta. Liotta, known for his intense, fearsome stares, has not lost his touch, as evidenced by this scene.""The Place Beyond The Pines"" is an odd duck because it doesn't follow the typical 3 act structure of virtually all movies. It feels like 2 acts followed by 3 acts. Let me explain. The first 1/3 of the movie is Gosling's story, then the last 2/3 of the movie is Cooper's story as well as the two sons of Gosling and Cooper. Basically, at the 50 minute mark, it's like watching another moviea sequel to the first 1/3 of the movie, if you will. We get this huge build up, and then the movie flatlines as we are introduced to a whole new set of characters. Surprisingly, this does not harm the movie overall. Why? Because almost everything else works like magic.Two little shenanigans though that I can't let go: 1) Cooper's son is a problem teen, and Cooper doesn't implement any kind of measures to keep his teen from having an out of control party while Cooper is away; 2) a character buys a motorcycle in cash, and immediately rides offno license, no registration, no plates, no insurancehow far does this guy think he can go before he sees flashing blue and red lights behind him?""The Place Beyond The Pines"" is like a slow burning, dramatic mini-series that takes its time to develop the story and characters.

149,maximovlE,Leaves a bitter taste.,1,24 June 2020,"A great cast, and a great beginning. Watching this movie while knowing nothing about it or what the plot-line was took me on an 'interesting' journey. The first of three segments was mostly good, although felt it lacked direction in places. The second segment felt like I'd switched channels and was watching a completely different movie. Either of the two could possibly have been made into separate movies, almost. The second felt like a totally different production. Was that the aim?The third segment however, in my opinion, destroyed the movie. All the characters had become unlikable. Cooper had started as the hero but had become, without trying to make this a spoiler, very unlikable. I guess that's why his offspring was such a vile character. By the end I was really hoping for almost all the cast to be killed off. Again, trying to avoid spoilers, the whole third segment was just a mess, and left me feeling I had just wasted over two hours.Could I give it more than 1 star? Not really. Segment 3 was so bad it killed off any stars the first segments had earned. I just wish someone had told me to skip this movie.",The Place Beyond the Pines

I Would be surprised if this film does not make more than a few men reassess the role of fatherhood.I thought it was great. Very long, it was definitely really a long film, I know that that will be a complaint that a lot of people will lob at it. But I still thought it was exceptional. The performances were great, and the story was definitely epic. In spite of the enormous run time, I never lost interest. And in spite of the fact the central point of view jumps around like a hot potato, the tension was always high. There was always something very intense happening. The bank robbery scenes and get aways are very harrowing.This was a very well acted film. There are some really terrific scenes and the movie turns on you in ways that you wouldn't expect.

152,FilmMuscle,A Daring and Epic Accomplishment,10,9 September 2013,"Derek Cianfrance already amazed me with Blue Valentine- a tragic view of awry marriages- and so, there was no way I was going to miss out on his next project. What you get from The Place beyond the Pines is another tragic (epic) tale about fathers and sons and the decisions they make that end up shaping the rest of their lives. It's gripping and saddening, and it starts off with Luke (played by Ryan Gosling), a motorcycle stunt rider who's living a troubled life, attempting to reclaim his love, Romina (played by Eva Mendes), and their child, but as she's trying to start a new life with a new man, life couldn't get worse for Luke. From there on, he starts robbing banks, trying to make a living and provide support for his lover and kid who aren't living the best of lives either in an impoverished area. Now, I'd prefer to keep the premise as brief as possible because this is the kind of film you need to see for yourself without reading up any summaries, synopsis, etc. I, myself, avoided any further information on the film, and that's exactly why I left surprised and extremely satisfied. The plot of the film is just brilliant as it follows a completely unpredictable and edgy structure, and you're left witnessing a grand- scaled life story with numerous characters all interconnecting with their involvement in the whole of it. The story is compelling- it's deep, and it's memorable. It commences with a focus on one individual in particular and his actions throughout a miserable life and ends up involving and affecting many more. There's simply no way to stress just how riveting and originally-structured the whole work is, and it's a true modern epic that actually takes influence from a traditional Greek tragedy. Oh, and dear god, the soundtrack of the film- something that stunned my ears. I strongly commend Mike Patton and Arvo Part (for a certain track he created, which happens to be my favorite) for the music in all its touching beauty. At times, it's truly haunting, bringing tears to your eyes as you view the unfortunate situation various individuals found themselves in. In fact, some of the music really reminds me of Thomas Newman's style. Anyways, at other times, the music becomes daunting and frightening as it picks up in sync with an intense and perilous event. Just like with the story/plot, I can't emphasize the excellence and emotion, streaming from its violins, of the music enough. Now, that's already two perfect elements of the film, and it doesn't stop there. Another striking department is the performances its actors deliver throughout its unraveling. Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, and Dane DeHaan all immediately stand out with their distinctive and realistically sympathetic characters. Eva Mendes was also quite exceptional, and then, there's even more additions to the superb cast with the likes of Ray Liotta, Bruce Greenwood, and more. This film will definitely be a highlight on their resumes as they convince the audience why they deserve to be as highly praised as they currently are. In addition, one of the most important aspects of a film has to be its cinematography. Without impressive cinematography, a film isn't highly likely to be remembered decades after its release, which is why works like Citizen Kane are still remembered to this day. Yes, The Place beyond the Pines even perfects with its cinematography, which is immensely immersive and intriguing. During the intense motorcycle chases or rides, the film chooses to take the shaky-cam approach, which instantaneously conveys a faster pace and encompasses you from leaving this world. Other shots show a vast landscape of the woods or a gritty city where even the casual viewers can't help themselves from appreciating the sheer quality of its camera-work and visuals, overall. The camera takes you on an intimidating trip through the forest several times, which continues to serve as a motif throughout the story. In relation to its cinematography, the stunts portrayed shock you. For instance, the film opens up with what could be an infamous scene in the coming years: three motorcycle riders entering a fairly small-sized globe (something that would make anyone with claustrophobia faint) with two riding around its walls as the third one remains at the bottom. How this was done will surely stay in your mind for, at least, the rest of the film. Reading up on behind-the-scenes news, the cinematographer (Sean Bobbitt) ""was nearly killed but was instead knocked unconscious when a motorcycle landed on top of him."" Such an occurrence displays just how much dedication was put into the film. In addition, Bradley Cooper and Ryan Gosling are both responsible for their stunts in the movie, which is astonishing as well. Continuing on, although the film's duration's at 140 minutes, the pacing is so terrific that I never once thought about or wished for it to end. The story remains engrossing and persistently leads to another disquieting event after another. The ones who complain are possibly just intolerant to lengthy films overall because I did not find the movie's pacing slow at all. What clearly helps with the film's emotional journey, admittedly tearing you up inside too many times, is its strong characterization and development. Every character carries their own personal traits, and many of them are so richly detailed and believable that you can't help but feel sympathy despite their flaws.

155,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film Review: Three for the price of one.,8,9 March 2013,"The Place Beyond The Pines is one of those films that just completely catches you off guard with all that it delivers. From the opening one shot that follows Luke (Ryan Gosling) to perform in his current job as a stunt cyclist to the bumpy cycle ride through the forest through to the expansive view of the final scenes, this film is shot very artistically. I found the construction of this tale to be intriguing as it is a compilation of three interlaced stories that delved into the dynamic relationship between fathers and sons and a varied number of other situations that play out the drama of the human condition. Luke encounters Romina (Eva Mendes) shortly before he is to leave town and makes a surprising discovery that takes him into a series of events that lead to the pivotal moment when he meets Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper). The Avery Cross meeting with Luke is the point at which the tale takes a turn and now follows his life. The third act of the film takes place fifteen years later when other chance encounters bring all the high drama to full circle. I enjoyed the film and really appreciated the subtle nuances that characterized the powerful impact of having a present father makes on a young man and conversely the struggle and the void created by an absent father. I was especially impressed by the performances. I have never considered Ms. Mendes to be more than mediocre in her roles, however having seen her portrayal of Romina with such depth and emotion has made me reconsider the value that I placed on her talent, she has now redeemed herself from that awful performance as Roxanne in Ghost Rider. Mr. Gosling and Mr. Cooper are always fine thespians, but I did not expect the young actors to deliver such raw emotion to their roles as did Jason (Dane Dehaan) and AJ (Emory Cohen) who both brought credibility to their characters. The story was for the most part character driven, no much in the special effects category but there were several sequences with stunt cycling and a car chase or two, but the action is by far not what makes this film worthwhile, the film had heart. I was completely engaged, I understood the characters and I understood when there was a crisis of conscience. The story was well written and it was entertaining.

His path collides head-on with Bradley Cooper, a rookie cop in a department full of corrupt bullies in THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES.This is one of those films where the less you know about the story, the better. The film is divided into three parts, where the main character shifts but the story continues. Ryan Gosling to Bradley Cooper to Dane DeHaan, who delivers the best performance. Although the writing is conceptually interesting, we're never given enough time to fully empathize with the characters after the first shift. The first part is slow-paced and we feel like we're in the character's shoes. The second part moves faster, the film peaks with some real thrills then slows back down for the third part, which is unfortunately predictable. The ending is as typical as it gets.

Gosling and Cooper does something very well here, they become their characters, characters that are very much human, you can find things to dislike and like, hate and love, in both of them.The rest of the movie unfolds in a way that mostly seems just about how life can go sometimes. And like life, it's often unpredictable.The movie is very slow and melancholic. And this is the problem I often have with movies like this. Yes, it's very beautiful, well made, well acted, just a really good movie. But it's also too slow and sad. But very very good.",The Place Beyond the Pines
160,midas-jacobs,Had a excellent beginning,8,7 February 2016,"I am sorry if I compare this movie a lot with ""Drive"" I think that they are very similar movies (style and characters), except that this movie is less violent.""The place beyond the pines"" is about Luke. Luke is a stunt motor driver. He is a 'normal' guy, but due to a event, he starts to rob banks and gets turned down the wrong ally. The directing was absolutely fantastic. This was done by Derek Cianfrance. I thought that it was very well done, and that isn't the only thing that was well done. So was the cinematography, this was done by a man who goes under the name of Sean Bobbitt. He hasn't always done great movies, but he has also worked on ""12 years a slave"". As in that movie and in this, the cinematography was absolutely beautiful. Every shot, looked like, and I am a bit exaggerating right now, a piece of art. A combination of these elements (the directing and cinematography) you get a fantastic beginning scene. This was all done in one take, or they make it at least look like it was done in one take. We follow Luke while he is walking through the fair, and gets on his motorcycle. In this one scene we get to know Luke a bit. The editing was good, I don't really have to say something about this subject. The soundtrack was really good. A lot of the songs were very nice to listen to, and fitted the theme of the movie very well. The thing that I also very much liked, are the car scenes, and also just the chase scenes overall. There was a lot of tension, STEADY cam, no shaky cam, luckily. By using shaky cam often, what they didn't do, you can ruin a movie for me. The action was fine too. There isn't a lot of action as you may think. The costumes were great. It helped to give Ryan Goslings character more character. By wearing the T-shirts inside out, etc. Make-up was nothing to special. The beaten up face of Dane Dehaan was fine looking. But now it looks like I thought that this movie was flawless. Well it isn't. My problem with this movie is that they split the movie up in 3 different story lines. But more on that later.Now let's talk about the acting. There are three different main characters, and three 'helpers' that I am going to discus. But let's start of with the first main character we meet. This is Luke, or as they call him in the beginning 'Handsome Luke'. Luke is played by Ryan Gosling. His character reminded me a lot of the character he played in ""Drive"". And that is because they are more or less the same. I didn't mind though. He is very good as both of these characters. I understand why people will complain about this. Luke was also a very interesting character. There are some arcs for him, and good character development. Luke was the main character from the first part of the movie. Now the second main character. He was the main character of part two. This was Avery. Bradley Cooper played him. I have seen a lot of Bradleys roles, so I can say with a lot of certainty that he was really great in this movie. Avery is a agent that does something in the movie, that also 'sets up' the third part of the movie. And in this part the main character is played by Dane Dehaan. The character he played is called Jason. I can't say who Jason is without spoiling the movie. But Dehaan did a fantastic job at being him. A decision he makes at the end of the movie, was kind of weird for me, but more on that later :)Now that I have handled the protagonists of this story. Now the helpers. And as I did with the protagonist, I am going over them in a chronological order. The first one is Romina. Eva Mendes interpreted this character. She has some interesting news for Luke, which starts the movie. She was good. Then, in the same act, we meet a man called Robin. He was played by Ben Mendelsohn. Due to him Luke gets in to the ban robbing stuff. And about this part, well these parts, because he doesn't stop with one bank. These sequences were tense full, and well executed. The bank robbing scenes were definitely one of my favorite scenes. And now the last person I am going to discus. He wasn't really a 'helper' at all, he was more a antagonist, but if I tell you why, I will again spoil things. But the person I am talking about is AJ, played by Emory Cohen. He was fine, nothing to special about him.Now finally, the script. This was written by Derek Cianfrance, Ben Coccio and Darius Marder. My main complain with this script is that there are three story's. The first story was very good, I really liked it, it was compelling with great action and characters. But with the second part is my problem. It was just to boring for me. Bradleys acting didn't save it for me. Luckily the third part redeemed itself, and made the movie good again. Now the ending. This was a bit anticlimactic. NOW I AM GOING IN SPOILER TERETORY. I was really disappointed when Jason didn't kill Avery. It does make sense he did, though. This ultimately shows, that he isn't like his father. NO SPOILERS. Overall the writing was really good, some good dialogue, but nothing memorable.This movie was a great movie, with some flaws. It wasn't as good as ""Drive"".",The Place Beyond the Pines

If you're tired of all the formula flicks this may be just the right one for you. There have been a number of past films with three or more stories, some connected, some less so. But this film is (to me at least) unique in that it follows one protagonist for a time, then switches to follow another, and finally winds up following still another. All are of course closely connected, so you always know you're watching one story unfold as the film progresses. Everyone does a good job in the various roles and while the pace is measured, the film is always beautifully filmed and keeps you watching, trying to guess what's going to happen next. It's hard to describe much of this without getting into spoilers, and I don't want to do that. Some may find the storyline a bit contrived and predictable, but on the other hand, done differently it probably wouldn't have been so satisfying. A thoroughly enjoyable film. I give it a thumbs up.",The Place Beyond the Pines
164,AbhiMathews,The Lives of Others,5,25 May 2013,"The Place Beyond the Pines tells the tale of a motorcycle stunt rider and his clashing with the law. As the professional driver turns to criminality as a way of life, he sets himself up on a dangerous path. A young cop, working for a corrupt police department, sees himself eye to eye with this perpetrator and acts on the line of duty. One would consider this enough gunpowder for one story, but director Derek Cianfrance manages to add in a twist; the lives of the robber's and the police officer's sons. Fast forward about two decades later and you have two ruffians who think they know the system. One is a repulsive teenager who manages to stir up trouble wherever he travels. The other is a lonely kid who seems to end up in the wrong place at the wrong time. The addition of the stories from two different generations in one movie is a style many directors avoid, and with good reason. Although the content was very emotional and the acting riveting at moments, the structure of the movie breaks apart-especially towards the end.Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper do an exceptional job in their respective roles and display how vastly different lives conflict. Their lives display the hardships of life both above and under the law. The stresses of maintaining a family is a prevalent theme that constantly reminds the viewer of the repercussions one generation can have on another. The parenting, or lack thereof, for both boys demonstrates the importance of solid relationships and really pulls at your strings since their situations are relatable.Despite the great acting and deep storyline, the delivery of the plot fails to entice viewers for the entirety of the movie. The changing characters at the end made the movie confusing to watch because relating to any single person was quite difficult since a lot had already occurred. People had transformed over the years and the exact situations different characters were facing were hard to predict. I strongly believe this movie had a lot of potential and maintained a great story for a large portion of the movie, but sadly, the second half of the movie did not mirror the first.",The Place Beyond the Pines

In fact it would have been a really powerful film. As it is, it's still on while I write this review. That's how bored I got.

166,JohnnyPHreak,A story of coincidences and family through a generation,8,1 August 2014,"Do things in life happen for a reason or are they just happenstance? That is a question many have asked their entire life. Sometimes coincidence is just there waiting in the wings to pop it's head and make a person think ""hmm"". The Place Beyond The Pines is a bit of both. There is so much negative that happens that leads to so much positive. It's all brought together at times by coincidence and other times just genetics. I've seen movies that can be depressing with family drama. There are films made that have an uplifting family message at the end of all the drama. I can say without a doubt that this film is depressing and uplifting. Ryan Gosling stars as a drifter who comes back to ""home"" to find out that the woman he had a fling with (Eva Mendes) is the mother of his child. Trying to do right by her and his child instead of drifting away again, he stays to become something in their lives. This complicates things more than anything. He resorts to robbing banks to survive and provide. From there this small story of family gets more complicated when a run in with a cop (Bradley Cooper) changes everyone's lives forever. That's all I can speak about the plot because anymore and I would be diving into spoiler territory. It's so funny that we all know Gosling is a ""pretty face"" but the dude can act and in the scenes he's in you are fixated on him. He holds the film in until Cooper shows up. Another ""pretty face' that's got acting skills. He does a nice balancing act of cop trying to do the right thing, struggling with his family, and facing the choices he makes. Dane DeHaan shows up about half way in as a teenager who missed a big part of his life, being an outcast but trying to connect to something. Eva Mendes is okay with what she has to do. Rose Bryne shows up in a very small role as Cooper's wife. Her scenes are awkward but in the well rounded story they fit. Ray Liotta eats up a few scenes as fellow cop with secrets. This whole film runs by is the consequences of people's actions. What they do in the past sets the stage for the future. And a lot of people struggle with what they've done. It eats away inside and makes their choices selfish but selfish for reason of family. And that is the running theme through the film is what humans in tough situations do for their family. Sometimes in family history can repeat it self and history can tear a person apart. The directing is excellent, technically with great shots. The cinematography is beautiful. The film utilizes the upstate New York to it's advantage. It's crispy but drab with muted but vibrant colors. I don't know how it is possible but The Place Beyond The Pines is a story about history shaping the future, family and the struggles of life all set around two families. By the end of this film you might be thinking to yourself were those coincidences in your life set by the people that came before you. Hauntingly beautiful, depressing and uplifting all at once, I can't express how much the film just knocked me on my behind.",The Place Beyond the Pines
167,brent_or,Meandering But Ultimately Inspiring,7,28 January 2014,"After finally seeing The Place Beyond the Pines, I feel less certain about how to rate it than I expected to. First of all, it is far more than the tightly focused story that I was expecting. This is more of a sprawling, slow-burning personal epic and the cast extends far beyond Gosling/Cooper/Mendes/Liotta. Great cast.The story meanders through basically three separate segments, as others have mentioned. It holds together, but more loosely than most films. The tone has a bit of similarity to Drive at times, but again this one is less a snapshot and more a photo album.I would say that the early parts of The Place Beyond the Pines work pretty well, and the ending is terrific. That is, the takeaway is great. But the midsection lags a bit, partly because it drifts from the core plot, and partly because of Bradley Cooper and the actor who plays his son. The characters are well-enough written (other than the son's inexplicable accent) but the actors just do not fit the film very well. Maybe it's just because I am not a fan of Cooper; I don't find him compelling in most things.Anyway, this film is certainly worth watching. It has its moments, drama and emotion, and ends on a perfect note. I give it 7/10 based on the overall impression, even though part of me feels that 6/10 might be a truer rating.",The Place Beyond the Pines
168,clacura,It is about character development!,8,20 October 2016,"This movie really excelled because of excellent directing. All the stars were stars. There are a reason certain actors rise to the top and it is because they are able to act. Too simple? Go to an acting class. Gosling plays these drifter characters brilliantly. His character here is similar to that in Drive. I got wind of Gosling in Fracture and he jumped to the ""A"" list instantly. Never a fan of Eva Mendes, but I have turned a leaf. If you are ridiculously pretty you have a lot of overcome, and she did so here. Her facial expressions and under acting displayed her confidence (again, excellent direction). The entire cast was superb!Those complaining of story miss the point. The story was strong enough, but the acting on every level made this a very emotional experience, and that means the movie was very good. This plot introduced something new, two babies that grow up apart but have much in common. The six degrees of separation always works.Two thumbs up for this one!",The Place Beyond the Pines
169,toddg-473-289818,"Three distinct subplots, and a misleading title",7,22 December 2014,"Yup, even in spite of the headline above, I still give this movie 7 stars, because of it's consistency...gritty, tragic, and searching for redemption. The movie starts with Ryan Gosling as a thuggish bank robber, short on words, trying ineptly to win back the love of his baby mama, played by Eva Mendes. Gosling's temperament in his portrayal is excellent...calm, steely eyes, even demeanor, except in the moments when he feels wronged or is robbing banks, when he explodes into violent fits of rage. Feeling the walls closing in on him as he is pursued by police after a robbery, he makes a final call to Eva Mendes, asking that their son not know about his father the criminal.The movie transitions into act two here, with Bradley Cooper as the police officer who has to confront Gosling in a shootout. After Gosling is killed and Cooper is wounded, Cooper travels down the road of hero cop, plagued by guilt of killing a man who had an infant son roughly the age of his own infant son. Cooper then struggles with getting readjusted to family life, while discovering corruption within his small, upstate NY police department. Noteworthy here is a strong performance by Ray Liotta as a calculating and intimidating veteran cop. Feeling no way out, Cooper seeks the advice of his father, a retired state supreme court justice, and embarks on an ambitious journey to confront the corruption head on and seek higher political office.Cut to act three, set 15 years later, when both Gosling's and Cooper's sons wind up interacting in high school, both loners and outcasts who use drugs to seek popularity and escape their rudderless lives. The two start as uneasy friends, then it is discovered that one's father killed the other, and the final confrontation is played out between Cooper and Gosling's son, set in the backdrop of the deep woods, far outside the city.Kudos to the screenwriters for keeping the story believable, and not shying away from the pathetic and essentially predetermined path of the characters' lives.",The Place Beyond the Pines
170,hkauteur,HK Auteur Review - The Place Beyond the Pines,8,19 August 2013,"A motorcycle stunt rider turns to robbing banks to provide for his lover and their newborn child. This decision puts him on a collision course with an ambitious rookie cop navigating a department ruled by a corrupt detective. The sweeping drama unfolds over fifteen years as the sins of the past haunt the present days lives of two high school boys wrestling with the legacy they've inherited.Ryan Gosling gives the silent minimalist performance as the motorcyclist Luke Glanton. It's slowly becoming to be his trademark, and justifiably so because he's great at it. Bradley Cooper appeared on Inside The Actor's Studio as a guest, where it was said he was the most promising acting talent of his graduating year at Pace University. Bradley Cooper is officially starting to show that talent now. It wasn't displayed in his previous projects. Dane DeHaan is a promising versatile talent. He really sells torture well. I look forward to seeing him as Harry Osbourne in the next The Amazing Spider-man movie. Ben Mendelsohn and Ray Liotta both sell slimy well. It's a good cast and they all deliver, but they all have accomplished similar roles in other past projects.The Place Beyond The Pines's core theme, due to the nature of the plot structure, will not be clear to the audience till the latter half. The story makes a shift and changes its central character. In that very moment, to really enjoy the film, the audience has to let go, take a step back and view the film on a larger canvas. Characters becomes archetypes and plot becomes saga. The sins of the father pass onto the son and we see the cause-and-effect echo from generation to generation.For me, I took that step back and all of a sudden I was pondering on bigger themes. Instead of thinking about bank robbers stealing money or police battling corruption, I thought about karma, the butterfly effect and the idea of violence perpetuating violence. At the final shot of the film, I was moved. It was a poignant, beautiful and poetic ending. I was impressed how the narrative touched me with its subtext by completely divorcing it with its supertext. This gambit the film plays on the audience is probably what will divide them. It doesn't help that the supertext of the film utilizes familiar genre conventions; at times it's a heist movie, other times it's a police corruption movie. That might throw some people off but that's what I loved about it. It was a bold narrative move and it was well played. Derek Cianfrance, well done!For more reviews, please visit my film blog at http://hkauteur.wordpress.com/",The Place Beyond the Pines
171,fathersonholygore,A film about what being a man truly means,10,5 May 2013,"I was very excited to see The Place Beyond The Pines for several reasons: I enjoy Derek Cianfrance's skills as a director from what I've seen so far, as well as being a fan of both Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper. What I got was a pleasant surprise; the film surpassed any expectations I had. I seemed to be preparing myself for what I thought might be a very artsy take on cops versus criminals, but I experienced what is certainly a true crime drama.Basically, I feel the story boils down to the widely encompassing theme of manhood. Luke is a man who lives on the fringe; when he discovers the existence of a son he fathered with a woman named Romina, he quits his job as a stunt bike driver in a circus act to begin robbing banks. This eventually puts him face to face with a new cop only on the streets for 6 months, Officer Avery Cross. We draw parallels between the lives of these two men after Cross shoots Luke. What seems to others as a simple standoff is actually the result of Cross firing first before giving Luke a chance to surrender; Avery decides not to tell it how it actually happened, and is celebrated as a hero cop. As opposed to Luke who willingly waited for police to arrive after braining Romina's new man with a wrench, Avery is an ultimate hypocrite. Where as Luke takes responsibility for his actions, Avery does not, and it haunts him for the rest of his life. Even when he turns in his corrupt cop buddies, he uses it to further a political career starting in the D.A's office. 15 years later, we come to know Avery's son who is now in high school, and he befriends another young man his age named Jason. The two are soon caught after purchasing ecstasy, and end up in jail. Avery has his son cut loose, and arranges a deal for the other boy; we soon learn Jason is the same little baby Luke once was trying to provide for. Avery's life now becomes wrapped up in the past, and in Luke. Soon enough, Jason learns the truth about how his father died. Avery and his son are planted firmly in cross hairs that the former created by never taking any responsibility for killing Luke, but fortunately for them Jason is not like them; Jason takes after his father. In a moment where he could have gunned Avery down, he chooses to run off, and as the film closes we see him buying a motorcycle from an older gentleman. The final shots are of Jason, as he drives off into the horizon to find himself, and maybe some piece of his father. My reason for focusing on the theme of manhood is because we watch two different fathers, and the outcome of their decisions. Luke is supposed to be the ""bad"" father on the wrong side of the law, robbing banks, but in the end it is his son who has turned out with the most integrity, and intelligence of the two. Avery's son is a spoiled rich kid who talks like he wants to be a gangster, does drugs, and general engages in any type of behaviour that his father's lifestyle condemns. Without aiming to or preaching its message, The Place Beyond The Pines examines how people from different sides of the tracks are misunderstood, and how being a man is more than your profession; being a man requires heart, and it requires taking your blows when they're deserved, which is something Avery Cross never learns except possibly at the end.Amazing film. The cinematography was spectacular, the performances were high energy, and I loved the writing. A very close character study of two men, and what it means to be a man. Absolutely 10 out of 10 stars, and I highly recommend everyone sees this film.Post edit: I've heard many people gripe about how they don't think everyone looks aged appropriately after the '15 Years Later' jump partway through The Place Beyond The Pines. I say I can't agree. In particular, during a court scene with the young Jason, we see Eva Mendes now 15 years down the road from her earlier self; if you look at her, she has aged quite clearly in the film in appearance, and simply the way she holds herself. Also, Robert Clohessy has very notably aged when we see his character again with Bradley Cooper. Overall, Cooper himself looks appropriate for a man aged 15 years since the beginning of the film; during the start, I remember finding it incredible how baby faced he looked, and nearing the end of the film, Cooper looks much more mature, much more like a man of his profession would. The biggest complain I've heard is that Ben Mendelsohn looks very similar to how he did at the beginning of the film. What people need to remember is that between the ages of 40 and early 50s, not everybody goes through significant changes in their appearance. Compare both Mendelsohn and Clohessy- the latter is almost a decade older, and so when we see him the second time 15 years on in the film, he has clearly gotten more grey, he wears big almost Coke bottle-like glasses, but Mendelsohn appears to still be raggedy the way he always was, just still holding on to whatever physical youth he has left. I don't think it takes anything away from the film, as it feels to me like they did a good job on this.",The Place Beyond the Pines

174,warthogjump,Brilliant effort!,8,13 May 2013,"The place beyond the pines was a bold and magnificent effort by filmmaker Derek Cianfrance.The movie is set with three major acts. The first focuses on Ryan Gosling, a motorcycle stunt rider who turns to robbing banks to support his new born child. This first act was executed with excellence. Gosling's character is a joy to watch, the soundtrack is phenomenally executed and the cinematography is so beautiful, not to mention Gosling's partner in crime also manages to give an outstanding performance.The second act focuses on Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper), a rookie cop trying to move up the ranks with a family of his own. The second act was also executed with utter brilliance. Cooper's acting was beyond brilliant, his best yet in my opinion (including his recent Silver Linings Playbook). Cooper deserves to be rewarded for his beyond excellent portrayal of a good cop merely trying to fulfill his duties in a corrupt police department trying to profit from proceeds of crime. Cooper's conflict with the corrupt detective (Ray Liotta) is tension filled and a joy to watch.The third act focuses on the son's of both Cooper and Gosling, who have both grown up to become teenagers. This is by far the weakest act in the movie in my opinion. Although I would rate this act as ""good"" of itself, it simply felt like it detracted from the overall viewing experience of the phenomenal first two acts. Although it seems the overarching purpose of the movie was to demonstrate the impact fatherhood (or lack of) has on kids, I felt that this last act was simply unnecessary.The place beyond the pines was set to be an exceptional experience with the first two acts if it was tied up there, but the attempt to install the third act went too far. The attempt to demonstrate the impact fatherhood (or lack of) has on kids felt too rushed for it to have sufficient impact on me. The first two acts of themselves were extraordinary and the movie should have been left there! It didn't need to be stretched out to achieve some extended purpose sought out by the director.Nevertheless, what we have are two excellent acts and one good one, which, in my opinion, would equate the movie to a ""very good"" viewing experience (as opposed to ""excellent"", ""extraordinary"" or ""top of the range"").In my final opinion, I would highly recommend this movie for the first two acts alone.PS I might also add that the introduction of Cooper's cop character Avery has to be one of the best introductions ever! It was so subtle and realistic. I loved it!",The Place Beyond the Pines
175,DubhDoo,"Bold, beautiful and often brilliant",8,20 April 2013,"In 2010, Derek Cianfrance emerged with a superb film called 'Blue Valentine'. Starring Ryan Gosling (who also appears in 'Pines') and Michelle Williams, it was one of the most unsentimental films about love in a long time. The film not only saw Gosling and Williams at the top of their game, but also marked Cianfrance as a director to watch out for and after three years, he has followed it up with the generation- spanning 'The Place Beyond the Pines', a film that explores the notion of the sins of the fathers being passed onto their sons. Like 'Blue Valentine' it has an interestingly-shaped narrative, but in contrast to the non-linear story of the former, 'Pines' is essentially three short stories attached through characters and actions. In the first story, Ryan Gosling plays Luke Glanton, a stunt rider for a travelling circus who, after a cage of death performance in upstate New York, is told by a woman named Romina (Eva Mendes) that he is the father to her child. He then teams up with a local garage owner (a terrific Ben Mendelsohn) and turns to robbing banks to provide for his family. In the second story, Bradley Cooper plays Avery Cross, a young police officer, injured in action and hailed as a hero, only to discover corruption in the force once he returns. Then, the third story, set 15 years later, is concerned with Luke and Avery's sons (played by Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen, respectively) and the effects the sins of their fathers have had on them.A film which changes main characters three times over and carries out a 15 year jump at the end of its second act could easily end up feeling uneven and formless, but in Cianfrance's skillful hands, we never really feel as if we are watching a different film in each story, because they tie together excellently in a way that flows seamlessly, being adjoined by overarching themes and recurring motifs. Luke, introduced in an extraordinary opening shot, burns through the screen with Gosling's red-hot intensity, in what is one of the actor's best performances yet, rivalling his turn in his previous collaboration with Cianfrance. All bleached blonde hair, tattoos and worn-out clothes, he is a world away from Bradley Cooper's Avery, who comes from a middle- class and respectable background. Yet, they are only different superficially, as when it boils down to it, they are just as bad and sinful as each other. It helps that 'Pines' sees Cooper deliver his best and nuanced performance thus far, continuing on the talent he showed in 'Silver Linings Playbook'. Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen are also very impressive in their roles, being naturalistic and engaging as they take over the film's final act.'The Place Beyond the Pines' is a very strong and bold film with moments of true greatness, especially in the film's first story, which feels akin to some cinematic dream, due to the flawlessness of it. It also bares a vague resemblance to the early work of Terrence Malick, primarily with its expansive rural landscapes and a nice touch where Mendelsohn chases some ducks, soundtracked by a conversation. With great performances all round, beautiful 35mm-filmed cinematography by Sean Bobbitt and a superb score by Faith No More's Mike Patton, this excellent film confirms Cianfrance as a true talent who will deliver a masterpiece.",The Place Beyond the Pines

Left me pining for a shorter film.,5,18 January 2014,"Luke Glanton (Ryan Gosling) is a stunt motorcycle rider in a carnival, who has a one night stand with Romina, (Eva Mendes) which results in a son, named Jason. (Anthony Pizza, Dane DeHaan) Romina has moved on, she's seeing another man, named Kofi. (Mahershala Ali) Luke still feels a sense of responsibility to support his son, monetarily. He quits the carnival, and meets a man named Robin, (Ben Mendelsohn) who convinces Luke to be a bank robber. Luke would steal the cash, and drive his motorcycle to Robin's awaiting truck. They knock over a few banks, and Robin wants to call it quits, but Luke keeps going, by himself. Soon Robin is tracked down and shot by a rookie cop named Avery (Bradley Cooper) who also has a one year old son named A.J (Travis Jackson Campbell,Emory Cohen) What effect does Luke's shooting have on Avery, Jason, and A.J.? I liked the beginning of this story, but soon it loses the intensity and focus of the story. The scope of the story is too sweeping, not only does it cover one generation, but two. And by the time the second generation rolls around, the intensity fades away. This movie tries too hard to be East of Eden, but Derek Cianfrace is not John Steinbeck, although I did like Blue Valentine. And if this is what kids are like in the next generation, taking oxycontin by the fistful and washing it down with booze, I weep for future generations. There are too many coincidences in the script tying one generation to the next, beginning with the fact that both criminal and cop have one year old sons, and there is a wholly unnecessary subplot about police corruption and overall the movie is too long.The acting is really good, at least by the older generation. Ryan Gosling gives his patented laconic, intense, loner performance, and this time it works, unlike Only God Forgives and the Gangster Squad. Bradley Cooper gives a mostly good performance, with some lackadaisical scenes tucked in-between. Eva Mendes is good, despite some awful makeup to make her appear older, but the younger actors, Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen cannot match the intensity of their elders. They have the elocution of bad rappers, and most of all, they really can't act.The direction is very good especially the scenes involving the motorcycle, but an overly long, complicated script derail what could have been a really good movie.For movie reviews that can tell the forest from the trees, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",The Place Beyond the Pines
178,georgep53,"Gosling & Cooper Shine In ""Place Beyond the Pines""",9,19 April 2013,"Derek Cianfrance's new film is a terrifically humanistic experience that's welcome relief from the usual Hollywood nonsense, an epic that captures a fallen world and the overarching power of destiny. Cianfrance's tale unfolds in 3 parts: Luke Glanton's story; Avery Cross's story and the story of the succeeding generation. Luke is a loner who makes a living as a daredevil motorcyclist in carnival shows. Gosling gives a riveting performance as Luke, a man on a mission to embrace paternity over what has heretofore been the fiercely independent narrative of his life. Bradley Cooper is excellent as Avery, a lawyer who works as a dedicated law enforcement officer on the Schenectady police dept. Emory Cohen and Dane DeHaan are convincing as A J and Jason, the sons of Avery and Luke. Cohen is the angry young man bitter about living in the shadow of his ""hero"" father, a man who has never taken the time to really know him. DeHaan hasn't known the advantages of A J and has no idea who he is. Eva Mendes gives a grittily realistic performance as a waitress and Luke's former girlfriend.""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is the city of Schenectady and like the rest of contemporary America it has seen better days and now is forced to cope with economic doldrums and corruption. Cianfrance isn't afraid to paint with big, bold strokes that pack an emotional punch. This film should satisfy serious filmgoers and leave you with plenty to think about after the final shot.",The Place Beyond the Pines

181,matty_mushroom1983,Intense and shattering,8,1 October 2018,"There are 3 things I love about Ryan Gosling.
Obviously he's an incredibly attractive guy, and even for me as a heterosexual male he's effective in that respect. There's also the soul capturing performances he naturally delivers and my statistical experience with his films weighing heavily in his favour.A stunt cycling a discovers he's an illegitimate father. He turns to robbing banks in a hasty attempt to greatly provide for his son. Needless to say it goes pearshaped right around the time things stop working it for him and he stuffs it up, gets shot in a legal altercation.
The cop that kills him goes on to excise corruption in the police force and succeeds in his career, but his career comes at the cost of a secure family for him.
All the while he never forgets the son of the man he killer in the line of duty. Of course, the son is never told of his father's dark past so when he finds out during his angst laden adolescence, shit turns sour and he does some bad things.The moral of the story is left to interpretation and isn't really grounded in one specific lesson, but throughout the film the viewer can find themself wishing they could intervene, show support and bring clarity to a life situation the characters, the confusion and muddy perception of which all these characters are suffering. What I take away from this film is another example of the powers of truth, integrity and honesty, and the consequences of the contrary to these qualities.Powerful film, I hope to see more from those involved in its making",The Place Beyond the Pines

183,octopusluke,"A mix of Scorsese, Malick & Nuri Bilge Ceylan, THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES is an ambitious, but uneven drama.",5,10 April 2013,"www.theframeloop.comFollowing 2010's chamber love(loss) drama Blue Valentine, filmmaker Derek Cianfrance returns in more virtuosic style with The Place Beyond the Pines.Don't let the tomfoolery of gross mis-marketing fool you. Despite the somewhat frenzied trailers and occasional heist-turned-motorcycle chases, Cianfrance's latest is just as hermetic and character driven as his last. Wrestling with themes of familial disconnect and moral ineptitude, the exhausting 140 minute running time swims around all of these ideas without ever attacking them head-on. Nurture vs. nature, it bears some mercurial resemblance to Terrence Malick's recent The Tree of Life, only this time with a few more drugs and a few less dinosaurs.It kicks off with Ryan Gosling as Luke, a nomadic motorcycle stunt rider in a travelling carnival show. Finishing up one night of dizzying feats, he stumbles into former lover Romina (Eva Mendes), who drops a colossal bombshell telling him that, after one night of passion a year ago, he now has a son. Stunned, the capricious Luke quits the stunt game and uses his 'motobandit' skills to pull a series of bank robberies.Following 45 minutes of masterful crime-drama storytelling, Cianfrance segues into a phlegmatic middle chapter when we're introduced to law-school graduate turned ambitious police officer Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper). The law enforcer is quickly on our antihero's tail, while the venal police department he works for wait for him surreptitiously in the wings. The third, redemptive instalment to the story looks at the fatal impact and legacy that the two hunks' confrontation has had on the present day, and the prism of deceit, corruption and hidden truths that continue to whistle through the trees of Schenectady New York, aka 'the place beyond the pines'.Just as in Blue Valentine, Cianfrance proves himself to be a quintessential 'actor's director', coalescing with his cast to create a handful of career-best performances. Striking gold twice with Canadian heartthrob Gosling, whom is so entrenched in the intricacies of his character's architecture that the results are quite literally worn on his sleeve and the meticulous, self- designed tattoos. His portrayal of Luke is so enigmatic and alluring that it will distractingly remind you of his turn in Nicholas Winding Refn's 2011 Drive, a superior, but equally cryptic movie.While her screen-time is limited, Eva Mendes impresses in a testing, warts-and-all performance as the forlorn lover/mother Romina. In a film so emotionally opaque, she resonates as the bare, beating heart of the film. The biggest thespian accolade has to go to Bradley Cooper as the centrepiece player of the story. Unlike the smouldering Gosling, the Silver Linings Playbook star uses deafening silence to present his character's complexity and moral dilemma, rather than cloak it. Two great films in a row, it's a shame he will next be gracing multiplex cinemas with the turgid end to The Hangover trilogy, as he certainly has an indisputable dramatic aptitude.The support are also on top form, most notably Australian sideliner Ben Mendelsohn as a grimy mechanic looking for a quick buck, and the inexplicably menacing, young hopeful Dane DeHaan, whose character we meet in the lacklustre final story. In fact, the only entirely redundant on-screen performance comes from Ray Liotta, phoning it in with the same bad guy mobster shtick we have seen from him countless times before, and really have no desire to see again.Director of photography Sean Bobbitt (who dazzled previously working on Steve McQueen's Shame and Hunger) brings more fervour to the picture with cinematography that is plush when it needs to be, and claustrophobic during the more intense narrative moments. Sonically, Faith No More/Ipecac Records nut Mike Patton puts in a similarly frantic score to some success but, like some of his musical endeavours, is prone to being aggressively distracting.Cianfrance's ambition is admirable, and he certainly has an idiosyncratic style that nestles in somewhere between early day Scorsese, Terrence Malick and Nuri Bilge Ceylan. Unfortunately, nothing here holds together long enough to be a consistently involving movie. For every great cinematic moment, there's two steps back, with croaky script beats and what appears to be a complete lack of post-production editing prowess. Overpacked and exhausting, The Place Beyond the Pines is certainly a place worth visiting, but it's not the accomplished masterpiece it deserved to be.More reviews, interviews and other things at The Frame Loop: www.theframeloop.com",The Place Beyond the Pines

187,PopCulturedwithMovieMike,An interesting tale of fatherhood.,9,29 January 2014,"""If you ride like lightning, you're going to crash like thunder."" The Place Beyond the Pines is one of my most anticipated films of the year. It's directed by Derek Cianfrance, who also directed the gut- wrenchingly visceral Blue Valentine. Pines also stars Ryan Gosling, one of my favorite actors and Bradley Cooper, coming off a career defining (and Oscar nominated) performance in Silver Linings Playbook. Pines is structurally unlike most films. This might put off some people who are used to more linear storytelling, but I really loved how the story unfolded. For those that don't know, Pines is broken up into 3 acts. The first act follows Luke, played by Ryan Gosling, who drives a motorcycle in a traveling carnival. The second act deals with Avery, played by Cooper, who's a police officer that crosses paths with Luke and ends up getting caught up in a world of crooked cops. The third act transports us 15 years in the future and revolves around the two sons of Luke and Avery. While I enjoyed the film as a whole, it's the first act that really shines. I could have watched a full length film just about the first act. Gosling's character is so mesmerizing, you can't take your eyes off of him. Luke is a legend. As he slowly makes his way through the crowded carnival grounds, time seems to stop. Everybody is there to see him. As he enters the spherical metal cage and begins to ride his motorcycle in circles with two other riders at break-neck speeds, he seems almost mythical. Like a James Dean or a Kurt Cobain, Luke seems like one of those rare souls that is destined to walk this Earth for only a short time. There's no old man in a rocking chair in their future. Their star is too bright, their energy too hard to contain. With a cigarette dangling precariously from his lips and tattoos scattered throughout his body, including one on his face, Gosling resembles a more dangerous James Dean. A real rebel without a cause, except this rebel actually has a cause and it's to support his newborn son. A son that he only just recently realized he had. In order to do this, Luke quits the carnival and starts robbing banks. This is just one of the themes that Pines touches upon - fathers and sons. Pines also asks the question of whether or not a son must pay for the sins of the father. Are we doomed to repeat the errors of our father regardless of whether or not the aforementioned father is even present in our lives? Is our future already predetermined by our genes, or can they truly be changed by our actions? Pines also shows how lives can be intertwined and how the future of individuals can be affected by the choices we make. The second act of the film focuses on Cooper's character. This part of the film can't help but come down from the kinetic high that was the first act. Cooper seems subdued especially coming off of his powerhouse performance in Silver Lining Playbook. That being said, it makes sense that Avery is more quiet and reserved. He's caught in the middle and haunted by his decisions. The second act is a really important part of the film and deals with greed, guilt and corruption. It also helps set up the rest of the film and in doing so, the lives of the two sons of the main characters. The third act may seem out of place with the rest of the film, but it's carried by two great performance by two actors who aren't yet household names. First is Luke's son Jason, played by Dane DeHaan (Chronicle), a true star on the rise. Jason is a quiet outcast who, on the surface, doesn't seem to have the magnetic gravitational pull of his father. Second is Avery's son AJ, played by Emory Cohen. AJ is a wannabe thug that desperately wants to distance himself from his father's squeaky clean image. Without giving too much away, I will say that both characters don't turn out like you would expect. A lot of people are complaining that the film is too long (like this review), but it never felt like that to me. I thought the pacing was very good and I never felt there were wasted scenes. Every scene moved the story forward. Some might also take issue with the way the stories weave together, but I thought it felt natural. I can also say that Pines has a poignant and satisfying ending. The Place Beyond the Pines is a character study piece that has a very realistic feel. It's one of the things I love about Cianfrance's filmmaking. It feels natural and genuine, like a slice of life. It's Once Upon a Time in America for the 20th century.",The Place Beyond the Pines
188,jchano123,"Interesting, but could have been better",6,30 November 2017,"When I first looked into this I thought it would be some boring melodramatic indie film, but thankfully I was wrong. This movie was definitely consistently interesting and by no means boring, but had the story been told in a different order, and not simply chronological, it could've been a lot better. The direction was really good and filled with lots of tension and the story as a whole was pretty interesting.Gosling sold his part for me even though I'm really not the biggest fan of his, but I really hated the character and liked seeing him lose so many times. I actually ended up not liking any of the four male lead characters in this. Cooper's was stupid and didn't earn my respect from the get go, and Cohen's really annoyed me. DeHaan's was probably the most likable, but even then, not much.Technically, almost all the camera-work was hand-held which got dizzying and many shots could have been significantly more effective if a track or dolly was used.In the end, it was an interesting movie, but could have been much better had there not been so many missed opportunities.",The Place Beyond the Pines
189,littleging12,One of the Most Underrated Movies of All Time,9,9 January 2017,"""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is the second feature film with the director/actor pair of Derek Cianfrance and Ryan Gosling. The two together are a two man wrecking force who show resemblance of a DiCaprio/Scorsese dynamic. In this film, they tackle an ambitious, emotional and completely original tale about fathers and sons, sins of the father, generational consequences, and how one moment can send shockwaves lasting a lifetime.The movie is broken into three acts, each as compelling and unpredictable as the one before it. The film centers around three main characters, somehow, all connected to each other. It stars Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper and Dane DeHann as the leads. Ryan Gosling channels the brooding reticence of his unnamed badass from ""Drive"" and the cool swagger of Tyler Durden from ""Fight Club."" Bradley Cooper displays a lot of versatility as he plays a nervy rookie cop. Some other actors who shine here are Ben Mendelsohn, Mahershala Ali, Bruce Greenwood, and Ray Liotta (with his signature menacing intensity). The actors really own their roles and allow for the viewers to connect with the portrayal of their sympathetic characters. The only problem here is that the newcomer actors (Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen) don't carry their act as effectively and emotionally as Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper did.The story here is ambitious and succeeds in telling a new and refreshing tale that filmgoers have not seen or experienced on this level of deep sophistication in ages. The film transcends movie tropes and plots as it takes a realistic, gritty, and life-like spin on traditional storytelling. ""Pines"" is more than just a movie. It is an exploration and examination of the human experience, spirit, and conscience.To match the film's sensational storytelling and acting is the phenomenal directing, cinematography, and music. Everything about the filmmaking craft helps enhance the emotional impact, and real life gravity of the film. It isn't just some action crowd pleaser or CGI-infested cash grab. Nor is it some black and white 'good guys vs bad guys' rehashed plot Hollywood has been spewing out for the last quarter-century. It's an emotional, heart- wrenching, and enriching drama in which you see every character as a human person capable of love, forgiveness, and sinful actions. It is a powerhouse of craftsmanship. Director Derek Cianfrance expertly weaves together a complex and emotionally draining epic that puts an emphasis on how one moment/decision can affect generations to come. He also concocts immersive third-person POV tracking shots which greatly add to the occasional thrills of the film. The cinematography and music create a hurricane of emotions to further augment the viewing experience.It is a travesty that ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" has not gotten the attention it deserves. It's mandatory viewing for any film buff or life enthusiast. Because what this movie is is life on screen.",The Place Beyond the Pines

191,mistabobdobolina,Don't understand why this film polarizes reviewers so much.,7,20 August 2013,"It's a solid film with an interesting, well-worked-out structure, consistently good performances and some quite interesting things to say about the impact of our decisions on subsequent generations.Chapter One, the story of Ryan Gosling's character Luke Glanton -- a carny who goes by the name of ""Handsome Luke"" and starts out leading an empty existence as a circus stunt rider -- functions as almost a deconstruction of the kind of protagonist he played in *Drive.* His character is the outcome of a life built around turning oneself into a set of macho clichés. The final arc of what is plainly already a tragic life begins when a former lover (Eva Mendes) turns up at one of his gigs in an attempt to reconnect with him that she clearly reconsiders after a few minutes' further exposure to him. Intrigued by all the pregnant pauses in their encounter, he seeks her out again and discovers she's had his son... a realization that derails him by offering a tantalizing glimpse of a possible path toward some kind of settled life, fatherhood and maybe some sort of pseudo-respectability. Trouble is, he doesn't have the skill set he needs to make family-raising money, and is increasingly tormented as he watches his ""rightful"" place as a father being filled by a decent guy who a) clearly has his sh*t together and b) is not him. Cue the turn into bank robbing that in short order leads to his death.Gosling's performance -- as a man who has belatedly realized how pathetically hollow are the clichés he's built his life around -- is excellent. So is the direction, which eschews any temptation to turn this into the thrilling actioner some viewers clearly expected in favour of vividly demonstrating the queasy, terrifying awfulness of Luke Glanton's detour into criminality. Hardest to watch are Glanton's attempts to interact with his ""family,"" who -- barring some residues of affection (or pity) from his former girl Romena -- clearly just want him to go away. He even disastrously messes up his final moments when he begs Romena not to tell his son about him... extracting an oath which proves to have dark consequences.Chapter Two overlaps with the first in Glanton's final robbery, where rookie cop Avery is slyly introduced as just one in a horde of black-and-whites on the robber's tail. Avery wins ""hero"" status by killing Luke, but it's quickly established that his world -- infested with dirty cops and political maneuvering -- is no more ""heroic"" than Glanton's was. Avery himself is desperately trying to inhabit the ""hero cop"" role, and upbraids his wife when she tries to talk him into quitting (understandably in a way -- what exactly made her think that police work would never involve physical risk?), but in the end is forced into some ruthless political maneuvering of his own to save his own life and self-respect.The ""Faustian bargain"" nature of his final solution is clear: in a way he becomes a man who has to choose which part of his soul to amputate in order to get ahead, and the scene where he makes his choice is both compelling and fairly chilling. There is also some interesting echoes of Luke Glanton's story in his -- the queasy terror of discovering he's a man alone in a corrupt department is reminiscent of the bank-robbery sequences; his attempts to interact with and make some recompense to Romena are as wrenchingly painful in their delusion as Luke's had been. And the distance it all puts between him and his own son, who he admits having trouble looking at since killing Luke, has a predictable outcome.Chapter Three, fifteen years later, introduces us to an ambitious and successful Avery who's operating at a different social bracket than Luke in the opener but is just as hollow. It also introduces his dysfunctional offspring, A.J., a slick kid with a fake Long Island accent trying to drown his sense of rejection in drugs (in an underrated performance by Emory Cohen); and to a messed-up Jason, Luke's son, whose nagging questions about his biological father -- whom his mother and hence his stepfather are self-forbidden to speak about -- form a suppurating wound at the core of what could otherwise have been a reasonably contented life.The tableau of teen dysfunction and inevitable collision of family pasts that ensues could have been predictable... but actually isn't. At any rate it kept me guessing up until the resolution. And if the film's final message -- that the ""place beyond the pines"" is one of healing and reconciliation -- is a bit treacly, it's far preferable to the much more nihilistic directions such a story could easily have been taken.",The Place Beyond the Pines
192,Toph-22,Intense and intoxicating,9,21 September 2019,"'The place beyond the pines' is one of my favorite movies. My first contact with the director Derek Cianfrance.

Just the opening scene, which accompanies the main character from his RV to his work place, tunes the viewer to the mood of the entire movie. 10/10In the second episode Bradley Cooper is the focus.

The reply was that she wanted to see the end, despite the film.At almost two and a half hours the boredom is almost terminal: I am happy to sit through a movie that engages me, is well made and acted and isn't merely a vehicle for expensive car crashes but even if cut by an hour this would only just keep me in my seat.I cannot, a week later, remember anything about the movie, which has to say a lot about how I review it. Correction - I do remember the two or three aerial shots following cars and a bike along treelined roads and do recall wondering how they were done: drones or steadicam gantries? And why, just why, were they left in? To make cine geeks like me wonder how? Excellent acting all round, but spoiled by being too long, and - as usual nowadays - full of hand-held sequences for absolutely no valid reason except that it's the modern cliché. And not merely hand-held with some jiggling about for so-called dramatic effect - many were only just detectable as not being shot on a dolly.

195,varuna12,Its a complete film!,9,15 December 2017,"'The Place Beyond The Pines'
This 2012 film is one of the best films ever. Totally cinematic with characters to love and die for, its a roller coaster ride of emotions and my favourite 'stay'. I love the 'slow' pace of it and the characters taking their time to react. They don't just say the lines, the become the characters.
Maybe I am sadist but this was just my type of a slow and hyper-emotional films where the characters are fighting with inner conflicts. In fact every single character is fighting his own battle.'Luke''s life takes a turn when he finds out he has a baby he didn't know about. He choses to swap his life of somewhat fame and easy money and carelessness for an opportunity to be with his son and the mother of his son who is now with another man. His guilt of not being their for his mother takes precedence. As a result he chose a life of crime. To be his honest his character is somewhat unstable that loses the path of life and head for the wrong direction.
'Romina' the mother of the child too has a conflict, her's is about her duty as a mother towards his child for which she choses to be with another man, another 'stable' man and for a stable life for herself and her child; her conflict is that she might still be in love with Luke but for the sake of her child's life she decides not to be with Luke.'Avery' the cop is riddled with his own dilemma; he has his friends and colleagues on one side but on the other is his fight with his conscience which forces him to 'rat' these corrupt cops out. This is compounded by his every present guilt of killing 'Luke' by mistake. Even after years, Avery feels a sense of responsibility towards Romina and her child and tries to help them in whatever way he can.It is simply an amazing film with amazing performances. I would certainly reccomend it to anyone who loves cinema and storytelling. Amazing shot with a sense of melancholy and with lovely music this is a must watch film.
BTW this is the 2nd time I have watched it and I watched it cos I remembered how awesome it felt the first time I watched it.My ratings: 9/10 *********

His speciality involves riding his bike around a tight spherical cage, tricky enough on your own but he does it with two other riders criss-crossing him at high speeds!Constantly on the road, Luke flits in and out of life. A fling with Romina (Eva Mendes), in his home town of Schenectady, makes him reassess his priorities. Unbeknown to Luke who is away for long stretches of time, Romina had a baby son Jason by him. She's in a steady relationship with Kofi (Mahershala Ali), casting Luke aside upon his return. Finding out that Jason is his son, Luke is forced to leave his job as he wants to do the chivalrous thing and stay to raise his son and win back Romina.But bike-riding is all Luke knows, so money is difficult to come by. Car mechanic Robin (Ben Mendelsohn) offers him a bit of work, and knows a thing or two about robbing banks. Partners in crime they become, and ""Not since Hall and Oates has there been such a team"". Robin certainly knows where Luke is headed, who ""rides like lightning and crashes like thunder"". Cianfrance gambles on an unexpected plot-twist, when clean-cut rookie cop Avery (Bradley Cooper) is introduced and becomes the focus of the film. Under the shadow of his ex-judge father (Harris Yulin), law graduate Avery decides to join the police instead to fulfil his idealistic desire to serve for the law and justice. He soon becomes the poster boy for the police force for his role in an incident on the job, but the repercussions of this event leads Avery down a rocky path of police corruption and intimidation. With seemingly no way out, Avery's father aides his escape from the clutches of bad cop Deluca (Ray Liotta) and everyone else.15 years later, the final act of the film sees Jason (Dane DeHaan) as a teenager, who eventually learns of his fathers past after his mothers constant refusal to discuss him for so long. Avery is now a district attorney, in the midst of a political campaign, who has an obnoxiously bratty teenage son AJ (Emory Cohen). Suspension of disbelief enters new ground with a ridiculous coincidence which derails the whole film, ending with a story of revenge and redemption which undoes all the good work Cianfrance had created.'The Place Beyond The Pines' has a heavyweight cast and its most definitely a character piece, and everyone acts their parts with distinction. Nobody truly stood out though, the heavily tattooed Gosling at times seemed to be on autopilot, it was often difficult to watch him when you concentrated on all his tattoos! And why was he wearing his t-shirts inside out? Its a shame nobody had the balls to ask him, so it remains a mystery.'The Place Beyond The Pines' explores the sins of absent fathers, and their indirect roles in shaping their off-springs future. The boundaries between who is good and bad is blurred when you watch Luke and Avery, are their sons destined to follow in their footsteps regardless of how much or how little influence they had in their lives? There is always a ray of hope, as with Jasons relationship with the patient and dependable Kofi, but in the end Jason chooses to opt for the stupidity of youth and ignore the father who has always been there for him since he was born. This film promised a lot, and with some brilliant sequences delivered for half of a muscular but long film until Cianfrance eventually lost his nerve.",The Place Beyond the Pines
197,cncgjqbm,Must See,10,11 September 2021,"This film is incredible with such talented actors with Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, Eva Mendes, etc.... The storyline isn't confusing as I have read on reviews. Ryan Gosling takes responsibility after finding out he has a son, as men should do. Despite doing this by robbing banks it shows the viewers what a man would do when pushed into a corner.Who is the real headliner? Ryan Gosling, or Bradley Cooper? Eva Mendez is gorgeous as always and extremely talented in her role.A definitely must see!",The Place Beyond the Pines
198,TimMeade,Taut and Solid Thriller,8,3 June 2013,"Ryan Gosling is undoubtedly one of the most bankable actors in Hollywood at present.He gained much credibility in the 2011 art-house hit, Drive, playing a taciturn stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver on bank heists.There are close similarities in his most recent film, The Place Beyond the Pines, where he is a drifting and taciturn motorcycle stunt rider in a travelling fair.When the fair returns to the town of Altamont in New York State a year after its previous visit, Gosling's character, Luke Glanton, discovers he is now the father of a 3 month old son, the result of a casual affair. He quits his job to stick around and establish a relationship with the boy and his mother, Eva Mendes, who is now in a steady relationship with another man and is more than a little dubious about the benefit of Gosling hanging around.Glanton picks up some work with a crash repairer, the seedy Ben Mendelson, but his minimum wage is insufficient to provide the support he feels he needs to show to become an integral part of his son's life. Mendelson suggests they knock off some banks – he has past form – using his knowledge in staging a heist with Glanton's skill as a rider to make the necessary quick exit. All goes well, for them at least, until the two men have a falling out. Over-confident, Glanton attempts a robbery by himself which quickly goes wrong and fleeing the scene, Glanton finds himself in a desperate cat and mouse chase with the local Police.At this stage, rookie officer Avery Cross played by Bradley Cooper enters the film. And here there is such a game-changer that it's really not possible to divulge any further synopsis without giving away major strands of the film.Suffice to say, the movie takes on a completely unexpected turn of events and heads in a direction which I can imagine very few would see coming.This is a taut and solid thriller with excellent performances from the whole cast. A special mention to Ray Liotta in a cameo role as a corrupt police officer who exudes menace from every pore – helped by lighting and camera-work designed to highlight his malevolence. You feel uneasy every time he's on screen.The film's ultimate conclusion does rely on a coincidence – a big coincidence. But director Derek Cianfrance gets away with this by letting the audience into the secret from its outset, and doesn't string it out to try and invoke an unlikely twist. And coincidences happen. If they didn't, the Archduke Ferdinand would never have been shot and World War One might never have occurred.More dramas of this calibre please.",The Place Beyond the Pines

Director Derek Cianfrance, once again, comes stupendously with a depressing family crisis plot likewise his previous Blue Valentine. Ryan Gosling makes a stout performance as the motorcycle rider who is desperate to retain his family back. Bradley Cooper, as the cop, brilliantly brings his essence to show inner struggles regarding the events. Eva Mendes, Ben Mendelsohn, the two teen-kids also put their acting aptitude.

200,krazysoon,Excellent drama and great acting. 20 out of 10. spoilers but not to revealing,10,8 May 2013,The Place Behind The Pines is a movie I did not hear about until 1 or 2 weeks ago when a article stated that the movie used real customers for the bank robbery. Soon I watched the trailer and was intrigued by what I saw. The movie is tense and dramatic with excellent acting from the cast. The movie follows the lives of the main characters and how their actions affect those involved. The film starts off with Ryan Gosling who travels with a fair and performs motorcycle tricks. He runs into someone he had a fling with and learns he is a father. Instead of leaving he decides to stay to be a father to his son and eventually decides to rob a few banks. A little over a hour into the film Bradely Cooper is finally introduced as a rookie cop and has a brief encounter with Gosling. Now you move into the life of Bradly Cooper after an unfortunate set of events who tries to live a normal life after the encounter but soon finds himself dealing with corruption on the police force. I don't want to ruin anything between but after we witness Gosling and Coppers lifestyle the film fast forwards 15 years later. Oh and Cooper had a one year old boy as did Gosling. Now the teenagers are opposite of each other as you will see. The teens do not know about what took place between Gosling and Cooper but it is pretty predictable so I won't say anymore. If you don't read what the movie is about before watching it a little after an hour you may ask yourself where does the movie go from here? But you will enjoy it if you enjoy drama and great acting. It's a tragedy and has to be one of the best movies I seen this year. The final minutes may come as a sigh of relief for most and glad it went for a more positive approach.,The Place Beyond the Pines
201,Joseph_Gillis,Founders on the Catch-22 of Its Own Ambition,7,28 July 2015,"Father-son relationships of two families are compared and contrasted in the context of a crime which they both fall victim to.One thing you can't fault writer-director Derek Cianfrance for is ambition, and he certainly deserves an A for that, or even an A+, because he tackled a difficult subject in a novel way, probably more to avoid slipping into the pit of mawkishness and sentimentality, than for a desire to appeal to a broader base of crime movie fans. Laudable, indeed, but I think he has inevitably fallen victim to a particular movie kind of Catch-22: in order to make the subject more palatable, he's dressed it up in attractive crime movie 'wolf's clothing', and therefore muddied - and even compromised - his intent. Inevitably, also -and to meet both demands - he's employed a multi- character story which is just too contrived and contains far too many implausible situations and coincidences to explain the relationship, satisfactorily. In contrast, if he had tackled the subject more subtly,and plausibly, he was always going to turn his intended audience off. Particularly for a mainstream Hollywood movie.Catch-22; hoist by his own petard;fall between two stools. Whatever.Aside from its ambition - for which I stuck with it to the end, despite my huge reservations - I enjoyed it mostly for constituent elements, and in particular for the acting. Bradley Cooper - who plays the guilt-wracked rookie cop - is unfamiliar to me, but his performance above all in a scene with a psychiatrist is as good a piece of acting as you'll see anywhere. All done with his eyes, and face, and demeanour - which is what distinguishes the best screen actors; he's largely a slave to the script, otherwise, but this one scene is evidence enough that he's worth watching out for. And to prove how good that performance was, he more than held his own against notorious scene-stealer, Harris Yulin. Yulin - one of my very favourite character actors of the past 40 years - threatened to grab the film and take it home with him in his pocket, but Cooper - and quite right, too - was having none of it: and he proved it, especially, in a swimming-pool scene they shared. Ryan Gosling, who plays the bike-rider errant-father turned to crime - and who'd I expected to be the major focus of the film - is somebody that on the evidence of this and 'Drive' I remain unconvinced by: he's all about bleached-blond wistfulness, and mumbling - and now pecs and six-pack, apparently; I breathed an audible sigh of relief when the Cooper story took centre-stage.Dane DeHaan as Gosling's son reminded me of a young Leonardo di Caprio, and was quietly effective; I wouldn't be as dismissive of Cooper son Emory Cohen's performance as one reviewer - certainly not on the evidence of one performance: his annoying mannerisms might just be down to script requirements; Eva Mendes looked great in 'Holy Motors', but I've never been convinced by her as an actor; Ray Liotta seems irreversibly typecast, now, and here he just seemed to be 'phoning it in'. I'd contrast his performance with James Remar's in 'Fear X': he showed genuine breadth,there, and willingness to experiment, and to break free from movie-villain typecasting.Script and acting aside: The soundtrack was almost unbearably intrusive, at times, - particularly in scenes of approaching conflict which the composer seemed determined to forewarn us: a musical 'look out, behind you', as it were. Cinematography was top-notch: particularly impressive was the fatal chase scene, but close-ups were effectively used, also.Overall, the film was well made and well-intentioned, but maybe the director needs to hire an independent scriptwriter, or choose a subject which allows for a more subtle telling of a tale, or imparting of a message.",The Place Beyond the Pines
202,andy-933-696608,The Place Beyond The Pines,8,22 April 2013,"When a person makes a decision, good or bad there will always be consequences in relevance to those actions, regardless of the intentions. In viewing The Place Beyond The Pines, one quote was stuck in my mind through the duration of the film. As Luke Glanton (Gosling) tells his partner in crime, Robin (Ben Mendelson) that he wants to up the stakes on their bank robbing scheme, Robin criticizes his recklessness by saying, ""You ride like lightening Luke, your gonna crash like thunder."" As relevant as the metaphor might be to Luke's fierce and mythical motorcycle riding, it pertains to the conscious notion of the consequential actions human beings make in pursuit of their goals. The case of the film is relevant to the subject of fatherhood, as it pertains to not only to the actions of the fathers, but also the legacy they leave behind for their sons, regardless of where their ethical beliefs stand. In their previous collaborations with the 2010 film, Blue Valentine, director Derek Cianfrance and Ryan Goslig reunite to deliver an epic that carries the spirit of a story that goes beyond a typical crime drama, and escalates more towards the subject of inherited legacies and the universal curiosity of destiny. Undoubtedly drawing elements from The Godfather, The Place Beyond the Pines goes far in its direction s it creates a story with multiple, but linear narratives, never interchanging between the stories, and always remaining intact with the character's raw emotional depth. It is the 21st century's own Godfather, as the sins of the father are passed down to the sons, regardless of morality or even choice in that matter, letting fate define the legacies that will follow.The first portion of the film centers its focus on the attempts of a carnival stunt rider named Luke Glanton as he desperately tries to become a part of his child's life. In an effort to support his child along with the mother Romina (Eva Mendes), Luke performs a series of bank robberies long enough to throw a solid amount of money and even influential bonding with his son Jason and former lover. But moving through life as though it were as fast as his bike, there eventually comes the thundering moment where it all comes to a crash.With an untimely and rather tragic end in the film the narrative shifts to the focus of aspiring New York police officer, Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper). His newly achieved status as a hero in the line of duty grants him praise from fellow officers, buddy wise and more so corrupt that it pushes Cross into a corner of moral contradiction. His love and desire to support his wife (Byrne) and one year old son bring even greater fear in the resolution and the future consequences of his actions to establish order and eliminate corruption.Unfortunately, even good actions bring forth an unexpected barrage of consequences. After 15 years within his stance against police corruption, Cross finds even greater conflict in single handedly raising a chaotic child that indulges in drugs, reckless indifference, and the ignorant destruction of a young man named Jason (Dane DeHaan). Jason's own socially destructive nature is both familiar and even welcoming to AJ Cross (Emory Cohen), as they smoke marijuana and take oxycodone. The boy's bond is formed and eventually destroyed from the sins of their fathers. Regardless of whether a person is on the right or the wrong side of the law, those closest will always face some manner of consequential results. Cop, criminal, or any loving Father, they will always leave some remnant of their legacy for their children to inherit.Derek Cianfrance's directing capabilities transcend the routine standards of an epic within The Place Beyond the Pines. As his second feature film and collaboration with Ryan Gosling, Cianfrance delivers a film that ultimately challenges the questions around the true meaning of fatherhood, and also within the actions of the sons. Gosling, joined by a cast of actors that demonstrate often raw and authentic performances, The Place Beyond the Pines captures a unique emotional depth within not just the character development or even the questionable ethics of its cast, but it also uses the beauty and isolated forest areas of Schenectady New York to convey the longing desire for order and peaceful solitude that most people often forsake within the struggles of life. Along with this sense of tranquility within the pristine beauty of nature, Catholicism although briefly approached within the first half of the film shows some influence within the themes of the film, as Glanton kneels beside a church bench, never praying but tearfully acknowledging his guilt before the child he sees as forsaken. The film gives a spiritual feeling within the chaos that defines these characters, be it the hopes both fathers have in providing for their sons, or the result of their actions in a world where nature itself gives an unspoken feeling of divinity.",The Place Beyond the Pines
203,Dfschohr-532-549658,The Place Beyond The Pines Review,9,22 October 2013,"The situations that we put ourselves in and the actions that we make, always have consequences, whether good or bad. These actions and consequences ripple throughout our lives and affect the ones we love. Derek Cianfrance damn near masters this in his latest film The Place Beyond The Pines.Luke Glanton (Ryan Gosling) is a traveling motorcycle stuntman for the state fairs. While back in a small town in New York., Glanton is informed that he has a child with Romina (Eva Mendez), a women he had a one night stand with the last time the fair was traveling through. Glanton soon quits his job and stays too be a father to his son. Luke befriends a sleazy backwoods mechanic, Robin (Ben Mendelsohn). The two hatch up a plan to rob one of the local banks, things then make a hard right turn and Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper), a rookie patrol men, who also has a newborn, is thrust, into a world of police corruption. After a few events unfold the film jumps fifteen years later, with Luke's son Jason (Dane DeHaan) and Avery's son AJ (Emory Cohen) at the helm of the third act. Ryan Gosling is astonishing, he has never been more electrifying. Gosling commands the screen and your attention, you never want to look away, he's memorizing. Bradley Cooper gives another fine performance. I know I should write more about his acting choices, but there are no more words too describe it, then I did for Gosling. The two are two of Hollywood's leading men and their Milli-second of screen time together is one of the more intense scenes in the films. In the second act of the film, Ray Liotta makes a captivating appearance, as a crooked officer, and there is no one better to play that type of role then Liotta. Then when we reach the third act, thats when the film takes a massive hit, and doesn't pull its weight like its previous acts. Its primarily due to the acting skills of the two young actors, although Dane DeHaan is definitely gonna be a great up and coming actor, with a few good films under his belt already. There are also pieces of the last act that seemed a little forced, or even too coincidental.Overall, Derek Cianfrance has created a film that should be viewed and cherished by all. Just listening to the chilling score by Mike Patton, it brought me back to my childhood and the way I viewed my parents and idolized them. As I grew older I realized that my views are completely different from them and I need to branch out, explore the world, experiment and not be so sheltered. The Place Beyond The Pines runs a little long at one hundred and forty minutes, but when the ending credits roll and Bon Iver's The Wolves start playing, its all worth it. I give The Place Beyond The Pines a 9 out of 10.",The Place Beyond the Pines
204,wimgielenglas,No original second,2,30 March 2021,No idea about the high ratings since there is no original idea or situation to be found in the entire movie. It's a waste of some great actors.,The Place Beyond the Pines
205,SillyPuddy,Dog with different fleas,5,9 April 2014,I can't remember the last time I was this excited to see a film. Started off with so much promise and slowly built tension and momentum. Then it all fell apart for me. Ryan Gosling does his typical tough guy shtick which works for the first half hour. Bradley Cooper starts off strong but there doesn't seem much for him to do after his big shooting scene. The more he is on screen the less believable it is to me that he would be a cop. I do like how he handled the corruption but it left me with a lot of questions as well. Act 3 was just depressing and I became uninterested as it slowly dawned on me that this movie was a huge disappointment and basically going nowhere-slowly and painfully.,The Place Beyond the Pines
206,annette-87536,Ok but not sure what I just watched,6,28 October 2020,Great casting. Three great stories but the endings were boring. Such a let down! Especially the last one.

207,Abhinav009,Touching film. One of Ryan Gosling's finest performances..,8,8 January 2020,"A touching tale of what happens when the randomness of life brings together two very different individuals, who happen to be in the same stage of life as parents and providers to their babies and how life doesn't really follow the rules of ethics.Ryan Gosling as Handsome Luke was the life of the first half of the movie as the actor once again proved his acting is just as good as his stunning looks, if not better. One can feel his suffering as he struggles to adapt to a new life now that he is a father. It's like he is supposed to be something he was never prepared for in any sense, and yet he wants it so bad he is ready to do whatever it takes to become that something to someone.As life forces him to go down the dangerous path, he encounters a police situation and sensibly chooses to surrender, calling his wife and pleading her to not let their son know about his real father. But what unfolds thereafter is just sad and unfortunate.Avery Cross(Bradley Cooper) is visibly shaken from the incident and finds it difficult looking at his own son when he learns about Ryan's child. And as the years pass by, with his skilful opportunism, he rises to the top of the bureaucracy chain.And this is when life takes an unexpected turn as Ryan and Avery's sons meet and become drug buddies. AJ is a drug addict thanks to Avery's negligence and Jason is drawn into the drug game by him. Eventually, Jason learns about Avery's connection to his father and takes him to the middle of a forest at gunpoint. And when Avery breaks down into tears and apologises, Jason just chooses to walk away.The film ends with Jason riding off on a bike, free-willed biking just like his father, perhaps to get to feel more close to him.",The Place Beyond the Pines
208,italo505,Two thumbs up!!! Best movie of 2013 thus far!!,10,31 March 2013,"I have got to call it now: Ryan Goslyn deserves an Oscar nomination for his turn in The Place Beyond the Pines. No question about it. He's a daredevil that defies gravity in a traveling circus stunt and doesn't know he's got a child with Eva Mendes who's come to see his performance. Upon seeing him, she realizes what a mistake she's made and doesn't tell him of his son. This is the beginning of the incredible story that will unfold over the next 2 and a half hours of intense, deep and poignant drama from the same director that shot Ryan Goslyn in Blue Valentine. Watching Ryan transform into Luke, or ""The Heartthrob"" as his stage name and tattoo reads, you would never believe this is the same dude from The Notebook or Crazy Stupid Love. Something about the way he stares, something about the way he approaches his bike, something about his tattoos that tell a different aspect of his character without any words, something about the way he looks at his son that cannot possibly be written in the script but yet he nails it right from the first moments you see him on screen. There's a scene in which Luke follows Eva and her husband into a church where they're baptizing his son, Jason, and he breaks down in tears. Even though there's no dialogue, you know precisely what's going through his head and you see a transformation right before your eyes. It's almost excusable what he does next. Seeing that he can't support his child, Luke turns to robbing banks and fleeing the scenes as fast as a bullet on his Heartthrob bike that is his lucky charm and a character of its own. You almost wish he would make it. A third, a fourth, a fifth time. Pines has such a great script that is so well-layered and complex that it feels as if you're watching 3 dramas unfold: first there's Luke and his bank robberies, then there's Bradley Cooper's cop who stops Luke in his tracks, and much later in the film 2 characters destined to meet and crash. I won't go into much more detailed but I will say that The Place Beyond the Pines better be in people's minds come time to nominate actors and movies for every award show in town 'cause it certainly deserves recognition for acting, script and directing. Two thumbs up!!!",The Place Beyond the Pines
209,roger-pettit1,An excellent film,9,3 May 2013,"""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is an excellent film; indeed, it's one of the best I have seen for ages. It's essentially a movie that consists of three separate but interlocking stories that focus on two generations of two families, primarily father and son. Luke (Ryan Gosling) is an expert motorcyclist who entertains customers at funfairs. He becomes aware that he is the father of a child by his ex-girlfriend Romina (Eva Mendes), a waitress who has a new boyfriend and who has not told Luke about their young son. Armed with the news that he is a dad, Luke decides to go on a bank-robbing spree to get hold of the money he feels he needs to support his son and to become an active part of his life. As a result, he crosses swords with a police officer, Avery (Bradley Cooper). Their encounter has far-reaching consequences for both characters - and for their sons, whose lives become entangled when they are teenagers at school (some 15 years later). Things move on from there but it would be unfair to say more than that.""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is a beautifully written and acted, thoughtful and intelligent film. It is essentially a fable about ambition and about the difficulties that members of blue-collar families experience when trying to escape the limitations imposed on them by their background and their early lives. The cinematography is excellent, as is the soundtrack. Although coincidence plays an important part in the development of the plot of the film, it does so in a way that does not strain credulity (and that is not something that can be said about many films these days). ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is a superbly entertaining film that will live long in the memory. I cannot recommend it too highly. 9/10.",The Place Beyond the Pines

211,grantbullert,A Gripping Film About Fate and Influence,8,3 November 2018,"""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is a film that haunts and comforts at the same time. So much of our lives are defined by what we have experienced, but we can still choose how we respond to our past.-Analysis of Notable Works- *Writing/Directing: The way in which the film presents its message is gripping and will stick with the viewer for a long time. It demands to be mulled over for days after watching. The characters are so deeply affected by what they have experienced and who have been put in their lives. This is an important thing to think about for our lives. So much of who we are depends on what we have seen and been through. Director Derek Cianfrance strikes a very powerful chord in this film as he dissects what it means to have identity in life. The things that drive us may not always make sense, but they are there anyway. *Editing/Cinematography: The pacing is absolutely perfect. It feels slow, but in the best way. Every scene is meant to be fully digested and taken in. The world is presented to us in such a detailed way, we begin to care about the same things the characters in the film care about. Cinematographer Sean Bobbitt brings an honest quality to the film. The world is so narrow through the eye of the camera. We are shown the most important parts of the characters' lives, and that makes this film especially powerful and emotionally hard-hitting. *Dialogue/Acting: The interactions between characters is beautifully written and grounded in reality. The entire film feels as if it is a part of the viewer's history. We are drawn in and can easily understand what is happening in the lives of the characters. Ryan Gosling gives an incredible performance as a rugged motor bike stuntman. He is an out-of-place father who desperately wants to start life over. Bradley Cooper performs brilliantly as well. Dane DeHaan and Ben Mendelsohn add powerful performances. The film is well acted all around. *Music/Sound: The soundtrack is absolutely incredible, changing from completely haunting to calming and soothing. It has a wonderful way of making the viewer nostalgic about things in their own lives that relate to that of the characters. The emotions of the characters feel so real and are brought to new heights with the music. The sound design is brilliant and engaging. It adds so much to the film without drawing too much attention to itself. *Production Design/Special Effects: The world that Luke and the people involved with him inhabit feels totally authentic and as if it were a real thing that occurred. The costume design is stunning. The locations and sets are completely engrossing. The special effects work doesn't draw attention to itself. Overall everything is nearly flawless.*Conclusion: ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is a film that will not let the viewer forget it. It stays with the viewer for days and keeps popping back in every now and again. The film is absolutely hauntingly beautiful.",The Place Beyond the Pines
212,elevenangrymen,A Quiet Journey,9,8 September 2012,"Derek Cianfrance's The Place Beyond The Pines is a visual odyssey, if nothing else. It is also an intense character study of three people. And it's a good film.The story is of Luke, a motorcycle stuntman, who quits his job after he finds out that Romina, played by Eva Mendes, his ex-girlfriend was pregnant and had his child. The trouble is, she married another man. Luke is torn between his new found love for his son, and his inability to hold a steady job. So, to take care of his 'family' Luke begins to rob banks, along with his friend, excellently portrayed by Ben Mendelsohn. Of course, this puts him on a collision course with Bradley Cooper's idealistic cop.Not wishing to ruin the plot, I won't say anymore. When I first heard the plot, I was immediately struck by the similarities to another excellent Ryan Gosling movie, Drive. In that film, Gosling plays a stunt driver, who takes on a job to help his neighbor. However similar the plot may be, the two films are complete opposites. The Place Beyond The Pines is a character driven study of morality and legacy, while Drive is closer to the genre of an action film. However, the two films do have one more thing in common, they both showcase excellent Ryan Gosling performances.In this film, Gosling's would be father, doing what he thinks is best, is at times aggravating and intensely emotional. It's a great performance, and a tricky one to master. But Gosling gets it, and turns in one of his best performances. That's not to say the other performances aren't spectacular as well. Eva Mendes turns in some of her best work in years, playing a woman torn between her desire to be with Gosling, and to have a normal family life with her husband. Bradley Cooper turns in his best work yet, playing a cop torn between his want for justice and his powerful ambition. As mentioned above, Ben Mendelsohn turns in some great work as does Ray Liotta. Mention must go to newcomer Dane Dehaan, performing in some of the film's most gut-wrenching moments.Then of course there is the director. Derek Cianfrance's style is completely unique, and incredibly effective. He is one director to keep an eye on. The cinematography is excellent, especially during the opening shot, when the camera follows Gosling from his trailer, across a fairground, onto a motorcycle and into a giant ball where Gosling rides around. That's not to say the film doesn't have it's bad points. The version I saw sagged in the end, even though it was necessary to the ending, I still feel they could have trimmed it down. I felt myself and a couple other audience members getting a little restless near the end.Despite the overlong ending, the film itself was still a great experience. A quiet moving character drama, expansive in it's scope yet intensely personal at its core. At a Q and A at the end of the film, Cianfrance admitted that what he really felt the film was about, was legacy, and passing the torch from generation to generation. And I think he is right.",The Place Beyond the Pines
213,mpurvismattp,"The Place Beyond The Pines-A movie about decisions, acts and consequences of life.",8,13 March 2014,"This movie is very unique and really leaves you wondering where it will go as it's something that most films we see don't do very often. ""A Place Beyond The Pines"" ends some characters story and begins a new with the next for the most part succeeding in doing so. All the performances were very well done in my opinion and this film required that (especially from the leads) to be affective, mainly because we latch onto a new lead character at the halfway point of the film. It's a tale of situations we don't want to be in, consequences we must deal with (whether seen or unseen) and the actions that lead us there. In many ways it's similar to a movie like ""Crash"" where you have multiple characters affecting each others lives along with the guilt, the shame, the anger or revenge and maybe the redemption or the forgiveness we all hope will come from it. Unlike ""Crash"" it's more of a half, half story following two families from different sides of the tracks but showing the similarities and the domino affect that will tragically bring them together inu a ballet of karma and coincidence. ""A Place Beyond The Pines"" may not be for everyone. It starts off as an action packed thrill ride and ends in a very different place then you might expect. If you give it a shot you may find it an interesting and thought provoking film with something to say. I did.",The Place Beyond the Pines
214,he_who_leads,Pine = Fresh,8,10 June 2013,"As soon as I saw the trailer for 'The Place Beyond the Pines', I knew I wanted to see it. It looked like a sweeping, muscular, foreboding thriller. The arty kind rather than the cheap Hollywood kind with cheesy one liners. The film delivers on this promise. It's moving, visionary and extremely suspenseful. Unfortunately, it loses its focus in the final third but it's still definitely worth watching. Circus performer Luke (Ryan Gosling) finds out he has a son with fling Romina (Eva Mendes). In order to step up and provide for his family, he turns to crime. His actions have repercussions which echo for many years to come. If we were to divide the film into three chapters, the first chapter belongs to Ryan Gosling. The strong, silent type, covered in ink, whose emotions rise to the surface when he finds out he has a son. Gosling trying to repair the mistakes of the past succeeds in involving us in the story emotionally. The struggle for grace and redemption in the face of grim circumstances and practicality sets the tone for the movie, and the bursts of choral music and cinematography are very effective. The middle act belongs to Bradley Cooper, as a cop, Avery, who becomes involved in Luke's criminal exploits. The middle is my favourite part of the movie. The plot thickens and the suspense level is extremely high. Ray Liotta is very memorable, sleazing his way under our skin. Both Luke and Avery, respectively, find the waters choppy and unforgiving as they try and navigate by their internal moral compass. Luke thinks crime is the answer, while Avery learns politics has to be played. Up until the movie's final chapter, director, Derek Cianfrance, has done a great job in crafting a tale of high drama and consequences. A criticism would be that his storytelling style can feel claustrophobic. Like following the thread of an overly-linear choose-your-own-adventure tale, where a sense of context is lost. The final third jumps forward in time. It's not necessarily bad – in fact it's still interesting, but it could have been a lot better. The choice to shunt to the side so many of the established characters makes the film lose momentum, so in the moments where they are on screen, its hard to connect with them. There's a feeling of too much unresolved business, not helped by the film peaking in the middle. However, there's no denying the film's vision and power. I was still left shaken and slightly breathless, feeling that I had been taken on a ride. The cast has pedigree and everyone commits themselves well. And the director is to be commended for reaching for the stars instead of trying to play it safe.",The Place Beyond the Pines
215,lesdroits,"ever changing plots, ever changing central characters, no pines",5,12 August 2013,"For starters, a waste of a good title -- hope this isn't a spoiler but there was nothing to do with Pines in this movie, let alone a ""Place"" in them. Given this, among other problems, the title and marketing utterly deceived. This isn't a thriller, this isn't a mystery, in fact, I don't know what this was -- nor do I know who was the central character nor what plot was the main plot. First we have one story, then it shifts to another, then another, then another. And that's all apart from the unbelievable coincidences that just happen but are central to plots 3 and 4, and apart from goofs such as the brooklyn accent by the son whose parents talk nothing like that, and other just plain stupid errors. Mind you, within the limits of the roles, there was some good acting, first by Gosling, when the movie about him, then by Bradley, ditto. Mendes good but a bit over the top at times, I thought, but Ray Liotta, in his most brief of brief appearances, is as menacing as one man can look just standing.Still -- this LONG movie felt interminable, as if the writer was just going to keep on adding new weak plots, new central characters. In short, a terrible screenplay with some decent acting.",The Place Beyond the Pines
216,BharatSamra,Yep,9,5 May 2013,"The Place Beyond the Pines makes the conventional three-act structure fear for its existence as director Derek Cianfrance ambitiously reaches beyond most standardised narrative methods. Essentially, we are told three interrelated stories that are connected through themes of legacy, family and guilt, and while one can be consistently intrigued by the manner in which the story is told, we can only appreciate it as a whole once every cinemagoer has vacated their seat, the lights turn on and the theatre staff ready the room for the next set of ticketholders who made the great decision to see The Place Beyond the Pines.Rather than expose you to its greatness in one overflow of majesty, the filmmakers manage to keep you intrigued with just a few elements at a time. From the establishing shot it is the cinematographic style that grips even our peripheral vision so intensely that even if the fire alarm was to sound, you wouldn't hear because you would be so invested into the beautifully shot film. Additionally, the score in The Place Beyond the Pines is so superbly appropriate and enchanting that your other three senses establish a sense of jealousy that only sight and sound can witness the film. Overall though, the entire film is held together by the terrific cast and you feel the project would collapse had lesser actors been chosen due to the surprising amount of dramatic tension involved. Eva Mendes, Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper as the principle cast are simply sensational in their respective roles. Most notably, Ryan Gosling as Luke, the stuntman turned criminal provides such a calm demeanour that you feel could detonate into an aggressive monster at any moment. Gosling has such control over his emotions and upon the early discovery of his son's existence, a thing of beauty takes place on screen where anyone watching can feel the emotional depth and dramatic reality.The narrative techniques that are incorporated into The Place Beyond the Pines resemble that of the recent Cloud Atlas, though not nearly as convoluted as the Wachowski film. Quite simply put, the story sees the figurative passing of the torch as we follow different characters that enlighten us to their path and perspective of the one story as a whole. It really does take you until the end of the film in order to determine your individual verdict, as throughout there are directions that are taken which, at their particular moment appear to be unwelcome, but when they are given an opportunity to flourish and express their intention to the story as whole, you realise their relevance and your perhaps slight benevolence to your appreciation. The benevolence arises due to your (or at least my) complete surprise at what unfolded before my eyes for 140 minutes. My expectations were completely misinterpreted, by my own self, because what The Place Beyond the Pines delivers is such a exceptionally delightful astonishment that you leave feeling quite fulfilled because you received a lot more than what you thought you were in for.In spite of the almost undisputable array of fantastic characters accompanied by their portrayers, unfortunate mention does need to be given to one character. Avery Cross' (Bradley Cooper's) son in the film is given a fine performance by Emory Cohen, but it is the characterisation that is questionable. The film offers absolutely no reason for the character to behave in such an undeniably uncharacteristic manner. His accent, behaviour and attitude appear to be contrived and attained from some cinematic cliché of a high school, as some term, 'douchebag'. It shouldn't probably infuriate as much as it does because everything else that surrounds the character is brilliant, but it still is the cause for much irritation.The Place Beyond the Pines is an exceedingly entertaining and engaging experience that almost feels like a game show. Breathable air in the theatre diminishes due to the profusion of gasps that occur at each instance of unpredictable exposition. You feel this is a collective outing at the cinema as all audience members respond to the surprising elements of the film in a similar manner, we all laugh at the same time, we all cry at the quite emotionally unanticipated moments and we all enjoy. The Place Beyond the Pines is much like a game show in that you feel compelled to scream at the screen in order to tell the on screen participants what to do. Maybe it is the knowing that they cannot hear you, maybe it's your social fear from having 100 pairs of eyes divert their attention to your rudeness, but either way, that is how engaging and intriguing The Place Beyond the Pines is.",The Place Beyond the Pines
217,thefadingcam,"Could be a masterpiece, has perfect moments, but the result is unbalanced",7,26 September 2013,"Where to begin... Director Derek Cianfrance sets the bar high, very, very high, with The Place Beyond The Pines. He tries to tell a complex story which core resides on how linked fathers and sons are, their decisions and their poetic fate, throwing a very singular narrative style. The ambiance, the tone, the color, the plans, and, most of all, the camera work, are absolutely masterful. Yes, masterful. The Place Beyond The Pines is divided into three segments, each segment is leaded by one main character, building a puzzle that, even if well done, is hard to accept as a viewer. Also, there are mixed feelings about how the movie develops, and its length can be legitimately questioned... Ryan Gosling has an almost incredible performance (its funny tough how this character is so similar to the protagonist in Drive or Only God Forgives, only this time much, much deeper and well developed), Bradley Cooper impresses and the other actors all deliver a above the average performances, even if their screen time is limited. The Place Beyond The Pines really could be a masterpiece: it has masterful stand-alone moments, but the final product feels unbalanced. Making such an ambitious movie successfully is very hard, but Derek Cianfrance certainly proves that he is one of the best new directors out there, and The Place Beyond The Pines is undoubtedly technically almost perfect.

The second section focuses on Bradley Cooper's cop, hailed as a hero but who finds it a mixed blessing carrying both danger but also opportunities worth exploiting. Once the headline appears on screen 'Fifteen Years later', we are in the third section and it's here that the film completely falls apart. The story becomes melodramatic and utterly predictable; the coincidences and plot contrivances are just ridiculous.To make matters worse we are served up a load of cod-psychology about fathers and sons.

All I can say I was very proud to watch how well this film was shot. I saw many spots I remembered growing up there. Cooper was great and so were all the locals that filled in with bit parts.So I guess I am a little partial to this one, but I thought it was a very good movie.

223,Kane20,Actions have consequences...,10,25 April 2013,"The Place Beyond the Pines opens with a very long tracking shot that follows a motorcycle stunt driver, Luke (Ryan Gosling), across a carnival and into a tent containing the spherical metal stunt cage. This long tracking is an indicator that this is going to be an ambitious, self-aware piece of filmmaking. And that's what it is. Piercing through jumble of other films of the early spring like a high-intensity electromagnetic wave comes The Place Beyond the Pines, a well-written, well-acted, well-directed, emotional, intelligent, suspenseful, multi-layered, thought-provoking film, and, in my opinion, one of the best films of the year so far. It is three-part drama that unfolds over a completely justified running length of nearly two and a half hours.The first part of the film is about the aforementioned tattooed motorcycle stunt daredevil, Luke, a good-hearted but reckless and troubled man. Ryan Gosling puts on an excellent performance, bringing this character to life. A great portion of his performance is dialogue-free and big on actions and facial expressions. When he does speak, he speaks quietly and deliberately.Eva Mendes plays Romina, whom Luke had slept with in the past, and is now the mother of his infant son as a result of that fling. She is now with another man, but Luke, determined to provide for her and his son, quits his job as a motorcycle stunt driver and resorts to robbing banks to provide for them. This is a bad decision, obviously, and it leads to even worse decisions.This eventually leads Luke to cross paths with police officer named Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper). Pretty soon, the first act ends. The second act focuses on Avery, whom Bradley Cooper portrays with an outstanding performance. Avery is an ambitious rookie cop who looks to quickly move up the ranks in the corruption-riddled police department in which he works. The third act of the film takes place fifteen years after the end of the second act, and it focuses on the sons of Luke and Avery, who are now in high school and are haunted by the past sins of their fathers.I don't like this film as much as, say, The Godfather, but it is pretty far up there; it is bold and innovative, with a strong emphasis on character and plot development; it is a good example of expert storytelling. Also, this film has a very strong personal touch to it; I truly cared about the characters and felt all of the emotions that they felt throughout the course of their experiences – love, guilt, emotional torment, embarrassment, stress, etc. As the story progresses, it takes some surprising and sometimes shocking turns, and there is a riveting sense of tension all the way through the film.This film is great character study, and it really gives us some things to think about. It explores themes including, but not limited to, guilt, justice, revenge, love, and even a father's love for his son. However, there is one theme that stands out above the others explored in the film: consequences. Actions have consequences, the effects of which affect other people and the world, and can even ripple through time and generations. The film emphasizes and illustrates this theme very strongly, and it gives us some good food for thought on the subject.The movie is excellently filmed, and while the camera work and cinematography is by no means the primary draw of the film, it really enhanced the experience and helped pull me into the film. The music score is also very good. Overall, I can think of very little to criticize about this film. Although, I do have to admit, the third act of the film was slightly less powerful than the previous two, and a little too slow. But I still found it very compelling.Again, overall, this film is en excellent example of what can result from a great script, great performances, great directing, and lots of heart and emotional punch. This film has one of the strongest and most genuine heartbeats that I have felt in a film in quite a while. I highly recommend this film.Remember, actions have consequences. Never forget that. Negative actions result in negative consequences. Good actions result in good consequences. For example, Derek Cianfrance put in a great deal of focus and effort into making this film, and the consequence is that he made an emotionally riveting, multi-layered, thought-provoking masterpiece, which has earned high praise from me, and will hopefully at least receive an Oscar nomination.My rating: **** (out of ****)",The Place Beyond the Pines
224,manusanchez90,"Original drama! 8,1!",8,11 June 2013,"""The place beyond the pines"" lived up to my expectations. It is an excellent dramatic movie. I do not know why it has not still been released in the theaters from my country (Spain). The thing that firstly attracted me the most from the movie is its cast: Eva Mendes (one of my favourite actresses, Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper and Ray Liotta. I saw another movie directed by director Derek Cianfrance and starred by Gosling called ""Blue valentine"" which I disliked. This time, he did a better job. This movie focuses on both the plot and the characters development. The pace is a bit slow, which does not mean at all that the movie is boring, in fact it is very entertaining, but realistic, too. One of the best things in the movie is the fact that there is not just one protagonist, but three. It is not about three independent stories that join in one moment like ""Babel"" and ""21 grams"". In this case, it is more sequential. During the first third of the movie, the protagonist is Ryan Gosling, next, he is Cooper and later, the first protagonist's son. The movie takes place in a rural town or village from the State of New York. The scenography is simple, but very correct and adequate for a drama like this. The cast is another strong thing. Ryan Gosling plays the part of stunt motorbike cycler who disappears from his home for a year, so his lover leaves him for another man in spite of having a son with him. For a living, Ryan's character begins to rob banks. Bradley Cooper plays the part of a rogue cop. They two delivered solid performances (Cooper's most serious one of his career). Eva Mendes is more than correct in a very dramatic and serious role. Ray Liotta is more secondary, but very good, too. Rose Byrne is another actress from the part who worked well but more secondarily. The young actor Dane Dehaan plays the part of Gosling's character's teenager son. His role is very dramatic and shows lots of potential. Do not expect action. There is action just in a chase between the robber and the policemen and the two bank robberies (very realistic and necessary action). The script is centered on both the story and the characters, that is why good and profound performances were required. There are some violently dramatic scenes (realistic again, not gore or tarantinesque). In conclusion, the strenghts of this movie are its cast, performances and plot. It is not the fluidest movie of the year anyway and there is nothing special about dialogues (they are not bad at all). I recommend ""The place beyond the pines"" for the fans of any of the main actors and to those who enjoy realistic dramas with some intrigue. 8,1.",The Place Beyond the Pines
225,austinfromdahood,One of Derek Cianfrance's best,9,1 October 2018,"If you've been reading my movie reviews, you can probably tell that I love Ryan Gosling as an actor and as a person. In real life, he is a quiet, but really funny and charismatic man. But on the big screen, he is a phenomenal actor. He has even said that he doesn't act in too many movies because he doesn't want people to be sick of seeing him in a bunch of movies. At first, I thought that was a statement I wouldn't hear from much actors, but I realized that statement is 100% true. I love Samuel L. Jackson, but I can safely say he is in way to many movies. I just love him because of his memorable roles. I also like how Ryan Gosling chooses very interesting roles. He chooses roles that would challenge the actor, that are very different from other actors. Drive, Lars and the real girl, Blue Valentine, and the movie I'll be talking about today, The Place Beyond the Pines. If you're reading this review, please watch the movie first if you haven't, because I think you shouldn't know anything about the plot before watching it. I'll be getting into spoilers in this review, so watch the movie first if you haven't, then go back to this review. A while back ago, I was on a Ryan Gosling movie spree. I watched many of his movies and I think this movie is easily one of his top 5 movies. Ryan Gosling plays a motorcycle stuntman that performs at a circus. He then has to rob banks to ensure his child's future, while the mom is with another man. Bradley Cooper is also in this movie, and he plays as a police officer that does good and bad things to keep his image alive. I'll stop it right there for a plot synopsis. Ryan Gosling is great in this movie, he is very broken, and he has very powerful moments in this film, and he's only in this movie for like an hour! Eva Mendes plays Ryan Gosling's old flame, and throughout the whole film, her performance and actions really kept me invested in her journey as a mother trying to cope and help with her son, played by Dane Dehaan. Bradley Cooper's subplot also melds with Ryan Gosling/Eva Mendes/Dane Dehaan's subplot in a powerful message that is fatherhood passes down to sonhood, and that the father's decisions will also impact the son's decision on a situation. That's the best I could describe it, and I thought that was the best part of the movie, its message/meaning. It really impacted me, and made me think about my relationship with my father. I don't have the best relationship with him, and it kind of reflects on the message of this movie. Another thing I want to talk about is that one part in the movie where the film really shifts into a different tone. When Ryan Gosling gets killed by Bradley Cooper, we then follow bradley Cooper and his journey. At first, I was really confused about why the film did this, but in the end, I really knew why. The film reflects on Ryan Gosling's relationship with his son, and Bradley Cooper's relationship with his son, and the film ends with concluding both of these relationships in the story in such an artistic way, it left me speechless the first time. Other great things about this movie that I will keep short is the cinematography, screenplay, character moments, interesting camera angles, and its ending. This film I feel like I can't give 5 stars because the second time I watched it, it didn't feels as good as the first time. I don't know why, but it just did and both viewing did feel a little long at times. Other than that, this is a great movie that you should watch soon. 9/10",The Place Beyond the Pines
226,generationfilm,"The Place Beyond the Pines- A Triptych Reflecting on Guilt, Redemption, and Forgiveness that is Ambitious to a Fault",7,30 March 2013,"Ambition should never be ignored, especially in the realm of cinema where choreographed visuals, intense dramatization, and thematic contemplations can all play a part in transforming entertainment into genuine art. One of these aspiring cinematic poets is the late bloomer Derek Cianfrance who astonished audiences with his grittily authentic relationship drama Blue Valentine, an endeavor that took 12 years to write and create. His latest drama The Place Beyond the Pines is as aspiring as his last and though it is unarguably longwinded and falters on occasion there is much to be admired in its thematic ideas, its technical mastery, and its dramatic ambition. Structured as a triptych, a story split into three distinct but interlinking parts, The Place Beyond the Pines casts a large net of deep seated contemplations on guilt, redemption, and forgiveness. This incredibly Catholic inspired philosophical drama has its own trinity of disconnected fathers, isolated sons, and broken spirits as it showcases the negative consequences of personal aspiration, criminal enterprise, and negating responsibility. All of these heavy themes combined with Cianfrance's cinematic ability to capture unsettling and realistic interactions will definitely exhaust most viewers, but there is no doubting that The Place Beyond the Pines elucidates the consequences of family and heritage as much as Blue Valentine reflected on romantic disconnection. As each chapter of this dramatic trinity unfolds to be less interesting than the last there is much to be admired in Cianfrance's dramatic realism, subtle technical achievements, and his fine direction of accomplished actors. Ambition should always be recognized even when the execution isn't up to par with the depth of intentions and The Place Beyond the Pines shows an auteur who is finding unique ways to express his own philosophical contemplations through the medium of film.Read more: http://wp.me/py8op-xa More reviews: generationfilm.net",The Place Beyond the Pines
227,jeffreyjets,...and???,5,16 February 2014,"It ended and I and not sure why it began. It meandered through a lot of decent acting and possibly good plot changes, but accomplished little or nothing and moved no where, other than I think it made money. I think relationship movies need to have warning labels that state, ""This film accomplishes absolutely nothing, so make sure you are in touch with your feminine side or bring your girlfriend to watch."" We did learn one thing: Ryan Gosling should not be bleach blonde, just like Angelina Jolie.This is the directors fault. Actors did everything and more than what they were asked to do. Movies like this seem to have a so totally self involved Director that has half the story in his/her head believing that everyone is thinking the exact same thoughts in their head. Some of the reviews on IMDb appear to indicate that some were thinking that, but I am beginning to have my suspicions that many reviewers out there are friends or employees of Directors or Actors, because many make no sense whatsoever. Bottomline...not bad acting, not bad script, if you have 2 plus hours to kill and you are a fan of somebody in this film, go for it, just don't expect an ending.

It's pretty much Drive meets Killing Them Softly with family themes thrown in. But it's better than either of those films. It's never dull or boring even with a 140 min run time because it keeps changing things up and has three very distinct acts. In fact, I feel that it was too short for its high ambitions. I would not have been against it being three hours long. The direction is superb and the one shot takes that are frequently used are breathtaking. Acting was great with Gosling stealing the show. It's not perfect, but the flaws that some people mention are rather nit-picky. Not going to forget this admirable story and its hard-hitting themes anytime soon.",The Place Beyond the Pines

230,AlukardsCastle,A Beautiful Tragic Epic of Karma and Decisions!,10,6 August 2013,"I am a fan of ""The Gos""(Ryan Gosling). I admit I even tried to emulate him in ""Drive"" and ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"". He is a great actor and he always seems to make great movies whether they are mainstream or independent. He has already received recognition with an Oscar nomination for ""Half Nelson"". I was excited to see what character he would bring to life next when I heard about this movie. I saw the running time of 140 minutes and saw the trailer. I wondered how they were gonna make a movie of Gosling and Cooper last that long without dragging. Then I found out that Gosling is only in the first third of the movie despite him being the face of the movie. At first I felt disappointed, but I got over it because I know that isn't a way to judge a movie. So I went in after hearing mostly praise for this gem of a film.If most of you haven't already figured out, the movie is divided into 3 acts. The first follows Luke(Gosling) a motorcyclist from a traveling carnival who quits upon finding out he has a son. He struggles to provide for the son Jason, who's mother Romina(Eva Mendez) is now with another man. He resorts to robbing banks. These actions lead into the Second act which follows Avery(Bradley Cooper) after he has a traumatic run in with Luke. Avery, a cop who also has a son, is struggling with corruption within the police station. Soon he finds a job as the Assistant DA. The third act takes place 15 years later. Now Luke and Averys sons Jason and AJ are teenagers. Soon they become frenemies. All of the actions from the first two acts collide into a dramatic finale. That is just the gist of the plot.The first act was emotionally tense. This was also the best of the three acts in my opinion. Each act was like a mini movie. But this act could have been expanded into a separate movie if possible! It was intense, the dialogue with Ben Mendelsohns character was great. Ben Mendelsohn should really be recognized for Best Supporting Actor here. Gosling gives a great performance as an Outlaw type, but also a caring man who just wants to provide for his son.The second act featured less of the emotion from the first act and more of the crime aspect of the movie. For a second I thought Martin Scorcese had taken over the script. That is a compliment. Cooper also does great acting here! At first you will hate his character, but as you realize what is going on, you will almost forget about the first act and now focus on the story of Avery! The third act seems to be getting the least praise. I am confused with that. Some are saying it was unneeded. I strongly disagree with those opinions! This was the perfect way to end this story! Many people are complaining that it was too cliché to include this part. It wasn't as good as the first two acts, but it was still great. The fact that the two sons meet and become friends is intriguing. It makes you wonder what will happen scene after scene. Great climatic ending to the movie! The directing is top notch. This movie is beautiful to watch. It did what movies that use an overload of CGI mostly can't do. It told a genuinely good and tension filled story. I do like some movies with some good CGI, but I love movies that don't rely on special effects even more! The acting was stunning from all members of the cast. Its hard to choose a best actor between Gosling and Cooper, but there is no doubt in my mind that Ben Mendelsohn did a magnificent job in his supporting role! The story of this movie is gut wrenching. Its a drama. Its a crime drama. Its a thriller. Its even a R rated High School movie in the final act at times. It is a modern epic tragedy. It is a tale of karma and decisions. I personally think it is much better than Director Derek Cianfrances last film with Gosling ""Blue Valentine"". This movie had me on the edge of my seat throughout, especially in the third act. Again regarding the third act, I think most people aren't too keen with it because of the way one of the teens talks throughout. I got used to it within 5 minutes though as I thought it was actually a nice touch. The music of the movie is brilliantly placed too. The musical score by Mike Patton was haunting and beautiful. The track ""Snow Angel"" is one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever created for film. The main theme cuts deep especially the way it was used in the film! Stay with the credits to finalize the experience because the song ""The Wolves"" by Bon Iver that plays is a true emotional masterpiece that goes well with the movie that preceded it! I recommend this movie to anybody that loves a genuinely good original movie. This movie does demand your full attention though. If needed, you might have to put on the subtitles to fully understand some of the less audible dialogue. But that is your personal choice. This is a great movie for men particularly, whether you're a father, a son or both. This movie is great for women too, but men will have a more personal experience! This movie will stick with you either way!",The Place Beyond the Pines
231,jonruff108,Beautiful Movie,8,23 November 2014,"I decided to finally watch this movie after seeing Chris Stuckman's review on YouTube and I have to say, I'm a little speechless. This isn't a movie to just slop a label on; it deserves more than that. The only word that comes to mind is ""beautiful"" because, really, it was just that.That being said, there were a few clichés, etc., but they, (very) surprisingly, didn't stop me from really getting into the story and characters. The acting certainly helped. Ryan Gosling was absolutely fantastic and brought more to the role than I felt was actually written. You could really see how tortured and full of pain he was. The rest of the acting was fantastic as well; all the actors brought this natural feel and intensity of emotion that just made it all feel so real.This is a hard movie for me to rate with a single number because, in my opinion, it had a fair amount of things that just didn't work. But when it did work, oh boy did they work. The move is laser focused on the people in it's story and it's told fabulously.Also, splitting the movie into three distinct acts worked wonders. I was not expecting that at all (I hadn't even seen the trailers). It created this richness with the characters that you can't really appreciate until you've seen the final act.Overall, I'm extremely happy to have seen this movie. It isn't a movie for everyone by any means but I think that was kind of the point. Those are usually the movies that resonate with me the most.",The Place Beyond the Pines
232,dapplegrey13,"Gosling, Gosling, Gosling - heartbreaking",7,15 April 2013,"What can one say about Ryan Gosling's performance in this film? There are just no words -- but I'll try. He is so emotive, so heart-wrenching, and yet as tough as steel. Overall, I was disappointed in the movie as I felt the last half was way, way too slow (my date actually said as the credits rolled ""MAN that was a long, long movie!"")I believe, however, the first half of the film was fantastic and I was completely engrossed.I do NOT like this director's constant extreme close-ups and shaky camera/erratic camera methods.Eva Mendez was also more beautiful than ever and she really showed her fine acting skills, too, I felt.Because the film was so slow towards the second half, it's hard for me to give this a strong recommendation -- however, if you're a Ryan Gosling fan, I'd say it's well worth the 2-1/2 hours to enjoy him. Thank you, thank you Ryan for giving it your all.",The Place Beyond the Pines
233,Victreebong,Tends to germinate in the mind.,8,9 May 2013,"This is a movie that you'll be thinking about weeks after you see it. The characters in the film make the movie, whether it's Gosling's bad boy with a good heart antics, Cooper's personal moral war on his departments underhanded enforcement practices, or the two teenagers who compose nearly every camp of iconic soc vs. stoner high school confrontation. Gosling is at his finest, Mendes delivers with sexuality and emotion, Cooper turns to a role more flawed than the one in Silver Linings Playbook. I'd tell you who the two adolescent actors are and their respective performances, but IMDb has trouble with listing first billed actors, apparently.Music in the film sets a perfect mood for the subsequent mini plots. Pacing can be really intense, and then subdued for longer periods. In other words, the pacing wrecks the experience. Which is why the performances are so vital for the enjoyment of this movie. If you don't watch movies for the acting, don't see Place Beyond the Pines. It's also close to three hours in length, delivering several paralleling story arcs, so prepare to invest some time in this flick.The continual troubling drama of the characters, and their stellar performances is what makes this movie something to dwell over. If you're a Gosling or Cooper film buff solely viewing this flick for either (or both), there's plenty to love about both actors. They deliver outstanding experiences with their craftsmanship.",The Place Beyond the Pines

236,tomassparups,Another win on the behalf of Cianfrance,8,18 July 2013,"Derek Cianfrance's second collaboration with Ryan Gosling: ""The Place Beyond The Pines"" is an electric and heart-wrenching crime drama with an all star cast. The films shifts between three intertwined stories, at the beginning of the film we are introduced to Ryan Gosling's character, a famous traveling motorcycle stuntman named Luke Glanton. While on tour Luke performs a show in his home town where he encounters his former lover Romina, played by Eva Mendes. He soon finds out that hes is the father of Romina's infant son. Unfortunately Romina has settled with a man name Kofi, who does not approve of Luke's interference in they're family life. Nevertheless Luke decides to quit his job as a stuntman, settle into the town and start to provide for his son. He lands a job at an auto-repair garage, but soon understands that he is not making nearly enough money to provide for his son. He and the owner of the garage, a man named Robin, played by Ben Mendelsohn decide to earn money by robbing banks.Chaos ensues and soon enough we are introduced to Bradley Cooper's character, an ambitious rookie cop who is connected with Gosling by fate. The film then follows two other different stories, all equally gripping. The Place Beyond the Pines is the best film i have seen in 2013 so far. I was thoroughly invested in the character's and the film grasped my attention to the very end. Derek Cianfrance showcases his directorial skill in this film with perfectly paced and dynamic story telling. The acting is superb from the entire cast and the writing is energetic. That being said ""The Place Beyond The Pines"" is not a perfect film, towards the end it does tend to drag on a bit and some of the plot points were a tad bit predictable. I would also have liked if the story would have explored the characters past in more depth. Though these are merely my personal nitpicks. The conclusion to the film completely blew me away and left me asking questions. ""The Place Beyond The Pines"" is a harsh, but beautiful film about crime and relationship's between fathers and sons. I highly recommend it.",The Place Beyond the Pines
237,tvmovienews,The Place Beyond the Pines,7,5 August 2013,"This is a crime/drama film directed by Derek Cianfrance and stars Ryan Gosling who also appeared in his last film, 'Blue Valentine'. Gosling is joined by Bradley Cooper, Eva Mendes , Ben Mendelsohn, Rose Byrne and Ray Liotta. As you can see it is a huge cast. The Place Beyond the Pines is about a motorcycle stunt rider who turns to bank robbing as a way to provide for his lover and newborn child. This puts him into a collision course with an ambitious rookie cop who is trying to navigate a department ruled by a corrupt detective. This movie definitely won't please everyone, but personally I loved it.The movie is broken up into three parts, focusing on a different character at a time. So we don't actually see Bradley Cooper until a third of the way in, with the beginning focusing on Ryan Gosling's story. This was really well done as every story has plenty of substance and helped break up the 140 minute runtime. The three parts merge beautifully into each other, showing the major implications caused by the characters actions throughout the film. I think the ending will also cause a divide in opinion, but I thought it was a fitting conclusion. The acting was terrific by the entire cast, in particular Bradley Cooper's whose performance rivalled his work in Silver Linings Playbook. It's also great to see Australian actor Ben Mendelsohn starting to get regular work in Hollywood. He is a great actor and definitely deserves to succeed. The music was handled by Mike Patton, which is pretty cool as the man is a genius. The camera work was also fairly unique in parts, as we watch some of the characters interacting from unusual angles.As I said earlier, this definitely won't be for everyone as it requires some concentration to follow the plot.My Rating: 7.5/10 For more Movie and TV News, Reviews and Rumours go to: www.facebook.com/tvmovienews",The Place Beyond the Pines

239,theneilrules,Wonderful,8,5 June 2013,"This is an amazing movie stuffed with intense emotional drama. This happens to be the first movie I have seen from writer-director Derek Cianfrance and I can say for sure he is a very talented guy. All the actors gave powerful performances in accordance with the brilliant direction. The ones I liked in this flick are certainly Gosling and Cooper. You all may have seen Bradley Cooper in action packed and comic roles. See this one and you will know how emotionally powerful he can be. Ryan Gosling is maturing as an actor as well. Although, his semblance is concise, he intensifies the screen with his presence. Eva Mendes is superb in showing her sentiments flowing. One other young actor who shines is Dane DeHaan. I saw him in Lawless and Chronicle. He's gonna go very far if he continues in this fashion.The story is fairly acceptable but the main focus of this movie is the acting. It sanguinely shows that we can never turn our back on fate. Fate has its own way of grooming us.Probably, one of the best dramas I've seen lately. A must watch. 8/10.",The Place Beyond the Pines

Not in an action style, nor suspenseful; no, it's just that all the characters are really intense people; they really are, and although the movie slows down in several parts, the acting keeps you glued to it.This is a movie about the lives of two very unlikable people, and how events keep them related although one of them no longer lives. Their families are also unlikable, especially their kids. Yet, they are intensely attractive and the two boys that played the parts are more than great. DeHaan is spectacular. He plays the young man destined to be an outcast, yet he endorses his life with such dignity, it's almost heartbreaking.This is probably one of the most underrated movies ever; watch it.",The Place Beyond the Pines

242,snookie-6,One of the best movies I've seen recently,10,5 March 2019,"I often get into arguments with my girlfriend, cause she loves and studies cinema and I just love certain types of movies. She follows movies more chaotically then me and loves more about movies than I do. I, personally, want to know three things before I pick a movie.
The names of the actors. The name/s of the screenwriter/s. The name of the director.
So we argued a bit and we put this on. It starts okay. Ryan Gosling is cool. When I saw Ray Liotta's name I got psyched to see him, he is a favorite of mine. In the middle of the film I was already seeing that this movie has a lot more to offer than it first shows.
One of my favorite things is when I see younger actors in a scene with older actors. Liotta really shows them how it's done. Gosling is great, Cooper is very believable, I'm adding Ben Mendelsohn to my list, Dane DeHaan is a really promising kid... but man, that Ray Liotta stare reminded me I once was moved by movies. He just does so much with so little, every gesture he makes is a movie worth watching by itself.
And, of course, the thing I read most of the people loved about this film. The story. At about the middle of the film I guessed that this is not gonna be an ordinary storytelling. I love it when a neat idea for plot development comes to me mid-film and it turns out I guessed it right. These moments are really cool, they make the movie feel like it's made specially for me.
So yeah, one hour in I was hoping for the film to go in a certain direction and not only did it go in that direction, it exceeded my expectations of what movies can do. It's a great watch. Starts a bit slow, but it has its reasons for doing so.
Easily one of the best movies I've seen for the last 10 years.",The Place Beyond the Pines
243,cuthbertjoel,Started Off Amazing But Downwards From There,6,19 February 2015,"So this film is split into three distinct sections. All the sections relate to each other over a 15 year time period but do stand alone as their own mini-sections. Credit given for the brave move for the director to attempt this.Section 1 has Ryan Gosling playing a carnival stunt bike rider who realises on old flame (Eva Mendes) has had his child. This for me is the best part of the film.Section 2 has Bradley Cooper as a policeman who is given a heroes welcome back to work but soon finds himself in the corrupt world of underhand dealings within the police department Section 3 revolves around the grown up children of both Gosling's and Cooper's character.I don't want to elaborate too much and give any of the plot away.Doing the film this way though made it way too long. So much of the momentum built up in the first section is just lost as the movie seems to run out of steam. The third section didn't particularly add anything to the film and the two young actors were never going to match up to what Gosling and Cooper had laid down as a marker.I was so disappointed as after 40 minutes or so, this had the makings of a blockbuster. But after the strong start, it just seems to go through the motions and meander towards a pretty generic ending.The first 40 mins were 10/10, but the rest of the movie drags its score down.",The Place Beyond the Pines
244,pelhamc,A Place of Dramatic Conflict,10,24 July 2016,"A Place Beyond the Pines is a crime drama with an unconventional timeline. It deals with the generational impact of crime. When a dirtbag dirtbike rider turned bankrobber has a run in with an ambitious hotshot cop, worlds collide. The story follows the situational fallout as their sons make friends at school and get into trouble together. It all goes down in Schenectady, New York, Mohawk for ""The Place Beyond the Pines."" It's an intriguing title and an intriguing concept.This picture boasts an all-star cast of Ryan Gosling (The Notebook, Drive) as the rebellious carny, real-life wife Eva Mendez (Training Day, Hitch) as the Hudson Valley heartbreaker, and Bradley Cooper (The Hangover, Silver Linings Playbook) as the political crime fighter, with Australian character actor Ben Mendelsohn (The Dark Knight Rises, Animal Kingdom) as the grease monkey accomplice. The cinematography was breathtaking, especially the scenes of the capital region. This picture was experimental in several ways. From the opening scene at a traveling show, we see the protagonist wheel around an enclosed dome, trick riding, and the momentum continues. As in Gosling's critically acclaimed Drive, there are prolonged car chase scenes with minimal cuts in the film. The visual effect blends events together and keeps the adrenalin pumping. Movement was a theme in the story. Events propel the story forward as they beget circumstances, much like the physical force going forward on screen. For every action there is a chain reaction, with consequences. The choppiness of the plot was unique and accentuated by the blending of scenes. Several years span within the story, in keeping with the generational theme. This picture was well- written, with developed characters. When I saw the main character in a Ride the Lightning T- shirt in the opening scene, I was in, and along for the ride. Like the classic album by Metallica, the storytelling in The Place Beyond the Pines does not disappoint. The actors gave good performances. Gosling was charismatic, Mendez smoldering, Cooper was suave and layered, and the kids were great. It was a cool concept, flawless execution. The only thing I didn't like about it was the same old ""learning to be a better father"" subplot that for some reason has to be in every other major release these days (?!). Enough already with the daddy issues. I was surprised this one didn't do better at the box office, perhaps because it was more of a straight drama, as opposed to a genre picture. The drama is more about the characters' personal lives than a heist movie. Eva Mendez cuts a statuesque figure. The bankrobber's lust for her pushes him over the edge.",The Place Beyond the Pines

246,ace_nair,"Movie with heart, but not strong enough",7,4 August 2014,"TPBTP is a crime drama which plays in two different time-lines set about 15 years apart.The story is about a motorcycle stuntman (Ryan Gosling) who discovers he has a son from a relationship with his former ex-girlfriend (Eva Mendes). To provide for his son, he turns to crime and soon the law catches up to him in the form of a policeman (Bradley Cooper) who has been on the force for a year. Twists, turns and fifteen years later, the lives of the next generation entwine and conclude with the wheels set in motion by the stuntman.That's it. I have kept a lot of details out. :)Cianfrance takes his time to weave in his characters and build-up the suspense through to various sub-plots. The senior cast of Gosling, Mendes and Cooper do a great job staying in their respective characters with a fine performance by Ben Mendelsohn. Almost-cameo roles by seasoned stars like Ray Liotta, Bruce Greenwood and Harris Yulin with popular TV screen names like Rose Byrne and Mahershala Ali add that touch of somber gravitas to the narration.However, the casting of Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen as the 15-16 year- olds really put me off. They looked too old for their character's age and I had trouble relating to their characters because of that. This affects the final my rating of what could have been a real gem of a movie. I recommend watching this movie on a lazy holiday afternoon as it runs for nearly 2&½ hours and you should let the feel of the 1970-80's drama film-making take you in. By the end of the movie ensure you are drinking a cup of green tea and munching some biscuits. You'll have a lovely day.",The Place Beyond the Pines
247,Kings_Requiem,The sins of the Father are the sins of the Son,9,23 March 2015,"Wow. This was OMG good. I don't wanna get too hyperbolic with this review, so I'll just say that I loved it. It's just a towering film. I've never used that term before to describe a movie, but for this movie its just really fitting. Cooper was amazing. This is definitely on par with his SLP performance. Gosling is pretty great as well. Sort of an extension of his Drive character, but much more erratic. Mendes probably makes the most out of her thinly written character. She has a couple of key moments, but for me didn't really have much of an impact in the grand scheme of things. DeHaan has his moments. The film isn't perfect, but damn does it come close. A lot of my problems with it could just be me nitpicking. There were a few things in different spots throughout that I wish could have gone into a little more detail...nothing major, but just an extra couple minutes here or a few minutes there I think would've been helpful. My biggest complaint is probably Emory Cohen...his performance is really bad. He comes off like a gangster John Travolta and its really annoying. But like I said those are just tiny little blemishes that are probably just me being nit-picky. So for me its two masterful acts and an OK final act. That's 90% of a masterpiece that doesn't completely stick its landing. It's still fantastic and well worth seeing. Judging from the reviews its already a divisive film, which doesn't surprise me. It's a long movie at 2 hours and 20 minutes which turns some people off right away and its a heavy drama which can be patience trying for some people as well. Not everyone will like it and not everyone needs to, but I think everyone should at least SEE it just to decide for yourself. This is an emotionally draining picture that features some fantastic performances and touches on a lot of deep themes. It offers no easy answers and doesn't pander to the audience. It is a completely enthralling film that is equal parts crime drama and morality tale. I can't recommend it enough and I hope people get out to see it and they enjoy it as much as I did.",The Place Beyond the Pines
248,Sammy_Sam_Sam,Muddled and absurd,3,3 May 2013,"It's very rare that I go to the cinema and feel so differently when leaving than I did when I went in. It takes a remarkable movie to do this and there's no doubt about it, The Place Beyond the Pines truly is remarkable. The film is probably best described as being three poor movies squeezed into one, truly awful movie. I've noticed others describe it as 'three acts', but that description is pretty kind to say the least. For the most part it's well acted, but the movie doesn't seem to know what it wants to be and as a result, before long it loses it's way. And regardless of what it was supposed to be, after viewing it leaves you asking so many searching questions. Questions like: Who was the protagonist in the movie? What was the point of this film? Who came up with such a convoluted and absurd storyline and why weren't they stopped? Why didn't Ryan Gosling's character buy more t-shirts when having robbed a bank, he could so easily afford to do so? Why didn't they steady the camera a bit so we could admire the excellent stunt work during the chase scene through the graveyard? Why did the movie keep going on and on and on and on despite the fact that by this point, none of the characters really mattered to the viewer? And why did I spend all that money going to watch this?It reminded me a lot of Mystic River and the redeeming features were just as few and far between, although I must point out that the music was superb throughout. And I suppose I should be fair and say that I did like the reference to Hall and Oates (with a bonus song later!). Ryan Gosling was brilliant, although that really shouldn't come as much of a surprise. But none of that is enough to make up for what I sat through. I was so happy when the movie ended and having waited so long, when the ending finally came it didn't disappoint. The credits rolled, the lights went on and then, at that point, I knew in my heart that everything would be okay after all.

Then you start to get the gist of what is happening and by that point I'd already lost interest.I expected this film to be something completely different so maybe I'm just the one who was disappointed rather than the film itself being disappointing but hey the part I did enjoy was worth the entire watch anyway.",The Place Beyond the Pines
251,tjsprik,"Where is the 'place beyond the pines,' and why does it matter?",4,15 December 2013,"This is a very long movie, so let me spare you the 2 1/2 hours and advise you to skip this one.It starts out with such promise as it develops the story of bad-boy Gosling trying to be a responsible father to his infant son. But when he makes some bone-headed decisions in a bank robbery that goes awry, good-bye bad-boy Gosling and hello bad-boy Cooper. Thus begins the second story (of three), this one about a police officer who tries to keep himself from corruption within his department, but who suffers from corruption as well when he uses a form of blackmail to get the promotion he wants. Meanwhile he's an absentee father, focusing solely on his career. Eventually he runs for state District Attorney, which is where the story takes it third and final turn.Enter bad-boy sons of above-mentioned bad-boy fathers. What will happen when their paths cross? And is it worth waiting almost two and a half hours to find out? (hint--no, it's not).Don't waste your time on this anti-climactic attempt. Despite great performances by Gosling and Mendez, this movie is disappointing. It had great potential, but fell flat about 2/3 of the way through.

252,anteksw,A Perfect Film In My Eyes,10,26 January 2014,"My first review here on IMDb, and so I decided to review one of my favourite films; The Place Beyond The Pines. Just a word of warning, this review contains a few major spoilers; so if you haven't seen the film then don't read this review, as this film is a must-see in my opinion. But hey, let's get to the actual review. The film starts off with our main character, Luke (played by Ryan Gosling) walking through an amusement park accompanied by loud noises, as the opening credits are shown. The strong start (despite the fact not much is happening at this moment) has you hooked from the beginning, as your curiosity grows. Another major character is introduced within the first few minutes, and thus the film keeps you enticed from the very beginning. Some may call this poor narrative structure, as it may seem slightly rushed, I however say this is clever pacing. Mainly because crime/drama films have been so over-done during the past few years, and each one is so similar to the other, along with the clichés which just keep going. This film does it differently.Derek Cianfrance decided to bring his own style into this, avoiding clichés, and deciding to completely change the focus from one character to another. Luke's character gets killed off 50 minutes into the film, in an intense and at the same time emotional scene. The focus from Luke's character to Avery's character (played by Bradley Cooper) may seem like a silly decision, but the film gives enough time to develop the character of a cop which may seem pretentious, yet gains our sympathy as the film develops. Family problems and teenager issues are brought into the film, and as always I adore reality in films and so this worked perfectly for me; the relationships between the sons and their parents are perfectly executed. With truly amazing acting by the entire cast, the emotions conveyed by each character are absorbed by the audience instantly, and we feel sympathetic towards most of the main characters, especially towards the character of Jason (played by Dane DeHaan) despite some of his doubtful decisions which are common in teenagers. The pressure is always on.I could praise this film all day, as it ticks all my boxes for a perfect motion picture. I do however definitely need to mention the soundtrack; it's truly amazing, well-fitted, great-sounding and highly memorable. Two gorgeous bike scenes are accompanied by a beautiful theme (The Snow Angel) which fits the film perfectly, many other memorable songs and themes are used throughout film and each one accompanies the scenes perfectly. To conclude; amazing performances, a perfect soundtrack, well-structured characters, memorable sequences and most importantly a highly compelling plot. One of my favourite films of all time, and a perfect film in my eyes.",The Place Beyond the Pines

Ryan ""Robot"" Gosling's role was short lived in the movie and was ridiculous. Bradley Cooper eventually shows us half way through the movie as a ""crooked"" hero cop that is taking pleasure in being the hero after murder & theft. Eva Mendez was the only actor that was decent and she had a minor, useless role. Once Ray Liotta entered the movie, the story comes apart. I so disappointed and wish we rented another movie. Don't be fooled by the usual, amazing cast. This was a terrible movie and would have rated it lower without the actors used in the film.",The Place Beyond the Pines
254,thegreatshonen,"Sprawling epic from an upcoming great mind, A modern East of Eden",9,15 April 2013,"So I've been hyped for this movie since January. It came out right around the time of my birthday last week and my friends and I went see it. Sme films should be talked about I feel and other need to be talked about, I believe this movie falls in the latter category.The story follows 2 generations of fathers and sons through their lives starting with Luke Glanton, a motor cyclist who takes up crime to support his infant son and a woman he had a one night fling with. Then comes the story of Avery cross , a rookie cop who ""apprehends"" Luke and becomes a hero in the police force while dealing with its corruption. Finally the last arc revolves around their 2 sons who go to high school and befriend one another.When I watched this movie I immediately thought of East of Eden. It's a similar story about relationship between family and father and sons. The use of CinemaScope also highlights that film, as the cinematography highlights this one. The novel especially has the themes of this movie also so it feels like a modern take on the novel.I'm not going to say any more than that about the story. What I will talk about is the feel of this movie. Luke introduction at the beginning of the movie was chilling ad haunting, one of the most memorable introductions in years. Ryan Gosling acting was also excellent and probably could get an Oscar nomination. Bradley Cooper also churns out another solid performance after Silver Lingings Playbook, showing he's one of the better young actors out there with Ryan gosling. The supporting cast is also notable with a really standout performance from Eva Mendes( though she's kind of bipolar in the movie.) The 3rd acts main characters, the children of the 2 fore mentioned men, are serviceable in their 1st true roles and its hard to live up to the talents of the other cast. The cinematography is also absolutely stunning. It has a clean beautiful, but also gritty home-y feel to it that you get lost in during the movie. The soundtrack is very distinct and different, far from some of the 1 style scores of movie composers nowadays. It has its problems though but barely. The 3 arc story structure unfortunately can leave some parts of the last 2 story weaker and overall it could've ended slightly better. This film announced someone of great new talent in the world of Film, Derek Cianfrance. I could feel myself at some points in this movie smile gleefully because I could feel this guys talent and just how amazing some parts of this film was. He still has room for improvement, but overall I feel like this is the start of someone really talented. Overall great movie, sure to be something memorable 8/10",The Place Beyond the Pines
255,RolltheClip,"Rode like lightning, crashed like thunder.",7,26 March 2014,"Some say that actions speak louder than words. There are several actors capable of producing captivating performances simply by their demeanour and mannerisms. One of the aforementioned actors is Ryan Gosling, who skilfully balances the brooding, distant characteristics of a man struggling to provide for his family with the volatile persona he emits when in the midst of a bank robbery.Whilst he may look like a backstreet boy who's partied too hard, in actuality he is a skilled motorcyclist who spends his days travelling America with a Carnival, living very much off his own back. His clothes are further evidence of his wanderlust and impulsiveness that haunts him throughout the film.Upon returning to Schenectady, New York he discovers that a previous one night stand, Romina (Eva Mendes) has given birth to his son. In an attempt to do the right thing, he leaves behind his life of adventure to provide for his family, however, his inability to rekindle their relationship and the lack of funds soon cause him to resort to a life of crime.Initially offered work in a garage for pocket-change by a man named Robin, he is told of the owners previous skills in bank heists. The theme of family and blood run thick throughout this feature and it is for his newborn son, that he makes the offhand decision to accept. With a simple scheme and no apparent contingency plan, he becomes absorbed in the lifestyle and the money that comes as a result.In the same way that Kubrick would divide his works into two acts, The Place Beyond the Pines is divided into a three act structure. The first charting the rise and fall of Luke Glanton, his downfalls being his love of the chase in the pursuit of money for his broken family. He may have been a skilled biker, but when it came to the crunch, he was no criminal as he was shot by a rookie cop, Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper). Killing off one of your top-listed actors is a very bold move and it sets the scene for the rest of the film as the second segment shows the psychological trauma that Cross is left with, knowing that he has left a child without a father. Although he is proclaimed a hero, he has an unyielding problem with survivor's guilt when his colleagues take him to a surprise visit to see Romina and the baby, stealing Glanton's ransom money whilst he holds the dead mans child in his arms. In this moment, he is forced to look upon the ramifications of his action, along with the ugly reality of the corrupt workforce that he deals with. Subsequently, he dedicates himself to bringing them down so he can become assistant district attorney.The third and final act was undoubtedly the weakest, bringing a strong film to its knees as it goes through yet another identity crisis, sporadically changing between it's genres. As we time-lapse fifteen years after the initial incident, we meet both Jack and Avery's adolescent teenagers in high school, Jason and AJ. Unaware of the history between their parents, they both become close friends.Regardless of it not being shown on-screen, you realise that Avery's relationship with his wife had disintegrated several years prior, perhaps due to the common problem with people in the police struggling to ""switch off"" from the job. Along with his pursuit of a promotion, it's apparent that he neglected AJ as he was growing up, explaining his very 'ghetto'/anti-police persona.Not only does this film touch upon the theme of family, I believe that the final segment of the film explores the Nature vs Nurture debate. Where Cross' child, AJ grew up in the absence of a father figure, perhaps he turned to drugs in an attempt to get some form of attention off his dad.On the other hand, when Jason discovers his father's identity and the links to AJ, they have a fight where he ends up hospitalised. Hell-bent for revenge, Jason enters their home and forces Avery to drive into the woods at gunpoint, intent on killing him and repaying the debt. Was this in his nature? Was he born to reach this point? Nevertheless, when Cross breaks down and apologises for the death of Jason's dad, it absolves the situation as a near seventeen year-long issue is resolved and both are able to move on with their lives.On paper, this sounds like a well crafted conclusion to the film, yet it was rife with bad acting and plot holes. I just couldn't connect to AJ as he swaggers about looking like another 90′s boy band tragedy and overall, the plot went down a path which I wasn't really interested in taking as it seemed slightly too far-fetched and coincidental. Although the film makes some rather daring decisions, much like its troubled anti-hero, it didn't feel like the writers fully thought through their plans.Still, despite its flaws, the director, Cianfrance certainly had an eye for capturing those fleeting moments of happiness, along with the contrasting despair reminiscent of a Greek tragedy and acting that is,on the most part, commendable when accompanied by the stunning cinematography that chases them through the places beyond the pines.",The Place Beyond the Pines
256,codyjamesmiller,Can't believe I just found out about this movie,10,1 July 2020,Great full circle movie... 3 part saga that made the movie cool and different. Don't understand all the 1 Star reviews. I highly recommend watching this flick... Great stuff!,The Place Beyond the Pines
257,imdb-783-507847,A haunting quality with a power and intensity that impresses,9,4 September 2013,"Gosling is Luke, a bleach blonde drifter and high-wire motorcycle performer who moves from town to town with a travelling carnival. He shares a connection with former lover Romina (an unglamorous Eva Mendes) but his world is turned upside down when he realises that she's had his son while he's been gone.With a new family thrust upon him, Luke throws in the adoration of the crowds and the uncertain lifestyle of the carny to try and provide for them. But Romina believes he's unstable and despite Luke's efforts, rejects his push to provide.Working as a car mechanic, Luke's thrust into the world of crime by his boss (played by Animal Kingdom's Ben Mendelsohn) and takes part in a string of bank robberies. But that puts him on a direct collision course with cop Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper) and sees their lives intertwined in ways they could never imagine as the tale unfolds.the film swells into three interrelated stories, beginning with that of stunt biker Luke (Ryan Gosling), confronted after a performance by a young woman, Romina (Eva Mendes), he met on a previous tour through this dusty, forgettable outpost.Though there is much mystery about Romina, there's an undeniable magnetic pull for Luke and curious about this fleeting affair that might have amounted to more, he hangs around, especially after discovering her young child is tied to him by blood. He feels impelled to stay and perform peripheral parental duties but has neither the social skills to ingratiate himself into Romina's good graces nor negotiate the mine field her current relationship with new flame Kofi (Mahershala Ali) poses.The Place Beyond The Pines is a film whose three rich narrative strands don't get pulled together until the final third – and when the realization comes, it's devastating. Beautifully shot, compellingly acted by all those within, it defies expectations as this generational tale of fathers and sons slowly reveals its hand.As his displayed to stunning effect in Drive (2010), Gosling has the ability to convey deep emotions and impressions without uttering a single word: a portentous gaze, the ominous ebb in a conversation – these are treated as means to stress his character's non-verbal, intuitive reading of events. Flawed reasoning may ensue, leading to an eventual downfall like that of the enigmatically cool Driver in Nicolas Winding Refn's stunning film, but Gosling's directness of gaze and startling magnetism are now valuable assets for any filmmakers utilising his multi- faceted appeal.The focus of the second part of the film's then shifts to a police officer caught up in the preceding case. Played by Bradley Cooper, Avery fights both internal and external demons: his wife (an underused Rose Byrne) is desperate for him to leave the force, whilst some less than scrupulous colleagues, headed by Ray Liotta's Deluca, would like to steer him down a path that illegally exploits his recently acquired but unwanted fame.In conclusion I really enjoyed this movie, it has a power and intensity that impresses. It has a haunting quality which endures and is a drama which is weighty, compelling, intriguing and an insightful. It gives a reminder of the bonds which tie us together long into our years.For more check out: www.thefilmpodcast.co.uk or listen to our podcast On iTunes ('Search 'Filmsploitation') or Stitcher.",The Place Beyond the Pines
258,frasif00,The movie that moviechoholics long for a long long time,9,19 June 2013,"A Place After a long long time I am being compelled to write a review on some movie, and thats this. U can easily call this one beautiful piece of a multi layered movie. the Dark and Gothic vibe of this one gave me chill big time ! This story is told in three phases . One robber,one cop and their sons .Rayan gosling successfully tore down his good boy image a long time ago, but outdid himself in this particular character as a hard boiled tattoo covered stuntman come bank-robber, on the other-hand an emotional and affectionate father. In the second face comes the Hangover star 'Bradly Cooper'. Hangover revived his career, no doubt in that, but recently he is showing his true class and ultimate potential. He is also tore between his ambition and being honest which is caused by grief. Then comes the third phase of the movie including their sons, their legacy. This is the most significant part of the movie . The ending proves how the son become their fathers, completing the circle of their ultimate destiny. No one can avoid that. Eva Mendez did a great role, Ray Liyotta as a dirty cop performed a good score too.To me, the outstanding success pf this movie is its Background score and Gothic atmosphere. One of the best art-house movie of recent times after Gosling's 'Drive'. The deep and intense character study was spectacular. Derek Cianfrance's The Place Beyond The Pines is undoubtedly a visual odyssey, if nothing else. This film is about,is legacy, and passing the torch from generation to generation. This is the movie that movie choholics long for a long long time .",The Place Beyond the Pines
259,squeerelist,The unfortunate meeting of an oddly-tattooed biking Ryan Gosling and the tortured rookie cop Bradley Cooper,8,10 June 2013,"Derek Cianfrance strikes again with The Place Beyond the Pines. After releasing his masterpiece Blue Valentine, an analysis of the natural evolution of the on-screen couple Gosling-Williams, Cianfrance worked with his friend and acting muse Gosling for this story on 2 father-and- son relationships. Gosling is Luke, a stunt biker for a nomad amusement park. When he learns he had a son from a previous one-night-stand with Eva Mendes' character, he quits and tries to do his best to help raising the kid. Even if this implies robbing a few banks on the way. On one of his illegal rides, he crosses the path of rookie cop Bradley Cooper who will put an end to it all... Let's talk about the stunning cast for a minute. Luke will certainly become soon enough the idol of a generation like De Niro's Taxi Driver back in the day. With his odd tattoos, special skills and strong will to change his life for his son, it is again a truly intense and honest portrayal worthy of Gosling's talent. Eva Mendes has rarely been so true and raw: we definitely want to see more of her in such roles. Bradley Cooper doesn't stop surprising us either. After Silver Linings Playbook and his remarkable role as Pat, this is yet another milestone in his career. Let's hope he will stop acting in rubbish Hollywood blockbusters like The Hangover and stick to roles worthy of his skills. Derek Cianfrance is an astonishing director. Dealing with real-life topics and minimizing the glamor of his actors to focus on emotions, he's definitely one of the best things that has happened to 21st-century US cinema. His shots are often genius but simple. He doesn't rush or complicate plots and leaves an open door to improvisation. Cianfrance's tales are never intricate: he bases the development of his movies on his characters' psychology and behavior. Whoever said that 'less is more' was probably talking about such movies.1 reason to watch: Derek Cianfrance's epic long takesRead it here: http://squeerelist.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-place-beyond- pines-2013.html",The Place Beyond the Pines
260,javold,A Father Son Triptych,8,10 August 2013,"This is a movie about fathers and sons. There are all too brief glimpses of wives, a mother, a daughter/sister and a stepfather —the last painted with broad strokes to be a strong character but, sadly, never fully developed —but there are three stories in this film that come together and share the theme brilliantly: an elder father and his impressionable adult son; that son, years later, and his prodigal child; and another father and son who barely, yet indelibly, get to know one another. It would be enough, perhaps, to have just one of these stories. The first one, of a judge who steers his son into politics in a do or die moment, hints at an L.A. Confidential plot, and while the direction and writing are not quite of the same caliber, this story has its own intrigue. The second, of a son who divorces and pursues a public career and all but forgets his own child and his father's example, is also compelling and well acted by veteran Brad Cooper and newcomer Emory Cohen. The third, of a son who grew up not knowing his father and a father who lived and died thinking only of his son, is the most wrenching of the stories, and this one, too, with motorcycle and money motifs, scenes from the circus and parries into the worlds of crime and drugs, could stand alone. But instead we get the stories in the form of a triptych.Triptychs (Greek for threefold) are usually considered in the artistry of paintings (e.g. Hieronymus Bosch) or photography, with three panels presented side by side, but the term can also apply to films in which three separable plot lines are offered. And what better way to present this theme? After all, we who are fathers are also sons, and we fathers and sons will always be in parallel with others who walk the same path. This could, of course, get quite profound (the either/or dilemma of Abraham, Isaac, God and all future generations comes to mind) or muddled (see Bosch's depictions of Hell) and in the world of film triptychs could quickly trip up on the trickery of it, but The Place Beyond the Pines manages to make it work, maybe because it is neither as deep as Kierkegaard nor as detail heavy as the paintings of Bosch. There is not a complicated weave and we are not bogged down with imagery or allusions or heavy thought: we are simply given three examples, side by side, of the instance and pull of the father and son relationship.There is more I would have liked to have seen in this film. I mentioned the stepfather. I could also complain about some of the pacing or a few plot contrivances or some of the unoriginality of the direction. What prevails, though, is the way the film captures the fundamentals of its theme: the duty of fathers, the humanness of sons and the destinies we struggle to find.",The Place Beyond the Pines

263,Buscatcher,Don't read this go watch the movie!,10,21 April 2013,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, all the more I think for knowing nothing at all about it beforehand. So STOP reading NOW and go watch. Even with a ridiculous bleached blonde hair-do Ryan Gosling looks cool (the swine) here he plays Luke a motorbike stunt rider in a travelling show. Enjoying a gal in each town the big top pulls up at; how can they resist the chain smoking, tattooed, rippling muscled beauty..... anyway back to the plot. Luke discovers one of his conquests Romina - Eva Mendes is the mother of his little boy so decides to leave the show, settle down and support the child. He is befriended by Robin played by the superb (as always) Ben Mendelsohn who takes Luke under his wing offering him a bed in a trailer and a bit of work in his not very busy workshop. Robin tells Luke of his prior exploits in robbing banks at which the duo pair up as a bank robbing duo. After a bit of a falling out Luke robs a bank on his own, during his escape he is cornered in a house by a cop, Avery - Bradley Cooper. We then follow Bradley Cooper's character the son of a cop, also a beat police officer who is a law graduate who although has a good heart and soul is also ultra ambitious. We follow his character over the next fifteen years as he makes his way up the political food chain and are introduced to his brattish son Avery Jr played by rising star Emory Cohen. Emory is a chip off the old block when it comes to getting what he wants but with none of the compassion of his old man. He befriends and ultimately betrays Jason - Dane DeHaan (another gifted young actor) a fellow student purely it seems to make him his drug gopher/fall guy. Its these two characters who lead us to a well polished and for me satisfying end to a great film. I have tried to outline the plot with as little spoiling as possible because as I stated at the start the least known the better. Written and Directed by Derek Cianfrance who also performed those duties on the superb Blue Valentine. The direction is tight and I felt in a state of anticipation and suspense throughout. Their are some breathtaking one take set pieces that still manage to maintain a great aesthetic quality as does the entire film. Go catch the bus and see this its a rare 10/10 from the Buscatcher. Enjoy.",The Place Beyond the Pines
264,tj0331,Incredible film!!,10,2 May 2013,Derek Cianfrance has exceeded his own previous work with Place Beyond the Pines. It is a compliment by all means as his breakthrough feature Blue Valentine was very impressive. I mention this to say that if you are a fan then you will be more than impressed with this latest from Cianfrance. I think the way the film is executed is with the precision and grace of a seasoned veteran. The raw elements mixed with a specific set of camera styles give this an outstanding feel and look all the way through. Trying not to really give anything away here but what most impressed me was the layout of the story as it unfolds in three major acts. It is not often in film at all that the viewer gets to be thrown into a long stretching story that actually has a sense of constant continuity. I will be regarding this as a new favorite along with some legendary cinema. I hope the film earns the respect and even the awards it well deserves.,The Place Beyond the Pines
265,gemini_dremz,Incredible Story,10,11 January 2014,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film because it got a lot of mixed reviews from people I know, so I was a little apprehensive about seeing it. On that note, I'm glad I did and I would definitely recommend it.All the characters are entwined and the story comes full circle which I liked. Personally, I liked the actors chosen for the parts they played. Bradley Cooper always seems like the sweet, honest do-gooder and Ray Liotta, well he's a great bad guy. I loved Ryan Gosling as Luke, I don't think anyone else would've done that role justice. Dane DeHaan was most impressive as Jason.When you watch this, you find yourself cheering for Luke and wanting Avery Cross to be punished, but by the end of the film, you feel compassion for Avery especially when Jason finds the photo of his family in Avery's wallet. In the end when you see Jason ride off in his newly purchased bike, knowing he is trying to be like his father, you know the story has come full circle.I found it to be a compelling story of tragedy, morality, denial, greed and desperation.",The Place Beyond the Pines
266,January39,"Great film, subtle & engaging.",9,3 October 2013,"Just watched this and I have to tell you, it's very good.It would be easy to think that it is about bike chases and bank robberies, to a degree it is but it also tells a greater story about cause & effect, ripples through time and how every action has a reaction now and in the future.It is told in one film but it feels more like 3 and each segment could be a whole new film, in it's own right, the cast all do a good job, although for me Ryan Gosling gives the best performance and you really empathise with his character, almost to the point you forgive his sins.It is quite long and does slow a little midway but it is never boring, a thinking persons film.I enjoyed it and I think it will stay with me for quite some time...A justified 9/10",The Place Beyond the Pines
267,ravechildglasgow,A significant improvement though still not the great film that we all seem to be waiting for from Cianfrance,7,22 April 2013,"The new Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine) flick has been acquiring much buzz and anticipation and it's easy to see why with the Gos at the helm.Full disclosure, I found Blue Valentine muddled and largely unsympathetic, and I'm still on the fence about whether Ryan Gosling is actually an actor or just a piece of eye-candy.Anyway, my interest certainly piqued at this new feature, and it was a significant improvement though still not the great film that we all seem to be waiting for from Cianfrance.Much like Blue Valentine, this focuses on the class system of the state of his native New York, and there are some breathtaking moments and scenery to be had, akin to the master Terence Malick.Without going into spoilers, this film is at its best in its structure.This almost becomes its own undoing when it lingers just a little too long in certain scenes (one thing I did like Blue Valentine for) and begins to drag – particularly in the final third act – but it's refreshing to see a young director take a chance within the triptych form... www.ravechild.co.uk",The Place Beyond the Pines
268,michaelsharples96,"""If you ride like lightening. You're gonna crash like THUNDER""",8,16 May 2015,"'The Place Beyond the Pines' is a crime/drama starring Ryan Gosling (Notebook, Drive), Bradley Cooper (Silverlinings: Playbook), Eva Mendes (Hitch, Training Day) and Dane Dehaan (Chronicle). Written and directed by Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine)This movie is about fathers, sons and consequences and how the choices you make will shape your life over the years to come.It is a movie respectively divided into 3 acts, like most movies. But what this one does is more like creating 3 separate movies and subtly combining them into one. And very well, might I add.The first act follows Luke (Gosling) a motorbike stunt rider who meets Romina (Mendes) after finishing one of his shows and they spend the night together. Lucas then disappears only to come back a year later to find out that he has fathered child, but he doesn't exactly have much in ways of taking care of him and decides to do something about. He meets up with Robin, (Ben Mendelsohn, Dark Knight Rises) the owner of a junk yard, as he needs a job. The junk yard isn't where his money comes in. The pair decide to rob banks. After a while Luke starts to get a little greedy and he bites off more than he can chew, so to speak. This lead onto multiple events that set the rest of the movies tone.The second act of the movie leads into more of police drama that builds off the consequences from the fist act. It delves into police corruption and Avery (Cooper) is caught right in the middle of it, but he wants it to stop.The camera-work in this movie is some of the most beautifully shot and directed I've ever seen. Like long takes of Luke riding on a long winding road accompanied by an equally beautiful score from Mike Patton. It really sets the tone for the whole movie and you really know you're in for a treat. It might be deemed a bit boring for some, but to those that can appreciate it will fall in love with this movie. Not only the score but even the soundtrack in this movie just flows perfectly and intertwines with all the correct scenes.The third act of the movie features Luke's son, Jason (Dehaan). He's a teenager that had trouble identifying with himself, which is why he was misguided into doing things such as drugs and crime. You can't escape who you are from your genetics, but you always have a choice. A choice that can make or break you as you progress further in life. For Jason the right choice will bring him a brighter future, a future that will bring him to the right place. A place away from the sins of his father, a place beyond the pines.",The Place Beyond the Pines
269,nonprofitgnome1,A Very Unique Journey,9,11 August 2013,"The Place Beyond the Pines is easily one of the most unique films I have seen in quite some time. It is structured almost like a play in that it has 3 very distinct acts. Despite these different ""acts"", the director Cianfrance is able to make it all mesh into an excellent film.In act one we have have Ryan Gosling absolutely stealing the show. Gosling's character finds out he has a son and turns to a life of crime to support him. There's obviously more to this first act but I want to leave it unspoiled and honestly the only thing you need to know is that Gosling does an amazing job. He is in my opinion one of the most talented actors in Hollywood. His characters always seem so layered. Once again, the guy you see on the outside doesn't match they guy on the outside.Act two, while still tied loosely to act one, revolves around Bradley Cooper and his trials as a cop. Admitadley this part was a lot slower than the opening but it never lost my interest. There was definitely a different pace but I felt it was still acted well and served to set up the final act.The final act is where Cianfrance ties the lives of Gosling's character to that of Cooper's and how their meeting has affected both their families lives. In my opinion it wasn't a huge twist out of left field but it was a very satisfying final act.The Place Beyond the Pines was beautifully directed and the acting was top notch. There were some slow points (this is why I gave the movie and 9 and not a 10) but I personally didn't mind them. If your looking for a great journey through two mens lives I would definitely check this movie out. It's such a fresh take on a pretty normal plot that it really has me waiting in anticipation for Derek Cianfrance's next movie",The Place Beyond the Pines
270,hkfilmbuff,Less than satisfactory,6,20 February 2014,"I happened to like both Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper, and both of them put in a good performance. However, the story is just not compelling enough, nor totally believable. What kind of corrupt cops would try to set up the son of a judge? Granted he was supposed to be a rookie, but a rookie with a law degree! And given the obvious discomfort and hesitancy of the supposed pawn, how did he ever manage to pull off that sting operation?The first of 3 ""acts"" was by far the best. Yes, people living at the ""fringe"" can still have a conscience, showing decency and goodness, even though they have been dealt a bad hand. A similar theme underlies the director's other collaboration with Gosling in ""Blue Valentine"", which I like much better than this one.Worth mentioning is the character of Jake (I think, the one who took Luke in and brought him into the bank robbery capers in the first place). He tried to stop Luke from destroying himself, but who could stop a runaway train?",The Place Beyond the Pines

272,CobraLaLaLa,This Movie was horrible!!!,1,22 April 2013,"Where do I begin. The plot was all over the place. What started out as something promising, turn into a sloppy mess. I honestly wanted to leave after about 1 hr, basically after Ryan Gosling was killed. Only went to the movie to see him perform, as I like this acting capabilities. Have nothing against Bradley Cooper, but I did not see the movie to see him act. The movie was very misleading, as they new Ryan was the draw, and for him to be out more then half of the movie, was absolutely unacceptable to ANYONE who went to see him in this movie. Character development was very poor. Did not feel the least bit for Bradley Cooper, Eva Mendez, or Ryan Goslings character. As a matter of fact, the Bradley Cooper's son in the movie, was probably the character I disliked the most. He couldn't act for one, totally unbelievable, had all the privileges a kid could hope for, but yet acted like he was a tough kid from the streets! Ryan Goslings son can't fight. Got all the attitude in the world, but wasn't able to throw one punch when he had to. Did not feel sorry for him either. He was raised in a 2 parent working middle class home. With an emotional wreck for a Mother, but a strong hard working Father. But somehow, even he turns out with severe emotional problems. There was no bright spot or successful character through out this whole film. When people died, you really didn't care, because they weren't really good people to began with. I felt bad for the Step dad for what Ryan's character did, as he was about the only decent individual in the film. They tried tying the stories together, but the character development was so poor, I could care less how the stories were connected, I was also still steamed that Ryan Goslings character got killed off 40 minutes in. Bottom line, if your looking for or expecting a movie about a guy who robs banks on his bike to support his son and wife\girlfriend, you will only find this is the case for 40 minutes of movie time. After that, the movie becomes a different movie, involving new characters for the most part. This movie was misleading, poorly written, and the overall acting was not up to par, mainly I believe due to miscasting. Oh btw, Ryan's son never learned how to ride a bike, so him riding off at the end on the motorcycle was complete b.s.",The Place Beyond the Pines

But I believe I have just a movie that reaches into that category. For one thing, there just has not been a recent movie or any movie since American Beauty that has reached so deeply into the spirit of a broken, violent and twisted country like ours. And this film rips away any pretense of making things look better than they do. At the same time each scene is filled with emotion. The acting. direction, camera work and screen writing is all to notch. But beyond all of this, is a tale that rings so very true on every level.I will write more, but for now. please do not miss this. We may have a damaged and tragic country.

274,i-Shuvo,An epic exploring a fascinating and profound concept,9,22 April 2013,"In The Place Beyond the Pines, Cianfrance is painting with the same emotional palate as 'Blue Valentine', but on a much larger canvas. Running almost two and a half hours, Pines is a melodrama, multi-generational epic, heist film, and motorcycle-fetish movie all rolled into one. Arguably, it's a bit overambitious, but good God, look at Gosling! He doesn't sing. He doesn't need to. He is a ripped, inked, peroxided carny-cum-bandit, the erstwhile front-man of ""Handsome Luke and the Heartthrobs,"" a travelling troupe of motorcycle acrobats who ride crisscross and upside down in a metal cage called the ""Globe of Death."" Cianfrance has described Luke as the kind of guy the Shangri-Las used to sing about, and indeed, he radiates tragic gutter glory. In a series of spectacular single-take chase scenes, the film follows Luke's descent. The deeper he goes, the more we mourn the ""Leader of the Pack."" Be warned that all the action and excitement (i.e., all the Gosling) is front-loaded. Pines develops as a triptych, and its tonal shifts are sometimes disorienting. In part one, Luke learns that his last fling in Schenectady has led to the birth of a son by Romina (Mendes). He quits the carnival in an effort to woo her, and when that doesn't work, he starts robbing banks. With his lovelorn gaze and ill-gotten cash, he comes close to winning her back, but then he gets cocky and bungles a stickup – crossing paths with an ambitious rookie cop, Avery (Cooper), who's the subject of the film's second story.Without giving too much away, Luke and Avery are mirrored souls (in close-up, Cooper and Gosling look surprisingly alike) celebrated for their courage but beset with secret cowardice. Both feel guilty for their failures as fathers and sons, and both try to correct bad mistakes with worse ones, setting in motion unintended consequences for the next generation. (Dads just can't win in Cianfrance's movies.) Part three leaps forward 15 years to find their teenage sons in a star-crossed showdown.If Valentine's fractured, nonlinear narrative helped obscure a thin plot, Pines' straightforward chronological march seems to emphasise the same problem. Perhaps Pines would work better as a cable series; I wanted to spend more time riding around Schenectady with Luke and Avery, just watching their day-to-day activities. With so many people and ideas flying around (and the fussy imperative of having to actually end the story), the contrivances start piling up. Yet these flaws seem like mere stumbling blocks for this emerging auteur. The film is so velvety textured and dreamy, I would've stuck around for more. That is Cianfrance's special talent.",The Place Beyond the Pines

It also has a dark, moody quality to it; the kind where you really feel the characters' pain. The cinematography and music create a really evocative ""mood"".The film is split into three clear acts, and it follows four main characters. One of them is touring funfair motorbike rider Luke, played by Ryan Gosling, who discovers he has a baby at the start of the film. Another is good-guy-but-troubled cop Avery, played by Bradley Cooper, who has a son of the same age. Later, we meet their sons.Technically, there isn't a huge amount of ""plot"" or action going on, and yet it always feels like something is happening as there's a huge amount of tension and a sense of things unravelling. You get the sense that some of the characters are trying to make the best of bad circumstances, while others manipulate the circumstances to get what they want.The film plays with the notions of good vs. Bad, cop vs. Villain, rich vs. Poor, powerful vs. Powerless, and other dichotomies. The outcome is that you can't guess what is going to happen next and there are some truly shocking moments. I first saw this film at the cinema and when one of these moments occurred, there was an audible gasp across the cinema as nobody had seen it coming.So, why did I give it a 9 and not a 10, you might wonder? Well, I am a big fan of this film, but the finale is a little too fast for me. I wanted five more minutes of wrapping up as Romina and AJ's threads feel hastily dealt with. But other than that, a stellar film.",The Place Beyond the Pines
276,jamfitz001,The Place Beyond the Pines: where you find Bear turds,2,4 July 2013,"Yikes. What a stinker.As You may understand, this movie is comprised of a first part that follows a brooding loner who says nothing and rides a motorcycle in a carnival as he decides to stay in town to support his love-child and attempts to win back his now-moved on fling. The movie begins to get interesting when he starts to rob banks and has some well-done heist/getaway scenes. But then all of a sudden he's gone, and you follow the cop that took him down for some reason, and he plays his cards pretty well and just when you are thinking, where is this going, is it done...well then they say ""15 Years Later"" and they start a new story right at the point you were hoping you could leave. And it goes on a while more about the sins of the fathers being passed on to the sons, and nothing much happens really, and then it just ends.The pretentiousness of the story is over-shadowed by it's contrived nature. Sure, this cold happen. After all, that guy went fishing thirty years later and found his lost wedding ring in the fishes belly, didn't he? Ryan Gosling repeats the one note he plays, a goofy-faced smirking Disney Kid grown up, roided out, and vamping on a Steve McQueen Imitation. Eva Mendes doesn't really have much to do, and has been much better in other movies. Bradley Cooper is a take-or-leave mediocrity ala Matt Damon. Not horrible, but not impressive. The young kids at the end act their precious little hearts out, but they are cast in stereotyped roles (the rich-boy smug punk playing hard, the brooding troubled misfit).The movie is long, and except for the well-done 15 minutes of bank robbery and chase scenes, it just meanders. The soundtrack is forgettable. Here's the point: don't knock up strange chicks and then start robbing banks, your kid will be f'd up, and a bunch of bad crap will happen and nobody but the lonely guy who let you stay in his trailer will think any good thoughts about you.",The Place Beyond the Pines
277,kriddirk,"3 Stories in 1, where from only 1 is OK",5,14 September 2013,"I read in some reviews done by professional press that this movie was one describing the life of several generations affected by one event, one crime. I missed that one. We have 3 stories, which could have been 3 movies, linked by a family threat which is not necessary. It seems the director has put this link in the movie just to go from one to another story, but there is no reason to be there. The why of the link in each part and why the family ties develop like this is independent of the origin. The first part of the movie is very good, action part, good plot, emotional situation, etc ... all played excellent by Ryan Gosling (Luke) and Eva Mendes (Romina). The start promises a fantastic movie, one of the better ones. The next part, the police part and corruption, we saw so many times in other TV series and movies. This part does not get any chance to develop itself, there is no time to do so. Bradley Cooper does really his best to accomplish, but fails due to the poor script. Then the latter part is again another movie about the problems of children ( drugs, divorced parents ) and there so busy parents. There is a link between the 3 stories, which is obvious. I felt as I didn't saw any movie, no subject, missing some depth in any story.The movie takes over 2 hours ( and it could be 3 ) and ends up by a stop sign given to the director some 5 minutes before the end.Rated a 5 due to the fantastic roles of Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes in the first 30 minutes ( first part ).",The Place Beyond the Pines
278,MediaboyMusings,"A phenomenal first segment, then it's all downhill",6,1 October 2012,"The Place Beyond The Pines derives its title from the English translation of the Mohawk name for Schenectady, New York, where the film is set. Director Derek Cianfrance's third feature is the follow-up to 2010's widely praised Blue Valentine, a movie whose supposed magnificence was lost on me. Cianfrance reteams with one of that film's stars, Ryan Gosling, for one of The Place Beyond The Pines' three segments that unfolds over a 15 year period with interconnected story lines that mixes elements of crime drama, teenage angst, questions about fate, and the complexities of father-son relationships.The first segment is unquestionably the film's strongest, with Gosling further refining the brooding anti-hero character that seems to have become his stock-in- trade. His Luke character is introduced in the film's great opening scene that employs an extensive single tracking shot, as the audience views his heavily tattooed body and carnival motorcycle stunt rider profession, which convey Luke's societal fringe elements without saying a word. Luke's white trash status is also reinforced by the repeated wearing of a Metallica Ride The Lightning muscle tee and a ratty white t-shirt worn inside out in public, tag and all (I love that the latter is never addressed by any characters Luke meets). A reconnection with a woman (Romina, played by a solid Eva Mendes) he had a quickie fling with the last time his job brought him to town reveals that he's the father of her two-year old son. The news awakens Luke's paternal instincts and he attempts to insert himself back into the pair's lives, despite the complication of another man in Romina's life. Desperate to prove he can provide for Romina and his son, Luke ends up robbing banks, with the assistance of a scruffy auto mechanic he's met (an excellent Ben Mendelsohn providing some understated comic relief). Aspects of Luke and his deeds immediately bring to mind Gosling's role from last year's Drive. Despite the similarities in roles surprisingly played so close to each other, Gosling's unpredictable, violence-prone character commands the screen for the approximately hour long length of his segment. His storyline does admittedly benefit from the best writing of the three segments, courtesy of screenwriters Cianfrance, Ben Coccio, and Darius Marder.Gosling's dynamism and that first segment's brilliance are only highlighted by the significantly diminishing returns that follow it. Segment two stars Bradley Cooper as a rookie cop who found himself involved in Luke's story, with other subplots involving police corruption, morality, and an unhappy marriage also playing out. I've always found Cooper to be a rather dull actor and his performance here hasn't changed my opinion; that, combined with the segment's derivative story, managed to effectively kill my segment one buzz. The writing is also too uneven - Cooper's character is set up as a smart, moral person, yet those qualities are a little too conveniently discarded when he's presented with a career-altering decision. Bruce Greenwood is memorable in a small role as a high-ranking cop, while Ray Liotta's minor role as an intimidating, crooked cop feels like the kind of role we've seen from him dozens of times already.Segment three completes The Place Beyond The Pines' downhill slide, focussing on the teenage sons (played by Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen) of Gosling's and Cooper's characters. As the snoozy storyline featuring bratty behaviour from the screwed up high school students developed, I could never get past the fact the segment hinged on their chance meeting and eventual friendship. That meeting, considering the inextricably linked history they share via their fathers, was simply far too coincidental for me to suspend disbelief. Also distracting: a time jump of 15 years reveals Cooper's character and that of his wife (played by Rose Byrne) to have seemingly not aged at all, while Mendes' Romina looks to have aged about 25 years.I respect the fact that Cianfrance took some risks with The Place Beyond The Pines, which had its world premiere at TIFF - he throws in a major plot twist relatively early on and the movie's segmented structure is definitely a gamble and somewhat unconventional, but unfortunately, the loosely connected narrative and performances don't hold together over the course of the film's too-long 140 minute running time. The disappointing ending shouldn't come as much of a shock to anyone who has just witnessed the decline from the first-rate quality of the riveting opening segment to the progressively inferior chapters that follow. As the last third of it plays out, that swing has been so dramatic that it almost feels like we're watching an altogether different movie.",The Place Beyond the Pines
279,mikekisil,Derek Cianfrance- the heir to John Sayles.,9,22 April 2013,"I'd heard so much about this film that I was fully prepared for crushing disappointment. I'd watched ""Blue Valentine"" and wondered if Derek Cianfrance was a one-shot wonder. So the film started and would it be 140 minutes of missed opportunities. First shot, Ryan Gosling's perfect ""abs"". Soon after Eva Mendes's nipples completely unfettered - where was this film going? And yet... I'd recently watched John Sayles's ""Lone Star"" and was struck by many themes that they had in common - sins of the fathers having an impact on the sons, doing the ""right thing"" even when under pressure. This was a similar picture of small town life that was not as doom-laden as the stories of Cornell Woolrich or Jim Thompson. Unlike other films that I had viewed that purported to show a slice of real Americana - the rubbish ""Spring Breakers"" still brings on nightmares - these people were just simply trying to play the hand Fate had dealt them the best they could. 140 minutes just flashed by. The story enfolded me and did not let me go until the credits came up. I have despaired that texture, coherence and storytelling skills are absent from the current crop of American filmmakers but Derek Cianfrance as director and co-writer is to be treasured and nurtured. His actor-management skills are superb and bring out the best in his players the way Mike Leigh does with his. Not only that, his control of the photography and choice of music shows a talent that is beginning to hit its stride. All the actors contribute as an ensemble. The headliners - Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper and Eva Mendes - show that their talent continues to grow. Rose Byrne in an all-too-brief appearance plays an effective supporting role. Even the old warhorses Harris Yulin, Ray Liotta and Bruce Greenwood show what skillful actors they are during their fleeting time on screen. And as someone to watch for the future, watch out for Dane DeHaan - a young man with major potential. Choice of music is important throughout the film. Check out the scene where Gosling watches his son being baptised in church. I was not the only one shedding a tear in the audience. Finally, major credit to all the members of the makeup department. The talent it took to thoroughly de-glamourise a hot babe like Mendes - it is Oscar-worthy !!",The Place Beyond the Pines

Equally the performances from the cast are exceptional with both Gosling and Bradley Cooper putting in standout performances. The plot does real you in and produces a number of interesting surprises across its three acts, although the third act does drag a touch and suffers in comparison to the first two.

283,gmc1-823-758803,"One of the worst films of the last few decades; it warns 'if you tolerate this, then your children will be next.'",1,20 January 2014,"In short, and not wanting to be impolite or offensive, though, this film is a pile of excrement. It's unbelievably bad, trite, lowest formula writing, and the whole mindset of everything in the making never transcends that depth (a limit of depth point, bear in mind).An exception may be the acting of young DeHaan near the end, a short piece, and the cinematography he seemingly manages to command. As if the makers had seen the light at him, in their hallucinating tiredness. This tiny meadow of cinematic relief comes close to the end of producing this 2 hr 20 minute near epic from the really worst, disgusting, killer patch of story & popular culture trash heap land. Perhaps, even more than ""Drive"" (2011), it could have been intended at some time by the writer to expose the global cinema and disc audiences as gullible, brainless phoneys of humanoids, largely. If so, looks like it has succeeded, largely. However, unlike ""Drive"" there's no tenable, mature, serious element or message as of the story itself.I think the only merit in experiencing this film may be to realise that how the very worst made-for-TV films ever can yet tower over much hyped Hollywood big screen fodder such as this. It's so, so bad.Who cares about any element of the plot for those who want to say it talks about modern social issues, making them timeless in a Greek tragedy style? No, instead, this film only seems in some way to suggest an explanation of why society can have been so apathetic to wrongs in administration, law and politics. If real life would be anything like this truly abysmal film, all apathy and positively blinding oneself to unacceptable elements of society becomes instantly understandable, obvious, even the wise solution.But I wouldn't be here typing this if life could be mirrored even distantly accurately by this awful film, I hope. If there was never any attention to make truly any creation which may reflect, comment upon or bear a resemblance to reality, and the intention was for pure, base, escapist entertainment, I can't even see how 'The Place Beyond the Pines' even makes that at the lowest possible level. No, base in entertainment is a few light years above this absolute, prize, legendary drivel which can't even be taken quite seriously enough to bother calling very clichéd or absurdly remedial. You can call it those things if you want, though the film just doesn't warrant the attention due for that. It's a much, much, much worse film than those descriptions. Much, much, much, much, much, much worse.",The Place Beyond the Pines

No matter the circumstances. A bold movie with no lulls and some pretty good action. There are a couple of genres that this picture moves through. Making it an exciting and enjoyable feature to watch. Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper were great and Eva's character progressed beautifully. Mike Patton did the score which carried the film through it's long time line and added a certain atmosphere.

285,landinathome,Watching Paint Dry,1,4 May 2013,"The synopsis for this movie sounds so much more interesting than it actually is. There were no redeeming characters, no one was conflicted over anything, no one wanted to achieve anything in particular. There was no great passion, no inner turmoil, no big lesson to be learned, not much of anything at all. I'm not dense, and I do enjoy subtlety in a movie, but unfortunately this movie only hinted at possible conflicts that never actually made it to screen. The motorcycle rider quits his job when he learns that he has a kid. It's not a job he loves (but it could have been) and he doesn't particularly care about the girl (though it would have been more interesting if he did); she was just a one night stand from a year or two earlier and he never bothered to call her again. Had he been desperately looking for work, and finally resorted to robbing banks, it might have been interesting, but no, he robbed banks as a first resort and without great passion. Had the woman and her child been destitute, had they been victims of domestic violence, then you might have understood his desire to help them, but no, he just wanted to give them money (which they didn't particularly need).Had the cop been tortured by the fact that he lied about the shooting, had he been wanting to tell the truth but was conflicted; had he some inner demon sabotaging him throughout his life, then his story might have carried some weight, but no, he lived a normal life and advanced his career as one might do.Had the motorcycle rider's son been desperately seeking a father figure his whole life, then his discovery of the identity of the cop would have been dramatic, but no, he had a normal life with a loving step-father, and so the discovery was no big deal. But assuming it was a big deal (a very big assumption) you might have expected him to exact revenge with some clever plot, but no, he simply threatens to kill the guy (for no apparent reason) and then changes his mind at the last minuteof course.They missed the dramatic mark in every possible way. It was lazy writing to say the least. A movie has to actually create conflict and motivation, it can't leave it up to the audience to assume that people are conflicted, or that something matters to them. I think anyone who gave it a good review must have read way more into the movie than was actually there. Wish I'd walked out.

288,Catrician,Excellent,9,20 April 2013,"Ryan Gosling has been called many things over the years. ""Stud"". ""Overrated"". ""Talented"". ""Charismatic"". The list goes on. But I prefer the ""eternal saviour of indy cinema"" myself. While only about a third of Cianfrance's The Place Beyond the Pines focuses on Gosling directly, one can easily see his talent show as it brings this already beautiful film up to a higher level. Cianfrance, I've read, studied under legends of cinema, notably Stan Brakhage (who is considered to be the greatest American avant-garde director), and this shows. His use of scenery is reminiscent and perhaps pays homage to the films of Malick, and his use of shaky cam but additionally longshots brings forth his technical diversity and cinematic knowledge. The Place Beyond the Pines is quite possibly the best American film since Malick's own ""The Tree of Life"", which is a comparison I don't often make. Cooper, Gosling, and nigh every supporting character in the film are about as perfect as one can get, and the plot weaves believably throughout. Another aspect of the film that invited me was the symbolism, which seemed to not dominate the film as it often can (even with acclaimed masterpieces such as Gilliam's ""Brazil"") but it was subtle and unique; certainly a rarity in any age of cinema. As another difference to ""regular"" films, the characters were not perfect. However, directors have caught on to this trick recently, and have made perfect characters with one or two tragic flaws, whereas Cianfrance seems to reverse this, giving us not very appealing characters but that have one or two things that can make them, in essence, good people.Suspenseful, warm, but also harsh and relentless, The Place Beyond the Pines seems like an essential film that's just a little difficult to watch in places. I won't spoil anything for anybody, but I will say that if you're squeamish at all about violence on other people (and I'm not talking the Tarantino-esque violence that we're so used to), then stay away, find a Starbucks near you and have the time of your life. There is very, very little to complain about here. The problem is that the film's faults stand out like a normal person at WalMart. While the acting, cinematography, directing, and emotion is all superb, there's just so many scenarios where actors don't act like people. For example (minor spoiler alert), during one of the character's funeral for said character's father, the character in question is barely shown to be impacted emotionally at all, which is, well, out of character. If only Cianfrance could have fine-tuned this, then we would have an essential masterpiece on our hands.",The Place Beyond the Pines

It is a pretty straight-forward drama but it is done in a very unique way and tells a great story of how violence can affect everyone, fathers, mothers, and especially children. The performances are what really stand out in the film though. Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper are stellar. Its nice to see Cooper do the more dramatic roles after all of the Hangover movies. Eva Mendes really surprised me though. I've never been too impressed by her acting ability before but she was excellent in her role here. The other great part of the cast was Dane DeHaan. He really impressed me in Chronicle and did the same in Pines. I think he's a young, up-in-comer that we'll be hearing a lot more from in the future.The movie does have its flaws, but they are few and far between. My biggest gripe was the run time because the movie does drag, but everything else makes up for that. It was a beautifully shot film and not a bad performance at all from any of the actors. And Derek Cianfrance is definitely a director to look out for in the future. I also think some Oscar nods should come this movie's way, but since it come out earlier in the year, it may miss out, which is a shame.",The Place Beyond the Pines
293,whatalad,Too clichéd to be anything other than average,5,17 March 2013,"This review contains some plot details.The Place Beyond The Pines deserves praise for its ambition to weave together three stories linked to the same event in an art house style, however the only people who will walk away from this thinking it's anything more than a nice looking cliché are those who must have seen very few films.Director Derek Cianfrance's film suffocates under the weight of its own attempts to be an epic drama, spanning 15 years and three chapters in the lives of all involved. This is a perfect example of a film forcing itself to be something it's not; there is never enough character arc or substantial depth of character development to warrant the overbearing 150 minute running time.As mentioned, the film is complied of three stories, the first of which is easily the most accomplished section of the film, albeit far from original. We follow Luke (Ryan Gosling), a man with a violent history who now wants to care for Romina (Eva Mendes) and their baby boy whom she has kept a secret from him and now lives with another man. He turns to robbing banks in the small town of Schenectady, New York, and gives her some of the cash he steals. So, a man with the love of a woman in his heart jumps on to the desk at a bank and points a gun... Heat, Public Enemies, The Town, Point Blank have all told a similar story over two hours allowing the audience to invest in the characters, not cramming it into 30-odd minutes.The success of this section of the film comes not from the dialogue or set-up, but from the great performance by Ryan Gosling, channelling some of the brooding madman vibe we saw in Drive. Gosling is a very effective actor with this smaller, character-driven material and the difference between him here and in Gangster Squad couldn't be greater. Cianfrance also demonstrates both excellent and awful directorial decisions in this act; the opening tracking shot is tremendous as is a car/bike chase which shows a fantastic new way of capturing the action from inside the police car in a single take, but then Cianfrance ruins it all when the action goes hand-held and the shakycam comes out like Paul Greengrass with caffeine jitters.The transition from story one into story two introduces Bradley Cooper as cop Avery Cross in a delightfully matter-of-fact manner, not the way you'd usually expect to see a movie star introduced; he simply appears as a cop giving chase when Luke is attempting to get away from his latest bank robbery. This was a very nice touch.The second story, however, soon has little to do with the opening story. After events which won't get detailed here, the story goes into a police corruption scandal which is familiar to anyone who has seen a Sidney Lumet picture, Copland or even recent trash such as Pride and Glory. The film is now rapidly running out of steam as everything unfolding is a cliché of much better films (again, see Lumet's work) and the crime thriller aspect which was set-up in the opening third is now over and, essentially, a new film has begun, and we have to focus now on caring about Avery Cross. However, the corruption case is neatly resolved with no impact whatsoever on the characters or audience and then the dreaded '15 years later' title card appears.Fifteen years on and the third story begins, and the cliché machine goes into overdrive and The Place Beyond The Pines loses any interest it may have had left. Luke's son and Avery's son become friends! They both like drugs! They have both missed father figures in their journey to adulthood! But, remember everyone, AVERY KILLED Luke, so this new friendship surely won't fall apart within 30 minutes and one of the boys won't do a Google search on their father and throw away 17 years of good upbringing bar the occasional recreational drug indulgence to take revenge on the cop who is now running for District Attorney! Oh... yes it does and yes they do. It's just screen writing by connecting the dots and is wholly disengaging and uninteresting.This final story ultimately sums up The Place Beyond The Pines; trying making something out of nothing for there is really nothing under the surface. Crime thriller, corruption story, father and son Greek tragedy, revenge story, family drama; this film wants to be it all but ends up like a film adaptation of a 600 page novel which was never written. Shame, because it would probably make for a great novel as well.",The Place Beyond the Pines

This movie is about this biker guy who wants to get his girlfriend and son back. He starts robbing banks to make money for his family.
The cop who kills the biker guy. End of biker story marks the beginning of cop story.
Cop repents for killing the biker. He rats out his corrupt colleagues, but hides his mistake. For me movie should have ended here. That would have been apt. But it keeps going for no reason.15 years later, we see the story of two teens, sons of the cop and biker. This is where it gets weird. There aren't any strong emotional scenes. It just goes plain. We keep expecting that something is going to happen but nothing comes up. It's all nonsense from here. It becomes so irrelevant and the ending scene is slightly better, where sons try to become their fathers.",The Place Beyond the Pines

The trailer of this movie is misleading, I watched the movie thinking that it was another boring drama but I was so surprised when I watched it. The way the story was told was wonderful and kept the viewer wanting to know more about the characters. Dane DeHaane was amazing with every role he takes he proves that he's a talented actor and he has a good future ahead of him.The movie has a long running time which is two hours and a half but I didn't feel bored through the entire movie. The story was emotional and unpredictable. The characters are very well presented but you feel like the movie fell a part in the final act, the movie was so good and it definitely deserved a better ending.The cinematography in this movie was so beautiful. It made every scene look like a piece of art.

300,XanderDevil,Excellent Three-Part Story About the Ripple Effects of Crime,9,25 April 2013,"All I knew about The Place Beyond the Pines as I walked into the theater was that it was about a motorcycle stuntman robbing banks as a way to provide for his wife and young son. I found this movie a great example of a story that does not revolve around a singular character, but around a spree of crimes. This movie has three distinct narratives that take place, as the story follows three different characters. However, they all have to do with the bank-robbing spree of the initial protagonist.There are a lot of unexpected elements in this movie. The first narrative chance in the movie is very drastic. When it happens, it got me thinking ""Did that really just happen?"" I found myself to be shocked by the realism of the situation. The movie is so ominously realistic as it goes on that it almost gave me chills just thinking about it.The titular location, the place beyond the pines, refers to several locations. The literal meaning of the title indicates that the place is beyond some trees, either within the same woods or even beyond. The place beyond the pines is also the loose meaning of the city name Schenectady. The heavily wooded area, seen several times in the movie, is a place portrayed for as a path to redemption and death. Yet the city itself is a place where the characters define themselves through actions. The characters physically leave the city to go into the woods or beyond to be redeemed in one way or another, yet they never leave the same place symbolically. Figuratively, they stay in the same place they were before. The story comes full circle, since the protagonist that the story follows at the end is in the same figurative place as the protagonist at the beginning of the story.This is full-circle story about how a crime creates a ripple effect on all the people involved, as well as their relatives. The storytelling of this movie is really enhanced by the unconstrained cinematography. The ending of the movie is not really tragic, but it leaves you with a feeling that life goes in circles, and that not all circles are good. I highly recommend this movie.",The Place Beyond the Pines

While I was expecting Gosling's character to be fairly badass (which it was,) I was not expecting the curve ball that was thrown into the movie. As a result of this, the time scales changed, along with the focus of the plot. You really end up finishing quite a different movie than the one you thought you had started. It has an epic appeal in that sense (the running time is pretty long.) Despite this, the ending is fairly typical and wraps up the tension of the movie in a standard fashion.

305,farrokh-bulsara,An American modern tragedy,10,12 April 2013,"An American modern tragedy, built in three acts, each one marked by a protagonist and a variation on the theme of justice, with the unavoidable final resolution, cathartic and merciful, crossed in the middle by the all-round and anti-manicheist character of policeman (and then attorney) Avery Cross, mirror of a ferociously ambitious humanity, but still born in a world of values which is lost, and which lost him. In this world without fathers, in which the absorbing 140 minutes of film runs fast, as in Shakespeare's plays father's guilt falls on their sons, and the confront between transversal generations and justices leaves more than a doubt about which could be or not a perfect education: sons of nobody, of the old democratic guard (Avery's father), of adoptive substitutive fathers (Jason's black father), of dead defamed men or exalted heroes, the truth is in the middle and it loses itself. The narrative construction, treble like in a play, leaves the protagonist aside after about 40 minutes, like Hitchcock's MacGuffin in ""Psyco"", and focuses on the consequences of a simple bloody gesture which, as in life, are lethal, vital, forever: policeman Avery's coming up in the scene clears up the plot, and opens to the third film in the film, the most convincing and touching, in which choices of the past become the self-destructive, vulgar, tragic, vindictive present of two opposite boys, socially different, united by drugs, fighting for a past which doesn't belong to them but by whom they depend. In this narrative game, which proudly escapes from overblown effects of flashback (just a family picture appears as a memento and moment of life), tragedy drifts in a rhythm which doses the furor and sculpts with file psychologically surprising characters. In the clockwork orange which is nowadays American society, that real ugly dirty bad one which indie cinema knows and must tell, executed and archived violence comes back like a boomerang, death doesn't redeem, so that who executes violence and who is subjected to it are the usual ones, winners or losers in the same microcosm, genetically destined to glory or to scaffold. So it doesn't wonder that in this époque without moral or justice values, a time of ecstasy in all senses, ambition is the only reason to live, sons of great men and sons of outlaws which fight in the name of a single past act, glorious for Sunday hero (as in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"") and ignominious for Sunday delinquent: the act of violence makes and dismantles families and people, but the world is a tricked championship, and always the same win, lords of power and money. Or almost, perhaps, because the formidable author Derek Cianfrance mixes cards, asks the audience participation, sympathy and benefit of doubt, because nothing is what it seems. Emotion is assured not only by a deep script and a neurotic direction, which is masterful in the actions scenes as in most intimate ones (to remember, the title long take with Luke walking to the death wheel, the hand camera at the character's shoulders, dolly from high on the routes), but also by excellent and moving actors: gelid, serious, alienated, Ryan Gosling is surely the best actor of this decade, but the great surprise is Bradley Cooper, which, optimal if not better in dramatic register, remembers his education at Actor's Studio. This film is a gem in the art of storytelling, happily commented by a very punctual and eclectic music choice, unique in its way to describe, turn over, criticize nowadays corrupt society, with a graceful, tender, cruel, merciful, cold touch, all in one.

The man puts down the knife and exits his trailer only to be lost in a crowd of carnies, customers, the night's life. The man approaches a tent of roaring spectators waiting for a show of minimal thrill. The man puts on a helmet while sitting on a motorcycle. The man drives his motorcycle into a cage. The man's motorcycle is lost within the rising roars of an audience.This is the opening scene of ""The Place Beyond the Pines"". The scene is so wonderfully crafted and lyrical one would think they are seeing a Cormac Mccarthy novel being projected into instant images. Although this scene(as well as some other scenes) seem to promise a great sense of craft, their level of ingenuity cannot be said for the rest of the film.Make no mistake, in its structure ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is an ambitious movie and because of this ambition the movie could very easily be considered great. The movie attempts to paint a canvas of the relationship between fathers and sons within three segments while by the end trying to make them all seem coherent. While on paper the idea of building a movie in such a way may have sounded enticing the final product ends up a bit disjointed and tedious.Director Derek Cianfrance has a knack for writing engaging characters.(As also seen in ""Blue Valentine"") As to the notion of Cianfrance's characters being likable is an idea worth debating, but what can be said is he has a craft for establishing people one would want to know more about. Yet where Cianfrance seems to fall short is finding ways to keep his story constantly fluid after introducing such interesting characters.It is understandable why themes of parenthood and the repercussions of parenthood would be ideal for a film revolving around interlocking characters. In a recent interview Derek Cianfrance mentioned he looked to films such as ""The Deer Hunter"" as inspiration for ""The Place Beyond the Pines"". What ""The Deer Hunter"" has is a coherent sense of direction and where each character harbors their emotional beats while covering enormous themes within its lengthy time frame. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" on the other hand seems to freeze in its own massive structure, not knowing what to do with its simple theme for two and a half hours. Perhaps if Cianfrance chose to refine his vision for his film's repeating theme he would have had a poetic masterpiece on his hands, instead what he has is a movie that is crushed under its own weight.Also an extra star for Ryan Gosling's abs.",The Place Beyond the Pines
307,MetroMike,Wonderful and Strange,9,7 April 2013,"I liked this movie a lot (and unlike some here, didn't think it was too long). But I'm surprised no one else has pointed out what I thought was the most startling thing in the plot: Derek Cianfrance kills off his star partway through then makes the killer the new hero, exactly the way Alfred Hitchcock did in Psycho.As I realized this watching the movie last night, I wondered if I was the first person to notice it. Then I looked up the reviews in the New York Times and saw that Ryan Gosling had hinted at it himself (""Myth Making on Motorcycles"" 3/22/13):""I never felt more like Janet Leigh in my life,"" Ryan Gosling said with his best straight face.The filmmaker Derek Cianfrance, who has known Mr. Gosling for seven years and directed him in two films, chimed in, ""You have a nice figure, like she does.""Mr. Gosling replied: ""The hair. That's why I went platinum.""",The Place Beyond the Pines
308,xenoraiser,Full of Impact,8,19 April 2013,"One doesn't enter The Place Beyond the Pines with mild expectations. In-between its long and deliberate opening, to a surprisingly clean final shot lies a movie embodied by ambition and emotion. While the three-act structure is divided in a very clear-cut manner, the depictions and characters are anything but. The innocent way to pitch the film, to borrow a quote from the trailer, is that it's about ""fathers, sons and consequences."" At the forefront is Ryan Gosling as a stunt-driver, who suddenly finds that he has a son and just as quickly sees his life take several fast turns. These, in turn, become the backdrop for a majority of the movie's ongoings. Attention eventually comes to Bradley Cooper, who plays a cop in a nearly unrecognizable performance. In due time, we're given the shapings of a select few characters, as we see points in their lives shape what they've become, as well as what they will become. Derek Cianfrance didn't exactly receive soft remarks for his previous film, Blue Valentine. Likewise, The Place Beyond the Pines doesn't gear itself towards a timid audience. Climaxes usually stand somewhere in or around the third act of a story, but this one showcases its most intense and gasp-worthy parts nearly an hour in. From that point, it's tough to let your hands off the armrests or take your eyes away from the screen. Credit must be given to the script and camera work, both of which play a large part in grounding the movie. Because of that, we get caught up to the nth degree. Commentary and study come into play, especially around the second act when the immediate effects of one event ignite more than just a trickling effect. And while emotion is still gripped and clenched during the final act, some indecisive meandering comes out, which isn't helped by what turns out to be a stereotypical depiction. It also feels like we miss out on some lingering questions as (part of) the story rides off. The aforementioned consequences don't all come full swing, and the ending leaves an empty sense of conclusiveness, if that.Were it not for the problems sprouting out of the third act, The Place Beyond the Pines could've been elevated from great to truly excellent. But even without an actual sense of finality, one can't deny the occasional blood-pumping and conscience-throbbing intensity that comes with it.www.recaphub.com",The Place Beyond the Pines
309,lui-samantha,This three part saga is worth the watch,10,21 September 2012,"Ryan Gosling and Derek Cianfrance join forces once again since 2010's Blue Valentine in this multi-generational crime saga.Channeling another mysterious character like the one he played in Drive, Gosling is Luke, a motorcycle stunt driver who works at a traveling carnival touring from town to town. After reuniting with his sometimes lover Romina (Eva Mendes), he discovers that he has fathered a son. Determined to meet the responsibilities of being a father but unable to support a family, Luke decides to rob banks. A skilled motorcyclist, his ploy appears to run successfully. But on a heist gone wrong, he becomes the target of a rookie cop named Avery (Bradley Cooper). And as a result, the confrontation determines his fate.Without wanting to reveal too much, Gosling's perfectly reckless and unsympathetic character only appears in the first part of the film. But handing off the rest of the story to Cooper, the film is not any less captivating. As guilt continues to build up from the events of his past, Cooper delivers one of his best performances to date as a cop split between his ambitions and the need to serve justice.Even the supporting characters such as Ben Medelsohn's good-natured accomplice and Ray Liotta's dirty cop offer admirable performances. However, the real star in the making is Dane DeHaan, who brilliantly plays Jason, the vengeful teenage son of Gosling's character.Split into three parts, The Place Beyond the Pines is a crime thriller about legacy. As the story goes from generation to generation, it takes surprising turns even though it feels slow at times.But despite its lengthy two hours and 20 minutes, the film is good for character study. Taking an interesting look at themes such as guilt, revenge and justice, the performances coupled with Cianfrance's unique approach to directing is worth a watch.",The Place Beyond the Pines
310,waqarr40,"It's powerful, it's bold, it hits you hard",8,22 April 2013,"In The Place Beyond the Pines - a roaring drama that combines the gritty intimacy of a B-movie noir and the outsized ambition of a multi generational Hollywood saga - Ryan Gosling's motorcycle stunt rider is covered in tattoos: an owl, a Bible, a boxer, a spiderweb, a hand grenade, a dagger dripping blood.That last one is on Luke's face. With his shock of peroxide blond hair and his souped-up motocross machine, the guy doesn't exactly blend into the scenery. But when the carnival Luke travels with pitches its tents - and its ""Globe of Death"" motorbike show - for its annual stint in Schenectady, N.Y., blending into the scenery becomes his new mission. He discovers he's the father of a baby boy, sired a year earlier when he was in town and struck up a relationship with a waitress, Romina (a riveting Eva Mendes).""Who's that guy?"" he asks, gesturing to the infant in her arms ""He's yours."" And so, the whole axis of Luke's world starts spinning in unfamiliar ways. But in director Derek Cianfrance's daringly constructed and compelling film, taking on the responsibilities of fatherhood is something Luke's not sure how to do. To be a provider, he reckons, means having money. And having money means robbing banks.n no time at all, he's partnered with a mechanic (the ace Aussie Ben Mendelsohn) experienced in the art of armed robbery. Next thing you know, there's a guy in a ski mask waving weaponry at scared-silly tellers, screaming at them to fill up his backpack. His getaway bike is right by the door.Gosling, paired opposite Michelle Williams in Cianfrance's moody Blue Valentine, is electric here, and the bank heist scenes are crazy-nervous and thrilling. Especially the one when a Schenectady cop, Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper), takes after him, a high-speed chase that zooms along streets, down alleyways, across a cemetery The bank robber and the cop end up in a house together, at which point The Place Beyond the Pines turns into Avery's story, with Cooper demonstrating (if Silver Linings Playbook left any doubt) that he's a serious actor - a seriously talented, instinctive, risk-taking actor.Smart, ambitious, with much to prove to himself and his family, Avery wrestles with the consequences of his fateful encounter with Luke. The character's evolution is fascinating. (Harris Yulin, as Avery's father, a judge, is terrific, and Ray Liotta, as one of Avery's brethren on the force, is, well . . . when you've got Liotta in your picture, you know there's going to be some really nasty business.) The Place Beyond the Pines is a triptych - the Luke chapter, the Avery chapter, and a final section that transpires 15 years later. Two young actors, Emory Cohen and Dane DeHaan, are the leads here. I confess that at first I wished Cianfrance had just let things end with Avery. But as this last act unfolds, and the dynamic between the two kids - they're in high school together - develops, everything falls into place.

311,edroberts417,The Place Beyond the Pines,8,4 November 2013,"There is a place in the arts for audacity and The Place Beyond the Pines, the second major release of director Derek Cianfrance, fills that place admirably. The film is broken into three different stories, each with it's own full, three-act narrative—a triptych, really. Experimenting with conventional story lines is a hard thing to pull off without smacking of self-unconsciousness and film school and and when fails it comes off as, well, a ridiculous self-indulgence. Therein lies the audacity, and the pitfalls, of cinematic triptychs. Forced by the linear nature of cinema to present the three segments over a span of time, the first and, to a lesser degree, the second segments fade into the past as the third segment progresses. By intention or by good fortune, ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" meets the challenge by making the first segment the most engaging and elemental and the other two acts subsequently less so, achieving a balance of sorts.The first is the story of Luke (Ryan Gosling), an itinerant motorcycle daredevil in Schenectady for a couple of days with a traveling carnival that, apparently, comes through town every year. Gosling's range isn't wide—his characters all tend to be similar—but he does what he does he does very well and this is perhaps his best characterization of the enigmatic sadness and lost humanity that seem to imbue all his roles. Our first introduction to Luke is through a very long and uncut tracking shot as he suits up and walks from his tent to the main tent where he will ride a motorcycle around and up and down inside a globe- shaped steel mesh cage. In the shot, Luke is walking away from us. It's what he does. Luke walks away. He, presumably, walks away from every town the carnival visits and the women he meets there and, in the larger picture, is walking away from a troubled past evidenced by a brief reference to a fatherless childhood and by the haphazard smattering of homemade prison tattoos adorning his torso, neck and face. He looks like the kind of person who might have cigarette burns on his arms—if you take my meaning. But this time the visit to Schenectady takes a different turn when Luke is approached by a past fling partner, Romina (Eva Mendez), and learns that he fathered a child when last in town. Straightaway, Luke quits the carnival, makes a bid for forming a family, even though Romina is in a live-in relationship and, when that doesn't work, turns to robbing banks in order to do his part to support his son. Somehow, in the twisted narrative of Luke's life, this makes some sense to him. In spite of his larcenous nature, Luke's motivation is admirable—he wants to be a good father, even if he doesn't know how. He's earnestly doing the best he can with what he has and when it all goes sideways, and his inevitable end unfolds, we can't help but sympathize and hope against hope that things will can turn out okay for him—a sentiment just as naive as Luke's notion that robbing banks is a viable way to support his family.Luke's story segues elegantly into the second segment, having to do with a rookie cop named Avery, played by Bradley Cooper in one of his more impressive efforts, who becomes tangentially involved with Luke and his little fractured semblance of a family. Avery, a morally conflicted man and would be politician (Imagine that, a morally conflicted politician. Too much, I say.), taints himself with a spur of the moment untruth and subsequent participation, albeit reluctantly, in a bit of police corruption engineered by no other than that most perfect of sinister dirty cops—Ray Liotta, who at this point in his career has perfected the role to the point of transcendence. Avery, calculating political animal that he is, does show humanity and compassion and agonizes over the future of Luke's son, but still, it's hard to like him—especially when we see how he treats his own son.Which brings us to the third of the three stories, curiously the weakest, yet most essential of the three in that it deals most directly with the central theme—fathers and sons. The transition into the final segment, is a bit contrived, as is the rest of it, but does do a workmanlike job of tying the first two together and the contrivance can be overlooked as a necessary device to bring the narrative together thematically. To go into it too deeply here would be to give away perhaps the most essential relationship of the story. In spite of the awkwardness toward the end, and its 220 minute running time, ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is engaging throughout, mostly due to the extremely well established narrative arc and character development of the first segment and, to a lesser degree, the second. But the best thing about the film is that it breaks the mold of the conventional, and safe, dramatic narratives out there and hails a courageous and talented new filmmaker willing to move beyond the conventional, and safe, single arc narratives that have dominated feature films for, well, forever.",The Place Beyond the Pines

314,BrentAMG,Moving Three-Part Saga,9,23 January 2014,"Talk about an all-star cast. Ry-Ry (Ryan Gosling), Bradley Cooper, Eva Mendes, and Ray Liotta. I remember watching the trailer thinking that The Place Beyond the Pines would easily be one of the best pictures of 2013. I want you to watch it, intently, and enjoy the experience. I'll provide a brief summary and offer some insights and comment on some of the strengths and weaknesses of the film.The Place Beyond the Pines is a three-part saga. Each of the three distinct stories are connected and reverberate similar themes such as fatherhood, justice, revenge, and the frailty of humankind. The first of these stories involves Ryan Gosling's character, Luke, who is a talented motorcyclist. Discovering he fathered a son with Romina (Mendes) last year when in Schnectedy, NY, Luke decides to quit his traveling stunt-act and provide for his child. Because of his unique set of skills (Taken reference, boom), he cannot find steady work that enables him to edge out his competition: Romina's new lover. The natural response for Luke is to begin robbing banks. In short, this life choice puts him on a path to crossing rookie-officer Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper). From their initial meeting, their lives were intertwined.The second story focuses on the rise of hero-cop Avery Cross. The son of a New York Supreme Court judge, Cross disappointed his father when he became a police officer, despite his having a law degree and passing the bar. However, when cataclysmic events create an opportunity for the quick and resourceful officer, he finds a way to rapidly ascend the latter of success. Most of the this occurred, of course, at the expense of his family.The third story (or act, as one may call it) primarily focuses on the new friendship of Avery Cross Jr. – aka AJ (Emory Cohen) – and the son of Luke Glanton, Jason (Dane DeHaan). A son of divorced parents, AJ leads a life absent of a strong father figure and, as a result, falls into alcohol, illegal drugs, and smugness. When he moves to Schnectedy to live with his father for his senior year, he meets Jason. The two misfits form a bond. Unknowingly, AJ's and Jason's lives are far more intertwined than they could have imagined. When these demons begin to reveal themselves, lives change. I hope that tease was enough to entice you to watch the movie; there were many strengths.Strengths: Obviously, the most prominent plus of the film was the acting prowess. Each actor has previously proved themselves to be in the upper-echelon of Hollywood; particularly Gosling. As he has displayed in other films, Gosling is magnetic on screen (beyond his striking good looks). He is able to convey a lot of different emotions and thoughts without uttering a word; a talent that Bryan Cranston has epitomized in his role as Walter White on AMC's Breaking Bad. The directing and cinematography were sensational. Additionally, the music was top-notch. The score bolstered the emotions of each scene, while careful to never overpower the actors.Weaknesses: The third act. The first two acts were masterpieces of story-telling. The themes were relevant and the execution was flawless. However, something seemed to be lacking in the third section. It is difficult to pinpoint what was problematic but I believe it could be something to do with the fact that it was driven by young actors and, while they are certainly not terrible, they do not possess the same experience as the veterans that dominated the first two sections. The juxtaposition of different experience levels of actors hurt the film, I believe, because it exposed the detriment of the young actors. Furthermore — and this is completely subjective — one of the lines by Luke's friend, Robin, really bothered me. If you ride like lightning, you're gonna crash like thunder. I expected more. I thought it was cheesy. Maybe the line itself was okay but the delivery was all wrong. I don't know. I do know, however, that I didn't like it.While I would rank Beyond the Pines in the top films of 2013 thus far, it did have some disappointing aspects; it was not the flawless film that I preemptively decided it would be. I believe that film lovers and story-tellers should see this movie. If you liked Blue Valentine, you will like this movie (same director, Derek Cianfrance). This is definitely a movie I will someday buy for my collection. 4.4/ 5",The Place Beyond the Pines

With stunning performances in Drive, Blue Valentine, Half Nelson, The Ides of March, The Notebook and Lars and the Real Girl, Gosling has built a firm reputation as an actor who skips out on the big paycheck to make Hollywood crap for a chance to work in solid movies. And if there are still any naive doubters of the greatness that is the Gosling, he easily wipes away any second-guessing with his latest GREAT movieThe Place Beyond the Pines.Writer/Director Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine) delivers a gorgeous monster of a film, interweaving a unique story filled with the kind of juicy highly flawed characters that ooze layers upon layers of relatable believability. The is the kind of screenplay filled with people so real that it hurts that should be read by every film student studying screen writing. Cianfrance along with co-writers Ben Coccio and Darius Marder ignore doing what is expected, and rise above the easy route of churning out another formulaic nightmare.Beyond Gosling, the film's acting is nothing short of superb. Bradley Cooper (Silver Lining's Playbook, The Hangover) proves yet again that he can hang with the best, and Rose Byrne (Bridesmaids, X-Men: First Class) and Eva Mendez (Hitch, Training Day) work wonders in their supporting roles.The Place Beyond the Pines is the kind of character driven film that tends to get lost in the shuffle during Hollywood's blockbuster season.

317,popandcrackcorn,A Place Beyond the Pines is classic cinema,9,26 August 2013,"Derek Cianfrance's The Place Beyond the Pines is one of those rare movies that deserve every Academy Award available, but will end up getting Best Interracial Relationship on Film or some vague award that's solely included in the Academy Awards Gone Wild DVD release. And that's a shame, as the film handles heavy relationships between random people that hasn't been approached with such effectiveness since 2004's Traffic. Another bonus point is that The Place Beyond the Pines redeems Ryan Gosling for the atrocious Only God Forgives (see my review below). While both tried to show how any person can become the monster inside when triggered by life's struggle, the latter uses an overload of existential imagery and dream like sequences. The Place Beyond the Pines keeps the story simple and never loses focus on the characters that we are engaged to, despite a multitude of plot lines and character introductions. But it pulls it off, and is without a doubt the best film of the year, which says a lot when it's competing with a movie about robots fighting big ass monsters.The Place Beyond the Pines follows the story of Luke, a stunt motorcyclist who moves town to town with a carnival as the third biker in of the wheel of death. The carnival comes back to a city where Luke finds he has a child with Romina (the sexy Eva Mendes who will one day finally respond to my burned writings on her lawn). As any sane man would do, he decides to stay with the hot ass Mendes though more for the love of his son, despite her living with another man who has been the boys ""father"" through his missing years (the very talented Mahershala Ali). To prove that he can take care of his estranged family, Luke turns to nefarious deeds lead by his now mechanic boss Robin, played exceptionally by Ben Mendelsohn.I can't say much about what happens next without spoilers, but the focus of the film soon switches to Police Officer Avery (Bradley Cooper), who becomes unexpectedly involved with Luke's life. I've never considered Cooper to be that strong of an actor, apart from maybe Silver Linings, but his work in The Place Beyond the Pines proves his ability to be one of our generation's top actors. Officer Avery gains notoriety for a spoiler reason, and is approached by a shady branch of the Cops lead by Deluca (Ray Liotta at his crazy finest). More spoilers happen, and the film travels to Luke and Avery's sons who mirror their father's lives in spoiler ways.It sounds confusing, but director Cianfrance pulls it off without a moment of lag time or needless plot filler. Every character has a believable and interesting back story, while the plot itself manages to remain compelling and captivating. I generally hate films that cover multi-generations or have multi plot lines, apart from The Godfather and Pulp Fiction, but The Place Beyond the Pines somehow handles both brilliantly.I recommend The Place Beyond the Pines to anyone who enjoys good movies. With an unconventional style that hasn't been seen since Hitchcock's Psycho, the quality of the film remains due to a focused story with interesting characters. Cianfrance keeps it simple, and trusts that his audience will identify with the main characters due to a superb script. Even if you don't agree with the choices that they make, you still remain captivated by their struggles and hope they pull through. I hesitated for weeks to see The Place Beyond the Pines, and now regret that. Watch it now, and enjoy.",The Place Beyond the Pines
318,steadrick1,Great first act..,5,8 July 2014,"The first act was visceral, grabbed you by the throat in the opening sequence and wouldn't let go. As first acts go 10/10. Then Gosling dies. Not in any special way either. He jumps out of a window. Then bradley cooper's rookie cop turns up and everything becomes a mess. I tried to make sense of what the director was trying to achieve, maybe he was making some kind of elusive elliptical point. He should have just stuck with expanding on a brilliant first act. Real shame. But it is worth watching for Gosling alone.",The Place Beyond the Pines
319,DJB126,Would've Been A 9/10 Had It Not Been For The Last Act.,7,17 August 2020,"The first act was very good. Reminded me a lot of the film ""Drive"", also starring Ryan Gosling.The second act was also good, not as good, but still good nonetheless, although it had almost nothing to do with the first act, I suppose the writer/director was kinda going for three different stories that happened to correlate with one another.And then we have act three. Not good at all. This movie really made me realize how stinky of an actor that kid from Chronicle is. I suppose it's not so much that he's a bad actor, and more so that he has no range. He plays the EXACT same character in everything I've seen him in. Shy, awkward kid that gets fed up with something/someone, seeks revenge. Mega stinky doo doo garbo.If the film had kept up with the energy of the first act, definitely, without a doubt, would've been a 9/10. 9.5/10 if IMDb would let us use decimals in our ratings.

320,prairiebird,More Drama than Action,8,26 February 2019,"This movie was gripping to me. It is not just about riding around on a motorcycle or robbing banks. There are some fights between two of the main character that cut deep, and a twist I did not see coming that I was glad had not been spoiled for me. Not action packed, so he warned that it does ""slow down"" in some places, but I think anyone can appreciate this story about struggle.",The Place Beyond the Pines

The twists, turns, the intertwining stories, the simple moments... it's truly a heart warming and devastating depiction of what life can be depending on the decisions you make. In my personal opinion it's almost a perfect movie. I remember seeing it in theaters and I was so exhausted by the end, in the best way. I told everyone I could about it and encouraged them to watch it. It made me feel like I was apart of these characters lives, which is exactly what a movie should do. It makes me sad that I don't feel it got the attention it deserved.

It was a great film and was very entertaining. I'd recommend you take a chance and go see this film. Expect some theatrical diversity and in the end it all comes back full circle.I have nothing negative to say. The acting was mature and accurate. Each character was playing a role that suited their own set of talents superbly.Try not to read too many reviews and just go and see this movie. You will not be disappointed.",The Place Beyond the Pines
323,BHof890474,Very contrived plot - -,3,6 September 2013,"The best thing I can say about this is that the actors are really able to ""flesh out"" their roles. I can't fault any of them. What really kills it is the contrived plot; every plot twist seems like a square peg that has been whittled to fit into a round hole. For examples, I offer:1. The same cop who is the media darling ""just happens"" to turn into the department Serpico 10 minutes later.2. The Chief of Police who wants to sweep the whole corruption thing under the rug is still on the job 15 years later and, get this, he's working hand in glove with the same guy he told to get lost!3. The two sons ""just happen"" to be attending the same high school 15 years later and are able not only to connect, but to immediately develop a drug connection.4. After being busted for a drug deal and out on bail, Jason is immediately able to be talked into stealing more for the same kid who, again, he barely knows. 5. So wiped out on booze and oxicontin that he can barely navigate the stairs, Jason ""just happens"" to see Avery Cross' picture on the wall of the stairway, put it all together and then confront his son in a violent argument.There are more of these, but you get the idea. Overall, a two hour exercise in fatuous.",The Place Beyond the Pines
324,prabashsanka,Epic and Emotional,10,25 August 2021,Loved every minute of this beautiful piece of art. Don't fall for the negatives. I won't feel emotional in even sad movies most of the time. But i loved this one and it made me kinda sad and happy..this will remain as a favourite of mine.,The Place Beyond the Pines
325,avagaysmith,Brilliant story telling,10,17 July 2014,"When I first heard of this movie I thought ""how good could this possibly be?"" I never thought it would be of worth to be honest. Then I decided to check out Ryan Gosling's IMDb profile after seeing a report that he was in a relationship with Eva Mendes. I read the little summary that usually accompanies the movies and I said 'ok...let me give it a try and see what it's about.' So I did. I gave ""The place beyond the pines"" a try. From the very beginning it was captivating. A shot of a man's back as he walks through a crowded park with a t-shirt that appeared to be on the wrong side. I wondered ""where is this movie really going?"" Even at the very last minute of the movie I really still didn't know. It was a brilliant piece of story telling following the lives of men and their families and how there seeks to be a balance in the whole equation of life. One person does wrong and it affects another (and a whole host of others) and it continues to do so for a lifetime affecting multiple generations. This movie tells about family, love (if you could call it that), power, corruption, justice, honesty. In the end it really tells the story about how good conquers evil...as cliché as that is. I was left feeling absolutely moved by this movie. There were no tears but my spirit is heavy. It has left me reflective. If you're in the mood for drama that brings about reflection, watch this brilliant display of story telling. Watch Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper lead this cinematic work of art with the simplest of words and expressions.",The Place Beyond the Pines
326,gogerix,"Crime Doesn't Pay, Does Honesty?",9,7 April 2015,"The Place Beyond the Pines (2012) Basic info: this movie is a crime drama concerning a bank robber played by Ryan Gosling, a cop played by Bradley Cooper, and their sons (played by Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen respectively). Those are the lead actors, but plenty of essential side characters, side stories and nuances marvelously build up the main story. The director and writer of this movie is Derek Cianfrance (note: there are other people also credited for the story and screenplay, namely Ben Coccio and Darius Marder).To start, the writing is beautiful. The movie takes its time developing the story, which means that it runs for 140 minutes. Do not be averted by that fact since you may miss a real gem of a film. The story consists of three interwoven parts and it speaks of life. Moreover, it does so not in an ""I want to poke my eyes out"" dull way, but rather as an attention grabbing, ""wondering what is next"" thrilling variety. The best way to describe the story is to say that it is real. There are no clichés, no Hollywood stereotypes, or at least they eluded my watchful eyes. Maybe bedazzling by the movie caused it. Therefore, the story is grand, but what of the characters? They may be even superior. They spring at the viewer full of life, they avow you, not on an emotional level (at least not to me), but rather on that basic level where you wonder how do they craft it so real? Are they even acting? To put it simply, Ryan Gosling is startling, Bradley Cooper is unbelievable and Eva Mendes is astonishing. Dane DeHaan is not far-off behind them. Kanye West rapped it best with his song Amazing.There aren't exactly any vital downsides to the movie. It might be slow (read dull) at times and at certain moments, but the story necessitates that. Mike Patton (of Faith No More fame) did the score on this one and it is much in the vein of something Mike Patton would do a weird fit. Certainly takes some time getting used to. Even afterward, the music does not sit perfectly. One film in particular springs to mind upon hearing the score, and that is Drive. However, while in that movie the score sets up atmosphere perfectly, here it is kind of deficient. It is sinister and twisted, somewhat horror like, and at all times you are just waiting for a monster to soar out and kill something. I presume the point was to make you realize that the tale you are watching is a dark, grim tale, you could not possibly get pleasure from, yet somehow you do. That is the most truthful telltale sign of a splendid movie. This one is for remembrance.FINAL MARK: 9 / 10Visit HatedCritic for more reviews...",The Place Beyond the Pines
327,sb703,Real poignant depth,9,28 February 2021,"There's a depth to this movie that you don't see often. It's not about bank robbers or love triangles or ambition. It's about mistakes and their effects on the people who come after us. There are some seriously flawed but very real characters in this and that was what was so engaging.Not wanting to spoil this, the movie is set is 3 distinct parts, each quite engaging but I would have liked more from the last part, because that really was when everything came together.",The Place Beyond the Pines
328,jackosmithy,"Beautiful story, beautifully told",7,9 October 2017,"I was interested by this movie as it is directed by the man who brought us Blue Valentine, which was fantastic. This movie shocked me in every way, and I could tell just from very first shot that it will surprise me.It was not only the amazing work in the visuals and casting, but it was the story and the way it was told that shocked me. Some decisions that were made in the writing and progression of the story were fantastic in the way they deviated from general storytelling ways, while holding a three act structure.Another way this movie amazed me is the combination of many genres, which was effective and never felt overwhelming or confusing. The theme of decision-making and doing the right thing is the obvious dominant theme and the portrayal of that is effective.There is one actor in this movie which stole the show, and that is the performance of Bradley Cooper, who took this character and made it his. At no point did I retract from the story to think to myself, ""wow, Bradley Cooper is really good in this"", but after the film after thinking about it was when I really appreciated the way he portrayed this character, and his character serves as the central point for the dominant theme of the movie, which was also done very well.The only negative I can really think for this movie is the ambiguity and openness of certain parts of the story which some people may not like and could perhaps prefer that closure.To conclude, this is definitely a film worth your money if you are a fan of storytelling, emotion and great film-making.",The Place Beyond the Pines

There are some really irritating things that cost it ! !/2 to 2 stars such as having his Mexican mother of his son living with a Negro - c'mon, inserting a black into every film is not necessary or desirable. As with all action flicks some of the driving, shooting, etc. Is not realistic but is acceptable to make the story work. DeHaan was very good as Gosling's grown son. Mendez is blah.

331,Mr-bravestone,Excellent Story about the Importance of Family and Choices,9,25 June 2013,"Seems to me a lot of people expected something different. But if you pay attention to the plot you're getting a real treat in storytelling. Saying this, the first act is absolutely dynamite and I was drawn in the moment Gosling took to his motorcycle.But this film is not just about motorcycle and living the life of crime. Like everyone, we want something more. In this case for Luke, it's a family. For most characters in the film, it's yearning for something a little bit more at the core of what they already have. Again, like everybody usually does.The characters were hard wired to have flaws. Everyone seems a little trashy. The message of the film is about what lack of parenting could do to their offspring and even though some characters seemed too good to be true, they weren't without flaws especially on how it affects the others around them.Haunting cinematography and score really set the tone for that particular moment in time, especially conveying what the character was feeling at that particular time. Great job all around.If you're one of those who were disappointed with the first take-in, give it another chance. The 2 kid character actors are great, and the ending scene alone is enough to give it another look.",The Place Beyond the Pines

333,smallandmighty-294-659109,"Full of depth. A real, immersive experience",9,17 August 2013,"Following up the masterpiece that was Blue Valentine is surely one of the toughest tasks a filmmaker has been faced with. Luckily, Derek Cianfrance creates a great, if inferior, film that feels more than just a movie, but an insight into real lives of real people.The Place Beyond The Pines, like Blue Valentine, deals with multiple stories, each with its own set of amazing moments. One story feels like a romantic drama dressed as a crime drama (think The Town, or Drive), another is a domestic/familial drama disguised as a cop thriller, while the other is a tale of discovery and revenge wrapped in a coming-of-age tale. The first two stories were genuinely knock-out, and engaging throughout, but the final story is a little lacking, and perhaps too long. I would have happily watched more of the other two stories. This means the plot loses some of its drive toward the end of its lengthy running time (135 mins). This is where the film may lose the interest of some; in presenting these separate stories, it may feel to some that it diverges and tangents. However, thematically, the movie remains quite focused, with certain themes (who you are vs. who you want to be, living with the consequences of your actions, among others)constantly at the forefront. The more you look, the more you'll see and, crucially, feel.Every scene of The Pines is drenched in so much emotion, be it sadness, sympathy, anger, love or hope, that it is bound to connect with anyone at least once. The key to this emotional depth is the combination of the writing of its characters and the actors portraying them. Much like Blue Valentine, the interactions between characters feel so real,with the actors talking over each other, laughing mid-sentence or taking very long pauses in such a realistic manner that you'll forget you're watching a bunch of A-listers on screen. Each of the main characters is played in such a relatable and sympathetic manner, and in ways that are not black-and-white, but just as complex as real people. And just as there are scenes that will connect with anyone, there will be at least one character that a viewer's heart will latch onto. For me, the real heart came from Eva Mendes' character Romina.While all the actors in major roles gives flawless performances, there are far too many to talk about everyone. However, as I said, Mendes made me the most emotional, and for me, she stole the show (very surprising, as i haven't been a fan in the past).The visual and atmospheric style is quite unusual, at times feeling bold, grand and cinematic: a crane shot of Gosling riding a bike surrounded by towering, otherworldly trees; an intense, high speed pursuit. And at other times humble and almost documentary-like: intimate conversations shot in one take; long tracking shots from behind of people walking. There is also one particular musical piece (The Snow Angel by Mike Patton) played twice in the film that is simply beautiful.Overall, while the narrative may lose some steam toward the end, the real feel of The Place Beyond The Pines comes from its rich characters and raw emotion throughout. I have now seen it 3 times, and each time it finished, I immediately wanted to watch it all over again. Hopefully, so will you.",The Place Beyond the Pines
334,venkykp10,It's the name that intrigues you the most...!,7,22 May 2013,"As for the movie,it is the plot that feeds off the actors..Its been an awesome last year for Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper and it looks like this year is going to be no different..A packed storyline embellished on its course by the rising above-mentioned star duo and Eva Mendes sure seems enough to keep you on tenterhooks throughout the flick but somewhere along the ride things become distraught kept intact only by the solidness of Cooper and Mendes;one of whom might even be worthy of an Oscar for spectacular acting display..Eva Mendes is hot even when she is sad..She has given some real heart to the performance..While the same can't be said of the Hangover star,there is no way he doesn't play his conflicting cop/DA character to near-perfection.. Now moving on to Ryan Gosling...Man,he is nuts..maybe that's how he is in real life..A carefree,lover turned caring father @ bank robber..he plays his role to absolute perfection..Almost reminds you of his role in ""Blue Valentine"",only better..This guy is so versatile you would think he could have donned Bradley Cooper's role even better than the latter..Now whether the same can be said for Bradley Cooper?;I am not sure..Which is exactly why it's a shame that Ryan Gosling won't be Oscar nominated because his role albeit short-lived is only a lead-point to this wonderfully written movie.. The only critique I have is that the film could have been shorter and although the two teens in the later part of the film have grooved well into their roles of drug-addicts(the address of the issue in such a flick is pretty smart i think),you can't help but feel this three part saga about ambitions and karma is a bit disjointed at turns and can bite you in the ass...

335,mmainero,Too Long or Not Long Enough,5,24 August 2013,"It could have been better; good acting might have carried it, but the absolutely clichéd soundtrack started grating on me early. And the most surprising thing about the ending is that anyone would think it was believable. After all the dawdling over the beginning of the movie, it was quite a shock to see the dreaded ""15 years later"" show up, like something a high-schooler would have written. In fact, I think the clichés and choppy storytelling show a lot of immaturity in the writing. It's not a bad story, and like I said, the actors did what they could, but so much of the character motivation was vague, and for a movie that lasted so long, it felt like a lot was missing.

I watched it and was disappointed with the tediousness of the length and the differing story lines. This film should have been presented as three short films tied together, however flimsy. The story lines that should have been rife with tension and consequences are not. Just when you think something will go the distance and really explode...it backs up or takes a detour and it's way too neat, especially the end, THAT would be highly consequential in real life but in this movie it's another weak soft spot.

For the plot, well it was very inventive to change the main character three times, It's something that we don't see a lot and they made it look great, the transection from one to the other was quite brutal which i liked because it made yo discover the new character all at once and it didn't try to give you an impression and then change it. On the directing part. I think a great job was done, firstly I really noticed the colours as the characters changed the colours changed to match the mood. Also the director made the movie dark enough as the plot implied, but also he gave out little breaks of happiness which made the movie easy o watch On the negative part, it was a very long movie which made it a bit tiring and difficult to watch, I think that they could have made some cuts without really changing the movie.",The Place Beyond the Pines

But from the very start I questioned why can't a biker stuntman and his girlfriend working in a restaurant can raise a child. Why she has to live with some one else, especially when she is so much love with Ryan. Ryan wants his family and money; he starts bank robbery and never stops until he is shot by a police man in the middle of the film. And after that it seems I am watching a all together a different movie. Movie seems broken from there. The police man, Bradley Cooper, who by accident shot Ryan, who by heart is very good man, and is now a hero since no one knows that he shot first. He comes to know of some tricks of corrupted police officers and plays games and gets them arrested, and suddenly a notice comes on screen - ""15 years later"". Bradley Cooper is now big shot in police. His son is rich bastard. And here comes the sympathetic, helpless son of Ryan who is skinny, drug addict, poor, and riding bicycle.

345,philippsiam,Emotionally charged beauty of a film,10,9 May 2013,"Easily the best film of the year, The Place Beyond The Pines hits every note spot on. From beautiful cinematography and music, to eye wetting performances, the unfolding story really hits home and delivers a knock out punch. Satisfying in a way that most recent Hollywood films can only dream of, TPBTP will burrow into your mind and leave you thinking about it for weeks, haunting your thoughts and leaving you craving more. A real filmmakers film. A drama in three acts, what stays with you is fatherhood, legacy, family. The acting is real, yet dramatic - a perfect balance between the extremes of boring realism and melodramatic farce. Emotion is shown and felt, completely believably, so that it leaves you shaking in your seat in sympathetic resonance. There is a bit of predictability here, but this is not a thriller mystery. The payoff is in the emotional content. Arvo Pärt's Fratres is featured throughout and the stunning displays of Schenectady provide the perfect accompaniment to the family dramas which unfolds. Only one caveat: the lazy minded and attention-span challenged should probably avoid as you have to pay attention for two and a half hours - a tall order these days. This is not one big motorcycle chase movie (thank God!).",The Place Beyond the Pines
346,apstewart17,"Interesting and very effective film, although not perfect.",8,30 April 2013,"Very rarely do you have a filmmaker like Derek Cianfrance. His unconventional story telling found in his latest feature 'Place Beyond the Pines' is very similar within the structure of his previous indie hit 'Blue Valentine.' Ryan Gosling who plays an outlaw biker who robs banks is extremely effective in his performance in this film mainly due to the way Cianfrance moves the camera so masterfully. Though each performance was top notch (most notably Gosling, DeHaan, and Ben Mendelsohn) I do have a few things I need to share about the film that do cause a few kinks in its overall armour.First of all. The film does tend to throw you into things quit abruptly. Now and then you feel like you know whats going on and then all of a sudden you are dealing with a lot of things at once. This plays in part to the script and the general time line of events. I will not post any spoilers but when you see the film, you will see what I mean. Secondly, the protagonists and antagonists do tend to jump around frequently. Even when the the two son's become a huge factor in the third and final act. So sometimes it feels hard who to root for. Mainly Bradley Cooper's son AJ. When you first meet him, you hate him and you continue to hate him. Whereas with Goslings son, you can feel for him because you can guess the kind of upbringing he has had in the past 16 years.Nonetheless the film is very good. A friend of mine says that had Cianfrance created this film later into his career it has the potential to be his masterpiece, but that reality will have to be in the form of another film and for all you know in 10 years he will have that masterpiece. Pines is not perfect. But there are some moments that really get you, and the way he moves the camera is beyond amazing. I do recommend this film to someone who pays close attention to relationship and subtext rather than what is at face value.",The Place Beyond the Pines
347,maggeboiii,"2013's greatest surprise, stellar film",9,7 July 2013,"Cianfrance made a name for himself as an original filmmaker after 2010's ""Blue Valentine"". Now he's back with ""The Place Beyond The Pines"" with Gosling returning as the protagonist, with the addition of big names such as Bradley Cooper, Eva Mendes and Ray Liotta. The story is split into three segments, all intervening in some way and are consequences of the first and second parts. In the first part, we meet Gosling as an inked up, stunt-motorcyclist doing shows with a touring circus. After a spectacular show, he meets an old flame, which is the bearer of bad news. I don't wanna spoil anything at all, but Gosling makes some bad choices which ends up in a calamity with Bradley Cooper, which is a rookie cop and the main man in the second segment. Himself makes some bad choices which all comes back to him in the end. It's a thrilling and interesting exploration of blood- bonds and consequences. Gosling puts on a performance which reminds me much of ""driver"" from ""Drive"". A quiet type which is an expert on vehicles, but his character here is much more personal and shows more emotion, great play indeed. Cooper puts on one of his greatest performances to date. The rest of the supporting cast also does an amazing job, especially the younger cast.The filming is unique. The opening shot is masterful, which tells a lot about Gosling's character without him saying a single line or showing his face, that's really interesting. Some shots are just beautiful, if there's one in particular, it's when Gosling drives his motorcycle down a road through the forest, wonderful. The score is also unique, never thought a few taps on a piano could stir up so many emotions, because this film really makes you feel something.Cianfrance has probably made the greatest film of 2013 so far. The story, cast, filming and score is amazing. Unfortunately it loses some steam by the end. Nevertheless, this film is great, go see it!-MB",The Place Beyond the Pines
348,whillx,Started great and dropped like a Rock,3,29 May 2018,"This moviie started welll, but had too many things going on. Eventually the dumb Karma lost me. The second half of this movie is not interesting.",The Place Beyond the Pines
349,magovelit,"Motorcycles, Legacies, and Corruption...",7,8 September 2013,"The simple idea that our choices always have consequences is very present and unfolds in this unusual drama about three intersecting lives in Cianfrance's film, The Place Beyond the Pines. Ryan Gosling is captivating and authentic as Luke, the carnival stunt bike rider who turns bank robber in order to win over and support his lover, Romina (played by a convincing Eva Mendes)and baby boy, Jason. Bradley Cooper is a close second, turning cop Avery Cross from a naive law student into a gradual law enforcement badass as the film progresses. The film on a whole is slow burning but intriguing as we learn more about these clearly imperfect characters and their struggles to survive. The line, ""You ride like lightening, and your going to crash like thunder"", delivered by Luke's friend and bank robbing partner, Robin, sums up the motivations of both Luke and Avery perfectly. They do not stop, throughout the majority of the film, to think about what they are doing. They just do. Which, ultimately, leads to one of their downfalls. Cianfrance does a spectacular job of moulding out an unsatisfying and, at times, frustrating narrative that reflects on how once choice not only changes one life but many. And the aftermath is just as obscure and unsolved as the consequences of Luke and Avery's actions themselves--this film, if anything, proves that life does go on. And its not always pretty or happy. This film is not for everyone--it has few action scenes and isn't a happy nor final ending--but if you are willing to give subtle but powerful performances and a unruly but human storyline a chance, this is the film to see.",The Place Beyond the Pines
350,levelllll5,Good but maybe too ambitious,7,2 May 2013,"Ever since Drive, Ryan Gosling has become an object of fantasy. He is the perfect man, both good and bad, fragile and manly. The Place Beyond The Pines plays with this image, and reuses it from the very first scene. The movie opens on a close-up shot of Ryan's tattooed torso. The camera follows him, bare back, walking through a fun fair, in a scene that is a reversed strip-tease. The naked unknown guy puts on the attributes of his sexiness (a Metallica t-shirt and a red leather jacket). Exactly like in Drive, the style creates the character. The men are calling him, the girls are screaming his name. He throws his cigarette on the ground and straddles his bike. Of course he is a stuntman, and of course, even though he is not alone inside the stunt globe, he is Handsome Luke, the only one people want to see. During the first part of the movie, the real subject, and object, of the film is definitely Gosling's body, iconized just like James Dean's. After he discovers that he has a son from a fling, Luke decides to give up his way of life to take care of the child and the girl (Eva Mendes). But Romina already lives with Kofi ( Mahershala Ali) in his own house, and Kofi already takes care of her, whereas Luke doesn't have any money. Robin (Ben Mendelsohn) for whom Luke works as a mechanic, then talks him into robbing banks. Things are going well, until what the Ancient Greeks called hubris makes Luke feel overpowerful, and then things go wrong. The tormented soul is killed by a policeman (Bradley Cooper). The end. The icon dies. The myth is re-created. The movie would just be a pale copy of Drive if it ended here. Fortunately, it doesn't. Even though Gosling's presence haunts the rest of the film, it is the policeman that replaces him as the lead character. The antihero is dead, the hero takes his place. After his act of bravery, everyone in the media and in the police pays tribute to Avery Cross. But Avery has a wife and a son just like Luke did, and that burdens his conscience. The whole movie is based on a parallel between the two men's fates. After a fifteen-year ellipsis during which none of the characters has aged (except poor Eva Mendes), the third part of the film follows Avery's and Luke's sons. Avery has divorced his wife and given up his job to get into politics, and AJ, his son, comes to live with him. In his new highschool, AJ (whom you want to slap the whole time) meets Jason, Luke's son. Neither of them knows the link that unites their fathers. But the truth untold kills slowly, and inevitably comes out. The end of the movie is a reflection on family secrets, on the past that you try to evade but that returns anyway, on destiny that links people and repeats itself, whether you want it or not. It might be a little strained and artificial at times, but in the whole it makes an interesting movie. Besides, Mike Patton did the music. That alone should convince you to go and see the film. The soundtrack is great, and it gives the movie its beauty, both deep and threatening, both violent and sad. Derek Cianfrance's filmmaking also oscillates between mainstream and abstract, particularly in a forest scene shot at full speed where the colors of the trees and the light of the sun blurr into something almost experimental (let's remember that Stan Brakhage was Cianfrance's teacher). The film is in-between. I can't find better words to describe it. And this in-betweeness is more a success than a failure.",The Place Beyond the Pines
351,FNDNreview,"Gosling, Cooper shine in The Place Beyond the Pines",8,23 April 2013,"Just when we were really getting to know Ryan Gosling, he's left the building. That's right, folks, Mr. Gosling has decided to take a break from acting. Much like Channing Tatum, Ryan Gosling has recently caught on with film-goers and has been the subject of heartthrob mania – mainly since he graced the big screen as the lead in 2004's The Notebook. But, is this the right move for Gosling? Has he already been overexposed to the general public? If anything, he has even broken the barrier to stardom. Gosling is clearly a well-rounded actor, but this could be a suicidal career move, especially since he was just finding his audience, with films like Drive, The Ides of March, and Gangster Squad. However, these films are far from box office breakout performances for Gosling. He's right on the cusp of being the next ""big thing"" in Hollywood – but suddenly he needs a break. Oh well. What's the saying? To each his own? In any event, The Place Beyond the Pines could very well be the last we see of Ryan Gosling for a while.Directed by Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine), The Place Beyond the Pines stars Ryan Gosling as Luke Glanton, a motorcycle stuntman that happens to visit his ex-lover, Romania (Eva Mendes), only to discover he's the father of her child. Determined to provide for the child, Luke begins robbing banks, but is eventually stopped by a rookie police officer, Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper). Flashing forward several years, Cross is running for Attorney General, while both Cross' and Glaton's sons wind up becoming friends in high school, unaware of the past between their fathers. Dane DeHaan, Emory Cohen, Rose Byrne, Bruce Greenwood, and Ray Liotta also star in supporting roles.The Place Beyond the Pines is quite simply one of the most well-written dramatic plots in quite some time. Pines is an ambitious film, to be sure – and what makes it so dramatically fulfilling and entertaining is the fact that it doesn't try to do more than it should with what it has. It's a simple story about two men, Glanton and Cross, and how their lives are destined to be intertwined with one another based on the choices that these two men make for themselves. Like most films should be, Pines clearly differentiates itself over the course of a three-part act. Gosling, Cooper, and the tandem of DeHaan and Cohen, each tell their own stories in order to bring the film full circle. One by one, you'll get to know these characters and understand their reasoning behind the choices they make, due in large part to the superior dialogue and prompt direction. There absolutely isn't enough praise for the direction from Derek Cianfrance, who also co-wrote the script, along with Ben Coccio and Darius Marder.As far as the acting goes, it's not as if there's really one specific actor that steals the show. Even though Gosling and Cooper both portray their characters to the best of their abilities, you can't help but question some of the choices these characters make. For instance, Gosling's character instantly gives up his job to help support his child? How is he supposed to support his child if he gives up his job? Bradley Cooper's character shoots a perp, yet lies about who shot first (Cooper's character did) – as if a perp pointing a gun at a police officer without firing is not enough justification to shoot first. We might as well call this the Han Solo/Greedo conundrum redux. Still, with these issues aside – Pines is really gets its breakout performance from new comer, Dane DeHaan. This buzz worthy performance as a loner searching for answers about his father is just the beginning of his soon to be busy movie career for you DeHaan.Overall, the small town setting in The Place Beyond the Pines is beautifully sculpted and perfectly captured to fit the demands of its story and characters. This is a character driven film with a series of twists, all of which lead up to the climactic grand finale. Rest assured, Pines is absolutely worth a visit to your local cinema, so if for some reason you're on the fence about seeing this film, you should definitely make it a priority before the summer juggernauts come to town.Overall Film Grade: B+",The Place Beyond the Pines
352,Milkybarkid104,A pleasant surprise!,8,14 January 2015,"Going into this movie I didn't know what to expect. I had heard mixed reviews and was intrigued by what I had heard, and you know what? It was a genuinely good movie. The cast is varied and has two very prestigious actors as the main characters. The seamless change between protagonists after the biker, played by Ryan Gosling, dies is to be admired and the psychological effects of events on the cop, played by Bradley Cooper, being only subtly worked in so they are noticed by the viewer is rather impressive. The movie superbly shows the truth behind corruption in the law and how far the people in charge can abuse their power, even though I suspect that may not have been their intention. Also, I thought about what I would give this as I watched the movie I tried to decide what I would give it, I decided on 8, however, as I watched the scene were I discovered the two son's were friends years later I decided for a nine as my mind was blown. The only reason it was not a 10 were some minor things along the movie, and I believe that very few movies are worth full marks.",The Place Beyond the Pines

The writing is more then good and the acting of all characters was well executed.

The acting is very good, Ryan Gosling proves once again that he can act, and Ray Liotta, though having only a minor role, he doesn't fail to deliver. Bradley Cooper's was not so great though, just average, but overall, the movie is very believable. One thing I didn't like though. I felt that the movie was made in a hurry. This is the kind of movie that needs to be at least 3 hours long, with more character development, but I will let that slide.If you enjoy Anthology Movies as much as I do, then I recommend this one.",The Place Beyond the Pines
356,ninka5121991,"Interesting at first, slow second half",2,9 November 2013,"Luke's downwards spiral and Cross's guilty conscience were compelling, and the lack of contrast between the two made it an interesting commentary on the media's and people's tendency to force situations into a right vs wrong, black and white mould. Luke being a bank robber with semi-noble intentions who simply couldn't accept that he'd couldn't have the life he wanted with his son and son's mother, vs Avery Cross being an ambitious cop who doubts his supposed heroism and almost lets himself go down the path of corruption, really makes you question who to root for and whether ""rooting for"" someone is the right way to go. The story of their sons, however, is hard to enjoy. While the idea that the effects of your actions don't stop at you or your generation holds water, and the way Luke's son and those that knew Luke cast Avery as the villain reflects the past treatment of Luke and the same error in perception, the characters' sons are so unlikable and have such poor judgment that the second half is hard to enjoy or appreciate.",The Place Beyond the Pines
357,scottied-256-552263,3 Acts in One,4,25 July 2018,"I'll split this review into three since this is basically three movies in one. Act 1: this act was the only one that was interesting. It dealt with the inner struggle of a man who was not brought up well and struggled to make good life choices when life demanded him to change. It dealt with the inner conflict of loving someone for their potential and then constantly being dissapointed. This act had action, drama, and great acting! I was on the verge of giving this movie an 8 when Act 2 entered the stage.Act 2: Terrible! The whole act is about making cops look like thugs wrapped in corruption at every level instead of the heroes they actually are. While some cops might be bad apples, this movie is out of control with the typical Hollywood propaganda of portraying cops as loopholing, scheming, law breaking, alcoholic, drug addicts. The act makes no sense and has no drama. The themes that were active in the first Act completely drop off the planet and we are met with superficial characters that do not represent real life. I gave this part a rating of 2.Act 3: This Act had potential. It nearly brought the movie back to above average. Instead they portrayed a kids who were incapable of making good choices. They portrayed high schoolers as out of control partiers, who rob stores, do drugs, and get plastered. And even with two loving parents of one of the kids who have brought him up with love and attention, he can't seem to make good choices and instead abandons his family completely after losing his mind. The act had potential themes to explore and just decided to superficially ignore any of them. They could have tied it back into the first Act and explored the dynamic of reversed roles in the child's lives. They could have explored the dynamic of overcoming peer pressure, overcoming bullies, or even growing up like the father and struggling to make good choices. Nope. I gave this Act a 4. Overall this movie was good at the beginning and quickly went downhill. They told three separate acts and instead of tying them together like good story tellers, they took the lazy route and just conveyed typical Hollywood crap.",The Place Beyond the Pines
358,veritasartsinc,Depressing Legacies,4,9 April 2013,"You can't escape your legacy. No matter what you do, you are doomed to reap what was sown by your fathers. That's the overall message of the depressing ""A Place Beyond the Pines"", where the bad choices of cops and robbers come back to bite them in the bum.Director Derek Cianfrance of ""Blue Valentine"", once again makes great use of Ryan Gosling who plays Luke--the epitome of the cool carny. In a wonderful, single take, opening tracking shot, we follow Luke--donning a leather jacket over his ripped, heavily tattooed body as he strolls toward the circus big top. Gosling exudes charisma as a daredevil motorcycle rider who is currently in Schenectady with a traveling circus.Things change when a haggard looking Romina (Eva Mendes) appears during one of Luke's post-show autographing sessions. They had a fling when the circus was in town last year and he offers her a ride back home. Apparently that's all she wants-- she's moved on and has a ""new man"". When Luke stops in to see her again before the circus shoves off, he finds out that the baby boy in Grandma's arms is his.Inexplicably stricken with new responsibility (isn't this an occupational hazard for carnies?), Luke gives up his circus gig to try to win back his girl and his baby. He moves in with a deadbeat mechanic (Ben Mendelsohn) who convinces him of the easy money to be made robbing banks. Naturally, Luke is ready for a piece of the action. The circus is gone and he has a mouth to feed doesn't he? Still with us? The stupidity continues unabated.Unfortunately, this is the best part of the film. For we are soon ""treated"" to two more vastly inferior stories. The first is of college grad cop, Avery (Bradley Cooper) who has a baby boy of his own and whose path crosses with Luke's. Avery then finds himself dealing with the corruption on the police force when a squad of bad apples (led by Ray Liotta) start forcing him to do cliché,""bad cop"" things. The result is predictable and boring.The third narrative in this overlong melodrama takes place 15 years later as the sons of Avery and Luke implausibly meet in high school, only to deal with the demons in their past, or the ""sins of the fathers"" if you will. If absolute stupidity in life choices is somehow supposed to endear us to these characters, Cianfrance fails miserably. In fact, they are stupid beyond credulity. I mean can you believe for a second that the clean cut, college educated son of a supreme court judge (Avery) has a son who talks and acts like a ghetto hood? No? Neither could I.If you have teenage sons, don't see this movie; your palms will itch with the desire to slap someone, as you observe the sheer inanity of these characters. Cianfrance certainly has taken on too much with these three stories. He would have been much better off, dealing with the first story line alone. Unfortunately the promise of the opening narrative dissipates quickly and we are left with an unconvincing melodrama of foolish choices and regrets, that is surprisingly banal.The photography is wonderful and the actors perform admirably but not even Gosling can save the cloddish script written by Cianfrance, Ben Coccio and Darius Marder--whose pessimistic view of humanity is neither original, nor is its presentation inspired.",The Place Beyond the Pines
359,joeburnes,A great movie stretched into a snooze fest,6,21 April 2013,"I can't deny everything said by the people who've rated this as a 10. What I can say is that this director put a lot of effort into the ""drama"" aspect of things. If, by ""drama"", you mean taking extended pauses between dialogs. At some times, so much so, that it is uncomfortable. I kept finding myself saying, ""come on, I get the point, now get on with it"". It's almost as if the director felt making a good movie required that it be 2 1/2 hours long. This movie definitely could have been reduced to 1 1/2 hours and wouldn't have lost a bit of quality. Now, the critics and the academy awards click will love this, but the average viewer will feel as I do. The movie has a great, albeit slightly predictable, plot. The acting is superb.

Before watching this film, I promised that I wouldn't compare it to the silent musical he featured in prior; Driven. I should have known better.The Place behind the Pines jumps from 1 year later to 15 years later and still leads you to a dead end. Just when you think this movie is about Gosling robbing banks to support his son, it makes a left turn and now we are thrown into a movie involving corrupt cops. As stated before, the movie then jumps 15 years a head in time to a screen play you could find on the Lifetime channel involving a father and his rebellious son. When the story tries to make it's explosive twist to bring all the stories together, you are left thinking; who cares and what does it matter....

The best I've heard that utilizes contemporary electronic music like witch house to its advantage. Sean Bobbit cinematography really, really impressive and very memorable. To operate in a spaghetti western changing of the protagonist style is very clever for the time and you don't see it often. The film was just, just slightly off point but it was so close to being unbelievable. Its third act was most likely its downfall.

I'm 34 years old now and since I was 5 years old I've seen pretty much every crime drama worth it's salt. Goodfellas, Casino, Heat, Carlito's Way, Donnie Brasco, Reservior Dogs, The Departed, etc etc. These movies in my opinion are the top tier of crime dramas, the best of the best. The Place Beyond the Pines is right up there at the same level as these movies i've just named, and in some aspects it's originality and superb writing and acting pushes it over the top. It is a travesty that this movie isn't getting RAVE reviews all over the place.

Second half of the story loses the power by trying to tell us much more than what was needed. Which causes a disconnection of the emotion and in moments makes it hard to relate or believe the story. Great part of the story is that it's not predictable (except of the part of the meeting of two kids). The twists in the story are surprising. Plus is also that throughout the whole movie the script has not been filled with cliché sentences in situations where you would expect it. The brilliance of the movie for me lied in a few key shots in situations of internal drama of actors (Luke realizing he is caught in the house, Avery being interviewed in hospital, Avery in psychiatrist office...). The shots were simple, long and realistic and put the audience in a role of an observer and enabled to feel the scene even without words. And of course a huge recognition goes to performance of Gosling and an amazing score by Mike Patton. All in all, simpler and less ambitious approach could have been more powerful but still it remains an above average movie because of the brilliance of the first part.",The Place Beyond the Pines
370,chrismartin181-1,Starts great but loses steam,7,25 April 2013,"The trailer to this film is rather misleading. It's the equivalent of advertising the whole of Disneyland with just clips of Space Mountain again and again. There's a lot more going on here than Ryan Gosling robbing banks and being a general badass in The Place Beyond The Pines. There are in fact at least three main characters all with their own story. And while the Ryan Gosling section is, a bit like Space Mountain at Disney, the best bit of the package he is only one part of a much bigger picture. A motor bike stunt rider finds out he has a son so packs in his day job and takes the logical step of robbing banks to provide for him. The story deals with the family life of the man as well as a rookie cop who exposes his police department to be corrupt. I found the film very absorbing from the start with Ryan Gosling's character development on fast forward so at least 3 massive life events all happen in the first 20 minutes of the film. There's not a lot of action scenes but when there are they're very tense and exciting. The family life aspect is quite heartwarming and you do believe that his character does love his son and wants to provide for him. There are fantastic believable acting performances all round here with Ryan Gosling and later on Bradley Cooper really showcasing their acting talents. It's engaging and I really cared what happened to both of their characters. The main problem with the film is it's length and not knowing when to stop. The first part of the film is constantly engaging and would be a nine out of ten if the film stayed like that the whole way through. When the focus shifts from characters however it really doesn't feel as exciting and almost feels like the start of totally different movie. A movie that isn't bad but is nowhere near as good as the one you've just seen.Every story told is linked obviously but sometimes it feels a tad loose. There is a dramatic time shift when the film reaches the 100 minute mark and what follows really seems to drag. It never really felt like it was going anywhere. It was by no means boring however, it just lost a bit of steam towards the end. The Place Beyond The Pines is worth a watch but just be prepared to have you're socks blown off and then have them planted firmly back on your feet as the film continues.",The Place Beyond the Pines
371,tomfoster-2,The Place Beyond the Pines is an enthralling film experience.,9,16 April 2013,"When leaving the cinema after seeing Derek Cianfrance's The Place Beyond the Pines, my mind had to reconnect with reality after being completely immersed in this film of epic scope, creativity and ambition. The Place Beyond the Pines is the reason I love movies, and is without a doubt one of the films that's going to be right up there with the very best, come the end of the year.Of course the film isn't without its faults. The film does overrun its running time and the film's third act doesn't quite reach the heights of the first two, but the movie's pure ambition is what makes you forgive and adore it even more. The film runs across two decades with a trilogy of stories about characters whose lives intersect and clash from both sides of the law. We begin in the nineties where Luke, a lowly stunt-biker (Ryan Gosling) working for a travelling circus finds out that he has a son by his former lover, Romina (Eva Mendes). Desperate to prove himself as a provider to his new-born child, he turns to robbing banks which sets in motion a collision course with a rookie cop, Avery (Bradley Cooper).Cianfrance's second feature film is a joy to watch; the direction, cinematography, writing and acting are finely tuned, delivering the audience an emotional and evoking masterpiece. It's a film which dares to take sharp, shocking turns, surprising you but nonetheless hooking you in more and more; eager to see where it's all going. Two confident leads in Gosling and Cooper guide the film through with the help of a strong supporting cast. Gosling borrows a sense of that brooding characteristic he had in Drive and throws it in with a character whose desperate to ensure that his child has a better upbringing than his own. Meanwhile Cooper plays an ambitious cop and like Luke, a newly father whose disheartened with the uncertain hero status cast upon him once colliding with Gosling as he finds himself surrounded by a corrupt system lamented in that of Deluca (Ray Liotta). As I mentioned the third act doesn't quite hold up to the first two, but nonetheless offers interesting ideas. The sons of Luke and Avery end up crossing paths which leads to exquisitely interesting situations and exchanges between the two, which you'll see the whole picture of when you watch the movie.Derek Cianfrance has constructed a crime epic; a story of fatherhood told from both sides of the law with fantastic performances, wonderful direction and a musical score by Mike Patton that will send shivers up your fingertips as your immersed in this rich world. When films like this are released, it reassures me that the film industry is still going strong – it maintains the artists who craft engaging and gripping epics which will linger with us long after the lights rise up in the cinema and we're journeying home, contemplating on what we've seen. The Place Beyond the Pines is an enthralling film experience.http://trashnoirreviews.wordpress.com/",The Place Beyond the Pines
372,armaan1502,The cast could be different!,7,28 October 2015,"I think the movie was great in terms of screenplay and script. The first half of the movie is too interesting with Ryan Gosling and his motorcycle mania. Eva acted good too as a supporting character but then when Bradley Cooper comes into the show and the movie loses its pace. Bradley is a great actor and he did very well but somewhere I think Jake Gyllenhaal could do it more precisely. The story gets a bit messy when Bradley's character get into trouble between the corrupted cops, I think Jake would have been an excellent cast in this role. Jake Gyllenhaal was great in Prisoners as a cop and I think he would have been excellent non the less it was a good movie, it had some sort of mystery from the beginning.",The Place Beyond the Pines
373,Phyxi,"Brilliant, and consuming",9,7 June 2013,"Hauntingly beautiful, and shot with exquisite mastery, Cianfrance's ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" has to be one of the best dramas that I have seen in a long time. While this film is quite lengthy, I feel that it is appropriate, for we enter quite a detailed narrative with many character arcs. Essentially, this film contains three narratives in one, and it is most interesting to witness as they diverge, then ultimately collapse into each other. The similarities between each of the character's stories are the relationships that Fathers have with their sons; and I really enjoyed being a witness to these relationships. There is a great sense of history repeating itself, of the need to be aware of the present and not of the past. Ryan Gosling, and Bradley Cooper, both provide stellar performances, while the locations used were superb. The costumes and lighting employed for scenes shot in the carnival, and the diner, created a grungy feel to the film, which I really enjoyed. The corresponding shots of nature, of sunsets, of forests, and of empty roads, created much needed space for reflection on life changing events that occur at such a heightened pace.",The Place Beyond the Pines

375,TheTruth747,Clichéd,1,20 April 2013,"Quite hard to digest that this movie is so highly rated. One is inclined to believe that the popularity of IMDb has led to star crazed fans feeling the urge to prop up the movie regardless of the content. Almost all the scenes in this movie are clichéd. Agreed that it's hard to invent scenes but the director or screenplay writer can at least try to innovate. The dialogues aren't anything great too. You've probably seen and heard it all - actually seen and heard it all in the exact same sequence even.The stand-out performer is Ryan Gosling, and he does quite well in the opening scenes. But even Ryan and Brad Cooper cannot redeem this movie, they have been let down pretty bad by a weak script. And there are a few scenes involving Eva Mendes which do not make sense at all. And the make-up artists for this movie do not deserve a place in Hollywood, they just don't. Even B-grade horror movies from the 80s had better make-up artists. Enjoy the trailer of this movie and try not to imagine how awesome the movie would be. It just isn't !",The Place Beyond the Pines

Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper together on screen, what's not to like? I did like it, but I didn't love it The movie starts off with so much potential, brilliant cast, beautifully shot and lots of promise. The first part of the movie provides the level of entertainment you would expect, but then as the film progresses it starts to crumble, to a point where it needs an immaculate ending to put it right. But unfortunately for me, that ending didn't happen, and I walked away a little dissatisfied. The cast was perfect, but the characters were not developed enough - this was seen mainly in the sons, this was where it crumbled the most for me. The two actors were great, but the characters were not, and this was the whole point to the story, the preceding two parts were leading us to these two characters, and for me, they were not strong enough to carry that.

377,SundayDumbDay,Phenomenal Film that deserves more praise!,9,17 April 2013,"I will start with this, Incredible! I have not seen anything like this for a long, long time. Everything, from the acting to the cinematography to the music was phenomenal. The Place Beyond the Pines was a very difficult movie to watch though. The range of emotions you feel throughout out are just..soul moving. Be prepared for an awe-inspiring, tear jerking roller coaster. I know this movie will be nominated for Best Picture.The pacing was eerily slow in the beginning, and that isn't a bad thing in this case because there is building tension that starts to rise with the different actions on the screen. Everything the Director shows us is methodically placed and every shot is meticulously executed to make us feel this slow rising tension. Then about 25-30 minutes into the movie the pacing spikes and your heart starts to race. Just before you're chest explodes the pacing is abruptly slowed and you start to ease down. Then the whole process starts again.The music is so sweet yet melancholy at times that you drift in and out of a kind of daze with what's happening in the movie. Fantastic!I do not understand why there are so many reviews that feel this was not a good film. See it and make your own decision.

In either case to do so with this film is pointless; its pieces glide effortlessly together painting a complex tapestry of human causality while avoiding potential pitfalls such as rhetoric or overt opinion.This movie is an opportunity to see your reflection; in that it does not distort or attempt to distort the viewer's perception.

There are some unique and uncommon emotions that are dealt here and this is not a typical heist or crime flick like the storyline might suggest. The first section belongs to the character played by Ryan the second section of the movie revolves around the character played by Bradley Cooper and the third section is about the sons of the above mentioned characters. Each of these section is strong and well written and well played out, like I mentioned there isn't a dull moment. This is one of those underdog movies that will take you by surprise. Top notch performance from Ryan Gasling, Bradley cooper, Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen. Congratulations to the producer and the crew. Well Done!",The Place Beyond the Pines
380,joedavo96,Perfection.,10,24 June 2013,"Derek Cianfrance has now proved himself as a true visionary. After seeing his riveting romantic drama Blue Valentine, a film that follows the deteriorating marriage of two of the best actors working today - Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams, I was excited to see what Cianfrance would come out with next. I had huge expectations for The Place Beyond The Pines and I was not disappointed, if anything I was amazed at the sheer brilliance of this film, I walked away from this movie knowing that I had just experienced something special. I recommend going into this film with as little knowledge as possible, just sit back and enjoy the ride. With outstanding performances, a beautiful score, an engaging script and simply perfect direction from Cianfrance, The Place Beyond The Pines is a masterpiece and easily one of the greatest films I have ever had the pleasure of watching.",The Place Beyond the Pines
381,maxthehalford,Steam rolls well until Bradders appears,6,6 October 2013,"Oh dear what calamity has arisen with this movie? Lets start with the good. The beginning of the movie is great. It has tone, feel and tension, especially with the bank heists. Coupled with good cinematography and a good musical overlay it really feels good. Yes its a lot like Drive in those respects but I don't think there is anything wrong with that and if you like Ryan Gosling and his mysteriously sulking characters then you will thoroughly enjoy the first forty five minutes.But then cue Mr Bradley Cooper and the whole thing spirals towards the ground screaming blue murder. This isn't Bradleys fault but it is definitely where the pace is lost. The problem is that you are emotionally invested in the Eva Mendes and Ryan storyline and it seems to end to prematurely with a complete lack of beauty that was promised with the preceding shots. The storyline then changes to one centred around police corruption which does not fit the tone of the film at all. In addition to this the film kept on seeming like it was going to end and then didn't. This meant you lost interest as you were not really bothered what happened. This feeling was further expounded upon when the sons stories were introduced. I get it the director wanted to show that your actions don't just affect you, they affect those from years onwards. However this point was laboured and took too long to come round. All in all the film should have just stuck with what it promised in its trailers as opposed to the weird three film meld we ended up with. I gave the score as a six but that is purely for the first forty minutes. The rest could be good as a separate movie but it did not belong here.",The Place Beyond the Pines
382,sig777-898-850492,Avoid,2,9 May 2014,"This movie is actually three movies in one, each one equally as bad as the next, the worst two being the first (the sulky looser bank robber) and the third (the even more sulky and boring sons; with a ton of mediocre acting thrown in). The middle part with Bradley Cooper is only just slightly more palatable.The whole thing just seems so pointless to me. If there is supposed to be some life lesson or irony in the movie somewhere then it's completely lost on me. So there is no life lesson, no entertainment value (drama or otherwise) and three dull stories. The storyline is so thin and predictable, with perhaps the transition from movie one to movie two being the only nice surprise twist. Movie three had me in pain begging for it to end as it was basically about two mind-numbingly dumb junkies with the only suspense being the bit in the forest and the five minutes leading up to it. And at the end, the whole motorbike thing, ""have you ever ridden a bike before? Vrooom"" Oh come on! And another sulky boring character drives off into the sunset hopefully never to be seen again. Why not make one decent movie instead of making three mediocre short movies and trying to combine them into one and bring down the overall level from mediocre to poor? As for the characters in the movie, did I care about any of them? No, they were all complete douches. Not one of them was a nice person and it seems as if the film makers went out of their way to get us to dislike every character and thus ultimately the movie. Avoid, and save yourself over two hours of agony. Oh yes, Ryan Gosling should perhaps consider a career change after this movie.",The Place Beyond the Pines

385,trinigeleon,I tried....,4,15 May 2013,"I did. I really did try to enjoy this film. Unfortunately, I found the pacing far too slow and the characters far from captivating.The only character I found remotely interesting was Bradley Cooper's. Indeed, his character's development in the film was the one high point for me. Eva Mendes did a good turn as the single mom, as did Ray Liotta in the corrupt cop role, but ultimately their characters were just two dimensional. And, dare I say it, I suspect Ryan Goslin can't act. Every performance I have seen from him is the same flat, monotone, emotionless reading. I will give him credit for the bank robbery scenes however. The fact that his voice breaks up an octave or two during these scenes made them seem much more real to me. Perhaps he should fire his agent who seems determined to only forward him the romantic lead / dark, brooding hero-type roles when his forte, perhaps, lies elsewhere.Other reviews have said that this is a film in 3 acts. I couldn't bring myself to finish act 2, despite my appreciation of Bradly Cooper's character.Normally, on an evening, I will lie in my bed, put on a film and curse my lack of sleep in the morning. Not in this instance. The only time I could imagine enjoying this film would be if I'd had an especially evil day at work and my wife brought home the DVD for us to watch.

386,annecoyle06,Work of Art,9,11 January 2014,"I am so glad I stumbled across this on HBO (only because my husband wanted to watch it.) I was feeling charitable so generously offered to give it a try. Wow. I'm not sure what i was expecting since I am not sure I had ever heard of this movie before. But it is a very high- quality film and not what one would expect if you saw the poster or read the first line or two of the plot. Do yourself a favor: do not read any plot summaries or you will deprive yourself of the artful and clever unfolding. To repeat my reaction to this movie -- one I never intended to see but am so glad i did -- WOW. Bradley Cooper is amazing, of course, but so everyone else, especially the young new star, Dane DeHaan. Just as soon as you think you know what the movie is about, you need to reassess. If you are drawn to movies featuring thrilling bank robberies, this movie may perplex and even disappoint you. If you are interested in the complexity of the human experience -- especially the concept of justice and the nature of father/son relationships-- see it now. This is no formulaic, Hollywood movie. A lot of care and attention went into every detail, from the on-location scenes shot in upstate New York to pitch-perfect casting to mood-inducing music. But it's the story that grabs you and the story -- and fascinatingly flawed characters -- that hold you until the end.Our teenaged daughter watched it with us and said it was the best movie she has seen in at least a year, if not longer.",The Place Beyond the Pines
387,kambizs,Narrative of life: A review of 'The Place Beyond the Pines',9,19 March 2014,"The first thing you will notice when you watch ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is that despite all differences between this movie and the director's previous films, it's still a movie by Derek Cianfrance, who seems to have an invisible signature that puts his mark on every single movie he makes. This signature is nothing but a desert between relationships. His characters are all alone, maybe not physically, but deep down inside their soul and in their definition of love and life.Like ""Blue Valentine,"" this film is still about relationships, human connection, and a kid involved in the conflict of the relationship. But unlike ""Blue Valentine,"" which had hidden violence, here the audience is faced with justified violence that Cianfrance completely prepares his audience for from the beginning of the movie. The tattoos on Ryan Gosling's arm, his job as an entertainer on a motorcycle, and the way he smokes in the beginning of the film, which remind viewers of the western Clint Eastwood movies, all tell us that we will see a movie that shows violence.In ""Blue Valentine,"" the violence has been hidden under the acts of characters and has become a cold violence that still hurts but is not obvious. For example, the sex scene between Bobby and Cindy, which provides a disillusioned violence, leads to silence, a silence (suppressed violence) that covers the whole sky of the narrative with a giant dark cloud.The scene at home between the mother, the father and Cindy confronts the same picture but in a different way. The father starts to complain about food and there is the silence that Cianfrance wants us to pay attention to when the camera moves toward Cindy. The violence finally opens like an old wound and Dean breaks and crashes everything, and after that again silence, the silence that, as the audience, we cannot be sure of when it will start to be a storm again. In that scene, Dean seems to be vomiting the explosion of his anger. He is throwing up all the silence and anger that covered the whole atmosphere of the film. He yells instead of all the characters.This role, in ""The Place Beyond the Pines,"" was assigned to the young Jason. When he points the gun, which was his fathers', he doesn't yell or scream. He is looking at Avery with an anger that comes from all the characters of the movie, comes from all their loneliness and pain.Guns are everywhere in ""The Place Beyond the Pines."" They are playing an important role in the narrative of the film. Weapons in this movie are not just a symbol of violence, even though much of the violence in the film arises from them, but they also have characters. Each gun changes the personality of each character to turn him into an aggressive person, something that without a doubt can be called a living weapon. The guns bring regret, and lack of control for whoever the person became and an unknown future for each of them.This is the reason that, unlike ""Blue Valentine,"" here we are not dealing with flashbacks. Characters are moving forward without looking back. Cianfrance, in an interview with Alex Belington, says that the movie is like a gun. When you fire the gun, there is no looking back on it and there is no chance to pause. The bullet goes forward as fast as it can.The characters' choice of life affects others' lives, but not in a good way. Having many options, they have picked an aggressive one because they had to, even if we'd say, as the audience, that there could have been a wiser choice. In those circumstances, there was barely another choice as the story has been set up.""The Place Beyond the Pines"" begins with violence, continues with violence but ends with silence. Cianfrance knows how to play with these two and take the audience wherever he wants. Like the previous movie, ""Blue Valentine,"" in the final scene, the character, like a lonely cowboy, leaves everything behind and turns his back to the camera and goes to an unknown future.",The Place Beyond the Pines

So, go see ""The Call"", which had a strong female character, and the majority of the major characters are minorities, and it twists the ideas of basic mainstream Hollywood concepts, where they put a black woman in the main character set and she saves a white girl, pitting herself against a white antagonist.

Ryan Gosling's one expression throughout his part? Even when he clocks the father of his child or the overhead shot of him dead after getting shot and falling out of the window? I mean, this guy is a popular actor, and I know he probably adores James Dean and Brando, but please, crack a smile or frown once in a while. What else? Oh yeah, after his partner in crime tells him he's done robbing banks, Gosling's character goes it alone, and (of course) muffs the entire robbery, only to end up shot by a cop who stalks Gosling in the house he tries to hide out in ALONE. Didn't see that coming, did you? Hello? Any cops out there going after an armed robber alone in strange house, no backup, no idea who else might be in the house? Seriously. Then onto the bumpy career in law enforcement of Bradley Cooper's dimwitted character. Again, really? We're supposed to believe a guy this dumb ends up as the DA? I'll spare you the coming-of-age blather we are supposed to care about between the Cooper's son and the boy fathered by Gosling, and the ham-handed irony that I'm sure the director thought would bowl us over.

It is more suitable for theater than for the big screen. If the story was told using retrospection, it would have kept me in suspense throughout the whole 2 hours 15 minutes.Nevertheless, the three separate stories are interesting, but they might just as well have been separate 40-minute long movies. The transition between the first two was fine, but it was non-existing when transitioning into the third part. A few facts were hidden from the viewer which I found confusing. The acting was good too and so was the directing as well.What I took from this movie is how an event from the past (which you had no control of but own the blame for) can come back and haunt you 15 years later. It also showed how an ambitious father can lose control over what is happening with his own family (wife & child).",The Place Beyond the Pines
394,amira_badawey,Pining for Ryan Gosling,10,9 April 2013,"I intended to see The Place Beyond The Pines upon viewing the preview for the first time. The image of Ryan Gosling speeding into the tree lined horizon of upper New York was mesmerizing. I was curious to find out what he will bring to the character. Then, mixed reviews came in. Everyone praised Gosling's performance, he never disappoints, yet most found the three part vignettes disjointed and that the movie ran too long. With the film in limited release, I wondered if it was worth venturing out to Manhattan to see it. As my enthusiasm wavered and the film descended to the bottom of my to-see queue, I came across James Franco's review in the Huffington post. Franco's post about The Place Beyond The Pines is poignant, exhilarating and downright beautiful. He paints a vivid picture of Gosling (The Gos). He masterfully crafts each sentence in appraising the performance both individually and collectively. After reading the review, I too wanted to make love to the movie. Having availability this weekend, I decided to dedicate three hours to the appreciation of the Gos. With every scene, Franco's voice echoed in my head as if he was sitting right there whispering the film's narrative into my ear.Despite being a bit long, with an over indulgent mid-section, The Place Beyond The Pines is an enjoyable experience. Having read the reviews prior to seeing the movie, I had a feed-forward on the events and the story's progression. This, however, did not diminish from the film's magnificence. Gosling evokes a magnitude of emotions. I swooned, I smiled, and I cried. Gosling's rendition of the troubled soul but good at heart Luke is so consuming, you crave him in every scene. I wonder how different Bradley Cooper's chapter would have been if Gosling was cast in the role. I was eager to see him spar with Ray Liotta. Not to fault Cooper, for it is refreshing to see him convey other sentiments rather than disdain from behind his Hangover glasses. But how can he follow Gosling's performance - no one can. In large part, this is the reason Cooper's vignette seems over drawn. However, Cooper was successful in getting the audience to dislike Avery despite sympathizing with his character.The Place Beyond The Pines plays like an inverted sandwich, with the dull stale slice of bread encased between two meat patties. The last portion of the movie is a powerful bookend to Gosling's chapter, bringing together the fate of our antagonistic protagonists. The film's major premises, as Franco so eloquently states, is a Shakespearean Sins of our Fathers. It begs the question, are we destined to follow in the footsteps of our fathers regardless how much or how little influence they had in our lives? As if our destiny is decided by our genes not our actions. The movie also touches on the dichotomy of good and bad, more of the contrast between what society, and perhaps the viewer, deems as good or bad and the intentions of individuals. We often set out to do good, but in a bad way with the notion of the ends justify the means. However, when is this conflict accepted both publicly and privately. This brings us to another theme, conforming to society. The more we conform and assimilate with the masses, the more forgiving people will be of our sins. As opposed to loner stoners who do what they want as they deem appropriate. Society more readily judges and prosecutes their sins because they are viewed as renegades and outsiders. The Place Beyond The Pines raises the question, which of our two antagonistic heroes will die with a clear conscience.After reading Franco's post, I was hesitant to publish this review. My writing could never so articulate my sentiment in such a profound manner as Franco's review. Whenever I try to wean myself off this Franco crush, he does something so admiral that elevates him to new heights, so admiral that he would serenade the performance of a fellow actor and pine for the Gos! If The Place Beyond The Pines is not on you must-see list, may I suggest that you read Franco's review and then decide. I guarantee that you'll speed out the door in search for a showing upon reaching the last words - Burn Hard Baby!http://amiraknowsbest.blogspot.com/",The Place Beyond the Pines

I'd really love to see it again knowing the shape to expect and not have that small doubt that kicked in just over halfway through.Each new act brings a wider sense of perspective to the events so far. Bradshaw's review in the Guardian called it ""operatic"" and I think that's probably a good description. I've been writing an essay about plot all week, so the structure of this film felt like a bit of a reward!This is Ryan Gosling's best performance yet, probably. This or Blue Valentine. It's no coincidence that this is the same director of that film, Derek Cianfrance, he must have a way with actors, or at least this actor. Gosling's Luke is a very vulnerable little boy hiding behind a stunt-bike-riding front. When he discovers a fling from a year before has resulted in a child, he fundamentally misunderstands what it is he needs to provide for his newly discovered family, a mistake which drives the plot of the whole film.Bradley Cooper plays a cop, Avery, struggling with the world of police corruption over the course of the film's second act. In balance with Gosling's character, he encapsulates the film's themes of morality, fatherhood, and masculine vulnerability. The third act allows us to see how the effects of these fathers' actions play out over a longer period of time. Avery's full and honest understanding of the ramifications of his past is powerfully painful.Eva Mendes is also fantastic, there are some truly heartbreaking moments that she plays to their full even when she's not central in the shot. She doesn't upstage, she's actually quite understated, but is perfect as the thread that hold the three acts together and maintains the parallels between them.There are plenty of such parallels throughout the film, which play out as you watch it, and I don't need to spoil for you here. The film this most reminded me of was Brokeback Mountain. There's a similar aesthetic, as well as its grand structure arching over decades. Gosling's performance reminded me of Heath Ledger's in that film, understated, internal, but managing to say an awful lot nevertheless.I really believe this film will stand up to multiple viewings, I already want to see it again. It's the kind of film that deserves to become a modern classic; high production values, wonderful performances, and a beautifully structured plot.",The Place Beyond the Pines

398,realreviews72,Excellent Movie- Typical Oscar Snub,9,25 February 2014,"I absolutely find the Oscar Awards to be an utter sham. They are rarely an accurate reflection of the best film or acting performance of the year. I suspect nominees are chosen based upon deeply political and personal criteria and have very little to do with merit. Each year the nominations come out, each year there are obvious films and actors not even considered and some considered that make you scratch your head. The only thing I know about the criteria to be eligible is that the film must be released in the U.S. in a minimum of theatres between January 1 and December 31. Beyond that, I have no idea who or how nominees are chosen. Does anyone??? OK, that rant is out of the way. So explain to me how in the world was this movie overlooked? You cannot tell me that Wolf of Wall Street, Captain Philips, Her or American Hustle were better films than this. I know this was not mass distributed and I suppose there are people who could understand or follow this; but that's why they make the 'Captain Philips' type movies. They are out there to appeal to a specific segment of the population. That is not a bad thing. Baskin Robbins has 31 flavors for a reason- options. But does making a film popular make it 'Oscar' worthy? The Oscar Committee has expanded the number of nominations it makes and STILL it neglects deserving movies in favor of the popular one. Aren't the Oscar awards be given for the 'Best' of something? This was a wonderful film. It can be broken down into three parts- really, three linked stories. The first story is about a motorcycle circus performer who finds out he is a father and sets out on a life of crime to support his son and mother of his baby. The second is the rise of an ambitious cop turned attorney fighting against the corruption of those around him. And third, a relationship between two boy whose father's operate on different sides of the law and are forever linked by one day. On the surface this movie seems to not be connected in anyway but as you walk out of the theatre it makes you wonder how you doubted it all.I need for someone to explain to me what about this movie was so horrible that it wasn't nominated for a single Oscar? Or perhaps you can explain to me how it was ineligible for Oscar consideration? I am really trying to figure that out.",The Place Beyond the Pines

The only high point of the movie was Ryan Gosling's performance, which came as a surprise because I watched it hoping for something interesting from Bradley Cooper, but his role will simply put you to sleep. Unfortunately Ryan only appears in the first half of the movie, and nobody steps forward to fill the vacuum. Thus the movie plays much as though there was a revolt half way through filming, with the director and lead actor leaving, with a much less capable director charged with completing the movie with a dispirited and decimated cast.Bottom line: Not even worth the Netflix download time.",The Place Beyond the Pines

I could not pick Ryan Gosling out of a lineup before I saw this movie, but I thought his performance (minus the high pitched squealing during robberies) was fantastic. His character had a quiet energy and even though he didn't speak all that much I think he was the star performance in the movie. I was sorry to see him die with all that movie left. The other performances were average and the story was OK, but Gosling really shined in his brief appearance. The story had a sort of ""domino effect"" to it with consequence after consequence resulting as effect of the first part of the movie. Moderately unique, good acting and a decent story.

In this movie, Mr Gosling is quickly killed, leaving Bradley Cooper (not a favourite for me) to finish the long remainder of the action. This immediately put me off. I could not watch the movie to the end. The two leading characters (Gosling and Cooper) meet in a police chase only for a few minutes, in which Mr Gosling is shot dead. To my mind, this felt like a 'cheat' a 'trick'... since I did not know about it beforehand. So, if you - like me - want to see Mr. Gosling, I suggest you give this one the skip.

Gosling and Cooper had a great presence on screen and I believed their characters and acting. There were some very cool camera shots in this that I absolutely loved. I especially loved Dane DeHaan (from Chronicle). He really played his character well and I can't wait to see what else he makes in the future. I would definitely give this a watch. It's got a love story, action, thrills, suspense, crime, everything all in one movie. It could have been just a LITTLE shorter but the movie wraps up nicely and was a great watch.

408,cricker03,2/3 epic movie 1/3 just OK (last few sentences sum up all),7,19 April 2013,"The movie is broken into three parts, the first being the story of Ryan Gosling, the 2nd being the story of Bradley Cooper, and the 3d is what happens as a result of the decisions they made. The first hour is by far the best part of the movie, and the 2nd part is also really good. The third act just seems to drag on a little bit. I think they tried to cover to much length of time for a reasonable screen duration. If i could change one thing about this movie, I would cut up the editing, so that the first act is constantly revisited visually throughout the movie until the end, and the third act is introduced in the beginning and the middle of the movie, sort of like pulp fiction. I think if they would have added scenes from the third act randomly throughout the first 2 hours of the movie, that by the time you got to the end, you would still be just as surprised, but the movie would have wrapped up much better. I've heard people say this should have been a trilogy, it shouldn't have been, but they could have edited differently. The movie goes into high gear from the beginning, then sort of evens out, then tends to drag on. Even though the movie tends to drag on at the end, you know that it's building towards something and wrapping up all it's loose ends, but in a very bad comparison it's like the godfather trilogy, the first part is amazing, the 2nd part is just as good, and the third part, although you want to see where everything ends up it's just not what you hoped it would be. It doesn't mean the last part is bad, it just means the movie feels like it starts if 5th gear, filled with passion, romance, violence, action, then sort of down-shifts into a steady coast, and then at the end you kind of feel like you're in bumper to bumper traffic, and after 2 hours of sitting in the same spot, and a giant soda later, you're kind of just waiting for it to end. STILL: EXCELLENT MOVIE, just go in with the right expectations. SUBTEXT: what people will do for their children, politics on both sides of the law, and what can come as a result of being the bad guy trying to be good, the good guy adjusting his moral compass, and what happens years later.",The Place Beyond the Pines
409,erireynolds,"Fatherhood, legacy, and the effects of our actions. (Spoiler Free)",8,19 April 2013,"A generational crime drama giving us a look into how our actions, and their consequences, shape our futures and affect the lives and futures of our families, The Place Beyond the Pines has definitely earned the title of ""most ambitious film of the year."" Derek Cianfrance has a way of getting great performances out of his stars and is a very talented writer, so I assumed that this would be no different than Blue Valentine, in those aspects. The amount of realism in his characters and the emotional resonance they leave on you are achieved like very few other directors can do, nowadays. You get a very personal look into them. Pines is about a carnival motorcycle stuntman named Luke (Ryan Gosling) who, after one of his shows, runs into a woman he once had a casual fling with, Romina (Eva Mendes). Upon discovering she fathered his child that he never knew of, he decides to quit his job and be there for his newly found family because he doesn't want his song growing up without his father the way he did. After realizing he does not have the financial stability to support them, he decides to start robbing banks with help from his new boss, Robin (Ben Mendelsohn), and this is how his life starts to intersect with Avery's (Bradley Cooper), the rookie police officer chasing him, and both of their lives are forever altered.Once the second act starts, the narrative focuses on Cooper and his family (just like the first act focused on Gosling and his family), and how he's dealing with corruption within his department. Cooper's character provides us with the morality of the film and shows us male vulnerability, in contrast to Gosling's character. This is definitely one of Cooper's best performances and he has made almost a flawless switch from comedy to serious drama. The third act takes place 15 years later and now focuses on the lives of both of their sons, and how their fathers' actions from the past have impacted them. Fate plays a role in the film. Eva Mendes also gave what could possibly be her best performance ever. While her character wasn't on-screen too often, she was the thread that binds the bones. She held the story lines together. And she did a damn good job of not overacting the emotional scenes, they were very genuine and believable. Jennifer (Rose Byrne) was very underused in the film.Ryan Gosling has mastered the type of character that has minimal dialogue and conveys his emotions and what he has to say through facial expressions and body language. You can tell Luke is a damaged man with a violent past. This is another great performance from Ryan. The film is so electric when Gosling is on-screen, and Cianfrance masterfully captured every chase scene, it just feels purely exhilarating. But that's also one of the biggest reasons the film feels so much slower when he's not on-screen. The energy is down. But, that doesn't mean the pacing was bad at all. I actually thought the pacing was exactly how it needed to be (although I know some have complained about its 2hr 20min runtime). A lot of people have said it would have worked better as a trilogy rather than a single film with all three stories rolled into it, and I agree but I also don't agree. The story felt like it needed to be longer to let each individual storyline build itself up even more and provide more details, but at the same time it didn't because, like I said, it was three generations in one.The film had a very gloomy tone and mood to it. But that's exactly the type of feel and atmosphere I like. I'm a big fan of depressing dramas, and this was definitely that; but it was compelling. I thought the score (composed by Mike Patton) fit the film just right and I really enjoyed it--especially the song ""Snow Angel"" (the main song used throughout the film). It was haunting, yet striking. The cinematography (done by Sean Bobbitt, Hunger, Shame, and soon-to-be 12 Years A Slave) was beautiful; every shot was excellent and very well-edited, too. Almost every scene was gorgeous to look at. I appreciated the camera-work a great deal. Visually gorgeous. It was a cinematic poem.Overall, I thought the film was a great telling of father-son relationships, legacy and men trying to find their identities. Shows the lengths we'll go to take care of our families. It gives a stark look into fatherhood and how what you do can influence the ones around you, positively or negatively, so always keep that in mind in your everyday lives. My only gripe with the film is the energy dialing down a notch when Gosling was not in the frame, but that is absolutely not enough to warrant this a ""bad"" film whatsoever. Cooper helps carry it a ton during that time, as well. I wasn't sure how the plot, and structure of it, was going to hold up after the second act, but it was interesting to see everything play out and how it all came together at the end; it worked. I believe it is one of the best films of 2013, so far. It is a story filled with adrenaline rushes, love, heartbreak, suspense, consequence, how one moment can change everything forever, and, most importantly, a story about family. A beautiful tragedy.""If you ride like lightning, you're going to crash like thunder.""",The Place Beyond the Pines
410,andrewdu24,Shallow and inconsistent,5,22 July 2013,"Eh, it started out well. Ryan Gosling played a stunt driver who finds out he has a 1 year old son with Eva Mendez and decides to quit and build a life with them but she already has a man. But for some reason Ryan Gosling gets into the picture anyway. Its unclear what Eva Mendes's character thinks about Gosling and nothing is shown about her new relationship. Gosling decides he needs money to provide for them and starts robbing a bunch of banks(even though they seem to be doing just fine). He does spend some time with his son but oversteps his boundaries and then assaults Eva Mendes's boyfriend/husband? She cuts him off and he goes back to bank robbing and is chased by Bradley Copper. Ryan Gosling dies during the chase and Bradley Cooper is racked with guilt. He is treated as a hero but feels conflicted because he also has a 1 year old son who he can't look into the eye do to guilt. The second act of the movie deals with police corruption and resolves itself in a way that undermines the feelings I had about Bradley Cooper's character. The third act is the worst. First of all, its set 15 years later and Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper's offspring meet and there are violent consequences. Both young men are lost and angry but there is no depth given to them. Eva Mendes is aged considerably but Bradley Copper is not. Eva Mendes' son does not look part Latino at all or anything like Ryan Gosling. His character acts like hes from a different movie. His confrontations with Bradley Copper and his son make little to no sense. The characters lack motivation and are not consistent. In one scene both young men seem to be social outcasts in another one appears to be very popular. One one scene Bradley Copper's character appears to be moral the next scene he only cares about himself.",The Place Beyond the Pines

A powerful tale of fathers and sons that hits close to home for any parent and sinks its hooks deep into you that stay there long after the credits roll. Writer/Director Derek Cianfrance made this movie for artistic and personal reasons and you feel that when you watch it. This is a movie that matters and carries the epic ambition of a renegade filmmaker and Cianfrance has the cast to back up his words and direction.The cast is top notch in every role down to the bit parts and glimpses. The film is carried by them all, but the heart and soul of the film are Gosling and Cooper. Their screen time together is extremely short, but the intertwined lives of Luke and Avery make you feel like their faceoff lasted longer in legacy.Every scene bristles with imminent and infinite ominous intensity like you are watching a car spiral out of control. Cianfrance is a marvel with the camera here, never letting us forget that what we are seeing is memorable and is poised to rock our souls.

419,nick_krivak,Brilliant Surprise and rather genius,9,13 July 2014,"The Place Beyond The Pines is a fantastic movie. Very well written and very smart if you follow it properly. It is broken up into three different parts, each part leading into the next until they all come together brilliantly at the end to create a beautiful finish.It starts off with Luke, played by Ryan Gosling, a lonely and careless motorcycle stunt rider. He lives his life day by day alone and on the edge performing dangerous stunts on his prized dirt bike, in which he refers to as part of the family. He is then confronted out of nowhere by his ex-lover, Romina, played by Eva Mendes, who eventually tells him he has a baby boy.Luke then quits his job to be more responsible in an attempt to mend things with Romina. He wants to be there for them and provide for his son. He turns to robbing banks to correct his money situation but it soon affects him mentally when he gets in too deep. He winds up in a police pursuit for his life being chased by the newly introduced Avery, played by Bradley Cooper.The consequences soon lead Luke to a house occupied by 2 strangers in which Avery chases him into and corners him. They confront each other and surprisingly Gosling ends up dead on the sidewalk. One would normally find this irritating as he was supposed to be the main character but he is important in another way.His character's death leads Cooper into the 2nd part of the movie where the screenplay shows you a world of corrupt police officers. Cooper almost gets himself killed being apart of their game for a short period of time and his punishment soon leads him into the same metal collapse that Gosling experienced with the exception of him not dying.The 3rd act then comes up ""fifteen years later"" when Cooper's son and Gosling's son are all grown up, for the most part anyway. Both being around the age of 17 they are both trouble causing teenagers who end up meeting each other and becoming close with each other through the common experience of being robbed of attention from their fathers.I won't give anything away with this act or anything else in the movie. I will however say I highly recommend seeing this genius creation. I was completely surprised but in a good way. All actors in the film were fantastic and the movie was created beautifully throughout. All 3 acts come together perfectly to create a perfect ending to an almost flawless movie.Keep in mind this movie is a drama so don't go into it expecting to see chase scene after chase scene as the trailer shows. Just appreciate the movie for what it is, good old classic well developed plot with great supporting actors to go with it.I give this movie a 9 and highly recommend seeing this movie. I hope this review was helpful to all and if not then I apologize. Enjoy.",The Place Beyond the Pines

421,mfontaine2,Two Thumbs Up,9,11 December 2013,"Derek Cianfrance's 'Place Beyond the Pines' is an extremely poignant story, which focuses on family, the decisions that people may make in life, and the implications of these actions.The film follows the story of Luke (Ryan Gosling), a motorcycle stunt- rider as he desperately tries to mend his relationship with Romina (Eva Mendes). Their relationship gets much more complicated when Romina reveals that she had a child, and that it is Lukes. Desperate to prove to Romina that he can be a capable provider for his new family, Luke turns to robbing banks. The story takes a drastic turn when Luke's outlaw lifestyle causes him to cross paths with the ambitious rookie police officer, Avery (Bradley Cooper). Cianfrance masterfully twists the plot by taking the story 15 years into the future, and focuses on the life of Avery's troubled son, AJ (Emory Cohen). AJ's story begins on his first day at a new high school where he meets the awkward outcast Jason (Dane Dehaan), who turns out to be Luke's son. The remainder of the film focuses on how their father's past actions have directly affected the lives of their sons.One thing I found particularly enjoyable about this film was the use of a variety of different shots that are not typically seen in traditional Hollywood films. Cianfrance uses an array of dynamic over the shoulder and high-angle action shots while Luke races down the highway as he outruns the pursuing police officers. These novel methods of shooting film provide an aesthetic appeal, giving a star-studded film an indie vibe.Another aspect of this film I found extremely enjoyable was the non- traditional approach Cianfrance takes in presenting a linear story plot. I personally find linear story lines somewhat predictable and boring, but this in not the case for Place Beyond the Pines. You follow three separate-yet interrelated stories, which Cianfrance manages to link together creating an extremely exciting, coherent and cohesive story. The film is riddled with plot twists that leave the viewer guessing ""what will happen next?"" throughout. I highly recommend this film to anyone in the mood for something out of the ordinary- a deviation from the traditional Hollywood blockbuster",The Place Beyond the Pines
422,gammerguy,a trilogy in one film,10,24 January 2014,"I mean wow what a terrific film. There's many great things about this film.The acting and the cast is great. Bradley Cooper should have a Oscar for this film. Even Eva Mendes is good in this film and you don't see that everyday. Everybody acts real and feel like real persons. There's no big acting moment like in a typical Oscar film, it was very subtle to know what emotion the characters feels. the story itself is basically three films in one, and that's not a bad thing because each act is solid in there own way. The cinematography is great and doesn't feel like a typical Hollywood film. the only complain i had that is kinda predictable at points but that's not the problem of the film that's me watching too much films.This is a great drama with a excellent cast. i really recommend this film. even you're not going to like it, just see it. But you probably won't be disappointed.",The Place Beyond the Pines
423,simonwalker-963-271795,An amazingly beautiful story,10,3 April 2014,"This movie isn't like any other. There is no possible movie you could compare this with. Ryan gosling (Luke) plays a man who is meant to be depicted as someone who has made a lot of mistakes, but whats to do good. out of no where he finds out he has a child and this is when things get interesting. He tries everything he can to help his boy not make the same mistakes he did and its quite beautiful. Right before Luke gets shot and killed he says on the phone ""dont tell him who i was"" because he doesn't want his child being embarrassed of his dad and this touched me. Many parts in this movie actually touched me, for example when The magnificent shot from behind of Luke riding his bike down the road with the tree line, then in 15 years later his son riding down the same road carrying on his fathers legacy with the beautiful music. This movies soundtrack is brilliant, in fact one of a kind, the song that brings tears, right to Bruce Springsteens - dancing in the dark. People who say this movie starts great but looses pace are DEAD WRONG! If you watch from the first part right to the end all of the end makes sense and is just as touching. I cant think of that many things that where wrong with this movie, except maybe the fact that the drug factor shouldn't have been in there, i mean the story could have still be just as great with out the drugs but other than that this movie is amazingly well done. A must watch for movie lovers. Its just a beautiful movie.",The Place Beyond the Pines
424,jonathan-kronheimer,I highly recommend this film to anyone with patience.,10,10 August 2018,"To begin: this is not a happy film, nor is it conventional. People tend not to like that, and that's totally understandable. For me, that combination of unpredictability (I hadn't even seen a trailer of this movie before watching it; I had no idea what it was about) and raw, powerful feeling led to what I can only describe as a once-in-a-lifetime movie experience. I've seen a fair few movies, and this is the only one that has made me shed a tear (I was bawling). It's a total roller coaster emotionally. It has some of the happiest moments I've ever seen in a film (Luke feeding his son Ice cream) and some of the saddest moments (Jason taking the photo out of Avery's wallet, Jason driving off on the motorcycle). It has some of the tensest moments (Avery following Deluca into the forest), and it has some moments that are simply too spellbindingly beautiful to put any one label on, and here I'm thinking of Jason putting on his father's sunglasses before biking down the same roads his father biked down, with the soundtrack bringing the entire sequence together. Wonderful film making. On a technical level, this film is a masterpiece. The acting is spot on from everyone, the cinematography has been already been praised enough so I'll say no more here, and the sound design and music are great. The thing that makes this film so triumphant, though, is the script, namely the dialogue. The dialogue is very honest to how people actually talk. It's not lyrical or with any sort of rhythm or pacing like the way Tarantino writes. It's slightly clunky and lopsided, and this is not because the writer is bad, in fact it's just the opposite. Cianfance has captured something totally human in his dialogue, and this is a great achievement that I think deserves more attention.This is my favorite film and I highly recommend this film to anyone with patience.",The Place Beyond the Pines
425,iheartchoos,"Brilliant thought provoking film, but marketed incorrectly.",9,8 January 2017,"I've wanted to watch this film for a while and was looking forward to it. I wasn't disappointed, but it wasn't what I was expecting. We're told it's a crime thriller, and I think this is where some of the bad reviews are coming from. A crime thriller is usually racy and full of suspense. This film isn't. It's a slow paced, thought-provoking film about fatherhood, relationships, fate and life itself. It's split in to three separate stories that all link together. I love the way it's filmed and the characters created. I also found it had a subtle, dry humour in it. It's not a crime thriller, but I wouldn't know how to categorise it either.It left me thinking and affected me in some way, so it's not something to just watch for a thrill, but rather something to mull over afterwards.Worth a watch, but don't expect an edge- of-your-seat crime thriller that leaves you guessing until the end.",The Place Beyond the Pines
426,hudddwill,"Beautiful, tragic, haunting",10,1 June 2019,"I went in to this movie with only the basic plot in hand and wow it is so much more. Like other people said it is divided into three parts.
The first part of the movie was enjoyed by many but without the other two it is just an amazing crime movie. Do not get me wrong the first act is amazing with some of Gosling's best acting but the latter two make this movie a masterpiece.
In the second act we learn how Avery is struggling with his rushed fatal shot of Ryan Gosling. He is emotionally distraught and treats his child differently because of the guilt inside. He cannot comprehend that Luke's child will be living without his father.
The third act shows the two sons meeting and they are both in troubled places. It almost seems as if Avery's guilt for Luke made him abandon the duty of father. In the third act Avery is confronted with Jason and when Avery breaks down apologizing, Jason is removed of animosity and resentment towards his father's death. Also Avery's guilt is lifted when Jason decides not to kill him. Finally, with Avery's new ability to give attention to his son, AJ sees his dad with a new light and is able to clap for him with genuine love.
Overall all these themes are heightened with great supporting acting from Ben Mendelsohn, Mahershala Ali and Ray Liotta, through Cianfrance's choice of a beautiful score that still stays with me today, and some of the best naturallistic cinematography I have seen in a while.",The Place Beyond the Pines
427,hakura0,Beyond the... Misogyny?,1,28 April 2013,"So we went to see Beyond the Pines, expecting a mediocre-to-okay action flick with some decent drama and Eva Mendes, which is what we were promised by IMDb, which gave the film a respectable 7.8 out of 10 stars.What we got was a misogynistic, racist mess that we walked out of roughly half an hour before the end because we just. couldn't. take it. anymore.Basically -- since my actual review is apparently too salacious for IMDb -- what happens is that this dude has a casual fling with a woman, woman gets pregnant and has the baby, and he decides it's his right as ""father"" to invade every aspect of her life, up to and including unannounced barging into her home and basically taking over and being an enormous, abusive creep. He physically assaults her actual boyfriend, harasses and stalks her, and is basically the biggest jerk you could possibly imagine (he's a lot more than a jerk, actually, but that's the best I can do with IMDb's censoring). The fact that he was supposed to be a ""hero"" in this story actually makes me feel physically ill. He spends his portion of the movie stalking, harassing and emotionally abusing a woman -- what a role model.(Insert something here about the alleged ""plot"" in that portion of the movie, which involves the dude quitting his mobile job and setting up shop in town robbing banks so he can get more excuses and opportunities to stalk and harass Eva Mendes's character under the guise of ""being there for his son"" whom he virtually never interacts with except for in one montage.)The second third of the movie concerns a ~hero cop~ who is also a misogynistic jerk, who repeatedly tells his wife to ""shut up"" and ""stop talking"" because she dares to be concerned for him. He's basically also a huge jerk. His portion of the plot is concerned with police corruption and some other stuff that has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. (This is the part of the movie where a lot of really racist stuff happens. Like the cops giving ""points"" to a cop who kills a criminal, and extra points if they're white - because the police's history of shooting and killing people of color is just so funny.) The ""hero cop"" also harasses and stalks Eva Mendes's character, who actually spends about 90% of her time in this movie, if not more, being harassed and stalked by large, physically intimidating white men.The last third is well. Boring as heck and really disjointed from the rest of the story? Like, I don't even know. To be perfectly honest, we walked out around the two hour mark because we just couldn't take this crap anymore.I don't understand how this is getting good ratings, because it's absolutely the worst movie I've seen in years.",The Place Beyond the Pines

435,NicholasGFerguson,Truly an experience of a lifetime.,10,20 April 2013,"Warning; this review is full of spoilers!Going into the movie, you might think Luke Glanton is going to be the main focus, but you're about to enter into a journey of a lifetime, with the most complex and connected story line in recent memory.We find Luke(Ryan Gosling) in his every day routine, riding a motorcycle for a living in a carnival. After doing his job on this particular day, he finds Romina(Eva Mendes), his lover that we soon find he left after becoming the father of her child. He didn't know this though, mind you, he finds out by his mother when he comes to her door looking for her. He was going to leave town, but knowing he had a son, he decides to stay and try to take care of him.He finds out that Romina loves another man but he still wants her love, and his child. He quit his job, and needs another, and he just so happens to find Robin(Ben Mendelsohn) in the woods. Robin gives him a job in the garage, and gives him a place to stay. Luke needs more money than what Robin is giving him, but Robin doesn't have the money to give. He suggests, though, that he should try robbing a bank, as he had done it himself a couple of times. Luke hates the idea at first, but comes around to liking it.After the first time, he comes out clean, but he is repulsed by himself after what he just did. He realizes that it does help with money though, and he decides to do it again, with him feeling better about it. After a while of this(and Luke going to jail for other reasons), Robin has enough, and doesn't want Luke pulling anything himself, so he cuts up the bike he was using. Luke surprises him by waking him at gunpoint, and gets money for a new bike. He pulls another robbery, but this time not- so-successfully. The cops catch up to him, and he leads them on a chase, until he is blocked and he decides to run into a house. He makes a final call to Romina telling her he's in trouble and not to tell his son anything. The cop who followed him into the house, Avery(Bradley Cooper), shoots him, and he falls out the window to his death just before shooting Avery.Avery is praised for his bravery and heroism. He is feeling some guilt though. He knows Luke had a son his age, and he took his father away from him. Avery also shot first, even though Luke didn't draw yet. He still goes on with his life, though, and some other cops are trying to give him what they think he deserves. One cop in particular, Deluca(Ray Liotta), leads all of them in illegally seizing and keeping money as ""evidence."" They give a big share to Avery to reward him. Avery seems to have never realized how corrupt they were. One of the cops also tries to persuade Avery into getting him some drugs that are stored with evidence. Avery takes the stolen money to the head of his division after being denied a higher status. He accuses him of trying to rat out the other cops, and we see him tell Deluca about the incident. Avery is really angry after this. How could these cops all be so corrupt?Deluca tells Avery they need to talk about the money. He takes him out to the forest, much like having a chat in the desert of Las Vegas. All secluded, we see Avery pull out his gun and cocking it just to get ready for what may happen next, but he pulls out and speeds away as soon as Deluca steps out of his car. He tells his father the predicament he is in, and he gives him the idea to record the cop who wanted him to steal the drugs for him. He does so, and he uses that as evidence to take them all out of the picture. This also gives him an even better name and he advances in his position.Fifteen years later, we find both Avery and Romina's sons forming a friendship. They both relate in the use of drugs, and both end up getting caught because of this. Avery tells his son not to get involved with the other kid anymore, but he does anyway. While this goes on, Romina's son starts researching more about his father, Luke, and also finds out by an intricate turn of events that his ""friend's"" dad had killed his father. Avery's son gets a gun and breaks into Avery's house and gives his son a scare and a need of medical attention, to put it into words. Avery comes home, and he holds him at gunpoint and takes him out to the forest, and nearly kills him, but holds himself from it when Avery says he's sorry about killing his father. We find that everything seems to end fairly well for the Avery family, and Romina's son seems to follow Luke's path.I give The Place Beyond the Pines ten stars because it is so full of story, and original story at that. There is so much connection between everyone and it is told with such a beautiful storyline which has to be seen for yourself. Do yourself a favor and don't miss this movie. I can't think of anything wrong with it, and I could go on and on about what I like about it, so I won't. I'll just tell you it's amazing, and you need to experience it. I am looking forward to more movies by Derek Cianfrance, and I will have to watch some he has already made. Movies like this are the reason I still love movies. Most movies today are garbage, but ones like these stand in these tough times.",The Place Beyond the Pines

438,cillianmacg,Derek Cianfrance - Auteur Director,8,4 August 2013,"Derek Cianfrance's latest film is an investigation into masculinity, family, trauma, and the sins of the father being reflected in the actions of the son. While the film may be overlong and at times contrived, one thing that emerges from this film above all else is that Cianfrance is fast becoming a quality auteur director who may one day be regarded in the canon of deeply meditative filmmakers with Terrence Malick.Gosling as the stripped-down stunt man plays the bank-robbing motorcyclist outlaw Luke Ganton who grows from the childish Driver of Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive into a father with an almost sympathetic tunnel vision to provide for his child. The scenes with Gosling are expertly shot and provide us with the most realised insight into another of the mysterious characters that Gosling has been portraying recently. The opening scene in which Gosling walks through the carnival to the death cage where he will perform in an enclosed space for the public is a particularly brooding shot by the accomplished cinematographer Sean Bobbitt (who was responsible for some excellent scenes in Shame). We see his grimy tattooed back walk through the sticky lights of the rural carnival attractions. Incidentally, Gosling's back is proving to be a convincing place to tell a character's story, à la Drive.Gosling isn't the only attraction of this meditation though, quite sooner than expected we peek inside Bradley Cooper's narrative and see events from his perspective. This switch is handled with shocking ease by Cianfrance who weaves the stories of two families and two generations together and shows us the sins of the masculine father from two perspectives. Cooper's performance is the standout spectacle of the film as he battles internally with seemingly immovable forces in the film. Cianfrance's statement about the nature of masculinity in the American family is fascinating to watch but for the contrived ending.Cianfrance's film is at times Malickian, in that the director's central premise can be seen throughout the narrative. The film falls down in places but with time Derek Cianfrance will emerge as an auteur talent. Go see it. Ride the Lightning.",The Place Beyond the Pines

446,hpanditi,Cianfrance returns to truly impress with an unexpected tale of fatherhood,8,12 May 2013,"The Place Beyond the Pines: A Review DISCLAIMER: SPOILERS ""If you ride like lightning, you're gonna clash like thunder."" The Place Beyond the Pines (2012) Cast: Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes, Bradley Cooper, Emory Cohen, Dane DeHaan Director: Derek Cianfrance Brief overview: In this film, The Place Beyond the Pines, the actions of Luke Glanton (Gosling) spiral into a riveting tale. Starting out as a lowly motorcyclist at a circus, Luke Glanton decides to rob a few banks to provide for Romina (Mendes) and his unexpected baby son. As the story goes on, a rookie police officer with great aspirations clashes with Glanton, leading him to deal with his new heroism and corrupt department, not to mention his baby son.Review: In The Place Beyond the Pines, director Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine) returns with another tale about the harsh ruggedness of life combined with a tale about the meaning of fatherhood.This movie, split up into mainly three parts, begins with the story of Luke Glanton. We first see Glanton maneuvering his switchblade almost professionally and with tattoos scattered across his body. We follow behind him as he enters a sphere with two other motorcyclists, creating a performance as surreal as the movie's setting. As we meet Romina and their baby son, one slightly loses the hardness of Glanton and focuses more on the undeniably intricate relationship between father and son. We're puzzled, cheer for, and scold Glanton as he hastily robs banks in order to provide for his son. Similar to Gosling's character in Blue Valentine, Cianfrance once again brings out the brutality of a male figure but whose efforts are to care for his infant child. Cianfrance especially accentuates the pain felt by Glanton during his son's baptism by showing Glanton's presence and tears at his son's baptism. I'm no Christian but the Priest's words on Christ and enlightenment resonated and Glanton's pains were understood.In the second part of the film, officer Avery's (Cooper) adrenaline rushed chase is seen as a newly officer, clearly scared out of his wits, attempts to track down a robber. We see by his nervousness in which he shot Glanton that he is an innocent yet striving man doing his job with all his ability. We see his delicate nature as he argues with a blend of anger and politeness to his wife, his humbleness when he receives praises of being a hero, and his shock and disbelief as he is exposed to the corrupt nature of the other officers. One scene that is striking is the somber and exhausted look he gives to his son while he is sitting down in a couch with one elbow supporting his head. Here we see that his shooting of Glanton is tearing down his core but how he must not express this outward, especially to the other officers. However, his character rapidly changes to the opposite as his aspirations to become district attorney come into play. We see in his bribe to become the DA that he does have a bit of ruthless attitude inside of him. His morals and innocence falter as a rigid man takes his place. Bradley Cooper delivers this role excellently because he has the delicate nature of a good-hearted police officer and becomes an unyielding father that disciplines his son.In the third part of the film, the relationship between AJ (Cohen), and Jason (DeHaan), intertwine in the final part of the film. Their friendship at the high school, drug use, getting arrested, and their share of injuries primarily reinforce that their bond is a direct result of Glanton and Avery. In the teenage Jason, we see his desire to know about his roots primarily by learning about his father. His dark nature reflects that of his father but he shows a compassionate side of him as well. This can be seen in the final scene of the movie as he rides off in a brand new motorcycle.The setting of the movie serves to portray the image of a gloomy town that is embraced with mystifying pines. This scenery plays an important part in the movie because it represents the characteristics of the main characters, that of nature. Nature can be malicious to its dwellers yet strive to provide for those inhabiting it. Similarly, Glanton and Avery are both malevolent fathers but do what they do because they want to provide for their legacies, their sons. The soundtrack sometimes includes daunting piano to accentuate the awe and depth of this nature but it also includes moments of angelic singing, accentuating the gratifying moments of the movie.

We capture both the intense scenes of robbery, the high speed of the motorcycle, or even the riding of a bike on the road surrounded by the magnificent, quiet, and intimidating essence of the pines.",The Place Beyond the Pines
447,aiskrim,Film could have been better not done chronologically,6,8 August 2021,"Basically, I think the film should have focused on Jason and then jumps back and forth in time to when the previous generation's actions in the past affected his present life. But this might relinquish the big name stars to supporting roles, which might not be what the director had in mind for the film's concept. It's a drama, and I have enjoyed past dramas that were done non-chronologically.Also, I came to watch this film because of the excerpts in a Jake Tran YouTube video.",The Place Beyond the Pines
448,goehletaylor,A Gripping Story of Fathers and Sons,10,15 April 2013,"I walked out of this movie incredibly pleased. Much like Blue Valentine was a story about the evolution of a relationship between a husband and a wife, this is about the evolution of relationships between sons and fathers. The film constantly has you switching your stance on who you believe to be the protagonist and who you sympathize with. It is not a traditional movie by any standards and I think that it benefits from that. While the story is somewhat simple and easy to follow the twists are interesting and unexpected.The acting is the glue that holds this movie together. Gosling plays his role perfectly and you really feel the sense of desperation he is going through in trying to grasp to his newborn son and provide for his new family. Cooper is chilling. There are a couple scenes where it shows his face and you can tell exactly the sort of things that are going through his mind without him having to say a single word. Having scenes like this may be uncomfortable and foreign to the average moviegoer but it allows for you to feel the same emotions that the character is feeling which is something really unique and powerful.When the constant throughout the film is something as relatable as a relationship between a father and a son or a father and another father having the audience feel those emotions is a really chilling experience. There's a lot that I am intentionally leaving out because I believe that experiencing the incredible camera work, one really long and incredible action sequence, and tons of really fresh plot developments is something that should be left to be a surprise.I want to comment on a criticism that I have seen this film getting in many reviews that it is cliché. I have to really disagree. There are a lot of ways the story could have went that would have made sense and that I expected it to go but it didn't. Skip the next paragraph if you're sensitive to spoilers.When Cooper's wife sees him hiding the money that was taken from Ro's home you would think that it would lead to a development where his wife outs him or confronts him but she doesn't. This anti-cliché when wives of police-officers are always depicted as complaining and ruining whatever plot development is occurring but that does not happen. When Gosling goes to rob the bank for the final time and forgets his mask you think that he is going to be identified by his face tattoo after being recently put in jail and surely noted of his tattoos. But this doesn't happen. In fact the whole subsequent scene is extremely anti-cliché. The scene where he seemingly runs into a wall on his motorcycle but then ends up being able to get back on his bike and maneuver around it strikes me as being incredibly surprising and unpredictable. Ending in of course the ultra culmination of clichés with killing the main character less than halfway through the movie. The movie was not cliché and I can't really understand anyone who would say that.Long story short; the move struck a chord with me and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I saw it last night. One of my favorite movies in years, and apart from one not so stellar performance that if you saw the movie I'm sure you would know what I am referring to, it was absolutely perfect. Definitely watch this.",The Place Beyond the Pines

450,js-dykstra,Over most heads..,7,3 August 2014,"I haven't written a review before, but I felt inclined after reading a few on here because I feel like there are some interesting points and reoccurring themes portrayed in this movie that just seem to pass over too many heads. For people who value justice, this film will be a heartache. For those that value action and don't like to think too much, this film will be a headache.This film can be deeply thought provoking to certain people, and completely passé to others because they see this film through nothing but the lens of filmmakers and the performance of actors. The sequence of stories has, to me, a very obvious reoccurring theme, which depicts each character getting too deeply involved in their dark secrets. The young mother gets too deeply involved with her baby's father when she has found a new man. She ends up cheating on her new man with the baby's father, allowing him to get involved in her life, and ends up with a stressful maniac ex bashing her new guy's head in, and (maybe) the guilt of having cheated on her new man with the ex that just bashed his head in (at least I hope so, dang.) The motorcyclist, with good intentions for his son and dreams of being with his son's mother again, gets too deeply involved with the wrong guy robbing banks, and ends up dead. The cop that shoots him lies about the scenario, and his guilt makes him paranoid and erratic. His lies continue, and the more experienced corrupt cops lead him into scenarios that get him tied too deeply into corruption, and when he has a shot at making things right, suddenly he just uses it to his advantage. You can see his character change over the course of the film. He becomes a politician and gets too deeply involved to care about his kid, and his kid gets too deeply involved in a bad lifestyle and ends up getting arrested with the motorcyclist's kid (yeah, they meet later on), and the motorcyclist's kid gets too deeply involved with his douchebag 'friend' - the ex-cop/politician's son. The story makes you think about human nature: how we have good intentions, but wind up making selfish decisions to save ourselves, get too deeply into our evil ways, are offered redemption, and then selfishly use that chance to get back into our crap even further.",The Place Beyond the Pines

I even had every intention of seeing it in theaters, however, the movie marketed to you in the trailers is a very different movie than what you will see in the finished film. That's not always a bad thing but in this case I wasn't sure what I was watching for more than half the movie. It starts off with a couple of very interesting characters and, in fact, introduces many more over the course of the movie, however you quickly realize that many of the characters whose relationships are just starting to unfold become less than important. At a certain point the focus shifts to a new character just introduced and proceeds to follow him until the movie transitions to 15 years later. At this point we finally see what the movie is really attempting to get at, however it never really feels like it gets there.There could be a really interesting message or statement or lesson behind everything that happens in this movie, but there isn't. It simply ends leaving you feeling like nobody was the bad guy, nobody is the hero, and that we are all somehow responsible for the decisions of those who came before us.",The Place Beyond the Pines
454,stinad316,"""Fathers and Sons"" My review of the film The Place Beyond the Pines",4,22 April 2013,"In an ambitious attempt of an epic familial drama-tragedy, Pines is presented in three acts that span over 15 years. A single event is meant to tie many characters and story lines together, while consistently presenting father-son relationships (and their lack there of). Act one introduces us to Handsome Luke (Gosling) a stunt motorbike rider in a traveling carnival. Quiet, tough, covered in tattoos, he is bored, but complacent. When he is reunited with an old fling, (Mendes) he learns he has an infant son. At this point, Luke makes some big changes in his lifestyle. Act one is the most rich in story, action and character. The ultimate challenge for Luke will be deciding what kind of father he's going to be, and that effort alone, good and bad, makes for a believable struggle. In act one we also have Robin (Mendlesohn) the mechanic, who is another quiet, complex character, driving much of the action and simultaneously trying to slow Luke down. The chase scenes feel raw and gritty, which makes them tense and right at home here. Act one, running just under an hour is a complete character arc in a well-told story and could have stood alone. Act two slows down as it introduces Avery Cross (Cooper) a rookie cop, newly claimed as a hero. His father-son issues are immediately presented as influencing his decision making. He has an infant son whom he struggles to connect with, while simultaneously trying to get free of his own father's controlling hand. The story in act two is not nearly as compelling. Avery is troubled and dealing with dirty cops and guilt from his title of ""hero"". He is a coward and uses the difficult situations he is dealing with to leverage him upwards in his career. There is little to no action or excitement in act two, it's mostly a cop drama which echoes many dirty cop dramas before it. Ray Liotta is wasted as the obvious ringleader of unsavory behavior. If we are supposed to compare the men from act one and two I would say they both made bad decisions, however, Luke's struggle was how to become the kind father he wanted to be, and Avery's is how to be the kind of man his father wants as a son. Other than the single event that links the two men together, act two is a totally separate film. 15 years pass and the third act begins with Avery's father's funeral. And in the longest half hour of my life we watch Avery's son AJ and Luke's son Jason collide towards each other like bulldozers. There is no mystery in this setup and no fireworks upon impact, save for a black eye. The parallels in their two very different lives are annoying. Both generally fatherless, recreational drug users and outsiders. Jason's journey is to find out more about his biological father. He uses Google to learn AJ's father was involved and Mendlesohn's character Robin returns to be a helpful friend from the past. AJ seems to have no journey or goals at all. My personal issues with act three are unavoidable. 1. Although we see these two characters heading straight for each other, nothing is interesting. Now we're watching an angsty teen drama without bullies or any girls. 2. They've clearly used makeup to age Mendes 15 years forward, and although it's shocking I allow myself to believe a mother working hard in a sort of broken life would look older. Cooper and Mendlesohn are not aged at all. 3. The ending of this confrontation is so anticlimactic, there is no character development in the third act at all, it feels like the movie ends with the last little bit of air going out of a balloon. My issues with the film as a whole: 1. The place beyond the pines is the Mohawk name for Schenectady, NY where this movie takes place, but there is no place beyond the pines. It is not mentioned or even eluded to at all. 2. The female roles in the film are seriously lacking. Understanding the film is trying to deal more with father-son relationships, Mendes' character felt the most real, although she is relatively weak (both emotionally and in moral character). She spends most of her scenes in tears. Rose Byrne is also totally wasted as Avery's wife. She has two scenes and in both she comes off as bossy and powerless simultaneously. Neither gives off the impression they are warm, loving mothers which may add greatly to the unhappiness of our two teenage sons, but it's clearly not the focus of the film, and so, as mothers, they are simply outlines. 3. The three acts are so different it could be like watching 3 episodes of a TV show filmed ten years apart. They vaguely resemble each other. I give this film 4/10 all points awarded to the first act.",The Place Beyond the Pines
455,Cactus_Moonlight,Strongly acted; lousy narrative,6,19 April 2013,"SPOILERS! SPOILERS! SPOILERS! There, now I don't want anyone bitching about there being spoilers in this review. If you haven't watched The Place Beyond the Pines yet and you'd like to be saved from all the twists and turns in the narrative, skip this immediately. I walked into this film having watched half of a trailer and without reading any sort of review--I knew only who was starring in the film and that the director also made Blue Valentine a couple years ago. In fact, for the purpose of writing this, I went ahead and watched the full-length trailer with fresh eyes. It's not exactly misleading--the in-text could be summarized as ""Everything that happens to you could be altered by one event""--but the scenes are assembled to appear as though The Place Beyond the Pines is something like No Country for Old Men, with the cop (Bradley Cooper) chasing after the guy with a bunch of money (Ryan Gosling). In this narrative, though, there isn't an Anton Chigurh character so much as Luke, Gosling's character, is a down and out carnival worker who is willing to give up the life of motorcycle stunts when he learns that the woman he hooked up with a long time ago (Eva Mendes) gave birth to his son. Luke decides robbing banks is a logical way to get his hands on a sack full of money to support his infant son, so going by the trailer you would imagine Avery, Cooper's character, spends the duration of the film trying to track down Luke and bring him to justice. That's not how the film plays off at all. The Place Beyond the Pines could be analyzed as a three act play: the first involving Luke robbing banks to support Romina (Mendes) and her baby, the second involving Avery's inner struggle following the aftermath of a shootout with Luke and a corrupt police force, and the final being set 15 years later with Luke's son and Avery's son meeting in high school and becoming BFF's...up until Luke's son realizes what we knew for an hour now: Avery shot and killed Luke. Having refused to read any prior plot summary of the film, it was quite a shock to see Ryan Gosling killed off within the first hour. I was impressed with the director's choice here, and a little relieved; though Gosling is very solid here, with the handmade tattoos and the bleached hair and the inside-out T-shirts, I got tired of Luke fast. Perhaps Derek Cianfrance should have chosen an actor that he hasn't worked with that could convey that sort of character without remnants of The Mickey Mouse Club and The Notebook. Gosling is good at conveying a character who desperately wants to change his life, but something about his appearance is off. Maybe if the film allowed for some more character development, I wouldn't have this somewhat petty gripe. As it stands, The Place Beyond the Pines is a film nearly two and a half hours long, running at break-neck speed. A well-plotted story? Ain't nobody got time for that! What we get instead is Cianfrance putting all these plot threads on sticky notes (""Surprise, you're a daddy!"" ""Did I really shoot the bank robber first, or did he shoot at me first?"" ""We've got Ray Liotta for a couple weeks, so let's throw in a corrupt police force subplot!"" ""Hey, didn't your dad kill my dad over 15 years ago? That's really not cool."" ""Your dad was a really cool guy--here are his old sunglasses!"" ""I'm going to win this District Attorney election by any means necessary!""), and instead of choosing one or two subplots to work with, everything is put together like a poorly constructed quilt. Which isn't to say that the quilt doesn't serve its purpose in keeping us warm: the film is full of good to great performances, from Eva Mendes (who proves to me for the first time that she has more to offer to the world than a dinnerware set sold at Macy's), to Dane DeHaan (the offspring of Luke and Romina at age 17), and to the best of the lot, Bradley Cooper. I just wish the actors were given better material so I didn't have to sit back and play ""Guess where this plot contrivance goes,"" a game I handily mastered in the theater.

458,zacmazs,A big disappointment,3,7 May 2013,"After watching the trailers for this film I was super-excited to see it. The cast is brilliant, the director is brilliant, but unfortunately the storyline was poorer than I could even imagine. At first, I thought we'd see an interesting story about a carny' turned bank robber but Ryan Gosling dies about half-way through without making any sort of impact on the viewers or even the story-line as a whole.Secondly Bradly Cooper is introduced and remains the protagonist for the remainder of the film but, similarly to Gosling, doesn't earn the viewers sympathy or even attention as we see a stereotypical 'cop catching bad guy' routine. Finally we see the paths of both Gosling and Coopers sons cross to finish the film on a poor low. The only non-cliché'd surprise is that in the end *Spoiler* one son didn't actually kill the other as we were led to believe. I literally cared so much towards the end that I can't even remember who's son done what. Had I not been on a date, I would have left roughly about an hour and a half in. Overall a disappointing film that had all the makings of a masterpiece but falls, incredulously, short. I wouldn't recommend watching this film.

I enjoyed each section of the movie almost equally, but the first hour of the movie is definitely the strongest. The movie may be slow to some, but I was invested in the story from start to finish. This is the best I've seen Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper, no doubt. There are no bad performances but Cooper and Gosling's stand out the most.

I was hoping Kurt would kill Vinny, kill his father, burn down the house, blow up the neighborhood, and deliver the coup d' grace to himself.

The first story of Ryan gosling as the bank robber was excellent.(the first 45 minutes) the second story of Bradley Cooper exposing corruption within his police department was decent, the idea certainly had potential. And the last story of their two kids meeting had little potential but still could have been an alright movie. When all three are combined, it is nothing but irrelevant wasted potential. Ultimately this movie dies with Lives and Dies by Ryan Gosling. I walked out of the theater angry that i was so manipulated by a near perfect movie trailer. The idea of Ryan Gosling as a bank robber is now wasted and Bradley cooper as a good cop among bad cops is ruined.

Even though Ray Liotta's part in the movie was very short, it was also classic Liotta.The third scene was the most exciting for me how, even though coming from different backgrounds, both Avery and Luke's children were so much alike. One coming from a life of good but yet being pushed away as a child and another being alone and confused in a world where he wishes for answers that he has to find out for himself. In the end where Jason finds then sends the photo to his mother was very emotional being however much Jason's mother wanted to get away from the past it was all put in front of her with just a photograph.The ending was very well put together with Jason riding off on a speed machine, just like his father would of.Overall this movie, for me, was the best movie of 2013. 10 out of 10",The Place Beyond the Pines

He changes his mind and quits the tour to take care of his baby ""like a mawn"".The movie is full of clichés, I'm talking about '80 ""Americans vs. Evil Russians"" clichés.From the hot, blonde, rebellious biker who simply ""Doesn't care"" or ""Lives for the moment"" and wears Metallica t-shirt to the catholic Mexican girl who gets knocked up, not to mention the bank robing red necks ahh this movie will give you cancer.The target audience of this movie are dumb teenage girls who's vajayjay s tickle every time they see Gosling. If your intellectual level is above the one of a mongoloid then this movie is not for you. How the f*** did this get 7.8 rating on IMDb???",The Place Beyond the Pines
472,TheEcuadorian,A pretty looking/sounding convoluted mess...,5,26 March 2014,"I have to applaud ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" for its effort. This film has a fantastic premise and was certainly ambitious with its story. The risks it took and the tale it was attempting to tell are truly fantastic. Unfortunately for this film (and those watching), it never truly succeeds. This is due to some terrible pacing and badly written characters. It's hard to care about any of them, as none of the interesting ones are given enough time to become fully developed. Those who do get sufficient screen time, just aren't that attention grabbing, despite some descent acting. I would also just like to state that after watching this film, I wanted to strangle Emory Cohen. I'm sure he's a fine actor, but he plays probably one of the most aggravating/obnoxious/annoying characters I have seen in recent history. On the bright side, this film contains some great cinematography and a fantastic soundtrack. Seriously, instead of watching this boring and convoluted mess, get on Spotify right now and listen to the soundtrack, you'll have a better time.",The Place Beyond the Pines
473,dano743,A story that blurs the line of what's justified in life in the real world.,9,14 July 2013,"When I saw the trailer for ""The Place Beyond the Pines"", I thought ""Cool, I like dirt bikes and action, I'll have to watch that"" But something beyond the superficial caught my attention. There was heart here, and the most basic drive to do whatever one can for their family.""Handsome"" Luke, as played by Ryan Gosling, works as a motorcycle stunt rider. There are no stadiums, or big name sponsors. He seems destined to a mediocre existence. But you get the feeling he could be so much more, only he doesn't know any better. Then he finds a reason to become a better man. He discovers he has a son. The idea that he can have a family fills him with hope. You can see it in his eyes, and you feel his pain of loss from not knowing about him from the start. Not having the ability to deal with these emotions, Luke justifies turning to crime as a way to provide for his son. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" evoked different emotions for me. A sense of hope for Luke, that he just might be able to pull it together and make it work, which he so desperately needs. I felt that even though his actions were wrong, they were for the right reason in his mind, and that was enough for me to go along with it. Feelings too, of betrayal and loss for not being told about the son. Admiration for a man so loyal and driven to be there for his boy, and a sense of despair, thinking it won't work out in the end.Brilliant performances were given by Gosling, and Ben Mendelsohn as Robin. There is something very real about this film. The characters, the setting, and that basic human instinct that drives us to do what needs to be done.",The Place Beyond the Pines

In the beginning I thought it was going to be romantic, cause beautiful Eva appeared, but it is raw and real, very real! One of my favorite movies of this year, definitely.Ryan Goslings' character is dark and intriguing. Hes an ""outlaw"". His clothing, his manners and neurotic behaviour are so well thought through and eventually performed by Ryan. He is great at it. Bradley Cooper is a totally different actor. I was curious to see them performing together and what kind of movie it would turn out to be. I have a coupe of favorite actors I can always watch.

It continues by following Bradley Cooper through some challenges personally and professionally following his recognition for being shot in the line of duty when he killed Gosling. I really liked seeing Ray Liota I've always been a fan. Then it jumps 15 years forward. What?? Where are we now? I was really losing interest by now.

477,MagnNelsh,The Place Beyond the Pines,10,13 September 2015,"Watched this movie the other day and it was just amazing. The story and the story-telling; the movie really cares about its characters. The story is a kind of anthology design that is built around Ryan Gosling's character and how his life comes to affect the lives of others. The character itself I found to be one of the greatest written characters of the last twenty years: you really become attached to his story. The movie also focuses on following Bradley Cooper's character after an encounter with Gosling's character. I think he did amazing job capturing the guilt his character felt and you could sense how that guilt was present throughout the movie. Then there is Dane DeHaan's character, which was superbly executed in story and in performance. Strong support came from Eva Mendes and Ben Mendelsohn in supporting roles.Something in this film truly answers the reasons why I watch movies.

The story line is very good with a great twist at the end that everyone will love. Although this movie had a good story line, the reason I gave it an 8 out of 10 was for the way the movie is written. It has 3 main segments to it that has a new main character, but it all comes back around at the end. Most movies stay with the same main throughout the film, and the way this one takes on almost an entirely different movie between segments is fascinating and even though the movie is long and sometimes drawn out, it keeps your interests throughout. I strongly suggest watching this movie, you will not regret it. The creativity is superb.",The Place Beyond the Pines

There are no characters who are particularly likable (or unlikable) or that are even much deeper than a cardboard cutout. The story is slow, which actually make a little sense since it goes nowhere. Where's the conflict? Hmmmm, not that sure. Any redemption? Not too sure I'm seeing that, either. Any real point at all? No, not really. This is the kind of film that people pretend they like in order to appear sophisticated.

480,ajwigdahl24,Amazing first act but throws it all away...,5,24 March 2015,"The Place Beyond the Pines was unfortunately a massive disappointment for me. The first act of this film was absolutely brilliant, and Ryan Gosling could not have been better. His struggle of wanting to provide for his son but having to do so by robbing banks was so well done, it's a shame the movie threw that away. The first hour or so of this film was an adrenaline-pounding, crime thriller, and IT WAS PERFECT. But then, after the death of Ryan Gosling's character, the movie completely shifts it tone and story to Bradley Cooper's character, giving the viewer no time to adjust to the massive change in events. Suddenly, the plot changes from a riveting crime thriller to a slow, boring second act. The film completely abandons the plot that had worked so well, and now is focusing on the corruption of Cooper's police department... Why? Everything that worked so well for act one is tossed out the window as the plot, characters, tone, and excitement completely changes. Act three, however, was absolutely awful in my opinion. The film jumps immediately to 15 years later, and suddenly all of the plot points in act one and two are completely irrelevant with the only exception of Gosling's death. Cooper's son's character was horribly, horribly acted in the worst character of the whole movie. Suddenly, the plot shifts yet again to teenage smoking and parties... again, why? This film started out as a crime thriller and is now about two teens who skip math to go smoke weed. Ultimately, act one was magnificent, but the writers killed off the best part of their film: Ryan Gosling, way to soon in the story. The three acts of the film were so immensely disconnected that the plot points became entirely irrelevant. The end of the film was very unsatisfying for me as well. This movie had amazing potential with the first act, but unfortunately ruined it by killing off the best character, focusing on plot points that don't even matter, and three acts that seemed very disconnected. 5 out of 10 stars for me, but only because of Gosling's first act.",The Place Beyond the Pines

482,wrlight10,Great Movie,9,5 November 2014,This movie takes you on a ride not quite many others. The story starts off with a struggling motorcyclist (Ryan Gosling) who is trying to win the love and trust from his ex-girlfriend (Eva Mendes) and newborn son. Gosling finds himself going to extreme measures to do this when he meets a man that he would later devise a plan to rob banks with. After some success he is later caught as he tries to rob too many banks at once. The cop (Bradley Cooper) shoots and kills Gosling and an entire different storyline is presented. Cooper is faced with the tough situation of being portrayed as a hero and avoiding what dirty cops do with the money that was compromised from the robbery. The movie then progresses 15 years later and a successful Cooper is now faced with dealing with his rebellious son who later would become best friends with the son that Gossling had.,The Place Beyond the Pines
483,ryanmay0422355,This film is a masterpiece,9,4 January 2015,"There are few films that can grab me the way 'The place Beyond the pines' did, I believe the script is so well written that the characters do not feel to be just characters anymore, and I don't feel to be part of the audience. This film will grab you and take you on a roller coaster. It truly is a credit to Derek Cianfrance's ability to not just write, but to create. Credit is also due to the actors in this film for an excellent portrayal of what Cianfrance had envisioned. It is truly a bittersweet shame that this movie hasn't received the commercial success it deserves. I recommend this film to absolutely anyone who is interested in good cinema, particularly good acting and even more superb scripts.",The Place Beyond the Pines
484,mkbeirne,Intellectually Appealing,8,14 January 2015,"The movie, ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" circles around different kinds of crime and its consequences. The first part of the movie circles around the story of the main character, Luke Glanton, who is a carnival motorcycle bike rider. He is rough around the edges, grungy, and has a history of violence and crime. Luke ends up finding out that a girl he was seeing earlier, Romina, had a child with him but didn't tell him. When he finds out that the child is his he puts in a great effort to provide for his son and Romina. In that effort he teams up with a local guy named Robin who helps him become a bank robber. Again and again they rob different banks until Luke is put in jail for some time because of a violent incident with Romina's boyfriend. Luke loses control of himself under the stress of Romina having a boyfriend, his lack of presence in his son's life, and him robbing banks. Luke ends up trying to rob a bank alone which ends in a police chase and him losing his life by getting shot by the cop who chased him, Avery. Avery shot Luke first which he lied about in order to stay out of trouble. He becomes a local hero, gets mixed up with some of the corrupt cops in the station, struggles with the push and pull between right and wrong all while trying to do right by his wife and his one year old son. Avery, like Luke was, struggled. He got to a point where he was fearful of his life from the corrupt cops because he ratted them out, and he ended up pulling a move, that put them all in jail, secured his safety, and provided him a job in the DA's office. The third part of the movie which was based fifteen years after the incident circles around Avery's run for office. It also is a mixture of his son named AJ's life and the life of Luke's son, Jason. They run into each other, become friends, and get into trouble with the police for drugs. Going against his father's wishes, AJ still hangs out with Jason, but they have a fight which puts Jason in the hospital. Jason finds out from Romina's boyfriend who his father is and also finds out that AJ's dad was the one who killed him. Jason, angry and out of control goes to AJ's house beats him up, takes Avery at gun point to the woods in an attempt to avenge his father's death, but does not end up pulling the trigger after Avery breaks down and apologizes to Jason. At that point there is no more tension and the air becomes clean. Jason ends up running away on a motorcycle like his dad, and Avery wins office. There are a lot of oppositions in the movie. There is the comparison between Luke and Avery. Both are fathers with one year old sons. One is a criminal who is robbing to become a part of his son's life. Avery becomes corrupt and doesn't make enough effort to be a part of his son's life. Although Luke is the criminal, Avery becomes the criminal at one point. There is a scene in the movie where Avery finds Luke's backpack and puts it on. This symbolism shows that Avery has become the criminal. The sons are very different also, but there are some similarities. There is the scene where Jason and AJ fight and Jason is knocked out on the grass on his back with his face all bloody. This image is exactly the same image of Luke laying on his back after Avery had shot him. In the movie there are different angles of corruption. There is the life of Luke and his crime. Then there is the corruption of the police which is ironic because they are the ones who are supposed to keep crime at bay. The corruption of Avery is a process because at first he is naïve and innocent until he shoots Luke and things change. Avery's law background and his father being a judge would be the reason for Avery's internal struggle between right and wrong. In his speech he noted how law was all about justice, and how sometimes you didn't need to talk but instead act. This is why he enjoyed his police job, but it's ironic because Jason wants to act to create justice by killing Avery in the end. The cycle of crime, lies, and corruption comes from just that. It starts with one person and then goes to the next. It started with the fathers and then moved to their sons. The moment the cycle stopped was when Jason did not pull the trigger because of Avery's repentance to Jason. This is what saved him and the cycle. The movie was very good and intellectually appealing.",The Place Beyond the Pines
485,zacktidmore,A great movie that brings 3 stories together to make one impactful message,9,23 February 2015,"The complex character development and multiple stages of The Place Beyond the Pines gives the film an uncommon feel that most viewers are not accustomed to. Instead of becoming jumbled and confusing, the three parts are distinctly separate and provide a logical progression that makes the story easier to understand. This unusual format also allows for extended character development that would otherwise be impossible. The most unique aspect of the film's progression is the look into the lives of the two main character's sons. The actions of the fathers are magnified by looking at the results that they had on their sons. By looking at the two generations, the effects of relationships across time become obvious. The lack of development of female characters also emphasizes the relationship between father and son. By providing multiple levels of a story that spans several years and creating unparalleled character development, The Place Beyond the Pines achieves a level complexity and emotional depth that is missing in most films.In the first section of the story, the film's primary focus is to develop the character of Luke Glanton played by Ryan Gosling. When the viewer is first introduced to Luke at the circus where he rides motorcycles, his messy tattoos and faded clothes are immediately prevalent. The outlandish appearance of Gosling's character leaves no doubt that he has lead a troubled life to this point and has likely struggled to make ends meet as a member of a traveling circus. Given his already known outlaw nature, it comes as a surprise when he decides to quit the circus upon learning he has a one-year-old son, Jason. Even though the mother gave him every opportunity to leave town with no responsibility for the child, Luke decides to stay so he can give his on the father figure he never had himself. By turning to robbing banks to provide for his family, he shows that he will go to any lengths necessary to provide for his family. The film does an excellent job of not portraying these robberies as the work of a hardened criminal but a man who is just trying to make the most with what life has given him. Desperate to prove to the mother of his son that he is worthy of her love, these runs on banks become more and more reckless until his partner in crime has to step aside and say, ""If you ride like lightning you're going to crash like thunder"" (Cianfrance, The Place Beyond the Pines). This powerful line signals the beginning of the downfall of Luke. The cool, calm acting of Ryan Gosling brings out the best of Luke's character and makes him much more interesting and relatable. After he is eventually caught and gunned down by Avery Cross early in the film, the impact of his character is felt until the end of the story. The shooting changes the way Avery looks at everything in his life, and the loss of his father shapes the decisions that Jason makes as he grows older looking for answers.When Avery Cross is introduced just before the death of Luke, the story takes a dramatic turn and refocuses on the life of the young cop. In the heat of the moment, Avery makes the mistake of firing his gun before Luke and shoots first before the criminal had a chance to surrender. It becomes immediately evident that this costly error shakes Avery to the core, but he stands by his decision and lies to his superiors telling them that the thief fired first. From this point forward, Avery struggles to see right and wrong in terms of black and white. Because the son of the man he killed was the same age as his son, his guilt drove him away from AJ. Kevin McClure describes how confused the young police officer is in his review claiming, ""Though keenly aware of his own faults as a father and at one point openly discussing with a therapist his difficulty to look his son in the face, Avery knows he's not the father he could be"". Despite knowing he needs to give his son more attention, Avery fails to live up to his duties as a father. The intense emotional connection that the viewer has with the themes of family and fatherhood make Avery's internal struggle impossible to turn away from.In the third level of the film, when the movie fast-forwards fifteen years, Avery's personal life has begun to fall apart. Because of his lack of a fatherly instinct, he is divorced and his son has lost his way in drugs and other vices. Luke's son Jason is also going down the wrong path in his young adult life because of his missing father figure. By including this final section that many films would have left out, the director effectively continues the story in an innovative way, and ""Cianfrance nicely tie up his themes of fatherhood and sin at one time"" (Dianora). Finishing the film with a second shows how the effect of one mistake can reverberate for years and hurt more than just the person who is responsible.The multiple layers that are so effectively woven together set The Place Beyond the Pines apart from its competition and make it an exceptional piece of artistry. The tale progresses with each stage of the film by giving the viewer a different perspective of the killing of Luke Glanton and its lasting impact. By delivering all of these perspectives seamlessly the director ensures that the long film is intriguing until the final credits. The dynamics of the relationship have never been more evident in a film as the viewer gets a look at multiple families across fifteen years of life. The Place Beyond the Pines exemplifies the meaning of fatherhood, family, and responsibility.",The Place Beyond the Pines

Although the first two acts were done extraordinarily well, the last act lacked a lot. It honestly probably could've been cut from the film entirely, but that would've taken away from the larger scope to complete the storyline. But that didn't make me enjoy the film any less.

This was the start of something that seemed to be great, Ryan Gosling opens with, all be it low budget but what seemed to be a great story that was leading to a great end, then it actually seemed to end, I then found myself watching another film about Bradly Cooper, toiling to deal with the pain and suffering he'd caused now on Eva Mendes and Gosling's son. Cooper brings down a band of crooked cops to get somewhere he didn't want to be at the beginning of his section of the film but the middle of the actual film. Then it ends again?

But it wasn't to be, imdb had an average of 7/10 it's a 2 on a really good day when the tv is pants and it's the only thing to watch because the dvd is suck in the machine.

500,renu-09957,Movie so bad i finished it in two days.,1,27 May 2018,"This movie is so goddamn stupid and pointless. It scares me how bad it is, guys.
In the first scene of the movie, Romina scores a bike ride with Luke. For no apparent reason. It's like she is leading him on and when he asks her if they can get a drink or something, she says no. WHYYYY.
When Luke gets the crib, Kofi gets angry because it is his house. Wow, prince charming. You care more about your rundown house than a crib for an infant child who you call your son? Really smooth. And, when Romina coos ""Baby."" at Kofi after he is punched by Luke doesn't even add up. There is simply no chemistry between them. 
If the girl wants to have no ties with the father of their child, fine. But Luke was trying to do a really nice thing by getting presents for his child, there is no crime in that. And, a scene that depicts the opposite of that shows how talented the writers and directors are. 
I can't understand why Eva Mendes (the intelligent and beautiful actress that she is) would even choose to read a script in which she is merely a damsel in distress and where two men are just fighting over her and her baby.

Before attending the movie I read many friends reviews stating that it was ""aweful"" and now I couldn't disagree more.The character development and somber, but very realistic storyline of a rookie cop and his demons he now carries as a result of his duties - were wonderfully done. A reviewer on this site said that Avery's sons portrayal as ""ghetto"" was unrealistic. As someone who works for a police department - I see this a lot, so I disagree that it is an unreal scenario.Not quite what the trailer surmised the movie to be, but a great story none the less and would recommend it to anyone willing to sit and follow a story for it's content, not for it's flash.",The Place Beyond the Pines

Like I reckon many other people, I use this website to evaluate the potential of me liking a movie or not. As such, I have no idea how this one can have the high rating that it has as of today. I tried to like the movie, I really did try - only to end up being mad at how I wasted my time with something so utterly irrelevant I still can't believe it.The movie basically is split into 3 different stories, starting with a motocross biker (Gosling) who left his girlfriend only to find out later that he has a son with her. Since he is no part of their life anymore, he wishes to support him financially and starts robbing banks. Eventually the second part of the story takes over, which revolves around the cop (Cooper) who faces the gangster and from there on solely focuses on him and how he abuses the power of corruption evidence to push his own career. From there on, the sons of the both are the subject of the last part of the tale that find out about the entanglements in their fathers' past.I found the majority of the protagonists' behaviour incredibly irreproducible and implausible. Cooper gets hailed as a hero but obviously can't deal with his own guilt, but he has no balls to stand against what is thrown at him so it all just gets worse. Yet in the end he turns a cold-hearted career bitch out of a sudden which so collides with his previous behavior I have no words for it. Why that is never explained. This is only one example of the oh so many, I'm getting tired to even think about them.After a while, I just lost interest. I wanted to see how it ended, but I couldn't care less for any of the characters. I forced myself to sit through it all, but boy I wished I would have walked away. Everything about this movie made ma angry. The acting by the sons and Gosling's partner is so clichéd and over the top, it hurts. Did I mention they are constantly smoking just for the heck of it? Constantly doing drugs for absolutely no reason? Anyways, I cannot recommend this movie to anybody, not even hardcore Gosling or Cooper fans. It's utterly boring and meaningless BS. Please do not watch it.",The Place Beyond the Pines
503,rwilly1955,So disappointing,6,4 January 2014,"It's been a while since I felt the need to vent my frustration with movie but the time has come. Never has a movie that started out so well, ended so miserably. While basically a 3 act play, the brilliant first and second acts grabbed the viewer with its tight plot and brilliant acting. I actually turned to my girlfriend half way through the film and gave myself a pat on the back for choosing a film that pleased us both. Inexplicably the third act was a dragged out meandering mess. It's as if the director had no idea how to end it and just hoped that the pieces would somehow come together. They did not. After the 2 hour mark I just wanted the damn thing to end. The contrived third act and ending was laughable. It did not have to be this way. Shame on those responsible for destroying this movie's incredible potential.",The Place Beyond the Pines
504,hsdencker,I can't wrap my head around it,9,17 November 2018,"If I have to be honest here, I cried my eyes out like a baby during most of the film. For some reason, this drama just hit a very sensitive spot for me. - I am almost certain that it was Ryan Gosling's outstanding performance that hit me deep in my gamut of emotions, resulting in various intense feelings of compassion and sympathy that just seemed to keep appearing throughout the film - he represents such a heartwarming yet melancholic character who you can't help but to sympathize with. In the most beautifully portrayed way, we undergo af journey starting from Luke Glantons' (Ryan Gosling) unfortunate situation to smoothly transitioning into Avery Cross' (Bradley Cooper) life whilst issues such as fraud within police departments, abandonment, poverty and social heritage are illuminated in the thrill of it all - and the crazy mixture of different perspectives and issues all makes sense. More I can't say, or else I will reveal the whole plot. The only thing left to say is, if you don't know what you're going to expect from this movie, you're going in for a storytelling told untraditionally, composed perfectly ending with a somewhat circular structure. - Trust me, this only makes sense in the end.
To finish off with a sentence: This movie represents a classic example of your unethical actions coming back to taunt you.",The Place Beyond the Pines
