0,Leofwine_draca,Decent stab at a home invasion flick,8,11 December 2014,"YOU'RE NEXT is the latest in a long line of home invasion horror movies, following on from the likes of the LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT and MOTHER'S DAY remakes, along with the likes of THEM and THE STRANGERS. The good news is that this is one of the best instalments in the sub-genre, a tough and merciless thriller packed to the brim with danger and death.The plot is a cliché in itself: a family brings together its diverse offspring for a long-awaited get-together, but outside influences have other ideas. It starts off on a strong footing and gets stronger as it goes on, as the surviving family members must do battle with some sinister masked assailants. Like THE AGGRESSION SCALE before it, much of the running time involves one survivor who turns the tables on their attackers, much like a HOME ALONE for adults.I'm not kidding anyone by saying YOU'RE NEXT is perfect. The characters are thinly-drawn and difficult to care about, and there's at least one scene of exceptionally dodgy shaky-cam which threatens to ruin things. But it is a damned entertaining film, because it focuses on the act of fighting back rather than gruelling torture porn as in so many routine horrors (think TRAIN with Thora Birch for example). Sharni Vinson is a tough heroine to root for, and the film-makers don't hold back on their depictions of pain, injury and death. It's all done in the best macabre way, and it's great fun.",You're Next
1,SnoopyStyle,"Weak intro, but good twist",7,31 December 2013,"It's a family reunion for the Davison family. The father was in the marketing department for a huge defense contractor, and he's loaded. Erin (Sharni Vinson) is one of the son's new girlfriend. A gang of masked killers descend on the family, but Erin has a few surprises waiting for them.It takes a lot of time to get the movie going. Aside from the perfunctory killings, the first 25 minutes is dedicated to bringing a whole lot of these characters on screen a few at a time. I'm not particularly interested in any of them. And I couldn't really tell who's who in this family. When they finally get together at the diner table, I feel that's the real start of the movie. We finally get a nice feel of who some of these people are. Their interactions revealed more to me at the diner table than the previous 25 minutes. Then the action starts.The action is all crossbows, knives, and axes. It's a little weird. While I understand the reason, I think a more prominent explanation is needed. Then the movie gives us a twist. It's a very good twist. It could have been much better with a better intro to lay down the bread crumbs. Once again, the weak intro fails the movie.As for the actors, I found most of them to be overacting at first. It's not unusual in a horror movie. A lot of yelling and screaming can hide a lot of sins. It didn't help that so many of the characters seem to be doing stupid things. Sharni Vinson is a good solid lead. She looks like a weak girlie girl but is also believable as a bad ass. Nicholas Tucci plays a pretty good weasel. Overall, the acting is pretty good for a low budget horror.",You're Next
2,Prismark10,Home Invaders,6,8 November 2017,"You're Next is a rather intelligent horror thriller which at least gives some thought to the plot, the motivations of the villains and how the heroine at least manages to keep them at bay.Unfortunately it is let down with a rather slow opening and low budget as a lot of it is dimly lit. Still it is one of the better horror/thrillers of recent years.The Davison's are having a celebratory dinner in a remote vacation home. The parents are celebrating their anniversary and their children and significant others have joined them. Their is some bickering before they are attacked by crossbows by people on the outside wearing masks.In the confusion and among the mounting death toll, one of the girlfriend's invited turns out to be handy in defending herself.",You're Next

Their sons Crispian (AJ Bowen) comes with his girlfriend Erin (Sharni Vinson); Felix (Nicholas Tucci) with his girlfriend Zee (Wendy Glenn); Drake (Joe Swanberg) with his wife Kelly (Sarah Myers); and their daughter Aimee (Amy Seimetz) comes with her boyfriend Tariq (Ti West). When they are ready to have dinner, they are attacked by a stranger with a crossbow, and Drake is wounded by an arrow and Tariq dies. They discover that their cell phones are jammed and they are trapped in the house. Erin tries to protect the house, closing doors and windows, but the masked killers murder the members of the family. Are the killers lunatic? What is the motive for slaughtering the Davison family? ""You're Next"" is a brutal and gore slasher with good story and twists. The plot points are not so obvious and Sharni Vinson is the heroin that every viewer will cheer on. She seems to be a fragile woman but her reaction recalls the lead character in ""The Descent"". My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Você é o Próximo"" (""You're Next"")",You're Next
4,nogodnomasters,Getting beat up by a girl,8,20 February 2018,"The Davidson family gets together for mom and dad's 35th reunion. The kids and their bf/gfs are there for what starts out a bit snarky at dinner, then sudden arrows start coming through the windows killing people. The slasher aspect gets up close and personal, as we try to figure out the motive of the slashers (not too hard from the few clues) as there are no other characters introduced. The killers hadn't planned on plucky Erin (Sharni Vinson) fighting back.This is perhaps one of the better home break-in slasher movies I have seen in a while, which isn't saying much. A little horror, a little, drama, a little humor, a little mystery. Definitely worth a rental for fans of the genre.Parental Guide: F-bomb, nudity (Kate Lyn Sheil, Margaret Laney)",You're Next
5,kosmasp,"But who is ""you're""?",9,27 October 2013,"Apart from spotting Ti West (a director in his own right), the movie has a lot of things going for it. It's a action filled horror movie, that tries and succeeds in combining different elements from other movies. With a great female lead that is the definition of ""Kick-Ass""! She is so great you might just become a fan of her (even though you know she's able to hurt you pretty badly).The movie has some mystery surrounding it, but it doesn't matter if you figure it out, before it is revealed or not, the main thing to enjoy here, is the ride. And what a ride it is. There is a lot of violence in there (intense violence I'm sure some rating boards will attest). Hopefully you can enjoy this as much as we did at Frightfest in London! I have no idea why it took so long to release the movie (2 years), but seems like a trend with really good horror movies (see Cabin in the Woods).",You're Next
6,Sleepin_Dragon,I totally enjoyed this film,9,3 October 2015,"Over the last few years I think the slasher genre movie has died off a little bit they've stopped making unique and interesting movies, but this one was a little glimmer of light. A couple are murdered by someone disguised in a cat mask, later on their neighbours hold a large family gathering and the troubles begin. During a family meal the daughter's boyfriend catches sight of something happening outside and gets hit in the head by an arrow. The terror begins as one by one the family members begin getting picked off and a desperate battle for survival begins. 'We're all gonna die.' I've got to be honest I thought the scene of the boyfriend being shot down by an arrow was just brilliant, a real switch into scare and disbelief. There are some really grim bits, the wire line in particular, nasty. Suspense and surprises through to the very end, lots of violence, so if you are offended avoid. I thought it was a great film, lots of revenge, some great visual scenes, it managed to be different. 9/10",You're Next
7,gavin6942,Big Break For Adam Wingard,6,2 September 2014,"When the Davison family comes under attack during their wedding anniversary getaway, the gang of mysterious killers soon learns that one of victims harbors a secret talent for fighting back.Adam Wingard hit the horror world hard a few years ago with ""Pop Skull"" and followed that up with ""A Horrible Way to Die"". His artistry divided people, as he did not follow the standard rules of filming. Here he tries a more conventional approach, which hit home hard and brought him mainstream success. Coupled with his work on ""V/H/S"", he has pushed the ""Splat Pack"" crew to the side and ushered in mumblegore.This film is also helped by the star power of Barbara Crampton, and the indie star power of Larry Fessenden. The average viewer may not know or care who they are, but horror buffs are going to be thrilled to see some familiar faces.We also have the break through for Sharni Vinson, who had been around a while but was not particularly noticed. After this, she made the list of great actresses in horror and has been a big hit at conventions. To say her career has taken off between 2011 and 2014 might be a slight exaggeration, but this film certainly opened doors for her.Although popular with many horror fans and convention attendees, not all critics loved the movie. Simon Abrams called the film ""a simultaneously nihilistic and grossly incompetent horror homage... an assembly-line product made on a small production line, the film has a situation instead of a plot, and types instead of characters."" Too harsh? Perhaps. But one suspects that Abrams' mentor, Roger Ebert, would not have been much more praising.",You're Next
8,jboothmillard,You're Next,6,8 March 2017,"I remember seeing images of this scary movie a few times, specifically characters wearing animals masks, and obviously the title was intriguing, so I hoped it would be worthwhile, directed by Adam Wingard (Blair Witch). Basically the Davison family are having a reunion at their rural Missouri vacation home, Crispian Davison (AJ Bowen) is bringing his girlfriend Erin (Sharni Vinson) to meet his parents Aubrey (Barbara Crampton) and Paul (Rob Moran), his older brother Drake (Joe Swanberg), Drake's wife Kelly (Margaret Laney, or Sarah Myers), Drake's younger siblings Felix (Nicholas Tucci) and Aimee (Amy Seimetz), Felix's girlfriend Zee (Wendy Glenn), and Aimee's boyfriend Tariq (Ti West). During dinner, crossbows are shot through the window, Drake is wounded and Tariq is killed, the unknown attackers have jammed the cell phone signals. Aimee runs out the front door to get help, but has her throat slashed running into a garrote wire, she quickly dies of blood loss, Crispian leaves the house to find help. Paul takes Aubrey upstairs to the bedroom and leaves her, Fox Mask appears from under the bed and kills her, when the others find her dead, the words ""You're Next"" have scrawled with Aubrey's blood on the wall. Erin texts 911 and starts finding objects to be used as weapons, Tiger Mask is wounded attempting an attack on her, Kelly evades an attack from Fox Mask, still hiding under the bed, she panics and goes to the neighbour's house, but is shocked to find the couple next door have been murdered, then Kelly is killed by Lamb Mask. Tiger Mask fails to kill Erin, she kills him with a meat tenderiser, she then finds Lamb Mask trying to attack Drake, she stabs him with a screwdriver and he retreats. Paul finds, when exploring, evidence that the attackers have been staying in the house for some time, before he can tell Zee and Felix, Fox Mask kills him, but it is revealed Zee and Felix have hired the assassins to murder the family to get the inheritance. Drake is lured into the basement by Felix, who fatally stabs him, Erin is unaware of Felix and Zee's scheme, with Zee helping her set up traps, Erin explains she learned her combat and survival skills growing on a survivalist compound. Zee is interrupted before she can attempt to kill Erin, an argument is overheard between Felix, Zee, Fox Mask and Lamb Mask, Erin now realises their plans and escapes the house. Lamb Mask pursues her, but she kills him, but she realises she won't get far with her wounded leg, so she returns to the house and sets up a trap outside the front door, however Fox Mask enters through the window, so she ambushes and kills him in the basement. With all hired assassins dead, Felix and Zee try to kill Erin themselves, but she brutally kills them both, but it is not over, as Crispian inadvertently reveals his involvement in the scheme calling Zee's cellphone. When Crispian returns to the house, she ignores his attempts to bribe her with the money, she fatally stabs him, a policeman arrives at this moment and shoots Erin in the shoulder, after calling for backup he is accidentally killed by the trap Erin set up outside the front door, it is implied Erin is being questioned by the police to determine the events. This could have been just a run-of-the-mill deadly house siege movie, where one by one the victims are killed until one remains, but this one is different, because the masked maniacs hadn't counted on the house guest being intelligent in the ways of defence, Vinson is the perfect choice to the play the smarter than average girlfriend. It is a little droll at times, but the pace is fine, the gory moments certainly get your attention, the animal masks are creepy, giving the film a little slasher style, and the suspense works at the right moments, all in all it is an entertaining horror. Good!",You're Next
9,BA_Harrison,I'd pass if I were you.,3,25 August 2014,"Home invasion horror You're Next opens with a couple being murdered shortly after having sex, and proceeds to wheel out every other hoary old genre cliché that writer Simon Barrett and director Adam Wingard can think of. While Barrett and Wingard seemingly believe that, in deliberately including every slasher trope possible, they are being both clever and funny, the reality is that their film is simply boring and hugely predictable.Sharni Vinson plays Erin, a pretty degree student who accompanies her boyfriend to a family gathering at his parent's isolated home. During the evening meal, the family comes under attack from masked assailants wielding crossbows, and Erin is forced to use her survivalist skills to stay alive.Within ten minutes I had guessed that the attackers were in cahoots with a member or members of the family; within twenty, I had narrowed it down to two suspects and had correctly identified the motive. With a narrative that never surprises, characters that are difficult to care for, unexceptional gore, and attempts at dark humour that frequently fall flat, there is very little here for me to recommend.",You're Next
10,Coventry,What the hell is mumblegore?!?,6,26 December 2013,"Not even 10 years ago, all horror movie critics were full of praise for the so-called ""splat-pack""; a bunch of young and talented new arrival directors in the horror genre. Right now in 2013, we don't hear much anymore about most of this unofficial pack (including Neil Marshall, Greg McLean, Darren Lynn Bousman and others), but they seem to have been replaced with a new army of horror prodigies. Lately, all we hear about are Ti West, Adam Wingard, Joe Swanberg and Simon Barrett. Moreover they seem to be close friends, appear as actors in each other's movies and the type of films they make even received its very own subgenre name. Mumblegore, whatever the hell the characteristics may be. Do they really deserve this honor? Not quite. Ti West made a few worthwhile movies (""The Roost"", ""House of the Devil""), but their previous group project ""V/H/S"" was lamentable and this effort – released with a delay of nearly two years – is only just slightly above average.""You're Next"" opens very promising and traditional, with a mixture of good old 80's slasher setting and a post-2000 brutal home invasion concept. The wealthy and loving Davison parents host their four children and their partners at their remote countryside mansion to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary. The family dinner unfolds as normal, quarreling siblings included, but the party gets rudely interrupted when three masked and maniacal perpetrators attack the house. The sudden attack as well as the first four or five killings are extremely tense and provide the film with a uniquely mortifying atmosphere. Wingard manages to hold the suspense for a strong half hour, but then awkwardly reveals all the main plot twists and compensates the suspense with far-fetched character developments and grotesque black humor. The film remains somewhat enjoyable, thanks to the apt performance of lead actress (and kick-ass lady) Sharni Vinson and inventive (gruesome) death traps. What I appreciated most about this film was that they cast the wondrous Barbara Crampton as the mother. The horror diva of ""Re-Animator"" and ""From Beyond"" is well past 50 years of age, but she still looks fabulous!",You're Next
11,michaelRokeefe,Family reunion is site of berserk killings.,9,2 September 2013,"Ghastly, graphic violence is filtered with tension, horror and a bit of comedy. The Davidson family is getting together to celebrate mom and dad's 35th wedding anniversary in their vacation home, in the woods or course. It has been a while since the three brothers and daughter have gathered together...this family's dysfunction is not well hidden. They all bring girlfriends/close friends. Director and screenwriter, Adam Wingard and Simon Barett, start the bloody, blatant butchering with the Dwight Twilley Band's ""Looking For The Magic"" put in the CD player and set on repeat. Before the gathering can start to make merry, one by one the family and guests are attacked by black-suited assailants wearing animal masks. Crossbows and machetes serve the attacker's purpose of ruthless murder well; but the monstrous slaying is interrupted by one house-guest(Sharni Vinson)that is well trained to fight back. If you like your violence bloody, you've got it! One method of killing is quite humorous. Twilley's haunting tune is featured throughout with a few sight gags laced in as the once-predators become the prey! This is home invasion on steroids. Filmed in and around Columbia, Missouri. Yes, there is some nudity/sexuality to help make an R rating. The Australian beauty, Vinson, is outstanding. Others in the cast: AJ Bowen, Nicolas Tucci, Wendy Glenn, Amy Seimetz and Rob Moran.",You're Next
12,hitchcockthelegend,Bloody and bloody good fun.,8,13 February 2014,"You're Next is directed by Adam Wingard and written by Simon Barrett. It stars Sharni Vinson, Nicholas Tucci, Wendy Glenn, A.J. Bowen and Joe Swanberg. Music is by Mads Heldtberg and cinematography by Andrew Palermo.The Davison family and partners meet up for a family reunion at a remote holiday home and quickly find that their inner issues are the least of their worries.The splinter of horror that encompasses home invasion, that most terrifying of subject matters, has had enough filmic entries to actually fill a house! So when another one comes along with good hype and a promise of reinvigorating the formula, it's cause for horror film fans to start salivating.You're Next doesn't reinvent anything, but it consistently and confidently keeps the formula well oiled and proves to be one of the better films of its type. The set up is standard, a big old country house in the woods, a whole bunch of likable and dislikable people, and of course some outside assailants about to unleash hell on everyone in the house. Refreshingly this is not a roll call of pretty teenagers being stalked and slashed, this is an assorted bunch, young and old, all shapes and sizes, and the family bickering that precedes the carnage is a smart move, because once family members start getting killed there's a genuine sense of grief and regret coursing through those yet to be sliced and diced.It's nice to find that Wingard has great respect for his target audience, he's made a film for fans of the sub-genre and inserted a darkly comic streak that pays off royally. It's often very nudge nudge and wink winkery, but always in the right places. The director also proves to have a devilish eye for a murder scene, with some of the killings here high grade in blood, physicality and originality. Elsewhere the makers give us a great heroine, a truly resourceful gal that fights back with a ferocity that's both sexy and frightening, and while the revelation of why these events are happening is hardly original – or that the back story given for our heroine's skills is just silly – Wingard plonks it all together with such bloody verve it hardly matters.Some less than good acting from a couple of the cast, and the overuse of shaky-cam stops it from going through the roof out into the genius stratosphere, but this is a cracker of a home invasion horror and well worth a night in with the lights off and the volume tuned up loud. 8/10",You're Next
13,Scarecrow-88,You're Next,9,6 September 2016,"Ferocious, grisly, mean-spirited slasher certainly proves that blood is not thicker than water, with a family gathering for their parents/in-laws anniversary dinner is turned into a massacre as hired animal-masked killers (equipped with crossbow, machete, axes, etc.) set out to murder *nearly* everyone inside. What they (and those that hired them) don't anticipate is that one of the son's girlfriends, Erin (Sharni Vinson), has survivalist training thanks to a paranoid doomsday prepping father in her native Outback. Erin doesn't realize, though, that some of those she's trying to protect are actually behind all of it! Positively violent with quite a twist on the final girl: she's all sweet and bubbly, totally ready to be a part of this big family, gushing with good spirits, but when threatened she's proved to be quite the warrior. As true crime dictates: parents with big bucks can sure have a target on their back! Major complaint by me: the heroine is punished by the screenwriters for whatever reason after all she goes through thanks to a rigged door trap with a roped ax at the end. Other than that, the film's plot is just a basic framework while the driving force is what Erin does to all the scumbags that hurt innocent family members, including those willing to kill their own out of greed. Erin is an absolute badass; she's a human weapon in the same vein as Jason Statham. She is stabbed in the leg and shoulder yet can take out two people (admittedly, the two are not adept at fighting) with a steak knife and blender (yes, a blender!). There are some brutal throat injuries: one due to a running sprint right into fishing line, and a second when the father is slit with a machete right in front of his son) unexpectedly. Erin even rigs a plankboard with nails that one of the killers steps on. No slasher weapon is left in the tool bag. Erin stabs a guy in the face with a screwdriver and bashes another in the head with a meat tenderizer. Hearkening to the old Cane and Able incident, one brother keeps stabbing his other brother with screwdrivers, just begging for him to die! Good to see Barbara Crampton in horror movies again, still so lovely, but paying a heavy price for being the wife of a very wealthy man. A.J. Bowen, of Ti West (he also has a cameo as the underground filmmaker boyfriend of one of the daughters of the family) films, is Erin's fiancé, soft-spoken and sheepish, but there's a dark side to him she will inevitably uncover. This movie is not for the squeamish. This is all about flesh and bloodflesh is ripped and torn, and the blood flows freely. The lamb and fox masks make for quite a visual image for some of the killersuntil Erin vanquishes them. Nothing about the plot is extraordinary, but Wingard (including an underscore that isn't overwhelming but punctuates the situational violence with a synth rhythm that works) has the talent to keep his film moving through one kill set-piece after another. Larry Fessenden has a brief cameo at the beginning as one of the first victims. The ""You're Next"" written in blood and lipstick might be the film's iconic slasher image in years to come when new fans of the genre discover it.",You're Next
14,Hey_Sweden,Visceral enough to be watchable.,6,10 October 2014,"Paul and Aubrey (Rob Moran and the lovely Barbara Crampton of ""Re-Animator"" fame) are parents of adult children, now about to celebrate their 35th wedding anniversary. So their family - a fairly combative bunch - gather at the family homestead for the occasion. Unfortunately, the situation becomes dire in a hurry as a trio of animal-masked goons (one of them played by screenwriter Simon Barrett) have already slaughtered the neighbours and then proceed to terrorize and murder these dumb schmucks.""You're Next"" has its moments, as well as the standard bad character decisions one may come to expect from this sort of home invasion horror. The characters, too, aren't that interesting or fleshed out enough to be that likable, so some viewers may root for the antagonists by default. Certainly the degree of sadism and splatter on display may be enough to satisfy some in the audience. The one spin that Barrett and editor / director Adam Wingard put on the material is to make one of the potential victims a real tough cookie. Erin (Sharni Vinson) is able to fight the creeps in a major way, having been brought up by a survivalist father.As for the ""big"" plot twist that takes place around the 54 minute mark, it may work for some people, but the motivation behind the entire sorry escapade is a pretty old cliché that further drains the film of effectiveness. To add to that, the antagonists are eventually seen much too much and given too much dialogue for them to be that intimidating. Wingard does invest his film with some style - he sure does love his close-ups - in any event.The acting is tolerable at best, although it is nice to see Ms. Crampton back in a major film role. Vinson does pretty well at the business of ass kicking.Unfortunately, the final twist - and subsequent confrontation - comes as no surprise, and the moment is drawn out much too long.All in all, ""You're Next"" is moderately amusing as these things go.Wingards' filmmaking peers Larry Fessenden, Ti West, and Joe Swanberg all have roles in the film.Six out of 10.",You're Next
15,preppy-3,Very good and VERY gory,8,1 September 2013,"This is all about a bunch of siblings and their significant others, gathered together to celebrate their parents 35th anniversary. They're all in a huge house in the middle of nowhere. The siblings don't get along and are arguing almost right away when they are suddenly attacked from men in creepy animal masks outside. The family is trapped in the house, their cell phones don't work and the men outside are intent on killing everyone.OK--I pretty much figured out who was doing it and why (they do give you plenty of clues) so there was no big mystery. Still the film worked. It's never dull, the tension builds up nicely, all the acting is good and it's gory. VERY VERY gory! Blood and guts go flying every which way in this movie. It really works when the family gets one of the killers and gives them what's coming to them. Whether that's a good or bad thing is up to you. Even better the characters are believable and act exactly as you would expect people to act in this situation. Most of the women in this film are strong, fearless and fight back which is another point in its favor. There's also some intentional humor with some very funny lines that actually help to lessen the tension. Also it's great to see Barbara Crampton (""Re-Animator"", ""From Beyond"") back in a horror film and Sharni Vinson is a FANTASTIC Final Girl. There's also a few twists at the end that I didn't see coming. Fast, vicious, very gory and (in a way) fun. Worth seeing.",You're Next

In the middle of things masked assailants attack them and begin to kill them one by one. But the intruders haven't counted on the girlfriend (Sharni Vinson) of one of the sons, who has had survivalist training and isn't going down without a fight.The cast is good. Sharni Vinson is amazing in her kick-ass role. I hope to see this actress in many more movies. The only other movie I've seen her in was the silly but enjoyable shark-in-a-supermarket movie ""Bait"" and she was good in it. I appreciate that she got to keep her Aussie accent in this movie. It really made little difference to the plot but often times they make foreign actors use American accents for fear American audiences won't accept them in a movie with an American cast and setting. That's stupid, of course, but it's how the business goes sometimes. The only other actors in the cast that I really noticed were famed '80s scream queen Barbara Crampton as the mom and Joe Swanberg as one of the sons. Swanberg is an actor and director most will probably know from ""V/H/S"" I think. He's not the best actor, particularly in dramatic scenes, but he has an everyman quality that's kind of hard to dislike. He does better with the lighter stuff, like when his character is being a total jerk. He's the closest thing to comic relief the film has. Director Adam Wingard I only know from the two ""V/H/S"" movies. He did a good segment in the first movie and a mediocre segment in the second. His direction here is pretty good. Not a touchdown but he doesn't fumble the ball so that's a win for him. I enjoyed the music score. Especially the '80s-style synth track that plays in the last half. Sort of Carpenteresque. My feelings on home invasion and torture porn horror movies is that I generally hate them. Not just hate -- I LOATHE them. I am not a nihilistic person by nature so movies that are about nothing but people being tortured and abused with no other plot or redeeming qualities leave me cold. I like horror movies that entertain and have scares. I don't mind gore or violence when done in concert with a good story but if that's all a movie has to offer then I'm usually not entertained by it. So I was not looking forward to this movie because the promotion I saw for it made it seem like another ""The Strangers"" or something. Thankfully it's far better than that. I hesitate to even call it a horror movie but more of a thriller. At no point was I scared but I was glued to the screen in anticipation of what was going to happen next, particularly in the last half hour or so. The thing I liked most about it is that it's not just another movie about masked marauders terrorizing innocents in their home. One of the victims knows how to fight back and it makes for a much more interesting movie. There are the inevitable contrivances that seem to always happen in order for the plot to progress, such as people not staying together as a group but separating even though that's the last thing any reasonable person would do in such a situation. But that's not a problem exclusive to this movie so I will cut it some slack on that. The twists are also somewhat predictable but nothing that detracts from the film greatly.It really is an entertaining movie. If you're worried that it's going to be too dark or too depressing or any of that, don't be. Not everybody survives but most of the kills are quick and there are no rapes or gross-out effects to cope with. It is bloody and violent but it doesn't wallow in it. So, if you're like me and you like horror and thriller films but you don't like nihilistic movies where they embrace sickos who torture everybody and get away with it, then give this one a shot. It was way better than I expected it to be.",You're Next

19,evanston_dad,A Good Premise But Only a So-So Movie,6,2 April 2014,"""A"" for effort I guess, but ""You're Next"" is better as an idea on paper than it is as a movie.The home invasion premise is given a jolt of originality when one of the house guests turns out to have grown up in a survivalist commune and knows how to fight back. That's not the only plot twist in this film, even if you can spot the others a mile away. I appreciated the film's attempts to do something clever in a genre that normally seems content to make a minimum of effort, but I couldn't help but wish that it had just worked better. The tone teeters erratically between horror thriller and black comedy, never landing in one place long enough to be effective as either. It certainly kept me watching, but the predominant feeling I had when it was over was that of an opportunity somewhat wasted.Grade: B",You're Next

Bowen, Joe Swanberg: Revolting horror film about the presence of evil. The plot is as simple as a grade one spelling test. It regards a very large wealthy family that get together and all of a sudden crossbow arrows are shot through the windows killing a few of them. These killers emerge with animal masks while the family emerge with no common sense. Every stupid move these morons can make they go out of their way to make. They split up, they run outside, they leave others alone claiming, ""I'm right behind you."" The violence is extreme and graphic for desperate horror fans. The one victim worth her salt is Sharni Vinson who plays the girlfriend of one of the males in the family, and seems to be the only one with a brain. Luckily for her she is a survivalist, which proves a major problem for these mask wearing rejects. Director Adam Wingard presents tension and suspense but with characters this brain dead it is difficult to sympathize. There is also a plot turn that isn't difficult to figure out and it is even more revolting when fathoming what makes a person go this route in life. The house is big and provides for a great location but it deserves a better screenplay to play out its ominous appeal. There is nothing redeeming about this pathetic nonsense. We witness several methods of murder presented and the reaction is disturbing. Are these creative murders suppose to be cheered? The only element worth cheering is the closing credits because it indicates that this pointless junk is over. Score: 3 ½ / 10",You're Next
22,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Stellar home-invasion effort at the top of the genre,10,23 February 2016,"Gathered together for a family dinner, members of an estranged family suddenly find themselves in a tense fight for survival when their home is invaded by masked psychopaths intent on killing them for no reason and must band together to fight them off.This here was quite the fun and enjoyable take on the home-invasion type of story. What really sends this one going along nicely is the fact that there's such a strong amount of action in here that makes this one so thrilling. There's so much fun to be had here with the film bringing the initial invasion so early into this that there's just a near non-stop relentlessness to the action here by really making it about their need to get out from the constant attacks featured here that makes for a truly outstanding time here. That initial attack here is quite fun with the crossbow-arrow attack on the group sitting around the table and their need for cover after several are hit as they try to escape. That leads into strong escape attempts later with the group finding traps alongside the house in strong prevention techniques that keep them inside, and there's some effectively brutal sequences there that makes this one quite a bit of fun due to that. That also leaves the confrontations throughout here as bringing plenty of fine action to this, as the fist brawl up in the parents' bedroom, the encounter in the neighbor's living room as a supposed rescue attempt is squandered and the battle in the wrecked dining room where they finally manage to dispose of one of them makes for quite a fun series of scenes here which all gives this plenty of enjoyable action set-pieces. The big fun though comes from the finale where they manage to get into a series of great brawls with the killers which makes for some even better encounters where they finally turn the tables on the group with some incredibly suspenseful stalking across the house that leaves this with an incredibly strong finish to this. Along with the plentiful gore from the numerous kills and the imposing group of killers that gets a lot of mileage out of their masks and costumes, there's a lot to like here. There's really only one small area here that doesn't really work well for this which comes from the explanation offered as for why the whole invasion occurs. It's a lame and utterly meaningless excuse that doesn't serve the movie well at all and really undoes the whole thing here by pointing out how ludicrous the whole affair really is. It's the only thing keeping this down as there's so much more to like here.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",You're Next

The trailer looked promising and it had it's release just the day before this writing in Europe. I picked it up and watched it just to see what's it all about.Of course the promotion for this flick had done it's work. If you have Barbara Crampton (Aubrey)in it who became famous with Re-animator (1985) then you can bet that a lot of geeks from the genre will pick this up. One thing I can't agree with is the fact that it sold as a comedy. I can't see anything in it for a laugh. In fact, it surely delivers some creepy moments especially in the beginning when things start to go wrong. You just can't see what will happen and how it will turns out.You have to sit through the family reunion and start to know the characters for a 15 minutes but from that on things suddenly turn into mayhem. Once the attack starts it surely will remind you of The Strangers (2008) but here more is going on. Once you know who and what is happening in the house this creepy flick turns into a revenge flick. Maybe the ending was funny with the cop entering the house but I can't say that from the whole flick. It do has a few nasty and gory moments and you just don't know who is indeed next.

Really tight with great shots and gore aplenty, this speaks along after the introductory opening as the family gathers. Home invasion, yes, but much more with great set up and for once everything makes sense (in the end). There is a reason why one of the girls is so adept and all the extraordinary and crazy happenings really do come together. Maybe not as scary as it might have been and suffers a little with the earlier film simply because this is confined, more or less, to a single set. Performances were fine, there seemed to be far too many people introduced at first but then the more there are to die (horribly) the more gore and spectacular effects there are.

27,StevePulaski,Still not a normal cabin in the woods,9,24 August 2013,"Adam Wingard's You're Next is a nasty little genre-exercise, and it's one I wouldn't mind watching again anytime soon. It's directed, written, and executed with a clear devotion to the films that paved the way for the modern horror genre, and lead by a cast of independent filmmakers (and directed by one who has proved his love for the genre), it wins a longtime fan of the genre over completely. The film features more identifiable commentary than June's underwhelming thriller The Purge.Wingard's latest endeavors have been with the horror anthology franchise V/H/S, both films being a showcase for independent talents to show off their aptitude for the genre. I responded to both of Wingard's segments in those films with admiration, as I saw that he was a very competent talent who clearly knew what worked and what didn't in terms of horror. In You're Next, he gets ninety-four minutes to show off his style, taking the tiresome home-invasion plot to a new level with strong twists and scenes of gruesome brutality that come off as slick and stylish rather than mean-spirited and soulless.The story revolves around a family reconnecting at their old vacation house in the middle of the woods. This much we already know if we've seen this type of film enough times. The family consists of the mother and father (Barbara Crampton and Rob Moran), their kids (Joe Swanberg, A.J. Bowen, Amy Seimetz, and Nicholas Tucci), and the kids' significant others (Sharni Vinson, Wendy Glenn, Margaret Laney, and Ti West). During dinner one night, one of them notices something by the window, and is immediately struck in the head by an arrow shot the window. The family panics and runs around the home, trying to board up windows and doors, some of them being shot in the process, making for a horrifically bloody affair. Wingard and writer Simon Barrett waste no time with the material and allow it to move briskly, with constant mayhem and violence, but never losing its sense of tension and suspense. Just the thought of being in a ramshackle home with an unknown number of masked-goons outside, shooting arrows from a crossbow trying to kill you with an unknown motive is frightening, and Wingard makes it a startling affair for the audience.Some characters choose to sit and wait, some bravely run out there (another attempts but doesn't even make it out the front door), and some take matters into their own hands, constructing Home Alone-esque traps in order to combat against the vicious attacks of those outside. The lack of characterization to these people is a bummer, but it's a blessing to know they're not the sourest bunch of horror movie characters we've ever seen. They crack jokes, they argue at times, they play with each other, etc. Just the fact that we see people like Bowen and Seimetz, or Swanberg and West (both independent filmmakers who worked on a segment for the original V/H/S) will put a smile on anyone's face who has followed underground cinema these last few years. There's a hilarious scene in the film that comes when the entire family is around the dinner table, and Swanberg's Drake is asking West's Tariq what it's like to be an independent documentary filmmaker. ""I showed my film at an underground film festival,"" Tariq states, to which Drake replies, ""Underground? What is that? Is it shown underground?"" Barrett makes the humor subtle and not outright centered on sex and ridiculous activities conducted by twentysomethings. The humor comes from subtle cracks at each other and not from the typical events of horror films where you can tell they want you to laugh. Barrett also, wisely, refrains from making the humor contrast abruptly with the violence and gore, making him a cautious writer in a genre which is driven by reckless violence. There's no style to the content, no grace in the material, and no investment in the project. Everyone involved here seems to be having fun and that's another thing that counts in a horror film.From the first kill you can tell Wingard knows exactly what he is doing in terms of showcasing the deaths of the characters in the film. When the arrow goes through the character's skull, making it the first kill of the film, before showing the body collapse like a ragdoll, Wingard adopts a minimalist style of showing the broken window, the family's reaction, and the dripping blood before showing the physical body crumbling. That kind of suspense is invaluable to a film like this.How easy it would've been for You're Next to be typical horror-fare, relying on excess rather than structure and energy. There is gore, there is a lot of violence, and there is a lot of brutality, but thanks to Wingard's direction and Barrett's careful writing, this doesn't seem like a morose, hopeless genre-endeavor. It's one of the most fun times I've had at the movies this year, which is more that can be said for most comedies.Starring: Barbara Crampton, Rob Moran, Joe Swanberg, A.J.

28,Hellmant,Everything you'd expect from Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett!,9,28 August 2013,"'YOU'RE NEXT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Another home invasion flick, this one is from filmmakers Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett. The two have teamed together on a number of other horror films including 'A HORRIBLE WAY TO DIE', 'WHAT FUN WE WERE HAVING', 'AUTOEROTIC' and segments in the anthology films 'V/H/S', 'V/H/S/2' and 'THE ABCS OF DEATH'. Wingard once again directed and edited the movie and Barrett wrote it. This slasher flick revolves around a family having a reunion at their vacation home (out in the middle of nowhere) when they're attacked by ax-wielding (and crossbow shooting) killers. It stars Sharni Vinson (an Australian beauty known for sequels like 'STEP UP 3D' and 'BLUE CRUSH 2'), Nicholas Tucci, Wendy Glenn, Rob Moran, Barbara Crampton, Margaret Laney, filmmaker Ti West (who also wrote and directed segments in 'V/H/S' and 'THE ABCS OF DEATH') and a slew of actors from other Wingard and Barrett films like AJ Bowen, Joe Swanberg, Amy Seimetz, L.C. Holt and Lane Hughes. If you've seen Wingard and Barrett's work before it's everything you'd expect from them; nothing but exceptional grade A horror entertainment.The film all takes place at the Davisons' remote vacation house. Paul and Aubrey Davison (Moran and Crampton) are celebrating their wedding anniversary and their three sons and daughter (all adults now) have joined them (with their significant others). The reunion gets off to a rocky start as two of the sons engage in a heated argument, at dinner, when things become even more crazy as the family is attacked by masked murderers (carrying axes and crossbows). The killers find out they've taken on more than they bargained for when they discover one of the Davison boys' girlfriends (Vinson) has a secret skill.The story isn't too original but the film is creative in the way it delivers it (and there are a few twists; I didn't see the one involving Vinson's character coming and there's another big twist at the film's ending). The movie is creepy and brutally violent but also darkly comedic, it's everything Wingard and Barrett have grown to be experts at. Vinson is a gorgeous and likable horror movie heroine and the rest of the cast is all more than adequate in their roles as well. The film, like all great horror movies (and good movies in general), is just a great collaboration. This is a skill that all quality movies depend on but it's something the horror genre is especially good at because horror filmmakers (as well as cast and crew) are a lot more supportive of each other. I once saw an interview with director Eli Roth in which he said horror filmmakers are like 'one big family' and way more supportive of one another than any other genre. They see one filmmaker's success as a success for all rather than as competition. This really shows in great horror movies as it's more than apparent in this film!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JQ4A-I9-JM",You're Next

I think I avoided this home-invasion horror because the advertisements seemed a little: The-Strangers-ask-Would-You-Rather-Trespass-or-Purge? and I am done with unoriginal concepts.Mercifully, I finally gave it a shot (to the end of the film) because for about the first 80% of the film I thought I had it pegged as I've seen these movies over and over again. I was wrong and the twisted (or realistic?) ending had me loving the movie as a whole. In fact, it's been about a month since I've seen it and I cannot wait to see it again.Yes, it is a home invasion movie, sort of. Yes, it does involve ludicrous masks and an age-old plot – once discovered. But, it does have a KICK ASS Heroine of this Horror. The likes we haven't seen since 1984's A Nightmare on Elm Street – which this does borrow heavily from.Basically a richer than rich family settles down to dinner in the typical cell-free outskirts home and all hell breaks loose as someone/people attempt to kill them one-by-one. Why? Well, you'll learn that soon enough. By whom? Again, that's coming, too.The real joy is journeying alongside our heroine and hope she makes it out alive.Give it a chance. Try and figure it out.

31,Robert_duder,30 years ago and this would be a cult slasher today,6,1 September 2013,"I was amazed to discover how much horror fans seem to be latching onto this. I think I can see it becoming a cult classic before my very eyes. I do understand where they are coming from. I think the makers of this film inadvertently created a near perfect copy of the type of horror film that would have been massive in the 80's. People are right, it is unique in some ways and it doesn't blatantly copy other horror films, it just has a unique indie style that is reminiscent of other films started in that time (Halloween, Friday The 13th etc) To me personally it doesn't even hold a candle to those horror classics but I also see the good in it too. The film appears very low budget...the lowest budget Horror film I've seen in theatres in a very long time. This was the type of movie that goes straight to DVD and you wonder where it came from. It was so campy in some spots and horrifyingly gory in others. Some of the performances felt strained and unprofessional and yet again it channelled some similar performances of 80's horror that were so iconically bad. I suppose my biggest issue with the film was that it wasn't scary in the least. It was gory certainly but it never scared, not once. It looks creepy in the trailers but never once gets under your skin for any psychological horror aspect.Sharni Vinson was absolutely the highlight in the film as far as performances go. She was a bad-ass scream queen who didn't do any screaming but rather uses her unusual talents to take down the intruders in what I could only think of as an R-Rated version of Home Alone. Vinson was excellent and I wanted to see more from her character but what we got was good enough. I literally felt like everyone else were like watching a High School performance. They ranged from barely tolerable to awful. Barbara Crampton as the mother was atrocious. She was campy and ridiculous and every line she gave and every scream she let out makes you laugh and not fear for anything. Rob Moran was almost as bad as the father but he at least seems like he's taking it seriously or trying to. Nicholas Tucci, Joe Swanberg, Amy Seimetz, and Ti West have roles of varying degrees but almost all of them were borderline awful. Their campy delivery and awful acting was unforgivable. If they were trying to create a campy horror flick then I suppose they were successful but it came across as more irritating than anything. AJ Bowen is okay in his role as Vinson's boyfriend. His character is so much better before the twist in the film and then suddenly he becomes almost as campy as everyone else is. However, the closing scene with Bowen and Vinson is twisted, disturbing and well delivered. Wendy Glenn is okay in her role as well but her character is so incredibly stereotypical and predictable. She does manage to deliver one of the bizarre/absurdly funny/campy/shocking line that I can think of in any horror film and if it weren't for the shock I would have laughed out loud. I can't even begin to reprint it here but you'll know when you hear it.The cast together has virtually zero chemistry with each other. The overacting and melodramatic screaming is absurd even for a slasher flick. Director Adam Wingard certainly knows horror and more so he knows his way around a low budget. You're Next was nowhere near a total mess. I don't for a second feel that it was ""terrifying"" in the least but it was a near perfect homage...no mirror image...of great indie low budget 80's horror. Everything about the film is simplistic except for the kills. The blood, guts and gore are really well done, nauseating and high end for a low budget flick. I think with a stronger supporting cast and a much tighter script, some editing to the story and this could have been a truly top notch horror. It seems to be impressing true fans and I get what they see but to me it didn't hold up quite as well as it could have. 6.5/10",You're Next
32,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"No, you are.",8,3 October 2021,"Subversion is the name of the game in 'You're Next (2011)', a home-invasion slasher with a post-modern twist. The picture sets itself up in a derivative way reminiscent of most entries in its genre, then prides itself on subverting every single trope that it has just established. In some ways, it feels like a horror movie set in the 'real world', with smart yet fallible characters and bluntly consequential violence. It's incredibly satisfying to see its protagonist - a final girl to rule all final girls - fight back against her attackers. Even though she's incredibly capable, it never feels as though she's read the script; she simply has the knowledge, constitution and ability to survive. Like I said, it's incredibly satisfying (even if it eventually becomes a little unsurprising). It's also a ton of fun. The first time our hero takes on one of the animal-masked attackers is a shocking, almost cheer-inducing moment of pure genre genius. Its violence almost acts as punctuation, each act of aggression resulting in tangibly bloody carnage. It's so convincing and visceral that it almost hurts. The picture itself takes a little while to get going and some of its acting is a bit ropey. However, once it moves into its second act and its action finally kicks off, it just keeps getting better and better. It's a violent, vicious and often genuinely unexpected slice of horror heaven.

Hangover hit so buddy comedies are the way to go and since the success of Twilight vampires have been the go to idea. The horror genre is a little different. Rather then a specific idea the goal is to either slice people up like in Saw, or ""found footage"" like Blair Witch. Either one you pick you have to do it all on a tiny budget so you make enough to warrant sequel. After all the huge hype behind this I was expecting something a little scary at least. It may be my age and the fact that I grew up with horror like Poltergist and Nightmare On Elm Sreet but just because you cut people up doesn't automatically make it scary.

Although 'You're Next' also has some subtle black humor, it is more restrained, and there's a number of very disturbing, bloody and even gory-ish scenes. The film is also loaded with highly effective jump scares - every scare justified by something actually happening, and not simply someone placing a hand on someone's shoulder, accompanied by loud blaring music. Nope, these were real scares and the score was also effective.Sharni Vinson is excellent as the film's protagonist, Erin, and her character turned out to be a nice surprise.

39,sol-,Family Plot,7,11 August 2017,"Tensions flare between the grown-up children of a wealthy couple at a dinner party until the siblings realise that they are under home invasion attack in this thriller from 'The Guest' director Adam Wingard. As per 'The Guest', one of the best asset of 'You're Next' is the 1980s style music score, though the greatest virtue of the project is Sharni Vinson's performance as one sibling's mild-mannered girlfriend who has a surprising knack for fending off the antagonists. The film also has an intelligent twist around halfway in that spins the material in a very different direction. Twist aside though, the first half of the movie does a remarkable job showing the power of adversity to bring even the most divided family together as they band together to survive. Indeed, the entire project could be read as a parable of dysfunctional families in contemporary times. All that said and done, one does have to endure some second-rate supporting performances. Sections of the dialogue also comes off as forced with the conversations between the antagonists in the second half often only seeming to exist to deliver unnecessary exposition. In general though, this is riveting stuff, topped off with a memorable conclusion and final scene. The creaky manor and outskirts location are also pitch perfect with the film simply soaked with atmosphere.",You're Next
40,eddie_baggins,This is why I love Horror movies!,7,22 January 2014,"This, ladies and gentlemen, is why I love horror movies.Funny, sharp, frightening, gory and outrageously entertaining, Adam Wingard's home-invasion shocker handles the intricacies of sibling showmanship and the unfortunate truth that family values are all-but non-existent better than any drama or comedy, full of pretence and contrivances could've hoped, and is helped immensely by Simon Barrett's tremendous writing and a performance by Australian Sharni Vinson that will undoubtedly ensure she will place at the top of any director's wish list for a long while.Gathering for the 35th wedding anniversary of their wealthy parents (Rob Moran, horror legend Barbara Crampton) are quirky, likable and clearly in love couple Crispian (AJ Bowen) and Erin (Vinson), Crispian's older brother and Alpha-Male with inner-anguish and relationship troubles Drake (Joe Swanberg) and his icy wife Kelly (Margaret Laney), their ditzy yet awkwardly determined sister Aimee (Amy Seimetz) and her filmmaker boyfriend Tariq (Ti West, brilliantly sending up his own persona) and estranged criminal brother Felix (Nicholas Tucci) accompanied by his strange girlfriend Zee (Wendy Glenn). Things begin nicely, with hugs, kisses and handshakes exchanged as per a normal reunion, before, again as per a normal reunion, the bickering and bullying at dinner begins. This time however, instead of the arguments ending in someone storming off to their bedroom, the room is a little more shocked to discover an arrow bloodily piercing the cranium of someone in the room that'll put anyone off dessert.Sharni Vinson. Super cool. Sharni Vinson. Super cool.What happens next is a pure delight for genre fans, as a character hilariously, stubbornly goes-on despite the crossbow bolt lodged in his back, another happens upon the ghastly remains of the next-door neighbours and we are reminded to always, ALWAYS, look under the bed. With so many exceptional moments, and plot twists that thankfully work without feeling forced, picking a favourite is a monumental task; my pick ultimately being Ti West as Tariq defending his occupation, and announcing his feat of having his feature documentary premiere at an ""underground"" film festival to Drake as he declares TV Commercials the pinnacle of the art form and belittles Tariq into submission. Then there's the ending, which hinted at being oh so terrible and undoing all the great work performed, before a second punch-line saves it and sends off proceedings in a blunt, pitch-perfect tradition.Adam Wingard, though not yet appearing as accomplished and polished as West (The House of the Devil, The Innkeepers, The Sacrament), is a director with a clear passion for un-restrained horror, and with his work on the V/H/S films as well as this has proved that he will pioneer his brand of bloody film for a long while yet. Support him, and the renaissance of American independent horror by grabbing You're Next at the earliest possible convenience and basking in its undiluted, unapologetic, simply unreal awesomeness; this is a film that will one day be heralded in the same league as Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead (1981) and John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) as an exhilarating thrill ride featuring an iconic cult hero, razor sharp wit and an ingeniously simple scenario.And seriously, Sharni Vinson is just too cool.5 ""documentary commercials"" out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",You're Next
41,filipemanuelneto,Better than I was expecting.,5,28 March 2017,"When this movie came out, horror films about house breaking were in vogue, so its not difficult to find great similarities between this film and others from that period such as ""The Last House on the Left"" or ""The Strangers"". The formula works out. The problem is the film takes time to get interesting, presenting us characters that we never care about and who will soon be slaughtered before our eyes like pigs in late Fall. The proof of our disinterest is that we soon forget who is married to or is dating what person there. In fact, this is totally ancillary. The strong point of the film is the way one of the characters, Erin (Sharni Vinson), reacts to the threat, quickly revealing the central character in an excellent twist. This is something so positive that we have come to ignore the poor explanation given for this reaction, with that ragged story of survival training. The actress did a good job, standing out from the rest of her peers, who mostly make poor performances, but within what we could expect. Thus, the film goes from an uninteresting horror to a movie that we can see with pleasure, even if it only surprises us once.",You're Next
42,videorama-759-859391,"Great titled movie, lacking many scares, yet not a bad yarn",6,30 August 2014,"I was really hanging out to see this. The film does start out promising, but then becomes really sloppy, where the big twist made up the apology, of what followed before, but then that apology was retracted. Another twist comes near the end, where I sort of saw it coming earlier. Vinson does well as the ocker girlfriend, who visits this wealthy estate home with her boyfriend. She's really matured as an actress where I'd say she was almost the best in this sloppy picture. The way, You're Next is shot, makes it very different from many horror film around around this decade. It's very clearly shot. With other family members gathering, it isn't long before killers in piggy masks, armed with crossbows, do their thing, where our family are kept trapped inside. Honestly, what does the first victim do? Runs straight outside. No nous at all. The killers have made one very sore mistake (think of the Death Wish 3, hammered nails in wood scene). They've overlooked girlfriend, Vinson, who's a survival expert. I like that. It also becomes clear very soon, the killers reasons for being there, something I do say, I never saw coming. One just can't overlook the sloppiness of the film. There's no real fear factor, except early on in the piece, where most of the film isn't scary, because of the killer's intentions, suspense minimal. We know who they are outside these big intimidating masks. But it was great to see Sharni carry the film. It was disappointing, the real hot Crampton, scream queen and great character actress, who's was really was just used as eye candy in the 80's (esp. Fraternity Vacation) the ill mother who's killed early on in this one. Though what I liked beside the effective masks, and that great rockin', was as I said, the film sets itself apart from others, if with a style, again with some heavy unbelievable gore.

Bad guys wearing animal masks dole out most of the carnage, and because their is comic relief in between, I was entertained for the entire ninety five minutes.

45,dfranzen70,Searing horror,7,25 August 2013,"What starts out as a peaceful family reunion in a secluded home quickly devolves into utter madness and hysteria when a family is inexplicably attacked by assailants wearing animal masks. But the bad guys haven't reckoned on the tenacity of one of the guests - from outside of the family - who becomes a thorn in their sides (and head, and arms, and so on). You're Next is an unequivocal scare ride, impressive enough to make one forgive the occasional lapses in logic.First to arrive are the mother and father, Paul and Aubrey. They plan to renovate the house, sort of a retirement project for Paul (who had worked for a defense contractor). Shortly thereafter, Aubrey thinks she hears footsteps upstairs. Paul goes to check it out but finds nothing. Meanwhile, son Crispian (yes, that's his name) is driving up with his girlfriend Erin; he's a teacher of some repute who's probably not as successful as he'd like to be. His two brothers and sister and their respective significant others are to arrive the next day. Crispian seems like a nice enough fellow, and he explains to Erin that his family hasn't been all together in a long time. ""It'll be...interesting,"" he tells her that night. ""How so?"" she asks. ""You'll see,"" he adds mysteriously. At this point we're supposed to grasp that there are long- standing issues among the family members, as is not unheard of.The next day, the rest of the guests are on the scene. There's noticeable tension between Crispian and his brother Drake, as well as between Drake and the youngest brother, Felix. One gets the impression that there're been plenty of bickering and sniping over the years. Drake picks on both of his brothers plus his sister's boyfriend Tariq, a documentary director. And then the attack begins, and chaos reigns.People are picked off, shot by bow and arrow or hit with an axe. Some try to go for help, to no avail. Cell phone service is down, too. No one knows who's attacking the family, it seems; is this a random event, or were they selected for extermination? While most of the guests are loudly panicking, only Erin has the wherewithal to act quickly and decisively. She knows how to use weapons, including her own body. She knows how to keep intruders out. For example, she has the idea of people rushing out of the dining room while holding a chair, thus giving them some cover. She takes charge better than anyone else there seemingly can. It's not really important why she possesses these skills; it's just enough to know she can employ them. Makes for a better movie than watching a family get cut down, that's for sure.There are two things that intrigued me in this movie. One is the dazzling, breathless direction by Adam Wingard (V/H/S), which puts the viewer right in the middle of everything. This not only makes it tough to think about the motives of the family members but also gives the viewer almost no time to contemplate anything other than pure survival. Just like the family members. Aha. The second is that underlying question of why the family is being attacked, for if they've been specifically targeted, is it because the family has money, or some other, equally nefarious reason?Here are some caveats, though: the attackers seem pretty dumb, when all is said and done. Their dumbness doesn't detract from the action/violence/plot, anyway, so it's not a real issue. Along the same lines, the method behind all of the madness seems a little sketchy, even far fetched. But it's not implausible, so again it doesn't detract from the mayhem.So it turns out I liked You're Next quite a bit, although those who aren't thrilled with blood and guts and such should really not bother. There's nothing for you here. There is a story, and it's a pretty interesting one, serving as a nice backdrop for the murdering and whatnot.",You're Next

It's not. The film starts with a couple being murdered by assailants wearing animal masks and leaving a message written in blood on the walls, 'You're Next'. Their next targets are Rob and Barbara, who are celebrating their 35th wedding anniversary with their four grown children, and their significant others, out at their country house-far away from everyone, of course. A J and Nicholas are two of the visiting children and Sharni is A J's girlfriend. As the home invasion begins, things hang a left from most movies of this type. I don't want to give away too much here but when I saw where this was headed, I said to myself, 'Why hasn't this happened, before?' The less you know about the twists before you see it, the better-but if you really must know them, ask me and I'll tell you. It's a fight for survival and the violence is brutal, with the animal mask-wearing attackers using cross bows, machetes and even a sledge hammer as weapons. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexuality-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 34 minutes.

Unlike its fellow release this month, THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS: CITY OF BONES, the makers of YOU'RE NEXT have produced a flick which actually is fairly easy to follow. And, by the way, it is also entertaining, with a lead character you can care about (and who doesn't look like she's 15 years old one minute, and pushing 30 the next). Simon Barret, the writer of YOU'RE NEXT, saves the most original plot twist for last, and though many viewers may see it coming from a mile away, just HOW and WHEN it will be executed is the rewarding kicker. While the climax echos the classic Agatha Christie-novel-based flick, THEN THERE WERE NONE (a.k.a., TEN LITTLE INDIANS), it is presented in a way that, while somewhat more ambiguous, is altogether more satisfying. And just as in the Christie story and most of the better offerings in this captive-victims genre, the YOU'RE NEXT folks do an excellent job in making every single victim worthy of their fate.",You're Next

Animals don't use doors.""I can't think of a better way of spending the last day of October than having experienced this film for the first time. I am not a big horror fan, but after watching The Conjuring and now this movie I think I'm back on board with this genre. They are two very different movies, The Conjuring really creeped me out, while You're Next was extremely entertaining with lots of dark humor and interesting genre twists. I agree with the people that are comparing this movie to Scream because it is very self aware and it makes fun of horror clichés while at the same time delivering them. I would say You're Next does for home invasion horror films what Kick Ass did for super hero films. I am actually a little embarrassed that I loved this movie so much considering it features some pretty bad performances and hardly any scares at all. The opening of the film was rather predictable and it took a long time to really get going, but once the twists kicked in, the movie had me at the edge of my seat with Sharni Vinson delivering one of the most memorable female characters I've seen in a horror film since Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in Alien. She was worth the ticket price alone. You're Next is gory and violent, and it is not a movie for everyone, but this mumblegore film was so much better than I had expected. It completely blew me away despite all its flaws and lack of actual scary scenes. This will probably be the first time in more than a decade that I will have two horror movies in my best films of the year list. You're Next did everything that The Purge did wrong right. It has overtaken The Strangers as my favorite home invasion film.The less you know about the plot going into this movie the better so I will be brief here. Paul (Rob Moran) and Aubrey (Barbara Crampton) are getting ready to celebrate their 35th anniversary by having a family reunion at their country home in the middle of the woods. The first to arrive is their son Crispian (AJ Bowen) along with his girlfriend Erin (Sharni Vinson). Crispian is a teacher and Erin was a former student of his. The next day Crispian's brother Drake (Joe Swanberg) and his wife Kelly (Margaret Laney) arrive. Crispian and Drake seem to have some sort of unresolved issues going on between them. Before the important dinner celebration the rest of the family members arrive: Paul's youngest son Felix (Nicholas Tucci) with his Gothic girlfriend Zee (Wendy Glen), and Paul's only daughter Aimee (Amy Seimetz) with her documentary filmmaker boyfriend Tariq (Ti West). The table has been set for a nice little family reunion when all of a sudden these men wearing animal masks begin to attack and suddenly everyone's life is in danger. I think that the critics and some of the trailers give away too much information about this movie considering it is much more enjoyable if you go into it without knowing much about it. This is a small indie horror film with some unknown actors, but the story is really engaging and Sharni Vinson takes over the entire second half of the film with a powerful performance. She is really great in this. This is one movie I wouldn't mind watching again considering it actually might be rewarding to go back and seeing some of the things I missed out on the first time (now that I know the twists that are coming beforehand). I haven't had as much fun in a theater this year as much as I did with this film. I'm not a fan of gore, but this film used it wisely and had several funny moments that completely engaged me. It balances the humor with the horror pretty well. You're Next is a very witty film with some dark humor that isn't for everyone, but it deserves you at least give it a shot. You might just love this film as much as I did and look over its many flaws.",You're Next

All the deaths are pretty neat, with the villains certainly look the part. Sharni Vinson is memorable in the lead role of Erin, but she's really the only cast member that I enjoyed in this.The set-up, character decisions and ultimate twist are dreadful. I have a decent threshold of ignoring when characters do dumb things, but this film takes the biscuit in that regard. I was questioning so much of what they all do, to the point it got irritating. Some of the editing and camera work isn't great either.Going back to the cast. Vinson is definitely the best person onscreen, her character turns into a very cool one as the film progresses. With that said, I never felt she fitted in well. Vinson as Erin as a film's sole protagonist would be awesome, but she's unfortunately held back a lot in this.I guess if you want a 95 minute slasher that doesn't take any thinking or anything of the sort, then this is a film that's worth a watch. However, for me, the supporting elements aren't good enough to match the solid horror.",You're Next

My only complaint is I wish it would've dialed down some of the gore, the gore wasn't constant and it wasn't terribly graphic but it was a little bit too much for my taste. Also at the very beginning there is a half naked woman that walks around revealing her breasts, just to let you know, just in case nudity makes you uncomfortable. I would've liked for one or two characters to be a little bit more attractive but it's not all about how attractive an actor is, it's about how well they pull off the roles and I can honestly say all of the actors in this film did a great job pulling off their roles! 10 out of 10 for you're next, if you're a horror movie fan this is a must see!",You're Next

After the parents, the first to arrive are son Crispian (is that a real name?) and his girlfriend Erin who is Irish. Next, two more sons arrive with their significant others and a daughter and her guy. Soon after dinner starts, the sibling rivalry between Crispian and another brother begin and the whole affair is derailed by the pent-up hostility of these two. Crispian is the black sheep of the family I guess, a college teacher who never got the respect of the family. Erin was a former student, who also gets little respect.While everyone starts screaming the daughter's boyfriend looks out the window, sees something and suddenly his skull is pierced by an arrow. More arrows start flying and hurting others. Turns out everyone is pretty much dumb and useless in this situation except for...Erin, who grew up with survivalists!? Some of the villains make it into the house and pretty much everyone is a target. One of the girlfriends tries to run outside but almost loses her head in the process. So here they are confined in the house with no way out and no phone signal. Eventually Crispin escapes and Erin and the others are left to fend for themselves with Erin kicking butt. For a while the whole thing seems pointless. But eventually we get a motive and find out who is behind the attack.You're Next surprised me in how good of a horror movie it is. It's violent, a bit original, tense. I can't say that any of the characters is likable, not even our heroine Erin, but that's a given these days. It's a pretty plain and basic movie but that is perhaps its strength. It does what it does well.

Here is a film that doesn't aspire to be anything else but fun. The emphasis is not on acting of the first caliber, but on making sure than we don't waste ninety minutes of our life and throw away a dozen dollars on pretentious premises. Instead, we know than by going inside the theater we are going to be entertained, we'll scream like little girls, and we are going to laugh our heads off because it's funny, incredible, or just a plain attack of the nerves.Overall ""You're Next"" doesn't begin with steady footing. It presents the usual situation, people are in an isolated location, losing their connections to the intelligent world, and on top of that not even able to receive cable or wireless service. They're already doomed. However, there is that very annoying slasher rock song, the ubiquitous killer than seems to be smarter than anyone else in the film, and add to the usual formula a bunch of greedy people who can't stand each other, and the mix is just delicious.Before you can even read the bloody ""You're Next"" sign, you are on your way on a trip so twisty and twisted than you won't believe the ending. Soon, people are being impaled, liquefied, pureed (yes, you read that right), shot, slashed, sliced, garroted, etc., etc., and this might even include the bad guys. It's in one of the unexpected story turns than this becomes humongous entertainment. Soon, you'll see some of those annoying killers chasing their victims and for a change, vice versa.

60,peterp-450-298716,Average slasher thriller,6,19 March 2014,"""F*ck me next to your dead mom then.""Would this movie win a prize for originality ? Nope Was it scary or creepy ? Nope Were there scares in it that almost gave me a heart attack ? Yep Can you call it a horror ? Nope Were there a few memorable kills ? Yes Was it an enjoyable film for a relaxing evening ? Hell YeahThat's for sure. This was a movie that I definitely wanted to see and it was ranked on my wish list as number 1. As a fan of the better slasher films I surely place this one among the other entertaining better movies. Of course it's not really original or unique. When you're familiar with the ""Friday the 13th"" series, you know you can expect it follows the same ritual. Only this time it's not a gang of teenagers in a holiday camp who are chased by a mysterious crazy person with a hockey mask, but now it's about a family reunion which is thoroughly disturbed by several assailants wearing animal masks. And I must admit that sometimes the appearance of those masks in the background was fairly spooky.A slasher movie basically can be compared with the song ""99 Bottles of Beer"" :99 bottles of beer on the wall 99 bottles of beer. Take one down and pass it around 98 bottles of beer on the wall.In other words the structure of the movie is basically the same pattern. First you get to know a group of participants. Thereafter the first victims are piling up. Then the guessing starts. Who will ultimately be the next victim? Was the way he/she was killed inventively? And at the end you start to wonder who is behind all this and what are the motives of this person. The success of a slasher story depends on a few factors. Is there a threatening atmosphere all the time? In what way are the characters butchered and is it an original method ? Does it take long before you begin to suspect someone, who could be the ultimate culprit? If you suspect someone already early in the movie, then this is an indication that it's a predictable movie. Or they did it intentionally (as in ""The Double"" which is not a slasher film, but I use it purely as an example). And what surprise is used to end the movie?""You're next"" is not really frightening. There are a few scares (and I definitely had to gasp for breath for a moment) you actually should have seen coming. Most of the times it was just a pleasant and enjoyable movie. Only in the opening scene with the young girl peering into the darkness you can feel a real threat. As the massacre begins you can expect the better chop and cut work. Not everything was surprising, but nevertheless it was explicitly and gross mapped. Certainly the blender part is something different and rarely this fun kitchen tool is being used in this way. The last time I can remember that a blender was used in an unusual way like this, was in ""Dead Alive"". The crossbow was something unique too. The rest was just average skewering, cutting and stabbing. It was halfway in the movie when the first idea of who it might be, came up. Eventually I was still a little surprised in the end. The motivation for these gruesome actions became also clear in the end. It's not really a horror but rather a thriller. Only the end was a little too predictable and gave me a ""Yes, of course this would happen""-feeling .A slasher movie that rises above the average of others in this genre. Most positive to the film was Sharni Vinson who emerged as a true commando with some decent survival skills. Sometimes a little over the top, but that made it more fun. And for me, something I'm definitely going to remember the most is the soundtrack with the song of Dwight Twiley. Every time I hear this song, I'll definitely check if everything is closed. A great song (I never heard before) that perfectly fits this movie. A happy song put on ""repeat"". ""Looking for the magic.""Some performances however, weren't that great. Especially Bowen got on my nerves already early in this movie. And to Margaret Laney I hand over the medal for ""Most stupid decision made ever ..."". A hysterical shrieking woman, who still wants to hang around in a (not so safe) room on her own. Stupid stupid stupid .... More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",You're Next
61,aidanratesmovies,"Weaker parts aside, it's a really good movie",9,17 August 2021,"A bland start thankfully leads to an incredibly fun time- You're Next plot and battle royale kind of ordeal was largely improved upon by more recent horror films like Ready or Not, but still manages to capture the enjoyment most horror films can only dream of. First off, the obvious standout about this film is lead actress Sharni Vinson as Erin who is as bada** and cunning as she is a great actress- and thankfully well written as well. Some of the plot points throughout the film can be a bit predictable, but onced the opening 20 minutes are over, the film is a pure adrenaline rush and you can't help but want to see what happens next- whether you know it or not. The look of the film is simple but well done, and the film's score is absolutely brilliant and unique. There is also a buttload of violence throughout the film which is as harshly executed as it is fun to watch- feeling almost like an R-rated Home Alone at times. In the end, You're Next is far from the decades best horror- but it does manage to be memorable and fun in a quick fashion- and is able to make something rather original out of itself despite its weaker parts.My Rating: 8.5/10.",You're Next

64,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of You're Next,7,21 August 2014,"With smidgens of background music straight out of a 1980's John Hughes film and villains with a penchant for killing defenseless human beings by way of crossbows, You're Next exhibits a new and fresh perspective on the horror/slasher genre. Now I'm saying this based on my observation of the movie's second half. The last 45 minutes surprised me and I consider them very effective. The first half, well it resembles one of the weaker Friday the 13th sequels coupled with residue from the meaningless pile of junk that is The Strangers (2008) (""Next"" plays like a wiser, more intelligent version of said movie). At 96 fast paced minutes, You're Next isn't monumentally scary. In fact, it's a horror flick that plays more like a thriller. Does that make it less palatable? No way. Truth be told, this is an exercise that delivers a couple of nifty twists and turns that help it rise above the ordinary. And you know what, I couldn't recommend You're Next without them. I can't however, divulge who the character is that turns out to be the reluctant heroine. If you choose to take in a viewing, you'll find out for yourself that this person is a true survivalist that kinda came out of nowhere. And as the perceptive critic that I always try to be, I initially didn't pick up on it.Harboring a cast that I didn't know from Adam and taking place in I figured the middle of nowhere (of course), You're Next has a premise that goes like this: A rich family consisting of a husband, wife, and four children (all with significant others) venture out to a remote vacation home (it's not revealed where but I found out that filming took place in Columbia, Missouri) for a sort of rekindling (the vibe I get is that they haven't seen each other in quite some time). This family (last name Davison) doesn't know it yet but they are being watched and are to be eventually hunted down by henchman wearing creepy masks that resemble, I guess, bunny rabbits. What begins from that moment on is a relentless rush of terror that doesn't let up. If you like the sight of blood, ""Next"" will not disappoint. After I left the theater, I wondered budget wise, how much money was shelled out for all those gallons of red dye corn syrup.Despite that fact that this flick works, there is still something that kinda irked me about You're Next: The antagonists are revealed to not be psychopaths but strictly contract killers (hired to kill and collect a sizable amount of money). If this is the case, then why do they go out of their way to taut their victims (why do they care, it's a business transaction). An example would be writing in blood ""You're Next"" (the film's title) on a mirror after a routine offing of a neighbor. Another example would be the act of the killers tilting their head Michael Myers style (you know the dude from Halloween) after the umpteenth victim lies dying on the floor. Oh and don't get me started on the fact that they let a song play over and over on a CD player while a corpse sits lying in a chair. Seriously? If you're going to do that, at least play a song worthy of listening to (the tune on repeat sounded like a guy trying to imitate David Bowie, nice try).When it's all said and done though, You're Next has some decent acting (much better than your standard horror fare with virtual unknowns in the cast), satisfying direction for most of the way (there are some scenes with a sizable amount of jittery camera-work that I could've done without), and an effective 180 degree turn in terms of what you thought you knew about some of the characters. Then there's the ending. It's been done a few times before with other films of this nature. It's equal parts disturbing and funny here. Overall, this is not a horror classic that's going to set the world on fire, but it succeeds in trying to add a spark to what I believe to be, a tiring, over-the-hill genre of filmmaking. Regardless, this gets a recommendation from me and it's the ""next"" movie you should take in during these dog days of August.",You're Next
65,raulfaust,A Nightmare on an Eerie Street,7,27 February 2015,"""You're Next"" is a film that involves bad feelings that come out in a capitalist society, such as greed, envy and lack of respect for human life. Felix is a grown man who decides contracting people to kill his family, in order to inherit all the money they have won throughout the years. In the first moments that Felix and his girlfriend appear on screen, it was a child's play to notice that they weren't sympathetic people, but I didn't think it would be that easy to find out who is the monster behind all that savagery. The discussions involving some of the brothers are interesting, since director lets the spectator see the unspoken subjects that the relatives have been facing; it was evident that they had a lot to clear up before dining. Other than that, the story and the movie as a whole are quite simple, utilizing elements that most horror movies have already brought up; in fact, it resembles a lot the 2008's film ""The Strangers"", even thought that picture was much more impacting-- at least when it came out. Well, after watching ""You're Next"", I considered it to be an entertaining picture and so, but in my particularly opinion, Adam Wingard would be better in directing a drama film, considering he is GREAT with building tense relationship scenes, like the dinner's.",You're Next

The youngest brother Felix, his Girlfriend Zee & Crispin hiring assins with animal masks to kill the family so the can collect their inheritance! Along with them making it look like a normal break in as a cover up! The deaths were pretty great as well! Not to mention funny! Like the scene when Felix gets a blender smashed over his head then Erin plugging it in & sticking the blender on his head! Twisted & funny! Among slitting, bludgeoning & plain stabbing (some of which was quite in unique ways) like the metal wire in the door way, the axe trap in the front door & the nail boards on the ground under the windows! Not forgetting the flashing camera tactic with one of the assins!The gore level was just above average for this film! As per in others I've seen!The ending, before the credits roll however, was priceless!Overall, a great horror film that all fans of both home invasion & slasher genre will love! 10/10",You're Next
67,brando647,One of the Best Modern Slasher Films,8,30 May 2014,"Before watching YOU'RE NEXT, my exposure to the work of Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett was limited to what were arguably the weakest segments of THE ABC'S OF DEATH (where they provided the Q segment) and V/H/S (the wraparound segments) as well as the not-as-lame ghost/cybernetic eye story segment from V/H/S/2. If it weren't for all the critical praise heaped on the film from it's run on the festival circuit, I would've passed over it with no problem. But YOU'RE NEXT turned out to be one of the best horror films I've seen in the past few years. It's one of the freshest slasher films I've seen since the original SCREAM. It accomplishes this with a fun script that never loses traction and toys with the common slasher film tropes we've come to expect. The movie is about the Davisons and their gathering for the parents wedding anniversary at their new remote estate. Erin is meeting the family for the first time, eager to bring her relationship with struggling writer/teacher Crispian to the next level. On the evening of the anniversary dinner, chaos ensues as they come under assault from masked assailants armed with crossbows and machetes. The attackers come on strong and seemingly without reason while the family cowers inside. Meanwhile, the attackers soon realize they're getting more than they bargained for when Erin proves that she's more than just a pretty face. It's a perfect blend of horror and comedy that drops some humor as often as it drops another victim.Any horror film that refuses to play by the same set of rules as most others in the genre instantly earns points with me. It's why some of my more recent horror faves have included THE CABIN IN THE WOODS and TUCKER & DALE VS EVIL. You'll also notice the running theme of horror with a strong element of humor injected into the mix. A lot of horror movies are, at their core, pretty absurd in premise. Whether it be a supernatural being hunting kids in their nightmares, a seemingly indestructible being slaughtering its victims one by one, or even just your average mortal psycho with a knife stalking regular people making poor decisions, there's some level of absurdity and I love when a horror movie acknowledges it and has a little fun. YOU'RE NEXT is your average run-of-the-mill home invasion slasher film that focuses on a dysfunctional family that, even when Hell breaks loose around them, they can't help but throw the occasional snide remark between siblings. The fun's in the little moments between scares. One of my personal favorites this movie is when one of the women in the house freaks out and makes a break for it out the front door and her husband, with a crossbow bolt embedded in his shoulder, gives chase but cuts it short when the bolt knicks a high tension wire and sends him writing in pain. Nothing fancy but the moment never fails to elicit a laugh from me. The juxtaposition of humor and scares works so well because the jump or cringe-inducing moments are just as effective.The violence in YOU'RE NEXT is pretty brutal at times. It never goes too extreme but there are some bits that'll have the average viewer wincing. There's one kill that I won't ruin here that I never saw coming and it was done incredibly well; there's a nice build-up, you have a little hope for the character, and then BOOM. They're done. The killers, without going into any detail about them for fear of spoiling anything, are well-practiced at what they do. And for the first half of the film, their nothing more than faceless, cold-blooded murderers hidden behind cheap animal masks to hide any and all humanity behind them. I thought the killers in this movie were great and, best of all, human. They make mistakes and they pay for them in ways that Ghostface from SCREAM never did. Sure, Ghostface might take a tumble down some stairs but, if these thugs aren't careful, they'll receive a taste of their own medicine. You see, YOU'RE NEXT doesn't have the average damsel-in-distress protagonist stumbling from scene to scene, narrowly avoiding bloody death while everyone around her is carved to pieces. Our hero here is intelligent and proactive. Plus, she's hot and Australian so, you know, bonus. Sharni Vinson (Erin) is pretty awesome and she never plays up her character's abilities as anything more than an instinctual response to a dangerous situation. The cast as a whole was pretty great. I'm not exactly a horror aficionado so everyone in the film was unfamiliar to me with the exception of Joe Swanberg (eldest brother, Drake) whom I remember from the least entertaining segment from V/H/S. But they all do a (no pun intended) killer job here.I don't really have anything to complain about with YOU'RE NEXT. I'm hesitant to place it amongst my horror favorites because it's still, at its core, your average slasher film. It's just done way, way better than probably 90% of the cheap horror crap we get. So consider this a glowing recommendation for Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett's YOU'RE NEXT. It's consistently entertaining and more than makes up for that horrible ABC'S horror segment where Adam and Simon attempt to kill a duck.",You're Next
68,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Despite a shaky and less-then-compelling first act, ""You're Next"" enjoys a wonderfully tense, amusing and insane second half that makes it a highly enjoyable horror-flick.",7,15 February 2014,"""You're Next"" is one of a number of films I've seen over the past few years that was able to break beyond my expectations, and get better and better as it moved along. During the first half-hour or so, I found myself drifting from the film, almost bored by what I thought was a formulaic, clichéd slasher flick.Thankfully, I stuck with it, and I was very pleased to find that the second half was not only highly enjoyable, tense, amusing and thrilling, but it pretty much also managed to make up for the less-than-stellar first half.Directed by Adam Wingard, ""You're Next"" follows various members of a wealthy family, re-uniting to celebrate the anniversary of parents Aubrey and Paul. Among the various siblings gathering at the scene are son Crispian and his girlfriend Erin, who serve as the primary focus of the film. Once everybody arrives, it seems like a fairly normal get- together, with tensions rising and people trying to get along despite shaky pasts. However, things take a turn for the worse when a group of masked men begin to invade the home and pick off family members one-by- one. Now, Erin is forced into a position of leadership, struggling to organize a defense against these sadistic invaders, all while trying to unravel the mystery of who they are and what their motivation could be- revelations that will shake everyone to the core.The cast is actually pretty compelling. Sharni Vinson in the lead role of Erin is not only beautiful, but very fun and very convincing in her role. She's a great lead presence in the film. A.J. Bowen as Crispian is also a lot of fun, and he gives a decent performance as someone who is obviously troubled and dealing with a lot of familial issues. Other roles, played by the likes of Barbara Crampton, Rob Moran, Nicholas Tucci, Wendy Glenn and Lane Hughs are also quite good, though unfortunately they are overshadowed in the script by the characters of Erin and Crispian, meaning they don't make as much of an impact as one would hope. Still, I can safely say there isn't a single poor performance here, so the cast is actually pretty darned good.The script by Simon Barrett (who also has a small role in the film) is pretty solid. It's well-paced, has a lot of great tension and even some good zany dark humor. My only complaint, as hinted at above, is that it is a bit slow to start. And if feels overly formulaic in the first half. So I could see the film losing some people in it's early scenes, since it doesn't stand out too much. But as I mentioned above, the film also has an exceedingly strong second half, that redeems this. While the opening was overly slow and boring, the second half is just a powerhouse of horror-flick fun.Adam Wingard's direction is also quite strong. I haven't seen too much of his other work, but I thought he came across as a good visual storyteller here. His composition, choice of shots and establishment of mood works great for the most part. Although I could nit-pick a few minor details of his work here and there that I personally found sort-of annoying. But those are only minor complaints in what was otherwise a very solid effort.The rest of the production is a blast. From fun music that almost had a retro-flavor, to some great lighting courtesy the cinematographer, to moody set and costume design. The film works. (Although I was never 100% convinced by the gore effects. Sorry makeup team, but the blood was just a little too... bright and translucent.)All-in-all, I'm glad I gave this film a shot, and I'm glad I stuck with it. It's not the best horror film of all time, but it's a really fun, solid movie. I give ""You're Next"" a pretty good 7 out of 10. I'd say horror/suspense fans should give it a shot.",You're Next
69,rivertam26,fun but shallow,6,29 August 2013,"There's been a lot of positive buzz around this movie and it mostly delivers. It's not the generic slasher film the trailers present it to be, it's a bit more complex. The film centers on a upper class couple celebrating their 35th wedding anniversary who invite their kids and their significant others up for the weekend. But their celebration is cut short when a couple masked weirdos in animal masks crash the bash with cross bows and axes and begin dispatching the guests in gruesomely hilarious ways one by one. There's a lot to like here, the execution by Adam Wingard is clever the family dynamics and the victims reactions are the best parts because their played up for laughs.The film is neither a sort of send up of the material like Cabin in the Woods or a satire like Scream. Which makes it more of a straight forward horror film than both of those which is the films biggest flaw. Because in that way it doesn't really deliver. The film lacks a strong, confident atmosphere instead opting for laughs and fun rather than powerful, nightmarish moments like the strangers and it isn't very ambitious in terms of it's subtext either like The Purge. In fact the film becomes a little to complex midway through and looses any type of scary edge the film may have possessed when revealing the incompetent villains. There's definitely something to be said about leaving more to the imagination.The film lacks the polish of more standard Hollywood fare and sometimes comes across a bit too amateurish. So what we are left with is an entertaining, clever but not overly intelligent horror film that feels a bit hollow. It's certainly not on the same level as this year's horror masterpiece The Conjuring. But surely there is enough promise and entertainment value here to merit a recommendation. That being said I don't think it's necessary for a theater viewing. I feel like it would work just as well on DVD at home with a bunch of drunken friends so you can enjoy all of the funny stuff loudly, intentional or otherwise. All in all it's a fun ride but there's very little you haven't seen before and most of it has been executed better elsewhere. 3/5",You're Next
70,capkronos,Direct-to-DVD mediocrity that went theatrical.,5,25 August 2014,"Though there may be similar movies predating it, the first movie I remember seeing that featured psychos in cheap, creepy plastic animal masks was FORTRESS (1985), an underrated Aussie thriller featuring kidnappers decked out like ""Dabby Duck,"" ""Pussy Cat"" and ""Mac the Mouse"" (as well as ""Father Christmas"") going after a schoolteacher and the students in her charge. That movie scared the hell out of me as a little kid and perhaps left a lasting impression on others because I've seen several films since featuring killers in identical get-ups. This is another one. It's even plausible the filmmakers are attempting to pay direct homage to that earlier film by casting an Australian leading lady in an otherwise very American film, but it's hard to tell. Unlike FORTRESS, which is more of a suspense thriller than an all out horror film, this one mashes up slasher-gore, home invasion flick, mystery and black comedy. The results are extremely uneven.Paul (Rob Moran), a millionaire, now-retired marketing director for a defense contractor, and his wife Aubrey (Barbara Crampton), decide to celebrate their thirty-fifth wedding anniversary by having all four of their children and their spouses / significant others over for a weekend visit. Little do most of them know, but their next-door neighbor down the road (Larry Fessenden in his usual one-scene cameo) and his girlfriend have already been slaughtered by a trio of nuts whose identities are concealed with fox, tiger and lamb masks. While having dinner and emotions are already running high because of some bickering between a few of the brothers, one of the guests is shot through the head with an crossbow arrow through the window. From then on out it's a fight for survival for the rest as the intruders stalk the grounds and some of the family members are (rather predictably) exposed as having ties with the masked killers.Filmed back in early 2011, this somehow managed to garner a belated wide theatrical release (2000+ cinemas) in late 2013. As with nearly all major genre films to come down the pike in the 2000s, a good deal of hype was generated for it by both the distributor and most of the better-known genre websites doing their usual cheerleading routine (considering the latter are little more than paid hype-generating shills posing as unbiased ""genre critics"" I'm surprised *anyone* cares what they have to say). Despite all of that, audiences rejected this one and it was quickly yanked from theaters after grossing only 18 million dollars. It's quite easy to understand why: There's nothing unique, inventive or all that good about this film and it was hardly deserving of ANY ""critical"" attention bestowed upon it. The acting is mostly terrible, the script is abysmal (with a silly, predictable, hole- filled plot and characters doing the most moronic things imaginable to get themselves killed), the picture quality is flat, ugly and murky and the film slavishly relies on loud sound cues, jump cuts and jittery camera- work to provide its ""scares.""Thankfully, there are two elements that keep the film (just barely) watchable. The first is the high amount of splatter. Axes, knives and machetes are sunk into heads, eyes are gouged out with ice picks, a head is literally blended, nails are driven through feet, throats are slashed open and spew blood, etc. The film provides plenty of blood and utilizes old school makeup effects, so it works OK as a brainless gore-fest. The second successful element is lead actress Sharni Vinson, who starts out as your typically sweet, supportive girlfriend type before her survivalist instincts kick in and she transforms into an crotch-kicking, head-bashing bad ass who can take a lick and keep on ticking. Not even a knife through the shoulder, a leap through a second story window, a shard of glass through the leg or a gunshot to the chest can slow this chick down! Though the character isn't the least bit believable, Vinson has fun with the part and is the only even remotely likable person in the movie. I also enjoyed seeing Crampton in her small role, though the filmmakers don't really give her anything to do. The rest of cast - consisting mostly of a clique of filmmakers / actors who frequently work with one another - is awful.If you're gonna see this one, I'd keep expectations low. Aside from the bloodshed and the leading lady, there's nothing special or unique or exceptional about this one. There's zero depth, no atmosphere and it's not the least bit scary, suspenseful, original OR clever. I've seen a lot of the defenders claim this is a comedy, but aside from a few mildly amusing moments, most of the attempts at ""humor"" (""I want to f*** you on this bed next to your dead mom!"") are pretty pathetic.",You're Next

And to be fair, I can totally understand how people come to a higher rating. If you're just expecting an entertaining piece of slasher horror, this one will fully satisfy you. But if you, like me, like horror movies to be a bit more subtle and deliver a story that is actually plausible, you will be disappointed. The fact that the main character can face the killers because she incidentally grew up on a survival farm alone is so dumb that I can barely take the actions serious. The rest is mainly a killing spree including multiple pretty nasty acts of violence.All in all this maybe just wasn't my cup of tea.

75,ASouthernHorrorFan,"My Review Of ""You're Next""",9,18 January 2014,"Adam Wingard directed ""You're Next"" is a modern visceral horror the delivers both the nod to classic genre filmmaking and contemporary storytelling. The film stars Sharni Vinson, Joe Swanberg, AJ Bowen, Nicholas Tucci, Wendy Glenn, Margaret Laney, Ti West, Amy Seimetz, Rob Moran, Barbara Crampton, L.C. Holt, Simon Barrett and Lane Hughes. Yeah I know I named pretty much every one in the film but they all really do deserve a nod because there wasn't a weak character in the film. Plus the characters gave such good death that I have to acknowledge them all. ""You're Next"" stays with a pretty simple scheme of home invasion/violent attack that has become common over the past decade of horror films of this nature. The big difference between this film and a lot of the others is the brilliant blend of 70's/80's nostalgia with a truly 21st century spin.""You're Next"" is about a wealthy family that gathers at a weekend home in the country on the parent's 35th wedding anniversary. Upon the big night when everyone has arrived and sat down to dinner they are attacked by masked assailants with extreme brutality. The story is tight and unwinds smoothly allowing for an intense thrill ride. At first I thought it was going to be one of those slow building horror film's that ends in one twisted, violent displays of violence but ""You're Next"" keeps a pretty chilling, steady pace of non-stop suspense that had me on edge. I have never enjoyed cursing at the people on the screen as I did with this film. I never really noticed any moments where the story became stagnant. Even after the mid-film reveal as to the plot I still found the remaining section of ""You're Next"" just as thrilling as the first half. As for the special effects and soundtrack of ""You're Next"", I found them equally entertaining and quite strong for an indie horror film. The gore and violent action scenes were strong and bloody. I cringed at how the kill sequence would play out and yet I couldn't wait to see it happen. The violence wasn't over-the-top or gratuitous-at least not for my taste. The film actually gave me the same level of pleasure I get from the classic horror films like ""The Burning"" and the original ""I Spit On Your Grave"". The soundtrack plays out with perfect resonance to the films almost somber atmosphere and violent nature. The sound effects created a wonderful homage to the VHS horror days that helped frame ""You're Next"" as a truly nightmarish and modern urban apologue.

While it's chaotic and stupid, the film has a high splatter level and is entertaining enough to keep horror fans talking. This is the perfect over-the-top scary movie to jump start the Halloween season.Wingard seems to have taken a little bit from 'Them' and 'Fortress' to make 'You're Next'. The film takes place in a giant mansion away from city life. When four siblings and their significant others get together to see their parents, little do they know that several psychos in animal masks are watching them and will eventually start killing them one by one.Since there are ten people to kill, Wingard disposes of a few fairly early on. It feels like everyone in this house can only cower, hide in a corner, or scream for long periods of time – that is, everyone except the Australian, Erin (Sharni Vinson), who seems to know how to survive any type of attack. About halfway through the movie, we find out why these people are murdering this family, and that's where the pace picks up and the blood really starts flying. By the end, you'll yell at the characters to do this or do that, and the movie ends with a fun-as-hell moment that will garner a big smile as you walk out of the theater.This is the type of movie where the characters do asinine things that make you think they must want to die. But that's what makes it so fun. The acting, script, and bloodletting are all done to ridiculous levels, and that's the whole point. It's a fast, crude, and highly entertaining horror flick.

When the Davison family comes under attack during their wedding anniversary getaway, the gang of mysterious killers soon learns that one of victims harbors a secret talent for fighting back. There is a real duality to all the characters. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods.

80,ersinkdotcom,Home invasion thriller 'You're Next' expands on horror sub-genre,8,6 January 2014,"I've been excited to see ""You're Next"" ever since reading about it what seems like over a year ago. Sometimes it takes indie genre films a while to find the right distributor and studio that will give it a chance. ""Everybody Loves Mandy Lane"" is an extreme example of the long time it can take for a movie to make it from festival to Blu-ray and DVD release. I can honestly say that the wait for this home invasion/slasher/horror mutation was worth the wait.Crispian (AJ Bowen) and his fiancée, Erin (Sharni Vinson), travel to his family's rural Missouri vacation house to celebrate the anniversary of his mother (Barbara Crampton) and father (Rob Moran). His brothers (Nicholas Tucci and Joe Swanberg) and sister (Amy Seimetz) join them at the secluded mansion for the festivities. As the dysfunctional bunch sit down for a nice dinner, they are brutally attacked by a trio of armed killers. The group must now find a way to survive and fight for their lives as the masked murderers attempt to pick them off one by one.Although ""You're Next"" isn't perfect or the most original film to be released, it does its job as a thriller and slasher piece. There are some nice twists and turns in the plot, even if you see them heading at you. I compare it to riding a roller-coaster for the third time, but still being excited and taken aback when you hit that familiar loop you know is coming.""You're Next"" is rated R for strong bloody violence, language, and some sensuality/nudity. A lot of blood is shed as you would imagine. The nudity is brief and just at the beginning of the film. It's completely unnecessary as usual and adds nothing to the big picture.There's really no message or lesson to be found in ""You're Next."" I guess you can stretch and say it warns not to trust anyone. It might also encourage some to take a survivalist class to learn how to live in the wild and be prepared for anything. Aside from that, it's just a gory and gruesome thrill ride.""You're Next"" will excite fans of home invasion films like ""The Strangers,"" ""Cherry Tree Lane,"" and even ""The Purge."" I consider it to be highly recommendable to genre enthusiasts. One bonus offered by the movie is the chance to see the director of the lame ""The House of the Devil"" flick, Ti West, die a horrible death. That's worth the price of admission alone.",You're Next
81,acidburn-10,A decent watch,8,2 March 2014,"After seeing the trailers for this movie, for quite a while now, I was actually really eager to see this movie, and it's the first mainstream slasher movie that I've been excited about for quite a while and for once, gladly it's not a crappy remake. As soon as I started it I was intrigued and was hooked all the way through. The movie starts off with a double murder, and then we start to meet the family members arriving at an isolated cabin for the parent's anniversary. Okay surprise, surprise you get the typical set up, a house in the middle of nowhere, no phones are all the typical set up we've seen many times before. But that doesn't make this movie in any way bad, in fact I found this movie rather enjoyable, especially when the killers show up, three of them in fact wearing animal masks, which makes the whole ordeal rather frightening and unsettling.There are moments of great shock and great impact, like when the first family member gets knocked off, and the remaining members are left ducking and taking cover, and the death scenes are cool and gruesome, but the only thing that kinda lacks are the characters, as they are written rather thinly and very absent minded, I know okay you gets that in nearly all these types of movies, but in this one, they are especially stupid and mean, for a family unit, it's as if they don't care about each other, like letting their youngest daughter run outside and leaving a family member alone in the bedroom alone to get hacked to pieces, and the way they run off alone is rather unbelievable even for a movie of this kind. But that doesn't make this movie in any way bad, it's all the more fun and the only cast member worth mentioning is Erin played brilliantly by Sharni Vinson takes the final girl role to a whole new and exciting level and also the twist in the plot does explain things rather well and wraps everything up nicely.All in all ""You're next"" is a fun paced slasher, that okay a bit sloppy in places but still packs a punch and with a cool final girl who really makes this movie a decent watch.",You're Next

I spent the first third of the movie just trying to figure out the motives of the killers, nothing made a whole lot of sense, and everything seems very random the way the original Friday the 13th didn't quite go far enough to explaining Michael's motives, or how insane he was until later in the film. However it is worked out, and there is a reason for all of it so I would recommend this one to most action thriller lovers, you will not be disappointed.

However, a potentially fun evening turns into a nightmare when a family member is killed and soon after that they realise they are being hunted. The ruthless killers didn't count on one of the family members fighting back, though, and soon the hunters become the hunted.You're Next was never going to win any awards for originality, but it doesn't set out to be some deep, meaningful movie. It's exactly what it's supposed to be - a good horror/thriller with a couple of decent twists and nothing more.There are some good moments of suspense as well, but nothing to the extent of The Collector, for example, but while it lacks a wee bit in the suspense department, the ""holy crap!"" moments make up for it as there are a few moments that will make you say that or words to that effect anyway.The killings are obviously violent and bloody but the gore isn't over the top which is good as it's sometimes an obvious trend to bump up the gore when the storyline is about as interesting a Kanye West concert.As with any movies of this type, though, there are moments that make you say ""why the hell are you doing that instead of...."", but that doesn't ruin the viewing of the movie which was fine for me. One thing I did find a bit unrealistic was that two of the killers are supposedly ex-forces but...well, you'll just have to watch the movie to see what I mean as I don't want to give anything away.The killers' masks don't really work either because there's nothing scary about lamb, tiger or fox masks. It would have worked better if the masks were of a more sinister nature (without being ridiculous).

85,asda-man,"Straw foxes, tigers and lambs!",9,12 September 2013,"Home invasion. Some people love the sub-genre and some people hate it. Personally, I love it! Possibly my favourite ever horror film, Inside, is built around a home invasion premise. It's full of thought-provoking ideas about what you would do in the situation, because it could well happen to you (you're next right?) they also tend to be full of emotion, tension and thrills. I've been excited for You're Next ever since I heard about it a couple of years ago. I saw a picture of someone in an animal mask holding an axe and I was sold! I then read a glowing review which made me even more excited. All I had to do was await its release, which seemed like a long time. For some reason studios like to shelve amazing horror films like You're Next and The Cabin in the Woods which makes little sense when rubbish like Paranormal 8 seem to be churned out constantly!So you can imagine my excitement when the film was finally released and I was actually sitting in that cinema chair, hoping to see something really extraordinary. Did You're Next disappoint? No it did not. For some reason people keep going on about how You're Next is a rip-off of The Strangers. Little do they know that The Strangers is actually a rip-off of a much better little known French film called, Them (Ils) and the idea of home invasion was most widely explored in 1971 with Straw Dogs. Don't get me wrong, I like The Strangers. It actually scared me when I watched it on my own in the dark, which something I rarely experience. However, the film is quite slow and doesn't particularly have a large replay value. There are much better examples of home invasion in Inside, Funny Games and the underrated remake of Mother's Day. You're Next is also an example of one of the best home invasion movies.You're Next begins with a nice introduction of all our lambs who are about to enter the killing floor. Main focus is given to Erin and her boyfriend, however we do get some nice character building on the others too. It was actually really nice to get some characters for a change. Most slasher films use characters who all look and talk the same, making it hard to identify who just got their head knocked off with an axe. However, here I could identify people, making it easy and fun to follow. Although most of the characters aren't all that likable apart from Erin, but more on her later.Thankfully, the action begins quite early on during a lovely dinner table argument. It's the perfect way to begin really as most slasher films use the stalk-and-slash tactic which means one character walks off from the group, gets killed and the rest of the group think, ""where did he go?"" Which becomes quite dull and monotonous. Here, all the characters are together and all of them know that they are in danger. It's thick, fast and chaotic as the camera shakes and cuts manically, which actually works quite well here as it really shows how chaotic the situation is (don't worry shaky cam haters, shaky cam doesn't make a noticeable return). I must point out that there is some bad acting at this point, which I'm not sure is intentional or not, because it was quite funny seeing such hysterical acting.Some people might be quite worried at this point. Shaky cam, bad acting, unoriginal premise... But please don't worry yourselves, because it's about to get very interesting indeed. I was actually enjoying the film right from the start, so I was very pleased to see the film getting better and better as it progressed. You're Next's greatest strength lies in the pacing. There is not one dull moment. The film miraculously manages to maintain a sense of thrill and tension throughout. The pace is relentless with gratuitous and gracious violence caressing the screen throughout. Gore-lovers might be a bit disappointed as there are only one or two really gruesome kills, however you'll be glad to hear that there are a lot of kills. It's outrageous fun throughout.You're Next also creates one of the best horror heroines in Erin. She's a female Rambo who knows exactly how to survive. Sometimes in films like these, there can be a lot of stupid decisions being made. However, there are none to be made here with Erin around. She's a sassy hero which makes You're Next even more intelligent than it needs to be. Seeing her get revenge on the attackers is amazing fun to watch and it's exactly what you want to happen too! You can tell it has been made with love by people who love the genre. The animal masks are amazing and there are some really great set-pieces such as the flashing camera and the scene where the woman runs to the neighbours house. You're Next is full to the brim with exciting moments making it have a fantastic replay value.I didn't want You're Next to end. It's an incredible offering to the home invasion horror genre, and shows the right way to do horror. II actually think it deserves more love than it gets as it's not often that a horror film comes along that really knows its audience and how to please them. I loved the surprising twists and turns it took (although I am proud to say that I speculated the twist quite early on) and the fun mayhem it produced throughout its running time. You're Next is horror done right. For me it's the best horror film of the year so far, beating The Purge, Evil Dead and The Conjuring. I think You're Next is going to be very hard to beat.",You're Next
86,Rickting,Effective horror which refuses to be boxed in,8,21 December 2014,"2013 was another lame year for horror, but this and The Conjuring showed a standard of horror not often seen in modern times. You're Next is a straight forward home invasion thriller in many ways, but it subverts genre clichés. It's just a group of masked intruders breaking into a family gathering and starting a brutal, bloody rampage but there's a sting in this tale. Packed with unpredictable scare sequences and twists, You're Next should be next on any horror buff's watch list. YN has its scary scenes but its primarily an effective mix of gore and pitch black humour, which makes it more interesting than the typical horror flick. With an excess of the red stuff, a lack of genuine structure and some repetitive stuff, those who don't care for horror films will be more exhausted than entertained and this certainly isn't without flaws, but it has to be admired for its energy and use of humour.It's a well directed movie with a lot of punch and zest, and while it's not emphasizing scares there are suspenseful and frightening moments. I'm not a fan of gore, since it's often tedious and rarely scary, but this uses gore in an effective way and makes the film more intense and stylish. The black humour is very clever as well. What sets the film apart is its gloriously badass heroine, who is one of the coolest horror movie heroines of all time. YN can feel like a bit of a slight movie, but it's got brains and intensity that modern horror lacks and from the start you're drawn in by the normal seeming characters and stylish, gore soaked death scenes. It's quite a nasty film and certainly earns the 18 certificate, but it's a rare example where the gore actually feels stylish and frightening. Gripping, gory and deliriously unrestrained, YN is should definitely be watched over: The Ring, The Devil Inside, The Wicker Man (2006), Paranormal Activity or 90% of 21st century horror films.8/10",You're Next
87,RevRonster,Not bad but still felt too familiar to stand out for me...,6,18 January 2014,"Would ya look at that? Another movie about people in creepy masks attacking ridiculously isolated people.The story of ""You're Next"" feels overwhelmingly familiar, however, even with strong visuals, great tension-filled music and even a few decent scares here and there, I couldn't help but feel the film would have been better as a short film. Even the acting, which comes off as passable or ignore-worthy, feels like it is putting in about as much effort as the story when it concerns standing out. Overall, the film just felt like it was okay with just being another one of ""those films."" The film wastes no time getting going, and that's a good thing, but viciously underdeveloped characters and a story that, honest, didn't feel like it had much going for it, ended up making me bored before the film hit its hour mark. Even all the terrific gore that the film throws at you wasn't enough to help me overlook the incredibly cheesy (and terribly obvious) twist the film throws at you about why the killers are attacking the family.""You're Next"" (or, as many on internet will spell it; ""Your Next"") does some things right to earn its place in the horror/thriller genre.

And if you read the words YOU'RE NEXT in blood red paint, it should be taken literallyThe Davison family has a lot of money, class, and problems. But without giving too much away, it can be said there's finally a horror flick, within a slew of mediocre entries, that realizes, through dark comedy and ultra-violence, the audience is full aware that the ""haunted house,"" or in this case, ""invaded house"" genre has been done nearly to death. In other words, all the clichés seem intentional... And when one of the characters begins fighting back with surprising resilience against a group of mask-wearing antagonists, we finally have a woman – there's a spoiler for ya – well worth rooting for.Sharni Vinson plays Erin, the soft-spoken, unassuming girlfriend of Crispian, one of three eclectic sons of Rob Morgan's Paul Davison, retired with the busman's chore of fixing-up his very large house. But relaxation ends when, during a wine-sipping dinner party with mom, dad, sister, three brothers and their women, a horde of crossbows are shot inside the living room.From this shaky-cam barrage the film catapults into a more punctuating and personal body-count horror flick where the sole survivor, instead of running frantically like your typical scream queen victim, uses various weapons and traps, and, unlike those heartless villains, she winds up having most of the bloody fun, for a change That alone makes YOU'RE NEXT worth watching.",You're Next
89,lathe-of-heaven,"Gripping and Suspenseful, but perhaps a BIT more style and atmosphere would have given it some depth...",6,2 February 2014,"Overall I feel that the film was entertaining and the Suspense was very well done; It's extremely gripping and maintains a very tense atmosphere.I do agree though with a couple of the other reviewers who mentioned that the 'Dramatic' scenes with the family members leading up to where the action starts, especially the dialog, leave a lot to be desired. Very poor, I would say. However, clearly once the action kicks into high gear, it never EVER lets up!I personally do NOT go in for gratuitous brutal violence when it is realistically based (as opposed to what I call 'Monster Violence', for example in films like 'REANIMATOR' & 'FROM BEYOND' where it is more Fantasy based) So, for me personally, I would not have extended a few of the kills like the director did; I mean, once you stab a person or bludgeon them with a log or brick, I feel it is TOTALLY pointless to have the person just keep on stabbing / pounding them incessantly. To me it detracts from the true emotional impact and just panders to the baser cruelty and violence that some people somehow 'enjoy'... However, I am trying NOT to allow that personal preference to affect my overall impression and judgment as far as whether I feel that this is a well made film or not. For example, for what it's worth, I thought the last 15 minutes and the last few kills involved were FAR more creative and entertaining then just mindlessly pounding someone's head with a rock relentlessly until what is left is not even recognizably human any more. Just my opinion...Those preferences and the poor dialog / acting in the beginning aside, I think that the rest of the movie played out quite well and definitely held the audience firmly in it's suspenseful grasp.Again though, as I mention in my Summary above, rather than just the straight-forward, brutish way the story was handled / directed, I personally feel that a bit more of a creative or stylish touch would have really increased the overall impact and entertainment value of the film.For example and for my taste, a very similar film but one that I found FAR more clever and enjoyable, if perhaps not quite as chilling and suspenseful, was the much more entertaining 'THE AGGRESSION SCALE'. There you had a more clever approach, a HELL of a lot more subtlety, characters who were a LOT more interesting, and WAAAAAAAAAY more enjoyable and entertaining actors. Not to mention, FAR more creative kills. Otherwise with this film what you are left with and what you have ultimately is a very violent and brutal 'Home Invasion' type film, but with a better than average premise...",You're Next

91,rooee,Welcome to the house of dumb,3,13 September 2013,"Remember, halfway through Cabin in the Woods, how it went completely off the rails in the most delirious way possible? That was bold. Expect no such curveballs from You're Next. This basic, cheapo slasher has taken two years to reach the silver screen, although it's not clear how it ever made the step up from DVD - it has Kim Newman's Video Dungeon written all over it.The story concerns a reunion of the Davison siblings at their wealthy parents' country home. Tensions bubble under the surface during some sporadically engaging early scenes. Then the family start getting picked off by crossbow snipers. Soon the killers are in the house, taking out family members one by one as they inexplicably go exploring rooms on their own.There will be blood; there will be predictable twists; there will be a dearth of surprises.A lack of innovation wasn't a problem for recent horror hit The Conjuring, but then that movie was propelled by skillful performances, the subtle building of tension, a fine script, plausible character motivations, elegant direction and editing, and some imaginative scary encounters. You're Next has none of these things.Does it have anything going for it? The presence of a strong female protagonist is always welcome – if Sharni Vinson is a scream queen, then she's not the one doing the screaming. Also, the film's score is distinctive, starting with dark, searing drones and slipping into some late rolling synth. But it isn't enough to make up for all that's risible.Truly, the dialogue scenes had my auditorium sniggering. Later, when the blood starts flowing throughout the repetitive fight scenes, sniggers became full laughter. And yet there is no evidence of archness or knowingness on writer-director Adam Wingard's part. If this is a parody then I never felt like I was in on the joke.

For the standards I would set for a film to make such a statement, this film falls short. If the filmmakers had an intent to find dark humour, it was not stressed anywhere except in the final scene. That does not make this a dark humour film. Same for the supposedly creative use of gore, throat slitting and ax murdering is not new. The crossbows and creepy masks used by the unknown gang of killers could also have been shot and presented a lot creepier (such as they appear on the movie poster). The script and performances were uneven, the story trying to handle how a large group of people would react to home invaders.The story decides to put all it's marbles in one basket with the only smartly written character played by Sharni Vinson. In fact the film deliberately hides the fact that this ensemble film is really about her character. Frankly, the empty-headed family she joins at their remote mansion seem to be there just for building up the body count. For the accolades I had heard about this film, I was disappointed at how little the potential for a more creepy and stylish production wasn't explored. Supposedly, a couple twists are supposed to surprise us, but not me. It did help the dynamic in the third act in guessing who could be trusted, but again not to the potential. So with only run-of-the-mill story telling, generic direction, and just OK scares, this film underwhelmed. Too bad Sharni Vinson was the only thing worth watching.

When the wealthy patriarch invites his mostly ungrateful children and their significant others to a family reunion, men in animal masks attack the house and while the family proves basically useless in this situation, one woman won't go down without a bloody good fight. This is a slickly produced low budget genre entry that remarkably keeps the tone, suspense and laughs consistent throughout. The synth score is a welcome addition to this gory fun and while none of the actors have the juiciest of roles to play with here, they are all more than competent. While plenty of these types of films that rely on a twist to reveal the identity of the killer or killers, fall into expository hell when the twist is revealed - You're Next never falls into those clichés and avoids any narrative hiccups - the twist is revealed, yet the mayhem and comedy continue undeterred.

You can see that the film was made by people with little experience. Some of the cast did well, only others can not really act. You also do not understand the actions of the family members and there are some mistakes is the story that sometimes do not make sense. In a horror movie, fortunately it does not matter, because you know that most people will be murdered anyway. I was most annoyed by the mother. Fortunately, the protagonist was good. She had the better ideas to protect herself and the rest against the murderers. The only thing that keeps you interested in the film is why the family is attacked.
The first half of the film was more of the horror part with lots of jump scares. Most jump scares you see coming and when you have seen the trailer you know when they are about to come.
The second half of the film was less scary and had more humor. There were also some twists in the second half, but even those you see arrive just in advance. If the reason for the murderers is made known, you can watch a battle between the protagonist and the murderers.
You're Next will not be such a big success. If you like horror movies, the movie can be entertaining.",You're Next
98,ExpendableMan,Could you just die already? This is really hard for me,9,14 October 2014,"On first inspection, You're Next seems to be another run of the mill home invasion horror movie. Like The Strangers and The Purge, it features a family under siege by a gang of masked killers and involves a lot of awkward, mumbled dialogue. Windows start getting smashed, characters root around in drawers for kitchen knives and murderers lurk beneath beds, waiting to emerge at just the right moment...And yet despite the overly familiar set up, You're Next is brilliant. In fact it's one of the most deliriously enjoyable horror films I've seen in ages. After one blood drenched introduction, the film is relatively sedate for the first half hour. Mr and Mrs Davison arrive at their large country house for an anniversary party with their adult children, three of whom have brought their wives and girlfriends along. Old sibling rivalries resurface and just when the big family dinner couldn't get any worse, somebody shoots a crossbow bolt into Ti West's head. From there, You're Next ramps up the carnage and things escalate quickly. I mean they really get out of hand fast. Throats get sliced with piano wire, axes are swung into heads and some people seem to need an awful lot of stabbing before they actually die. Undercutting it all is a razor sharp and witty script. It's gut wrenchingly violent and utterly horrific, but it's also remarkably funny and the dialogue is terrific. This is horror written by people who know the genre inside out and love it as well. It's an intelligent and subversive film, but at no point is it condescending. It starts off looking like a serious drama, where relationship dynamics are put under the microscope and exposed to the world, but by the end of it the walls are splattered and a guy has been blended to death. You're Next is brilliant fun and hard as nails Aussie lead Sharni Vinson might just be the toughest Final Girl in horror history.",You're Next

Apparently I am not alone in that thought, as this film has made a paltry 17M. Box office mojo does not list the budget, which tells me it's more than 17M.

Yes, it's been overdone of course, but the best part of You're Next is that it doesn't take itself seriously in the very least. The actors are bad, the violence is gory and the story is preposterous...which makes for a fun theater experience. The film will certainly garner its fair share of hate from people expecting another Conjuring or Strangers, but what sets You're Next apart from those films is its sense of humor. The characters are written as douche bags, the villains are written as hybrid Jason Vorhees knock offs and the kills are nothing original but just good gory fun.

105,ghost_dog86,When the best part of the movie is the soundtrack,6,28 August 2013,"You gotta appreciate killers who value spelling and punctuation. ""You're Next"" is the new home invasion horror flick, which reunites independent genre filmmakers Adam Wingard (director) and Simon Barrett (writer). But therein lies the reason why this both succeeds and fails in the same 94 minute breath.Side Note: Before I bring this movie down to earth, I will say that not since ""Insidious"" used Tiny Tim's ""Tiptoe Through The Tulips"", have I witnessed a better usage of a particular song in a horror movie. Furthermore, the sequences where it is used not only (coincidentally) display the best direction, but are the most memorable as well. The song in question is ""Looking For the Magic"" by the Dwight Twilley Band, and it's the best part of this movie.Synopsis: A bunch of people in a remote cabin (just trying to have a good time) are viciously terrorized by masked killers, for reasons unknown. But what these masked killers don't realize, is that one of the victims ""has a very particular set of skills."" Skills acquired over a very long time. Skills that are bound to make said victim a nightmare for (you guessed it) masked killers. If all of this sounds familiar, that isn't a surprise. Wingard and Barrett are not trying to reinvent the wheel here. All they are trying to do is put their spin on the rated R slasher. And if it's scary, then nothing else matters, right? Often during some of the more gruesome sequences, Barrett curiously attempts to display his own dark sense of humor, by having someone in the group say something witty or engage in some obscenely awkward commentary. But by doing so, he absolutely mutilates the horror atmosphere during these moments and causes character reactions to MURDER, to come off as confusing at best. Not to mention, that nearly all of the ""funny lines"" fall flat because they are so quirkily misplaced.That said, the direction is really what makes and breaks ""You're Next"". It is rare that you get examples of some excellent horror direction and some downright awful direction in the same film. But that's what you get here. On one hand, any director that can make guys wearing stupid animal masks look intimidating is doing something right. On the other hand, there are scenes (mostly when nobody is getting killed or screaming their heads off) that are so tedious and eye rollingly laughable, they will take the viewer out of the horror experience all together. Not to mention, a kill that is literally unwatchable, not for its grotesqueness, but because the screen is just too damn bright to look at during said sequence. So, this aspect in particular was a little disappointing; especially since I did predict (not too long ago) that Wingard would be the next big thing in horror.Final Thought: While ""You're Next"" does deliver some suspense and scares (all of which are the ""quiet, quiet, quietLOUD, LOUD, LOUD"" types of scares) the main problem with this as a horror movie, is that it doesn't hold any weight. That is to say, it's not all that creepy, it's not going to be something that is going to keep you up at night and it's not even that realistic as far as home invasion movies go. That is not to say that overall ""You're Next"" doesn't succeed at being a watchable and somewhat refreshing gruesome horror (next to the putrid gore-fest/torture-porn of the past decade). It just wasn't as refreshing as it needed to be, especially if you are like me and had been anticipating this Wingard/Barrett collaboration ever since the film short ""Q Is for Quack"".",You're Next

107,nesfilmreviews,Unquestionably a cut above the slasher norm.,6,22 August 2013,"What ""You're Next"" lacks in originality in regards to its premise, makes up for it with an infectious energy to satisfy rabid horror fans, while also remaining appealing to mainstream audiences. The movie possesses an entertaining quality laced with a sense of dark humor which invigorates this rather generic, underwhelming storyline. Director Adam Wingard and Screenwriter Simon Barrett's previous collaboration ""A Horrible way to Die"" (2010), displayed great potential and promise. ""You're Next"" is unquestionably the duo's crowning achievement to date.The story begins with married couple (Barbara Crampton and Rob Moran) celebrating their 35th anniversary with their four grown children, and the children's significant others. It's been awhile since the entire family was together, and it doesn't take long for old rivalries to emerge. Crispian (AJ Bowen), is a college instructor who is currently dating Erin (Sharni Vinson). His brother Drake (Joe Swanberg) is the quintessential jerk with his wife (Margaret Laney). Their sister, Aimee (Amy Seimetz), has a pretentious filmmaker boyfriend (Ti West), who's an easy target for dinner-table mockery. The youngest sibling, Felix (Nicholas Tucci), is a screw-up with a gloomy girlfriend (Wendy Glenn). Obviously, the reunion doesn't go according to plan. Tempers flare during family dinner, but the feuding quickly comes to a halt when an unseen killer strikes a fatal blow. They now realize that the house is now surrounded by homicidal strangers wearing masks, who appear determined on leaving no survivors.Once Barrett's wicked script kicks into gear after the first 30 minutes, the cast is slowly and gruesomely eliminated to the bare essentials. The violence is visceral and bloody, but so tongue-in-cheek, it often causes a devilish smile accompanied with some nervous laughter. The movie successfully blends horror with some humor, and employs some twists to subvert the typical, predictable cat and mouse games. The gruesome sequences go a long way towards perpetuating the movie's increasingly forbidding vibe, though there's little doubt that ""You're Next"" fares best once the tables have turned. Undoubtedly, the breakout star of ""You're Next"" is the Australian leading lady Sharni Vinson, who comes across as equally strong and smart in an impressive performance.Wingard and Barrett have fun with the premise with satisfying results, integrating the personal relationships and family conflicts that feed into the developing terror, while having fun playing with audience expectations. The tense atmosphere accompanied with the infectious energy it exudes makes it enjoyable, and easier to gloss over its shortcomings. ""You're Next"" is light on psychological and narrative complexity, but it's unquestionably a cut above the slasher norm. The movie had its world premiere at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival.",You're Next

Plot has an original tone to it with a rich family reunion, together in the deep woods, cue killer(s) starting taking them out one by one. It would have been MORE exciting if the group was outside rather than routinely taken out in the house. The music score was weak in trying to relate to the film being a horror show. We really don't even get a chance to see ANY character development. There were a few key elements that DID rise for a higher rating, such as one of the guests had a few surprises in store for the killers, there was also a twist or two that many will not see coming.

The third and final act of the film is makes this film so amazing,it really switched gears it changed up the entire film completely,it started to tribute retro 80's horror down to a tea. Although the first two acts where fell pretty much right in the middle,there were jokes that were suppose to be funny but weren't. For some of the characters the acting is truly appalling and I couldn't get into it for a large portion of the movie. I defiantly saw the ending coming it was like Oh well this going to happen. It wasn't really that surprising it was pretty predictable. The first two acts of the movie were just run of the middle straight home invasion,theirs guys outside there going to break in and kill people in various brutal ways. It's when the final act starts and this awesome chick who kind of suddenly rose as the leading character very much in the vain of the film Alien where you show an entire group of people getting killed and Sigourney Weaver is like you know screw it I'm killing these aliens.Her character is what made the last half hour of this movie incredibly great and the kills she performed on the guys in animal masks is awesome. I actually hyped this movie up for myself safe to say I shouldn't have done that. It's an OK horror film with a kind of rocky start and a a kind of rocky middle and an incredible ending.

112,rgblakey,There are some uninvited guests coming to this dinner party in You're Next,7,23 August 2013,"The horror genre has continued to struggle over the years with only a few really standing out. For the most part they seem to be just rehashing the same stories or remaking stuff left and right as opposed to delivering something original. The latest You're Next has been sitting on the shelf for a couple of years, but is finally getting it's chance to slash its way onto the big screen, but does it live up to the wait and all the hype it received when originally screened at the film festivals? You're Next follows a family getting together for the first time in a long while, but the struggling family event is cut short when a gang of masked ax and crossbow-wielding murderers descend upon them, but as they fight to stay alive against these ruthless killer they soon realize one of their guests proves to be the most talented killer of all. This is easily one of the best horror slasher types flicks to come along in some time. Sure there are some weak performances here and there, but nothing that hinders the overall film. The story is paced well and actually takes some time to let you get to know the characters a bit without ever thrusting too much unnecessary information. The first bit of the film does move a bit slow, but it helps to set the tone of things to come and when they start it's a bloody home run. There are some great gore moments and creative fun kills that are sure to not only please the usual gore hounds, but also use the slow build to the more entertaining ones as the film progresses. The film works perfectly making sure to build the tension slowly and speeding things up when needed. They have crafted a brilliant score here that has a 70s horror vibe that sets the tone for every seen and making them that much more effective. For these movies you always have to have a great memorable killer and while they kept it simple, those animal masks are effective and creepy creating a great tone to their presence.This is an excellent addition to the horror genre that not only follows all of the old school horror rules, but also just gives you the feel of those same films with its execution. There are a few predictable moments later in the film, but they still manage to deliver that fun you are looking for. Sure if this one is successful there is no doubt someone will try to figure out a way to make another, but this one leaves itself with somewhat of an ending that hopefully they will let it just end on the brilliantly gory and fun high note that it is. In addition the during credits sequence showcasing the actors from the film is pretty damn awesome as well.",You're Next

They're the REAL victims.",1,24 September 2015,"Add ""Evil Dead"", ""The Purge"", ""Scream"" and ""Home Alone"", subtract the fun, and you have the new horror comedy ""You're Next"" (R, 1:34). Yes, horror movies can be fun and although some may disagree, seeing people meet a gruesome end on screen can be entertaining – as a means to an end, as in, in support of an interesting story with a point. Someone should've told these things to the writer, director and actors in this horrible excuse for a horror flick.A cast of mostly unknown actors forms a family who gather at a cabin in the woods to celebrate the 35th wedding anniversary of their well-to-do parents. The couple's adult children all bring their significant others, allowing for a potentially higher body count when the mayhem begins. Once all the victims, er, ah.family members and guests have gathered around the dinner table, someone starts shooting arrows through the windows. It's not long before those someones enter the home, carrying various sharp objects. As the occupants of the house begin to spill their blood, the carnage is played for laughs. The problem is that the deaths and the circumstances surrounding them aren't even remotely funny, nor are the ridiculous things that the others say and do in response.For a long while, the killings seem random. Then, when the reason for this bloodbath is revealed, it just seems like so much overkill (pun intended). The movie is not funny. It's just gruesome. And it crosses the line from tasteless to downright sick when one character suggests that it would be fun if her boyfriend had sex with her next to the body of a family member who was just killed in bed. If that shocks you, all I can say is that I wish I were making this stuff up. I'm not. And no one else should have either.""You're Next"" should refer to the people unfortunate enough to sit down to watch it. They're the REAL victims. I happen to think life is precious and if a filmmaker chooses to show gruesome deaths, those scenes should be portrayed with the respect that such a painful end to someone's life deserves.

114,TuesdayThe17th,Brings back memories of the simpler days,10,27 July 2020,"During a time where styles were changing, plaidd was in, and the days seemed to go on forever, there was mumblecore. 2004-2013 was a good time. The best year of my life yet was probably 2009. A handful of young, motivated, mumblecore indie directors took to the set and created indie horror magic. Adam Wingard, Ti West, Joe Swanberg, Amy Seimetz, Kate Lynn Sheil, the Duplass brothers, etc were nothing short of inspiring to an aspiring filmmaker. These directors films were flooding the indie scene. It wasn't until ""You're Next"" that the genre really broke the flood gates and seeped into mainstream with a very special thanks to Adam Wingard. Watching the bonus features on Wingard's first feature, ""Homesick"" of Adam clearly excited as well as intoxicated, acting out the scenes of his movie with hyper enthusiasm was mind melting. I can sit and watch him talk movies for days. To now look at what Wingard has gone onto is possibly one of the best recent success stories in film. Propelling his career with ""You' re Next"", Adam is now getting ready to release the ever anticipated ""Godzilla Vs. Kong"". His biggest budget film(by far) to date. However, as far as indie horror, You're Next is just what the doctor ordered. We have a group of friends and family that we wish we were a part of, all played by known indie directors and actors. This movie threw several faces into the spotlight, one being one of my favorite indie actors of the time, AJ Bowen. ""You're Next"" is bloody, unflinching, smart, and just plain cool. The dark wooded palette and tones worked hand in hand with the mood of those of us that truly know what good horror is, as well as Rob Moran's wet, wavy, slicked back black hair. Sharni Vinson shines bright in this movie, and was also nice to look at. There is nothing better than a group of good friends creating art together for the whole world to see. There is nothing quite like a good horror movie. Some of us have ideas. Images. Feelings, that we want to have seen by many. These are some of the best upcoming filmmakers; the passionate ones. Passion may not light the fire but it will keep it burning. I watch this movie once a year and will always love it as it acts as a bit of a memory piece for me.

116,blakiepeterson,An Inventive Slasher In A Sea Of Sequels,7,2 May 2015,"What sounds more torturous — going to a dinner party where you despise every single guest, or being the sole survivor of a wretched Friday the 13th sequel? What if I gave you no option? What if I told you you had to live through both, in one sitting? In all fairness, I should not have made such a proposition in the first place, as you're the fortunate one: the characters in You're Next are the poor souls that have to endure such a bloody, miserable experience, while you, pampered on your couch, get to watch them survive (or die), with a laugh, a gag, or a scream. Take your pick. Choose wisely.You're Next is probably the best ""smart"" horror movie since the Scream franchise; it's intelligent not because it's meta or because it's sarcastically aware of itself, but because everything seems to somehow, I don't know, play it straight and have fun with itself, all at the same time. Don't get me wrong, this is a scary film, dressed to the nines with demented killers in animal masks and sickening gore effects. But just because a film is nasty, rude, and not for the squeamish doesn't mean that it can't also be a bloodstained riot. Like The Cabin in the Woods or yes, even Scream, it takes familiar horror territory, looks it straight in the eye, and snarls that it's going to do it better this time around. The home invasion slasher has never been this gratifying.The Davison family, dysfunctional as they are, are planning a reunion for the 35th anniversary of the parents, Paul (Rob Moran) and Aubrey (Barbara Crampton). To smother early symptoms of a midlife crisis, Paul purchases a fixer-upper mansion in rural Missouri, hoping to use it as a vacation home later on. For now, though, it will act as the meeting place for their anniversary weekend. Arriving are Paul and Aubrey's four kids, Crispian (AJ Bowen), Felix (Nicholas Tucci), Drake (Joe Swanberg) and Aimee (Amy Seimetz), and their significant others, Erin (a terrific, show-stopping, whoisthislady? Sharni Vinson), Zee (Wendy Glenn), Kelly (Margaret Laney), and Tariq (Ti West).It only takes moments to realize just how much everyone dislikes each other; none of the siblings get along, and it seems their parents like to play favorites (but even then ). Their romantic interests are just as hostile — it's a dinner party from hell. Luis Buñuel would smile at their discomfort. The violent tension is broken, however, when an arrow flies through the window, hitting and killing Tariq before he can even become a stock character. Before anyone can regroup, more and more shots are fired, with a clear intent of slaughter. And no, the predator isn't a dazed Katniss wandering around middle-of-nowhere Missouri. It seems that not only one, but three next generation Freddie/Jason/Michaels are out to get, and exterminate, the Davison clan. Of course, everyone starts reacting like they've never seen Halloween before, getting picked off like those foolish kids in the original Friday the 13th — but Erin, with her Australian swagger and brunette comeliness, turns out to be a Jamie Lee Curtis on steroids, keeping up with the assassins and one- upping them in the deadliest ways possible. Nothing, though, is quite what it seems to be.You're Next, without a doubt, is an above average horror movie, easy competition in a sad era of reboots and sequels and 3D catastrophes and independent slow burns (sorry, The Innkeepers!). But even if it was the 1970s, You're Next would still be something of a wonder, daring The Stepfather and Fright Night to an arm wrestling match, hardly struggle, and win, without a drop of sweat. It works as a thriller, a horror, and a super black comedy (a really, really black one), beginning as a ball of bloody energy and ending as a ball of bloody energy. Our terror is never really put on hold — it's obvious that some double-crossing is going on, but who is behind all of it?Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett, also behind last year's excellent The Guest, are a filmmaking team ready to become the Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger of horror. Their staging is so precise and so well- conceived that it's a wonder to think that they are still so young (Wingard was 29 when he directed You're Next in 2011) — their presence is remarkably there, in the way we could feel De Palma's pulse throughout Sisters or Carpenter's smarminess in Halloween. Like early Tarantino, there's a gut feeling that Wingard and Barrett, together or otherwise, will be going places, whether those places be more great works of independent horror or big-budgeted fantasy.As much as I enjoyed You're Next, however, my prudish inner self was much more apprehensive. While the dialogue simmers with comic mockery and the actors have killer chemistry, the violence, as graphic as it is, takes away much of the fun to be had. I've never been a gore hound, after all, finding much of Mario Bava's work to be too over-the-top and viewing Lucio Fulci as a guy who needs to calm down. The violence in You're Next is so shockingly brutal (the kill scenes, though often clever, are too sadistic for my taste) that it's easy to go from entertained to disgusted within the blink of an eye. And this is coming from the guy who considers Kill Bill Vol. 1 (and its sequel) to be one of the greatest achievements in film. But just because I haven't lost my sensitivity to on screen carnage over the years doesn't mean that you won't admire You're Next's no-holds-barred approach to the slasher genre.",You're Next

Is that interesting? is that original? I don't think so... If only the kills were original or even ""fun"", and we see some good gore while a bunch of moronic cowards get murdered it may make a good excuse, but this is getting boring.

118,daggersineyes,How on earth did this get a 7 rating?,6,12 September 2013,"Honestly!! I'm pretty forgiving of the ""slasher"" genre and don't expect too much from it. I don't necessarily mind unknown actors who aren't the best, cheesy dialog, plot holes, fake looking blood/violence or terrible music scores. I don't even mind thin plots or lousy character development. But I DO need to see something - ANYTHING - in the movie that makes it worth while. Otherwise, what is the point of watching?But when a movie comes along trying to be a serious horror flick and it has ALL of the above faults & possibly more, I draw the line. Nothing at all in this movie is good. It has terrible scripting, acting is appalling (apart from the Aussie girl who was actually doing her very best to save this with some OK but not brilliant acting - a futile effort) and the direction is amateurish. It felt like something a first year college student would do for their class project and then get ripped apart by a room full of fellow students as they collapsed in giggles at how bad it was. The ""shaky hand-held camera shtick"" has been done to death and to be honest was never a clever idea in the first place. But if you're going to use it you MUST know what you're doing and know how to do everything else so well that the shaky camera view doesn't just become irritating, hard to follow and pointless. Directing and shooting a horror flick takes more than just having your actors run around screaming idiotically while you haphazardly wave a dodgy handy-cam in their general direction and hope you get something interesting actually in the frame. It needs more than some irritating characters who's only real 'character development' is to have them bickering & yelling badly scripted insults across each other, over some trivial lame disagreement during dinner. They need to be interesting characters, the audience need to have something to invest in them, even if it's only because they're sexy/attractive and/or likable and/or funny - which none of these people were. At times it felt as though the cast weren't even given a script but were told to make it up as they go along. That's fine for some shoe- string short film made by amateurs for youtube but it's ridiculous for a movie like this.It does get better in the second half and I think the reason people are scoring it so highly is all down to the one character and actor who makes this dross just that little bit better. My advice, skip the first half, all you need to know is the family are coming to mum and dad's house for their anniversary and they argue a lot. Then the second half is just fun and mayhem.I haven't seen the Korean original - I had no idea this was remake when I watched it, but I might track it down just to see what the movie was supposed to be like. There are many movies out there with the same theme that are done so much better than this. Even the not-so-good ones are more worthy of your time and money. PS just noticed this is also billed as a ""comedy"" - Perhaps the whole movie is badly sending itself up and I just missed the point LOL",You're Next

I just watch it, and it is similar, but I still would rather see a American film than that one any day. That other one was boring as all get. To Sir with Love is about a Teacher not a Family being home invaded like this movie. A student that attacks her and other students. Not even the same thing. Jeez, rip off? Some people are dumb. One mask as a bunny rabbit and there were two or three with masks on this movie. Come on. Making excuses to tear this movie down is lame. At least something was happening more in this movie than the older Korean one. Oh well, it is your prerogative.Audition movie was boring and terrible too. It dragged until the end and all you saw was a limb get cut off, and people called that a really gory movie? That may have been Japanese, but come on. Dang, it was like watching a PG-13 movie.

I would appreciate if the other horror movie filmmakers in the US see this movie and learn something. Good horror movie camera work, very good character development and excellent soundtrack! I dare to say that this is finally one solid horror movie coming out from Hollywood film factory after awhile. However, the movie still faces some problems. The greatest once are deep holes in scenario. I am not sure how to put it without using spoilers, so lets try this way: if you know that the killer is in your house you are not walking around like in the supermarket. If you just find a dead body in one of your bedrooms and you don't leave that place along with everyone else but staying in like - maybe the killer is going to come back and kill me as well, then you have a great gap in your story, I think. What bother's me about this movie is weak slasher approach of the murders in some of the crucial scenes. The director emphasized the 80's style flying knife and ax to the scull rather than just using the moment of surprise or tent dramatic phases. I believe that what scare people is what they don't see , more than what they see. I reckon that blood and broken sculls are more gross but not scary. All in all, it was an enjoyable movie.

Even though the film has buckets of blood and gore, it was not the centerpiece of the movie, like all too often many cheap horror films have as their focus these days.

130,FilmMuscle,An Interesting Premise Hurt By Predictability and Poor Acting,6,26 August 2013,"Every horror film I see nowadays is out of sheer hope that maybe this one will finally revitalize the genre and help it gain more credibility, which it desperately needs at this point. July's The Conjuring, even if it received high acclaim, disappointed me with its clichéd nature, which the genre is basically now known for. There are countless brilliant ideas forming throughout numerous genres except for the horror genre, which consistently releases either haunted-house or slasher flicks, and none of them are made any differently. The Conjuring, while well-made, was considerably forgettable since its story has been done too many times every year. I digress, though, as You're Next promises something new -a home invasion flick- but nonetheless, something new. After this movie's surprising amount of positive reviews, I thought, perhaps, I should check this one out as well and see if I'll finally discover a great, modern horror story. First of all, You're Next essentially transpires during a significant occasion. A wife and a husband are having their exciting anniversary, and they've invited their children to visit them for the special event along with their spouses. What occurs thereafter is a shocking and terrifying interference by a bunch of guys, dressed in freaky masks. It's a home invasion- you get the gist. Anyways, the film commences fairly interestingly with the occasion beginning with a dinner in which the family converses with one another, prompting engaging dialogue that fleshes out the characters to the point where you're able to tell a few of them apart. Usually, these kinds of movies immediately delve into the action where a bunch of generic teenagers goof off and suddenly find themselves before a killer. Now, we finally have middle-aged characters in a horror story -thank god- which already creates a more original atmosphere. Furthermore, throughout the plot's advancement, the audience are witnesses to fascinating and clever camera shots that either further build tension or simply provide more entertainment for the viewers. One thing that also has to be said is that there are quite a bit of comedic areas during the movie, and in a way, You're Next could function as a dark comedy, as well, in the way that The Cabin in the Woods did except not nearly as comedic. In addition, the film gets incredibly tense during the last half as you dearly hope the characters reach safety. With the combination of interesting music choices, smart camera work, and suspenseful room set-ups, the tension only graduates until all has been concluded. With that being said, although there are several satisfying twists throughout this wild ride, the end was unquestionably predictable, and some plot decisions unwisely contributed to such predictability with time lapses being a noticeable one. In addition, some of the character deaths are utterly predictable as well with the way that they're set up. ""Hmmm, I wonder what's going to happen when someone has their back turned to an area where a foe was standing only seconds ago while talking to other characters."" The film desperately sought shock during these moments, but they unfortunately failed. Also, during the tense sequences where windows are breaking or floors creaking, the actors behave overdramatically. That might be strange to claim during such bloodcurdling events, but unconvincingly screaming ""Oh my god, oh my god!"" a dozen times felt like too much. In fact, the acting wasn't anything substantial. The main character, Erin (played by Sharni Vinson), delivered a decent performance, but everyone else was evidently bland with a portion of the characters not even needing to show emotion. By the way, this is a good time to point out that even though I appreciated the dinner scene where certain individuals were recognizably fleshed out, there were still a high number of characters who were left unrevealed, which gave them this role of acting as a prop for when they're finally murdered and rid of. Moreover, a crucial element of a horror flick is its blood and gore, right? Or, at least, most of them in this day and age for that matter. Well, the blood shown in You're Next appears astonishingly fake with the color being unusually bright- too bright- and overly liquid-like where it's obvious it was squeezed out of a blood pack. In the end, You're Next isn't that one film that could've revitalized the genre and restored my faith in its potential quality. The movie introduces a somewhat compelling premise but is ultimately hurt by its predictability and unrealistic look (acting and blood being two factors). I recommend skipping this one, but if you're a true fan of ""slasher"" tales, this one could add a little bit of new flavor to it with its light comedy and inviting premise.",You're Next

But after a while there actually is a semi decent story behind the slashing.Unfortunately, it still suffers from a lot of plot holes and sloppiness. For example, after being shot by arrows through the windows, most normal people would hide behind something and or close the curtain or turn off the lights, but the people in this movie's first reaction is to scream for a few minutes.After they figured out where the arrows come from and tell each other not to stand in front of windows, they still stand in front of doors with windows.Also, I can't believe they send out a woman running straight out the door thinking if she runs fast enough she could avoid being shot. If the shooter is aiming at the entrance straight on, it would be easy to shoot anyone coming straight out. A more normal person would run out at an angle, and carry something as a shield.Oh, and after the heroine told everyone to always carry a weapons, she frequently walks around without a weapon.There are many more such little stupid stuff that could be easily fixed.

It won't win any awards for the acting or the story but it did its job. It's a slasher film with a sense of realism along with clever kills that I enjoyed watching and laughed at.The first 20 minutes or so are a bit boring as we are introduced to all the characters. Most of them aren't very likable so when the killing actually begins the movie becomes much more entertaining. You almost root for them to be killed, but the one savior is the main character Erin who we do like. When the chaos begins, she takes charge and tries to help everyone.There is a couple of ""twists"" that weren't terribly hard to figure out. What I did like was that at a few different points, the masked killers get tired and need to take a breather. Most slasher films it seems the bad guy never gets tired. It made the movie more realistic and had a sense of humor so to speak.Look past some mediocre acting and enjoy the kills.

To my surprise, I got to see a spritely Amy Seimetz and a dubious Joe Swanberg in supporting roles which made this all the better for having them. Tucci does a very good job handing in a super subtle performance as reserved brother Felix. But Sharni Vinson really takes the cake here, truly grounding herself into the unsettling fiction. Her performance really gets going after the first 30-40 min, as the plot also takes off.Directed by Adam Wingard with a runtime of 95 minutes, the film never drags and feels like a nail biter throughout as we have no idea of the M.O. until more than halfway through.

But putting the tame, bland characters and weak storyline aside, this is a pretty exciting movie with a few stand out horror scenes and a very strong female lead!And when there is humor, it's pretty dang funny, but there isn't enough of it to really call this movie a black comedy. There are a bunch of ideas here, but they are blurred/buried by a terrible supporting cast and their characters who are completely useless. Who on Earth would leave their mom upstairs, ALONE, when there is a group of killers hunting you one by one?

Anyway, there appeared to be a lull in them in the 80s and then they started appearing once more. You're Next is the latest in a line of recent efforts at the genre, and while I'd like to say there's something new here, there isn't. It's been said many times already, but did we need a Strangers remake with an attempt at comedy thrown in? And just two minutes after The Purge arrived? No we didn't. And if it wasn't for the James Wan style marketing of this thing then I doubt many would have bothered.Today horror movies seem to be making a bit of a comeback at our multiplexes, but unfortunately there just ain't much horror in them for those of us who follow this stuff. The Conjuring was a rehash of a hundred movies before it, Insidious 2 was just as predictable, and now it's You're Next.There's been some mention of the humour in You're Next, but it's so low flying you'll bearly notice it. I mean, do we have to be told a movie is a comedy to realize it afterwards? Shouldn't that be obvious? Of course you may say that the gore doesn't make this apparent first hand, but I'm one of the few who nearly pee'd themselves laughing at Human Centipede 2 so I doubt I didn't think it was a comedy due to the timid violence. All in all, You're Next will certainly entertain those who don't watch many horror movies, just as The Conjuring did, and just as Insidious 2 will.

145,The_moan_of_all_moans,You'll laugh....but that's it.,4,1 September 2013,"Having only seen the trailer prior to its release i was adamant that this was a typical horror film. By the end of the viewing i was torn on if it was indeed a typical horror film with scandalous acting and a head scratching plot. Or if it was meant to be this ridiculous. Having came on IMDb and noticed that comedy is the first thing stated when describing its genre, then i have no option but to give it at least a nod of approval as i laughed a lot. I laughed at the horrible dialogue, the silly suggestions, the outrageous overacting, the rusted reactions. Initially i just thought it was a poor excuse for a horror, but there was a small hope that the layout of this film was deliberate. And that hope was realised when clarifying the genre. Because quite frankly nothing is scary, they do try to pull a few jump out your seat moments and unless you're easily scared then you'll have no problems staying seated. The gore is nothing new (well apart from one scene) and if it didn't have that element of comedy throughout it would be a candidate for being the worst film of the year. It brings up many comparisons; scream, home alone, strangers, and the soundtrack can be clearly compared to Tron. This is just a sign of how random the film comes across.If you're looking for a film to laugh at, this is a fair option to consider. It is not a horror, it is not a thriller,it is a comedy; plain and simple. A different type of comedy,but one nonetheless.",You're Next

(And let's be real, it's hard to do non-predictable, original twist these days). The violence was gory enough (and kinda sick!), the acting was solid, the storyline interesting and suspenseful and the hero was kick ass!! I was really surprised this film was this good. The masked villains were super creepy and scary. For some reason, I think these kinds of masks really freak me out. I watch a lot of scary movies, and this thriller was a really nice (and thoroughly exciting) ride. OK, going to watch it again now. The lead actress did a fantastic job.",You're Next
147,twilliams76,Glee and death make a gruesome pairing ... that works!!,6,6 November 2013,"Note: This would get a 6.5 from me ... but that score isn't an option here and rounding-up makes the score appear too high (it is a most perplexing first world problem). Out of something-like 4000 scores here on IMDb, I've given out a scant 57 10's. I'm just very particular. Now for the review: One most-likely would not expect there to be as much dark humor in such a gruesome film like You're Next; but that is just one of the ways this film differs from others in the home-invasion sub-genre (The Purge, Trespass, The Strangers, Kidnapped) of slasher films. There is an abundance of death and dying -- with blood -- on display here as a rather large and argumentative family gathers at their (rural) vacation home before they are picked-off one-by-one by masked individuals for no apparent reason whatsoever other than they have the abilities to do so.Phones are cut off and cell phones are blocked and trying to escape leads to certain death (or so in the one tried attempt) leaving the family with few options other than their own survival skills; but as the family is a bickering one they don't work overly well together and the intruders appear to have the upper hand ... until one unlikely family member proves to be a real survivor with a strange knack for killing (blender to the head anyone?).You're Next does give the audience the oft-seen on screen death and carnage from such a massacre; but it does so in some unexpected ways (as mentioned -- ""death by blender"" is one of the most creative film deaths I have seen in years). The cast are mostly little known character actors from indie film (Joe Swanberg, Sharni Vinson, Amy Seimetz, Ti West) who all do a respectable job here ... you don't laugh at any of them un-intentionally at least. The dialogue might not be the best but it is all acceptable as horror films aren't generally renowned for their characters' conversations as thinking about ""what one says"" is usually trumped by thinking about ""how to survive"". You're Next also relies heavily on the dialogue providing some laughs that might feel out of place but deliver exactly what the filmmakers had intended. The film is briskly paced once the killing begins and once the dying starts it doesn't stop ... and the film never lets up. There is dread and tension for those hoping to survive while some believably appear to be disconnected from what is going on around them.I realize this would not be a film for everybody; but those who like this type of film and the genre (and all of its subsequent sub-genres ... which I admit can get rather tiring) should find this one to be a grand good time. You should laugh ... glee and death may be a gruesome pairing ... but it works here and frequent horror-film director, Adam Wingard, has made his best film yet with this one.(AND this Missouri boy will point out to his Missouri friends that it was filmed in Columbia, Missouri!! Check it out!)",You're Next
148,s_campanale,Back to the Grindhouse for a vintage Brit Horror homage that's set in a big house but is no grind!,9,28 August 2013,"Filmed in 2011, this movie has become a hit on the festival circuit and finally hits major screens 2 years after the fact.It's been predictably marketed as the latest in a string of ""home invasion"" horrors (The affluent American suburban nightmare of the economic breakdown period) but is actually something quite (refreshingly) different. Though set in modern day America, the film is obviously inspired by the cheapo grindhouse horrors of the 70s-early 80s, especially the surreal low-budget British ""Brit-Horrors"" churned out by Amicus, Tigon, EMI, Peerford, Hammer and the like, as well as the even lower budget Australian ""Oz Horrors"" that followed in their wake (It is no coincidence that the ""Ripley"" of the piece is Australian)The creators do a cracking job of reproducing the feel and ambiance of the originals, right down to the unease generating ""weird angle"" camera-work, the saturated colours, the ""one set"" set up and the all- important ""one guy on a keyboard doing everything"" synth-score. What sets it apart from the clumsy efforts of Tarantino, Rodriguez, Burton and co is that unlike their big-budget ""low budget"" movies packed with expensive stars, golden hits soundtracks and top of the line SFX and camera-work, this low budget amateur horror homage is in fact made by low budget amateurs! It is the real deal.The set-up is classic Brit/Oz horror. The wealthy Davison family gathers at their newly acquired gorgeous (but isolated) old Georgian country house to celebrate the parents 35th wedding anniversary, with each of the 5 grown up children bringing a partner with them. There seems little love lost in this family, but family rivalry makes way for some nastier battles as 3 masked assailants start shooting the guests dead with a snipers crossbow! Seeking cover, one by one the Davisons are picked off with machetes, booby traps and axes to the head in a series of nasty horror vignettes. However all is not lost, for plucky Australian literary student Erin (Sharni Vinson), girlfriend of elder Davison son Crispian, happens to have been raised as a survivalist in the outback and is skilled in hand to hand combat and booby trap laying. That would usually be enough for a modern day ""Home Invasion"" pic, but this being Brit/Oz Horror it turns out the attacks are not random and are being orchestrated by a person/persons within the guest list for their own nefarious purposes. Who are the good guys and who are the bad ones? And with this being classic Brit/Oz Horror, is there any chance of a happy ending as the credits start to roll? The film has plenty of blood, though the worse of it usually implied rather than shown (for budget as well as artistic reasons) save for a couple of spectacular kills including killing a baddie with an electric blender that is as impossible as it is amusing in a little nod to the ""gore"" shows of the 80s. The actors are mainly unknowns, hardworking low budget stalwarts who nonetheless are perfect for the material and do as great a job on screen as the production crew do off.If director Adam Wingard and writer Simon Barrett do get catapulted to success by this picture as some of the greats they are name checking (Raimi, Carpenter, Hooper as well as Jackson, Tarantino, Rodriguez and Roth) did then it is unlikely that any of their subsequent films will look like this one alas, so let us enjoy this rare taste of classic horror on our screens while we may and hope that it inspires other film makers to do their own cover versions of the bloody classics of yesteryear.",You're Next
149,StonedMagician,Very Good: 8.5,8,27 July 2019,"At one point in You're Next, a character gets a crossbow bolt through his left shoulder blade. Blood soaks his shirt as the other characters frantically try to stop the bleeding and debate whether or not to put it out. During all this, the audience, myself included, is laughing and clapping. Rather than being sadists, this was just a group or horror fans, who (probably) weren't laughing at the pain the characters were being subjected to. Director Adam Wingard manages to infuse so much raw energy into the proceedings that it's almost impossible not to be intoxicated by it. This is made even more remarkable by the fact that the film tends to take its time. Plot twists and kills are doled out with equal restraint; it would be all to easy to simply pile one on top of the other until the script has exhausted itself. Though the film follows standard home-invasion tropes, it manages to not take itself too seriously. It's not the scariest, or even the bloodiest, horror film of the year, but it's sure as hell one of the most entertaining to come along in a good while.",You're Next
150,fred-287,"A kind of anti-""Funny Games""?",9,25 August 2013,"Okay, truth be told, I haven't seen either the original German ""Funny Games"" or the American remake (I did catch a clip of the latter on You Tube, with the volume turned down) but the original did precede (and inspire?) American horror flicks from the mid-2000's like ""Saw,"" ""Hostel"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"" (and more after those, like ""The Strangers"") with two basic common features: (A) the ""good guys"" are doomed from the outset, and (B) the ""bad guys"" get away with it. Now to some extent we'd been used to movies where most of the victims died except for maybe one (usually the cute heroine, who might wind up nuts or something, as per the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""). What seemed new in the 2000s, though, was the idea of the good guys having NO CHANCE and the bad guys like some primeval force blowing through an area, annihilating everything in their path and moving on without a second thought (or their victims coming to them and getting annihilated). To me this was the ""porn"" part of ""torture porn,"" not so much the violence itself but the notion that it's MEANINGLESS, that the people die because they're there, like bugs getting swatted, with no ""message"" beyond ""You don't like it? Why you watching it?"" Well, I don't know---why do we watch anything that's presented to us? For me, I want to see what perspective the writer/director brings to it; if I just want to revel in bad things happening, there's always You Tube. And oh, by the way, I do love good conflict, I do love a good chase or other Perils-of-Pauline-type predicament, and some gore or mayhem along the way spices up the gumbo, of course...But virtual ""snuff films""? No thanks, y'all.... So here we have Adam Wingard, whose previous stuff I haven't seen (still haven't broken down and bought a DVD player) but have read about; ""He brings back that gut-churning uncertainty from the 1970's,"" someone gushed about ""Home Sick."" If you've seen the trailer for ""You're Next,"" you know the set-up. As the attack by the bad guys interrupts the suburban family's dinner, my first thought was ""Wonder how they'll explain that nobody can call the cops with a cell phone..."" Then a character suggests the bad guys have a ""cell phone blocker""---okay, whatever. (The person who says this turns out to be significant.) Soon the ""anti-Funny Games"" element emerges in the character of Erin, who we learn grew up in an Australian survivalist colony--okay, whatever. The point is, SHE can kick bad-guy ass and SHE is the chief reason to watch this thing. (Yeah, she gets bloodied herself. She's not Steven Seagall after all.) Mr Wingard has rescued the horror genre: once again, it's a contest, not just a slow execution, and that I like. Oh, and Michael Haneke, the Calvinistic director of ""Funny Games""? Up your prim and pure butt, Euro-dude...I haven't even mentioned a really cool plot twist that I WILL NOT give away; others may claim they saw it coming, but now I may go see ""You're Next"" again to see how it all fits in. Very capable performances by the unknown (to me) cast, and as for that Australian chick--I think I'm in love. A few quibbles, like some scenes where the bad guys set something up that seems to rely on their having read the script, and did we really need to hear that early song over and over again? THAT's the ""torture"" part....The ending reminds one of a classic horror flick from the late 1960's that I also don't want to name---I'm sorry if I ""spoiled"" ANYthing, just go out and make some money for Mr Wingard so he can keep single-handedly saving the genre. I'd heartily recommend he keep Erin as a recurring character, or at least keep using that actress in other roles...",You're Next
151,cmovies-99674,"YOU'RE NEXT is a movie with many pros and cons, but overall is a very fun watch",7,11 August 2017,"PROS: Something that YOU'RE NEXT did very well was set up an environment that was unique. You could really appreciate the way the characters interacted in this particular setting. For example, if you saw the same characters with the same plot in a different setting everything would have changed. This is cool because it shows the characters are dynamic and that this setting was the right choice because other settings would have given different endings that might not have been as interesting as this ones. To add on, the actors in this film were good in some aspects, and poor in others, like the way the characters interacted was genuine. This allows for the plot to become more seamless. With actors that feel real it allows for miss ups in the plot to be looked over because real people make mistakes.CONS: Lets continue with the acting. The downfall with some of the acting was with specific actors. I would say one in every three actors were not too good. Another thing that was frustrating was the ending of this movie. It had a good ending with a good connection to the rest of the film, however, it was very long and began to get boring. The audience understood what was happening within the first thirty seconds of dialogue, the finale lasted roughly 5 minutes and that took away from the suspense factor of the resolution. The rising action was great in this movie, but the movie needed either a climax that was less comedic, or a falling action to be more condensed. Other than that I recommend this film, and thanks for reading.www.chorror.com",You're Next

Now, my sense of style lies deeply in the bayous of soundtrack mixing and cinematography. If a film can give me that much, I can deal with boring dialogue and abominable storytelling.With all of that being said, You're Next definitely has its own issues, its clichéd moments, its unnecessary dialogue, you name it . . . but it's bada** Australian lead actress trying to fend off a group of murderous killers stalking a family at a reunion for their parent's anniversary is point-blank impossible not to enjoy. It's a bloody good time, with a great director behind the scenes that really knows what he's trying to grasp, and for a film with mid-ground aimings for its success, this film's goals are very, VERY accomplished. It's a very nice homage to other horror films the genre's fans will notice immediately, whereas newcomers will feel a breeze over their noggins.You're Next was a film I didn't expect to enjoy, and, honestly, wasn't trying to go out of my way to pick up. My family was very interested, but the roles at our table were switched in a way that is astounding; my mother and I loved it, my grandparents despised it.The gore and violence in the film is top-notch due to it being an exploitation film with practical effects that can drop your jaw. It might not be a Tarantino drama or a Kevin Smith thriller, but it's on my list of my favorite fun time films.A huge plus for this film is the score, which has very New Retro Wave-esque music that adds to the homage-motivated picture. I can't express enough to you how lovely that soundtrack is, nor how well it fits into this film's agonizingly worrisome terror. There were times that I felt threatened by these killers, and almost as if I were in the house, as well, with the sensationally sexy Australian lead of the film.When it comes to You're Next, I can't help but exploit the phrase: It's cool as s***!My rating for You're Next is a firm 7.1/10 stars.Michael Kelley",You're Next
153,DogFilmCritic,Predictable,6,8 December 2015,"I saw this movie last night with a friend and we both agreed how predictable this kind of movies get, I'm OK with it as long as its entertaining and if it can get creative.Sadly You're Next is labeled with slasher clichés, the worst thing in this movie was its ""victims"" a family comprised of the most unsympathetic characters I've ever seen, you don't care anything about them, their horrible to each other all the time, you really don't care when they start becoming bloody corpses, i mean you want to feel sorry for this people but it makes it so hard to relate to them.The other thing was the villains, there hinted to have been in the military but the act more like army rejects, ill give credits for the action scenes i have to admit there pretty well done, the soundtrack helps as well but the acting is just awful its painfully overreacted and it feels so forced and I'm a big fan of home invasion movies but the acting is so unnatural it becomes unintentionally funny and that just bring the movie down.The lead actress what the only one interesting enough for anyone to care what ever happened to her, my problem was her back story that made it so convenient for her to get stick in this situation but at least is was something different.I would recommend The Strangers as a far more superior home invasion movie, You're Next is OK at least to me personally, any horror lover knows exactly how this movie works, i give it a low rental or catch it on the t.v. if you get the chance.",You're Next

157,chiguy17,Absolutely ridiculous!,3,23 April 2021,"Quite possibly one of the dumbest, most ill conceived ""horror"" movies I've ever seen. They spent so much time trying to add shock factor and twists they totally skipped over any sort of believability - not only of plot and execution, but character reaction, motivation and just plain physics.The harm it takes to kill someone doesn't even depend on importance of character, just varies wildly from scene to scene solely on the writer's/director's whim. Even the force needed to break a window is unreliable and unrealistic.I'm seriously surprised they didn't manage to decapitate someone with a butter knife - that's how wild and loose they play with the rules in this farce of a movie.A person is practically decapitated just by running into piano wire (literally, just running - not on a motorcycle or anything). A woman jumps through a second or third story window (basically unscathed) and is barely encumbered by a huge shard of glass (that somehow wound up) in her leg, while another woman gets effortlessly thrown through a plate glass window on the ground floor by a 100lb weakling and is cut to ribbons on the tiny fragments of glass. Yet another character is stabbed multiple times - completely unfazed, but is completely crippled by stepping on a nail (despite wearing massive combat boots that wouldn't even be punctured by said nail),In one of the opening scenes, a character is instantly killed by a crossbow somehow penetrating his skull and brain, yet the same crossbow hits another character in the back, and he's fine as soon as he takes a Vicodin. I seriously don't understand the logic of the amateur who wrote this tripe. At least have some consistency and believability as to what can harm a person and how much force is required to break a window (and what damage the act of breaking the window would do).",You're Next

161,Krackoon,One of the better horror films in years.,8,2 September 2014,"If we're lucky, we get maybe one good horror film a year - after that, you'll have to dig deep into the genre to find maybe another gem or two. So, when I saw the trailer for 'You're Next,' I went in with high expectations - and I'm not ashamed to say, maybe my second most anticipated film of 2013, next to 'Before Midnight.' Did it live up to my expectations? Over-hyped? Maybe, but for the budget, it's a surprisingly well made film. Not without it's flaws or plot holes, though. What we get is, a lot of overacting, which is to be expected and not a negative for this style of film. The character development is also a nice bonus. Throw in a few funny moments, and probably my favorite villains in recent years, who are so bad at what they're trying to accomplish, the 90 minute run time will seem more like 60 - because they're just that fun to watch. However, the motivation behind the killings is rather disappointing and cliché (I had a twist in mind. A decent one, at that.) It's not all cliché, though, due to a heroine who doesn't rely on luck to turn the tables on her attackers. We also get two kick ass versions of 'Looking for the magic,' that you'll hear throughout the film. It's a fun ride, albeit a short one, at least to me.Random Ramblings of a Madman: 'You're Next' ended up being one of my favorite films of 2013, thanks to 'the Animals.' The removal of the masks was something I feared throughout the film, and what could have been a disaster, ended up being the right choice. Some people question the acting - but certain films just wouldn't be the same with household names. The actors here come across as having a great time, and it shows throughout the entire film - would 'The Shining' have been a better film if Meryl Streep had been cast as the damsel in distress? Or if Jack Nicholson wasn't the king of overacting? Probably not.",You're Next

There, we meet a wealthy couple; who are getting ready for an awkward family reunion. Our main character Erin, played by the beautiful Sharni Vinson, (Bait 3D, & Step Up 3D) accompanies her boyfriend Crispian, played by A.J. Bowen ( A Horrible Way To Die, & The Sacrament).In addition, when the whole family gets together for dinner and discussion, that's when an argument starts between Crispian and his brother Drake, played by Joe Swanberg (Drinking Buddies & A Horrible Way To Die). SUDDENLY, Drake gets shot, with a crossbow arrow that comes flying through a nearby window. Erin notices three masked men outside holding weapons, and that's when she knows some sh#t is about to hit the fan.I really enjoyed this film from the start. It had an interesting prologue, well done camera work, some humor, an awesome style of throwback music, well written characters, and one of the most bad ass final girls I've seen in years. I honestly believe, that Erin will go down in scream queen history with Neve Campbell ,Jamie Lee Curtis, and Heather LangenKamp.Even though this genre has been done before, with films like The Strangers, Panic Room, and The Purge. I believe You're Next stands on it's own. Mainly because it's not afraid to do it's own thing. Such as, the chemistry between all the actors, it keeps you guessing (Erin's past), has an interesting twist, and it keeps you wanting more (especially with the way it ends).Director Adam Wingard crafts together an amazing movie. However, in my opinion, his even better talent is working with the score, unique editing, old school style and influences of filmmaking.I truly do feel like this is one of the best horror movies in a very long time. The anticipation/word of mouth of this movie had me wanting to view it for months. It's different, especially the style techniques, the gore is for a reason, the writing is awesome, it has direction, the pacing is just right, and the score. The ending to this movie goes crazy, Erin is a bad ass babe, and a twist I didn't expect. I'm very interested in seeing what Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett have next.

This isn't supposed to be Oscar bait, it's a slasher horror movie, and it does that very well. The plot is good, and not really what you're expecting if you go in blind. I LOVE seeing a strong female lead and this movie has an excellent one. Sharni Vinson does a great job and should be an example to people, especially smaller and weaker people, that they don't have to be helpless victims if they will prepare themselves and learn some self defense and survival skills. Too many people walk through life with the ""it won't happen to me"" attitude and think somehow their cell phone and a cop that is 15+ minutes away is somehow going to save them from a crazy person with a weapon. No, you need to learn how to handle yourself because the chances anyone will get to you in time are slim to none. Of course, this movie probably would have been quite short if only the dad had a gun, but that's a discussion for another day and another place. Check this movie out if you like slashers, horror, thrillers, and especially if you enjoy seeing a smart, attractive lady take on some criminals. Don't walk through life unprepared.

But it comes out looking like ""Bay of Blood,"" a surprising family blood feud that ends badly for everyone, and was lots of fun. For the first half hour, as we meet various unattractive loser characters whose actions and dialogue seems largely pointless, through the beginning of the home invasion where the audience was in stitches as a character ran in slow motion into razor wire. It looked like the movie was a failure and the audience (scarier so far than the film itself) was about to rebel and turn the movie into an interactive ""Rocky Horror"" like experience. Then, the Australian girlfriend of one of the brothers in the family at the center of the home invasion, begins fighting back and put the film squarely back on track, and won the audience back. As we lose many central characters and learn the motivations of the masked invaders, the stakes raise for one of the most proactive Final Girls I've seen in a while. The ending is a bloody, satisfying free for all that is both suspenseful and funny and elicited cheers. There were great moments of subtle intentional humor, but parts of the movie seem deadly earnest and simply don't work. The characters at the beginning are either loathsome – not in a good way - or not likable enough to win us over. This is why the audience was at first on the side of the villains. I don't think that all of this was intentional on the part of the filmmaker. The clumsy beginning and weak characters are the only things stopping me from not rating it even higher.",You're Next

179,Atomic_Peace,Your money is Next: Rental,6,1 October 2013,"After making a premiering marathon, going from Tiff to Sxsw, You're Next is finally in local cinemas. You're Next is like the poor man's Cabin in the Woods. This is not a compliment.The story is about the Davison family, at their family reunion we are occupied by nagging and fighting for a while, but then their home comes under siege. Is it worth your wait? Well...After making a premier at Tiff, critics and film-goers came out praising the movie, like it was almost the next Halloween or Scream. So that sold me. Here's how this movie was probably conceived: Adam Wingard and company went to go see Cabin in the Woods, completely wrecked, they were came back to their apartment, heard some creaking floor-boards, saw a mask they had left over from Halloween, and got a writing. At some point when they were casting, they decided to just say f*ck it, let's cast our friends, and now, we have You're Next.I was kind of eager to see it, being the horror freak I am, I went in head-held high. But the praise murdered over this movie.As I watched the film, I began to realize how hyped this was.Let's get back to the ""casting friends"" thing. If you ever remember making those little short movies you made as a kid, if you go through them, they will most likely be armed to the teeth with your old buddies. It's almost like Adam Wingard loved that experience so much as a child, he decided to relive the magic, it's that, or he never really grew up at heart.The acting was truly appalling. We have some horror directors and writers in this movie (I only recognized one or two of them, being that I'm more of a classic horror movies kind of guy) and I was about to throw myself out of a window. Scenes that were intended to have tension had bickering children, and it was the worst experience.When the horror kicks in, I was surprised how sudden the gear shift was. I was actually glad to see some characters die, and if your writing is that bad, I'll begin to question your stance in Hollywood. But the scares itself were pretty solid, I think it's purely the fact that these people, having their history and track-record they do, you're bound in for a good scare or two. And I'll tell you; I jumped out my seats here and then again.On it's own merits, it's just on the cutting line between Rental and Screw It, but watching it on your own at night has to be something else, so Rental.",You're Next

Even considering acting wasn't that bad here at all.This movie is all about sending out a message about family ties (thus money over family or family over money) in a brutal way. It perfectly does that with a simple plot and setting coupled with a few gore here and there. It would even get you thinking right after watching.I personally like how the female protagonist takes the fight to the killers, this is the best genuine female lead hero i have seen in long time.To sum it up this movie isn't about scary scenes, but rather hack, pummel and slash.

184,RocketeerFlyer,Barbara Crampton makes another HORROR Classic!,8,2 December 2015,"I am a huge HORROR fan but not so much of the SLASHER type of movies.I'm into the more fantastical / supernatural creature types such as ""The Fly"", ""The Fog"", ""From Beyond"", ""The Return of the Living Dead"", ""Fright Night"", ""The Monster Squad"", ""Dracula"" this kind of thing.This is why even though it co-starred one of my all-time favourites in the form of 'Barbara Crampton' (aging beautifully I might add) I ignored it because of the slasher format.My mistake as this is possibly the BEST of it's kind.It brought back memories of 'The Osterman Weekend' meets 'Halloween' (those bunny masks were scary) meets 'Assault on Precinct 13'Barbara's terrific and gives a 3rd horror classic to add to her previous two (Re-Animator & From Beyond) there's even what looked to be an in-joke scene? in which our heroine (Sharni Vinson as Erin) jumps through a window in similar style to Barbara's Dr Katherine McMichaels in the final scene in From Beyond (I think these makers are big fans of her's?)Speaking of Sharni Vinson as Erin she just works from the moment you see her...superb starring role who carries the film to perfection.The direction and music score give nods to John Carpenter of old when he was at his peak in the 1970's and 80's and this adds terrifically to the overall tension.I can only say that I am SORRY I did not watch this film earlier as it's just about as good as a slasher type film can get without going that extra mile and becoming what people now call horror torture porn, types of films that I simply do not like! Don't get me wrong I'm still not a huge fan of slasher films as I've said (The Halloween films are a little different because Michael Myers has something of the supernatural aspect about him) but if like me they're not your kind of thing either maybe I can persuade you to give this one a go, go on try it, i'd put it top of the tree for this type of film.There is a neat little twist at the end which many of you might see coming followed by another incident.There's even a little humour at play here (the scene in which shall we say one of the very bad men comes through the window was highly amusing)Overall a very nice surprise and a BIG shout out to my favourite horror heroine of all-time BARBARA CRAMPTON whose return to the horror genre simply brings a smile to my face and what's more from the interviews I've seen of her she seems a genuinely nice, fun, engaging and polite person and in my eyes that's ALWAYS a good thing. Barbara's PB layout is one I'd longed to see for years and it's one of the coolest, funniest and sexiest photo-shoot's i've ever seen, I do hope she smiles when or if she looks back on them because they're a great snapshot of the re-animator / from beyond era of fun!Congratulations to all that made this film...it's a corker!!!",You're Next

I felt that the direction, performances and camera-work all served the story brilliantly. They held my attention and kept me very entertained! Frankly, I'm confused by the negative reviews the film has received - there is much to admire here. Every scene seems to have a character-driven gem, yet the film never succumbs to the temptation to stray from the needs the film has set out to satisfy.This story has a interesting variation on masked villains who terrorize with the dehumanizing quality of that trope. I also loved the quality of writing and performances which the siblings' biting interaction complicates and informs how the story evolves.I especially loved the fresh energy poured through the terrific characters, particularly Erin (Sharni Vinson). The entire film seems to hinge on her sustained force of will and helps ground the film's violence in human terms, rendering yet another layer in the evolution of horror-female as victim/anti-victim.The film is so lean that describing anything runs the risk of giving away surprises. With that, I simply hope that you give the film a chance - I highly recommend it!",You're Next
189,mecheart,Croc Dundee's daughter repels home invasion ...,2,13 September 2013,"I have gone into many slasher films over three decades and more dumbfounded repeatedly by victim(s) written without even a basic ability to fight back against the masked men running amok with machete and hunting knife. A hard coded rule of the slasher film adhered to by numerous outings: the more a protagonist fights back, the worse he or she suffers until their eventual death. Thus my interest in a slasher feature billed as one where the least likely victim not only fights back, but wins. Another recent film in the genre failed its promise to deliver the same ('No One Lives').Speaking to character, a writer must walk a fine line to deliver a protagonist from victimized to bloodied victory without painting her as more vicious than the killer(s). Normally this is done in sequences best described as trials by or under fire through the survival of which the heroine grows her courage and combat skills. It is a primal story theme powerful as it is poignant in its ability to connect an audience with the character, and develop her in a maelstrom before their very eyes.In 'You're Next' the heroine Erin (Sharni Vinson) comes prepackaged a bad-ass, despite her portrayal as a meek tag along until her instant transformation when the killing starts. Erin is the sole strong character among ten others, so mentally and physically more competent than everyone else, she alone knows how to drive a nail through wood or kick a man in that place.There is no gradual turnover in Erin, nor does she begin weak and grow stronger through negotiation of the increasingly difficult problems she faces as a small band of masked killers slaughter their way through her boyfriend's sizable family. She instantly becomes a ninety pound engine of destruction which only revs higher the longer she is threatened. I much prefer a character who must dig deep into inner strength she was unaware she had in the first place.Regarding the rest, the premise of the film has potential for high entertainment value but its makers squandered it in their painfully obvious by the numbers execution likely a consequence of bad writing and directing.The screenplay fails to flesh out the other nine characters who are not Erin which is a shame as it does briefly ignite friction between two of three brothers in an argument at family dinner. Here must be drawn a comparison between slasher films of the seventies and eighties and the lot currently trending. The ensemble slasher movie is three decades old and more, surely then a concept rife with examples from which to draw buckets of fresh blood. Where genre films of that bygone era often painted skillfully interesting depth even into characters killed within minutes of their opening acts, pictures such as 'You're Next' shape most of their supporting cast as cardboard cutouts lacking the ability to think or act at the slightest sign of trouble. In the case of the film in question: ""Who are the members of this zany wooden family, and why should we care if they die?"" This film comes packing a couple of twists although they are divergent from the light in which its masked killers are first painted and the wooden, lifeless responses of family members to the deaths of their loved ones telegraph plainly what the reveals will be, that or forces you to believe the acting and writing are worse than you imagined believable.The masked killers themselves are uninteresting and of the variety you've seen many times before, slasher fan or not. They wear bright white animal faces and black tactical gear. Do they want to blend into the night, or not? They carry the most unwieldy of mêlée weapons and use crossbows despite the remote location of their targets. And they paint blood graffiti on the walls of their victims' homes hinting at their sadistic nature, yet the death of one of their own proves them just as emotionally human as anyone else.The rest is beat after beat of nonsensical supporting character behavior and senseless repetition. The bad guys kill the neighbors two minutes into act one yet the script returns us two more times to their house where a highly annoying song is playing on repeat, you've been warned. A killer peers over a window sill, sees a trap laid there by our heroine, and then steps on it anyway. A victim runs slow motion into a metal wire hung at Adam's apple height. What if her much taller brother had come out first? The heroine rigs a lethal trap at the front door, but the bad guys keep using the window beside it to get in. Long after a killer slays someone inside an upstairs bedroom, another character says ""I think it's safe to assume one of them is inside."" Much in the same vein follows.Viewer response thus far to 'You're Next' has astonished me. That or there's hidden quality I am missing in films such as this.This is an ensemble home invasion slasher film. It's often funny - at the writer's expense - and although it promises to break genre standards, offers up implausibility on high in its heroine's back story as the child of survivalists. Its greatest mistake: she is more psychopathic than the killers themselves who look like they've escaped from the sets of other movies from a few years back. I suppose they grew tired of 'The Strangers' and then were 'Purge'(ed}.Fans of supernatural horror need not enter - nor most horror movie buffs past their thirty-fifth year.Minus nine for killers wearing animals masks, plus one for Ti West, minus one for his death, and plus none for the sequel to Crocodile Dundee starring his daughter ... the damsel who kicks ass.",You're Next

They wind up being trapped in the home and stalked/terrorized by a group of killers wearing animal masks.It took me a long time to get around to this one for no particular reason and frankly I found it disappointing. There were some decent ideas here, some creative kills/gore and a strong performance from the lead actress Sharni Vinson, but they were undercut by mediocre dialogue, poor plotting/unbelievable motivations, inconsistent performances from supporting cast, camera work that didn't complement certain sequences and dare I say a criminal underuse of Barbara Crampton as the family matriarch (perhaps her choice and not the film-maker).All of the above led to an inconsistent tone... it never quite fell into the groove of being an earnest horror or getting ready to go camp. Even the score was inconsistent when in the climax it switches from a complimentary ambient synth to full on 80's techno.Funny enough just last week I watched director Adam Wingard's most recent film, Godzilla vs. Kong, and it seems 10 years on he still doesn't seem too concerned about plotting.6/10.

The only inventive part was the blender scene, that was kind cool, although blood is not brown and that is what it looked like.

You're next is a horror slasher with bits of comedy that is starting to gain a cult status. Independent in terms of budget, You're Next works both as a tribute for the slasher genre from the 70's and 80's and, in itself, as a b-movie, adding comedy pieces (that sometimes masked the poor acting in a very smart way) and over the top gore to its low budget. Plus, the 80's reminder soundtrack refined that feeling. You can't help but laugh sometimes, and you should, making this a very rare experience with horror movies in the 21st century. The Evil Dead remake already did something similar early this year, however You're Next really deserves more credit due to the circumstances of its production and path: since it was an independent movie, even if it was produced in 2011, You're Next first was exhibited in some horror movie festivals, but the praise it got led it for a wide theater release in August 2013. However, it isn't the game changing horror movie that some claim it to be. It does not challenge the genre, it plays with it, and that is a very fresh feeling. This movie is indeed pure: it doesn't force you to love it, nor does it cheat you, and it is a great experience, mainly to see in a crowded theater or with some friends.

I'm not against movies starting out with sex scenes or anything but it was a horrible sex scene and the couple didn't look believable unless she was a hooker cause she was too hot for him. Anyway that aside the first killings don't really make sense until later anyway.I liked that for once the characters were normal looking people and actually adults-not your typical college kids on a weekend getaway like most horror film casts. The family was good however not quite as plausible as the family on The Hills have eyes. The main actress is our protagonist and ass kicker if you will.It's always nice to have that one smart character who doesn't panic opposite the one screaming ""we're gonna die"". I also got a kick out of the random bits of comic relief however corny it may have seemed. Obviously given the masks you get The Strangers vibe but I actually liked it better than the Strangers just because it was more entertaining than watching Liv Tyler walk around for half an hour (not to say it wasn't a good film though! but you gotta admit that's true about it!) I really enjoyed the twist and didn't see it coming. I also really liked the ending. It was a good horror movie finale. I didn't feel the title was the best one they could've come up with but like i said this is a horror movie people! If you actually thought this was bad watch Evil Bong which by the way is still not even close to the worst horror movie title I've ever heard.",You're Next
196,iSkyWalKing,Inside Job,9,25 June 2020,"This is a great horror/home invasion film. I have seen a few films from the director and I'll be honest I'm not a big fan of his work. That being said he has two particular films that stand out by far and which I love, 'The Guest' and this one.This one hits all the marks for genre fans. Interesting story, brutal and violent, high tension and a bit creepy at times with a score that is very fitting for the film. This falls into the upper echelon of the home invasion/horror films. It brings some unique elements and is highly entertaining. As with most films of this type, it is aimed at it's particular audience and it absolutely fills that void. 'You're Next' is an excellent horror film and one I've watched on more than one occasion... Do recommend.",You're Next
197,FSfilmblog,A rollicking ride,8,5 September 2013,"From the team that bought us the horror anthologies V/H/S and The ABC's of Death, comes a story about a family get together being interrupted by what seems to be a random attack from animal mask wearing killers. As each family member gets picked off, one of the family guests emerges with an instinctive survival nature to fight back. It's been a long wait for this home invasion horror film to make it's way to the big screen yet normally this would ring alarm bells as to why there has been such a long delay for it's release. The apparent reason behind this is the lack of interest from distributors willing to take a chance.Now, there isn't anything new or original in the story/plot but what is done on screen is carried out and executed brilliantly. Majority of the characters are paper thin in detail and most come off as horrible and/or unsympathetic beings that you want to see bite the bullet. One does suspect though this is what the filmmakers wanted us to feel.As the family members bicker on what to do when the first of them is swiftly shot down by a an arrow, the film suddenly shows it's diabolically dark humour. When they argue about who is to run for help, they debate on each others physical statue or how one brother won't make it because of his size, you realise that the film has injected and splice in a family drama amongst a horror film. It's this strange mix which gives the film it's uniquely engaging entertainment.The film does have it's fair share of cheap scares (characters off screen suddenly appearing, or quiet then loud moments) but it's to be expected. Though the way in which most of the family members are set up, you'll gladly cheer for them to die in the most brutal way possible. The positive points for the film has to go to the mask the killers wear. They are a master stroke in how to make something look pretty creepy and disturbing (unfortunately when the mask comes off, the sense of fear and panic does wains). The setting and location is visually striking and menacing, it's isolation and remoteness fuels the nightmarish subject matter. The actors are passable, no famous stars you would recognise unless you are au fait with horror films (glad to see Ms Barbara Crampton back on the big screen). A hugely enthralling and enjoyable film which also has a satisfying ending. Go in with an open mind and prepare to laugh as well as being terrified.",You're Next
198,joeywyss,Worst. Movie. Ever.,1,19 January 2014,"I wish I could actually give it negative stars. This is complete and utter nonsense. A non-existent script that the actors blindly ad-lib through, clearly making it all up as they go along. They fumble and flail worse than any of the 'found footage' junk I've waded through. The worse thing is they don't seem like it's their first time in front of a camera, but they obviously just showed of to set and were told to just wing it. There are Plot holes big enough to swallow actual Black Holes with room to spare. A story that is so cliché it's an insult to the word 'cliche'. The action is Clogged with 'gotcha' moments that don't 'getcha', and is repetitive to a fault. Even the music is off-putting. I found myself wishing somebody in a mask would break in and chop my own head off. I kept waiting thinking , it has to get better, but it actually just keeps sinking deeper into farce. Ed Wood seems like Spielberg or Scorsese compared to this director. I weep for the millions of dollars wasted here that could have funded so many other independent movies instead of this tripe.",You're Next

200,Hal_Opinot-Pepper,"Pointless, gratuitous ""plot porn"" totally ruins 90 good minutes of people being murdered.",1,18 August 2014,"This movie is well-produced, well acted, extremely realistic in its gore and violence. Unfortunately, I have to give it only one star because about for almost whole 10 minutes at the beginning and end of the movie, they stop showing people getting murdered, to waste time bogging it down with some throwaway backstory or reason for the murders, or something, completely from out of left field. I'm not sure... it was people talking, not characters getting stabbed in the eye or having a blender shoved down onto the top of their head, so I couldn't sustain any attention to it. In what universe are people actually entertained by someone SAYING WHY they kill people? Are there really people out there who sit and watch scenes of people talking, not killing or being murdered at all, and find that entertaining? I highly doubt it.It's a shame. This film's director, and writer if there was one, clearly could have had a future, and probably a great franchise opportunity with this film — if they hadn't sold out and inserted scenes for the sole purpose of pandering to people who only go to movies for ""plot"" or ""dialogue"". I sense the marketing department or some other beancounters urging the filmmakers to go back and add these scenes after the film had already wrapped, just to throw in something to please the lowest-common-denominator idiots who can't even be happy with a 95 minutes collection of murder scenes. Unfortunately, these pointless, gratuitous non-violent acts completely break the otherwise uninterrupted fever pitch of nonstop brutality, and what would have been a top notch, totally solid 95 minutes of human deaths is stymied by the crassly commercial attempt to suggest ""plot"" or ""dialogue"".This weird, boring non-violent non-violence provides an especially disappointing anti-climax when, unbelievably, it occurs a whole SECOND time near the end for some reason. Until that point it's been just killing, killing, killing, one murder scene after another for long enough that you can actually start to forget about the cinematically bankrupt initial minutes of non- murder and begin to enjoy the movie, when, boom, then it happens AGAIN. One early scene of people not getting murdered might have been forgivable. A second one, right near what should have been the climax of the film, just leaves the viewer wondering what the director was thinking that he allowed such ham-fisted, totally gratuitous irrelevancies into his film — not just once but TWICE.At least these pointless minutes of ""plot porn"" are prevented from completely ruining the end of the film, by being suddenly followed in the final minutes with a few more gory, explicit murders (and even the last-minute introduction of a totally new character for the sole purpose of squeezing in just one more axe axe splitting a head open before the credits roll!) I have to imagine after being forced to sully their film with stupid scenes of people talking to each other, they probably snuck back in to the studio late at night and added those final few minutes on the quiet, without the marketing department or whoever demanded they ruin the movie to give it ""box office appeal"" or something knowing about it, to spare us having to leave the theater with the lamentable spectacle of people SAYING THINGS — not even killing or dying while they say them, just SAYING THINGS! — lingering in our minds. Good for them for sneaking that in, that last-ditch attempt at quality filmmaking is the only reason I can honestly give the film its 1 star. I'm glad the production team came to their senses and at least respected the audience enough to end it so well, sparing us from having the lamentable spectacle of characters SAYING THINGS — not even killing or dying while they say them; just SAYING things! — stuck lingering in our head as they exit the theater. I don't understand what would even give someone the idea to put something like that in a movie, what kind of sellout director would allow it. This obvious mercenary ploy to cash in by appealing to the lowest common denominator, even for just a few minutes near the beginning and end, completely ruins what would have been the greatest movie since the history of cinema began back in 1978 with ""Last House On The Left"". It's sad, tragic really, how close this film came, and how badly it failed. Ah, to dream of what could have been, and murders.",You're Next

207,Caesarboy5,Truly Horrifying,9,4 April 2014,"What makes something horrifying?Many people find it's about being frightened by the surreal to the point of worrying about it in real life. Others think it's about having a fast-heart rate after seeing some serious jump-scares.While there's nothing wrong with answering with the above, You're Next is none of the above. It's something much more sinister, at least in my opinion. It's about two sons who plan to have their entire family brutally murdered for money... It's just sickening thinking about it, which is a testament to the movie's fine selection in subject matter and execution.THE GOOD:From a TECHNICAL standpoint, the film is perfect. Great camera work, appropriate music, great editing, directing, etc...I loved the sense of PACING. It instilled a true sense of horror and panic. CHARACTERS were developed interestingly and I found myself invested in them and their well-being. I seriously wanted the villains to die more than anything at the end. When you're begging for a happy ending, you know the film is doing something right (I have seen so many movies where I am begging for the movie to not cop-out and give an unwarranted happy ending).The GORE was one of the best aspects of the film. It made the film gross and memorable. Just the way I like it.I liked the fact that the film was GROUNDED IN REALITY, which makes it so much more awful when you find out the truth.The film had a great sense of DARK HUMOR, especially with the death of the police officer at the end. The TWIST was also amazing. While it wasn't unpredictable with all the hints, that's what made it so great. If you caught on, you felt smart. If you didn't, it didn't feel like the BS ending of a Shamylyon movie. THE BAD:The ACTING was a bit strange (especially with the dad) in some places, but most people probably won't even notice.Some people may find it another case of ""she was just lucky"" with the main character's survival. But I find the investment in her character was enough to offset that feeling. Her back story also helped things.Some people seem to have a problem with the first fifteen minutes. I didn't see what was so wrong with it. Finally, one plot point annoyed me (but this is just a nitpick, just sharing a feeling, this doesn't make the movie any bad). The fact that the daughter ran outside (only to die) really annoyed me because it just made no sense to go where the killers weren't. Regardless, no one seems to think straight when people are dying, so I guess it was justifiable. To me it just seemed a bit too dumb. But I digress.THE VERDICT:This film is amazing and if you have ever enjoyed a good slasher film, or just horror movies in general, you HAVE to watch this. It is amazing, brutal, and just disturbing if you can see the motives for what they are. I may give this film a 10/10 after some reflection, but for now I will give it a 9/10 (I just feel like it wasn't perfect, but then again, my favorite movies weren't my favorite until I reflected on them):9/10",You're Next

209,edgereviews,You're Next Review,9,8 January 2014,"You're Next is the second major house invasion movie of 2013, after 'The Purge'. Now, 'The Purge' is an awful, awful, truly horrendous movie, so bad in fact that it's on my worst movies of 2013 list. Not only is You're Next a much better movie than 'The Purge', it's by far the best horror movie of the year.Certain parallels can be drawn between You're Next and 2012′s 'The Cabin In The Woods'. Both movies start off as fairly generic horror movies specific to the type of movie they are; in the case of You're Next it's a home invasion movie. But they soon turn into something much different and entirely more original than we were initially lead to believe. Even the generic stuff in You're Next is done excellently and to a much higher quality than most other movies do it. The script is very unique and original, with good characters and a satisfying twist at the end.The acting is good as well. Seeing as there are a lot of characters in a relatively short movie, not all of them get much screen time. Sharni Vinson plays Erin, the character who we spend the most time with and she is excellent in the role. A movie like this doesn't give much opportunity to showcase acting talent but all of the characters are good in their roles.I didn't find You're Next to be scary at all, however I rarely find horror movies to be scary. In fact, I found You're Next to be a hell of a lot funnier that I expected it to be, I laughed quite hard on a few occasions. Adam Wingard does an excellent job directing, the cinematography is great and there are some really nice shots and cuts. The movie is very unpredictable, I never knew where the plot was headed and the soundtrack is also excellent. I strongly recommend you watch You're Next, it's incredibly entertaining and I wouldn't be surprised to see it become a cult classic in the future.",You're Next

However, as a satire of slashers and home invasion thrillers, it's pitch perfect and hits the mark more often than not. Filled with irony and self-awareness, the movie is a perfect companion piece to The Cabin in the Woods.The story consists of a dysfunctional family gathering at the farmhouse for dinner where they start arguing and are ambushed by a trio of masked maniacs out to kill 'em one by one. However, the girlfriend of one of the sons of the family turns out to be a feisty little thing and here is where the fun starts.Sharni Vinson is brilliant as the spunky and courageous female protagonist. She is careful to make Erin badass but likable. Joe Swanberg is hilarious as the annoying brother who still cares for his family and simply won't die. Also, it's really cool to see Barbara Crampton back and she is as lovely as ever.Ultimately, You're Next is one of the most underrated movies out there with a healthy mix of horror, humour and gore.

219,Naive-fox,The wolf in sheep's clothing,3,19 August 2017,"In the perfect mood for some mindless violence and some gruesome humor, a slasher always seem the obvious choice. Not being a big fan of the genre for the difficulty of making a believable film that brings a real sense of fear, I let myself be guided by the critics and reviews and finally fall for 'You're next', the umpteenth genre redefining movie.Soon I discover that I've been tricked not one, but twice by the siren voices and the empty promises of reviews as little realistic as the film they refer to. The unsavory déjà vu of the dinner scene is a clear reminder that I had seen the movie before, and for good reason not seen it through.Decided to make it to the end credits this time, I give Adam Wingard and his 'You're next' an undeserved second chance. One that would only confirm suspicion that the whole film never gets to achieve a sense of continuity and real threat. What should have -given by how the story unfolds- been a cold blooded, efficient mass murder ends up as some senseless one on one assassinations even amidst the crowd within the mansion. Even the foreseeable plot ""twist"" mid-film does nothing but kill the little suspense and tension the previous footage had managed to grow.But ultimately, it is the complete absurdity in every character's actions that kills the little effect the film could have produced. From characters standing alone on a room with a corpse even after everyone has left and running out in panic seconds later only to get easily killed; to people standing carelessly right in front of windows or opened doors just minutes after being the target of a hail of crossbow bolts; all through the real and genuine Crocodile Dundee of the film, the expert in survival who goes locking downstairs glass windows - some of them already broken- to prevent bad guys from entering or leaves the axe of an assaulter on the carpet because it's always a wiser idea to defend oneself with a screwdriver.Not only does 'You're next' not revive the slasher genre, but systematically repeats all the big mistakes that make most flicks of the kind dull and repetitive, offering nothing but a bunch of histrionic deaths and a story that lacks both backbone and a smooth skin.",You're Next
220,richardv81,Best Horror movie In a long time,8,20 August 2013,"I had the opportunity to see an advance screener of You're Next thanks to Cinemit & GoFobo. When I first saw the trailer I knew this would be a movie that I would have to see in theaters. I am not a huge horror movie fan, especially the direction they have pulled with so many found footage films over the last few years. So as I was excited to see what this movie could bring to the table I was equally optimistic. So after seeing the movie I am going to give you something I liked and didn't like.Story: When the Davison family comes under attack during their wedding anniversary getaway, the gang of mysterious killers soon learns that one of the victims harbors a secret talent for fighting back.1. This was the 1st film I have ever seen of Adam Wingard's and I won't lie it was a pretty impressive 1st impression. From start to finish he built a solid story that kept you guessing. It had a very nice slow build when they were introducing the characters and BAM right into some serious bloodshed. It was everything that I enjoy about a good horror movie.He really put together some awesome action/kill scenes in the film. Whether it was a dumb move from the ""bad guy"" or it was a smartly place board with nails in it, he really went out of his way to make some really cool killings.2 There were some nice twist and turns. You could see some coming and then you had a few that were a nice surprise as well.3 The score/music. Every great horror movie has some great music/score. This had it in here and I loved every minute of it. When killing someone in a movie it can really be ruined by either a crappy set up or a poor score.4 I really liked the dysfunctional family idea they had for this. It wasn't a perfect family that was unexpectedly attacked.5 Sharni Vinson (Erin) was nice on the eyes and was the star of the show.6 They made the vocal point of the movie the killings. That isn't done in many horror movies anymore.7 The Ending was awesome. That's all I will say about that.8 I guess you could complain about the acting, but with a low budget horror movie you get a bunch of C and D list acting.9 They had some poor attempts at some comedy that came off pretty rough.10 Lastly, I would have liked to see a bit more gore and blood. It wasn't over the top like ""Evil Dead"" was this year but they could've made it a little bit more gory.Final Verdict 4 out of 5 stars Overall this is the best horror movie I have seen in a long time. Wingard brought a lot of key components to this movie that I really enjoy. I enjoyed the smart killings, the various ways of how he killed some people and they provided an awesome score to go with the flow of the movie. I would recommend any horror fans to see this movie this weekend when it comes out.You're Next comes out in theaters this Friday.Check out the review here.http://thesportsscript.com/2013/08/20/youre-next-review/",You're Next

222,Bonhamkt,Horror Trunk: You're Next (2013) Review: Beast Feast.,6,28 August 2013,"You're Next is directed by Adam Wingard, who is no stranger to the horror genre after his infamous shorts in both VHS films and The ABC'S of Death. We see a family getaway turn nightmare, when the Davison family become target by three masked killers. However, they did not anticipate one of the guests ready to put up a deadly fight.... The invasion of the 'happy' home is recurring theme in horror, the originally of this film comes from the unsuspected survival element from one of the guests. The fact that You're Next is not about a paranormal occurrence is pretty much exciting in itself, but the widespread hype for this film and its national cinema release speaks volumes. The film relies heavily on the storyline and script to carry it through, which works to build the anticipation and suspense of each 'kill', however a need to over complicate by offering an unnecessary explanation leaves this film feeling slightly flat.The gore is plentiful, as it offers a showcase of particularly painful incidents and nasty ways to die. The inclusion of animal masks offers an 'old school' horror element; of fear created from the simplest notion of hidden identity by dehumanising of the killers ('Don't bother locking the doors. Animals don't use doors'.) You're Next offers a fun horror that is a descent addition to home invasion. A well put together feature that deserves to have its time in the theatres. With huge similarities to the Korean horror film 'To Sir, With Love', there is no great originality to this film, but it does the job in conveying and creating fear, where everyone's safest place in the world becomes a house of horror.

How refreshing is that?However there were two glaring places where the movie crossed the line from an A movie to a B- at best. No spoilers here but I will give the time and you'll see what I mean: 31 min (these people would never have allowed this) then at 83 min another event that was out of character for the rest of the movie. Those two events trimmed three stars off from what I would have given had the scenes been written differently.Well worth the watch, I've seen it twice and I'll watch it again somewhere down the line, but... I'll still cringe at 31 & 83 minutes for what degraded this otherwise awesome movie.",You're Next
226,The_After_Movie_Diner,Great to see a decent horror film again...,9,13 September 2013,"I would count myself as a reasonably hardcore horror fan but ask me about most so-called horror past things like Saw 1, Cabin Fever or Final Destination and I would draw a blank. I am sure there are films out there that I am missing (although I dip my toes back into the genre from time to time) but mostly the films seem to be grind-house style rip-offs of exploitation films, found footage films, gritty, grimy, greeny/brown and gross films, torture porn, CGI fueled messes, fast zombies, tweeny PG-13 nonsense or, of course the dreaded remake and all of those, quite frankly, can shove off. I have little to no interest in any of that stuff.Now I had the unabashed, joyful pleasure to interview Barbara Crampton last year about her work with Stuart Gordon in the 80s (some of my favourite of the genre) and the restarting of her career with Lords of Salem and You're Next. Sadly she was cut out of Lords of Salem but, thankfully, she remained very much in You're Next. So, of course, I was going to see it. It could've been a torture porn remake featuring a fast zombie falling love with a drippy teen made in the grind-house style and I still would've been there with bells on. Barbara Crampton's return to our cinemas needed to be seen and supported. No question.Well I couldn't be happier to report that, firstly, You're Next is none of the above and, secondly, it is a resounding success. An entertaining, independently spirited, horror, comedy, action film that, although obviously has lots of familiar genre staple moments, is, thankfully, not knowing, winking, referencing or particularly derivative of any one thing. The acting and direction are assured, the gore effects pleasingly devoid of CGI, the humour comes from a very real human place not a silly, contrived place and the tension is satisfyingly maintained throughout.The best praise I can give this film is that it is just solid, decent, well made entertainment, the kind we so rarely get to see and, while none of it is exactly, what you could call, a huge surprise, to the initiated, I still had a tremendously good time with the film. I laughed out loud, I jumped, I felt nervous and was, on occasion, sufficiently creeped out. I love that. So cool when a film can achieve that.The cast, across the board, are great in their roles with stand out mentions going to Barbara Crampton, of course, Joe Swanberg, AJ Bowen and a tour de force from Sharni Vinson as the kick ass heroine ready to fight back.The score and soundtrack, especially in the second half, is a sheer delight and was evocative of Goblin or Carpenter in just the right way.Apart from one scene of heightened panic the camera did not veer into amateurish shaky cam, thank goodness and, in fact, I loved the way the film was directed, shot and edited. It has definitely made me want to check out Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett's other work and keep a close eye on what they do in the future. There's not a lot of flourishes or showing off, just strong, simple, clear direction. Fantastic job.I can't urge people enough to go and see this in the theatre. A lot of talk is thrown around these days about how horror fans need to support new, independent horror and quit their complaining that there is nothing new and good out there. Well, seemingly, what horror fans actually end up doing, sadly, is throwing hard earned cash at remakes and then attacking anyone who says they don't want to see them because we shouldn't ""pre-judge"". Justify it how you like but you are throwing money at marketing companies who make a tenth rate, weak sauce, copy of a previous classic, with no care or understanding as to what made the original so charming and ingenious, slap the same name on it, throw it into cinemas and sit back to watch the coin come rolling in. One of the trailers before You're Next was the Carrie remake and oh dear oh dear oh dear that looks to be one of the most insipid, uninspired, pathetic looking, unoriginal and beige remakes yet. I think Carrie and Evil Dead are vying for the top spot of most redundant and pointless remake of 2013. The kicker is that, in the Carrie trailer, they even show, in slow-mo no less, the pigs blood at the prom scene and it's 'we-want-a-lower-rating-please' black. Sludgy, boring black. Imagine my absolute sheer, fan boy, delight then when You're Next starts and the blood is thick, gooey, vibrant RED! YES! Hallelujah! YES!So, please, GO SEE THIS FILM. NOW. Go and enjoy. This is what entertainment looks like. This is what new, independent, horror worth supporting looks like. Go out there, watch it and spread the word. Please. If the Carrie remake makes more than You're Next and if you bypass You're Next in the theatre but go and see Carrie, I don't care your excuse, you are a very very bad person and you should be utterly ashamed.",You're Next
227,coastin_on_a_dream,Could have been much better,4,16 January 2014,"While not a very original premise, this movie had some good things going for it:it had a cool set - the masks of the killers were actually pretty creepy - a large cast that could have played off of each other well, since they were all supposed to be family - the soundtrack, at times, was very good and creepy - The title, while cheesy, is actually quite fun and catchyUnfortunately, a weak script and some very bad acting squandered any sort of potential this movie had.I get this is a horror movie, and most horror movies are pretty light on character development, but that shouldn't excuse it. The character development was really bad. I didn't even know the names of over half of the cast because I couldn't tell them apart. Seriously, many cast members were just glorified extras, especially the first few people to die. The filmmakers couldn't have devoted like 5 more minutes of screen time to flesh out some of these characters? Guess not.Also...the acting in this movie was pretty bad. Some of them were decent, I guess, and obviously horror films don't really require academy-award winning performances, but I felt during the normal scenes at the beginning, many of the actors were sleepwalking through their lines. Their line deliveries were wooden and emotionless. They can scream and act scared, but they couldn't pull off simple small talk. There are so many actors out there in Hollywood looking for work, SURELY they could have found some better actors than the ones they picked?Another flaw of this movie was that it tried to balance horror and comedy. Some horror movies do this well, such as the Scream movies. This one did not. It wanted to be funny, but not too funny, because it wanted to be scary. And it wanted to be scary, but not too scary, because it wanted to be funny. The end result? Not really scary and not really funny. This movie was fairly entertaining because it did have some fun, brutal death scenes. It did not hold back on gore and was actually somewhat creative. Unfortunately, the plot twist wasn't much of a plot twist because I saw it coming. It was really predictable. When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it looked promising. The masks were really creepy. But this just ended up being an average, run-of-the-mill, forgettable home invasion flick. I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie really. It's not completely terrible, but it's not something you should really go out of your way to see. It's an okay movie to watch to pass the time if you're really bored, but that's about it.My rating: 4/10.The horror genre deserves better.",You're Next

I was bored and all I could think was is this the other half thinks about? Murdering their whole family because they didn't like them? I mean you have to be a real sociopath to just want to slaughter your whole family and their spouses. Innocent people that have nothing to do with how your family is screwed up and obviously these whiny individuals that hired killers to slaughter not only their family members but the damn neighbors. If that isn't sick and twisted then I don't know the definition of sick and twisted clearly. Maybe I clearly can't identify with this movie because I'm the wrong nationality but seriously if this is how people with money think then I'm better off staying in my tax bracket.

232,worshipthylouie,You're Next (2013) Review,6,8 January 2014,"This horror film was made for the movie theater. You know, the devour a large popcorn, drink some pop, kick back and have a good time type. If you are looking for something clever, well acted and sophisticated, You're Next is not that. This is action packed, blood and guts, without wasting much time with character development. Dubbed a horror comedy, you may laugh at some of the stupidity, and enjoy the revenge or slasher horror elements, but do not come looking for a film of the year candidate.A family gathers at their vacation home, and sit down for dinner. Midway through, an arrow bursts through the window killing one of them. Being hunted by men wearing creepy animal masks, the family must work together to survive despite being a tad bit dysfunctional.The plot is not original. You've seen this before in any other home invasion type film. However, I will give it a lot of credit for being insanely creative and fun with how the tables are turned on the criminals. To be honest, and I am sorry if you do not like my comparison, it kind of reminded me of a Home Alone for grown ups. The main protagonist, Erin (Sharni Vinson), set up traps and used methods that brought the pain to the villains when they opened the front door, or hopped through a window.I do not believe this film was meant to be taken all that seriously. I could criticize some of the ridiculous decisions characters made, or blabber about the nonsensical arguments they engaged in while their lives were at stake, but that would be pointless. The comedy element may be the excuse for that, so I will choose to ignore it.What I can complain about is the acting and dialogue. The majority of the actors and actresses I listed above, are not going to be familiar to most. This is because a fair bit of them are directors from low budget horror films. The only one who I can see having a successful career eventually is Sharni Vinson, who does an all around convincing, and exceptional job, as the girl who fights back.One wearing a fox mask (Lane Hughes), a tiger mask (Simon Barrett) and a lamb mask (L.C. Holt), the trio of murderers were scary enough to leave young children with nightmares. For those over 18, you might just find them very cool. Armed with crossbows, machetes, shotguns, and more, they provide very tough opposition for the family.The blood is splattered everywhere, and the special effects are graceful. Some very fine kills are in for folks who enjoy seeing the bad guys, or good kills, offed in the most unique ways possible. While some die in standard fashion, others are memorable, such as the death by blender. I really enjoyed this death scene, and even clapped a bit during it.Here is the bottom line, You're Next is undeniably entertaining. I love the slasher genre, and it makes me happy, but I never go into it, expecting the best movie ever. Mostly if it is one that will be shown in the theaters. With that said, I do feel like this could have been a lot better. Stronger actors, and script revisions, could have done it some justice. I do understand that it was not shot on a big budget, so I appreciate what it was. This film makes for a nice switch up from the ghosts or demons usually haunting the movie theater, and can provide a fun, ninety five, minutes to those interested.I will say that I would feel better about watching it on Netflix, or renting it than having to buy the DVD. It is not something I think needs more than one watch, but for horror fans, no need to avoid it all together. I am not going to say to seek it out either, but my point is, you would not regret watching it if it is in front of you.

Infact, the acting is extrmely poor, almost offending. The plot does not exist. Some dialogues are surreal in certain situations, like the one when the father is lying injured on the floor, others already dead, and he finds time and mental strenghth to argue with his son that he is an internet criminal just because he suggests some gadget to buy on Amazon (which was also without sense).

Did You're Next succeed?For the most part, yes. You're Next is a very fun film and it isn't designed be anything more, really. It's a gore-soaked, adrenaline- pumping film that borrows a few things from other horror movies.The best thing about this film is Sharni Vinson's character, who is a really intelligent, level-headed and bad-ass woman and that's a rare thing to find in horror films nowadays. A ton of horror films that come out are all terrified, stupid people who don't know how to react in the situation they're put in so they completely shut down. In You're Next, there's an actual struggle and fight going on between Vinson's character, Erin, and the serial killers. One bad thing about You're Next, though, is that it borrows from other horror films and I know that's very hard not to do but in the beginning, it feels generic. It all feels incredibly generic until the horror part kicks in and then the film is so intense and absorbing but even then, there are a few familiar elements in the mix.The director didn't find a great balance between dark comedy and serious, all-out horror but to me, that didn't matter that much. I like my horror films serious and I usually don't like them when there's a lot of goofy in the mix. I had a great time with this one because sometimes it doesn't take itself completely seriously but a lot of the time it does.You're Next is a very fun time and sure to please horror fans.

But while the movie's schema is completely typical, its execution—smart script, decent cast, solid direction by Adam Wingard—is exemplary.The major detail YOU'RE NEXT gets right is to provide actual motivation for both the villains' kill spree and for the heroine's ability to survive the abattoir (other than being yet another innocent virgin with gumption). This alone is enough to place the film at the pinnacle of its sub-genre. Moreover, director Wingard and screenwriter Simon Bennett demonstrate a talent for side-stepping annoying clichés. The assembled victims numbers ten instead of the usual half-dozen, with not one idiot teen in the lot; the squealing, screaming, helpless characters are winnowed out with audience-considerate dispatch so the more fit and bright can make the best of their situation. Meanwhile, refreshingly, the murderers are NOT portrayed as unstoppable killing machines until the final ten minutes: one even gets short of breath and needs a time- out! The pacing and shock effects are crisp; the moments of black comedy are sparingly, intelligently planted.

In fact, I don't see any comedy aspect to it at all. I don't even see any attempts at comedy. I think what happened here is that IMDb accidentally listed it as a comedy, and so everyone who saw the movie managed to find something funny in it just because they felt they were supposed to. Typical non-thinking drone behavior.Besides the comedy, the trailer makes it seems like it's gonna be a good, scary home invasion movie like The Strangers or Funny Games. Unfortunately though, there isn't anything scary about this. Every kill can be seen a mile away. Naturally there are also a few jump scenes which are once again extremely predictable. All of the ""suspenseful"" moments are cliché as can be.The entire middle of the movie is boring beyond belief. It's hard to give an example of something not being scary for obvious reasons. Just imagine masked guys running around this house doing some stuff that causes no reaction or emotion in you at all, and the people inside the house are screaming a lot. That's what the majority of the movie consists of.The only thing not making it a truly terrible movie is what happens towards the end. This part is good for two reasons. The first is that the movie is ending. The second reason is because there are two nice twists that I didn't see coming at all. It was nice also because I was tired of predicting everything else that happened before.I would probably put this in the drama, crime, and thriller genres. The only thing possibly qualifying it as horror is gore.Obviously I wouldn't recommend watching this, but if you'll be wasting any time on it at all it should be spent briefly reading about the ending somewhere.

Sharni Vinson is especially good as Erin.It's easy to invest in Erin as it quickly becomes apparent that she is an innocent bystander in a nightmare family environment. That is probably what makes many of the kills so satisfying. Of course Erin isn't the only killer and one other death in particular is very funny. I'm talking about the one in the basement for anyone who has seen the film.The effects are suitably bloody, mostly in a fun way but there are a few moments that made me wince.Overall I really enjoyed You're Next. The only thing I didn't like so much was the very last bit where the police man opens the door. Think I would have preferred Erin to just walk away.

What makes it worse is the fact that he couldn't decide on how to conclude the movie and so goes with the typical low-class horror movie ending where it ends with an unoriginal death scene that leaves the story somewhat open (with credits rolling straight after).You're Next really set a new level of low to the horror/thriller genre.

The film has all the qualities that a good slasher flick should have: suspense, jumps, large amounts of gore, and a tiny bit of humour. It starts much like most horror films, some unknown characters get brutally murdered, leading into the beginning of the main film. Simple effects like the music in this opening scene made it really stand out against many horror openings, and I was exited to see more straight from the start.The film continues where this opening scene left off, keeping the viewer in suspense until the motives of the masked men are revealed. At this point the film seems to change gear, becoming much more violent (before this part of the film much of the murders were not shown in their full gore), and in some cases mildly amusing. Although generally predictable, I was still left slightly guessing what might happen throughout the film.

256,crako1,SPOILERS - Not a good effort,4,26 August 2013,"This review contains spoilers.The movie starts with senseless murder - not necessarily bad for a horror movie ...but they keep right on with that as the theme into the second act. One house, then the second. Pointless slaughter.Someone outside the house is shooting at your dinner party? It should take half the film to realize you can close the curtains, shut off the lights, or wow, just ""stay low"".And really, how disaffected is your character that she chews gum at the dinner table while eating dinner? That's just stupid. (The blatant eye rolling would have sufficed.) We eventually learn there is a point, and that works out okay. But the writing and directing while waiting to get there is pretty hard to take. ""Oh no, we're under attack! I hated you when we were younger!"" and ""I'm going to take mom upstairs to get a nap"" are just not reasonable reactions for characters who are being killed.The killers wear masks which would make a terror spree hard to manage, and the reason for the masks is not ever explained. Could have gone for ski masks or hockey masks, maybe cameo paint, but no, bunny and wolf masks are in vogue, apparently, even if you can't see anything.One of the victims (and really, only one) has a brain - our hero. She fights and kills with a savagery that puts here a level above the killers. She gets a quality kill with a blender that makes my decision to not walk out, to see the end of the film, all worthwhile.A better script would have saved this movie. Make some references to other horror films. Give the characters brains - they are fighting for their lives, so they might actually try to work as a group. Allow for the random ""victim runs into killer"" scene where neither was prepared. DO SOMETHING that isn't boring.",You're Next

264,falcolnpunch,"Disappointingly, We're Next",5,1 September 2013,"You're Next is the latest Home Invasion Horror to grace our screens. From the off, instantly, we are welcomed by boobs and blood. And I do mean that, ""Welcomed"", because it doesn't feel like a horror movie has hit our cinemas with as much gusto as You're Next in a while. The story involves a family meeting for an overdue family gathering at your standard House In The Middle Of Nowhere, and after arguments at the dinner table our guests find that they happen to be trapped in the house by nutjobs in crude animal masks.Characters are offed fairly quickly in spectacular enough ways, whilst other - better - horror films are lovingly referenced throughout: Evil Dead, Straw Dogs, Halloween, Texas Chainsaw, The Shining... I could go on, there were lots - even a Home Alone-style trap is in there! It is just a shame that it really shows how weak the writing is for the ""human"" characters - as welcome as it is to not see horny teens in the central role of a horror, the dialogue for our family members really isn't much better than if they were. Empty replies like ""OK"" feel very standard and generic, which they obviously are supposed to be to show how normal and detached these people are, but all the same, before any arrows do eventually fly it really is quite a slow watch. And, like myself, you may actually find yourself wishing for these people to be killed off horrifically.I'm afraid this isn't the only problem though. After a fairly excellent and confident First and Second Act (A kill involving a Nikon is a highlight), the Third really does lose its footing as the Baddies reveal their motive. In a film like this, you don't really need to give your antagonists one and simple blind violence is suitably reliable in a film like this, but instead they're given this bland, overused motive which really just feels sluggish and tacked on last minute.Moving back to a positive, the soundtrack has to be mentioned. It sizzles without ever going over the top, and whilst managing to stay creepy and tense (a song stuck on constant repeat is both catchy and eerie), with the music in the last half hour accompanying murders and hide and seek with a brilliant synthesizer pumped Terminator-esque chase sequence.With an interesting start and middle filled with straight up villains (I wouldn't be surprised if we end up seeing any Trick Or Treaters with masks like these ones this Halloween) and fantastic death sequences this is still one of the better horror movies in a good while, only being let down by a disappointing end.@JonnyJonJon1",You're Next

You did get an idea of the personalities of the characters quite early on, which is good, as other films don't even try letting you know who anybody is, instead they are just there, that's it. The film moved along steadily, not stalling too much at any part, with enough people moving around, making their own decisions more as individuals than a group. There appears to be good tension in the house anyway, before things kick off and start getting ugly as well as surreal. It was filmed well too. There are aspects I didn't like, which affected total enjoyment of viewing, weakening the plot, but involves maybe saying too much about the story, so I'll keep these points to myself.

Some might position this as nothing but a ""Scream"" style rip off. Yes, it has some of those qualities but what moves this beyond those comedies is this movie is pretty vicious. The kill scenes are brutal and fun and the female hero'ish, sort of Sigourney Weaver'ish actress, just kills it and many people.

I don't know how and why I was intrigued to watch You're Next, and boy did I make the wrong choice there. First off, since when is the color of blood brown? I understand this is a low-budget film, and I am pretty sure the cost of making the blood's appearance at least half-real wouldn't have killed the making of the movie. Second, is it just me or was it too obvious that Felix, Zee, and Crispian were in on the ""plan"" ? While Felix and Zee display their emotionless behavior towards all surrounding events, Crispian, whose ""superhero"" girlfriend admits that he is not tough, decides to run outside and call for help, even after knowing his sister died the exact same way, and disappears until the end of the movie. I don't think it's considered a plot twist if the twist is overt, at least not to me. This goes without mentioning that all three sons could not care less for their mother's or sister's deaths. Long story short, I did not see anything original in this movie. I am no expert, but I do not believe it requires a high-budget film to make up a creative, well-executed plot. Having had additional effort put into performance and character development would have at least kept the audience with a tiny feeling of excitement throughout the film.",You're Next

279,millmat,A missed golden opportunity.,4,6 November 2013,"One of the most disappointing things about ""You're Next"" is that it has a lot of things going for it in the first half of the film that every good horror film should have; a great set-up, TWO intimidating antagonists, a brooding atmosphere, and, most importantly, brilliant scares. So how can anyone make a movie with so much potential built up for it, and make it so bad? I don't know, but they sure as hell succeeded.The movie is about a family who travels to Missouri for a reunion. During their stay, strange things start going on, and soon, they, you guessed it, are soon in danger of being murdered. By who you ask? Two mysterious figures wearing a sheep and wolf masks, and like all great horror villains, the creepiness of the figures makes you not care how silly the outfits may be. But if you don't mind me nitpicking, why couldn't they choose any scarier animal masks, like a pig or something like that. I think that that would have made it a whole lot scarier.But again, I'm just nitpicking.So why do I dislike this film. Well, the biggest problem with it has to be the acting. The scary scenes in the beginning for the most part. For 10 minutes, they're all just yelling at each other. During that time in the theatre, I kept asking myself, ""Am I watching a horror movie, or a Halloween special of 'Keeping Up With The Kardashians'?Around thing that the film has are a lot of plot holes. For example, earlier in a scene, they set a trap for the killer by putting barb wire near the opening of the door, and later, one of the male characters is decapitated by it while making a run for it. And these little things are everywhere! So it makes it really hard to take the film seriously.But is this there anything my pretentious little mind likes about this film? Yes, the scares. With just the right moments, just the right pacing and just the right pitch of the score, the scares in this film are amazing. It's a film that will leave you cringing in your seat. Another reason they work so well is the way they work off the scares with the films atmosphere and intimidating villains. But sadly, like a lot of horror films, the scares have to be set aside for the film's other element, like the so-called drama. And, like other scary movies, it just takes you off the hook.Then again, maybe I'm looking at this film the way that it's fan base looks at it. I mean, critics are always talking how much humor is in it. Maybe all the plot holes and hokey acting are what gives the film it's humor. Maybe it was trying to an unintentional spoof of horror movies. I don't know. I'd probably watch it again on Halloween or something like that, but if I were you, I'd wait for it to be out on video.",You're Next

Overall it was very well done and much better than I expected it to be, especially since it was an indie. Despite that, it had a very good production and the acting was very solid all the way around, especially by the lead actress. She was kick ass and I appreciated this. I actually had to look away a few times and I kind of got a sick feeling to my stomach, so I know that it is good because of that. To me, when a movie can bring out emotions like that it is the sign of a good movie. Other movies of the same genre didn't have as much of an impact as this did. I credit the very good direction, sound, production values, and quite good acting.

You're Next pushes way past that line of entertainment and ventures into this realm of being severely obscure just for the sake of being obscure. It is not art and it certainly isn't creative. They took things to a level I could never even imagine. It is nothing but pure evil and shock value. I am very offended that movies like this are being made and shown to people at all. It is disgusting, revolting, degrading, and insults it's viewers intelligence. The movie stirs up emotions of hate, betrayal, anger, fear, and psychosis. Nobody is going to feel good or be entertained by this one because it takes an absolute mad man to even think up such a concept. We have overstepped our limits when trash like this is allowed to even be produced. I feel like certain guidelines need to be set in place to prevent filmmakers from continuing to produce such garbage. You're Next would be an example of what should not be allowed if guidelines are ever enforced. Nothing good comes out of this. The filmmaker has lost his mind.

296,AdaMadaPia,Talent Skips A Generation,8,20 February 2018,"Or so the saying goes. This film is a perfect example of that.At first we're led to believe that the people attacking this family are masked strangers, but we soon learn that this is a money grab attempt. We have Paul and Aubrey Davison, two successful people who have done well for themselves and their children. They are kind, generous, loving folks who welcome their now grown kids as well as their significant others into their home to celebrate their wedding anniversary.Personally, the blood and gore are nowhere near as gut-wrenching (pun intended) as the premise. Children who grew up with privilege and with warm, supportive parents, yet lack their talent and charisma and are failing miserably at life. It's absolutely sickening to me that these now adult children went so far as to plan these murders ahead of time in the hopes that the police would believe the killers were random strangers so that they would inherit their parents' money.These children lack so little humanity, it's difficult to believe they weren't adopted. After they murder their sister's boyfriend and then their sister, they brutally murder their own mother in her bed while she's devastated over her daughter's death.After they take out their father, the inevitable happens: They turn on each other. Not surprising after the way these grown men behaved before the killings. Spoiled and whiny, generally unlikable people which leads me to wonder what Erin ever saw in Crispian.So we have a group of wonderful people gathered together in what is supposed to be an enjoyable family event, but they are cut down in their prime by those they trusted most. For greed. All in all, I really enjoyed this film and its deeply troubling theme that leaves you wondering who you can trust when those you love turn on you. Coupled with the extremely satisfying ending where Erin delivers some much overdue justice, I give this film an 8 out of 10. The characters are very believable and the actors did a good job in their execution (pun intended). It had enough suspense and the element of surprise to keep me on the edge of my seat and I love the complexity of the villains, instead of the cookie cutter slashers of many films in its genre. I think what gets me the most about this particular film is that there is no tragic backstory on the villains' part. No catastrophic events that brought them to this point. It's simply the deeply flawed nature of the human condition.",You're Next

That being said, this is one of my favorite recent action films. The actions of the protagonist are pretty satisfying to watch in an old timey flawless victory sort of way in the sense that everything seems fluid, natural, and wonderfully executed. The action is strong, and the suspense that builds is good if not somewhat inconsistent throughout the narrative.The part that really turned me on the most was the use of purposeful dialogue and actions once the set up portion of the film is done. It's very much a Chekov's gun sort of situation in which the economy of film means each clue and detail is important in at least some minor way later on, if not at the least good indicators of the rules and guidelines of the universe the movie's set up for us.This can range from snares and weapons, to how sturdy some of the characters are.

The only excuse for this is if they were actually trying to make some of the characters purposely funny. The actors lack of quality made this even harder to interpret. They managed to create a house full of unbelievable characters. Towards the end I felt like I was watching home alone meets scary movie. Very poor show. The plot also lacked depth, at the end we don't fully understand how what has happened, happened. There were so many moments that were laughable.

In Cabin in the Woods, it was supposed to be not your average story, and it really wasn't, which is why i love it. This one not so much.

I have been waiting for quite some time for the re-release of this film since its initial release in 2011. I was particularly interested in watching this movie since I grew up in Columbia, MO and was hoping for a little more of the rural country side and surrounding areas in the filming. However, back to the main topic the movie. The first half of the movie is slow and messy and my initial reaction was disappointment, but towards the end you realize why and I will not reveal any spoilers. Having said that it still doesn't work, this is no Frontier(s), Eden Lake or Martyrs. This movie is more Americanized, with a little bit of comic relief here and there. The worst factor about this movie is the thought process of the characters, there decision making skills like many B horror movies is ridiculous and You're Next is no exception to the continuous stupidity and decisions that most of the characters in the movie make. The really strange thing about this movie is it completely redeems itself towards the second half. It was as if the creators finally realized what they were doing. The music is well done, reminded me of House of Devil, but jumps around with little synergy. The camera shots were also well done, and the use of slow motion was surprisingly effective. There is no shortage of gore for a major theatrical release and the twists towards the end work in harmony with the story. The best feature of this movie is the protagonist that steps up, and it follows the current trend of recent protagonists in horror movies to a T. As a horror movie fan I enjoyed watching this movie, but it could have been great, but at the same time it could have been a lot worse.

When this little gem was in my ""What to Watch"" section on my Netflix feed, il be honest it sparked my interest. First, the beginning of the film started off with little to know character development, thus not feeling sympathy for the ones who get killed. Second, it seemed that there was a little too much convenience in the story which is something i personally don't enjoy. On a good note, i think many of the shots plus the color pallet made the film quite unique. I didn't seem like the typical ""Horror film released in January"" type pile of garbage if you understand where im going. The overall twist at the end was indeed satisfying, once the plot further explains why and what exactly they are doing.

Two opportunities were made to show the women's breasts, however,we have a man in a shower, and yet, there was no grab to have equal opportunity objectifying. Just for the record, women like sexuality too. Equality to both....",You're Next

335,andypapier,Worth watching with lowered expectations,6,31 December 2013,"I read such great things about this movie a couple of years ago and almost saw it in the theaters, but I'm not a huge fan of ""family trapped in the house"" horror. Finally seeing it I am somewhat disappointed mainly because of the overwhelmingly great reviews. SPOILER ALERT. The set-up was pretty well done however I knew right off the bat that someone in the family would be in on it, and it was pretty obvious who. Most annoying were the ridiculous decisions by family members once the assault began. I know these people are lame and bad decisions are normal in horror but come on. How about closing the curtains and blocking the windows once arrows start flying through (which you'll notice seems to to be the only way anyone/thing gets in yet are left open throughout the movie)? Nope, instead everyone uses chairs as shields. WTF? And why the hell are they all trying to go to the other side of the room anyway? Then EVERYONE agrees to let the hysterical/insecure daughter run out the FRONT door to make a run for the car!!!! I would think that killers skilled enough to use crossbows are probably wise enough to make the cars undrivable. No matter what, just blindly running out the FRONT door seems like a really, really, really bad idea. Even the biggest idiot might question this. When things finally settle down (you know being attacked by crossbow ax wielding killers usually has it's down time) dad decides to put mom to bed!!! And UPSTAIRS!!! AND then leaves her to check on the kids who are grown adults!!!! What? You don't know who/what/why or where these attacks happening yet you leave your wife alone in room in a giant house that is under attack by crossbow killers??? Although I must say this did throw me somewhat and make me suspicious of pops. Anyway, decisions and silly plot devices like this go on throughout. I'm hoping this is just part of the ""comedy"" of the film which becomes even more ""comedic"" after the predictable twist reveal. Overall though the movie was well directed, did have some ""funny"" moments, great ambient music (70s/Italian style synth) lots of Refn style head smashing and a pretty good last twist. The movie seems to be an homage and derivative of various films/genres. With sprinklings of A. Christie, Ozploitation, torture porn, foreign flare (High Tension, Refn), trapped/invasion movies (Them, Assault on Precinct 13, No Vacancy, Funny Games), any horror movies with animal masks and horror heroine driven slashers. Though not scary or shocking enough to be a great horror film, nor amusing or over the top enough to be a cult flick, it is plenty entertaining and worth watching with lowered expectations.",You're Next

It is quite entertaining. It has good pacing. But most of all, the main character is a bad ass. I loved some of her ideas. One thing that infuriates me with horror movies is how stupid all the characters are. However I found most of the characters' reactions realistic. Perhaps a few stupid stunts here and there, but nothing to take away from the overall movie. On a scale from 0 to 10 (10 being Saw), I'd rate the goriness about a 7.5.

340,JakexHorror,Don't go see this Next,3,29 August 2013,"Having watched this last night, I can say I was bitterly disappointed. The trailer looked awesome, with its haunting score and the people in the masks looked somewhat discomforting. However after watching I can say I left feeling rather underwhelmed to say the least. The film starts quite positive and within five minutes we are treated to the first graphic killing spree. However after this is somewhat falls apart, with plot holes appearing all over the place, the story simply falls apart. Characters are introduced in rapid succession and you can never truly get a chance to connect with them. The film follows the somewhat familiar home invasion story. A family moves into a new house with the plan of renovating it to serve as their retirement home. Shortly after footsteps are heard upstairs, can you see where this is going? The whole family gather in the house I think there was 8 of them in total. There is obvious tension between two of them, I suppose at this point we were supposed to gather that there are long standing issues amongst the family members, but not to worry you never hear of this. It's at dinner the killing starts and ultimately where the film begins to fall apart. Armed with Crossbows, arrows start flying, and the blood starts flowing. However this is as good as it gets, you simply don't feel anything for the characters getting killed, seriously at some points it was actually laughable. Most of the guests begin panicking and running amok however it is hear that we learn that the one of the guests is a Rambo-esque heroine who has been brought up as a survivalist. Whereas the other guests run scared she begins setting up home-alone style traps for the attackers who she knows will clearly come into the house, even though they have crossbows and hidden behind masks, makes sense right? But not to worry the attackers are so dumb they actually enter the house one by one and are picked off by the heroine. It's in the closing act that we learn that two of the brothers are in on the scheme to kill the family and collect the inheritance and the entire family estate. At this point though you'll be so seriously disconnected from the film you will be begging for it to end. All in all it had potential but falls flat on its face. 3/10 – Go see it at your own peril.",You're Next

351,raoulpeltier,Innovative and gore-filled gem,9,8 July 2013,"""You're Next"" is a home invasion/survival film in the vein of ""Funny Games"", ""The Strangers"" or again ""The Last House on the Left"". As in the latter cited, you'll find here the usual bunch of people being assaulted by strangers in a remote house. In that ""You're Next"" brings no novelty, bu does a great job at delivering the great tension and suspense associated with this specific genre of horror. Where the film truly excels, is that it adds some really clever elements of crime and comedy to the genre, making it really unique. The film does a fantastic job at giving you true/false hints about who could be involved in the invasion; and you really spend an hour wondering if it's true and who could it be, just like in these great Italian giallo. Second, the film, which starts on a serious tone, gradually and subtly incorporates comedy elements in it. Towards the end it is hilarious, but never overrated or absurd, keeping the film on the horror track at all time. There is also great deal of gore in the film, and gore-hounds will find their lot of brutal kills. The main actress, and the character she plays, also needs to be mentioned for she is, at the image of the movie, a real bad-ass! You're Next is both true to the genre and innovative.

The acting is terrible across the board and some of the line readings are downright painful. The characters are clichéd and act in idiotic and totally unbelievable ways. The plot makes no sense. The villains plan is completely ridiculous, unnecessarily complicated and would never work. The movie also lacks any excitement or suspense.

The story then proceeded to tell us who the main protagonists where ruining all suspense and leaving me a wee bit flat. Before long I assumed that I was watching anadult ""home alone"" with the main character creating traps for the murderers, whose masks where becoming quite funny by this point. The movie concluded with a twist that I had already guessed once they had stopped showing what had happened to that character and decided to leave us with one more death that didn't scare anyone at all.

For me, nothing they did seemed too unrealistic, although leaving the mom in a room by herself is an exception. Several reviews have said the scene where one of the masked men steps on the board with nails makes no sense because he saw the nails. That's simply untrue. He only saw the one board, not the one he stepped on. Erin planned it that way. She put one board farther from the window so he would see it and think he could avoid it easily. She put the other one directly under the window, out of his line of sight so he would step on that one instead. It was smart. While it's a story that has been done before, I didn't find it cliché at all. There were victims of all ages, not just hot teenage girls, and the killers had actual motive. The acting was hit-and-miss, but most of the cast did a fine job, namely Vinson and Swanberg. This is an enjoyable horror/thriller.

I haven't truly been ""startled"" since The Ring (2000). That means, for 13 years, I've been satiated. What's missing in these movies is that psychological aspect from earlier films: ""Who's doing this?""/""Why?""/""Is there just one killer?"" Now, instead of questions, we have statements: ""The killer will be right behind them.""/""The killer is -insert obvious suspect here-.""/""He's going to die next."" This brings me to You're Next.

Adding some twists, some gore and an ironic end, makes this movie a good surprise in the horror genre that lately lacks in good quality movies. I recommend it 100% for the horror fans and not only and it deserved in my opinion a big publisher company to properly promote this movie.",You're Next

374,snobbyarc,good enough,6,5 November 2021,"All in all a mediocre movie, but i had a very fun time watching it, I would say it slowly developed into an action movie more than horror in most parts which can be kind of jarring when your trying to set a tone. I loved the killers designs and the little tiny bits and details about their past it gives them history and depth. The movie did get very campy in the end, how trained army vets who do killing for a living get merced by a college girl will always not sit well with me. Would have been more horror/thriller esk if it were a game of cat and mouse with her and the killers but all in all a good watch.",You're Next
375,syprez,If I want everything you have...You're Dead!,5,3 September 2013,"You're Next deserves all the hype that the film has been firmly surrounded by. The clever combination from a thriller, along with exceptional scores of creepy music, I remained genuinely freaked out. The griping emotions on some of the cast were enough to make me feel as if this movie was certainly possible in real life. Meshing, hate with greed and violence with torture, I found this Summer slasher to contain the right amounts of gore for the avid horror fan, while maintaining a great amount of calm moments to give those with a weak stomach a break well deserved. I often wonder how many movies are based on actual events, I can honestly say, that with this one...the possibility of such an occurrence having happened already (at least more than once, or on a smaller scale) should not be ruled out. I've heard of people pushing some twisted efforts to rival this movie, so the possibility of what has happened here shouldn't be taken lightly.The first few minutes of this slasher leave you with more questions than answers, as the screen play lingers on, you start making assumptions of what the conclusion will be. While the snap and crackle of bone and the blood spillage commences later on in the film, it surprisingly offers a smart twist, which to be honest I saw coming from a mile away. With the twisted figured out already, I felt a slight annoyance, however a followup twist in the story, will surely leave you with a gaping in ""Ahh"" moment.",You're Next

377,CarsonH1,Best Slasher Film of 2013!,10,2 September 2013,"I have been waiting to see this film ever since 2011. When I finally got to see it at the midnight premiere I loved it! From then I saw it 2 more times. The film starts out with a couple having intercourse, when they finish the man takes a shower and the woman goes downstairs to get a drink... Alone. After a series of odd events, both of these people don't end up... Well making it past the first scene. Then we cut to a older couple heading to their huge summer house isolated in the woods for a family reunion with their four kids and the kids four wives, boyfriends and girlfriends. When night falls things get ugly and people start to end up dead one by one. At the first attack scene in the dining room you first see Erin's (Sharni Vinson) act out in a unique manner, as she steps in as a hero and more or less saves lives. Through out the movie you get an explanation and viewing of her retaliation and techniques. Without her in the movie, this movie would be a regular, cliché slasher film. But thankfully, she is in it and pretty much makes the movie. Pretty much no other character gets any action except one of the brothers girlfriends, Kelly (Margaret Laney) who for some reason was my favorite character next to Erin. Maybe it was because she was smart enough to book it outside, even though not everything worked out for her.But overall I give this film a rating of 9 out of 10 as it really is a good film and I do urge you to go see it as it would make a fun viewing with your friends or even on a a date night. Plus their's not tons of gore in it and it's not squeamish to watch, plus their's tons of comedy which is nice.",You're Next
378,dj-devereux,"Peckinpah would be proud of this, I think?",7,29 January 2014,"The not so subtle title pretty much sums up the film, this is however not such a predictable slasher film as its been marketed, but more of a indie neo-Peckinpah ode to the everyday man (well woman) refusing to be a victim and fighting back (wither that be against masked killers or sexist stereotypes/prejudices of the common female victimisation in slasher films).The film is directed by prince of the underground horror scene Adam Wingard; who has made his name from his segments in both horror ciné-mix-tapes V/H/S & The ABC's Of Death. Wingard has made a film that challenges the perspective and mantra of the standard horror film, cleverly mixing violence with comedy and even some unpredictable plot twists.You're Next was completed way back in 2011 and was a smash at TIFF, but was not picked up and distributed by Lionsgate until 2013. Mr. Wingard described his film as ""I think we're coming out of the age of horror films where I think people are tired of being punished by violence and so forth. While You're Next is a super violent film, we approach it completely differently.""I feel this statement is just, yet from what I have seen, I feel instead of a regurgitated Wes Craven ode to horror, this film has taken influence from more of a Hitchcock realm, as this film does give our Killers a motive instead of mindless murder for thrills, but ultimately is a disciple from the CinéChurch of Peckinpah.Using violence as a lubricant to the narrative, this film has that raw video-nasty ethics, including some gruesome violence, the casual nudity and the one of two dodgy pieces of dialogue; However You're Next also nods to the cinematography of Lars Von Trier's Dogme docu-style. Difficult & debatable to summarise this film as Art or Exploitation? The film I would say is not a ""Horror film"", but a ultra-violent stage-play, 6 actors, one set etc, very theatrically laid out. This film is entertaining & border line satire, the pace of the film is surprisingly slow during the anticipated siege of the house, but the 1st & 3rd acts were we are introduced to who & what is about to happen flows perfectly.You're Next will be ideal for those who love the films of Peckinpah, Fredkin & Hitchcock, with a pinch of Von Trier & a dab of Craven, making this a recipe which at first glimpse, deceptively appears to be a B-Exploitation Picture, however it does mature into a layered drama with a insidious agenda behind it.",You're Next

381,jackcarlin,horrorfocus.blogspot.co.uk,10,1 September 2013,"You're Next is a lot of things, and one of them not being the ground- breaking home-invasion it was initially made out to be. Don't get me wrong, this is a great film, but its short of being a masterpiece and way off in terms of being ""ground-breaking"", there is nothing wrong with that in the slightest. With its confident approach, it knows what it is, it sticks to the conventions adding it's own personality and it works; You're Next is a well-made, tense and confident new entry into the home- invasion and slasher sub-genre's alike.Perhaps having high hopes isn't the best way to go into You're Next, nor is knowing a lot about the film as a lot of moments may come and go without the element of surprise which were perhaps explained in the synopsis, seen in a review or in the trailers; That's what it was like for me at times, I knew what was coming, when it was coming, but other than that, it's a shocker. The element of surprise never falls short, and as the bodies start to pile the surprises get bigger and better. The explanation for the killing may not be top notch, but it's a decent reason to get the gore going, and who cares really, if it's an excuse to get people die in horrible fashions then so be it.The gore is perhaps the best part of You're Next, and without trying to give anything away, there are a few deaths that are so great you wonder why it hasn't been done before. The blood comes in bucket fulls and the comedy comes pitch black, You're Next knows how to get the horror buffs up and involved and the casual movie fans egging the action on. It's more of a movie fans type of movie, and less of a casual film-goer flick, it's filled to the brim with nods and winks to previous horrors that established the sub-genre, and although it's quite clichéd exterior may be viewed straight-up to the normal movie folk, every horror fan should be able to identify what lies beneath You're Next, and that 'more than meets the eye' exterior is something too good to spoil.Sure, the gore and gags is a strong factor of You're Next, but what really made the film as good as it was, was the kick-ass heroine that was Erin, played by the brilliant Sharni Vinson. Erin starts off as a cute, playful character with the healthiest of personalities, but once the arrows start to fly she becomes an unstoppable fighting machine who knows exactly what to do when jammed in a horrible situation. To put it simply, she's great, so great that she may possibly be the best woman in horror of all time (behind Ripley from Alien obviously). Though the performances from Vinson, Swanberg and Tucci are top notch, some of the cast seem to struggle when presenting their characters, delivering a couple of wooden moments for their characters. In saying this, most of the cast are able to pull their weight and deliver the appropriate performance, and despite a lack of character development for some, they still do a pretty good job.More jumpy and tense then scary and nerve-shredding, You're Next knows exactly what it is, what it wants to do and does it with complete success. Despite it's lack of fast action that was once promised by critics, it was still a hugely fun flick. Between the wacky deaths, black humor and final kitchen scene, You're Next is a massively entertaining horror film that is sure to be one of the best times at the cinema you will have all year. In fact, You're Next is all about the fun factor, and Wingard and Barrett know exactly how to make a great horror movie experience that can fit perfectly into the sub-genre whilst managing to inject a breath of fresh air into it without adjusting the rules. To put into perspective, just imagine The Strangers and Scream combined.Battling with a Carpenter/Craven-esque feel to it, both visually and with the score, You're Next makes for a visually impressive, synthesize scored thrill ride that will get your heart racing and your pulse pounding. It does for the home-invasion sub-genre what Scream did for the slasher sub-genre, though it isn't anything we haven't seen before, it's so unbelievably fun that none of that matters by the time ""You're Next"" splashes up before the end credits. With the Scream vibe and the Carpenter/Tron score, this film barely misses a mark, and as a horror, especially of the slasher type, it's very rare to find. The score is absolutely phenomenal, it isn't the conventional fast-paced slasher theme that normally accompanies these type of movies, and instead is a more of an 80's synthesized score that feels as if Tron and Halloween clashed; as strange as it sounds, it's funky, fresh and surprisingly effective; so don't even get me started on 'Looking for the Magic' because believe me, you will be singing it long after the film has ended.The comedy comes pitch black and works in the benefit of the horror, Wingard's ability to quickly shift gear between horror and comedy is impressive, and to be able to execute a witty joke straight after a death is ingenious. One seen in particular that involves the full cast around the dinner table is great to watch and will surely make what happens next a huge U-turn in mood. The character of Drake is great when it comes to delivering the snappy humor, and the bicker between him and Crispian is funny yet slightly uncomfortable to watch. The humor remains strong until the very end, and along with the many twists and turns, guts and gore, the comedy always remained intact (especially in a particular blender scene, it was great). What can I say, You're Next made for a great time at the cinema.",You're Next
382,TheSquintyEyeball,"""It may take a while to make this up to you...""",7,31 January 2014,"The format of the stalk and slash horror movie has been established for decades. The majority of entrants flog the same clichés over and over to the point where regular visitors to the world of the slasher can piece the puzzle in minutes. Someone searches the house without switching on the lights. A person, usually a girl, traps themselves upstairs or runs through a wood before eventually tripping over and meeting their end.You're Next starts with plenty of these old clichés. From characters such as the average Girl-Next-Door, the edgy, goth one and the usual obvious machete fodder, through to jumps and bumps in the creepy house and POV cuts of someone being watched, unawares. There is plenty here to make you think you have seen this film a hundred times before.Refreshingly, however, you haven't.The movie starts as any other slasher would. Setting the scene and making sure you know that people are going to die. Over the space of it's 95 minutes You're Next builds up a generous body count with a mixture of kills ranging from standard through to amazingly creative. One method of self defence in particular, will have you pondering the more obscure uses for your kitchen appliances should masked murderers ever invade your home.After a fairly poor start with some fairly wooden acting, the kills start coming and the film becomes something different entirely. The actions of one character come as a surprise not only to the viewer but also to every other character in the film.The action quickly switches back and forth between tense cat and mouse to sudden bursts of violence. The background plot carries along and, to be honest, it does quickly becomes quite obvious as to what is going on here. After a while, it becomes enjoyable to just sit back and watch the whole thing unfold.There is, however, always that pleasant feeling that there may be another surprise around the corner meaning that boredom never gets the chance to set in. The quick pace and ample running time, means that the film never overstays it's welcome.Home and Away and Step Up 3D actress, Sharni Vinson plays her role very well and the rest of the acting is reasonable for movie like this. The best scenes though are the ones when nobody is actually saying anything. The music is interesting and changes, like the rest of film to fit in with the feel, from swirling strings to 80's synths. The violence is mildly slapstick and the gore, while quite excessive, never becomes particularly OTT or ridiculous considering the type of film this is. You're Next quite happily keeps it's feet on the booby trapped ground.You're Next comes across as a good nod to the classic killer pictures of the 80's and the teen slashers of the early 90's. In a further hint towards a film for the fans, Re-Animator and From Beyond actress Barbara Crampton features, looking great, now in her mid 50's. House of the Devil and Innkeepers director, Ti West also features in a cameo that helps kick off proceedings with a thump.There's definitely nothing here to make You're Next a classic, but it should be commended for being a solid attempt at doing something a little different.",You're Next

No need for a synopsis because it doesn't really matter. There are some minor twists and turns along the way, but again, they don't really matter either. This isn't revolutionary filmmaking, it's a B-horror movie that got a wide release, and I'm glad for it. After all the ridiculous torture-porn or M. Night Shmamalanian-esque attempts at shocking us with grand revelations, it's actually kind of refreshing to watch a horror movie where people are just scared and getting killed. It also features tour-de-force performance by Sharni who gets my vote for baddest bitch in a horror movie since Ripley or Sydney Prescott. If you're looking for a fun, violent horror movie and a gorgeous Australian ninja goddess to root for, You're Next (idiotic title aside) isn't a bad way to spend 1.5 hours.

389,dreece13-660-931259,"Starts good, lets you down hard",4,17 January 2014,"You're Next was advertised as a horror film with a twist. There is a twist, and that's that one of the dinner guests is some BA survivalist. The movie starts out nicely with the traditional first kills before the rather empty story starts out. They get to the house, hear some noises but only glance around one room before shrugging their shoulders, and head back downstairs. They hear noises again and ignore them. As you could probably guess, someone was in the house. During dinner they start getting killed, and this is where it drops off HARD.One of the biggest peeves of mine in a horror film is when characters are stupid. If you just watched someone get shot in the forehead by an arrow, would you stand in front of the window trying to help them? No, a trained person would drag them away from the window carefully, and an untrained person would instinctively stay away from the damn window so they don't get killed either. Of course, another person gets shot through the window. This is just the beginning of the stupidity, which goes on to the most terrified character going upstairs to lay down in bed ALONE, before getting killed. The idiocy culminates in the hands down stupidest death I've ever seen in a movie that obviously takes itself somewhat seriously: the mastermind behind the whole plan gets a blender slammed into his skull, which is then turned on and grinds up his brains, killing him.If you go into this movie with any expectations of a unique horror, you'll be disappointed like I was. Had I known how big of a joke this film would've ended up being, well, I honestly wouldn't have watched it.

395,ltenhage,"Done Before, Cliché -- Cool Masks Though.",2,24 August 2013,"You're Next had an excellent trailer that in some ways misled me as a moviegoer. It had a combination of brooding elements, what appeared to be good characters, and Lou Reed's ""Perfect Day"" which gave it all a terrifying effect. All of these qualities the movie sorely lacked.First, the characters. There were too many introduced in a short amount of time. Ten to be exact. They were largely forgettable. I found myself not caring about any of them and rooting for the antagonists. I feel none of the characters received enough camera time to establish sympathy with the audience. And when they did receive screen time, the scenes usually featured other people, all of whom were usually screaming and/or talking over one another, making things very disorienting.Second, the movie takes on the common slasher movie structure -- the group of people in a house, and the killer who comes in, and well, you can guess. The main problem I have with slasher movies is their monastic fixation on killing. And nothing but killing. Usually they forgo strong characters or themes and rely on cheap thrills (a la Rob Zombie). However, most of the time, the one redeeming element of slasher movies is a brooding and mysterious and cool antagonist. Halloween has Michael, Nightmare On Elm Street has Freddy, but who does You're Next have? No one. Well not really. The killers in the movie started off brooding and mysterious but in time, the movie managed to ruin whatever was scary about them. This caused the movie to no longer be scary, but just a practice in ""look at these ways of killing people I thought up of!"". And not very interesting ways at that.However, the one thing I did enjoy about the movie was the killers' masks. Those were real cool. They were also featured in the trailer. Other than that, there were very few highlights. And I feel that the problems of this movie are symptomatic of much of the slasher movies released today. They feel that just because they're slasher movies they don't need to be good movies with good character or themes. Well,I'm sorry. I like good movies. Maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it.",You're Next

397,austin-bedoy,"""You're Next"" attempts to refresh the home-invasion genre. And it succeeds brilliantly!",9,4 September 2013,"Home invasion stories have played a pivotal role in the progression of horror films for quite some time now. However, home invasion films don't necessarily have to be pure horror movies. Some just want to entertain, more than scare. Adam Wingard's latest horror-thriller film ""You're Next"" wants to do just that.If you're not familiar with ""You're Next"", let me just start off by saying that this film is actually a two year-old and independently made film, that first premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in 2011 and had since rose to critical acclaim, with many critics mentioning the films refreshing tone in the horror genre. After the film festival, the rights were suddenly purchased by Lionsgate and the film was, mysteriously, shelved for two years. I'm going to mention that ""You're Next"" is more of a thriller than it is a horror movie. (It just has some horror aspects to it) So if you're going into this only expecting to be scared, then don't bother with this film. Go watch ""The Conjuring"" instead if you haven't seen that already. Now, on to the review: PLOT: The plot for ""You're Next"" is fairly simple, but it's more interesting that you'd expect. Even if the film first seems like your average run-of-the-mill horror film. This is how the story goes:""When a gang of masked, ax-wielding murderers descend upon the Davidson family reunion, the hapless victims seem trapped... until an unlikely guest of the family proves to be the most talented killer of all."" So why is ""You're Next"" interesting? Well, like the synopsis says, things switch gears once everything starts happening, as that certain unlikely guest shows her ""talents"" from get-go. And I will say, that twist was truly unexpected! That one twist alone is what makes this film so unique and refreshing compared to your everyday run-of-the-mill horror film. In other horror films, there may have been leading ladies that have attempted to attack their killer, but they usually scream and run off after their first strike and end up not knowing what their going to do next. This certain lead, however, knows exactly what to do once the carnage ensues! And she wants these killers dead, and will stop at nothing until they are all dead! She sets traps, commences sneak attacks, and even fights the killers head-on! This certain character may very well be the best female lead yet, and unlike many other female leads in other countless horror films, we are truly invested in her survival! There are some other neat aspects to the plot of ""You're Next"" than just it's fantastic leading lady though. I think it's cool that the killers are humanized instead of just being our same-old mindless, killing machines without personality like we've seen a hundred times before! These killers also have a real motive for attacking this certain family. The killers are smart too, as they employ many cool strategies in order to kill their victims as fast as possible, like using trip wires and a cell phone jammer! (Though they did forget to count on one thing... our leading lady!) Even with some predictable plot twists, the story of ""You're Next"" is still head-above-shoulders compared to many other films in it's genre!ACTING: This is a low-budget film, so you can kind of expect the acting to be a little mediocre. And it is for the most part. The somewhat mediocre acting may ward off some viewers, although I, myself, forgive the acting, considering the fact that this film is low-budget and independently made. I mean, you can't expect to get great actors if your film is on a low budget and have no help from a studio.CINEMATOGRAPHY: The cinematography is excellent, with many cool and creepy shots through-out! Cinematographer Andrew Palmero took a lot of time and effort into shooting this film, as he really shows us his talent behind the camera. The only downside to his work is that the camera is slightly unsteady at times. A minor problem, but it would have been nice if he could of maintained a little more self-control.SCRIPT: The scriptwriting is absolutely brilliant! The dialogue is believable, the use of dark humor is effective and times in just right, and believe it not, this films does contain a lot of logic and reasoning. (With the exception of a couple scenes) It may not be apparent at first, but the logic is there.EDITING: There's not much to be said about editing. The only thing that comes to mind is that it would have been nice if the film could pay more attention to a few scenes, but Adam did state in an interview that he couldn't focus too much on certain scenes since because the budget wasn't big enough. Well, gotta keep within the budget, I guess.SOUNDTRACK: ""You're Next"" contains a cool 80's style electronic score that always times in at the right moment. The score fits the mood of the film, and to every situation that's going on! A truly great score, I thought.CONCLUSION: ""You're Next"" is a film destined for cult-classic status, as it's surely a crowd-pleaser! It's one of those rare horror films that actually succeeds in what it's trying to do: to entertain! Adam Wingard never wanted to scare his audiences, he only wants to entertain! And he succeeds brilliantly! So do yourself a favor, and go watch ""You're Next""! If you love home-invasion films, and can forgive the films faults, I promise that you will not be disappointed!",You're Next

And I found myself loosing track of characters and who they were.However, the plot twists were very enjoyable, I did love the idea, and the ending did make me wonder what will happen next.

The plot is extremely dull, there is no character development or mystery. The interaction between the characters is artificial and really kills any chance to preserve some credibility. There are very few startling moments, the suspense never reaches the desired level nor is there a climax at any moment that makes the viewers feel any emotion besides regret for time and money wasted. The non-stop gore scenes are well shot and of high quality but fail to have an impact as the plot barely develops, making the movie just a dull sequence of ongoing carnage without a clear purpose. The actors were extremely unconvincing, except for the leading female character Erin, played by Sharni Vinson, who was alright. I lost interest half way through the movie and started wishing I would get killed as well to end the horror of having to be subjected to this failure of a movie.",You're Next
401,gmh7777,"I was duped by the trailer, don't make the same mistake!",3,1 September 2013,"Like the next man I enjoy a good killing. However the carnage that unfolds in 'You're Next' is quite frankly a cinematic mess. I went for the standard injection of blood, jumps and tension implied in the trailer which evidently were secondary to the vapid plot and arrogant attempt at humour. Even if the comedy is accepted as an annoying imposition on the film, the ridiculous comic lines were dropped awkwardly throughout and the dialogue in general was impotent and uncomfortable.At various and drawn out parts of the film the camera work is extremely shaky. Yes the idea is to get the viewer in on the action but I'm not talking about Cloverfield shaky, more like fit inducing shaky. If the fact that the cameras are disorientating, the characters don't gel or bounce off each other, the relationships are bereft of any kind of chemistry, the jumps are unimaginative while the very odd choice of music destroys any kind of potential mounting tension are all just a subtle type of horror spoof humour, well it certainly beat me..The one redeeming quality is Sharni Vinson who puts in a shift as a 'horror heroine' in this comic farce. Other than that I am in disbelief of how bad this film was and how highly rated it is on IMDb. I wanted an easy to watch gore flick and out spewed a baffling stab at entertainment.",You're Next

The acting is just OK, not as atrocious as some on here are saying, I think the problem has more to do with the poor written dialog in the script. The casting is way off. AJ Bowen looks more like a refugee from a comic book convention than a rich man's son. The parents look way too young. Despite all this, the thing that totally ruined the movie for me was the camera work. The movie began by jumping between a steady image and some of the most shaky hand held photography since the Zapruder film. Either the DP or the film director must have had the misguided idea that shaking a camera creates tension. When the action starts at the dinner table with the family, they kick this shaking camera idea into full gear. When this happened, I simply could not look at the screen as the camera was going wild at this point. I actually thought it would be interesting to see the movie with some sort of stabilizing software applied. Ended up stopping the movie in order to avoid nausea.",You're Next

The girls seemed to be at the lowest level of stupid and way more people died than necessary but because they couldn't stop screaming at the top of their lungs and get down on the floor, one after one was killed or at least shot. I also don't think I ever heard someone in a movie scream ""we're all going to die"" as many times as the women in those 5 minutes did. The screaming continued for what felt like 30 minutes so I shut it off and took a break to calm down and then picked up where I left off and I'm still only about 35-40 minutes into it and as bad as this sounds, I am relieved as the dumb, screaming women are killed on pretty quickly because the minute that axe went into her head..her screaming finally stopped and now maybe I can watch this movie to the end. I love horror movies and can normally watch even the worse all the way through but when the characters are this stupid and doing the opposite of what would make sense, it has to go.

I hadn't heard of anyone in it before and a few of them were kinda weak but Erin really made up for it. I think she would be amazing in an action movie. I thought the beginning was poor because you have no time to know the character who dies first, in my opinion so I really didn't care he was dead. And also who would do what they did in a situation like that? There's this thing called crawling you know. I thought the film was similar to The Purge in a way.

There are a few good jumpy scenes here and there, but you will waste two hours of your life.The comedy element must be the horrendous acting, but the plot line is not clever like everyone is making it out to be.

It's simplistic in the sense that it could all realistically happen. No crazy special effects - just straight up suspense, horror & gore. The plot is intense & the ending is fantastic! The characters are realistic, as well. They're your typical All American, dysfunctional family. The siblings appear to be rivals & the parents are portrayed to be rather ""normal"" & very wealthy. I'm not one to scare easily, but this film had me about jumping out of my seat several times. I voted it a 9 due to the overall nature of it, & I titled it ""must see"" because it simply is that.

410,RileyRabbit,Not too bad,5,17 August 2014,"Neither awful nor fantastic. Quite good if you look at it as a sort of DIY movie made on the cheap. They had a few clever bits like the way it was rationalized why there was only one pop song playing over and over so they only had to license one pop song with the budget. The acting quality was variable but none of it was terrible. The action stays pretty steady throughout and the special effects were fairly well done. The plot, however, is very obvious once it gets going and the characters for the most part do the usual horror movie thing of never reacting to any situation in a way that a real person would. Afraid there is an intruder in the house? Split up and have mom stand out in the dark. Confirmed attack by violent killers coming from outside? Run out the front door. Full on attack? Have the most defenseless person lie down for a nap in an isolated room. And for a while in the middle we just have to undergo seeing most of the characters die in order of their boringness in order to get to the interesting part at the end. The ""surprise"" at the end is easy to guess from half-way through, but the last five minutes are still the best part.

So when the family killing spree the screen shakes way too much almost making me queasy. the killers bore me, the. fake blood looks too obviously fake. Also the twists are underwhelming due to poor acting. Then the young naive girlfriend all of a sudden becomes this expert killer yet I don't even feel interested as it's way too convenient that she was part of a survivalist group, this which is briefly mentioned yet there isn't any more substance too it.The final twist literally makes me sigh with boredom.Avoid at all cost..",You're Next

Unfortunately the movie is a little too quick, no real back story. This makes it really difficult to connect to any of the characters or have any real interest in what happens to them. Also it's not scary! I am still waiting on a horror film to legitimately scare me but they just always turn into a thriller more then anything else.

415,timmyodonovan1995,This Movie is So Bad That I'm Writing My First Review on How Terrible It Is,2,25 October 2017,"Okay so I've heard about this film for a few years now about how it's some underrated slasher flick that's just a fun time for viewers. I kept putting it off because I felt I had other movies to watch for awhile now. Recently, however, the director, Adam Wingard, released Death Note on Netflix which I watched and found a very niche sort of ironical charm to. So I decided to see another movie of his, You're Next, to see if he's just some sort of campy director. He isn't, he's just terrible. Spoilers ahead.The opening scene is honestly pretty good and sets the tone pretty well. After, however, it's all downhill. Firstly, all of the acting aside from maybe the father of the family is terrible. Everyone is either underacting or overacting to everything going on around them. The twist, or rather twists of the film are also dumb and obvious, frankly due to the terrible acting. It is so blindingly obvious as to why the ""baby"" of the family and his creepy girlfriend are in on the killings and it doesn't take long for the audience to piece together the motive. The second twist, however, is just plain stupid mainly because of how easily forgettable the Crispain character (sick name by the way, loser) is in terms of the story. I didn't care if he was in on it too by that point I just wanted the movie to end. Aside from the characters all being idiots, like not hiding certain bodies and literally walking to their deaths, I have a huge qualm with the lead Erin and how she ruins the ""final girl"" trope. The final girl is a trope that's old but welcome in my opinion and can be done very well like with Halloween, Alien, Scream and A Nightmare on Elms Street. Here, though, Erin is portrayed as this bad ass character who can perform Rambo moves on the killers with a stupid backstory (raised in a survival camp?) It takes the tension out knowing the final girl could easily kill the killers instead of the other way around. Huge mistakes all around with this film along with a few smaller mistakes sprinkled in for good measure. 3/10",You're Next

And this doesn't really have to be a ""thing"" with horror movies. More development done well equals a more fun/scary/heart-wrenching experience. But since that's not what we're talking about....The family in this film is upper-class suburban with a vacation home (mansion) where the family is all convening to celebrate their parents' anniversary. Then a lot of them start dying through non- natural causes. This movie is also described as a horror/comedy. I describe it as:A great, lost song (Soundtrack) + (Movie) No loyalty/love for the beige-paint equivalent of parents + a little bit (a lot) of entitlement + animal-masked killers + a fantastic, unexpected element +++++++++ killings = an interesting horror movie.Favorite/Most Hated Line: Felix: {talking to a family member} ""Will you just die already? This is hard enough for me!"" Terrible. There couldn't be a more first world problem. Yet....kinda funny in its self-awareness.But then I get sad when there are multiple close-ups on the ""assassins"" footwear and they are Army issue/military boots. There's also a line from one of the ""masks"" of ""He's dead and unlike you, I liked my brother.""I respect the assassins in the movie and see this plot point as a depressing reflection of societal norms. Give everything for this country but good luck when you return...enjoy your new jobs at Giant Conglomerate MegaMart for minimum wage. Or, you can ""subcontract"", survive and really hate yourself.
