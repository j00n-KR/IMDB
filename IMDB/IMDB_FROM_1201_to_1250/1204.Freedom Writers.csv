0,bkoganbing,The Wider World,9,10 January 2007,"Films about our educational system have been moneymakers from The Blackboard Jungle, to Up the Down Staircase, to Stand and Deliver and now Freedom Writers. This film and Hilary Swank's lead performance in it have an honored place among those previously mentioned.If you noticed the common thread running through all the films mentioned and this one is that it seems to take a neophyte teacher to shake up the system and try something new. And that's what Hilary Swank is in Long Beach High School a newly racially mixed school where all the kids seem to be balkanized. The real miracle that was wrought in Freedom Writers is that Swank gave these kids a vision of the wider world. And that vision showed that as young people they had far more in common than the race and ethnicity that divided them. The writing came when she had them keep diaries that could be read on a volunteer basis. I had a few good teachers like Hilary Swank in my youth. Some of them were just time servers and not terribly inspirational. Those are the folks the educational system ought to treasure.I'd expect nothing less than the best from a two time Oscar winner and Ms. Swank does deliver. She gets good support from Patrick Dempsey as the husband who becomes estranged from her with her single minded devotion to her kids and from Scott Glenn as her father.What was for me the best was having those kids read about the troubles of another young person who they could relate to. That would be Anne Frank and her diary. And the meeting of Swank's class with Holocaust survivors was tender and touching indeed.I wish she'd been my teacher and given me The Diary of Anne Frank to read. Better than reading Silas Marner.",Freedom Writers
1,SnoopyStyle,familiar formula,6,6 March 2016,It's 1994 L.A. Erin Gruwell (Hilary Swank) is a rookie wide-eyed idealistic English teacher in Woodrow Wilson high school. It's two years after the riots. The school was academically excellent until it voluntarily integrated. She is given the at-risk kids who segregate themselves into racial cliques. Her father Steve Gruwell (Scott Glenn) is disappointed in her wasting her effort. Her husband Scott Casey (Patrick Dempsey) slowly stops being supportive. Administrator Margaret Campbell (Imelda Staunton) refuses to give her proper books. Erin gives the kids diaries to write in. The movie also follows the narrator student Eva Benitez who witnesses her boyfriend's drive-by shooting of her classmate and must testify.It follows the very familiar formula of the white savior teacher and the rough students in need of her help. Hilary Swank is excellent and pulls off this standard melodrama. She really needs help from the students but the young actors don't stand out. They are fine for the purpose of this movie but not much more. Their stories are sincere. I can't oppose its sincerity but it does wear thin when it hits the nail over the head so directly and so often. The heart is in the right place but the formula is unchanged.,Freedom Writers
2,edwagreen,Freedom Writers- It's Just the Same Old Story ***,8,22 April 2007,"As far as movies go, this is still an excellent adaptation of what goes on in our urban schools. Hilary Swank gives a superb performance as an idealistic teacher who confronts a bunch of misfits and becomes a miracle worker. This is where the movie suffers as is the case with most of these school movies. By the middle and end of these films such as ""To Sir, With Love,"" and ""The Ron Carey Story,"" the worst pupils imaginable become outstanding. We never saw this in earlier school films such as ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips,"" or ""Good Morning, Miss Dove.""The film is realistic when it shows the uncaring school district and especially the English supervisor. The latter was memorable.It should be noted that the real character that Swank portrayed left teaching after several years. If she were so devoted to education and so very successful in the classroom, she should have remained. After all, this was supposedly her calling in life and this supposed calling led to the break-up of her marriage.Let's challenge our film directors to make realistic movies about the school systems in our country.",Freedom Writers
3,michaelRokeefe,Inspirational. A feel good movie. Swank is great.,7,25 April 2007,"Based on the diaries of real Long Beach, California students. Hilary Swank is flawless as the passionate and overly dedicated teacher Erin Gruwell. Wilson Classical High School in Long Beach in the mid 90's was comprised of street tough students...the majority Latino, Black and Asian. Some were pure street gangsters; some just abused and or forgotten. The sometimes 'goody-goody' Gruwell provided a cease-fire zone for her English class students that felt like castaways from their homes as well as certain school faculty. Gruwell sacrificed her own home life and husband(Patrick Dempsey)to save these young people. She helped them reclaim their lives by providing them with journals to write their innermost thoughts, life secrets and hopes and dreams. Erin Gruwell used the Holocaust as her tool to bring awareness to racism and respect for humanity. Based on the book ""The Freedom Writers Diary"" by Gruwell and her class, this movie is a must see. Any classroom would find something to learn from this film. Kudos to director and screen writer Richard LaGravenese. Also in the cast are: Scott Glenn, Imelda Staunton, Deance Wyatt, April Lee Hernandez and Kristin Herrera.",Freedom Writers
4,hitchcockthelegend,The Diary of Anne Frank and the class of room 203.,8,18 December 2011,"The Diary of Anne Frank and the class of room 203.Freedom Writers is written and directed by Richard LaGravenese, who adapts from the Freedom Writers Diary written by Erin Gruwell and her class of students at Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach California. It stars Hilary Swank, Patrick Dempsey, Scott Glenn, Imelda Staunton, Jason Finn and Kristin Herrera.Swank plays Erin Gruwell, an inspirational teacher type who after taking up the teaching position at Woodrow Wilson finds her classroom is a hotbed of ill education and racial disharmony. With little support coming from her superiors and within her own marriage, Gruwell took a novel approach to the task in hand to make a real life difference to her students.There's been plenty of similar films of this ilk over the years, from way back with The Blackboard Jungle, up to Coach Carter, and stopping briefly for tea, cake and violence with The Principal and Dangerous Minds. Each follows a well worn path of a teacher rising to the challenge of making their respective students better people, even when the odds are stacked against them achieving positive results. Freedom Writers has a real life story in its favour, while the blending of Oscar winner Swank with non professional actors playing the students, really works well and gives the picture an earthy and grounded texture. True, it's full of clichés (racial stereotypes, troubled family backgrounds, dragonian principal), and you sense that even with an extended running time of two hours that we aren't quite getting the full story. Rendering the big class turnaround as seeming contrived. But this is a true uplifting film that's packed with poignant moments such as the impact of the Holocaust teachings on the class, with these passages neatly flecked with sequences involving the violence and dangers that the students face in their everyday lives.If you can get past those formulaic clichés? Then it becomes a film that's desperately hard to dislike. Besides, committed teachers such as Erin Gruwell are to be treasured, their importance never to be understated. This, in spite of some rough edges, is a fitting tribute to one teacher and a class who managed to overcome major obstacles. 8/10",Freedom Writers
5,jotix100,"To ""lady"" with love",8,13 December 2008,"Films about teachers have been many. The best of the genre always involves a motivator that will see right through the children in their care and serve as the inspiration that will elevate their young minds into making something out of their minds. Such is the premise for this fine film, written, and directed, by a man that truly understands the medium well: Richard LeGravenese.The focus is on a young woman teacher, Erin Gruwell, that goes to teach at a Newport Beach high school. The education system asks a lot of their teachers, who for a low salary must do the almost impossible job of instructing the kids in their charge not only the subject they are required to learn, but at the same time act as surrogate parents, something that many, as in the case of Ms. Gruwell, is taken as a duty they must accomplish.Ms. Gruwell has to face the reality of the classroom. She is able to overcome her fears because she finds a captive audience that has not been given the importance they deserve. Her own marriage suffers as a result of her involvement, and sacrifice, for the students. However, she gets the admiration and love of the young people in her care, to the point that they all want to continue with her, even though, she doesn't teach the junior or senior classes. All that is changed because of her work.Mr. Legrevanasse's screenplay and direction are a joy to watch. He involves us in the story from the start. We know that, eventually, these underprivileged children will realize what Erin has sacrificed in her own personal life in order to do her job. The director is lucky in having the services of Hillary Swank in the title role. She delivers big time. Patrick Dempsey doesn't have much to do in the picture as Erin's husband. Imelda Staunton puts in an appearance as the teacher that will not go out of her way for the children, but who realizes what Erin has accomplished.An inspirational film highly recommended to please audiences.",Freedom Writers

No matter how many times I watch, Freedom Writers always makes me cry. The stories of these kids are so real and so compelling, and one woman standing in the thick of it all, trying to make sense and help. you can't help but feel compassionate.

7,gradyharp,An Important Film from a Committed Company,10,22 April 2007,"FREEDOM WRITERS produces more catches in the throat than many a film in years. This viewer avoided the film, thinking it was yet another in a long line of 'bad school kids with criminal instincts' brought around by a champion teacher (starting with 'Blackboard Jungle' the same story has been told almost yearly!): it is a distinct pleasure to share that this film is so very different on many levels that it makes all the other school problem/redemption movies pale in comparison.Based on a true story about a Long Beach California High School just after integration and busing altered the state's educational system, the book ""The Freedom Writers Diary: How a Teacher and 150 Teens Used Writing to Change Themselves and the World Around Them"" by Erin Gruwell is a compilation of the journals of the student of a newly mixed racial classroom (African American, Latino, Cambodian, Chinese, White) voicing their experiences about coming together as a family due to the influence of a novice, naive, but highly motivated and insightful teacher - Erin Gruwell. The book was adapted for the screen by director Richard LaGravenese and carefully cast with young actors who represented the very groups about whom the story is written.Erin Gruwell (Hilary Swank, in her very finest role to date!) is married to a frustrated architect student Scott (Patrick Dempsey) who has 'settled ' for a life as a computer programmer. Erin, the daughter of a Civil Rights activist (Scott Glenn), is idealistic and wants to teach in a place where she is challenged, a chance to make her life meaningful. She graciously and naively steps into a classroom of high school freshmen, all form different gangs and scarred by racial violence, frustrated to be trapped in a classroom with a white woman who seems clueless to their real life problems, wanting to teach them literature! The story unveils the technique Erin develops to erase border lines and bond the students by visits to the Holocaust Museum, taking them to nice restaurants in Newport Beach, treating them with respect and asking them to see the similarities in each other. The students respond, despite the harsh warnings of Erin's fellow teachers Margaret (Imelda Staunton, in another exceptional role) who insists everything is by the old rules, and Brian (John Benjamin Hickey) who has little use for the new system and group of students. As an example of how the students transform their characters is the funding of a visit to Long Beach by the woman who hid Anne Frank (the students have read her diary as a vulnerable Jewish child) and Pat Carroll plays that woman Miep Gies in yet another outstanding performance.Though the film is strong in every moment and every member of the cast (though the brilliance of Hilary Swank's portrayal is one of incredible realism and subtlety) and the various actors who comprise the Freedom Writers are superb: April Lee Hernandez, Mario, Jason Finn, Deance Wyatt, Kristin Herrera, Jacklyn Ngan, Sergio Montalvo, Vanetta Smith, Gabriel Chavarria, Hunter Parrish, Antonio García, Giovonnie Samuels, and Jacklyn Ngan and yes, they all deserve mentioning in a review. This is a full company effort and the result is a deeply moving film that celebrates the individual and the right to hope and to achieve. A Must See Experience. Grady Harp",Freedom Writers
8,Sylviastel,Try Being in her Shoes!,9,29 April 2007,"Believe me, I'm there working as a student teacher in one of America's toughest cities. Of course as the Ccaucasian teacher, I understand, sympathize, empathize, and totally understand Erin Gruwell's experience. It's tough to be an English teacher when your students have a million other things on their mind. Of course, I admire Erin's determination and was recommended this film. From what I saw, I think it was amazing that they got Imelda Staunton in this film. Patrick Dempsey in a supporting role as Erin's boyfriend. Hillary Swank makes me believe and understand her as Erin Gruwell, the teacher who won't give up with her students. The administration is equally discouraging as is the faculty. The post-Rodney King integration is not working at Long Beach High School. The races are just divided. In order to understand them, she reads their personal journals which shows the horrors of their young lives. She gives them Anne Frank's diary to read. While I haven't read their book, I'm sure they can identify with Anne's plight. The line in the classroom was a good way to get them to come forward about their personal lives, the tragedies, the shootings, the drugs, the domestic violence, etc. Life is not easy but for children of inner cities where their neighborhoods are more war torn in mentality. As an aspiring English teacher, I hope to make a difference and get students involved. For instance, I'm working in Newark and the Bard of Newark is Philip Roth. Of course, most people don't know Roth or his works or that he writes about them. I went out and got books for them to read and write about. I'll find out tomorrow about how effective it is.",Freedom Writers
9,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Freedom Writers,8,7 April 2007,"It's easy to dismiss at first glance that Freedom Writers as yet another run off the mill troubled teenage class with an inspirational teacher story where the latter whips the class into shape for graduation with some unorthodox teaching methods. In fact it is, except that it's based on accounts of real persons, and that it's full of heart.Hilary Swank plays the reel life Erin Gruwell, a newbie teacher who goes into class 203 totally wide eyed and full of zest, only to find that her students, the product of the education system's ""radical"" integration policy, are filled with street smart punks that the other veteran educators wouldn't give a damn about. With most of them involved in street gangs, drive by shootings, violence and such, she's determined to stay on and make a difference to their lives, and in essence, to give them an education.And it's not just education by going through the motions and mechanics of the curriculum, but real life skills and awareness in issues pertaining to their troubled lives - things like racial tolerance, harmony, and even lessons learnt from the largest gangster group in the history of mankind - the Nazis and the horrors of the Holocaust. In fact, it's the re-telling of these stories, featuring real survivors, and including the readings of select chapters in the Diary of Anne Frank, that distinguishes Freedom Writers from its genre peers, as we experience in tandem with the class, the take aways from the museum and field trips.In essence, not only are there struggles for respect within the class, there's also Erin's battle with the bureaucratic system, and the fight back against prejudice she faces from her envious, clearly more experienced, colleagues, who to them, teaching is just a job. I suppose after many years in the same role, people do get jaded once in a while. But to experience someone coming in to make real changes, and to do what is right rather than just to do a job, makes one sit up and evaluate one's own career.I thought Hilary Swank did a commendable job acting her role as the teacher who's willing to involve personal sacrifice to reach out and gain respect from her class, in order to fulfill her objective of getting their attention, and giving them a good education. And the real Erin Gruwell and her Freedom Writers, do deserve some respect in trying to change people's lives for the better.Freedom Writers clocks in just slightly over 2 hours, but it's a delight to sit through as we follow the class and teacher through 2 years of school. Its message is simple, that we often misunderstand people who are different, either through looks, skin colour, family name and background etc, and that often leads to conflicts of various sorts. The road to peace, is naturally to reach out with sincerity, and truly understand the other party. In order words, make love, not war. The pen here, is truly mightier than the sword.",Freedom Writers
10,Smells_Like_Cheese,A very good movie,7,18 January 2007,"I actually wasn't up to seeing Freedom Writers, it looked like a total rip off of Dangerous Minds, but after so many promising reviews, my friend and I checked it out tonite and I have to say while it is still in my opinion a copy off of Dangerous Minds, it's all good. It had a new little twist on it for a new generation who didn't have the opportunity to see Dangerous Minds. The stories were truly inspiring and very heart breaking at the same time. I never really thought how much of our history is still true to this day, you know? But it goes to show how history will always repeat itself despite how people will always claim that what is currently happening to them is a first time.Mrs. G is a new teacher to a reform school where she will teach freshman and sophomore English. She finds the task harder when she doesn't realize what she has truly gotten herself into with the gang violence and the drug wars constantly going on. The fear that the students have not knowing if they are really going to make it to the age of 18 and trying to have courage to survive each day. At first they give Mrs. G a hard time, that is until she finds a way through history like the holocaust, to show them that the struggles they face is always eternal. Asking them to write down their feelings, stories, and thoughts into a journal, they soon become the ""Freedom Writers"".Freedom Writers was a truly good movie that I was pleasantly surprised with, it had great acting and a very inspiring story. My favorite moment was when they had the woman who sheltered the Franks during the Holocaust come in and speak to the kids and told them how they could make a difference just by following their hearts and doing what they thought was right. I would recommend Freedom Writers, especially if you loved Dangerous Minds ;).7/10",Freedom Writers
11,blanbrn,Good but nothing special.,6,16 January 2007,"""Freedom Writers"" a film that sends a good message and gets to it's point of helping others is good, but it seems as if this good teacher theme is getting old in Hollywood. When I saw this it reminded me of 1995's ""Dangerous Minds"" you have the same plot a tough concerned teacher wanting to change the ways of young black students who grew up in slums. This film is based in mid 1990's L.A. just after the Rodney King riots when tensions were high. Hillary Swank is likable and good as always here as the young inspirational teacher Erin Gruwell who gains love and respect from students by getting them to keep journals daily. Overall this movie is touching and inspirational, but sometimes I think that Hollywood can go overkill with the good teacher turns bad student into a winner theme. This theme is mostly a dream as the school system needs changing, we can only dream for good teachers like Erin Gruwell.",Freedom Writers
12,sddavis63,A Powerful Movie With Truly Interesting Content,9,22 October 2009,"I've been a bit of the opinion lately that this whole concept (underdog overcomes, and the focus on the person who helps them overcome) is getting a bit stale and tired, because it's been overdone. I have to concede that this movie is a powerful demonstration that if it's well done, this type of movie can still be very effective. No, it isn't particularly original. The idealistic young teacher goes into a class of troubled students and makes a difference! Yeah, it's a true story but we have seen it before. And yet, it works - and it works very well. It works so well partly because of Hilary Swank. I had my doubts. Her work has generally not overwhelmed me, but she did a good job with this part. I thought she captured the essence of teacher Erin Gruwell well - idealistic at first, frustrated and confused when she finds out how difficult this class is going to be, and then fiercely determined as she makes a plan to help the class out and refusing to back down under pressure. I liked the plan. That was probably what gave this movie the edge it would have lacked if it had just been a copy of all the others like it. Her decision to challenge the gang mindset of the class by comparing it to Nazism, and eventually using the Diary of Ann Frank as a teaching tool that got into the kids heads was fascinating. The use of real Holocaust survivors was moving, and, while she was played by Pat Carroll, the story of Miep Gies, who hid Ann Frank, was well used.It was also effective to see the classroom as a microcosm of the larger problem - as the city was divided into racial groups who both loathed and feared each other, so was the classroom. The lone white student who had no friends or allies because he was alone and therefore had to fear everyone was especially haunting. The growing bond between the students and the breaking down of the barriers was perhaps portrayed a bit too quickly and easily, but still made the point that barriers can be broken down bit by bit. As with many of the movies of this type, there was also an effective critique of an education system that really prefers to give up on its troubled kids rather than help them rise above their troubles.It's a pretty powerful movie. 9/10",Freedom Writers
13,Buddy-51,succeeds despite the clichés,7,12 January 2007,"""Freedom Writers"" is a film that really shouldn't work but somehow does. After all, it's been over fifty years since ""The Blackboard Jungle"" drew up the blueprint that all future ""super teacher"" dramas would feel called upon to follow. The formula goes something like this: a young, hopelessly naive idealist from a privileged background, filled with romantic notions about molding young minds and saving the world, is rudely thrust into an inner city classroom overflowing with recalcitrant troublemakers and streetwise thugs whom all the other faculty members and school board big wigs have written off as incapable of learning. After a few sessions in which the students run roughshod over the touchy-feely, ill-prepared newcomer, the teacher inevitably achieves a breakthrough by reaching the kids ""where they're at,"" eventually turning them all into model citizens no longer cognizant of socioeconomic or racial barriers and all ready to move ahead and make something of their lives. Inevitably, the teacher becomes a role model for the youngsters, one who has to fight a constant, solitary battle against the other burnt-out faculty members, administrators and school district bureaucrats who have long ago given up expecting the kids to learn and feel that if they are simply able to ""warehouse"" them and keep them from killing one another in the hallways, they are fulfilling their responsibilities as faithful stewards of the taxpayers' money.Given its slavish adherence to the formula, it's hard not to be cynical about a movie like ""Freedom Writers,"" but damned if the whole thing doesn't worm its way into our affections despite all our best efforts to resist it (maybe some formulas ARE formulas for the simple reason that they actually work). The movie is based on an actual English teacher named Erin Gruwell, who arrived at Wilson Classical High School in Long Beach, Ca., in the fall of 1993. Faced with a class full of hostile African-American, Asian and Hispanic gang members, Gruwell eventually broke down their resistance and got them interested in learning by having them write personal journals in which they poured out their innermost thoughts, concerns and feelings about their lives and the world in which they lived. This led to a publication of the students' writing and the setting up of a foundation dedicated to helping inspire other inner city kids to stay in school and reach for the stars.It is the initial journal entries that serve as the source for much of the screenplay, and writer/director Richard LaGravenese has wisely chosen to showcase their entries in the form of voice-over narration. More than anything else, it is this device that lends the film the depth it might otherwise lack and that lifts it above the clichés of the genre. The other key element in the film's success is the uniformly excellent work turned in by the actors and actresses playing the youngsters. Each and every one of them has a natural and believable way about them that draws us into the lives of the characters they are portraying. Particular notice should be paid to April L. Hernandez and Deance Wyatt who are genuine standouts in a truly impressive ensemble cast. Hillary Swank does well in the role of Gruwell, but it is a measure of the casts' talent here that she is often upstaged by the youngsters. I can imagine this film serving as the launching pad for quite a few impressive careers in the future.The movie acknowledges the downside of Gruwell's nobility and dedication by chronicling the negative effect the job has on her marriage and home life, but these scenes aren't dramatized in a particularly convincing way, so all they really succeed in doing is slowing down the action and diluting the impact of the teacher/student relationships (Patrick Demsey and Scott Glenn are also largely wasted in the roles of Gruwell's less-than-supportive husband and father respectively). Moreover, the other faculty members are little more than straw man caricatures whose sole purpose is to serve as foils against which Gruwell's nobility can stand out all the more impressively. (The wonderful Imelda Staunton does, however, manage to imbue her stereotype of the bitter, nay-saying educator with a surprising amount of depth and humanity). Gruwell's experience with these youngsters is compelling enough in its own right without having to stack the deck against her unnecessarily and reducing everyone else to the level of callous villain just to make the point.It's true that anyone who has seen ""To Sir With Love,"" ""Up the Down Staircase,"" ""Stand and Deliver,"" ""Dangerous Minds"" - or any of the countless other ""Blackboard Jungle"" knockoffs that have come our way over the years - will not be surprised by much that happens in ""Freedom Writers,"" but there are many genuinely touching moments in the movie, especially those involving a field trip the kids take to the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles, their reading of ""The Diary of Anne Frank,"" and their meeting with the actual woman (here played by movie veteran Pat Carroll) who helped to hide the Franks and others from the Nazis.The movie does hint at one further potential dark side to the ""super teacher"" phenomenon. At the end of the movie, we are informed that Gruwell followed her students throughout their four years of high school, then took a job as a teacher at a local college. One wonders why, if this was such a ""calling"" for Gruwell, she didn't ultimately stick with the profession beyond the initial four years. Could it be that such teachers are like dazzling supernovas that blaze brightly for a season then burn themselves out, leaving the duller but steadier stars to light the way for future students? Sad to say, that may just be the one unintended message audiences will take away from the movie.",Freedom Writers
14,g-bodyl,This Defines the Inner City Struggle of Education!,9,24 October 2014,"Freedom Writers is a great inside look at the struggle kids had to face in the aftermath of Rodney King and the race riots. In the early 90's, these kids grew up on gang violence and racism and everyone had their own group such as blacks, whites, Cambodians, Mexicans, and so on. This film is an emotional take on the tale of reform against the odds. By the end of the film, no matter your masculinity, you won't have a dry eye. Whilst the outcome may or may not be predictable, it's the way the battle is fought that truly defines this underrated drama.Richard LaGravanese's film is about a first-year white teacher named Erin Gruwell who is appalled at the lack of education her students receive. Despite receiving backlash from everyone in her life such as her father, her husband, and her boss, Gruwell decides to make an education a priority for her students. While not well-received at first, noticeable changes are soon to come.Hilary Swank comes really close to beating her best performance to date which is her role in 2004's Million Dollar Baby. Swank possesses the determination to make her role work and through her character, we can see the importance of equal education to everyone. I liked April Lee Hernandez as Eva, one of Erin's students. She is so determined to hold her ground and survive. Imelda Staunton is good at playing the bad guy, though we can sort of sympathize with her character's plight.Overall, Freedom Writers is a great movie that has a main theme in that everyone deserves an equal education. It's formulaic in parts, but nothing a strong, well-written script cannot fix. I like how they incorporate the themes of the Holocaust in the film because it's similar to what these teens face. The Diary of Anne Frank is an excellent memoir and it is the perfect book for the film to use. This movie defines survival and how these teens fight their own wars in the streets. But the simple message is: education is survival. I rate this film 9/10.",Freedom Writers
15,inkblot11,"High on the list of films dealing with high schoolers, that's where this film should be!",8,3 March 2007,"Erin (Hilary Swank) is a young teacher, fresh out of college. Her parents raised Erin to have a zeal for helping foster peace and social harmony. Therefore, she chooses to start her career in Long Beach, California, a troubled suburb of Los Angeles. The community is just getting on its feet after the Rodney King-inspired riots and the school is riddled with distinct ethnic groups and gangs. There is a black group, an Hispanic group, a Cambodian group and a white group, and all of them seem to hate and mistrust the others. Enter Erin. An idealist, she first experiences great difficulty in getting her students attention. Nevertheless, she commits herself to finding a way to inspire her students. She takes on extra jobs to help pay for books and field trips, much to the chagrin of her husband (Patrick Dempsey). One of the trips is to a Holocaust museum. There, her students finally come to develop an interest in learning. Will it last? This is a very fine film, based on real events, and greatly moving. Swank is quite good as the inspiring teacher. Even more impressive are the student actors and the roles they are playing. The real life students had guns, gangs, broken homes, and even more to contend with every day. That they cared at all about what a teacher had to tell them is amazing. The young folks taking on these roles, for the film, are extremely authentic and genuine in their portrayals, especially the young actress playing Eva. Dempsey has a most unflattering role as the so-called put-upon husband but he looks good, ladies. The costumes and sets are very nicely chosen, too. If you have seen Dangerous Minds or Take the Lead, you will like this film very much. But, even if you think a movie about teenagers is something you'd rather skip, don't! This film is an inspiration for everyone and a calling for individuals everywhere to be part of life's solutions and not part of the problems.",Freedom Writers

Is that offensive?)Freedom Writers is your typical, bad black school. White person tries to save the black children who come from broken homes. (oh Look there is one white kid in the back). White savior saves the main cast of African Americans (oh and the white kid who is in the back) by giving them pen and paper.I watched this as a snot-nosed punk kid. At the time racism, race bait movies I was oblivious to. I enjoyed the movie. I didn't really see colour at the time. I saw someone trying to help people.
As I got older social issues became more noticeable. These race bait movies become redundant with the same narrative.Broken group of black people can't help themselves until 90% of the time a white savior helps them. Someone dies. They are defiant at first. Then they love the white savior.The acting from I remember were done by new young actors so it wasn't anything that was A++++++++. The acting was good though. I remember the color of the film being very grayish especially when they were in the classroom.Overall at the time it was a great movie. Very warm.

17,Dr_Coulardeau,Yest teachers can change,10,23 April 2009,"The central subject of any pedagogical project, and not a project like the dilapidated new housing projects for ghetto people who are not kept in a ghetto any more but in a separate urban area where they are supposed to only hurt themselves or one another, is teaching. Teaching as a project, but what is that? It is to flush down the toilet the syllabus, the pre-digested and pre-fabricated classes and courses, you know that course that is produced once and for all till the teacher retires. Comfortable for do-little personnel. But totally deadly and morbid for the kids, but who cares about the kids who are flunkies and unable to be anything else. A project it is to let the students dictate the class, the syllabus, the method, the themes and the objectives, though the objectives are also slightly determined by the teachers from time to time, at least by making the students discuss them and agree on them. That's not very difficult actually, because they want to know how to read, write, speak English and even calculate, compute, multiply and divide at ease. But that is only the easy part of the project because it is the jam that is going to bring the sweet teeth and sweet tongues of the students together. The most difficult part is to love the students. In the film the English teacher says ""like"" not to antagonize the colleagues, not to give them an easy argument to speak of perversion. But it is ""love"" that is needed her. You have to love them and make them feel happy and glad to be loved and free to love back, and that love is called respect. They may one day have a sharp word with the teacher and some angry remarks about the class or the school. But love is the real wrapping of this little pebble, the wrapping that provides everyone with the warmth that may take you across the winter, the spring flood of the local river or a divorce. The worst things the do-nothing-change-nothing self-satisfied senior teachers may say will come then when they realize the relation has become personal between the teacher and the students. They will insinuate that it is far beyond that personal and has reached the intimate level. And there some may even get scared, or frightening to others, parents particularly, with innuendo and slandering. The film is discreet about this last part of the opposition to that new method of dealing with ""flunkies"", but it is constantly present in the back of their eyes (the dirty voyeurs they are) and of their minds (if they have a mind of their own). A very delicate and tender film about the least tender people in the world, the kids from the projects that have replaced the ghettos after the last riots in Los Angeles. It gives you a taste of change so you can toast change on a pit and enjoy the sweet marshmallow that stuffs that change to the very brim.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID",Freedom Writers
18,johnnyboyz,Detention for all involved; as an uninteresting story of kids coming around to their senses by way of a woman's teaching abilities is given a soppy and uninvolved exploration.,4,15 April 2010,"Freedom Writers did not strike me as the humbling, harrowing, emotionally charged piece that it seems to have done so many others. It struck me as an odd reworking of 1990's Kindergarten Cop played more for grimaces than laughs this time round, rather distastefully using The Holocaust as an overlying umbrella under which to fabricate feeling; soul and heart. The film is supposedly based on a true story, but for a film to have been done so, Freedom Writers certainly feels false; hockey and generic at every which way. The film flicks between narration from the school kids within the text to the teacher teaching them; it covers the life of the kids living how they live to the marital problems that come about from dedication to the class and it does all this whilst using Anne Frank's diary as an item to fast-track an aura of heart in order to force us to feel for all these people. We ought not be fooled. The true story of a group of mismatched kids coming to terms with life; education and equality is quite humbling, but not when it's squeezed out through the syrupy filter of the TV movie of the week aesthetic; The Holocaust is obviously one of the darkest hours in mankind's history, but don't use it in a text that's about anything but said event. All of it culminates in a meek, disturbingly uninvolved drama.The lead of the film is a certain Erin Gruwell (Swank), a toothy; perky; smiley lead whose beaming face and broad smile instills a stark sense of kindness and likability into the audience, this after a brief opening from the perspective of young Hispanic-American girl Eva (Hernández) whose past-tragedy, she informs us, is an awareness of racism in her father being arrested for what she describes as a 'rasict arrest' and a hatred of the rest of a world in general as a result of this. What follows is a degree of pleasure derived from an initiation into gang life and the consequent living of that life. She's in the class, along with other hoodlums; misfits and petty criminals of Hispanic; African-American and Hmong descent, that Erin's about to take over. Being a 1st time teacher and jumping head first into the deep end, other teachers have their doubts; one student gives her a week before she cracks. Roll up your sleeves, because the job is on.I preferred the formula when it was applied to 2005 French film The Chorus; a film set in post-Second World War France at a boarding house for boys. The lead in that case was a kind elderly gentleman, whom was far less annoying than Swank's Erin Gruwell, and used classical music plus the formation of a choir as a means of controlling them more-so persistent hark backs to the Death Camps of central Europe of around the 1930s and 40s. The Chorus was damp, bleak and dishevelled in its cinematography; the class subjects younger and therefore more prone to dafter and more dangerous things in a more off the cuff manner. The film was more interested in how the lead's teaching had an effect on the pupils' later lives, and the soundtrack consisted of quaint, calming music that were representable of the teacher's methods in bringing around the boys. This was music they did not know existed, and their respective arcs which spanned their entire lives, would eventually bring them around to feel emotions they were yet to realise existed. Freedom Writers thinks it's effective to have the latest and lamest in Hip-Hop from groups that name themselves things like: ""will.i.am"" and ""RZA"" acting as the soundtrack to the transformation; the camera gently tracking in one on occasion to a beaming Swank whilst the name 'Anne Frank' lingers oddly in the background on a chalkboard in what is an absurd moment among many.The class room sequences are punctuated by a series of meetings Erin has with her father Steve (Glenn); their interactions shot mostly in profile as they sit at tables to accentuate conflicting ideas: ""You're teaching people who don't give a damn about education"" so he says. The majority of the teachers at the school are white, or of Caucasian descent so there is that sense of 'senseible' whites teaching a bunch of multi-cultured delinquents, but there you go. Director/co-writer Richard LaGravenese does his best to try and inject some sort of level of study into proceedings; sequences such as the scenes shot in duality as two girls of similar ages, but of different ethnicities, dress up for a night out in the exact same fashion suggesting there is a link between the two. On another occasion, Erin separates the class by way of a physical shifting of people beyond a line drawn in the middle of the room so that everyone is eventually made to believe they have so much more in common with each other than first presumed. Due to the low intelligence of the class, the film has Erin consistently spelling-out-everything-that-she-means-in-her-speech so as they understand, enabling the film to keep it nice and simple for the watching audience so as they may come to observe the simplistic sensitivity the makers think they've got going on here – it's ultimately pitifully undramatic. Freedom Writers is paced ploddingly at the best of times and is by the numbers throughout; crass in its assumption we would find any of the content involving and daft in its use of the Holocaust and Anne Frank's diary to try and further the emotional depth that it thinks it has. Tacky, underwhelming and nowhere near as complicated as it thinks it is; Freedom Writers is a mess.",Freedom Writers
19,leplatypus,American History XI (dvd),10,9 July 2011,"First of all, this movie shows an alternative to massive sequels: find a tragic and moving story of individuals (not a biopic from a celebrity please) to tell the world about it and thus make us find inspiration and meditation.I must admit that i was dubious at first about the actual fate of those students: America isn't at war and it's not the third world: thus, if students behave poorly at schools, it's only laziness.But, two facts of the movie change my views: first, one young black actor, Armand Jones, have indeed been killed by a gang. Then, nearly all those students have been shot at while i never even heard a gun blast in all my life in France and Europa! Thus this movie unveils a sad and dark side of America that is never really tackled by Hollywood: racial urban violence! As the other movie that slapped my face like this, ""American history X"" (thus my title for this review), youths are divided between blacks, Latinos, Asians and white. No relationships between them except for violence. i witness the same thing in France: Everyday at lunch, in subway, communities stay inside their members. I never understood those groups and feel rather belonging to the one humankind: as a trainee in European parliament, i have no french friends but Greek, Spanish, Swedish or Italian. Later, a close friend has been Moroccan! This movie is thus a good step to the right direction: I really appreciate that their connection happens with Holocauste and Anne Franck: it's a great hope that those freedom writers can find inspiration into that heavy past to change their life, because the pledge of ""it's a lesson and it will not repeat again"" hasn't really been implemented.In conclusion, this is a moving testimony of the best of us, embodied by a terrific cast!",Freedom Writers
20,Ed-Shullivan,Freedom Writers .a great novel evolves into an inspiring feature film,10,14 December 2014,"Freedom Writers is a loosely based story about a young school teacher named Erin Gruwell (played by Hilary Swank) who chose to start her teaching career at a high school that had two years earlier integrated low income students from other districts. This is a story that is filled with a class room of young student's whose tragic lives don't seem to have any hope for a future except to survive amongst their own culture(s) for protection in fear of being harmed otherwise.The film is somewhat violent and has a negative downtrodden tone for the first 40 minutes but if you persevere, I promise there is a turning point in the film that will tug at your heart, instill pride in these students and a belief that with just one great teacher, one mentor who believes in you, YOU can accomplish whatever you put your mind to.It is a story about understanding one another's struggles and sometimes we begin to realize that our own struggles pale in comparison to others, if we are willing to understand the people around us, and the challenges some of them have overcome.I see some parallels between Freedom Writers and the journey many individuals encounter when developing and delivering any training in almost any field one can imagine. Although not as dramatic, I believe from time to time your students may feel that the task is too big, and the training is too complex, and so what is the point? Well I trust this film will inspire you individuals who are Trainers to mentor your class of students to persevere and to encourage them to hang in there as they will see that if you work together and support one another that work and life is so much more fulfilling.I forewarned you that the first 40 minutes are a bit violent and edgy, but the remainder of the film is nothing but an inspirational film based on tolerance, caring, and perseverance, with an emphasis that we are all just people trying to get along. There are some scenes that may bring you to tears with the love that Mrs. Gruwell embraces her multi-cultural class with, but that is not the parallel I see. I see a long journey ahead with good days and some bad days but if we hang in there together your journey and your students' journey will be rewarding.My favorite scene in Freedom Writers occurs at the 1 hour, 27 minute, 35 second interval. I hope you enjoy Freedom Writers and feel inspired! Good luck on your own journeys.A perfect 10/10",Freedom Writers
21,lisafordeay,Very underrated film starring Hilary Swank,7,6 October 2021,"Freedom Writers is a 2007 biopic starring Hilary Swank, Imelda Staunton,Mario and Patrick Dempsey. The film is about a young woman named Erin Gurrell(Swank) who starts a job as a teacher in a rough Hugh school where the majority of them are from gang crimes and are African American.Will Erin put command on her new students?Overall I thought it was a good film. Hilary Swank was very good in this film as her character went through everything for her students and she didn't care what the rest of the teachers thought. Danny De Vito serves as an executive producer from his company Jersey Films. Speaking of Patrick Dempsey he was grand in this as Hilary Swank's grounded husband Scott. This also happens to be his first film of 2007 as he would later star in Enchanted opposite Amy Adams.",Freedom Writers
22,robert-temple-1,"Film Making at the Highest Possible Level, Fifty Stars",10,31 December 2007,"This is not just a film, it is reality distilled as an essence. I don't think one should hesitate to describe it as one of the most important films ever made. If cinema is to mean anything, it must touch us at the heart and change us forever, just as the true events portrayed in this film changed all who were involved so that they would never be the same. This film ought to be shown to every teenaged student in the world, and to every teacher. Maybe then we might get somewhere as a species. I have never seen such a searing and poignant lesson in human tolerance as is shown here. The film owes so much to Hilary Swank, who although she did not originate it, effectively gave it its soul. One had suspected from her previous work that she must be an extraordinary person, in a category of her own, and after seeing this, one felt sure of it, but it was proved absolutely by the documentary special features on the DVD. She is a strange looking girl, and it seems that her unique face owes a great deal to her descent from American Indians, with their noble look that they so often have. However, the personality that shines from this actress is nothing to do with acting (which merely enables her to project it), it is her essence as a person which makes this film. She is the perfect choice to portray the remarkable heroine Erin Gruwell, whose true story this is. The director Richard LaGravenese, whose amazing earlier screenplays thrilled millions ('The Bridges of Madison County', 'The Horse Whisperer'), was the perfect choice for director of this film, and he delivers the ultimate result, which is sheer perfection. Spectacular performances are delivered by the young actors April Hernandez, Jason Finn, Deance Wyatt, Mario, and the others. Imelda Staunton is brilliant at playing a loathsome woman whom we all want to strangle. The Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles also should be credited, as it is so crucial to the film. If the lesson of this film could be learned and absorbed, we might be able to save our planet and save ourselves. This film shows how young people who are engaged in brutal gang warfare, where they are literally shooting each other in the streets every day (Long Beach, California, really is like this, apparently), and who live only to hate and to kill can be turned around and learn to experience tolerance and even to become friends. This might sound like a liberal fantasy or pipe dream, but this film is as far from being one of those hypocritical, patronizing dramas about the pacification of unruly kids by a loving teacher as it is possible to get. There is not one millisecond of false sentimentality in this film. This film shows life at the sharpest edge there is, and how the most extreme human situations imaginable can be saved, not by false liberalism, but by straight, bold, and courageous honesty. Everyone involved in this magnificent achievement deserves every international award there is. This goes way beyond the Oscars. This qualifies for the Nobel Peace Prize. And frankly, that is what Erin Gruwell should be awarded if there is any justice in the world. Everyone should see this. If you haven't seen it, you have missed perhaps the deepest cinematic experience you could ever hope for. Let us hope that everyone carries the message beyond the screen, and that money pours into the Freedom Writers Foundation, and that there are many Erin Gruwells who begin to appear all over the earth.",Freedom Writers
23,yusufpiskin,your faces are forever engraved in my heart,8,12 August 2020,"I really don't understand the mostly-average reviews this film has on this site -- this film was amazing. Almost everything about it was amazing. Hilary Swank was fantastic, which means a lot because normally I don't enjoy her films. All the children in the classroom were very captivating; I grew emotionally attached to each one of them. The purpose and subject matter of this film was very engrossing to me -- racial injustice, especially when it comes to youth that don't get fair opportunities, is an issue I care about immensely. The story line quickly drew me in, as it was very emotionally gripping -- so much so that I teared up a bit on more than one occasion. And I was so completely involved that as I felt the end of the film approaching, I began to feel a sense of dread; I didn't want it to end, I wanted to keep on watching and keep on watching for at least a couple more hours. Which, in my book, is the marking of a truly great film. Honestly, this is one of my favorite films of all time -- very highly recommended.",Freedom Writers

But these pseudo reality flicks provide something else, a clear message: put in a year or two teaching, write a book, hope for a screenplay and enjoy retirement at 30. After Million Dollar Baby, Swank is looking for another star vehicle. This isn't it unless you really enjoy the formula treatment of education. So if repetition is your thing then this is your movie.

It's an important issue because education should never be limited by anything, even by the targets saying that they don't want to receive them. I really like significant references to other strong true stories especially about the holocaust. The montage used in this movie is a bit too much for me. It should've used more duration instead and build more on the detailed stories of more individuals of the class.

However the script is quite poor and it shows. It's in the line of Crash but not quite as bad where racial cliques or minorities are divided out and roles are subdivided neatly and stereotyped in an ends justifies the means fallacy of argument. The individual is no longer emphasized, rather racial groups are emphasized hypocritically - a lot of victimizing and stereotyping within the movie's depictions contribute to the very thing the movie is preaching against. Also preposterous are supposed totally unprofessional behavior from other English teacher and principal bent into saying or acting out more than a few absurd reactions/thoughts in school in an effort to be antagonizing - transparently awful and over-dramatized. The movie is all over the place. Side stories like her marriage are neglected or shouldn't be added. It's a mess and the writing has failed here.

28,MartianOctocretr5,Better then expected,7,5 May 2007,"When this movie opens with references to the L.A. riots of 1992, you wonder where they intend to go with it. A young idealistic teacher arrives for work on the first day of a new school year at a tough inner city school, immediately evoking memories of ""To Sir, with Love."" The film could have been a contrived, schmaltzy imitation of that great classic, but it soon proves itself, and stands on its own. Hillary Swank (as the teacher) demonstrates great sincerity in this role; the fear mixed with her idealistic enthusiasm as she faces a classroom full of scary looking teens of mixed races shows on her face in every shot. Her character's sensitivity and guts in following her convictions on how to reach out to these kids is mastered well.The film surprises you. Some of the tough personalities obviously headed for trouble could have been shown as stereotypical clichés, but the movie avoids this irritating and exploitive plot device. The characters are presented in a brutally honest way: yes, they're abrasive, angry, and jaded, but we learn they have reason to be. Apparently, this was based on a true story, but the back stories of some of these kids seem to be composites of different individuals. It's hard to believe anyone of them could have endured some of these appalling events. One thing's for sure from their writings: inner city life is as intimidating and difficult as you would expect, and then some. Predictably, there's ignorant and arrogant suits and others deliberately and interfering with the progress the teacher and the kids make. Some of this is necessary for dramatic conflict of course, but it's overstated, one of the film's few minor problems.A positive outlook allows this story to present a thoughtful and insightful message. Swank is to be commended for her work on this movie. It's worth your while to see it.",Freedom Writers
29,wisewebwoman,Surprisingly good for its genre,8,30 April 2007,"We might not remember the lessons or the classrooms or even the school but a good teacher is remembered for ever.I thought this might be another cliché, never quite measuring up to ""To Sir with Love"", ""The Blackboard Jungle"". ""Stand and Deliver"", ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" and others of that excellence but I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was and how thoroughly I was emotionally invested in it at the end.It is based on a true story of absolutely hopeless marginal students attending Woodrow Wilson High in Long Beach, an unhappily integrated school, and how this one teacher, the naive and newbie Erin Gruwell played marvelously by Hilary Swank, manages to tap into their psyches, get down to their level and understand the incredible challenges of their day to day lives. Lives fraught with guns, drugs, death and disinterested parents or none at all.She reaches them through ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" and by her own self sacrifice (at one time she works three jobs to get some money together for some day trips) thus igniting the first flame of passionate learning and understanding.Her marriage (a pretty Patrick Dempsey plays her whiney, needy husband) does not survive her extraordinary efforts and her cliché ridden dad (played by an absolutely ancient Scott Glenn, what happened to him?)is at odds with what his background supposedly was (a civil rights activist). The school kids, in the manner of Hollywood casting, are unsettlingly old, one in particular -Alejandro- looked as if he was pushing 30 from the wrong side. But on the whole the script moves it along beautifully and there are some memorable scenes of the kids at a holocaust museum and survivors of the holocaust having dinner with them.So yes, I would say this joins the ranks of the excellent school/inspiring teacher/turnaround students club.8 out of 10",Freedom Writers
30,Philby-3,"Erin beats the system, but no damages this time",9,24 March 2007,"This is the latest in a long line of ""teacher features""  ""Good-bye Mr Chips"", ""To Sir With Love"", ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"", ""Dead Poets' Society"" etc. In these films the teacher is the hero or heroine, often coming to some disadvantaged school and taking over a class dismissed by the timeservers as hopeless, and producing sparkling results. The strength of this movie, which is based on fact, is not so much in the performance of the ""heroine"" teacher (which is all one could ask for) but in the focus on the pupils themselves. They come from such disturbed backgrounds from the Long Beach, California, of the early 90s it is a wonder some of them are still alive, let alone at school. Many have lost brothers and sisters in gang warfare, been abused by police, mistreated by their parents and generally neglected. But when Erin Gruwell (Hilary Swank), provoked by the manifest racism in the class, gets them to write about themselves, their attitude changes from surly distain to an eagerness to learn.Naturally Ms Gruwell strikes the usual obstacles  threatened other teachers, lack of money (she takes on extra jobs to pay for school materials), skeptical management, though not much parental opposition as many are dead, or in jail. Her own family is not supportive  in fact her ""neglected"" husband eventually leaves her  though her father at least has the decency to congratulate her when she succeeds. But she and the kids triumph over all of that and the kid's writing is eventually published (not to mention the feature film).Once you do see what the kids are up against it is impossible not to feel the profoundest sympathy for them. Ms Gruwell's greatest achievement is to bring them to the realization that they are all  black, latino, Asian - brothers and sisters beneath the skin. At the end it is difficult for them to let go, but they are emotionally in immeasurably better shape than on the day she walked in to the class two years earlier.Of course Ms Gruwell is not without her critics, particularly Margaret (Imelda Staunton) her head of department and Brian (John Hickey), another English teacher (the latter a true prick, in my opinion  though both look like composite characters). They do have a point; in a large public education system the goal has to be the greatest good for the greatest number, and some are going to be left behind because their needs are too great. But Ms Gruwell does show that even meager resources can make a difference, if intelligently deployed, and the higher management has the sense not to intervene. Maybe she is going to wind up with her graduates the best writers in jail, but even that's an achievement, considering their background. The photo at the end of the picture suggests a great number of them survived and even thrived.Hilary Swank, who has the best eager beaver manner in the business, is pretty well definitive as Erin, but some of the kids are stunning as well, particularly April Hernandez as Eva, the hardest nut to crack, Jason Finn as Marcus and Deance Wyatt as Jamal. They are a bit old for their parts (the kids were meant to be about 16) but their conviction carries them through. Some of them are non-professionals but as a group they are terrific.This will not doubt not be the last teacher feature to be made but it will go down as one of the better ones. The real hero here is education, or enlightenment, a hero whose praises we cannot sing enough.",Freedom Writers

DANGEROUS MINDS, THE PRINCIPAL, etc., are examples of this well-trodden genre. I can hear my detractors now (""But this is a true story!"" and ""It's heartwarming!""). My dog ran away once and I thought we'd lost him forever. But he came back. It's a true story. And I consider my dog pretty heartwarming. But I'd NEVER consider putting it on film, as it too has been done to death (see HOMEWARD BOUND). I'm not comparing animal stories to human interest ones, but the emotional wallop they used to have has seriously waned.So let's get into the meat-and-potatoes of this sucker. To be completely honest, it's not all that bad. Hilary Swank pulls in a high-level performance as Erin Gruwell, a new teacher at a Long Beach, California school where racial integration has triggered turf wars. Blacks, Whites, Asians, and Latinos are all at each others' throats. Until (queue heroic music) Mrs. Gruwell arrives to save them from their hateful and murderous ways. At first she's at a loss of how to reach her new students. But she finally starts understanding how their lives outside the classroom directly affects what happens inside. She finally helps them grasp their prejudices by reading The Diary of Anne Frank. Learning about the Holocaust and the extreme persecution of the Jews, the classmates come together and learn to ignore skin color and focus on what's on the inside. Gruwell also aids them in writing journal entries which eventually were bound together into a book called (ta-da) ""The Freedom Writers Diary.""While her students battle their internal demons via close quarters in class and their journal entries, Gruwell has to battle the prejudices of the school faculty and the break-up of her marriage (because she spends so much time with her class versus at home with her husband).The big letdown is that there's nothing new here. Yes, again, the story is true. Yes, it's interesting. Yes, it's heartwarming. Yes, we've seen it time after time after time after time. The other problem I encountered was that these kids were supposed to be high school freshman (14 years old). But several of the boys were approaching or over six feet tall, and had mustaches along with five o'clock shadows. Kind of makes it difficult to suspend belief when seeing that.Still, there's a good story at its core.

32,jon.h.ochiai,Life is Context,10,13 January 2007,"Life is context. Hilary Swank's Erin Gruwell tells young gangster Marcus (Jason Fin), "" You know what happens when you're dead? People are going to go on living and forget all about you!"" 15 year-old Marcus wishes to ""die a warrior"" protecting his own. No, as Swank's Gruwell pleads his young death would accomplish nothing. For students in this Long Beach high school this is the gang and race war, where everyone loses, void of possibility, all about survival. For many, surviving to their 18th birthday is a milestone. In Director and Writer Richard LaGravenese's ""Freedom Writers"" based on the ""The Freedom Writers Diary"" by real-life teacher Erin Gruwell splintered racial gangs become a family, because Ms. G (Gruwell) really ""sees"" her students and dismisses their uninspired excuses. She is undyingly committed to their greatness. As Erin, Swank really walks the walk. She is absolutely powerful. In giving a toast to her class Erin requests, ""The person you were. That person is over."" ""Freedom Writers"" is the most inspiring and touching movie of this young year. ""Freedom Writers"" is about seeing and inspiring greatness in the presence of no possibility, and walking the walk.In 1994 Erin (Swank) is a new teacher at a Long Beach high school teaching freshman English. Reviewing young Erin's reading list, Principal Margaret Campbell (Imelda Stanton) notes to Erin that Homer is entirely inappropriate for her student's elementary reading levels. Campbell instructs idealist Erin to baby-sit her class, because she will not be able to teach them anything of value. If there is one weakness of the movie it is that Campbell is a cold villain. Not knowing much about the history of this story, I would surmise that Campbell was a victim of her own idealism being beaten from her. One of the offsetting strengths is Scott Glenn as Erin's father Steve, who advises Erin to do her time and ""do your job"".Erin's students know that have been written off in this racial charged and divisive classroom. Maintaining order, much less teaching English is a threatening nightmare. With her father's pearl necklace and proper dresses, Erin seems an easy victim. However, Swank gives Erin a beguiling spirit and tenacity. The Blacks, Latinos, and Cambodians stake their territory in her classroom and are unyielding in retreat. Eva (amazing April Lee Hernandez) silences the room and breaks Erin's heart when she proclaims, ""I hate white people!"", and proceeds to justify. Where Erin draws her line in sand is when she sees a racist cartoon of her student Jamal (Deance Wyatt). She schools her wannabe gangsters that their game is not even in the same leagueas the Nazis. The tipping point occurs when Erin along with her Dad escort her class to the Museum of Tolerance as they learn about the Holocaust. Her class even reads ""The Diary of Anne Frank"". Her Dad (Glenn) begins to see Erin's great gift and acknowledges her, ""I admire you"" Erin is dedicated to her students carrying two other jobs so she can buy books and provide aids for her students. However, this comes at a cost. Her husband Scott (Patrick Dempsey of ""Grey's Anatomy"") supports her passion, but with Erin giving her all to her students there is little else left. Here Dempsey is poignant as a good man stuck in selfless path.Hilary Swank is amazing and powerful as Erin or ""Ms. G"". Although this is early in the year, this is an Oscar worthy performance. Swank should only play characters with great passion and humanity. There is an electrifying scene where Marcus tells her Erin, ""That don't fly, Ma!"" Erin reminds her class that she is not their mother. Then Eva and Andre (Mario) tell her that ""Ma"" is a sign of respect. Swank's power is punctuated by her listening and eloquence on screen. She silences the audience when she tells Andre, ""I can see you"" The young cast is equally strong and amazing. Eva Lee Hernandez's performance as Eva is a study in authenticity and courage. Jason Fin as tough guy family outcast Marcus is deceivingly vulnerable and touching. Mario has a commanding presence and charisma as the street smart Andre. Though Eva has the showier role, Mario's Andre gives the movie much of its heart and humanity. Scott Glenn makes a very touching turn as Erin's fatherhe is great. LaGravenese never shies away from the stark hopelessness and violence of this Long Beach school.

The stories are real, the experiences are real, but the tension seems to be missing.The movie does well in explaining what the Freedom Writers are and how
Erin Gruwell changed their lives. What I wish the film did better was delving into the lives of the students, the struggles Mrs. Gruwell faced, and how some events may have affected others.Yes, some of the issues are in this film. But, it feels as if each problem is only a speedbump as the plot progresses forward. One major event that's supposed to have major implications seem to be forgotten for the rest of the movie. Each ""major"" issue ends up being brushed over for the sake of plot and time.But, it's a good movie with a good message. Also, kudos for bringing real Holocaust survivors on this movie.

34,oneloveall,Enjoyable only if you have not seen any other film this subject has offered,4,13 April 2007,"This earnest, highly drab retread into the teacher-overcomes-odds-in-a-tough-school routine is hard to criticize for the unabashedly inspirational slant the writers try to ingrain on their audience, yet is harder to recommend to any cinephiles over the age of twenty due to it's heavy-handed derivative nature. Nothing at all is even attempted to be reworked for this updated, and far less gripping piece of educational uplifting, akin to quintessential ghetto-teacher film Stand and Deliver, and youth appealing Dangerous Minds. Freedom Writers tries to take what made those movies appealing, relevant, and inspiring, and instead synthesizes a two hour after school special with a dash of grit thrown in to mark the studio release.Immediately, the highly clichéd script bombards viewers with some kind of calculatedly cool quotient in capturing a young crowd of inner city students during the mid 90's, becoming a stressful and somewhat embarrassing attempt at staying ""street"" in order to appeal to the young demographic it is catering to, though mainly coming across as a stereotypically soulless ensemble cast, donning a naive and ill-advised screenwriter's sheltered reality. The more these students open up to their teacher about the struggles they face each and every day in the hood, the less you embrace the manipulative and ignorant material coming out of their mouths. Writer Richard LaGravenese definitely knows how to write decent dialog and cover certain groups of society (white yuppies) as his earlier work has continually shown, but it seems being chosen to adapt a script based off of the real life classroom battles waged in legendary room 203 was to forsake any latent authenticity present in this true story.Though the film may indulge in every genre cliché it is afforded too heavily to engage the weary viewer, the movie is not a complete loss. The overall theme remains triumphantly warm to the heart, augmented by the story's true origins and the presence of Hillary Swank. The young and talented actress has a strange habit of making a few Oscar winning films and following through with relatively dead-end projects (something I find strangely appealing in an ego-less sort of way), this definitely falling into the latter category at this point in her career, though her presence alone certainly makes the film more bearable. The under-examined, passionate discourse that flows through her classroom when angry students begin to open their hearts and minds to greater possibilities, cuts through much of the predictably melodramatic dialog that pervades this movie to offer a few genuinely heartfelt moments of tense commentary, though the equation the film offers that gets the students to that point remains questionable. It's heart may be in the right place, but it's vision remains stuck latching onto former, and better, work on this topic.",Freedom Writers
35,JohnRayPeterson,"The Hilary Swank Formula, all out and all the way.",8,18 July 2011,"Hilary Swank is an executive producer of this movie. Swank has chosen to play another powerful real life character, not her first and was not her last or most recent either. Perhaps she has an affinity for roles that are inspiring, moving and certainly memorable. In an earlier review of the movie Conviction II (2010), I commented that I believed she merited a nomination for best actress; the character of Erin Guwell that Swank plays in Freedom Writers is not as dramatic as that of Betty Anne Waters in Conviction, but the movie is another real life story you certainly will remember for it's simple and powerful message. Swank's performance is brilliant, not overdone; it does not overshadow the story itself.I don't know what kind of mark Swank is carving for herself but she is no doubt one of those artists whose name recognition alone is worth a gamble.You will like the movie unless you are in the mood for action or other adrenaline stimulation flick. I recommend it and by the looks of the usual critic references and sources, chances are you won't be disappointed. There are many unknown actors and first timers, but they do a splendid job.

This role selection by Hilary could be with a temptation of giving one more Oscar winning performance, and with Hilary's caliber she plays the character with all perfect nuances and commitment. The method Hilary uses is to draw parallels between the miseries in life of wild, gun  welding youth gangs and the Holocaust; this is done through Anne Frank's dairy, and succeeds in transforming the bunch into responsible Freedom Writers.The movie fails at several fronts. First, it is a totally illogical premise to think that relating the Holocaust with the ghetto urban killing youths. It shows American education system in pathetic state and above all it does a clichéd presentation of non-white youths, which was the most ironic. Throughout the movie I could not come myself in terms with this reality. There are sure some touching moments in the movie that bring tears to your eyes. Yet, the movie's continuity gets distracted by scenes of Hilary's personal rift with her husband. The editing in some parts is fast as if there is a pressure to communicate the point with quick images; it does but does not touch. I kept on getting this feeling as if the director Richard LaGravenese is a Jew, or making a movie for Jew producers with a soft Jew empathy.The direction of the movie could have been much better. I think Hillary with this director Richard could not have given a better performance than this. But one character of a student stands out with an eye catching performance is by April L.Hernandez playing Eva  she play the narrator of this movie and gives her first major noticeable act in Hollywood.Overall an okay movie made on an unacceptable plot line.(Stars 5.5 out of 10)",Freedom Writers

47,guyfromjerzee,"We've seen this formula before, but it's still definitely worth seeing!",8,4 February 2007,"The movie gets off to a slow start, and in the first 20-or-so minutes I thought to myself, ""How is this any different from 'Dangerous Minds' and all those other 'inspirational teacher' flicks? This movie probably has nothing new to bring to the table."" One thing I remember reading from a screen writing book was that you should never tell yourself, ""This has been done before."" You can always make variations on familiar story lines. ""Freedom Writers"" is a fine example of that philosophy. I can't deny that I was crying through almost half the film. The character arcs of the students in this movie are quite convincing. And take it from me, because I can be pretty damn cynical. One thing you can definitely say about this film is there are no saccharine ""Dead-Poet's-Society-esque"" moments with students standing on chairs or crowding into the principal's office in support of their teacher. Yes, the film takes some significant artistic liberties, but never to the point where I was rolling my eyes. One element of the film I deeply appreciated was how Hilary Swank's character equated the gang violence the students experience everyday to the experiences of the Jews during the Holocaust. In a later scene, she takes the students on the field trip to a Holocaust museum, where they are captivated by the Jewish experience. Being that my grandparents were Jewish immigrants during the Holocaust, I couldn't help but cry my eyes out when the students were hit hard by discovering what these people went through. When the students raise money to have the woman who hid Anne Frank speak to the students, one of the students says, ""Can I be the one to escort her into the class?"" That was probably the most touching moment of the film. These touching moments felt genuine, and that's why the film works. Hilary Swank gives another fine performance. Sure, it's not as dynamic as her performances in ""Boys Don't Cry"" and ""Million Dollar Baby,"" but good nonetheless. I like how even during the later moments of the film, she remains a generally jovial person and though she's able to relate to the kids, she's still a square, un-hip white woman. Her performance is probably a lot more convincing than Michelle Pfieffer's in ""Dangerous Minds"" (not to mention the dramatic moments in ""Freedom Writers"" are a little more believable). The actor who plays Marcus is quite good as well, probably giving the best performance out of all the students.I did have some minor problems with the film. For example, English actress Imelda Staunton (though she does a fine job) can't quite nail down an American accent. I also wish the movie, like the aforementioned ""Dangerous Minds,"" could've went for an R-rating. I understand that director Richard Lagravanese probably wanted to make sure that teenagers see this movie, but it feels a little unconvincing watching a movie about inner-city kids where the word ""motherf***er"" is never uttered. But unfortunately we're living in the age of PG-13 movies. Pretty soon, porno flicks will be PG-13. I think the filmmakers were being a little overstated by making the only white kid in class a blonde-haired boy who resembles a close relative of ""The Brady Bunch."" Having lived in an inner-city most of my life, I understand that even the white kids in the neighborhood try to act ""gangsta."" In one funny scene, Swank's character plays a game where the students have to step forward whenever a question applies to them. Most of those questions are things along the lines of ""Have you ever witnessed gang violence?"" The white guy doesn't step forward for any of those questions. When she asks ""Do you know where to buy drugs?"" that's when the white boy finally steps forward. But despite these minor problems, ""Freedom Writers"" is a solid, touching film. It doesn't completely break from the mold of ""inspirational teacher"" movies, but it might be one of the better ones in the genre.",Freedom Writers

And what about the students themselves as they go to their other classes. History, science, math, phys ed etc. Do they cause the same disturbance as in their English class? Seeing the movie it looks like there is only one class these kids attend and one class Erin teaches. Not realistic.

Why not cast teenagers as teenagers?",Freedom Writers
49,blazesnakes9,An mere disappointment,2,5 January 2014,"Education in the movies tend to be serious on having the students become the saviors of their own world. In other words, they are the ones who can save themselves. Many movies about education and high-school students have been praised about their quality and realism to what these kids are going through. Unfortunately, in the case of Freedom Writers, that kind of premise has been seen and heard of in a familiar place. The story of Freedom Writers is based on true events that occurred in the mid-1990's, where Los Angeles high school students formed a writing group of their own. In the beginning of the movie, we are introduced by one of the students who is affected by the 1992 Los Angeles riots. After listening to her own story about surviving on the streets of L.A. during the riots, we are also introduced by Erin Gruwell (Hilary Swank). She is new to the city, partly because she used to live in Newport Beach. Now living in L.A. with her husband, she is given a job to teach at Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach. However, this kind of high school is nothing compared to any other high school in the United States. In fact, this kind of high school look like it was burrowed from other high school movies as well. But, anyway, Miss Gruwell is introduced in her new classroom where the majority of the kids are either black, Latino, Puerto Rican, or white. Of course, these kids are also burrowed from other movies as well. At first, Gruwell is disgusted by the lack of seriousness that her kids hold in their possessions. For example, in one scene, one of the kids pass around a drawing of a Jewish person with a big nose. Furthermore, Miss Gruwell also pushes it by creating more of a scene by saying and stating racial stereotypes such as, blacks have big lips. To me, that's kind of unsavory. Now, anyone can tell you that the story of this movie tries to be fair to what has happened at Woodrow Wilson High School, and also the book, which was written by Erin Gruwell herself and her class. Later on in the movie, she have the students write down their own personal lives in a journal. Some write about surviving on the streets, yet some write about their own personal stories of their lifestyles. One particular student in her classroom writes about having to deal with her family being in distress. The movie goes even further when Miss Gruwell teaches the kids about the Holocaust. She even brings in a Holocaust survivor, who tells her class about her experiences of living in a Nazi concentration camp. Now, that scene is good, but not enough for me to recommend this movie. I know that Freedom Writers is trying to be uplifting and powerful because of what it has in store for the audience. But to me, the movie makes it seem that this true story is created by other high school movies or other education based films. Even more disappointing is the story then turns into a teacher-goes-against-the-system film. We've seen that story be told in other great and wonderful films like Dead Poets Society or Stand and Deliver. Well, this movie isn't in the same league as Stand and Deliver or Dead Poets Society. In fact, the whole idea of having the kids write down their own stories is absolutely ripped right out of Dead Poets Society. The story of Freedom Writers is also predictable. You can even predict every move the movie makes. As for Hilary Swank, she does a good job in the film, but it isn't particularly an Oscar-winning performance. She is a great actress and does have the edge to shape up these kids, but she's the only person and actress alive in this story that is predictable and contrived. What I wanted from a movie like this is to create more of an authentic look of kids, specifically high school students, who are living in this dangerous environment. Of course, I don't mind a movie where young adolescents talk about their own experiences, but having to be recycled from previous projects isn't going to shape or change the way I look at the movie. Freedom Writers isn't a bad movie. It isn't horrible. It just lacks the need of authenticity that these characters possess. ★★ 2 stars.",Freedom Writers

A 23 year old rookie teacher called Erin Gruwell (Hillary Swank) arrives to teach tough kids in an integrated school in Long Beach in the 1990s. The kids are mostly gang members and they are angry and cynical for a reason. Their whole life is a struggle to survive. Not surprisingly the kids have poor reading scores but when Gruwell arrives she decides to teach them Homer and Shakespeare. Gruwell's students are initially rude and hostile. She takes them on trips outside the neighborhood, to show them how other people live and slowly wins their trust. They develop an interest in learning and become enthusiastic about schoolwork, but there are setbacks. The kids have never heard of the holocaust, but they enjoy the Diary of Anne Frank and learn that racism can have evil consequences.Erin has lots of opposition. Her husband (Patrick Dempsey) finds himself neglected, her father (Scott Glenn)worries about the thugs she's mixing with and her boss (Imelda Staunton) and colleagues don't understand why she is wasting her time on these violent losers. Gruwell's students all look closer to 30 than 18 and Swank is 10 years too old to play Gruwel. The film would have worked better with a teacher who looked young and vulnerable.

HernandezNow this film deserves an Oscar. This is a truly moving picture. Wonderful Acting, Wonderful Directing, Wonderful Music, Wonderful Cinematography (I'm using caps to emphasize how good it is for those who don't have common sense). This is truly an Oscar-caliber film. Every minute was entertaining. But this film still does not beat The Untouchables or Vertigo. To tell you the truth, I, at first, did not know this film was based on a true story. Nor did I know that the true story was transferred to a book by the REAL Freedom Writers. Perhaps this picture will show all the people that were like the Freedom Writers were at the start, will now be like the Freedom Writers were at the end. The Freedom Writers were groups of different gang members who were very troubled and uneducated until they actually went to school and paid attention to what the teacher said and respected her. The teacher would actually succumb to their level for a little while and teach in a tactic they desired. Teaching in a ""cool"" tactic. The true story was an inspiration just like the movie was. The movie obviously followed what the true story was like. And this time Instead of saying 'Written by Richard LaGravenese'; it said 'Screenplay by Richard LaGravenese', which shows that he took the true story and put it into the script somehow. He may have manipulated it and fictionalized it in a way, but it is obviously mainly based on the Freedom Writers true story. What a wonderful idea to actually transfer the story to a book and then to a film. What would be really going to the extremes would be to come out with a video game on it just like other films in the past have had. Such as, Harry Potter (books, then movies, then video games); Lord of the Rings (books, then movies, then video games); and Star Wars (movies, then books, then video games); and many others. Another thing that I wouldn't have guessed was that this film was produced by Danny DeVito. Than I thought that maybe he's friends with one of the other producers or actors or director/writer Richard LaGravenese. Erin Gruwell (Hilary Swank) is looking for a job to be a teacher at a high school in a bad neighborhood. She wants to teach badly. The controlling bureaucrat Margaret Campbell (Imelda Staunton) was the one that hired her. When Erin saw what kind of class she would be teaching, she got nervous. I wouldn't blame her either. Being surrounded by a bunch of gang members isn't the most comforting thing in the world. Although she has some troubles the first day, she still remains idealistic, coming up with more and more ideas for the kids to shape up from being naughty gang members to brilliant scholars. Well, maybe good students anyway. As for Erin's husband Scott Casey (Patrick Dempsey), he thinks that Erin shouldn't be teaching a group of low-class kids like that. Although they are low class, that doesn't mean they can't improve does it? No. All they need is a little extra teaching. Well, actually a lot of teaching! Their mind sets are all wrong. They think they should remain loyal to their own race, and if one race invades another races territory, punch or kick or gunshot or beat up completely. One that is especially biased is a girl named Eva (she's strict on how you pronounce her name. She WANTS it pronounced the Hispanic way) (played by April L. Hernandez) who sticks to her Hispanic gang group and won't let anyone of a foreign race come in. Erin decided to have the class do a simple process. She would ask the class questions and they would step on a red line in the middle of the classroom if they relate to the question. Questions include if someone has been shot at, have shot at someone, have friends that have been shot and killed, and knows where to get drugs (white guy steps on the line). This brought them closer together. There are other things that happened like violent scenes including fights with other gang members and fights in the classroom. There was a lot of language, but that is predictable in a film like this. Also, there were cruel jokes that gang members did to gang members of opposite races. This still had them angry with each other. To appease the children, Erin has them read The Diary of Anne Frank and see a girl (Anne) having to go into hiding to hide from the Nazi (German) group. This is also relevant to what the gang members were facing. They went into hiding, remaining isolated from other races so they wouldn't be threatened. Unfortunately, hiding doesn't always help. They seem to be inspired by this story. But some still aren't taught the valuable lesson of treating others as you would want to be treated. But do they change and become good people and spread the word of friendship? Well, according to the movie and true story they do. But do they remain good? That we may never find out.

Now , I'm sure not a lot of people have ever heard of Freedom Writers, but it is about a new teacher who gets her first job at a high school in Long Beach California. The film takes place in 1994 and during that time there was a lot of gang violence and since the schools were integrated, students and even teachers didn't really care about education. This one teacher dedicates all of her time to these kids and to help them and the bond they form is incredible. This made an interesting film and a little hard to believe, even though it was based on a true story.I loved the characters in this movie. Each student had a different story and their storied brought them together. Marcus, Eva, and Jamal are among my favorites. The story really focuses on Mrs. G. and her teaching. She was the best character in the movie with her dedication and love for her job but every time I saw her and her husband on screen I just wanted to turn it off. I understand his purpose and it but it was boring and slowed the pace. Eva and her struggles in her life but in the end it is kind of unsatisfying. She witnessed one of her own people, meaning Latin American, gun down and murder another man and she was to testify in court. Her family and friends told her to lie to protect her own people. They are in a war, and the war is something every student can relate to. In the movie she testifies but we never find out what happens afterMarcus was a character who surprised me. He got kicked out of his moms place when he started getting into drugs and gang violence and he gave up on school. He completely develops into a strong character with an even stronger heart and voice. Mrs. G. tried to teach them about the Holocaust and the Diary of Anne Frank. She thought the kids would relate, and they did and that was a big part in them coming together. Marcus is one character I would say gets justice. His story ends properly and it is satisfying. There were no questions to be asked.Jamal is a character that just drops off the face of the Earth. In the beginning he is very active and he makes an impact, but then he slips away and is kind of forgotten. It's a shame because he had so much potential and strengths as a character. Andre is the opposite. I the beginning he is hardly noticeable and in the end he is a focal point, but again, his story isn't wrapped up. It left me asking, ""ok, then what happened?"" It was frustrating. The movie ends in the right place but we don' know how the kids end with their present problems. We get a blurb before the credits roll but to me it wasn't enough.I like this movie a lot, the way Mrs. G. connected with her students and changed them was just fun to watch. You can't help but feel happy when old enemies become friends. It is even crazier that this was a true story. I think it was exaggerated for Hollywood but they were like a family. Most of them didn't have family and the conflict in the movie is how long they will stay together. At least I think that is the conflict. There really is no major conflict, but more like three or four minor conflicts. It is different and it worked so touché to the director. The Holocaust became a symbol throughout the entire movie. It connected the kids along with the journals and I loved how it was used throughout the entire movie. Jamal was the one everyone made fun of and Tito drew a picture of him with bi lips and Mrs. G. found it in class. She went on a speech about propaganda the Holocaust. None of the students had heard of the Holocaust. She took them to the Holocaust museum and had her talk to Holocaust survivors. Somehow, they connected the Holocaust with their life style. Their stores were all so sad and deep and Mrs. G. really helped them.Her teaching methods for these kids were outstanding. My favorite scene is when she plays the line game. When she first said, ""The line game."" I had the same reaction as the students, which wasn't good. Then she asked the questions and got deeper and deeper into their lives. The students got to understand one another. They got little bits of respect and it was the first small step into a change in their life. The journal entries were absolutely brilliant as well. She had them write in their journals everyday about anything they wished and she would read the, if they liked. The kids just vented. They just told their story and their struggle and it helped Mrs. G. connect and understand with her students. And I'm a writer so I thought it was just smart in general. I had to ask myself, ""Did the students really do all the work? Did they actually read the books?"" in my mind it is kind of doubtful. Students today don't read under normal circumstances. These kids risk their lives walking outside. It is a little hard to believe they actually did all of their work, or even most of it.Overall, Freedom Writers is a good time with strong characters you will fall in love with and feel sorry for, but is also hard to believe. I'm sorry, you can't help but notice how Hollywood and cheesy the story and scenes can be. I still liked it a lot; I could watch it again and again.

54,HanShotFirstGR,An important movie that should be shown in every class!,8,11 January 2021,"Plot:A young teacher inspires her class of at-risk students to learn tolerance, apply themselves and pursue education beyond high school.Analysis:Freedom Writers was based on the true story of a teacher named Erin Gruwell who aimed to overcome stereotypes, a class of disobedient kids and a school who simply doesn't care to win the battle against hate and discrimination. Her only ally is her passion for equality and her belief that any kid can find motivation when they are treated properly. Erin's story isn't just an amazing emotional journey through the hardships an idealist has to face to start a wave of change, it's an inspiration that anyone can find the way out of the downhill in his life and create a brighter future, something that everyone needs to hear once in a while.Richard LaGravenese took a really inspiring story and gave it a documentary-like theme that turned a nice idea into a huge success. Every small scene has an amazing infuence on viewers' minds, they feel real, you can hear the pain, feel the hate, the sadness, the discrimations, everything is designed perfectly for this one to be an absolute blast. The cast was really good and the fact that Hilary Swank and Imelda Staunton were the only really big names helped the movie to be more personal, when you feel that the characters are real, they matter to you more, it's like they actually exist as their problems do in modern society and that's what helps the audience to get emotional and feel empathy for them. Swank was great, she was convincing, she delivered the exact message she was supposed to and gave a respectful performance to tell the story of that woman in the best way possible. Staunton was the incarnation of everything that goes wrong with this society, it's the teacher that discriminates, that doesn't fight for every student, that seperates the kids into good ones and bad ones, the problem of modern educational system summed up in a person and a very good actress to bring out this exact personallity.The story is based on real events and has a more poetic view on them, it's a case that doesn't happen very often, the best example of good teaching and not giving up on people. Some things were done kinda sloppy, there are too many scenes of Gruwell's personal life that try to create subplots but the result is unoriginal and not interesting at all. It would be better for the movie to focus on the original subject and maybe give some more depth for some students rather than using cliché ideas to fill the screentime they wanted. Despite that, the story as a whole remains very good and very important, so the general feeling is still quite positive.Conclusion:Erin Gruwell is one of those people you may never hear their names or accomplishments and movies like this pay respect to their work and selfless personalities. She is an example of how good teaching can be lifesaving and an inspiration for all those students who are being discriminated every single day or afraid that their lives have been destroyed. It's an important movie that combines good dialogue with the feeling of a documentary and a great emotional experience for everyone.Rating: 8.5/10",Freedom Writers
55,TheCasualReviewer,Super overlooked film,8,9 March 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Based on the true story of Erin Gruwell (Hilary Swank), a new teacher who inspires her at-risk students to learn tolerance, apply themselves and to pursue education beyond high-school.REVIEW:
This cast is SO GOOD. A bunch of new actors coming along making me tear up and all that. We all knew Mario could do that knowing he's got a sentimental side with one of the greatest rnb singles ever ""Let Me Love You."" I really loved the dynamic they brought to the table with a seemingly oblivious teacher trying to connect with a group of kids going through rough lives. I really liked the subplot of her with her husband, played by McDreamy, as it felt very real. I related to that in a way. Hilary Swank deserves so much credit for this performance. She had an extremely strong presence in this film that truly inspires a viewer. Her dedication and persistence to not back down and have a breakthrough with her students. April Hernandez was great, Mario, Jaclyn Ngan, Deance Wyatt and Jason Finn were all spectacular. Imelda Staunton was great as the annoying character that was jealous of what Mrs. Gruwell was accomplishing with the kids. If you're looking for a film to inspire you and leave you feeling hopeful this is a great one to turn to. 8.3/10.",Freedom Writers

57,FilmLabRat,great film but conclusion flawed,9,21 May 2008,"this was a great film... I expected clichés and there were some, but it still really got me in a big way. However, I was sorely disappointed at the assumption that a teacher staying with the same students over many years is ideal - the conclusion was flawed. As a teacher, I did this for a few (4th - 5th - 6th) and that was nice in some ways, but I don't think it's always ideal for three reasons: (1) students need new mentor-blood in their lives - teachers have weak spots and one of the problems with homeschooling is that one lifelong teacher prevents students from being well-rounded and growing (2) a gifted teacher can influence a group of kids in one or two years - doesn't have to become like a permanent parent to have impact (3) schools that lack effective teachers need to spread the blessing to other classes and students too - it's good for the school to have an effective teacher impact a new batch of students (perhaps the same result would have come with a new group who also needs it) after a year or two (4) some teachers don't see improvement in a student up close - in their mind, they may have labeled a kid. This can hold a student back in old patterns and prevent growth. Kids need fresh eyes to show them who they are in order to develop healthy identities, to recognize their full potential and gifts. The only positive aspects of the suggested approach would be it's benefit for the teacher - it's easier to not have to start over and encouraging to see the long-term effects up close. There is some benefit for the students in retaining the emotional bonding, in the continuity and healing of trust issues. But should other kids miss out for this benefit for one class? The movie was not a slam dunk for me simply because these issues were not hashed out in conversation, drama and debate for the audience.",Freedom Writers
58,KillerLord,A Very Inspiring Movie!,8,10 October 2008,"The number of movies that address social issues and inspire at the same time are very limited. This movie ""Freedom Writers"" is one of those few movies about a ground reality portrayed for what it is. This movie is about a teacher called by her students as Miss G played by Hillary Swank. The teacher finds her class to be a bunch of students all from very disturbed family backgrounds. The students show their backgrounds in the behavior and all their acts threaten to make her life as a teacher very miserable. Hillary Swank plays the role of an ideal teacher who is willing to go any distance in order to do something she thoroughly believes in. She believes she can make a difference to the lives of these kids and is hell bent on doing so. In the process, she is ready to fight the system, stand up to her seniors and even risk jeopardizing her family. This movie is not just about the struggle of a teacher to do what she believes in at any cost but is also about the bitter reality of gang wars and racism. The movie explores the lives of the students and what has led them into their present states. Hillary Swank is a gifted actress no doubt but there are a few short comings in her act in this movie. Her overall role is decent but not near her best.The movie is very inspiring but it does come with a couple of drawbacks. The transformation is shown to be too ideal. For instance, if you see the movie ""To Sir, With Love"" you are always shown one or two guys who resist the very attempt of anyone trying to touch their life. We, as humans tend to resist change even if it is for the good. The amount of resistance shown to be offered by the students to her attempts seemed a little too less. How much of this movie is accurate in portraying a reality is something I guess only those who are aware of the situation described in the movie will be able to talk about. But one can see that the situation time and now appears to be a bit over dramatic and exaggerated. Trying to change the tone of the movie to be darker when it is meant to be dark could have helped. Though the movie sways a little from realism time and now, we must remember that the movie is not actually meant to be a documentary. I guess one can sideline some of the overdone things because the strength of emotion and message in this movie is inspiring. Some people might go overboard with their criticism of this movie but in the end it has a good and powerful message to convey and I believe one should ignore any and all comments asking you to refrain from watching the movie and simply watch it.",Freedom Writers

Sure, it's cliched and predictable but does that matter ... not really because it's based on a true story (Hollywood style). Swank is an idealist teacher who takes 'at risk' students and turns them into scholars with a quest for learning and, more importantly, for doing the right thing simply because it is the right thing. The movie also illustrates the impact a good teacher has in shaping a human's outlook of the world. Despite being slightly on the longer side - over two hours - I didn't glance at my watch even once. It's a decent, feel-good movie. Best of all, it's true.",Freedom Writers
60,jeromec-2,Maybe I'm just getting old but this had few flaws,10,7 January 2008,"I am a retired teacher. Most of the respondents here are students I would guess. Neither statement matters much. What does is that many of them shed the same kind of tears I did.The plot is easily summarized. A young first year teacher goes to a school that on the surface offers her nothing but problems to be overcome. She is given students who know that school for them is a place to be between 9:00 and 3:30. They can ""stay warm"" as my students used to tell me. (I taught in Northern Canada.) As such, what does it matter what they do or what they learn? They make her stated standard goals almost impossible. She doesn't give up. She keeps on trying to teach, but it is becoming more and more hopeless as the students do everything to convey to her that she's not wanted. She's a privileged white. She emphasizes that by wearing a simple string of pearls to school, which only symbolically confirms their distrust of her. If it's not clear enough, a Latino female tells her plainly and purposely that she has nothing to say that could possibly benefit any of them.This last revelation is something that all good teachers will recognize. Ms. G is taking it on the chin, but she's not going to run out of the room crying. She's going to LISTEN. The very articulate nature of the verbal venom coming her way is what makes Ms. Gruwall that much more stubbornly determined to help them. But how? In many great discoveries accident plays a huge part. No less with Ms. Gruwell's teaching. She discovers they know nothing about the Holocaust, but they know everything about death. They've seen much more than most of us will ever see in our lifetimes.Ms. Gruwall was prepared by her own life experiences. Her righteous indignation of the cartoon sent around the room gave her an opening and she pounced on it, without thinking. Her great skill if that's what it was, came out in the next instant when she was able to connect what caused the holocaust to what caused the gang shootings. She discovered how to deal with the mutual violent animousity in her classroom.Her story was a four-year study in hate. She wasn't just trying to teach grammar, she was trying to teach life. All exceptional teachers do. They know that the curriculum will take care of itself, if ever a universal theme can be discovered in their classroom.She was in the right place to deal with the problems of her students. But how? She had to use what the students would perceive as non threatening. It would have been too early to deal with their lives. They still didn't fully trust her. She started with the ""greatest gangs of all time and the greatest gangsters."" It was in the past. It was ""over there"" and it was certainly a study of hatred. She chose Anne Frank.That more or less is the beginning of the plot line.I watched this as a teacher and marveled at her fearless, skillful handling of those above her. I marveled at how she drove out the uncooperative hatred in her class. I marveled at how she created a family out of her classes. She has rescued 150 students from a situation and made them want to go back and continue the work she started. As one person below noted, the scenes left out were every bit as good as any that were left in. All of the scenes showed a remarkable woman fighting to better her students and she considered no sacrifice too large to make on their behalf.It is about American Education. It is about one very dedicated individual. It is about how others could become just as good if only to find their place, their values, their gifts, their determination, their character and their spirit.As long as we have educators like Ms. G, we have hope. The problem is that there are not enough of them. Too many are too frightened by inept administrations, uncooperative parents, external ""universal"" examinations, and students with whom there does not seem to be any way of reaching.I suspect that the reason teen age boys have been driven to tears in part is because they have been victimized by a dull school with dull objectives that have no Ms. Gruwall's in them, to inspire and lead them to be the best seventeen year olds they can be.. We need good teachers to celebrate who we are, not what some system that demands we become what it perceives is in society's interest.The point for teachers is not to follow Ms. Gruwall and do as she does. The point is to follow yourself and be the best you can be, trite as that seems.10/10 is hardly enough to give this movie.",Freedom Writers

The scene where Hilary has all the kids step on a line if various things have happened to them, or if they have seen them happen was such a turning point in the film.When she takes the kids to a Holocaust museum, you can watch the kids change. I mean, you can really see them change. Then they read about Anne Frank and learn what REAL oppression and fear are about.And when they hatch a plan to bring the woman who knew the Franks and everyone that was hiding with them, you think ""no way"".

Freedom Writers is a far more watered down account of racism and gang warfare, even sometimes stooping to ""Step Up"" levels of bittersweetness. I've still given it a 7 out of 10 because whilst I feel it is inaccurate, the film was thoroughly enjoyable because of its young cast of talented unknowns and an extremely good performance from Hilary Swank with an insightful script to work with.

Many directors of this ""type"" of film tend to feel that they need to have melodramatic music in the film. I applaud Mr. LaGravanisse for his use of hip hop/rap to break the tension.

67,tupungato,Very well acted and provocative,10,17 July 2010,"As a story, Freedom Writers has three clear messages for the viewer: (1) Some children, by no choice of their own, must continually contend with situations that demoralize or threaten them. (2) Once in a great while in the sometimes tragic lives of troubled teens, appears an adult who, through heartfelt concern, makes them aware that they have options beyond their very limited experiences. (3) Devoted and ambitious professionals, though they may do admirable things for their clientèle, can make for disappointing spouses.As a movie, Freedom Writers has no faults. Hillary Swank really seems to capture the personality and understand the work ethic of the teacher, Erin Gruwell. She motivates her students without pretense -- doesn't attempt to hide her middle class heritage or form an alliance by making phoney claims that she empathizes with the teenagers' struggles -- and without gimmicks. Her risk taking and challenging approach proves effectual because she truly wants her students to develop and to realize that they have choices that can lead them out of their dysfunctional community. Though Erin Gruwell's husband frustrates her at times with his lack of ambition and unwillingness to share in his wife's enthusiasm for her work by possibly taking part in a field trip or dinner with her students, he does not come across as poorly adjusted and his complaints do not seem completely unreasonable. That Erin Gruwell one day returns home to find that he has decided to leave her also indicates that she did not want to make compromises either.

But, as a matter of fact leg lovers only play a small part in Freedom writers. Not that I have misunderstood this film, its just....: I guess Hilary Swank strained herself more for having nice legs than for being prepared to play this role. And we all know what Ms.Swank is capable of, not referring to her legs but her acting. To resolve this, Mrs.Swank had no clue how to play this role, neither was she willing to use any of her outstanding abilities for playing this teacher. Its sad to see that even such a brilliant actress fails in this certain role. Yes, for me it just seemed like she was stressed out, always having people around her, who expect some outstanding work, and I guess this time she said to herself: ""..you can kiss my rear unit...""

I finally got the chance two days ago, and let me tell you, the movie blew me away.The beginning of the movie was really good; we are introduced to Eva, a girl living in a neighborhood run down by gangs and nearly daily shootings.Hilary Swank, a woman who has just become a teacher, begins teaching a class (which has Eva in it) that obviously has no structure but is full of potential. Hilary Swank plays the teacher to perfection, and about thirty minutes into the movie, she begins to understand their situation. So she decides to use their situation as a teaching tool and gives them books on gangs and teaches them about the Holocaust. Change is seen growing within the students, but the odds are against the English teacher. Her husband is growing sick of her job, and one of the teachers is so fed up with her that she tries undoing everything Hilary Swank is.All the performances are very convincing, so it is a very touching movie. As the students lose their embitterment you begin to feel for them and at the end it is hard to see them begging for their teacher to remain.However, the movie isn't without its imperfections. The teacher that hates Hilary Swank is devastatingly obnoxious. The actress who plays her does a good job, but its just so annoying seeing her degrade Hilary Swank's reputation among the other teachers. The movie also has a constant barrage of rap/hip-hop songs, and you'll only enjoy it if you like that style of music (which I do not). Lastly, Hilary Swank has several corny lines in there in which she tries talking ""ghetto"" or ""cool"", and I cringed every time.But in the end, those things don't matter. It's an important film everybody should watch for its messages and its ""cool-ness"". Overall, the movie deserves an 8.0/10.",Freedom Writers

This made me hesitant to see it, thinking maybe it was just another retread. However upon learning that the film was based on a true story, it made me more interested in seeing it.Hillary Swank plays Erin Gruwell, a teacher who ends up working with racially charged teens at a Long Beach, California high school. She starts out with a naive mentality that all she has to do is teach them and they will care but eventually she realizes that a change to her approach will get their attention. Her discussions end up revolving around the hate and violence that plague the students' everyday lives, bringing the students to realize that they have more in common than they initially thought. Along the way Gruwell must battle with conservative teachers within the school, who object to her new methods of educating her students. What ends up interesting the students and where the title comes from is the notebooks they are encouraged to write in by Gruwell. She gives them the freedom to write about whatever they want and it becomes a personal journal for most.As mentioned, the story has been done before, but I enjoyed that the film concentrated equally on the students as well as the personal life of Cruwell. The film has plenty of emotion and is a constant reminder to those who are more fortunate than others in this world, that sometimes what most of us consider horrible in our daily lives, is nothing compared to others.",Freedom Writers

73,jp_011205,"Unstable, but Has Its Moments",6,1 February 2007,"We've seen it before. A new teacher overly excited about her job and ability to impact the lives of young people has her hopes shattered by a group of inner city kids. Various obstacles arise along the way while she refuses to give up on them. Her determination and effort in the end are rewarded as her hopes are revived and turned into reality. 'Freedom Writers' has that familiar plot which it transforms into a predictable, yet emotional ride.Inspired by the true story, 'Freedom Writers' stars Hilary Swank as the ambitious Erin Gruwell. Walking through the hallways and peeking into classrooms of the school, she is filled with nothing but excitement on her first day. She's ready to teach and make a difference in the lives of her students. That changes though once a fight breaks out in her very first class. This wake up call warns Erin that teaching may be a lot tougher than she thought. The days pass and difficulty increases, but she just sucks it up and hopes it will all get better soon. It doesn't though, and Erin is now at her breaking point. Just when succeeding with the kids appears to be unachievable an idea comes to her. The result of that idea is greater than anything she could have dreamed of.At the start, Swank overplays the optimistic Gruwell. She makes her just a little too good to be true, and more comical than perky. That quickly fades as time passes. Swank eventually loses the laughs and gains respect as she fits the role like a glove by emulating strength and kindness.The film itself follows the same pattern. Only the pattern isn't entirely consistent. It's similar to when you travel down a neighborhood road. As you drive you experience a smooth ride. Then all of a sudden it happens; you hit a speed bump. The heartfelt and touching occurrences in the film are like the speed bumps. And just like speed bumps, they last for but a short time and, are easily forgettable.All of those instances are like that, except for one. No words can describe the scene where April Lee Hernandez's character, Eva, explains her hate for white people during class, bringing Gruwell to tears. It unquestionably gets an A, as it takes the title of the best scene in the film. The final scene is supposed to provoke almost the same intensity, but doesn't because of it's predictability. Instead of being a speed bump, it's an unwelcome dip in the road.All in all, 'Freedom Writers' is okay. It's nicely written, and Swank is really good. The instability of it's overall flow though does take a tremendous amount of its momentum. So while it does have its moments, I'll choose 'Dangerous Minds' over it any day.",Freedom Writers

75,marcusdean118,Small winded.,4,11 November 2008,"I thought this film was very over dramatized. It thinks its a lot more profound than it actually is. I do not live in America but i struggle to believe that this is what it is like in even 10% of the schools there. The characters are unbelievable and ultimately unlikeable. I wasn't expecting very much going into the film and i got out exactly what i thought i would. An alright performance from Swank, a couple of kids who really annoyed the hell out of me, especially the lead female teenager, who doesn't know who Anne Frank is? Ridiculous.The only recommendable scene in this film was when they had the holocaust survivor come into the school as it was truly a touching moment. I don't know if she was a real Holocaust survivor but I'd be more impressed if she wasn't as it was powerful acting.But that aside, this is a poor film.",Freedom Writers
76,andydreamseeker,Movie Review: Freedom Writers,9,7 April 2007,"Freedom Writers appears to have a typical script. An aspiring young teacher goes out of her way to help and inspire her lowly students. A plot like this can make an inspiring movie. Now add this, Freedom Writers is based on a true story. This gives proximity. It could be a nice movie. Now put Hilary Swank as the lead in the film. This movie could be good with the two-time Academy Award winner starring in it. But in reality you still may not want to watch this movie.I found myself walking into the cinema knowing only 3 things about Freedom Writers: 1. Freedom Writers is the title of the film. 2. The plot is based on a true story. 3. Hilary Swank.Why then watch it?I was intrigued by the film title. I wanted to know what happened to the students and how the teacher helped them. I knew that the students wrote journals. I knew that by writing about our feelings and thoughts it helps in the discovery and development of finding and affirming one's self-worth. Writing is a good outlet for your inner voice to be heard and it needs to be expressed. Writing releases us from the emotional walls that block us in. We felt trapped, stressed and helpless. This usually leads to outwardly negative behaviours. The students in the film showed these effects.I was looking for inspiration. I got more than inspiration. I got hope. Erin Gruwell (Hilary Swank) provided it. When no one cared for the students, she dared. She refused to believe her students were ""unteachable"" as branded by other teachers and the academic system. To begin with, the students did not even want to be helped. But with high moral integrity she showed the highest esteem a human being could get, and yet in her humble words she only wanted to do her job.""To get respect you first have to give respect."" It cannot be truer. Erin Gruwell respected every student in his or her own right. She made it a point to understand and not judge, to look under the surface.The synopsis hardly gives this movie enough credit. Get this. This is a true story. The influence should be greater. This is the real deal. Someone in our society made a difference.After watching it, I had this thought: ""Why hadn't more been done to promote this film?"" I mean this is a film I felt everyone should see. I understand that this film may not have the commercial value of movies that can be more entertaining in the sense that it is not comedic, it is not thrilling, there are no hard hitting action, there are no adventure to be told, there are no mystery to be solved, and it may not even be the most touching movie ever made, but it is a powerful film with a strong message that can be applied to every individual and community.It is powerful because like the students in the film, we had or could have met the same situations in life. Put it simply, we were once or could be teenagers and students, we have different family backgrounds, we go through the similar process of growing up, should you dig deeper into your past and more of these relations should appear. There is a big lesson here to be learned for if we think our problems are big, we probably are not aware of the larger world around us. If we hate or are critical of others it's probably because we do not understand what is really happening. It is all too easy to categorize and stereotype others. When we see one monkey we had seen them all we tell ourselves. But we are not monkeys, we are people, no doubt our diversity in language, culture and skin tone, we are people nonetheless. We do not recognize that we have much in common and we do not give respect enough to each other.We fill the world with images of war, violence and hate. Why? Is this the right thing to do? If that is all the young ones get exposed to then these will be what we will get. What values are we imparting to the world? We couldn't care less could we?I like the way director Richard LaGravenese detailed the scene in the beginning of the film where the two senior teachers paid attention to Erin Gruwell's pearl necklace when first introduced to her. I'm quite sure the intention was to reflect how most of us view the world around us. I leave you to figure it out.Lastly, Freedom Writers say you can make a difference. I say you can start by watching this film.",Freedom Writers

82,TaZmAnOO7,Terrible Movie and Blatant Propaganda,1,25 February 2007,"I sat down to watch this movie with a completely open mind - Not only does the film have a ludicrous story but it was also full of constant unnecessary propaganda.Firstly, the film is not believable in any way, nor does it tackle the REAL ethnic issues raised in the movie. Instead, it is a complete whitewash and I find it absolutely ludicrous and quite frankly laughable that the theme throughout the movie is for underprivileged blacks, Hispanics, Chinese etc. to be forced to learn about the Jewish holocaust and Anne Frank to solve all their problems(!) - What a load of absolute tripe! - Are you kidding me??? Who on earth came up with this drivel??? The constant Jewish history references throughout the movie became completely tiresome, forced and unnecessary. I felt like I was being brainwashed rather than being entertained - it really ruined this movie for me. Why do Hollywood directors constantly feel the need to shove this kind of drivel down people's throats all the time??? It wasn't even done subtly... I found the film offensive to all the real ethnic minority students who are facing real hardship everyday - It is completely insulting to ignore the real issues facing these students and instead use this film to force Jewish history onto viewers. Why do this? It was so unnecessary...Also - I found this film to be offensive to any non-whites - it portrays all ethnic people as losers, no hopers and dumbasses whilst making white people out to be better. The way all the teachers were white was also not realistic. They really should have made the lead actress black, and used American black history lessons as the main theme in this movie...

It's a human story and she plays a very human part. Great job.Her conflicts with her home life are a bit too on the nose, as her husband's personality is revealed too quickly, and we see throughout the story too soon how the relationship will pan out.But her connection with the kids, the personal stories they tell, and her unrelenting strategies to reach a selfless goal for them have the audience cheering for the entire group.

I knew stuff about that type of culture and I knew things like that happened but it was different seeing it on the screen. It hit a huge home run with me for what some kids have to deal with.Now the people they picked for this movie, they are AMAZING actors! I actually forgot they were acting and saw them completely as the characters they were playing and that's what's supposed to happen.There were at least 3 scenes if not more that brought tears to my eyes. I watched it one afternoon and I instantly had my dad watch it since he loves movies like ""Dangerous Minds"" and ""To Sir with Love"". He actually got emotional too, and that's very rare for both of us.I have hardly ever cried in any movie but I came close in this one! And it wasn't just because bad stuff were happening, that's not the scenes I felt touched in. It was when they went to the Holocaust Museum for the first time and met real survivors. There's another deeply moving and emotional moment that I won't give away.It's a little long but lets just say this had my attention and complete focus through the whole 2 hours. I didn't even realize at first that this movie was that long. It was just so riveting, raw, and real. I think that it really is up the the caliber with ""To Sir with Love"" and even more powerful then ""Dangerous Minds"".Hilory Swank gives another outstanding performance as Mrs. G.

They understood that they were not the only sufferers. They were not alone. They understood one another better. Ms.G made them write letters to the woman who helped Anne Frank hid from the German, and arranged an educational trip for them. They saw the pain she took to send each of their letters, and acknowledged her efforts in bringing a change. She gave her best, and wholeheartedly wanted to help them make sense of their lives. She wanted them to understand that life is not just about gang life, communal rivalry, upholding racist views, fights and gunshots. Her labor towards helping these troubled kids is commendable.The kids wanted to be known, to be understood, and to matter. Mrs.G gave them this scope through the final project that she had for them.

Hernandez is excellent, the real second lead, and if this doesn't get her more work, their ain't no justice. As a former teacher I was amused that they showed her with only one class. My wife and I agree that dramatically her first meeting with the class would have benefited by showing her with a ""normal"" class first. First day, getting along as expected--because she is obviously a strong teacher--then, ""booomb"" chaos. I didn't like the character that Dempsey played, which is the point I guess: she is very strong, he is without ambition. To be sure, we are told that her 'father"" thinks he was a bad choice. The chemistry between Swank and Scott Glenn is excellent. He is outstanding. I would nominate him for an Oscar, because he does everything a supporting actor is supposed to do.

88,joeydean61869,Mrs. G should be an inspiration to adults and kids alike,7,27 January 2007,"*** out of **** starsDirector Richard LaGravenese does not need to offer excuses for his extremely affecting film, the latest in a long line of white-bread-teacher-inspires-the-barbarians stories. Set in 1994, Freedom Writers stars Hilary Swank as real-life, idealistic teacher Erin Gruwell. With no experience as an educator, yet greatly and naively optimistic, Gruwell is urged into the cruel lives of a classroom of obstinate Freshman students, who themselves have had the misfortune of growing up in gang-ravaged Long Beach, California. The 14 and 15 year old kids live according to the criteria of inner-city traditionalism; Blacks stick with Blacks, Hispanics with Hispanics, Asians with Asians, etc. Right or wrong, each tribe protects their own or they pay the consequences. Swank's canny, come-at-able performance is circumvented and humbled by a talented batch of fresh-faced players, lead by April Lee Hernandez who is cast as Eva, a Latina gang member. LaGravenese first uses Eva as a blueprint for the psyche of every student in Mrs. G's classroom with a heartbreaking soliloquy. Every pupil, no matter their race, cannot see Woodrow Wilson High School as anything but a waste of time, until Gruwell teaches them that they each live with hardships that are nearly identical.There's a scene where Mrs. G has forged a line through the middle of the classroom. She collectively asks a series of questions: Do you know where to get drugs? Have you ever been shot at? Do you know anyone in prison? Has anyone close to you ever been killed? More than one? Two? Three? If the answer to any question is yes, he or she must step up to the line. With every inquiry, just about every student reaches it, which enlightens them to their similarities. Gruwell familiarizes them with the Nazi holocaust: racial discrimination at its extreme. The lesson? If their hateful tribalism continues, the future will become horrifying. They are eventually so inspired by Gruwell that they succeed, through various fund raisers, at meeting Mies Gies, the woman who hid Anne Frank from the Gestapo.Along with the challenges she faces with her students, comes adversity with the faculty, with Principal Margaret Campbell (Imelda Stanton) at the helm. Gruwell's ""unorthodox teaching methods"" threaten their misguided sensibilities. They view her as a coddler, not a ""true"" educator.There are several tear-jerking and heart-rending moments in this film that should touch the most callous of hearts. There is so much tragedy in every student's life that an all-inclusive movie could be made about any of them. Now, here's my thesis: I watched Freedom Writers with my wife and daughter on a Friday night. Big mistake! Teenagers clogged the forward aisles, giggling, chatting, playing with their cell phones...running in and out of the theater five and ten at a time. This happened throughout the entire film! To say the least, it was distracting and irritating. So something occurred to me: shouldn't a movie like this sober bratty youngsters into silence and submission? Why weren't they inspired? I suspected that most of them had little regard for their benefits and came from affluent families, which makes me regret to say that I had greater respect for the children toting guns on the screen than I did for the ones toting I-Pods in the theater. Mrs. G's extraordinary gift of knowledge and enlightenment for the disadvantaged sadly bypassed the advantaged. All the movie watching adults recognized what they long to see in their children, and all the movie watching children recognized what they long to see in a text message! I truly hope Freedom Writers will influence privileged (and when I say privileged, I mean those who at least don't live in poverty) American teenagers to recognize faithful compassion, and that true gifts in life do not come with a price tag attached to them.",Freedom Writers

April Hernandez was beautiful as Eva and I really believed the transformation that her character went through. There were some parts of the plot that bothered me though, I found the situation with her husband predictable in a bad way and I felt like it was an aspect of the story that was not totally seen through by the film-making team.

They should have left it out completely or better developed the idea and the emotions surrounding it.It was overall a decent story, but I wasn't thrilled or moved to tears.

Is that how most people obtain their social conscience -- by a little thinking and a lot of anger? Maybe. And grade school is a chance to think a little more. And with leadership from the teacher, the students in this movie were gradually developing their thinking skills...not just re-arranging their biases. So many things were left unsaid in the movie. That is okay. There are powerful things to be said about ""white people"" (if there is such a group) in social justice debates. The ""9"" was deserved for portraying a plausible episode when students began the road to true justice. Some of the methods might come right thru the screen and do some good.",Freedom Writers

Driving to the theater, calloused me thought I wouldn't be moved by this same old story line; but I couldn't have been more wrong. The students are her co-stars, and Hilary is brilliant. Can you remember when you were sorry to see a movie end? That's how we felt tonight. The ""Freedom Writers"" music is a clever blend of modern music, and it is done in a way that appeals to the young and the old.

Anyway, when something re-hashed, pre-chewed, and half-digested comes out of Hollywood, just follow the money trail.

It's about a giddy, do-gooding teacher, trying to make a difference by teaching a class full of hoodlums. I'm not sure if the director wanted to make you care about these high school thugs, I imagine that he must have, but was completely ineffective in doing so. The movie is totally unrealistic and it rips off other movies without any shame. On the school grounds it even identifies the social groups within the student body in the EXACT same way that Ice Cube did in Higher Learning. I mean, they didn't even make an effort for original thought here. It's not that it was an unwatchable film like, Urban Menace or something, it was just boring beyond belief. This film was nothing more than a bunch of rip offs smeared together in a totally predictable mess. I will say that the second half of the movie may have gotten substantially better, but I wouldn't know because I turned it off at the hour mark.

Young teacher meets a class of underachievers, are openly hostile at first; she wins her over in time, until they eventually cling on to her at the moment of parting.Predictable? Perhaps...But the twist to the somewhat stereotyped plot was the subplot of the LA gang scene, along with the surprising subplot of the plight of the Jews in World War II... the Holocaust.Go figure that one out, but the result was an emotion-filled, inspirational movie. Throw in the lead role's domestic troubles which came at a time when one would have expected a spouse's all-out support and you get the picture.All one needs to do is look at Hilary Swank's eternally smiling face and one quickly forgets she is playing a character and rallies behind her when her character's husband, played by Patrick Dempsey, opts for a divorce.What an ass, one is driven into thinking!

112,sjsully,Uplifting and Inspiring,9,7 January 2007,"On the surface this movie looks like your typical formulaic school film. Don't be fooled. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The acting, led by Hilary Swank, Patrick Dempsey, not to mention the other dozen or so actors (Particularly April Hernandez) who play the students, really make the characters authentic and their plight believable. The movie takes place in Long Beach, California, during the aftermath of the L.A. riots, where the tensions among the four main racial groups (Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and Whites) in the L.A. districts, are at an all time high. This fact coupled by the emergence of inclusion in the public school system no doubt made for an extremely difficult challenge for any teacher. What we see here is an inexperienced, beginner teacher come into this difficult situation and flourish; a woman, perhaps a bit too idealistic, perhaps a bit too naive at first, but through perseverance, dedication, and kindness, steps up and helps guide a group of at risk teenagers into a more positive direction, and more importantly, helps them find out who they are. How could one deny such a positive film?Being a teacher myself, I can honestly say that many of the issues that take place throughout the film with regard to the teaching profession are realistic - the issue of being underpaid (quite simply a sad fact in North America), an administrator or tenured teachers resentment or bullying of a new teacher (the majority are good but some aren't), how teaching is a lot more than a 9-5 job (it cuts into your social life very much). You really get the feeling that those involved in making the film took great respect and did their research. Credit goes out to the screenwriter, Richard LaGravanese and the teacher herself, Erin Gruwell.My only complaint about the movie would be how it portrays the area of Long Beach, California. Viewers will get an image of the area being an extremely violent place to live, where drive-by shootings and gang wars are as common as the mail being delivered to your door. This simply is not true. I've spent some time in Long Beach and I can honestly say it seemed like a really safe place to live. Also, the people there were very friendly. At no time did I feel I was out of place, mistreated, or discriminated against by any other ethnic groups there. Although these problems may arise from time to time, you have to understand it is not the norm. To the credit of the director, it was probably used to affect plot and such.Nonetheless, this is a wonderful film. Funny, warm-hearted, and inspiring. A movie that is certainly worth your eleven dollars. Great job!9 Stars.",Freedom Writers

But as a teacher in San Francisco Unified, I saw her acting as lacking authenticity and insight into how her character would have had to adjust her attitude as well as the way she spoke to her students. Her acting was just not appropriate for the sensitivity and insight needed to get through to kids that are struggling as much as those kids were. She was a bit too assuming and sing-song, (which might work in other demographics) but in that context her character appeared patronizing. Kids can smell that from a mile away and there is no way that character would have had such successes. Her acting just lacked authenticity.",Freedom Writers
115,ameh1,A Force of Nature,8,10 January 2007,"As the movie ended and as I left the theater, I was once again consumed by similar feelings and emotions that had engulfed me when I was watching ""Boys Don't Cry"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"". It is like being in the presence of one of the Forces of Nature, sublime and all powerful. A beautiful creature, at once strong and vulnerable, determined, but compassionate and forever giving. The question is who was I watching; Hilary Swank the Actress or Erin Gruwell, the English Teacher, who had transformed, forever, the life's of a few young men and women, inspiring them with hope, and the knowledge and strength to confront the prejudices and ignorance of their elders and survive into adulthood.I have come to the conclusion that it is a combination of both, and consists in essence an accurate representation of Erin Gruwell mixed in with certain elements of Hilary Swank's personality, that seem to harmonize with the character she portrays. The end result is something that is real, uninhibited and bold, filled with a passion and enthusiasm in doing the right thing, unafraid to express her emotions and willing to sacrifice all, for what she considers to be true and best for the students. Willing to accept without reservation or anger the consequences of her action in her personal and professional life. Again who am I talking about, is it Hilary Swank or Erin Gruwell.Hilary Swank the actor has managed to bring to life with such precision and accuracy, words that were written on a piece of paper, into a living breathing all consuming force of nature. Transforming what could be considered ordinary and repetitive material into a beautiful piece of art. As an actor, she is like an anchor, the solid foundation on which all the various elements of the film are built, it is through her spirit and personality that the actors who play her students, her husband and her father (played with intelligence by Scott Glen; one would have liked to see more of the wonderful interaction between the two of them), emerge strong and confident ready to meet her challenges, making the movie an extremely well performed, well executed and an accurate portrayal of what is a real life story. Her performance is bold and unselfish, allowing the other actors to flourish. I am always amazed at the sometimes physical nature of her performance, her face is like a window into the very depths of the individual she is playing, she is able to express and feel with amazing clarity and without ever saying a word, every emotion and every thought that crosses the mind of her character at any given moment. With a quickness and perfect timing, she can be angry and determined and in charge one minute, vulnerable or sad another, excited and happy the next, This time, she has to speak and lecture or motivate, When she speaks the words don't seem contrived or false, they are passionate and seem to emerge from somewhere deep within her soul, natural and powerful. She has read and absorbed every word that has been written, every aspect and nuance of the person she is supposed to be, and the objectives and goals of the story that is to be told. She has understood every instruction and direction given to her. This basic knowledge and understanding, gives her the freedom and courage to do what she wants and make the character her own. The end result is a fearless performance where nothing is held back, making what seems difficult and complex seem authentic and real; and so one begins to appreciate the dedication and enthusiasm of Erin Gruwell, her wholehearted commitment to her students, her personal sacrifices, and her compassion.One cannot help but wonder, if this movie will inspire the good teachers to come out of hiding and shed the shackles of their mundane and wasted existence, as well as empower students to demand the attention and sacrifice of their elders. Or, if we the audience will somehow awaken from our deep slumber, to appreciate the effort and energy that has gone into telling a story that is as old as Hollywood itself, making the task of the actors and creators all the more difficult, to rise above what is a well trodden path, and convince the skeptical and jaded, that this is real and that it actually happened. That they are able, to a certain extent, achieve this objective is amazing. One has to admire the courage and fortitude, and the talent and skill with which Hilary Swank embraces this story, unafraid of the consequences of failure, just like Erin Gruwell and her students.The movie is very well written and directed; when combined with the power of Hilary Swank's performance and that of the actors that play her students; we cannot help but to admire its honesty and righteousness. As the bonds between students and teacher strengthen, we the audience are captivated and disturbed, we begin to search within our souls for that lost idealism, for lost hopes and forgotten inspirations, as we submit all our innocence and compassion to an existence that is material and subjective. Words such as Hope and Inspiration, Honesty and Compassion, belong to our mythological past, long forgotten, and buried deep within the sands of time, leaving us with cheap and ugly imitations of their true essence and universal nature. Reality is such that it is boring and repetitive, and we fear and hate it. Words such as hope can only have one meaning, and since we human beings are weak, and incapable of sustaining greatness, we have to often find the courage to fight corrupt systems and be inspired and motivated to achieve great things.",Freedom Writers

It is backed up by a compelling story with some serious action to fit. This is by far the best MTV movie to date, which may not sound like much at first, but this film trumps many recent flicks, and that IS saying something because it's been a pretty decent year. I guess my overall point is that you can be a very picky moviegoer, a very sensitive person interested in the life of the less fortunate, or just your average movie fan, and love this film like I did.I will add, this movie may look like it at first glance, but it is NOT about angsty teens, and it does not put ""gangtas"" on the pedestal.",Freedom Writers
117,stumattana,A Surprisingly Objective View of Educating,10,16 January 2009,"WARNING! SPOILERS CONTAINED.Within this genre, classics like ""The Blackboard Jungle"" and ""To Sir With Love"" and movies since all have one thing in common. They present the case for educating street kids without thoroughly exploring all the issues that principals and department chairpersons must grapple with in the oversight of such education. Traditionally, in these movies, the only obstacles that they face are their own prejudices and/or defeatist attitudes.Freedom Writers is different, daring to explore the more plausible arguments against the type of education advocated by Erin Gruwell. English Department chairperson Margaret Campbell, brilliantly played by Imelda Staunton, is Erin's nemesis, and yet, her arguments, though typically offered with a tone of intolerance and vengeance, are nearly always plausible. Erin's fellow English teacher Brian Gelford is another nemesis who makes his arguments undiplomatically, but well. For example: 1) When Erin wants to take books from the library for her students, Margaret notes that historically, students from Erin's class have done damage to books issued to them, authorizing issuance of only the cheapest books, 2) When Erin suggests to Brian that her students would relate to Anne Frank's story, he notes that the school's teachers are the ones who live in far greater fear than ever before since the recent integration initiative. Sociological reasons put aside, the number of students involved in criminal acts has risen dramatically. Even if short-sighted, it is a reasonable observation, and his fear is understandable, and 3) Erin's suggestion that she be permitted to remain with her students beyond their sophomore year meets with resistance from Margaret and Brian, as it a) raises issues about who is qualified to teach juniors, b) deviates from a long-standing formula for education in her school perceived to be successful, and c) may not be practical, even by Erin 's admission, as a long-term approach to education in the school.These are just a few examples of how Freedom Writers skillfully, and objectively, considers some of the more difficult issues that educators must grapple with in determining how to best educate kids from the streets. For me, the objectivity with which Freedom Writers considers subjects such as these is refreshing and helps the viewer to understand how difficult it can be for a teacher with the best of intentions, even one in the midst of clear-thinking (though possibly short-sighted) colleagues who genuinely care about all the students. The inner tension of the movie between Erin, Margaret and Brian is a big part of what makes this movie work, heightening the viewers appreciation for what Erin accomplishes.I highly recommend this movie.",Freedom Writers

But apparently, she just wants to be a cool Hollywood celeb.*yawn* (Hmm...now that I think about it, maybe she wasn't ALL that good in Boy's Don't Cry.)The reason I feel this way is that this movie teaches us nothing new about the human condition (like all good art should).

122,khorasanimgn,motivating,8,29 June 2019,"Freedom Writers is an inspiring movie which is about an enthusiastic teacher who sacrifices her time and even, her personal life to educate disenchanted ethic-minority students. The film is based on a true story and a book named ""The Freedom Writers Diary"" by a teacher named Erin Gruwell.The movie is a 2007 drama directed by Richard LaGravenese and starring Hillary Swank, Scoot Glenn and Patrick Depsey. Swank performs as a school teacher in a terrible neighborhood and tries hard to create an extraordinary bond with her students which is based on emotion, love and trust.Freedom Writers, irrespective of propounding racial issues, is a really entertaining movie which can amuse the audience until the last moments. One of the best aspects of the film is the actors who performed in students' roles since their performances are quite believable and real. In addition, Swank presented a great performance as a compassionate teacher who tolerates many difficulties to motivate her students.However, I suppose despite the fact that the first half of the movie is totally convincing and moving, it turns to be nonsense and the teacher behaves in a silly way when she loses her marriage and then, decides to stay with the kids. It may seem honorable in the surface, but the type of the personality that is presented for her should be able to figure out a solution to balance both aspects of her life. In addition, the ending is completely predictable and from the first moments, it is possible to find out that the young teacher's effort and dream about educating troubled students will come true and face serious problems with her husband.To sum up, Freedom Writers is pleasantly amusing and it is worth watching once, although it is not one of my favorite ones.",Freedom Writers
123,Ken123456789,Freedom to Not Watch This Movie,3,27 September 2008,"Freedom Writers(2007)Mrs. Gruwell(Swank) is a new teacher at Wilson High School in Long Beach, California. She is from a good neighborhood and is shocked when she sees the quality of the students at Long Beach. Mrs. Gruwell is dedicated to her job though, and will stop at nothing to turn the school around. This was based on a true story. Freedom Writers has poor character development. Mrs. Gruwell just barely avoids being the perfect girl. Her problems are just that she is a little dorky and her marriage runs into few tiny problems while at Long Beach. Steve Gruwell(Glenn) is even less developed that Mrs. Gruwell, as he is just a role filler. The main problem of the characters is the students. They act as just one group, and not as individuals. The film never takes any times to show us in depth any of their problems. There's the guy that has problems with his dad, the guy that saw his friend get shot, and the girl that has problems with her dad, but that's as far as they go. Also, the students change way too quickly and put their problems behind them pretty easily. It's interesting that Freedom Writers is based on a true story, but the execution on bringing the story to film was done poorly. Most of the time it's either predictable or melodramatic. The saddest part of it is that they try to make it dramatic when they read Anne Frank's Diary. It could almost be called copyright infringement. Going into the movie you know everything is going to turn out alright, but the film doesn't even try to put us in doubt. There are barely any obstacles put in the freedom writers dream of becoming fine, outstanding citizens. We have the vice principal that doesn't approve of what Ms.Gruwell is doing, but that's the biggest obstacle in their path. Also, the ending is watching the freedom writers type their story and a small argument on whether Mrs. Gruwell can teach the students in their Junior and Senior years. Fascinating. The directing of Freedom Writers is bad because the director never creates an effective atmosphere. We never really feel the pain that the students are going through. The lighting is very bland and never helps create a mood. He never uses the right shots to maximize the setting's potential. The cinematography is also bad, as it appears they could've filmed this on a cheap camera and film. When you have 35mm film looking like 16mm film, you know something's wrong. The music is overdone and melodramatic, but with the quality of the writing it would be hard to avoid. On the upside, we do have some pretty good songs that fit the film perfectly. I will also say though it is obvious they tried to make a good movie. The actual acting of Freedom Writers is OK, but the casting was terrible. The students of the film are supposed to be 14/15, but we have actors that are 20 to 27 years old playing them. I did a little research into this and the youngest of the actors was seventeen years old. This makes many lines come off as extremely camping. We one actor says,""Even though I have only lived a short fourteen years, I have seen many things."" It makes you think the next line coming is "" When I was twenty two years old, I changed my identity to a fourteen year old, because having been held back eight years was too embarrassing.""BAKED FRESH BOTTOM LINE 3/10Pros: Songs Interesting that it's based off a true story They tried! :)Cons: Character Development Poor execution of story Directing Music CastingRating Information PG-13 1.

126,scorpiofrenz,Hats off to the team...a must watch for all!,10,1 January 2008,"What is freedom? Those of us who are blessed to do whatever we want, and whenever we want can possibly never understand what some people go through every single day of their lives! Their existence is a struggle..their life is a battle....and they fight for survival and yearn for freedom every day of their life! ""Freedom Writers"" is an inspiring story of such people.Based on a true story of high school students in Long Beach, California in the 1990s, it is a very inspiring and touching movie. The story revolves around Erin Gruwell (Hillary Swank), a first time teacher in Wilson High School, who is assigned a freshman English class which is a diverse group of racially charged teenagers. The kids are rebellious; they have been taught to fight for their ""own"" people all their life. Racial conflicts and wars take a priority over education. As the story progresses, we see the transformation of the students, and the efforts of the teacher. Erin's teaching methods and ways to connect with the students touch the heart and leave a long lasting impression on the mind.As far as performances go, Hillary Swank has done a swell job! She is Erin Gruwell to a T! Some of the other strong performances include April Hernandez (as Eva), Mario (as Andre), Deance Wyatt (as Jamal), Jason Finn (as Marcus).All in all, a very impressive movie. A must watch for everyone who likes true stories, or needs some inspiration in life. The movie truly motivates you to take life in its stride, and work towards making it better, rather than succumbing to unfavorable circumstances. This powerful and poignant movie will definitely make a lasting impression on your heart!",Freedom Writers
127,deeell,Good,7,3 January 2008,"This movie moved me, and really did make me cry. however, i felt that it could have been a lot better. It reminded me of Mr. Holland's Opus, and the two stories are very similar, but Dreyfuss's character instead uses music, rather than writing, to inspire his students. Freedom Writer's story is a wonderful one. There's nothing more emotional than seeing a group of African-American gang and ghetto teens transform into critical thinkers, bond with each other, and see a world of hope outside gang life. However, unfortunately, I have to say that Mr. Holland's Opus was the better movie. Holland taught for 30 years, and went on to see tremendous success in some of his students (governor, school board official, soldier, etc). In this one, Gruwell's story ends immediately as the kids go into their junior year, and she herself left the high school only after several years (when her freshman class graduated). True, the real person did that, but movies are meant to bend and alter real-life events, right? The movie ended very suddenly, without any explanation other than the fact that she was allowed to teach the students in their junior year, and that most of them went to college afterwards. What did they do at college? Drop out? Graduate with top honors? A little section depicting their adult life would have been nice, as in Mr. Holland's Opus.Overall, this isn't a film to be missed. It has a great story, and, though a bit short and has its drawbacks, is definitely worth watching.",Freedom Writers

129,hiddenwave93,Inspiring movie that will warm the cockles of your heart,8,16 May 2012,"This movie starts out at a school in the vicious streets of Los Angeles. Hilary Swank plays Erin Gruwell, a new excited school teacher who leaves the safety of her hometown, Newport Beach, to teach at Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach, which recently put an integration plan in place. She gets a wake up call, however, when she realizes that her class is full of ""at risk"" students otherwise known as ""unteachables"". The high school students break into racial groups, fights break out, and most of the students even stop attending class making Erin Gruwells' job harder than she imagined. Not only does she have a hard time with her class-mates, but she also faces a hard time with the department head who believes that the students can't be taught and shouldn't be bothered to even read books, because they'd just tear them apart and write all over them. This movie does a great job of portraying the lives and struggles a teen in downtown Los Angeles must face alongside getting an education. The acting is done so well in this movie that I didn't even know any of these actors were just from the streets of Los Angeles and weren't professional actors. This film reaches out to any individual who doesn't believe there's hope or change to be had. By the end of this film, I think many people will compare their struggles to the ones of the people in this film and hopefully realize that life isn't as bad as they think it is. This film is 100% relatable to probably anyone and if you can handle some emotional parts, it's worth the watch.",Freedom Writers

It surprised me, because, in my opinion, it was actually better than the other movies I saw that were similar. The fact that it is a true story was one thing that made it stand out in the beginning. There is also the way The neighborhood, and school is portrayed, because it is very accurate to the time it depicts, showing the war that was going on, and the real struggles that the students had to deal with on a daily basis. The movie was so real, because it was true to the way high school students act, and the problems they faced, not putting a facade over anything to water down the truth, it shows what really happened. The actors in this movie did an amazing job. Hilary Swank led the way with a cast of not as well-known actors, who stood out and graced the big screen with their talents of conveying the truth. They added to the success of the movie, and helped develop the theme of education, and how it can really help people, and that it isn't just some cheesy plot in an inspirational ""teacher"" movie. It was so real that it stirred up emotions in everyone at the theater I was at, and I am not a person who cries at movies, but this movie made me feel like crying. There are such intense moments, and so many messages, and truths brought out in the movie, that it is really eye opening. It is a reminder that a little effort can make a big change. I would recommend that people go see it, because it is a very well done movie with a brilliant storyline.",Freedom Writers

It's a feel-good movie which, while not entirely avoiding clichés, manages to be a solid 'message movie' and great entertainment at the same time. It is sometimes very emotional (the highlight being a school visit by someone from WWII era) but never melodramatic.Swank avoids all opportunities for going OTT and gives a carefully contained lead performance. She's too much of a pro to hog the limelight and allows her younger co-stars (students) space to perform. It's great because she allows us to identify with a character that could have easily become a cliché. Scott Glenn and Imelda Staunton are both excellent in small roles. Patrick Dempsey plays the estranged husband and acquits himself well.Bottomline: 10/10 Well worth watching",Freedom Writers

I'm am however tired of wrighting these reviews for my film appreciation class because i know no one is going to read it. i would suggest this movie you like the classic typical Hollywood happy ending.

133,Citizen_J10,Somewhat clichéd but with a powerful undertone,7,11 November 2008,"The Freedom Writers isn't groundbreaking, unique or even very fresh in any way. That doesn't mean, however, that it can't be enjoyable.The theme of the movie is of the sort that guarantees emotional scenes and powerful sub-plots. The potential problem is that the movie comes off as too heavy-handed, unrealistic or sappy. Freedom Writers doesn't completely avoid this trap and the biggest reason for that is the performance by Hilary Swank as the main protagonist whose journey at guiding these teenagers is at the heart of the story.Don't get me wrong, Swank wasn't horrible and she's definitely a good actress. However, the viewer doesn't really get a sense that she's able to connect with the troubled kids as remarkably as the plot suggests. Swank gives a couple of powerful speeches but she doesn't convince me enough - to put it simply, the charisma isn't there. The type of teacher that she represents must be a very charismatic person but she comes across mostly as a dorky and boring kindergarten teacher. The edge just simply isn't there.The theme of the movie is moving and the plot is simple yet powerful. There's no need for twists or dramatic climaxes - the movie is about the everyday struggle of the teenagers and it portrays it well enough. Some of the scenes where the students bond with each other are a bit cheesy but not so much as to be distracting.The plot is moving and despite of its traditionality still intriguing. The main problem of the movie is that the core of the movie lacks edge, charisma and electricity. The ""it"" factor isn't there. Some of it is because of Swank and some of it is because of the clichéd plot.Touching but clichéd, moving but in some ways a bit forced. This movie is not a masterpiece and it evokes contradictory responses but one thing is for sure - the movie is worth watching. It may have its flaws but the message and the powerful undertone is still something that doesn't leave you cold when you finish the movie.",Freedom Writers

While the movie is based on a true story, Hollywood skews it just a bit, which could make or break the film for certain viewers. Additionally, I have been unimpressed by MTV films in the past, namely Hustle & Flow. However, this is certainly not the case with Freedom Writers; the story is incredibly touching, the emotions real, and the feel unlike any other January movie I've ever seen.

So align yourselves with people that have that spark and move forward together.Human thoughts, human actions, human outcomes, this is one message that this movie teaches.

I think the fact that instead of forming a picket line to express dissatisfaction over how she was being supported, this teacher responded out of a character that said, ""I will do whatever it takes to help students discover who they can become.""

As much as America advertises itself as a brilliant country to live in (the land of opportunity) this film really does bring things down to earth.A must see for anyone who enjoys a good film.

Granted, it's not an Oscar-worthy film, but it did stand pretty tall, in my eyes, in it's own way. Hilary Swank turned in a really good performance, which was to be expected, but what I didn't expect was how great the performances of the actors portraying the teenagers would be. It's funny, because I heard in the commentary that some of them had never even acted before, yet there is no way you could tell that. They all did very well in their roles. Above everything else, Freedom Writers was very inspirational to me. As someone who didn't necessarily do so well in school myself, this film made me realize in the end that I wish I had and it inspired me to just be a better person. It was pretty powerful stuff and that, combined with the acting, the story and the well done soundtrack made this film worth watching.

I've seen it a few times for class type things usually just because the end of the year is coming up i suggest watching it in one sitting for full emotional thrill having it stretched out over a weekend just ruins the appeal it could truly capture with it's heart worming ideas and acting.

The storyline was very interesting, serious and that type that pulls you in. The acting was very well done. There were characters that you loved and despised. (Margaret akhem) But the looks of the students threw me off. They definitely didn't look like 14/15 and 15/16 years old. The cinematography was very nice done too. I loved the idea of the possibilty to change someone if you make something more approachable and put in more effort. The subjects that were touched actively genocide, and troubled youth and how cool it blended all together. Which makes the script good too because everything made sense and was very well planned.

Hillary Swank portrays the young teacher who becomes their English teacher for the Freshman & Sophomore years of High School. I found the settings realistic, and the film did a good job of mixing the violence the students faced everyday in and out of the classroom. The young actors portraying the students look like students more than they look like actors, adding to the realism of the story. As the story progresses, the students and their teacher form a relationship of trust and respect. The story has violence and adult language, but in amounts appropriate to tell the story.

It is about a young first-time teacher called Erin Gruwell (Hilary Swank) who wants to teach at Wilson High School in Long Beach, California. Since her father participated at the Civil Right's Movement her aim is to make a change. As Wilson High takes part in the voluntary integration programme Erin considers best to work there.Except for one student everyone in this class has different origins. The teenagers stay together in their ethnic groups, during the lessons and on the school yard, supposing that ""it's all 'bout colour"". They do not listen to teachers at all. They fight almost every day. To them white people are bad people as they do not respect others but want to be respected. As soon as Erin finds out what their problem is she starts several projects with them such as ""the line game"" or writing diaries. The more attention she pays to them, the closer the relationship between her and the students becomes. ""Miss G."" even buys brand new books for them. The headmistress of English is not satisfied at all. In her opinion ""these kids"" do not deserve any attention at all. But her pupils know that if she has plans ""there's nothing to stop her, man"". Her class cannot imagine a life without their ""crazy English teacher"" anymore. As soon as the problems in class seem to be solved and everyone seems satisfied more and more new problems appear all of a sudden which are not that easy to sort out... Will Erin really manage to find a solution this time and reach her aim?Although sometimes a bit too much of Hollywood-kitsch ""Freedom Writers"" is a very touching and sad story. Due to the fact that it is based on a true story the whole situation is displayed in a very realistic way. In my opinion the set of actors was the best choice. Everyone was ideal for his or her role and embodied the characters very powerfully. It is definitely different from other Hollywood films as there is no exaggeration, no love story, no action in it. It is all real, it has all happened! So to people who do not want to watch mainstream movies anymore I would recommend ""Freedom Writers"".

156,smasherwajahat,Epic movie,8,26 February 2019,"Richard LaGravenese's film, based on the book by Erin Gruwell herself, is a moving example of how one person can make a difference, and for all the right reasons, all contained within the inspirational classroom drama genre. Hilary Swank is terrific as Gruwell, whose marriage broke up partly as a result of her endless hours spent with the kids, even after hours. She starts as a naïve newcomer whose ideals are her strength; but they are not merely ideals to talk about, but to act on. She ruffles the feathers of her colleagues, confronts her class with their ignorance and is herself confronted by their violent, depressing reality. Their grungy appearance contrasts with Erin's classy clothes and pearls, yet her prospects of success here seem as dim theirs.The encounter changes them all, and the film is the story of how that change occurs, what pain it brings and what it achieves. The real story is even bigger, longer and complex, but the film does it justice, even thoug it is flawed; there isn't much sense of the time span, other than a caption to indicate a new semester, and some of the early scenes are unclear. Perhaps inevitably due to compression, the resolution seems a bit too pat. But the performances are superb, notably all the kids in the class, whose lives appear hopelessly pre-determined, destined for waste.
However, its a dissapointment to include seducement and nudity in educational kind of movies.since parents like to watch thos type of movies with their kids.The film tugs at our hearts with its sincerity while the uplifting moments are hard earned by a difficult journey.

I mean yeah you have Hilary Swank who has already established herself with Million Dollar Baby, but this new girl April Hernandez was phenomenal. I think she made the movie. All the struggles she was faced with throughout the entire movie and the way the handled everything was inspiring. I mean I could literally feel her pain as she dealt with the struggle of whether or not to trust this new teacher of hers(Swank) or to go with her family and only look out for her own kind. The racial issues addressed in this film are very controversial, but also so important to get into the mainstream so that our society can finally realize what is going on in our country.
Hilary Swank was fantastic, all the children in the classroom were very captivating; I grew emotionally attached to each one of them. The purpose and subject matter of this film was very engrossing to me -- racial injustice, especially when it comes to youth that don't get fair opportunities. The story line quickly drew me in, as it was very emotionally gripping - so much so that I teared up a bit on more than one occasion.
however the premise is extremely offensive and very adult language and seductive scene have been recorded which makes it not suitable or legitimate for the parent to watch it along with their kids.",Freedom Writers

159,cthompson_69,One of the Best Films I have Seen in a Long Time,9,5 March 2007,"Going into the cinema I had high expectations for this movie and I was praying not to be disappointed, believe me I was far far from being disappointed.The film failed to captivate me in the first 10minutes, but after that it flows really well and draws you into the remarkable story that at times you cant believe is true.Unlike Dangerous Minds this movie is less violent and far more lighter to watch. The movie goes at a really nice pace and allows you to get to know the students and their backgrounds reasonably well. The heartfelt moment between the students and the elderly lady whom help hide Ann Frank, was simply one of the most touching and moving piece of film I have seen. At times I felt the movie was trying to hard to impress but you allow that because they superb acting throughout makes it worth while. The actress who plays the character Ava was outstanding and stands out amongst a worthy supporting cast, who each deliver a heartfelt and real performance.Hilary Swanks portrayal was perfectly understated and on point. She delivered perfectly they right amount of power and sadness to her character, however at times I did feel that her portrayal was becoming very predictable, but that said her overall performance for me was at a higher standard to the Dangerous Minds lead Michelle Pfhifer.This movie will overall pull on every emotion you have. You cant help however, the fact that at times you feel as though you've'e seen it all before, like the time she takes her students to the restaurant which is similar to Dangerous Minds. However the movie goes deeper and pulls out moments that will leave you reaching for the nearest tissue-box.A CAPTAVATING STORY THAT WILL LEAVE YOU Overwhelmed WITH EMOTION FROM Beginning TO END.",Freedom Writers

In the beginning she is not accepted by her (mostly colored) students, but gradually she learns how she can win the respect of the students and she manages to inspire them to do schoolwork and get good grades.So Freedom Writers like i said has good intentions but its just poorly written. From the first 5 minutes of the movie you already know exactly how this is going to end. When i watched the trailer i thougt this movie was going to be good turned out it was just another cliché movie.There are a lot of bad things in this movie like the runtime! The runtime is 123 minutes! Normally thats a O.K runtime but when you know exactly what is going to happen its very boring to watch something for 2 hours!Ofcourse this movie also has some good things in it like the part were Miep Gies came en told the whole class about her story of world war two that was a good and powerfull moment in the movie. Because you can fully see how much the students There is this scene with the students telling miss gruwel that they dont own her their respect is actually the best part of the whole movie. And thats basically all the good in the movie.But anyway the beginning is very slowly the whole beginning is spread out in 1 hour en then the ending is only ten minutes. Why? There are also 45 useless minutes like the whole relationship troubles with her husband dont add anything to the movie. Its really dissepointing cause i thought this movie could be good turns out its just another cliche.To sum up everything i would say that this movie has good intentions but its just poorly written. I think there are lots of other movies with the same intentions but just a lot better like the hate u give. I dont reccoment watching this movie",Freedom Writers

Erin Gruwell sees that she is not interesting and that no one needs her lessons at all. The teacher sees that the children are full of their own problems related to crime and drugs. The only way she accepts is by keeping diaries, so that the children can feel love for her and begin to struggle with their problems. Due to the full dedication of herself to work, she divorces her husband, and this situation leaves a deep mark in her memory, but she does not stop working with children. and achieves colossal successes, her students are completely changing their lives, and they are heading for a great future.",Freedom Writers

I mean the story line is only semi-original and aside from that MTV made it which kinda made me shrug my nose a bit. All in all though i was pleasantly surprised. The movie really does grip the audience. The acting is excellent, Swank was really breath taking and solidified herself as a multi-role actress, not just the million dollar baby. Even the kids in the movie acted extremely well. And the story is much deeper and thought out than I had thought it would be. They show you several different angles from different students that really connects the audience with their personal struggles. Great cinematography, the camera angles were interesting and effective, but nothing too revolutionary. The thing that really drives the movie though are the diverse plot lines. It is not just the struggle of a teacher and students it stretches far beyond. Left me with a similar feeling as American History X.

I think the movie is unbelievable moving because it is a movie based on a real story and the film shows the different perspectives of the different students and their personal attitudes and their race influenced view of life very good.

170,stanford-9,"Nothing new here thematically, but it would be grossly unfair to call Freedom Writers worthless.",6,18 February 2007,"Freedom Writers tries to be the literary version of Stand and Deliver, but don't dismiss it just because it doesn't match the emotion or capture the inner-city life as poignantly as the 1988 Oscar nominated film. Though it lacks the singular student presence that Lou Diamond Phillips brought to Jaime Escalante's calculus class, Writers still delivers, on the shoulders of two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank.Inspired by real events, Writers depicts a mid-90s Long Beach, CA (yes, Snoop's turf) tarnished by the violence of the Rodney King riots. Enter Erin Gruwell (Swank), a bright-eyed, Starbucks-sipping first time teacher from the 'burbs (at one point she tells a student to 'stop tribbin'), prepared to hand out copies of Homer's The Odyssey to her students, most of whom hover around a fifth grade reading level. Like the other teacher- inspires-students flicks, 'Miss G' comes to the realization that earning the respect of her students requires more than a passing on of comma usage rules, and through the adaptation of her methods to match her streetwise freshmen, room 203 slowly but surely becomes a safe haven from the outside maelstrom of gang violence, dilapidated neighborhoods, and disenchanted faculty members.Swank pulls off the teacher look by trading in her Million Dollar Baby boxing gloves for chalk and conservative skirts, and she's able to channel the raw energy she brought with a right hook into the more refined (but only slightly) classroom.Hindering Swank's performance is an average screenplay more insistent on verbally force-feeding the urban plight than visually developing it, rendering the incessant 'you don't know what it's like out there' rants clichéd.",Freedom Writers

Freedom Writers is not, at least in my opinion, disrespectful to kids and their families living in these places. It is a little bit oversimplified and ""romanticized"", but this is obviously to adapt it for the big screen from the book and the real story. The views expressed were in no way patronizing as this type of stories so often are. The acting and script is a little bit weird or disconnected, but overall it is well done.But how can anybody watch a film like this and not compare it to the great ""Stand and Deliver""? It's a shame that Stand and Deliver is not as popularly recognized as it deserves.

I fail to sympathize too much with their plight. Perhaps if they were Somalian villagers I would feel more empathy, but the truth is this country has many free learning resources and minority scholarships, and if they tried to make something of their life they could. Yes, I realize it was a true story, but I just don't like the way they presented it. As if living in the inner city is soo tough and we are required to sympathize. I find myself rolling my eyes at statements like ""we fight for territory"" To be honest, the person I sympathized most with was the failure husband, pushed to the side by his wife, and too old to realistically pursue his dreams. maybe I'm being a bit harsh here. I have never been shot at walking down the street. but as a child I was very poor; we had no furniture, no heat, no plumbing, no electricity, and literally no money.

I can start my route in Cambodia Town and 15 mins later find myself at the mailboxes of mini mansions of Naples and Belmont Shore.I've seen kids attacking each other along my beat on their way home from school. I've seen the helicopters hover and the cops close streets due to homicide at 10:30am. I've been in the midst of a clobbering myself when a ""White Power"" couple started in on my colorful group of friends at a club inside a bowling alley (RIP).Long Beach is the most diverse city in the nation and, where you have differences you HAVE FEAR. (I am willing to bet that cars that have tinted windows get shot at more than those without tint due to ""fear of the unknown""). It's a place where you're gunned down because of the music you listen to, the bike you ride, the language you speak, the clothes you wear. (Of course the city has lovely safe areas near the beach and tourist spots ;) The FREEDOM WRITERS movie characters all have names, but in the book ""Freedom Writers Diary"", the writers are anonymous. They are labeled by their journal entry numbers which have been creatively woven together, seamlessly connecting their own personal sorrows, challenges, and chaotic homelives. (Eva reminds me of Roma, a LB Mom who lost her son Paul in a drive-by when he was looking to buy a car with his earnings!) The teacher, Ms. Gruwell is married to someone who first appears to somewhat support her effort but he is definitely not ON her team. (He reminds me of my own exhusband who told me I couldn't change the world). As Ms. G realizes her student's priorities are SURVIVAL not studying, she creatively personalizes music, books, movies, and experiences from kids around the world who share their plight. Her classroom becomes a safe haven, a second (and preferred) home to her students, some who were evicted and homeless. These ""loser"" kids who weren't expected to stay in class begin to have a yearning for learning envied by the school's ""smarter"" kids.The Diary of ANNE FRANK inspires meetings with Holocaust survivors as well as ZLATA FILIPOVIC from Sarajevo, a young girl the same age as Gruwell's students who writes the books Foreword (a masterpiece in itself I might add!) To quote Zlata, ""The Freedom Writers chose to break this cycle "" ... of anger, hatred, fear ... "" and make their positive (learning) experiences a lesson for generations to come."" Gruwell didn't just change the lives of 150 students she empowered, she affected Long Beach's future crime rate AND is currently empowering teachers everywhere! (See GruwellProject dot org)I'd love to see ERIN GRUWELL meet with Long Beach Chief of Police ANTHONY BATTS and THOMAS SWIERINGA (a Long Beach Local who has a Black Belt in Six Sigma) so they can apply ""Freedom"" to the general public. Gruwell's contagious attitude and quest for tolerance belongs not only in the classroom but outside of it! (Note: The school system doesn't seem to be promoting this movie, a friend who works for LB Unified School District thought it was a movie about a Los Angeles HS and a CSULB English Professor I met just today was CLUESS about it! Maybe she can get ""Your Greatest Power"" by J.Martin Kohe in every classroom (hospital, jail, etc.), implement retired teachers to ""man"" our libraries and retired police and military to secure our schools. There are many journal entries not depicted in the film (yet? Maybe there will be a sequel :). Pregnancy, A.D.D., obesity, homosexuality...

What I came away with was a greater appreciation for how real our cultural differences still are, while at the same time, how much they have the capacity to bring us closer together. This movie comes at a poignant time when our country is so divided by religious and political differences. Hilary Swank rises to a new level of talent in this role - perfectly personifying the naive white middle-class teacher with such good intentions, who is so totally out of touch with the lives of her racially-divided students. And since the characters are real and the story is true, it is hard to discount what this movie proves - that we each have a tremendous opportunity, as ordinary people - regardless of race - to come together and make positive change.

Shame on all the bloody bastards who wasted money to make this awful propaganda film.The premise is extremely offensive, and any attempt to make the movie original make it even more distasteful. White teacher turns wayward minority kids, who obviously cant do anything in their communities, and it is her ""White Man's Burden"", to civilize these woeful street urchins. But of course, I mean, what if they actually have to become respectable people without the aid of the cliché ""trying to make a change"" teacher.It completely spits into the face of real-life urban life, and the fact that crime, vandalism, all these things are a part, but not dominant forces in urban life. It IS Possible for someone who is a minority, and grew up in a urban area to NOT need the help of the ""oh-so successful bourgeios"". THis film is a disgrace, an utter disgrace and affront to working class poor, and the general oppressed urban minority in the United States.This is the incarnation of the guilt of the Whites for having marginalized these groups of people, and classifying them, forever in time immemorial, as urban street thugs who care about nothing more than vices. Please for the love of all thats good, do not be fooled by the ""movie by numbers"", ""urban kids are inferior, and oh so retarded without the help of the bourgeois"", and laughable attempt at creating a change.This is one of a long list of failures in the formulaic, and I think intentional destruction of the last shred of dignity the working class in America has.

191,DmitryNickWilliams,Overcoming your fears,8,25 February 2021,"Freedom Writers is a film which based on the self-titled novel by Erin Gruwell and her students who made the book out of their own diaries. Erin Gruwell let the students write anything about their lives and fears in diary. All in all they get together despite the fears they face every day.This drama film raises a bunch of problems that are very familiar to many people. These are problems of crime and punishment, of a friendship, getting along with people and overcoming your fears. All people around the world have a thought that they're not quite good enough in something or that they're different.That's right. We are all different. And we should be thankful for that. We have to grow on ourselves and go forward no matter what. This is what I took from that film personally.I also should mention the cast. I really liked the main actress Hilary Swank and actors who played students. I couldn't find any information about them unfortunately but anyway I liked their playing. In addition, music was also cool. I'm more of a rock-guy but music was catchy, to be honest.So, I liked this film in general. I experienced a lot of emotional moments while watching it. Such stories should be told on screen so that many people knew it. We must be more kindful and attentive to those who may silently suffer. And if we do so, the world will be a better place to live.

Journals are a tool which gets our feelings out of our head and into the world of people that are living in today's society. It reminded me of the trouble that had happened in southern Calfornia during the time of the 1990's. It was a good idea for the teacher of the class to get additional money for the books that she gives out for the students to read for the class herself because the high school district won't be able to get the books for her class for her.

The movie raises certain themes like murder, drugs, gangs, racism and a long etcetera, and tries to persuade us that the education is the solution to those problems, especially historical education.I think that this interpretation demerits and covers up other more important factors than the film itself states but which it soon forgets, such as the economic context of the characters, or even the power that other individuals exercise over the life of the protagonists, these just to mention a few.In conclusion, the film is everything that can be expected of its genre (without spectacular shots, even without a masterful edition), however they are things that could be forgiven, but the message is too simplistic and worse, it gives an incomplete idea of how is to live and get out of a gang.",Freedom Writers

The film is based on real events and tells about the difficult everyday life of an English teacher. She managed to make good guys out of students who are more accustomed to holding a pistol in their hands, not a pen.
The main character Erin Gruwell (Hilary Swank) is a young teacher with no experience. The film begins with a price tag when she takes a job at a school in Long Beach, California. Where she takes the lead over students from disadvantaged areas.
For those who love films based on real events as much as I should like this film, the acting and musical accompaniment are at their best! I also really liked the idea of how a young teacher with no work experience was able to rally SUCH a class, it's just incredible! her methods and work style are worth watching this film Summing up, I can say that the film ""Writers of Freedom"" is the film that will make you think for a long time!",Freedom Writers

I mean, once there has been a satire, why do another one? Because it is worth it. Freedom writers does not focus on Hilary Swanks's bleeding heart and how she swoops into save each of these kids from their lives. The focus is on the students and their individual stories, as told when Mrs. G requires them to start keeping a diary. Like a real teacher that is horrified by the violence in her classroom, she uses techniques and exercises(step to the line/the gender exercise/journaling) to understand for herself and to illustrate to the students the root of their issues and how the ""wars"" they fight everyday are a cycle that they can break away from. Mrs. G. sacrifices her time and personal life to expose her students to culture and give them learning materials that the school board doesn't believe her students are worthy of. There is no ""Dangerous Minds"" style jumping into the fight, arguing with parents or inappropriate attachment or singling out of a favorite student. She is just teaching her students, gives them time and space to learn and be safe and digs into her own resources, only after she sees that they are not available through the proper channels.

But, watching this show brought back many memories about education in America. Programmed packaged type teaching is the preferred method for many school systems. How we learn in a fragmented high school system is always a current issue in the news. The method of teaching the lesson is not always the choice of the teacher. Teachers work for a school system and are told what and how to teach. Most of the time there is not much freedom for teachers in a high school setting. It can be a very long and sad and boring and lonely day in a classroom without gradual student transforms. The establishment does want results from the students and teachers. But, a featured movie can show that one teacher, alone can make a difference to some people. So, there maybe something wrong with the educational system and not that English teacher.

The director wasn't afraid to show a glimpse of what life was like for these kids (and death.) Of course they may edit some things out to get a PG13 rating (I hope they don't.) Hilary Swank does some of her best acting , as usual, but most of the other cast are great as well. It's good that they are unknowns, because it makes you feel like they are real and not just acting. When I went to see this, I thought of Dangerous Minds, The Principal, Lean on Me, and Stand and Deliver. I think this is a little better than all of those, though those are good movies (Dangerous Minds was a little weak, though.) This movie takes place between 1994 and 1996 in Long Beach, CA, so you have to keep that in mind. The music does a good job of placing the time period, and all the songs are classics. This movie probably won't do well at the box office, but good movies never do so what can you do? Oh well.

233,andrewbrobinson,just awful and inaccurate,1,24 December 2011,"So many reviews here I just want to add a few points. First, allow me to qualify, I am a LB Wilson graduate and attended K-12 in the LBUSD. LBUSD was integrated a very, very long time before this teacher taught for a few years. That aside, it is racist to assert that integration had anything to do with the problems at LB Wilson. It was my experience that integration enriched my experience. The problems asserted in this film were fictional. LB Wilson is ofter referred to as the ""gem of the district."" It is a great and beautiful HS in the Belmont Heights neighborhood (which is adjacent to Belmont Shore). So this ghetto theme they were passing off is a lie.Rudy was a fun movie - I've seen it many times. But it was filled with lies. But it is fun so I can live with the Rudy Ruettiger exaggerations. In other words, I can overlook serious gaps in truth or logic if they're replaced with great writing, scenery and acting. Freedom Writers failed in every regard. That is, Freedom Writers delivered the lies and nothing else. It is my suspicion that a publicist was hard at work spinning this story.I watched only 30 minutes before pulling the disk - I couldn't stand anymore. Speaking of standing, if you want to watch an inspirational movie about public school teaching in under-served areas of Los Angeles, watch Stand and Deliver. Jaime Escalante's multi-decade teaching career offers substantially more credibility over a teacher that lasted a couple or few years.",Freedom Writers

Hilary Swank plays the role of Erin Gruwell very heart-warming and moving, also very affecting, April Lee Hernandez in her role as young Hispanic student Eva.

""Freedom Writers"", which is based on a true story, is about a young and enthusiastic woman, named Erin Gruwell, who becomes a first-time teacher at Wilson High School. In the daily lives many of the students at Wilson High live they are often confronted with gang wars and violence. For the students it is all about respect and fighting for their own blood. Besides Erin's story also the stories of some other students are shown in the film and make the viewer realize how hard it can be to not know what the right thing to do is. As being shown in the film the kids realize that ""everybody in their own small way can turn a little light on, in a small room"". In my opinion ""Freedom Writers"" is a really good film not only for watching at school. This story has a lot of emotion in it and it makes the viewer think.

236,dfb_rules,arschloch,10,26 May 2011,"Freedom writers is a 2007 drama film produced by Richard LaGravenese. The whole story takes place at Long Beach, California, where Erin Gruwell, a young inexperienced teacher starts her first day at Woodrow Wilson High School, willing to change something. Her enthusiasm is rapidly challenged when she realizes that her students are all gang members, paying no respect to each other and to her. They are also known as the 'unteachables' on Woodrow Wilson High School. In class, fights break out, students ditch their classes and the classroom is divided into racial groups. This is what Erin wants to prevent, but in the beginning she has no chance, but she builds up a special relation to them by listening to them, giving them new books and hence giving them a value. One night, Eva, a Hispanic girl, visits a grocery store with her gang. There they find the Korean gang with Sindy and her boyfriend, and Grant, a black gang member threatening the shop owner, wanting his money back. Paco, Eva's boyfriend, had a conflict with Grant at school and points the gun at him with no further ado when he exits the shop. Grant can escape and Paco accidentally kills Sindys boyfriend. No one saw what really happened, except for Eva. Will she tell the police the truth or will she blame Grant and hence rescue her boyfriend from going to prison and showing loyalty to her gang? So all in all I enjoyed this movie very much. Already from the beginning certain suspense is being built up, because an inexperienced teacher directly tries to teach the 'unteachables', succeeding in the end. I found it great that the whole story really happened once and that the students were able to meet Miep Gies, even though they were seen as 'unsocial' and difficult. But there is also something to complain about. I believe that the students looked far older than they actually had to be, and that was between 14 and 15 years old. Last but not least I would strongly recommend this movie because it shows that also the 'bad' kids deserve a second chance and if they have got someone to trust and who supports them, they will accept this opportunity.",Freedom Writers

At first she really did not know how hard it is to teach uncontrolled students like they were and faced the reality of a reform school like Wilson High was. Before I watched the film I thought it is a general film like every teacher would watch with us in the elevens grade.

239,draganstrmica,Superb,10,1 December 2011,"When one hears the title Freedom Writers he cannot help but to think of some big names from human history that inspired whole generations either by their work or their actions. The same applies to this movie. It begins like all other movies from the Hollywood movie factory about coming of age, with high-school kids and their problems. Of course, for dramatic reasons there is also a first-time-teaching in school-teacher (portrayed here by Hilary Swank), with enough zeal to teach the whole district. The next thing one can expect is a pregnant teenage girl, or drug abuse, or something else along those lines. That is where one will be wrong. The Freedom Writers is a movie about change. It is a serious look at the present state of education in the country and at the same time, how little is needed to achieve the excellence. A teacher that is not giving up, and who believes that behind the facade of sleepy and bored students lays a well of flammable fuel of thirst for knowledge, can bring the much needed spark to ignite it. It shows how endurance and diligence of one can inflame and change many. It shows that if a system is in place that that does not mean that it is perfect and unchangeable, that it cannot be improved. It does not mean that one needs to go with the flow and give up on trying changing things.

It gives insight in to how our inner city schools are being run .The enjoyment of watching one teacher fight against the system sent chills through my spine. No matter how hard things got she never gave up, she also gave a 100% of herself every single day. I would definitely recommend this movie for others to see. Hilary Swank, who is the star of this movie, also starred in such movies as Million Dollar Baby, Amelia Earhart and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, gives an Oscar award winning performance. She captivates the audience with her witty sense of humor and her heartwarming charm. We are taken on a trip from the inner city projects to the suburban life of outer city schools that have been designated to handle some of the inner city kids. Many of the teachers at the suburban schools have given up on the kids because they feel that they are a lost cause. Swank comes in, and shows the kids that there is more to life then hating and killing one another. Furthermore, she shows them a whole new world by exposing them to new things such as museums, hotels, and other cultures that had it much worse than they did. She eventually united the kids, and they began to move as one cohesive unit. Many of us have kids and should want the very best for them in life. Teaching our kids hate and segregation should never be the solution. In conclusion, I give this movie four and a half stars. I would highly recommend this movie to a friend. You never know how it may change their outlook on some of the things that go on in their life.

241,pascal-kabasele,Movie review,9,1 December 2011,"The path to change requires an unpopular perspective. The movie titled ""The freedom writers"" is about an English teacher named Erin Gruwell. It's 1994 when Erin started her first job as a freshman and sophomore English teacher at Woodrow Wilson High School, which, two years earlier, implemented a voluntary integration program. Despite choosing the school on purpose because of its integration program, Erin is unprepared for the nature of her classroom, whose students live by generations of strict moral codes of protecting their own at all costs. Surprised by the school violence in her classroom at Woodrow Wilson High school, Erin chose an uncommon learning process by imposing a diary to each student in which they should write their story, from their background to daily life. This approach had enhanced her teaching method at the point that her students had been transformed in a kind of classroom-family.While her concern has been getting better, the school board started fighting her for the reason that the school had its own mission, especially not being preoccupied by students' life after class, or living close to students like in a family. After organizing different activities, such as a trip on weekends with her classroom, Erin Gruwell had been recognized as one of the best teachers ever seen just in her first two years of teaching, and was able to transform a violent classroom into a family -classroom. For many of the existing teachers, the integration has ruined the school, and Erin's classroom was lucky to have students who had been almost the first in their families to graduate from high school and go to college.",Freedom Writers

The relationship developed between the teacher, Erin Gruwill portrayed by actress Hilary Swank, and each and every one of her students was phenomenal and truly motivating. Miss Gruwill was literally blessed with a bunch of kids that needed her, specifically, as their teacher. Equally, the students were blessed to have Miss Gruwill. The students in room 203 at Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach, California were deemed as ""unteachable, at-risk teenagers"" until Miss Gruwill came into the picture and completely changed both her own and the lives of her students forever. Instead of just giving up on the troubled children and putting a mediocre effort in teaching them, Miss Gruwill took the time to understand their situations and what they were up against in the environment they reside in. Because she took the time to genuinely show an interest in her students' lives and their education, Miss Gruwill's teaching tactics began to be passionately disliked by her fellow coworkers. This brought about many challenges in her work and personal life.In the end, even though the students in room 203 collectively faced countless of challenging issues, both the students and Miss Gruwill proved many people, including themselves, wrong.

These students separated themselves just because of ethnicity in the streets and even in classroom and they made groups of Hispanics, Blacks, Asians, and Whites.I was shocked when I saw their conditions. They only killed and gone to jail just because of they belong to a different races. For example, many were participants of different gangs, and they were killing and killed for the color of their skin. Most of them had been shot at, and almost all had lost their friends because of one friend were involved in gang violence. Some were involved in a gang and involved in the violence because of poverty.

The way the character development was shown, and how there were individual scenes outside of the classroom scenes that allow the viewer to understand the lives of the children better. I'm really happy that I got to watch it, inspired me to change myself and how I do things. I think what really caught my attention is the difference between Mrs. Gruwell and the other teachers. I strongly believe that what allowed her to succeed with inspiring those children to change is the fact that she was so fresh, and her mind had not yet been thrashed with all of these dark ideas of the world. Some might call her naive, but that naive factor in her nature is what, in my opinion, got her to succeed. She refused to believe that such children could not be brought to see the world in a different way. That was very inspirational, reminded me that my views should not be tainted by what other people say. Also, the way the students were portrayed was beautiful. The director managed to show how all of them believed in what she was saying, but some were scared to stand alone, some were too disappointed by life, and some just did not believe that she would be able to do something different than other teachers, and grown ups in general, in the students' lives.",Freedom Writers

Woodrow Wilson High School, which just two years before, had created an integration program, was suffering from the concept of kids simply getting left behind because of their economic status and their race. Gruwell would be joining a staff of teachers that had already given up on these students before they had even walked into the classroom. Coming from a wealthy upbringing, Gruwell enters her new job as somewhat naive about the lives these troubled teens were living outside of school. In a classroom exercise, she quickly learns that many of her misunderstood students have had someone in their lives killed from gang violence. Gruwell's classroom is immediately divided by racial tension amongst the students. After initiating an open discussion about a recent shooting, Gruwell begins to understand the circumstances that her students are up against. She also quickly learns that these students have so much to say. With this, she assigns a writing project where each of her students is given a journal to freely write about anything that they want. As the year goes on the students begin to turn to Mrs. Gruwell about their problems as their bond with one another strengthens. Throughout the school year, the students' education requires more and more. Being that the school isn't particularly concerned with these specific students, Gruwell can't get the funding, for things like computers, so she takes it upon herself to provide for these less fortunate students. In doing so, she attains part time jobs in order to afford these things. By the end of the year, Gruwell has developed an extremely strong bond with her students and becomes an outlet for each and every one of them. Although this story of discrimination and denial of education is one that is told often, Freedom Writers is one movie that audiences will never get tired of. Movies dealing with race, such as Coach Carter or Remember the Titans, are able to get through to the audience because of the personal relationships on screen that you almost begin to feel like you are a part of. With each individual student's story, we begin to see more and more into the life of an underprivileged and overlooked teen of an urban high school. These students were wrongfully denied an education because not much was expected of them just because of the color of their skin. This storyline is one that occurs way too often in what is now a society that should be well past racial and socio economic discrimination. Americans need to continue to be reminded of the on going level of prejudice that still exists and Freedom Writers is able to do just that. By the end of this movie, viewers are given a definitive sense of hope. A sense that fighting for something, even if there's nothing in it for you, is still worth it. Mrs. Gruwell is able to single handedly change each of her student's lives in a dramatic way just by simply giving them a chance that others wouldn't. Gruwell believed that these kids all deserved an opportunity at an education and at a better life. Along with teaching her students about poetry and literature, Mrs. Gruwell was also able to teach these kids to fight for what they believed in and for what they deserved.Freedom Writers is able to distinctly show the power of an education to young viewers. In a time where education is taken for granted by privileged children, this movie is able to blatantly show that not everyone is easily given an education. These students, with the help of Mrs. Gruwell, had to fight for what they so rightfully deserved a shot at. It's bad enough that kids, like these in Freedom Writers, have to worry about where their next meal will be coming from, they should at least not have to worry about where their education is going to come from.The affect that this movie can have on one can be quite powerful. These affects will definitely be different depending on who is watching in the audience. As an underprivileged youth, this movie could give one a sense of hope that their life can improve, especially when the power of education is involved. It could show them that their future isn't defined by the color of their skin or any other characteristics for that matter. On the other hand, Freedom Writers could have a very different affect on someone who is more privileged. For someone who is able to easily attain an education, this movie would show him or her that not everyone is as lucky as they are. That education isn't something that is just handed out. Some people have to actually fight for it. It would teach them to be grateful for what they have and more aware of the society that we live in. It would also show someone the influence that they could have upon someone else's life simply by believing in him or her.Overall, Freedom Writers is a realistic movie that members of all different backgrounds could learn valuable and important lessons from. Along with the lessons, is the fact that this is simply an emotionally enjoyable movie for audiences of different ages.",Freedom Writers
255,vtdavidr,Understood and Redelivered,7,7 January 2007,"Inspirational, but it seems like I've seen this all before. Between ""To Sir, With Love"" and ""Stand and Deliver"", we see the same formula once again- overlooked and socially disadvantaged students who are led from someone from the outside. The department chair in this one was almost identical to the one in ""Stand and Deliver"". Teacher takes class on a field trip- same in both the earlier films. It was a good film that just was not original, and quite frankly, myself being a teacher of lower level students who strives to inspire, I think it had good intentions but fell a bit short of the other two films. I am always mystified in these films how they never show the other four-fifths of the classes that the teacher has, as if they spend the entire day with this one class. Even when they have a speaker, only the one class attends.",Freedom Writers
256,allie_ansted,Worth the Money!,10,6 January 2007,"Ironically, I hadn't heard anything about this movie until after I'd read the book, which was given to me 2 weeks ago and which I was up until well past 1 in the morning reading. If you're in the education field and have a passion for teaching and reaching out to kids, this is the perfect movie for you. A lot of people are calling it another ""Dangerous Minds"" and ""nothing new."" But, how many movies do we see depicting violence, or the teenage girl who needs a date to the prom or the football legend? The point is that these students were able to make something of themselves, and in today's time our kids need to see that it is possible. The movie is a true story about how a teacher walked into class on the first day expecting to go down one path and walking out at the end of four years on a completely different path... with ALL of her students. It's so easy to label people, especially teenagers today. And, often it is the labeling that does the most damaging because it creates an expectation that is so hard to break. This movie shows what happens when a teacher changes that expectation and replaces it with one of success.",Freedom Writers
257,haleycarlock-04042,I absolutely loved this movie.,10,8 December 2015,"We were reviewing poetry in my Honors English Class, and after that unit was over, my teacher allowed us to watch a movie of her choice. When I heard the name, ""Freedom Writers"", I was a bit skeptical; I thought it was going to be a boring movie about books. But after I watched it, my entire viewpoint on this (absolutely astonishing) movie was changed. I LOVED this movie. (I even cried at some portions). Erin was not going to back down from what was right. She changed these kids, and changed their lives. This movie made me look at things with a different perspective. I will definitely recommend this movie (plus the book) to everyone I know. People NEED to watch this movie. It's so amazing, and they'd love it.",Freedom Writers
258,ameliaortega05,Surprisingly very impressive.,10,6 January 2007,"When I had first seen the trailer for this movie on TV, the first thought that came to me was that it would be some rip-off of ""Dangerous Minds"" but boy was I wrong. This movie was brilliant in so many ways. The script was well-written and the actors within the film had delivered a beautiful performance. I loved how Hilary Swank's character had even used great works of literature that did in some way strongly connect to the lives of her students. Not only were the story lines implemented within the film very powerful and heart-touching, but they were believable and not so over the top. The humor was really smart too which was a big plus. One minute I would be on the verge of crying and the next I would be laughing my butt off. It is a bit similar to ""Dangerous minds"", however, the story that it depicts is original in its own rite. I would definitely give this movie 10 out of 10.",Freedom Writers
259,mowa2222,best film of 2007,10,20 February 2008,"Freedom writers with a cast led by 2 time academy award winner Hilary Swank is a memorising, tear-provoking, inspirational journey of room 203 at a long beach high school where a class of deemed ""un-teachable"" teenagers wanting more out of life, led by their teacher just might make their dream of a better life come true.The story starts as a pretty typical ""urban movie"" with guns, beatings and general misbehaviour while introducing the character ""Eva"" to us who we soon learn has lost her father to jail after a misunderstanding led him to be arrested, we then move to the classroom where it tricks you into thinking it will be just another film about a school where a teacher makes a difference and seeming to take its story from ""dangerous minds"" your guide is let down as if your mind knows what's coming. As she struggles to maintain the attention of the class a note is been passed around to which is revealed to contain a racist picture of the black student, this is where the story goes in a whole new direction as Erin begins to tell the class about the holocaust and outlines the students legacy will only be their negativity, from here the class start to read the book of Anne Frank and begin to relate to her situation and are soon raising money to bring Miep Gies (the woman who housed Anne Frank) to the United States to meet them. I found the story to be very heart-felt, deeply grounded and kept true to everyday life unlike numerous movies in the same genre which is helped from been a true story.The acting is exceptional with stand out performances, Hilary Swank is as always sensational as the lead character Erin Gruwell with lots of depth and heart to her as she sacrifices her own marriage to provide for the kids including getting 2 extra jobs to provide books and trips for the ""family"" as they referred to themselves. Eva is a troubled and confused girl with a hard home life fuelled by her families views she ""hates white people on sight"" I feel her character grows the most throughout the movie as she ends as a proud woman standing for what is right rather then right for her family. Andre played by Musician Mario is 1 of the surprises as he puts in a good all round performance from comedy moments to emotional scenes, struggling with drug dealing been pressured onto him he puts trust in Erin and his new found family to bring him his own redemption. These are just the main performances that catch my eye every actor and actress who graces the screen is at a very high standard.As this is a drama there are no real big visual effects to speak of beside 1 scene in particular when each member of the class is reading parts from their diary and you get a mix/fade effect of the character as they speak their part flashing in and out of the classroom, other such effects as camera movements used by director's such as Michael bay with the camera rotating around Erin as she reads the diaries are used to create ambiance and to get you to focus on her, it doesn't look fake and is done very well, despite been made by MTV nothing music video style here. The effects are perfectly chosen and used necessarily to bring the words to life.Overall I found the film breathtakingly emotional and powerful with a very positive message, ""try hard and you will succeed in life"" you finish the movie feeling lucky for your own circumstances and for the things around you others do not have. The music I must also add gives the movie a off screen character of it's own as it sets the mood of the scene and is used perfectly in all occasions as the lyrics in the songs relate to the story it's been streamed over. The truly gripping story Freedom Writers takes from is put on screen in a truly wonderful portrayal without over dramatising or over acting any of the scenes they play out very natural. My only negative comment about the movie is I don't believe for 1 moment any of the class are 14, the actors are all older but the story so moving you don't question it. To sum up this is a fantastic movie and would recommend it to anyone of all ages and gender. This is NOT just another movie about teens in a bad area this is the movie the others wanted to be.",Freedom Writers
260,wonkatania3,Fine By Me,9,5 January 2007,"I walked into the movie theater with the ticket in my hand thinking about how many other movies I have seen like the one I am about to watch. ""Remember the Titans"", ""Stand and Deliver"", ""Dangerous Minds"", and the list goes on and on. And so I sat in my comfy chair that rocks back and forth so my back doesn't get stiff. Of course, my theater has stadium seating so someone's big head doesn't get in the way of my movie experience. And of course, I had to sit in the row with the railing in front of it so I could put my feet up, because I wasn't going to be uncomfortable while I play critic for this movie...what are you, crazy? Then, the movie began. and it ran and I was quiet. I laughed a little and cried a little, but not for one second was I criticizing. As I saw the characters go through their horribly troubled lives and while I was reminded of little Anne Frank, I became somewhat guilty about silently complaining that I got the squeaky seat or that my friend ate all the popcorn five minutes into the movie.Likewise, when the movie was over, I had nothing negative to say. It wasn't that I was biting my tongue, it was that I wasn't paying attention to the mistakes of the movie (wherever they were) because I was so engrossed in the plot...you know, the one I said had been done before. the movie made me realize that gang violence and racial intolerance are just as big issues today as EVER. And I decided that as long as people are isolated because of their race and as long as people innocently die in the midst of a gang war, it's okay for this plot to live on...it gives hope to those who go to bed with one eye open, and who go to school everyday wondering if they'll live to see their own graduation.And for me? For someone like me who complains about hastily eaten popcorn? It makes me count my blessings just a LITTLE bit more frequently. And any movie with a tired, overdone plot that can do that...well, it's fine by me.",Freedom Writers
261,angelgregzion,My favorite movie!,10,4 September 2007,"I finally saw this movie and I can now say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. I know all too well how it felt to grow up in the ghetto and feel oppressed. I was the same age as those kids when it took place. I wish I had a teacher like her back then, but I had to learn the hard and long way. It's great to know that kids today can see this film and get a greater understanding of how education can open the world to people, as it has done for me. I'm so proud of these students and I hope to meet them all in person one day. If God calls me to work with students I would want to take the Freedom Writers course they have available for teachers wanting to use her methods of instruction.",Freedom Writers
262,panhellfsu,Shame on Hollywood,1,5 January 2007,"Shame on Hollywood for creating these types of films. I feel like they are trying to send a message that black students are just not smart and to succeed they need a white teacher to help motivate them.There have be quite a few TV shows and movies from Dangerous Minds to Freedom Writers. Hollywood you are furthering the educational divide by capturing this on film that for black students your future is set unless you have a white teacher other wise you will become a statistic.Most of the society already thinks this of them, then why do you keep furthering that. There is almost like a subliminal message with all of these films and TV shows: They don't care about their education. They are a lost cause. They could care less about their future. They are just not smart so why bother. Whether Hollywood means to push these types of messages it is an underlining message associated with them.",Freedom Writers

I was amazed at how well each of the students experiences and perspectives about life were expressed throughout the movie; how Erin struggled to find ways to connect with her students, and how the students were able to open up and grow from her lessons and each other. You really felt for the characters and what they were going through. I definitely plan on seeing this movie again!Co-existence. This world isn't built for one type of person. Since we live together, we have to find some common ground to get along with each other; cuz we really all are the same, as much as we may not want to, or don't realize it.",Freedom Writers
264,hmsegen,A movie people should watch,9,16 January 2019,"Freedom writers is a movie which show ideal of school education. It shows not only racial conflict which is serious social problem in the US, but also a educational problem in a school. There are four races in the school, which is like small world, and it is easy to understand the social issues experienced there. Specifically, the students were given up on by teachers, and didn't get appropriate education. Erin Gruwell, the main character, changes and improves the situation in her school. There are still conflicts and educational problems in the real world. This movie might tell us that we need to listen to what people want to say more.",Freedom Writers
265,jaajxrinoooo,Great,10,17 January 2019,"I think that Freedom Writers is a great movie, and I love it. At first, I was very surprised at that the development of this movie. There are many violent scenes, so I was overwhelmed. Also, I knew that it was a true story, so I should see this movie to that last. I like many scenes in this movie. One great one is the scene in which the teacher found that many diaries were in the locker. When I saw the scene,I was moved and I cried. I thought that the students who could not consult with anyone opened their mind to the teacher. Though there were many diaries, the teacher read each one carefully, I was impressed. Also, I thought that I wanted to be a teacher or mother like her. Even though, people could not solve their problems, it was helpful to have someone who they could consult about their problems.
When I finished seeing this movie, my motivation went up. I thought that if I work hard on something, someone will respond surely. I don't have this movie now, so I can't see it again soon. However, I love it, so I will rent and see it. I'm happy to see this.",Freedom Writers

I am not emotional pertaining to TV or movies but I was brought to tears on more than one occasions during this movie. I feel that this should be a must see for every teenager in America. I will be sure to tell everyone I know to watch this. I strongly suggest this movie to you if you are debating on what movie to get one your cable on demand channel.The issue of race is brewing in the under-culture of our country now and I think that sometimes yes, it can be something as simple as a book or a movie that can make a person sit back and think about how they act. This is one of those movies. This movie will cause you to run the full gantlet of emotions. Anger, fear, pride, humor, embarrassment, resentment, and finally hope.

This film is a tour de force of brilliant screen writing, direction, and story telling at it's absolute best.It made me want to be a better person.Hiliary Swank, Patrick Dempsey, and Scott Glenn are three biggest ""names"" in the film unless you're of a slightly older generation, then you'll remember character actress Pat Carroll in what could be her final film appearance and to quote a friend, it's a doozy.
