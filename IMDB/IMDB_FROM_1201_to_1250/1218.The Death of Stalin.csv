0,MartinHafer,Far better than I expected.,9,14 April 2020,"""The Death of Stalin"" is a somewhat fact-based film. In other words, it tries its best to recreate the events around the time of Stalin's death, though the sources aren't exactly unbiased or 100% truthful....and sometimes the writers needed to infer what was said and done behind closed doors. Look at it as the best guess as to the events instead....and in this sense and many others the movie is marvelous and very well made.
The story begins shortly before Stalin's death from a cerebral hemorrhage. The machinations before and especially after are what is intriguing about the story....and how various evil scum surrounding Stalin all vied for power after his demise. It culminates with a very vivid and bloody scene...of a man who truly deserved his fate but watching it is NOT for the faint of heart.Apart from a bit of violence that might be off-putting (after all, the Stalinist regime was one of the most brutal and bloody in history), the film is a delight to watch. Excellent acting, amazing makeup and an interesting story all work together to make a really exciting film...well worth seeing.",The Death of Stalin
1,TheLittleSongbird,One of the best films of 2017,9,22 October 2017,"It must have been very daunting to make a film revolving around the period during the death of one of the world's most notorious dictators and mass murderers Joseph Stalin and its aftermath, and make it one that was entertaining, clever and beautifully produced and acted while not trivialising the horrors of the time.'The Death of Stalin' embraced this challenge and fully succeeded in its goal. 'The Death of Stalin' was one of those films where expectations were high (considering there are some truly great actors here) and those expectations were only met but exceeded. It won't be for the faint hearted, it can be violent in a very gruesome sense. While it is very evocative and well-researched, it is history but not quite as we know it (kind of like a more sophisticated version of Horrible Histories). Some may have a problem with the film not having authentic Soviet accents, and instead a mix of English and US ones, to me this was not a problem as there are many adaptations of Russian literature that mostly don't attempt authentic accents and when they are attempted it has wildly variable results.2017 has been a very hit and miss year from personal opinion for films. Some very good to great films and also some less than average to rubbish ones, as well as ones that fall somewhere in between. Some may say that for any year in film, but to me 2017 was one of the most hit and miss. 'The Death of Stalin' is a clear highlight. Didn't find that much wrong with it, the character of Svetlana is not as interesting and doesn't have the same depth as the rest of the characters perhaps but this is compensated by Andrea Riseborough still making the most of what she has. The occasional clunker in the writing too but they are vastly out shadowed by the rest of the script being so good.Even with a couple of minor reservations, 'The Death of Stalin' as said succeeds in achieving a very difficult task and achieving an ideal balance. Despite how it sounds it is not even close to being as offensive as it easily could have been, making something funny out of one of the darkest (maybe the darkest though it's not in a particularly good, if nowhere near as terrible, state now either periods for Russia/The Soviet Union)on paper does not sound tasteful, but 'The Death of Stalin' splendidly works its way around that potential issue.Visually, 'The Death of Stalin' looks beautiful. The settings and costumes are meticulous in detail and evocative, a lot of homework went into recreating this period, looking both sumptuous and atmospheric. The cinematography is fluid and natural and has the right amount of grit and audaciousness. The music has a mix of the rousing and understated.Armando Iannucci directs with complete command and control of the subject, his trademark touches of political amorality and dark and sometimes broad but witty and offbeat humour come through loud and clear. He doesn't try to soften reality, nor does he try to make it one big joke, he could easily have done that but he doesn't and he deserves a lot of credit for that.Further good things are a clever script that has genuinely funny moments and also some truly thought-provoking ones. As soon as the opening sequence begins and happens one knows they're in for a treat. 'The Death of Stalin' is never dull and is hugely entertaining but also has a darker edge in exploring the full terror of Soviet life during the Great Terror, struggle for power and the purge and not trivialising it, it's actually pretty harrowing and poignant.One cannot talk about 'The Death of Stalin' without mentioning the uniformly outstanding cast, the standouts being Simon Russell Beale giving a performance of almost Shakespearean complexity and Steve Buscemi who bags some of the best moments.Jason Isaacs steals scenes when he appears (and Paddy Considine delights in his), Andrea Riseborough makes the most of her role and Rupert Friend being this good was a pleasant surprise. Michael Palin is indeed more subdued form than usual but it suited the character and he does it perfectly, personally like that side to him. Jeffrey Tambor is great fun and Olga Kurylenko is expressive.Summarising, really great and one of 2017's best films. 9/10 Bethany Cox",The Death of Stalin
2,SnoopyStyle,some fun with a murderous satire,7,25 March 2018,"Joseph Stalin rules the Soviet Union with an iron fist. He produces a constant stream of enemy lists which his soldiers round up nightly. He is surrounded by yes men. After a laughable threat from pianist Maria Yudina, he has a stroke. Soon, he's dead and various leaders struggle for dominance. The most ambitious are Nikita Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi) and NKVD head Lavrentiy Beria. Molotov is the fumbling Foreign Minister. Field Marshal Zhukov is the bombastic war hero. Svetlana and unstable Vasily are Stalin's children. Beria uses his secret police, stealing Khrushchev's liberal reforms, and blackmail with Khrushchev's mistress Yudina's threatening note.This political satire has a few funny moments. It's oddly light in a dark world. That's the central problem which holds it back. The historical events are dire. The dictatorial police state is apocalyptic. This movie tries to have some light fun with it. The clash between comedy and reality is never far from the surface. The other issue I have is that Buscemi always looks like Buscemi. He never strikes me as Khrushchev. I see the historical Khruschev as a big, boisterous gangster. Buscemi always looks little. I can't see him as Khrushchev. This has plenty of quirky fun but those couple of things keep pulling me out of the movie.",The Death of Stalin
3,Horst_In_Translation,Close call if this is good or not,6,30 March 2018,"""The Death of Stalin"" is a co-production between no less than 4 countries that resulted in this new English-language movie that runs for 105 minutes. Well, it is new here as it just hit cinemas in Germany a day ago before I am writing this review. The film was nominated for 2 BAFTAs not too long ago and it is the most recent work by Oscar-nominated Scottish writer Armando Iannucci, who is known for Veep mostly of course (and the comedy at the series' and this film's core is simple about very incompetent people trying to ooze competence) and for his Oscar-nominated work ""In the Loop"". Now as for this one here: the title sounds fairly serious, but if you read the name Iannucci and know a bit about him, you will understand fairly quickly that the comedy genre is dominant in here. Still the dark humor lets them get away with some more serious stuff too when it comes to intrigue, cold-blooded murder even and of course actual historic events. There is much more in here than just the comedically entertaining perspective. With Buscemi and Tambor on board, they have two actors that I like quite a bit and I think they are doing a pretty great job, actually everybody here, not just these two, also some who I have not really been familiar with at all so far or just vaguely. The ensemble is perhaps the film's best component. Sets and costumes are decent too I'd say overall. And as a consequence I do believe that the film offers more positive than negative eventually. Still, there are glaring weaknesses too. It has more than just a few scenes and moments when it feels as if there is really weak focus and the movie could have been at least 15 minutes shorter if we take out all the sub-par material. And honestly, the fact that there are hilarious scenes should not make us ignore the fact that the balance between entertaining and informative is working pretty badly on some occasions. Yet the moments when they run for who gets to hug the daughter first almost manage to have us ignore that fact. And then there is the acting of course. I mentioned it before, but I definitely think that the cast makes some of the weak material look fairly strong surprisingly thanks to their individual talents.What else? Oh yeah. I would like to say that I am happy for Tambor here he is in a movie that has become quite a success really with everything going against him. Accusations and allegations without fundamental proof or eveidence should not keep us from enjoying his art and boy is he an artist. He shows it again here being part of many of the film's funniest moments. Thanks Jeffrey. Enough with that now though. I think this is certainly on a better level than Veep overall, which at some point just turned into unfunny try-hard anti-conservative propaganda, but today we shall not talk any further in detail about the JLD show. This movie we got here is almost never boring and very frequently hits the nail right on the head at least for me. I do think though that the comedy is not for everybody, so if you won't enjoy the approach in the first 15-20 minutes, you can probably switch it off because not too much is gonna change to be honest afterward in terms of style and atmosphere. For me it is a close call if I should give the film a thumbs-up and positive recommendation or a thumbs-down and negative recommendation, but Iannucci and his many writers here nail the comedic parts well enough for me to go for the former and actually the ending wasn't too bad either, so I will be generous and think that you can give this film a chance. It is not one of the best comedies, let alone films, of the year, but it is worth seeing if you like some of the actors here as much as I do. Go give it a chance, but don't expect Hitler in here or Cold War conflicts as this is really all about the Soviets and their power struggles. A subject complex enough for sure.",The Death of Stalin
4,Prismark10,A communist plot,8,25 February 2018,"You might think The Death of Stalin was a parody or a black comedy or a farce. We know that the actors are playing actual people some of whom lived until the late 1980s. The weird thing is the actual events depicted in the movie happened in some form.In real life, when Stalin was lying on the floor in his soiled pajamas after he suffered a stroke. They needed to call a meeting to decide whether to call a doctor. Stalin's personal physician was unavailable as he was being tortured at the time for suggesting Stalin needed more bed rest.Armando Iannucci mines comedy gold in an absurd, surreal, darkly violent tale of who wants to be the next leader of the Soviet Union. It is not a historical tale, it is a story of what can happen in any society where dogma and the bullet become the main currencies.",The Death of Stalin
5,nogodnomasters,Stalin would be proud.,10,27 December 2018,"Seriously? Moscow was run by the Keystone cops after Stalin died? The period right after Stalin's death was in turmoil as the ministers scramble for power, pretending to like each other. Steve Buscemi played Nikita Khrushchev like Steve Buscemi in ""The Big Lebowski"" and not the Khrushchev I saw on TV. He actually gave the guy a great sense of humor and personality.I personally don't know how much of the film has any historical accuracy, but it was the best death film since ""The Death of Mary Queen of Scots."" I believe Michael Palin was in that too.Guide: Lot's of swearing.",The Death of Stalin
6,kosmasp,Based on true events,9,14 July 2018,"More or less I guess - but the movie never goes into details what truly happened, rather keeping the satire and fun up. The acting is superb and the humor is as dark and twisted as you can imagine. PC this isn't, quite the opposite. And you can understand why some Russians might not like certain depictions of historical figures and events.So if you like wicked entertainment and are not afraid to laugh even when it seems wrong to do so, remember this is just a movie, so it's ok here. It's not like you are rooting for someone evil in reality. Also Jason Isaacs almost steals the movie entirely. There is nuance and there is just flat out ridiculous. But all in great quality and entertainment.",The Death of Stalin
7,Sleepin_Dragon,"Funny, scary, dark, take from it what you will!",9,26 October 2017,"The Death of Stalin is one of those films you will either love or just not get at all. Being someone with a big interest in Politics, and an interest in the events of the Soviet Union this was always going to be must watch. The material itself is almost frightening, some pretty horrific real life events happening, but performed in a way that you can't help but laugh at, albeit sometimes with a little dread.Superbly written as you'd expect by Armando Iannucci, if anyone knows political satire it's him! Steve Buscemi and Simon Russell Beale shine particularly.It's one of those films I want to see again. 9/10",The Death of Stalin
8,classicsoncall,"""I've had nightmares that made more sense than this!""",10,5 August 2019,"This is the kind of brilliant parody and satire I enjoy the most. It has a Coen Brothers feel to it, and that would have been my guess if the actual director hadn't been Armando Iannucci, a name I'm not familiar with but one which I will surely look up for more of his work. To be sure, the subject matter isn't such to be trivialized or made the subject of derision, but it's done so well you have to overlook the historical record and go with the absurdity of it all. And who knows, perhaps the members of the Soviet Politburo during the Fifties actually were this discombobulated and farcical behind the scenes, making things up as they go and rewriting policy on a dime when situations dictated it.I thought Steve Buscemi was the best here in his portrayal of Nikita Khruschev, but all the players turned in splendid performances. It probably helps if one were alive during the tumultuous period of the Fifties and early Sixties when a lot of these Russian names were in the news on almost a daily basis. Personally, my favorite moniker from that era was that of Anastas Mikoyan; it had just a wonderful ring to it. The actor Paul Whitehouse who represented Mikoyan was only introduced in a brief scene and didn't have anything to do during the rest of the story but I enjoyed hearing his name mentioned anyway. Jeffrey Tambor is conflictedly brilliant as Stalin's next in line, Georgy Malenkov, just one of the many characters here who had to perform a dual role on opposite sides of an argument to maintain a seat at the Committee table.Best of all are those sidebar scenes of Russian citizens being rounded up and given the treatment, like falling down stairs and being questioned by authorities. The dialog is absurdly comical, and I thought it great when Khruschev prefaced his 'We Will Bury You' speech at the Polish embassy in Moscow in 1956. Here he was addressing the corpse of Beria when he stated ""I will bury you in history, you fat f....."". Sorry I can't spell it out, but it was that kind of movie.Anyway, this won't be everyone's best choice of entertainment, but I got a huge kick out of it, so much so I watched it twice in a row. Fortunately, one is able to criticize it and not wind up in a Gulag, so give it a shot and see if you don't come away with a skewed sense of Russian history. It's probably a lot closer to reality than we could ever imagine.",The Death of Stalin
9,jboothmillard,The Death of Stalin,5,8 October 2018,"Written and directed by Armando Iannucci (I'm Alan Partridge, The Thick of It, Veep) and co-written by David Schneider, Ian Martin and Peter Fellows, I saw film critic Mark Kermode deliberating this on The Film Review on BBC News, it looked interesting. Basically in early 1953 in Moscow, Russia, Soviet dictator Josef Stalin (Adrian McLoughlin) has been in power for almost thirty years, the ""Great Terror"" has had a heavy cloak of state paranoia for all that time. During the night, 74-year-old Stalin collapses unexpectedly and is paralysed by a brain haemorrhage, his body is discovered the following morning, he died of a stroke. Members of the Central Committee are alerted and frenetic surge of raw panic spreads like a virus as they scramble to maintain order, weed out the competition, and, ultimately, take power. During this gut-wrenching roller-coaster of incessant plotting, tireless machinations, and frail allegiances, absolutely no one is safe, not even the feared chief of the secret police, Lavrenti Beria (Simon Russell Beale). Council member Nikita Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi) does his best to maintain order and thwart Beria's plans. Stalin's body is laid in state in the Hall of Columns, there are four days of national mourning, he is given a state funeral, organised by Khrushchev, Georgy Malenkov (Jeffrey Tambor), Vyacheslav Molotov (Michael Palin), and Beria, he was buried in Lenin's Mausoleum. Also starring Quantum of Solace's Olga Kurylenko as Maria Veniaminovna Yudina, Paddy Considine as Andreyev, Rupert Friend as Vasily Stalin, Jason Isaacs as Field Marshal Zhukov, Paul Whitehouse as Anastas Mikoyan, Andrea Riseborough as Svetlana Stalin, Dermot Crowley as Lazar Kaganovich, Roger Ashton-Griffiths as Musician 1 and Jeremy Limb as Musician 2. From what I understand, it sticks to the basics of the historical facts, but one of the big jokes is, all the characters are an array of British and American accents, rather than Russian, it is a funny concept, accompanied by well-played performances and a witty script, I will admit I lost my way with of the many of the discussions of politics and state affairs, but it is an interesting political satire comedy. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Adapted Screenplay and Outstanding British Film of the Year. Worth watching!",The Death of Stalin
10,Tweekums,A comedy about the paranoid aftermath of the death of a tyrant,9,29 May 2019,"In Stalin's Soviet Union everybody is terrified of offending the 'great man'; especially those closest to him. They all know the slightest mistake will lead to their deaths. When he suffers a cerebral haemorrhage at his dacha members of the Central Committee hurry to the scene... if he survives they want him to know how concerned they were but should he die they want to be ready to further their own careers. He does die and his deputy, Georgy Malenkov, is declared the new leader. However he is clearly a weak man and others, notably head of the Moscow party, Nikita Khrushchev, and the head of the NKVD, Lavrentiy Beria start planning to take ultimate control. As preparations are made for the funeral the scheming only intensifies and other members of the committee try to identify who will come out on top so they can support the winner and avoid the fate of those who upset Soviet leaders.One would expect a subject like this to be treated very seriously; after all Stalin was one of the worst tyrants the world has known and those jockeying to replace him were at least complicit in his crimes... however this portrayal is comic; and rightly so; tyrants deserve to be laughed at. The comedy is derived from the characters behaviour; each waiting to see which way the political wind blows before making a decision; often changing opinions mid-sentence. The cast, which includes plenty of well-known faces, does a fine job; always playing things straight which often serves to make things even funnier. While it is funny it is also very tense as the characters know one wrong word could be fatal. It may not be one hundred percent factually accurate but that doesn't matter too much given that it is a comedy not an historical drama. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of dark comedy.",The Death of Stalin
11,Quinoa1984,"Russian ""Backstabbers"" by the Comrade OJays",8,29 March 2018,"This is like Dr. Strangelove but with fewer laughs (and I should say rightfully so!) and not as great an aesthetic... But then again thats a tall friggin order to fill. Taking place all within the first days if Stalin's death (with a sort of prologue showing the night before, which includes the obvious and ridiculous but probably very true set piece of an orchestra having to do their live performance again, audience included, because it wasn't recorded, plus the stroke that got him), this is satire so thick in its darkness you will get lost trying to find your way out.  With a couple of tweaks this could have been a straightforward and highly believable biopic on that period when Stalin's death revealed the many maggots writhing underneath the Red facade. Luckily Iannuci has learned from the masters - Michael Palin being here isnt an accident I'm guessing (Holy Grail was shot with the look of Pasolini influence) - that if you have an authentic backdrop, everything else you can buy into. While everyone using their own accents might seem distracting to some, I dug it; it's like, hey, you know what? Lets not kid ourselves with putting on phoney-baloney accents. It makes for a wholly unique, unnerving, often funny experience that I won't forget for a while. By the way, it's banned in Russia... Sure. They'll allow The Road Movie, but this?",The Death of Stalin
12,CinemaSerf,"A comedic tale of tyranny and treachery - could have been so much better, though!",6,28 December 2020,"I can only imagine just how humourless existence in Stalinist Russia must have been at this time of austerity and fear, and so this concept from the hugely imaginative mind of Armando Ianucci - making comedic silk from the sows ear was quite an intriguing prospect. The start of the film, really works - we are introduced to the man himself, and to his politburo of yes men who, upon his sudden demise, have to deal with all the consequences. These scenarios are based on real events and the intricacies with which the erstwhile colleagues manoeuvre themselves using his family and play off their colleague all rings true. Aside from a superb Simon Russell Beale (Beria), though, the characterisations don't work so well. The pace of the film is frenetic, the dialogue fast-paced and frequently quite pithy but somehow Steve Buscemi (Kruschev), Michael Palin (Molotov) and an almost ""Herman Munster"" like Jeffrey Tambor as Malenkov seem to offer us parodies of these really tyrannical people that suggest they were little better than incompetent, though fiercely ruthless and competitive, fools. Rupert Friend has some fun as the late dictator's rather demented son but otherwise I'm afraid that I found the joke wore too thin too quickly an what we were left with was more of a silly farce, than a black comedy. Enjoyable enough to watch, though.",The Death of Stalin

Council member Nikita Khrushchev does his best to maintain order and thwart Beria's plans.Written and directed by Armando Iannucci, who gave us the brilliant political satires 'The Thick of It', 'In the Loop' and 'Veep' this movie has Iannucci's trademark political intrigue combined with satirical humour. Very funny at times.However, while the drama and the comedy of his previous efforts meshed perfectly together, largely because the comedy was making fun of the drama, here it doesn't work well. The drama - mass executions, torture, a callous disregard for life - is at odds with the comedy. It becomes difficult to laugh at the antics of the Russian ministers when just a second previously you saw someone executed at their whim. It would have worked better as a straight drama, showing the fall-out of Stalin's death. Making this a straight comedy would have been impossible.Overall: watchable, for the comedy moments.",The Death of Stalin
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Nod as I'm speaking to you. People are looking to me for reassurance and I have no idea what's going on.,8,5 November 2020,"1953. When Stalin suddenly dies, the Council of Ministers scramble for power. There's a very simple problem: The man's endless paranoia meant he preferred to surround himself with people that would never think of joining forces to assassinate him. As such, they're a contemptible bunch, who despise and mistrust each other as a matter of course. How could they possibly determine who should be in charge?There's an early scene in this where Joseph, The General Secretary himself, is not quite perished. He appears to be unable to speak, and simply points, in order to communicate, the only thing his body is still capable of doing, and with what may well be his last breath. The half-dozen high-ranking individuals present all try desperately to guess what he is trying to convey. Maybe he's trying to indicate who should take over his position? No, it's definitely something about that painting! He's saying... we saved him? No, he's celebrating the people flourishing under socialism! Maybe he's asking for something to drink...? Quick! Somebody get him a glass! Make sure it's water! Not milk, he hates that!It reminded me a lot of that bit in the Life of Brian, where the the titular apparent Messiah, accidentally drops one of his sandals, while fleeing his followers. These faithful immediately try to to build religious tenets around this seemingly meaningless act, that may not even be done on purpose. I believe this is intentional, as this even casts one of the Monty Python crew in a major role. In general, they got the exact right actors for this, and they're all bringing their a-game.I'm not going to spoil here whether or not we find out what he was trying to say with that otherwise futile last gesture. Honestly, I think focusing on that misses the forest for the trees. What is crucial to both of these sequences, is that we are watching all these people grasp at straws. Trying desperately to understand that, which, if not understood, might suddenly kill them, for no readily discernible reason. This shows how they were always leaping back and forth, all the time, between the extremes of execution and safety from it. It's like maneuvering a minefield. Part of how it conveys this is that It uses many different types of comedy, to great effect. You never know exactly what kind of joke you're going to get next. There's a scene in the politburo which is worth the price of admission by itself.This film captures perfectly just how unpredictable the Soviet Union was. And how easily someone who, through their loyalty, thought they were relatively safe, can suddenly be victims. We are not talking about a meritocracy. All of the best generals and doctors were killed, each of them suspected of conspiracy and treason. If you were personally close to the ruler, you had to constantly do things that he wanted, to keep him pleased, and thus not so eager to have others murdered. And for the vast majority of his people, you couldn't even attempt to do that. You could live your life, doing your best to live up to his is utterly impossible standards, and one day, out of the blue, the NKVD show up, and your family never sees you again. I doubt anyone who didn't experience it can truly understand the extreme level of constant dread these people lived in.I think it is important to to have the discussion whether or not this is the right way to attempt to cope with the countless tragedies of the ill-fated USSR. We should consider if if the gallows humour of this is disrespectful to the 50 million people who died in their own country, a huge chunk of them due to their leader's poor decision-making, and always through no fault of their own.Personally, I find this movie is careful to mock the perpetrators of the violence, and not the victims. And I would argue that this is simply the only way to process these horrors. Which is necessary to do, to move on. And think about just how much ""The Steel Man"" would *hate* this depiction, if he had lived to see it. I see this as The Producers about The Eastern Bloc.Some details are not completely accurate to historical accounts. Still, the atrocities that this depicts *did* actually happen. A few of the events in this simply happened years prior, some individuals were in a different situation, and some liberties were taken to make this a more impactful piece of cinema. I'm not saying this applies to all negative reviews of this, but I did see several people insist that what we see in this can't have actually happened, when it literally, demonstrably, did. Others say that it's inappropriate to have so much vulgarity, and show these physically adult men behaving like immature school children, when this is exactly how these people actually did speak and carry on.This contains strong language throughout, as well as violence, and some sexual references. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys political satire. 8/10",The Death of Stalin
16,neil-476,Very funny,9,8 May 2018,"Following the death of Soviet Chairman (and effective dictator) Josef Stalin in 1953, there is a frenzied jockeying for position among the surviving senior party members.This film, which I had never heard of until a week or two ago, was not high on my list of must-see movies. I'm not particularly interested in the Russian revolution and its aftermath, and the title alone is enough to put me off - serious, drab, dreary and boring. I only went to see it because of the phenomenal cast.And I'm so glad I did. Adapted from a French comic (!), and directed and co-scripted by British satirist Armando Ianucci, this film seems to follow the main beats of what actually happened, but is very, very funny. The characterisations are brilliant - even the murderous individuals are drawn in widely comic terms - and the actors playing them have great fun. Jason Isaacs plays the head of the Russian army in a medal-heavy tunic, and with a broad and foul-mouthed Yorkshire accent - ""Who locked the soldiers up?"" Michael Palin and Jeffrey Tambor play Molotov and Malenkov as hardline party members who sway like reeds in the wind to stay within perceived safe guidelines. Steve Buscemi plays Krushchev as endlessly frustrated at being outmanoeuvred by the Machiavellian Beria.This is nothing like the film I expected it to be, and I enjoyed it enormously.",The Death of Stalin
17,AlsExGal,How difficult to make a parody built around the death of one of the worst men to ever live...,8,2 November 2019,"... and yet this film does just that. It revolves around the power struggle that occurs at the death of Stalin in 1953, a man who had an iron grip on Russia for 30 years and enforced his will with terror, often randomly.So when the sycophants who surround him are suddenly bereft of his soul, they are all jockeying for power while finding it very difficult to do the one thing that would get you tortured and killed as long as they can remember - independent thinking, or even making suggestions for that matter. A simple show of hands vote becomes a hilarious demonstration of group think. They all have a collective case of Stockholm Syndrome when it comes to Stalin, still afraid of a man who is dead.Jeffrey Tambor is doing his character Hank from the 90s sitcom ""The Larry Sanders Show"", and Steve Buschemi, as Nikita Khrushchev, doesn't look like any picture of Khrushchev that I ever saw at any point in his life. Plus he's basically doing his ""funny looking guy"" schtick from Fargo, and yet it all works.When Lavrenti Beria, head of the secret police and probably responsible for untold terrors, gently tells Stalin's daughter that she needs to leave Russia because people who are strange like she is don't live very long, it is practically a sweet intimate moment that runs counter to everything we know about the guy.This is a bleak yet hilarious comedy built around real events. I'd highly recommend it.",The Death of Stalin
18,ferguson-6,not the sharpest satire,6,9 March 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. Having previously lampooned the political landscape of England (IN THE LOOP, ""The Thick of it"") and the United States (""Veep""), writer/director Armando Iannucci turns his skewering pen and clear eye to a bygone era in Russia. Based on the graphic novel by Fabien Nury, the film takes place in 1953 Moscow at the height (and the end) of Josef Stalin's reign.Stalin's NKVD Security Forces (think 'Secret Police') ruled by force and terror for 20 years, and most citizens lived with the daily goal of staying off ""the list"" - a place which likely resulted in imprisonment, if not death. An opening sequence featuring the live performance of an orchestra drives home the outright fear that hovered over every part of that society. To be clear, Iannucci's approach is less ominous and more Mel Brooks. It's slapstick satire with profanity. Following the death of Stalin (it's not a spoiler if it's in the title!), what follows is a Keystone Cops medley of jockeying for power amongst the members of Stalin's cabinet. Closed-door plotting abounds - though sometimes in full view of others - and alliances come and go in the blink of an eye. It plays out on screen as more spoof than satire, so brace for over-the-top performances from Steve Buscemi (as Nikita Khrushchev), Simon Russell Beale (as Lavrenti Beria), Jeffrey Tambor as dimwitted doofus Malenkov, and Monty Python alum Michael Palin as Molotov. Rupert Friend and Andrea Riseborough play Stalin's (Adrian McLoughlin) offspring, and other supporting work comes from Olga Kurylenko, Paddy Considine, Tom Brooke, and Jason Isaacs.I watched this film the day after watching RED SPARROW, and the two films provide an interesting and oddball comparison to different eras of Russian history. Iannucci's film is nothing short of a full bore attack on Kremlin activities, as well as the self-interested actions of politicians that seems to remain prevalent in modern days. It's also a reminder that being ""better as a committee"" has as many flaws as the rein of a tyrant. There is a terrific final shot in a concert hall, where seated behind Khrushchev and his wife is a leering Leonid Brezhnev ... foreshadowing future events. And if that's not enough, the closing credits are as nuts as the film itself.",The Death of Stalin

20,deloudelouvain,That's what I call a good satirical movie.,8,7 August 2018,"Nothing better than stumbling on a movie like this one without having a clue what it's going to be. I thought it was going to be a political movie about the life of Stalin, with cruel images and a dark sad story. But the truth is that it was quite the opposite, it's about Stalin, it's about that cruel passage in history, but it's satirical. I should have guessed it though when I saw the cast, with Paul Whitehouse (The Fast Show), with Jeffrey Tambor (Arrested Development), with Michael Palin (The Monty Python), and with Steve Buscemi (Fargo, The Big Lebowski). They are all actors that at one point made me laugh so hard. The Death Of Stalin, with such a great cast, is just hysterical at some points if you can get the paranoia those people lived in at that time, where you had to watch out for every single word you said, or for every opinion you had. In this movie it's just about that, the fear of doing or thinking something against the regime. So to me The Death Of Stalin was a pleasant surprise and I could only recommend it to anybody that likes satire.",The Death of Stalin
21,SimonJack,There's great satire in the reality of Soviet succession,9,11 February 2019,"""The Death of Stalin"" is a wonderful, biting satire of the Soviet Union, period. The plot is all about the death of the biggest mass murderer in history, and the scramble for power in the next few days. But that's the story of the Soviet Union from its beginning. Only, with Stalin in power for so many years, the U.S.S.R., and the world, hadn't experienced the political trauma of a change in the Soviet for a long time. Those who lived from World War II to the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, know all too well that there were immense - and deadly - power struggles within Russia.This film puts dialog, details and people together in a scenario of how it probably happened. This is a very funny yet serious satire about the Soviet leadership. The filmmakers said that they didn't want to make it a whimsical or hilarious comedy in deference to the memories of the millions of people who were killed under Stalin. So, this film doesn't trivialize what Stalin and company did. Instead, the plot plays a straight drama about first doubting Stalin's death, and then scrambling for power in the aftermath. And in that - the real behavior and ingrained methods of the Soviet leadership, the satire rises almost to a roar.This is an excellent production in all aspects. All of the cast are superb. Steve Buscemi is especially good as Nikita Khrushchev. And, Simon Beale was outstanding in the role of Lavrenti Beria. He also had an uncanny resemblance to Beria. The cast includes actors for all the principal Soviet roles at the time of Stalin's demise, including his son and daughter.Some people may be bothered by the almost constant shooting of people by Russian police and military. No doubt it's exaggerated but it drives home the point of widespread paranoia that must have existed. Reprisals, denunciations and executions were very real and frequent under the Soviets.So, besides the comedy and satire, this film has some historical value. To date, no other film has been made that deals with the Soviet leadership and succession over the years. Until that is done, this film will fit that need nicely.",The Death of Stalin

It's based on the French graphic novel 'La mort de Staline', by Fabien Nury and Thierry Robin. It was directed by Armando Iannucci, and it was scripted by Iannucci, David Schneider, Ian Martin and Peter Fellows. The film stars Steve Buscemi, Simon Russell Beale, Jeffrey Tambor, Andrea Riseborough, Rupert Friend, Jason Isaacs, Michael Palin, Paddy Considine, Olga Kurylenko and Adrian McLoughlin. It's gotten almost unanimously positive reviews from critics, and it's playing in indie theaters now. I found it to be really witty and always interesting, it's also definitely dark and disturbing though. The story takes place in 1953 Moscow, when Joseph Stalin (McLoughlin) has a brain hemorrhage and collapses. The members of the Central Committee all panic, and become divided on what should be done about it. Some, including the chief of police Lavrentiy Beria (Beale), devise plans on how they can benefit from the loss of leadership. The entire movie is played out in an extremely satirical way, with lots of comical political commentary. The film is definitely always amusing, and pretty funny. The cast is all brilliant in their performances, and of course the script is extremely witty and clever. I also learned a great deal about that particular time in history, although I've read that the film is filled with inaccuracies about it. It's also an extremely horrific and dark subject matter obviously, so it does seem odd to play it out in such a seemingly lighthearted comedic way. If you don't mind really dark political humor, that's based on actual historical tragedy, you should probably enjoy it.",The Death of Stalin
24,cherold,"funny, engaging, and very dark",8,20 June 2018,"This dark comedy follows the devious machinations of various communist leaders after Stalin has a heart attack. This is political humor with bullets, as the plotting goes on amidst a backdrop of torture, assassination, and mass arrests.The cast is excellent, particularly Simon Russell Beale as a Dick-Cheney-like monster and Andrea Riseborough and Rupert Friend as Stalin's sharp-witted daughter and hilariously bonkers son. The series paints a portrait of a strange world where people are in awe of and terrified by Stalin; even people he unjustly arrested and tortured seem genuinely enamored of him. It's weird, but there's apparently an element of truth to it, perhaps because Russians so loved their revolution that they couldn't hate the part of Stalin they associated with it.But the series clearly isn't interested in historical accuracy. When I saw the ""historical accuracy"" section in the wikipedia entry for this film I was surprised to think there was any at all (there's a *little*, although some Russian scholars seem to really hate the movie).Highly recommended.",The Death of Stalin
25,paul2001sw-1,On satire and monsters,7,13 April 2018,"Armando Iannucci's political British and U.S.-set comedies have shown how systems encourage the worst people and incentivise the most perverse of behaviours. In 'The Death of Stalin', he takes his sharp eye to Russia, and tells the story of the power struggle between Beria and Khrushchev that followed Stalin's death. As usual with Iannucci, the comedy comes through everyone acting always in character, only worse. There's certainly no whitewashing here, although Beria, who was purged, is shown as more competent and maybe even more human than his rivals. But the film doesn't feature Russian actors or dialogue, and Iannucci's best work speaks specifically of the delusions of the countries in which it is set; aside from Jeffrey Tambor's Malenkov, the other characters feel more drawn from the traditions of countries from which their actors hail. And only in 'The Thick of It' has Iannucci ever made me love his awful creations. Perhaps the limitation here is that few people today have any remaining illusions about Stalin and his cronies; it might have been more subversive (although not more accurate) to show them in a warmer light.",The Death of Stalin
26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Without the humour, it would've been still been a great historical drama; with it, it's a downright fantastic, satirical one.",7,3 July 2018,"There are some genuine laughs to be had when this historical satire leans into its farcical, sometimes slightly absurdist, nature or allows the incompetent clambers and random observations of its characters to pierce through its striking period-accuracy but 'The Death Of Stalin (2017)' is also a pretty dark picture that paints a detailed vision of back-stabbing, blood-shed and brutality under the guise of a political party aiming to clean-up after one of history's most ruthless dictators. It's a scenario that seems scarily close to home - despite the many years since its occurrence - and proves that horror and comedy aren't all that far apart. It is precisely because the piece renders its very real events so very realistically - only taking significant liberties in the way it condenses the narrative - that it works so well. Even without the humour, this would've been a brilliant historical drama. With it, however, it's elevated to a new level, one that allows it to be easily accessed by all and makes its most dire of moments slightly more digestible while also lampooning the decisions and mindsets behind them, which are both often incredibly hypocritical and counter-intuitive. It's surprising that nobody has made a flick about this period of history before, as it is so thematically rich and ripe with drama. The fact that it has been given the subtle, satirical and intelligent treatment it has makes it all the more engaging and, surprisingly, entertaining, despite the weight that comes with knowing pretty much all of it actually happened. 7/10",The Death of Stalin
27,richardchatten,Carry On Up the Kremlin,8,22 October 2017,"I have a nodding acquaintance with the era and personalities depicted, so quickly became aware that liberties were being taken. Stalin was found comatose in his pyjamas several hours after fears were initially roused by his failure to ring for his morning tea. In this account his housekeeper just marches in with the tray to find him on the floor still in uniform having suffered a stroke the night before laughing at a poison pen letter. It also took him much longer to actually die - stretched out for three days on his sofa - than conveyed in this telling. Even those actually present were probably too fuelled by adrenalin to afterwards accurately recall exactly just what did happen.Just as films depicting the last days of Hitler never accurately depict the shrunken, shuffling wreck that the Führer was by April 1945, so Adrian Mcloughlin's cockney Stalin is far more vigorous than the white-haired 74 year-old in failing health that Stalin actually was in his final months. Steve Buscemi's Khrushchev seems pretty accurate, although I found Buscemi's growing resemblance to Gomez Addams rather distracting (my personal favourite screen Khrushchev was the late Brian Glover, who played him twice on TV during the early '80s). Michael Palin - bless him - I couldn't believe for a moment as Molotov; but Simon Russell Beale is something else entirely as Beria, and it is he who dominates the film. Perhaps because I'm less familiar with the physical appearances of the originals, I found the cameos by Paul Whitehouse as Mikoyan, Paul Chahidi as Bulganin and Dermot Crowley as Kaganovich satisfying; while Sylvestre Le Touzel and Diana Quick make interesting and understated appearances as the wives of Khrushchev and Molotov. The funniest of the cast is easily Jason Isaacs covered in medals as a macho, north-country Marshal Zhukov.Armando Iannucci has plainly had a lavish budget to play with, and being prone to motion sickness I found myself overwhelmed both by the plushness of the production as well as Zac Nicholson's Steadicam photography, which made the gargantuan Stalinist epic 'The Fall of Berlin' (1949) seem by comparison a model of understatement and restraint.",The Death of Stalin
28,bowmanblue,So many British Russians,6,5 July 2018,"I've been a fan of Armando Iannucci ever since his early satirical 'Friday Night Armistice' shows making fun of political events. He's always displayed a wry take on modern life which has showed through in his own shows and, of course 'The Thick of It.' Therefore, I watched 'The Death of Stalin' simply to continue watching his output. Now, having seen it, I am left feeling a little disappointed, but I can't help but think that's it's my fault.I studied post Second World War history, but only the WESTERN aspects to it, i.e. European and American. I knew little of what was going on in the Soviet Union, only that the 'Cold War' kicked off and the Russians were always the baddies in the Bond films. As the title suggests the story charts the last days (or even hours!) of Soviet dictator's Stalin's life and then the subsequent power struggle which ensued from all his deputies and surrounding high-ranking staff.There's quite a large cast and, impressively, they're all played by excellent actors (mainly recognisable faces from British film and TV output, but you also have Steve Buscemi and Jeffrey Tambor in there somewhere). Each of these plays the part of a real-life person from Stalin's inner circle. And, just to help out those of us (like me!) who know nothing about this aspect of history, they all get their own caption reminding us who they are and what they do in Stalin's dictatorship. However, despite these clues, they didn't go far to help me understanding who they are, what they do, or what their political motivations are.I get the feeling that if I knew about the real events which inspired this film, I'd be able to watch it and therefore point knowingly at the screen from time to time and say 'Ah, Michael Palin is playing so-and-so. He was responsible for this, that or the other in Stalin's regime.' However, seeing as I know nothing about anything relating to this time period, all I could say was, 'Oh, that's Michael Palin. He was good in Monty Python.'Then there were the accents. Yes, I know this is possibly the most 'pickiest' of flaws that anyone can find in a movie. But, because 90% of the cast were British (and therefore come from all over the country) they all speak with various (British!) accents. I know that not every actor is gifted with the ability of putting on a convincing Russian accent, but it just felt really weird to me watching someone with a northern accent pretending to be a Russian cabinet minister. For example, because Steve Buscemi doesn't try to disguise his natural US accent, I thought he was some sort of American ambassador to the government, until I realised he was part of it.The cast is excellent. They're clearly all having fun and you can see they're all having a good time working on this story. And, if you know even a tiny bit about the historical events behind it, you should love it as much as I wished I did. However, for me, personally, I just couldn't seem to get behind it, no matter how good the cast is. Just check out the general ratings for the film - they're pretty high. If you're wondering whether to watch the film or not, I think you should definitely go with their views over mine. Sorry, Armando - but, don't worry, I'll still watch everything you go on to write.",The Death of Stalin

It's a great cast and there are lots of amusing moments, but I confess it was tough for me to truly love this one, probably because of the subject matter and its overall tone. Some aspects of the comedy are hilarious - the deference to the supreme leader in some scenes, and the various jockeying for power in others - but there is quite a bit that is not, e.g. the murder depictions and rape references. I would have liked it better as a farce without these elements because of just how horrifying the actual history is, or as a more factual historical drama.",The Death of Stalin
30,Cineanalyst,Political Stupidity,6,2 November 2019,"Stalin's death hasn't been this amusing since ""Children of the Revolution"" (1996), which isn't something I though I'd ever write. Armando Iannuci and company transplant their brand of political farce from liberal Western democracies lampooned previously, with ""In the Loop"" (2009) and the HBO series ""Veep,"" to the transition of authoritarian power in the post-Stalin Soviet Union. As others have criticized, ""The Death of Stalin"" is riddled with historical inaccuracies, but Iannuci's prior, aforementioned work isn't amusing for fidelity or even cutting satire, either. It's always a bunch of cruel numbskulls yelling at and backstabbing each other. But, now, it's in the USSR, so people are slaughtered, too. The result is an uneven black comedy.Gallows humor works well enough, I suppose, when members of the politburo are executed, but it's another thing entirely when the masses are being shot and trampled to death. The movie is given too much credit by some for being supposedly insightful; it's not. Obviously, the USSR and Stalinism was a disaster, and making the men in charge into caricatures doesn't really lend any enlightenment upon that. Don't get me wrong, though; politics is worthy of mockery. After a slow start (the opera stuff seems particularly irrelevant and unfunny) and despite a lot of misfires, ""The Death of Stalin"" can be humorous at times. The tempo especially picks up after Steve Buscemi, leading a well-rounded cast, begins to take over as Khrushchev. With him, one moment, joking around with his cohorts that he would just as soon have shot in the head if it were to his Machiavellian interests, Buscemi could just as well be playing his gangster parts in ""The Sopranos"" or ""Boardwalk Empire"" than as a would-be national dictator. Meanwhile, the British actors could just as well be enacting a drawing-room comedy of manners or performing a Monty Python sketch (Michael Palin, after all, is here, too, and as absurd as ever). None of this trans-Atlantic cast attempt foreign accents, but what would be the point had they, or had the cast been mainly employed of actors from the former states of the USSR. ""The Death of Stalin"" doesn't bother to reflect history or politics in profound, or even accurate, ways. It merely reinterprets it all for easy laughs.",The Death of Stalin

32,secondtake,Absurdist great fun,7,7 January 2019,"The Death of StalinThis is not a bit politically incorrect-in fact, the thing that drives this movie is the understanding (and belief) that Stalin was terrible, that his cronies were terrible, and that it's all no joking matter. So what better subject for satire?
And for the first half hour, this rolicks! It doesn't sustain belly laughs all through (the second half gets more chaotic and starts to wear thin) but it is hilarious in some many parts you can't help appreciating it. The writing and acting combine to make a sharp, smart, enjoyable romp.
What about the millions of younger viewers who don't know a twig about Stalin? I think the absurdist humor will still work, if there is at least the basic sense of a bad man surrounded by power hungry graspers.
A lot has been said about Steve Buscemi's great performance-and it's great, surely-but there are several actors who really come forward. And who combine to make a band of horrible misfits. Simon Russell Beale is great as the smart insider, Beria, and Jeffrey Tambor is also great in his caricatured excess (this movie is before his fall from grace). Smaller parts grow in importance, like Olga Kurylenko's blazing strength as Maria, and Rubert Friend and Andrea Riseborough as Stalin's unpredictable son and wild daughter.
The director, Armando Iannucci, is one of my favorites for this kind of smart, fast humor (he directed ""In the Loop"" which I love). The writing isn't afraid to step on toes or be inappropriate, which is part of what makes it funny.
You can ask, I suppose, whether the movie makes any sense in aligning the history or making us see Stalin (and 1953) any differently. But who cares? The result is a funny movie that uses an historical moment as a silly launching point. That's all.",The Death of Stalin
33,The-Sarkologist,The Farce that are Power Plays,9,1 April 2018,"Well, the circumstances surrounding Stalin's death were quite amusing, so it is not surprising that somebody decided to come along and make a movie about it, and an incredibly funny one at that. Well, when one comes to think about it, anything to do with politics and the people in power could easily be turned into a comedy. Sure, there is an element of respect that such people expect of their subjects, and those elsewhere, but in reality turning our political leaders into a collection of clowns has become a past time here in Australia, and when one starts to peal away the façade that are our rulers, it is very easy to turn them into a joke.
 This is what has been done here, and when you consider that near the end of his life, Stalin had all of the good doctors either killed or sent to the gulags, and threatened anybody who disturbed his sleep with death, so that when he had a stroke nobody dared enter his room, just in case they get marched off to either Siberia, or the firing squad, it is very easy to make this farce the subject of a comedy.
 The film begins with another of Stalin's famous prescriptions, and then contacting a radio station to ask for a recording of that night's performance, and since it wasn't recorded, the producer then rushes about to get it played again, going as far as dragging a conductor out of bed to conduct the performance in his pyjamas because the previous conductor slipped, fell, and hit his head on a metal bucket. Oh, and also dragging people in off the street to fill the house so the acoustics are right. Mind you, there is never pleasing a guy like Stalin, but fortunately for the producer, this was basically the last night of his life, so I guess he managed to dodge a bullet there.
 The movie is actually about the power struggles that went on after Stalin's death, and the power plays between the members of the central committee. In one sense this could easily be turned into a political thriller, and in part it is, but make everything just that little bit eccentric and you have the makings of a rather entertaining, and incredibly amusing film. Then again, as I mentioned, such power plays can be very funny in themselves, and sometimes dealing with some very horrific historical events, the best way to portray them is by making us laugh at them. As one law lecturer once said, there are two ways to deal with disturbing events - either take it deadly seriously and go mad, or treat it as one big black joke.
 Not surprisingly, this film didn't go down all that well in some sectors, and this does raise some quite interesting questions about how history is viewed. Sure, I can appreciate people becoming insulted when revered figures are turned into a joke - look at the flack that Life of Brian received. Yet, sometimes, to really appreciate such films, one needs to put aside the offence, and start to look at what the movie is really trying to say. In this particular film, it is not just Russia that is being mocked, but the power plays that go on behind the scenes of any political change where the leader of the party (or country) is suddenly incapacitated.
 One really interesting thing that was done was that the characters didn't have Russian accents. That wouldn't necessarily have been a problem, but they went one step further and had the actors play up their own accents. I notice that in a lot of films the actors are able to speak without their accent, which is probably needed when some accents can result in the actor not being understood. However here we have a whole mix of accents, both American and English, and it really added quite a lot of shine to the film.
 Yes, this film is pretty confronting in parts, but the confronting parts quickly pass us by to have us once again rolling around the floor in laughter at the ridiculousness of the characters. Once again, this isn't just Russia, but rather it pretty much happens everywhere - politicians can be some of the most idiotic people at times, and quite often we are left shaking our head wondering how these pole turtles ever managed to go to where they are - just look at some of the current leaders and I'm sure you will understand (and maybe we should make a farcical movie about them as well, though once again I'm sure that won't go down all that well either).",The Death of Stalin
34,clanciai,Stalin's dirty old men in deadly party quarrel after his death,8,2 March 2018,"If this is supposed to be a comedy it isn't funny. I can well understand those who couldn't stand it more than 11 minutes. It's a bitter caricature all the way of the arguments of power, the humour is darker than black and not humourous at all, and all laughters are strained to grotesqueness in morbid hypocrisy, but that is probably how it was. It all makes a very realistic impression and couldn't perhaps be staged more realistically without the satirical caricature touch. The main factor that turns them all into ridiculous parodies is that they all speak cockney, all except the pianist, who makes the deepest impression of all and who introduces the morbid farce, the one serious person in the context.Although they all constantly speak in a foul loud-mouthed way without listening to each other and almost merely making a lot of noise and fuss, it is very well acted, and what saves the film is the fine choice of music. Music introduces the spectacle and also gives it a worthy exist. It's brilliant entertainment all the way, although all laughs get stuck in the throat. Michael Palin from Monty Python is the best and most convincing actor, and the actor who plays Krushchev has a startling resemblance to Putin. Perhaps it was intentional? I heard the film was forbidden in Russia, and a cinema owner who showed it anyway was prosecuted for it. Putin has tried to exonerate Satlin, so this political portrait of an active establishment in a superpower 65 years ago could be scaringly up to date.",The Death of Stalin

This led to the brilliant spin-off feature film In the Loop, before he would go on to tackle U.S. politics with acclaimed HBO series Veep. These groundbreaking satires now seem like they were a mere warm-up for his most ambitious project yet, The Death of Stalin, which covers the panic-stricken aftermath following the demise of one of the Soviet Union most notorious dictators, Joseph Stalin.For the film, Iannucci has gathered together some of the finest British actors working today: those who are as comfortable with improvisation as they are with brooding monologues. Michael Palin is Molotov, the nervously chirpy minister who remained loyal to Stalin after the execution of his wife; Andrea Riseborough is Svetlana, Stalin's emotionally crumbled daughter; and Rupert Fried is the drunken son Vasily. Most impressive of all is Simon Russell Beale as the reptilian Lavrenti Beria, a man renowned for his love of rape and torture who is now desperately picking up the scraps and trying to seize power. Working against Beria is Steve Buscemi's Khrushchev, the former cabinet jester who may actually be the country's best bet. Trying to hold it all together is Jeffrey Tambor's timid Malenkov, who despite unwavering loyalty to his leader discovers his name on a death list before the big guy drops dead, and is installed as acting Premier shortly after.There are many belly laughs to be enjoyed in The Death of Stalin, but Iannucci's approach to the subject matter often approaches horror territory. While the worst the players in The Thick of It faced was public embarrassment or a dressing down from Malcolm Tucker, here one ill-timed comment can land you with a bullet in the head. It's an incredibly scary place, where characters stroll nonchalantly through grey buildings as screams and gunshots hum in the background, and people are taken from their homes by armed officers for some imagined slight. The comedy and tragedy are incredibly well-balanced, and intensifies the absurdity of political life to genuinely concerning levels. Watching the terrible events unfold as these desperate men stutter and scurry around like rats, willing to back-stab and manipulate their colleagues without pausing for breath if it means buying themselves some extra time, is irresistible. As you would expect, Iannucci's script (co-written by David Schneider and Ian Martin) is expletive-laden and sharp as a dagger, and the entire ensemble are at the top of their game. It's unlikely The Death of Stalin will ever see a release in Russia, but someone should definitely suggest Putin adds it to his IMDb watchlist.",The Death of Stalin

When it turns out no recording was made, the Radio Moscow manager corrals the audience and orchestra to redo the entire concert. Meanwhile, Stalin has issued more death lists and sends out his men to round up and kill the people named in the list. Then, shortly after Stalin gets the orchestra recording delivered to his office, he suffers a cerebral hemorrhage, and the Central Committee members begin scrambling to become the next Soviet leader. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is co-written and directed by none other than Armando Iannucci, the creator of HBO's ""Veep"". So I immediately thought or expected to be charmed in the best possible way. Alas, it was not to be. As the movie opened, I kept waiting for some funny stuff, or at least something, ANYTHING, to give me a reason to smile or chuckle. I didn't get any, I am sad to say. I have no idea what was going on, other than the scheming and backstabbing among the potential successors of Stalin. Much has been made about the (alleged) historical inaccuracies in the movie. I am not a historian, and so I couldn't care less whether Iannucci took an artistic license with some of the facts. If you look at the movie's poster, you'll notice that the tag line is ""A Comedy of Terrors"". I wish that were true! The reality is that this movie completely misfires, either as a comedy or as a satire, period.""The Death of Stalin"" premiered at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival. Imagine my surprise when this opened last week in both of the art-house theaters here in Cincinnati, and on multiple screens in each of them. I haven't the faintest idea why they are thinking that there is a pent-up demand for this movie. The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (less than 10 people), I couldn't help but notice that I wasn't the only one waiting for an opportunity to laugh or chuckle. I didn't hear any. Bottom line, I cannot recommend this film in good conscience to anyone, but of course I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Death of Stalin
37,Turfseer,"TV comic luminary reduces Stalin's Politburo successors to a coterie of foul-mouthed, bumbling misfits",4,27 May 2018,"A mainstream comedy writer, known for Veep on television, Armando Iannucci as director and co-writer, has ventured into the realm of a much darker subject, ""The Death of Stalin."" The genre is black comedy, a send-up, where the principal members of the Politburo vie for power following the death of Stalin of a cerebral hemorrhage on March 5, 1953. 
Most of the humor is sophomoric but occasionally there are a few moments of mirth. The dark atmosphere of Stalinism is ably conveyed in the film's introductory scene based on real events. A Radio Moscow producer forces an orchestra to replay a concerto so that a recording can be pressed for Stalin who demands it on a whim.  
A conductor is dragged out of bed, the audience is not permitted to leave and additional people from the streets are conscripted to fill out the hall (ironically most of these newly minted spectators are members of the proletariat, who have little to no interest in classical music). Historically the actual event occurred nine years prior to the terrifying dictator's death, but no matter-the bizarre nature of the various Russians' acquiescence, reveals the level of fear that gripped the populace during those unhappy times. 
Iannucci unfortunately attempts to extract humor not from an examination of a crazed bureaucracy designed to cope with terrifying circumstances-but by focusing on and then reducing Stalin's successors as a coterie of buffoons. Oddly no character sports a Russian accent but rather utilizes an unsuccessful mix of American and British doggerel. Steve Buscemi is particularly unconvincing as Khrushchev-not only doesn't he look like Stalin's eventual replacement but delivering his lines in colloquial American English, hardly sounds like the man who told an American audience at the United Nations that ""we will bury you."" 
The plot loosely follows how the various players attempt to grab their share of power following the leadership vacuum left wide open after Stalin's death. As in real life, the principal villain is NKVD state security head Lavrentiy Beria (Simon Russell Beale) who attempts to buy Foreign Minister's Molotov's (Michael Palin) loyalty by arranging for the release of his wife, denounced as a traitor and imprisoned a few years earlier by Stalin. 
Meanwhile Deputy General Secretary Georgy Malenkov (Jeffrey Tambor) is nominally put in charge of the government only to prove that he is spineless, vacillating between the various factions and failing to make any decisive decisions. Eventually it's Khrushchev who conscripts World War II Army hero Marshall Zhukov, who arrests Beria and basically arranges his execution (with the approval of the rest of the Politburo). 
Iannucci's one-note characterization of the principals as a group of foul-mouthed misfits does not jibe with the reality of their personalities. Worse is the implication that Stalinism was principally the fault of men like Beria, an overt sadist and child molester who takes on the convenient role of the fall guy here. 
Samuel Goff in his article in the Calvert Journal ""The Death of Stalin: a black comic masterpiece? Don't make me laugh,"" argues that Iannucci fails to discuss the ""mechanisms of power"" in Stalinist Russia. It's the ""faceless pencil-pushers"" who ""combine to enact mass death, the memo a more potent symbol of the system than the rifle, the whole thing a meeting of bland procedural discipline and actual murder. There is not enough banality in Iannucci's portrait of evil."" Goff rightly concludes that ""we see horror, and we see satire, but never in conjunction. The result is a lacklustre and tonally confused story about some awful men being awful to each other."" 
Whatever you believe about the men who led the Soviet Union following the tyrant Stalin's death, they were not a bunch of bumbling fools. If slapstick and a series of pratfalls are your ""thing,"" then you might actually find The Death of Stalin to be humorous. More demanding critics must require a more serious examination of a ghastly historical reality.",The Death of Stalin
38,RodrigAndrisan,Forbidden by Putin! I'm wondering why?,9,22 April 2018,"Armando Iannucci knows the craft very well, has a devilish sense of humor and has done a very good job. The film is of absolute quality and we have a whole range of acting actors: Simon Russell Beale as Beria, Michael Palin in the role of Molotov, Andrea Riseborough as Svetlana, Jason Isaacs as Zhukov, are absolutely exceptional, but the rest of the distribution too is of very high level. Alert, bold, special, worthy to be seen again and again.",The Death of Stalin
39,billcr12,Great,9,20 June 2018,Where is the publicity for this great movie. Steve Buscemi is Nikita Kruschev and a mostly English cast make it an awesome ensemble. Stalin becomes disabled by a stroke and the Russian cabinet battle for the leadership role in 1953. It is a black comedy in the vein of the Coen brothers. The script is brilliant and The Death of Stalin is one of the best films of the year. I lover The Shape of Water but this is even better. 7.2 is much to low a rating on IMDB. Rotten Tomatoes has a 100% rating.,The Death of Stalin
40,jamesrupert2014,Farcical black comedy about the end of a sanguineous era,7,9 June 2019,"Comrade Stalin is dying and senior party apparatchiks plot to survive what is expected to be a bloody transfer of power. The humor is very broad and crude at time with many of the characters played a bit 'over-the-top' (especially Jeffery Tambor's goofy Georgy Malenkov, which got tiring after a while). Steve Buschemi is fine, although not very convincing, as Nikita Khrushchev, as is Michael Palin as a weak 'yes-man' Vyacheslav Molotov. The central character, Lavrentiy Beria, is played by Simon Russell Beale, who mixes graveyard humour and menace as the vicious head of the dreaded NKVD (by all accounts (but consider the sources), the real Beria was even worse than the film portrays him). The film is a very black satire about hard, callous, and sometimes ruthless, men and some viewers may find the interspacing silly jokes with brutal and callous violence (mostly off-screen) off-putting. While far from a history lesson, many of the events in the film are grounded in fact and make interesting reading. The film would have greatly benefited by a little more wit and a little less puerility. The changing images running behind the closing credits were a both an amusing epilogue and clever commentary how things were done in the 'worker's paradise'. Next to convincing people that he doesn't exist, perhaps the Devil's second best trick was convincing people that he could be funny.",The Death of Stalin
41,PWNYCNY,Surprisingly entertaining treatment of a serious event.,10,20 February 2019,"This movie is a surprise. Steve Buscemi as Nikita Khrushchev dominates this movie. Although the story is about a group of men vying to fill a power vacuum left by the death of Stalin, what it comes down to is a contest between two men: Khrushchev and Lavrenti Beria. Whoever can gain control of the Politburo will win the battle and therefore power Although we already know from the history who won, the story nevertheless is engaging. It dramatizes the all the maneuvering that goes on, capturing the essential banality of the process and the shallowness of the contestants in the process. The movie does deviate from the some historical facts, yet still accurately depicts the dynamics that produced a transfer of power. The entire cast is wonderful. They play their respective roles well, this made more remarkable that none of the actors are Russian. Excellent movie.",The Death of Stalin
42,CubsandCulture,Dark Red Comedy,10,5 January 2019,"Very loosely inspired by the historical events this film is one part palace intrigue, one part farce and one part biting satire. The story largely concerns senior Soviet officials all trying to outmaneuver each other in order to survive; because you know the winner must kill the losers. The absurdity of the situation manifests as gaggle of one liners, in-jokes, slapstick and some very clever sight gags. (gravity meet spit). And yet for all that the film never looses focus that the stakes are life and death. When the final scene happens the violence is shocking, a gruesome in context and you feel bad for everyone. Because of the ending you just know the absurdity isn't over. The film ends with laughter darkly.A lot of this has to do with Iannucci's sharp staging and his work with the cast. He manages to keep the film light and funny without losing the necessary edge. He coaxes from all his actors a certain manic energy that fits the humor *while* reminding us they are in a dog fight for survival. Iannucci opens the film up (i.e. epic shots, crowd scenes, etc.) just enough to let the Russian people and setting though. A group malignant narcissists are in control of the state; they will kill each other sure but we all pay the price for it is the point Iannucci hammers again and again in his mise-en-scene.This is great film. I am sad I missed it in the theaters.",The Death of Stalin
43,iquine,A Unique Comedic Take on the Power Struggle After Stalin's Death,8,17 August 2020,"(Flash Review)This film was clever in balancing humor, Russian political struggle and executions. It's a dry dark comedy about a very grim subject, the reign of terror that Stalin championed. As the title states, Stalin dies and you watch his bumbling council decide on a successor and next steps are amusing. Even while the military continues executing people on 'lists' it is shown 'mostly' not graphically. Who will end up in top of the power struggle? This is actually based on real events and people but told in a very satirical manner which is highly amusing. Great dialog, acting and production values. A smart & unique comedy for a change.",The Death of Stalin
44,arthur_tafero,Buscemi Steals Funny Satire - The Death of Stalin,8,3 December 2020,"If Donald Duck could make fun of Hitler, then there is no reason why Sal Buscemi can't make fun of Nikita Khrushchev. Stalin is not really around long enough to critique, as the film starts with his demise. But be rest assured, there is non-stop satire from the moment he hits the floor, until Beria gets what he richly deserved. In many ways, truth is a lot stranger than fiction, and one gets the feeling that over 90% of this film is real. The director does an outstanding job of getting the most out of every actor, especially Buscemi, who easily steals the film. This is a real treat for the holidays and should not be missed. I thought that the best portrayal of Khrushchev in film was that role accomplished in ""Enemy at the Gates"" by Bob Hoskins, but Buscemi does the impossible, and surpasses it; especially with the Grace Kelly line that made me fall on the floor.

Sure it's a comedy about a dictator who killed millions but why carp when the laughs come hard & more importantly often.

47,robertemerald,Surprisingly historically accurate real life farce,8,4 September 2019,"I've just read about Stalin and his Terror, beginning in 1933 and lasting until his death. No one was safe, absolutely no one. As such the period is ripe for a movie about his death, particularly as he took a full 7 hours to die, and virtually no one had the courage to help him. This grand irony is given full measure in this production The Death of Stalin, and much, much more besides. We are given a clear picture of what the Terror meant for ordinary citizens, and the unfathomable character of affected people of those times. It's a black comedy with a sharp and difficult script for the actors, but thankfully they do a great job. Certainly not the funniest movie of all time (I only laughed once), nor the most brilliant historical piece (a lot of the characterisations involve persons far better looking, or inaccurate looking), but, for me, it was a blast to see history, accurate history, so well scrutinised. I so wish there were more films that do this. Wonderful, and important, entertainment.",The Death of Stalin
48,davidmvining,"These people were really awful, weren't they?",10,5 May 2020,"I was expecting a much more straight comedy based on the movie's marketing than what I got, but while the movie is often uproariously funny, it's still the story of a handful of awful people fighting to the death for control of the living corpse that was Soviet Russia. The comedy is there, not for no reason, but because it helps highlight the absolute absurdity of the overall situation but it also brings to the fore the strong personalities involved.Like most Russian literature, I have trouble keeping Russian names straight in The Death of Stalin. I remember that in Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment that there are two main characters whose names start with R, but one has a k somewhere in the middle while the other looks flat from the second letter on. That's how I kept those characters straight while reading, and I kind of had a similar experience while watching this. Other than a handful of names (Stalin, Molotov, and Khrushchev) I was lost in a sea of syllables I couldn't recall, so the use of both well known and easily distinctive actors was a very good idea, helping me get used to names to place with easily identifiable faces rather quickly.We also spent a lot more time with Stalin than I was expecting. Based on the trailers, I estimated that Stalin died within the first five minutes and the rest of the movie was vulgar bickering between the Politburo with no clear path forward. Those trailers were incredibly deceptive, but in a way that I really appreciate. What the trailers hid was a rather intelligent synthesis of the events at the highest levels of Soviet power in the first moments of post-Stalin Russia. In order to sell that, though, the movie needed to sell the final days of Stalin ruled Russia, and it does that very well with a view of a Stalinist purge being carried out alongside the camaraderie between the main players in the upcoming drama (Molotov, Khrushchev, Beria, and Malenkov) where we can sense the hidden animosities buried just underneath the surface.The confusion and forced mourning over Comrade Stalin's death very quickly gives way to politicking and scheming, especially on the parts of Khrushchev and Beria, while Malenkov has the power of Stalin awkwardly placed upon him, a man unequal to the task of handling the Politburo full of schemers. It's a war of words and whispers that breaks out as both Khrushchev and Beria work to undermine the other, both assuming (rather rightly) that Malenkov is simply too weak for the position. In the middle is Molotov, whose wife Beria returns after several years of punishment for sedition (either very clear or unproven depending on who's listening) while he feels more inclined to support to more reform minded Khrushchev.The movie is at it's funniest when people are insulting each other. My favorite is when Stalin's son Vasily yells at one of the doctors brought in to examine his father that he is mostly made of hair, but, in terms of laugh per aggressive sneer, it's Jason Isaacs as General Zhukov that takes the cake. He's wonderfully entertaining as he Yorkshire growls through every insult in every direction while cheerily joining Khrushchev against Beria because Beria undermined Zhukov's authority as his first act after Stalin's death.As with all movies based on history, I assume this is about 90% ahistorical, but The Death of Stalin, seems to capture the truth of the moment really well. It's a complete power vacuum as the central authority dies. There are protocols in place to try and smooth over the transition of power, but it's obvious from the start that the protocol will mean nothing when faced with the reality of power in the Soviet Union. The only thing keeping the letter of the law remotely alive (as excerpted in title cards throughout the film) is the memory of the fallen leader. It's a pretext for civility that hardly masks the incivility that guides every player's actions.Another smaller thing that the film does really well is capture the absolute terror of simply living in the Soviet Union. Molotov (played wonderfully by Michael Palin) cheerfully denounces his wife as worthy of her punishment in front of her because saying otherwise could send him to the gulag. The director of the radio program that transmits the Moscow's philharmonic completely recreates a performance because Stalin called and asked for a recording (after the performance ended) and he hadn't recorded it. And, the most simple and elegant example, the guards outside of Stalin's room refuse to check on their dear leader after the obvious sound of a falling body because to disturb Stalin while sleeping meant death.This is some of the most entertaining history, especially history that is so cruel and hideous, I've seen in a long while. Wonderfully acted, consistently funny, and alternately terrifying, The Death of Stalin is a marvelous look into a pocket of history with world shaping results.",The Death of Stalin

(R)""In the Loop"" director Iannucci delivers another brilliantly incisive satire in the political realm, this time dealing with the frantic, backstabbing power-grab in the Soviet Union after the sudden death of Joseph Stalin (McLoughlin). A skillful balance between the hysterical and horrific, sometimes separate and sometimes overlapping. Cast is pitch-perfect, finding just the right tone for the jet-black comedy by playing it straight-faced and anxious, but never fully sober; Tambor's pathetic and vain Georgy Malenkov and Isaacs' blunt and pompously aggressive Marshal Zhukov stand out, but there are no slackers (and it's a treat to see Palin onscreen again). Won't be for all tastes, especially those who have delicate sensibilities or are sticklers for historical accuracy, but it's not for nothing that Iannucci (and co-writers Ian Martin and David Schneider) often had to tone down the irrational insanity of the actual characters and situations so that it wouldn't seem so unbelievable.

The standout's are Isaacs' Yorkshire Field Marshall, and Russell Beale's creepy, comic turn.The jokes, though, begin to seem increasingly incongruous as we realise how many people have actually died and are continuing to die.

In this way, it works well much of the time. Stalin's upper tier seems to have been filled with yes-men whose apparent cowardice hides devious ambition beneath. Their pitiful lack of character make them easy fodder for mockery and there are, indeed, some genuine laughs.The trouble is in how the film handles the atrocious government-enforced murders, tortures, and incarcerations of numerous innocent citizens during the disreputable Stalin era. At best, the purges are trivialized. At worst, they are used as comic fodder. (""Well, you purged more people than I did."" ""Did not."")This element of bad taste separates me from the many who have praised ""The Death of Stalin"" as much as it did for ""Life is Beautiful"" (1997 - Italy), a comedy that used the Holocaust as a backdrop.""The Death of Stalin"" is a Belgian-French-UK co-production in the English language.

57,maurice_yacowar,Profane exposure of betrayals and false patriotism in government,8,29 March 2018,"The title and plot stress the death of Stalin but the film's primary thrust is the birth of another tyranny. The dictator gives way to the oligarchy. 
 This film takes Stalin as a starting point to reflect upon the current advent of the community of obscenely wealthy exploiters of government office, world wide. As democracy retreats, the oligarchs advance. 
 As in his earlier film In the Loop and the successful TV series he wrote, Veep, director Armando Iannucci plays a political drama for very broad satire and even broader, wildly inventive profanity. High drama plays out with astonishingly venal characters. Ideals are just something to violate. 
 The film is probably accurate in its depiction of scurrilous backstabbing and manoeuvring for position in the wake of Stalin's death. 
 But Iannucci is not interested in the narrow details of that history. His real subject is the mechanics of unprincipled politics, specifically how naked self-service betrays all principle under the false pretence of patriotism. 
 That's why none off the characters make even an attempt at a Russian accent. Iannucci wants the drama to reflect Western society not just Russia.
 The two lead Americans, Jeffrey Tambor and Steve Buscemi, play variations on their familiar roles - the pathetically insecure arrogant and the sour, playful killer, respectively. 
 The rest of the cast is British, as are the film's general irreverence, farcical pace and knockabout comedy. Iannucci doesn't even try to make this seem Russian. The Russian specific points out to every other world government that uses patriotism as the lipstick on its pig hunger for power.
 The film shows more cruelty than a farce normally does. At first, the torture, assassination and mass arrests play around the margin of the action. Beria's proclivity towards rape is tossed off by his telling a guard to bring in a mattress and to wash the girl. But his sadistic murder moves the inhumanity of the dictatorship to centre stage. 
 The frightened guard speaks for all soldiers too scared to get involved in anything: ""Should you shut the fuck up before you get us both killed?"" The medal-heavy Marshall Zhukov speaks for all arrogant generals: ""Right, what's a war hero got to do to get some lubrication around here?"" 
 This Khruschev actually steals a line from The Sopranos. When Stalin's son says he wants to speak at the funeral Khruschev responds sarcastically ""And I want to fuck Grace Kelly."" Uncle Junior's choice was Angie Dickenson. Smarter. 
 As in so much of the world today political disappearance and worse are a constant threat. Stalin has eliminated all the good doctors, for fear of them poisoning him. When the conductor orders the symphony to stay, to repeat their performance, he has to assure them: ""Don't worry, nobody's gonna get killed, I promise you. This is just a musical emergency!""
 So too Stalin's son's vehement demand on his fumbling national hockey team: ""Come on, play! Play better!"" Zhukov's medals evoke Kim Jong-un's and his generals' blinding arrays, or Trump's glittering array of bankruptcies and lawsuits. Similarly, Andreytev reports getting a call from ""The Secretariat of the General Secretariat. Of the General Secretary. The Secretary of the General...."" Politics is a layering of empty authorities, pretending to values and significance. 
 The chaos in this Kremlin tempts us to read it as a funhouse reflection upon Trump's White House. That certainly works. But the film - and its source comic book - must have been in the works before Trump's presidency was known for its disorder, corruption and incompetence. 
 If it has proved prophetic, it's because Iannucci realized that such oligarchic dictatorship is not unique to post-Stalin Mother Russia but a world-wife phenomenon. You can find it in Putin's Russia, North Korea, Syria, China, Trump's ambition, indeed wherever patriotism proves the last refuge of the greedy tyrant.",The Death of Stalin

60,dave-mcclain,"clever and insightful, but not as funny as it tries to be",4,19 March 2018,"""The Death of Stalin"" (R, 1:46) is a British political satire comedy, co-written and directed by Armando Iannucci, based on a French graphic novel, about the events leading up to, surrounding and immediately following the 1953 demise of Joseph Stalin, the long-time leader of the U.S.S.R. You might well wonder whether the violence of the Soviet dictator's regime would be appropriate fodder for a comedy film, or whether such a comedy could even work. Fair questions and, after watching this film, I'd say valid ones.The film opens with a dinner party thrown by Stalin (Adrian McLoughlin) and attended by his inner circle of Nikita Khrushchev and Georgy Malenkov (Golden Globe and Emmy winners Steve Buscemi and Jeffrey Tambor), Lavrentiy Beria (Simon Russell Beale) and Vyacheslav Molotov (Monty Python veteran Michael Palin). During that gathering, Stalin causes a minor panic by in a concert hall by personally asking for a recorded copy of that night's performance, and panic also comes to various individuals around Moscow as Stalin's security forces go after those on his most recent enemies list, as published by Beria. All of this tells us a lot about the main characters and Stalin's regime and nicely sets the stage for what is to come.The rest of the movie concerns itself with the titular event and its aftermath, focusing on the comical inefficiency of the Soviet regime and backstabbing among its high-ranking officials. After the aforementioned dinner party, after Stalin reads some hate mail sent to him by an idealistic and gutsy musician (Olga Kurylenko), then has a medical episode and collapses. Over the next 12 hours or so, Stalin's personal security detail, various government officials and a motley crew of doctors who are eventually called, all bungle their responses and Stalin dies. Then Stalin's children, a naïve drama queen (Andrea Riseborough) and an unhinged alcoholic (Emmy nominee Rupert Friend) show up, adding to the mayhem, followed quickly by the self-important Soviet Army chief, Field Marshall Zhukov (Jason Isaacs). Meanwhile, the men in the dead dictator's inner circle jockey for power and scheme against each other.""The Death of Stalin"" is clever, but not as funny as it wants to be. The movie tries to walk the fine line between taking the events it depicts somewhat seriously and showing the ridiculousness of the Soviet system in the early-mid 1950s and the men who ran it. The film walks that line well, but in doing so, fails to be very entertaining. The tragic historical facts of Stalin's murderous regime and the way its inefficiency fueled the Cold War with the United States makes the jokes less funny, but the nods to the seriousness of those situations keep the jokes from going far enough to be funnier. Despite the excellent cast, that middle-of-the-road approach to making a comedy about Stalin's death results in a middle-of-the-road grade from me, teetering on the edge of whether to recommend this movie or not... but barely coming down on the side of not. ""C+""",The Death of Stalin
61,bob-the-movie-man,Death. Torture. Child Abuse.  LOL??,8,13 October 2017,"Armando Iannucci is most familiar to TV audiences on both sides of the pond for his cutting political satire of the likes of ""Veep"" and ""The Thick of It"", with his only previous foray into directing movies being ""In the Loop"":  a spin-off of the latter series.  Lovers of his work will know that he sails very close to the wind on many occasions, such that  watching can be more of a squirm-fest than enjoyment.It should come as no surprise then that his new film – ""The Death of Stalin"" – follows that same pattern, but transposed into the anarchic and violent world of 1950's Russia. Based on a French comic strip, the film tells the farcical goings on surrounding the last days of the great dictator in 1953. Stalin keeps distributing his ""lists"" of undesirables, most of who will meet unpleasant ends before the end of the night. But as Stalin suddenly shuffles off his mortal coil, the race is on among his fellow commissariat members as to who will ultimately succeed him. The constitution dictates that Georgy Malenkov (an excellently vain and vacillating Jeffrey Tambor) secedes but, as a weak man, the job is clearly soon going to become vacant again and spy- chief Lavrentiy Beria (Simon Russell Beale) and Nikita Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi) are jostling for position.  (No spoilers, but you'll never guess who wins!).  Colleagues including Molotov (Michael Palin) and Mikoyan (Paul Whitehouse) need to decide who to side with as the machinations around Stalin's funeral become more and more desperate.The film starts extremely strongly with the ever-excellent Paddy Considine (""Pride"") playing a Radio Russia producer tasked with recording a classical concert, featuring piano virtuoso Maria Yudina (Olga Kurylenko, ""Quantum of Solace""). A definition of paranoia in action! We then descend into the chaos of Stalin's Russia, with mass torture and execution colouring the comedy from dark-grey to charcoal- black in turns. There is definitely comedy gold in there:  Khrushchev's translation of his drunken scribblings from the night before (of things that Stalin found funny and - more importantly - things he didn't) being a high point for me. Stalin's children Svetlana (Andrea Riseborough, ""Nocturnal Animals"") and Vasily (Rupert Friend, ""Homeland"") add knockabout humour to offset the darker elements, and army chief Georgy Zhukov (Jason Isaacs, ""Harry Potter"") is a riot with a no-nonsense North-of-England accent. The film held my interest throughout, but the comedy is just so dark in places it leaves you on edge throughout. The writing is also patchy at times, with some of the lines falling to the ground as heavily as the dispatched Gulag residents.It's not going to be for everyone, with significant violence and gruesome scenes, but go along with the black comic theme and this is a film that delivers rewards.(For the graphical review of the movie, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook. Thanks).",The Death of Stalin

65,Blue-Grotto,Stalin would be loving it!,10,28 October 2017,"Stalin would be loving it. In 1953 when he is found flat on his back and comatose, Stalin's corrupt, butt-kissing underlings cause chaos and terror with their plotting and scheming to replace him. Nightmares make more sense. Purges sweep away the unwise and unlucky, army and security forces vie for the upper hand, prison doors open and close, executions take place in broad daylight and back stabbing rules the day. This is political satire at its best.History, humor, brilliant quotes and somber visions about the past, present and future combine for a fantastic film. Truth is stranger than fiction, and one of the wonderful aspects of this film is how much the political trickery cuts to the bone. Vasily Stalin (the dictator's vodka guzzling son) gets on the podium, for instance, and military jets streak across the sky and drown out his speech. A planned distraction? Of course. Stunts like this could happen anywhere and are happening everywhere. The film rings true. It is an eye-opening and fabulous glimpse of the political underworld. This is how people get killed or locked away, when their stories don't fit. The actors are amazingly good, especially Jeffrey Tambor as Malenkov, Steve Buscemi as Khrushchev and Jason Isaacs as Zhukov. If you like politics and history as much as I do, you will love this. The film is in English and a variety of accents. This device (the various accents) heightens the aspect of chaos and confusion. Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival.",The Death of Stalin

68,Alexander_Blanchett,Political farce with a lot of bite,8,21 May 2018,"What a blast. Absolutely felt like a stage play. Such a wonderfully self ironic and satirical film wasnt seen in a long time in the past years. 
The screenplay is absolutely fantastic - and brave. Armando Iannucci was absolutely in his element when he brought together those dysfunctional characters that try to play each other out. A great political farce in the total sense of the word. The actors were brilliantly picked. Steve Buscemi is absolutely fantastic and the perfect choice for the role he plays. I really hope this works for him as a comeback because it is really a loss for cinema not seeing him in those kind of roles anymore.
Simon Russell Beale was fantastic and unlike most things he has done before. Absolutely hilarious in a way and disgusting in another. Michael Palin's casting absolutely perfect. He fits in this film like no other, mostly because I thought there were many Monty Python references, also you could say that this could easily be a Monty Python feature. 
Good support by Paddy Considine and Andrea Riseborough. Jeffrey Tambor was the best besides Buscemi and really loved every time Jason Isaacs was on screen. A winner film with a lot of potential to become a satiric classic.",The Death of Stalin

The dialogue is hysterically delivered without even the hint of a Russian accent and the whole thing has an air of farce, but one surrounded with firing squads, power struggles and gulags. Only Simon Russel Beale as Beria really terrifies, with back stabbing, double crossing and a plot as twisted as the deceptions on screen, but really it's Jason Issacs that steals the show, his entrance and performance is nothing short of majestic!

The uncanny valley vibe is strong here as Stalin's Russia comes alive with myriad British and America character actors but you settle into it and the queasy waltz of blunt death and prattish behavior is intoxicating. It may be almost entirely false but the ludicrous scramble of terrible men to have all the power whilst simultaneously being unwilling to accept any responsibility for it has a hard ring of truth to it.

It had good comedic moments, mostly in the first half, but I wouldn't call it a funny movie, and feel like the humor didn't really land with me the way it clearly did with many. It is an effective satire of the dictatorial Soviet state, with everyone scrambling for political favor any way possible. I liked Buscemi a lot, and Tambor was also good. Ultimately, the story just never drew me in. As the movie wore on, it wasn't as funny and was a mediocre story of a few people fighting for political support. It did a good job of capturing the political silliness of the Soviet state, but didn't do anything else interesting, making for a very average movie.",The Death of Stalin
73,PyroSikTh,"The Thick of It, but in Soviet Russia",8,19 April 2018,"The Death of Stalin has all of Iannucci's hallmarks of both dark comedy and political satire weaved through an otherwise quite serious story. Stalin is dead (spoilers), and the vacuum of power he leaves behind is ripe for the taking. But Russian authority doesn't work the same as it does anywhere else. It's crueller and less forgiving, and as such Iannucci has an entire playground of backstabbing and scheming characters to work with. He's able to twist fear and paranoia into pure humour and hilarity.The film opens with a mysterious phone call from Stalin's staff to a radio station, and the utter dread and confusion it instills in those that work at the radio station is equal parts hilarious and terrifying. After this introduction, we kick off with Stalin's council dividing and scheming behind each others backs. Death camp lists are drawn and redrawn, Stalin's children are manipulated and moved like pawns on a chessboard, and Stalin's own estate and staff are stripped and discarded like waste. And yet amidst the bleak cruelty and the cast of immensely dislikable characters, jokes are found fast and often, poking fun at it all and ultimately painting everyone involved as an idiot. Malenkov is a spineless coward, Molotov is so paranoid of retribution that he continues to lambast his wife after she's found innocent of treason, Mikoyan and Bulganin pretty much just go along with whoever shouts the loudest, Khrushchev can't seem to see any of his plans to success, Zhukov is just the muscle that doesn't give a crap, and Vasily is so drunk all the time that he doesn't even know what he's saying.The humour here is almost always black, even if just by virtue of being humour interspersed in a dark, violent story full of executions, death camps, and political intrigue. But beyond that, some of the jokes are just inherently black by nature, such as Molotov talking about his wife's treason for instance, or guards refusing to check on Stalin through fear of being killed. Many of the jokes find lighter footing though, such as Zhukov teasing Khrushchev when approached with helping to take down Beria, or Vasily attempting to wrestle a gun from his bodyguard while everyone else just stands there watching with bored or unimpressed expressions, or even the council consistently kneeling in a puddle of piss.And yet the humour never undermines it's more serious moments. There's barely a joke to be found in the film's final scenes when all the scheming pays off and a new regime is founded, sequences of people being rounded up and sent for torture or execution is as bleak as it sounds, and the closing credits are almost haunting in their mirroring of Russian treatment of history.As such all the actors involve do a great job of tackling both the dramatic and comedic aspects of their roles. Jason Isaacs is undoubtedly the standout when it comes to humour, utilising a Yorkshire accent to really give Zhukov the carefree attitude that makes him so entertaining. Simon Russell Beale on the other hand gives us a properly conniving villain who's repulsive to the core. He makes Beria oh so easy to hate. Michael Palin, Steve Buscemi, and Jeffrey Tambor manage to straddle the careful tightrope between likeable enough to laugh at, but unlikeable enough to befit their characters. If I had to pick a weak link it would probably be Andrea Riseborough, but I kind of feel that's unfair as I'm not a fan of her as it is. I found her Svetlana more of an annoyance than anything. Even Olga Kurylenko offered a performance more interesting and engaging.The Death of Stalin was pretty much exactly what I wanted. It finds humour in all the best places, and fills the movie to the brim with quotable lines and memorable moments that'll have me chuckling to myself for weeks. At the same time it doesn't shy away from it's dark subject matter, using it as framing for the idiocy the film pokes at. It pretty much is The Thick of It, but in Soviet Russia. If there's one thing that didn't quite work for me, it's how little flow there is between the light and the dark. Three Billboards did the serious/humourous really well, changing with the click of the fingers in the middle of its scenes, but The Death of Stalin gives you scenes gut-wrenching and horrible to contemplate, and then expects you to laugh in the next scene. It's not a big criticism, but I felt the balance could've been a little better. Regardless, I give the movie a solid 8/10, and would recommend it to any fans of political satire or black comedy (or both, I guess).",The Death of Stalin

I had heard about this movie from it's BAFTA nominations and it's critical praise. Krista and I were about to see Book Club but then we changed our minds at the very last second (5 minutes before the movie started and drove to the campus theater). We both agreed that it was a pretty good movie. The performances were amazing. My favorites were Steve Buscemi, Jeffrey Tambor, and Andrea Riseborough. The score was beautiful. It was all classical and sounded like Russian concertos and other symphonies. I liked the cinematography. It had a little bit of a grainy look and the highlights were green. You wouldn't think this movie would be a comedy, but it has got to be one of the best comedies I have seen in recent years. It was dark and hilarious. It reminded me of a cartoon. I liked the editing for the movie. Between tone changes there were quotes from what I could only assume was there constitution during the time of the Soviets. It also had topics about what was to come. The only problem that I really had was it could be wordy at times, it was hard to keep up with the names, and there was only one part that dragged. I don't want to say much about it because I went into the movie blind. I knew it was supposed to be a comedy and what the movie dealt with.

78,CineMuseFilms,a deviously clever satire on Russian politics that is relevant elsewhere,8,16 April 2018,"Political satires are a devious genre for many reasons. They use black comedy to mock their subject but are not always clear about who or what that subject may be. The devilishly dark British-American-French film The Death of Stalin (2017) is ostensibly about the 1953 demise of one of the world's cruellest despots, Joseph Stalin. But when you look closely, you find unmistakable parallels with despots elsewhereThe film quickly shows a Stalinist Russia that is ruled by fear, where no Moscow apparatchik can be sure of living to the end of any day. Having jailed or killed the nation's best doctors, Stalin's stroke is pure karma. His bodyguards outside hear the mighty ruler crash to the floor but were commanded not to interrupt him under any circumstance. As he lay in a puddle of his own urine for several hours, his Central Committee henchmen enter the office one by one to profess their devotion but do nothing. As the tyrants-in-waiting Beria, Malenkov, Khrushchev, Zhukov, and Molotov join the gathering, it is clear that nobody wants Stalin to survive but all are terrified he might live to take it out on them.As Stalin fades away, the jockeying for succession between the aspiring leaders escalates. Nobody trusts anybody, and everybody conspires to eliminate the others. Meanwhile, the population begins compulsory mourning and civil unrest is quelled with mass shootings. By the time of Stalin's funeral, Committee members have plotted and double-crossed each other so many times that nobody knows who will survive. Fake news and information leaks by conspirators are used to frame multiple assassination plots until Khrushchev is the last man standing. As he assumes the role of Russia's Supreme Leader, he is watched from the wings by the up and coming Brezhnev who will soon take his place.All of this sounds like well-documented Russian history, so how is it a comedy? There is a delicious irony in the meticulously constructed and authentic-looking mid-1950s palatial Russian settings and the cast of actors with outrageously exaggerated British, Irish, Scottish and Welsh accents. The intelligently funny one-liners are delivered with forensic timing to portray Russian politics as stranger than fiction. It is no wonder that the film is banned in modern Russia; the callous disregard for human life and the incoherently ridiculous maneuvering for the top job speaks volumes for the way Russia's political process operates. If this is not enough to crack you up, a more sombre insight is that the petty posturing and chaotic decision-making looks contemporary.Students of Russian history may wince at the disrespect shown for an historical era in which so much carnage can be traced directly to Stalin or the suggestion that the Stalin-Khrushchev-Brezhnev triumvirate has transitioned to the Putin era. But this is not a film for serious political discourse; rather it is a lampooning of the political culture existing in many nations that, some may say, has echoes in today's America.",The Death of Stalin
79,TaylorYee94,Such a bliss to watch and learn even after the movie.,8,15 September 2021,"Political Satire is very tricky genre. Most political situation and facts are serious and intense, and the adaptation of any version of history should be at least loosely based on the truth. Among all these, adding humor at the same time and at the right time is profoundly hard. 'The Death of Stalin' manages to succeed in bring out laughter in the most cruel and confused time in Soviet Union.First, topic is original. Not many movies talk about what actually happened in Soviet Union history. It is often used as a tool or a background, an enemy or villainous side during the Cold War to stand up against an American hero. The film pretty accurately describes the political aftermath of Stalin's death such as power struggle, killing or being killed, and cover-ups for past corruption. I cannot believe this much dynamic side of history is never dealt with or delved into while there are redundant stories on World War almost every year.Second, screenwriting is exceptional. Scriptwriters set the characters with distinction. Each one has own personality, ambition, and interests. Their personal and political relationship is portrayed clearly and precisely. There is no leap of logic, and it keeps tension for audience to follow what is happening and will happen like a well-knitted sweater. The plot piles up neatly and no superfluousness. Just a pleasure to watch.",The Death of Stalin
80,david-meldrum,When is comedy inappropriate? A style of comedy that's an acquired taste; if your taste runs in darker hues you'll enjoy this,8,24 February 2019,"How soon is too soon? Are there such things as subjects about which jokes should never be made?These are the questions that echo unavoidably in the mind long after the credits of The Death Of Stalin roll. Directed and written by Armando Iannucci, the British mind behind some of the best television satire over the last few years (most notably The Thick Of It and Veep), this film sees him bringing his observational, fly on the wall style of film-making to historical events as we observe the merciless behind the scenes jockeying for power in the wake of Satlin's death. The cast is a vast array of comic talent, and they're at their very best; Iannucci's style demands a lot of his actors, and they all rise to the challenge admirably. They wring every last moment of physical and verbal humour out of the script - make no mistake, you will laugh a lot during this film.But the appropriateness questions won't go away, These are events around which a lot of people died; and these are people who didn't care who suffered in the rush to power. Iannucci's thinking is in the deepest original satirical traditions - mock the devil, and he has no power left. It's also true that most of the darkness that is in the film is played straight; a counterpoint to the absurdity of surrounding events.It would be too simplistic, though, to suggest that this film doesn't have serious things to say, Most intelligent comedy has a lot to say - and Iannucci is nothing if not intelligent. The moment that's portrayed as leading to Stalin's death from a stroke is his mocking shock at a note smuggled to him, from the relative of a victim of one of his purges, promising revenge and 'praying for his death'. Iannucci wants to be on the side of the angels here, showing the suffering as getting some measure of justice.My own inclination has always been to say that there's nothing about which, in theory at least, a joke can't or shouldn't be made. What matters is context, content and intention. Here Iannucci seems to be satirising the amoral political power-grabs of people who care little for the consequences - a truth which is unavoidable in many a Westernised democracy in these days, the same Western democracies which have often been so quick to take the moral high ground over the Russian systems. For me this is a clever, funny, skilful film that only suffers slightly from a running time on the generous side. It put in me mind of writers like Aaron Sorkin, who slip moments of physical and wordplay comedy in to serious political situations; life is rarely all tragic or all comic. I told jokes in my eulogy at my father's funeral; the very best funerals in my professional experience of taking many of them, allow time for laughter as well as tears. But Iannucci's comedy is an acquired taste, and some won't be able to or want to stomach it. And that's fine; but if your tastes in comedy run a bit darker, then you'll find much to enjoy in this skilful and deft film.",The Death of Stalin

83,dr_clarke_2,Depicts the terrors of Stalinist Russia whilst mercilessly lampooning it at the same time,9,12 October 2021,"The Death of Stalin is the second feature film directed by Scottish satirist and writer Armando Iannucci, a man well known to fans of British television comedy as the co-creator of Alan Partridge and the creator of sitcom The Thick of It (and its film spin-off In the Loop, Iannucci's directorial feature debut). The Death of Stalin treads much darker waters that Iannucci's previous work, concerning as it does the brutal, bloody and ruthless power struggle between the members of the Soviet Union's Cabinet of Ministers following the incapacitation and subsequent death of Joseph Stalin. But whilst the subject matter may be deadly serious, it turns out that Iannucci still isn't...
The Death of Stalin is a riotously funny black comedy that doesn't shy away from such matters as state executions, sexual abuse of prisoners, and the massacre of innocents, but somehow manages to leave the audience doubled up with laughter at its depiction of the mechanics of how these things come to be allowed, or indeed to happen at all. Iannucci co-wrote the screenplay with David Schneider and Ian Martin based on the graphic novels La Mort de Staline by Fabien Nury and Thierry Robin, and they managed to depict the terrors of Stalinist Russia whilst mercilessly lampooning it at the same time. From monstrous NKVD chief Beria casually giving orders about how to execute Stalin's enemies with an air of bored officiousness, to panic-stricken conductor Andreyev urgently arranging a repeat performance of a live concerto when Stalin phones up after it has finished to ""request"" a recording, the overall picture is of tyranny, bureaucracy, incompetence and scheming.If the film seems in poor taste, it gets away with it for the simple reason that it is largely a true story and demonstrates just how much evil can be orchestrated - sometimes accidentally - by the ambitions, self-interest and self-preservation of greedy, opportunistic men. Stalin's reign of terror disintegrates when he dies, but any relief is tempered by his subordinates frantic desire to fill as much of the resulting power vacuum as possible. Few politicians have ever been as venal as these; one of the single most insightful scenes is the meeting of the council following Stalin's death, which is a masterpiece of self-justification, self-aggrandisement and double-speak.Iannucci demonstrates a solid grasp of mise-en-scéne, convincingly recreating the period setting through a combination of location filming (in Kyiv and London), and whilst his directing style is informed more by television than cinema, he does an impressive job, with some great camerawork and lots of creative flourishes, such as the use of on screen titles to introduce the various characters. Christopher Willis' score pays homage to Dmitri Shostakovich, or at least the music that Shostakovich was forced to write under Stalin, and is perfectly suited to the gloomy pomposity of the era depicted.But the masterstroke is the casting: wisely eschewing the idea of having the British and American actors adopt Russian accents, he lets a first-rate cast led by Steve Buscemi as Khrushchev and a show-stealing Simon Russell Beale as Lavrenti Beria make the real-life characters they play their own. Letting English actor Adrian McLoughlin play Stalin with a thick London accent sounds like a silly idea, but it works brilliantly; likewise, Jason Isaacs' down-to-Earth portrayal of Georgy Zhukov as a gruff Yorkshireman is similarly inspired, as is Paul Whitehouse's no-nonsense, plain-speaking take on Anastas Mikoyan. Michael Palin's bumbling Molotov, who changes his opinion at the slightest suggestion, is hilarious, as is Rupert Friend as the drunken, insane Vasily. In the midst of a cast of mostly middle aged men, Andrea Riseborough gives a superb performance as Stalin's daughter Svetlana.The Death of Stalin was banned in Russia, allegedly for mocking its past. Exactly how accurate the film's depiction of events is might be questionable, but I strongly suspect that the level of back-stabbing corruption and self-interest of the members of Stalin's inner circle is, if anything, underestimated. One thing seems certain: nobody involved in these events is likely to have found them remotely amusing.

86,gavinp9,Enjoyable historical/political satire.,6,2 April 2018,"'The Death of Stalin' is a satirical look at 1950's USSR (from the director of 'In The Loop' a hilarious look at British politics, who's also the creator of 'Veep'). This is similar to 'In The Loop', if not quite as good, with mostly British actors playing Russians and not changing their accents, making for a refreshing and playful tone. Even though the majority are British - including Beria (Russell Beale), Molotov (Palin), Zhuov (Isaacs) & Stalin (McLoughlin) - two of the main actors are American: Krushchev (Buscemi) and Malenkov (Tambor).The film is basically about Beria, head of NKVD (Internal Affairs) and Krushchev, First Secretary, scheming and plotting to run Russia after Stalin dies - even though it's technically Malenkov, who's basically a puppet. There's plenty of fun digs at how inept the Soviets were, but also some commentary on how bad things were during the Cold War. Main problem with the film is the lack of backstory - obviously based somewhat on facts, but a lot of creative license taken - but things happen so fast that it takes a while to figure out who's who, etc.There's a few laughs, but no real hilarious moments, expect maybe when Buscemi tries to swap places with Tambor. There's plenty to like, and all the actors are good, especially Buscemi, Kurylenko and Russell Beale - and always good to see a Python on screen with Palin. However, I felt it lacked something to make it a truly great comedy.",The Death of Stalin

88,Donatien3,Entertaining Political Satire,10,26 May 2019,"Director and writer Armando Iannucci is famous for brilliant political satire shows 'VEEP' and 'The Thick of It'.It's no surprise that 'The Death of Stalin' is just as good as those two shows.After Stalin's unexpected death, the power play between the Council of Ministers begins. It gets very sweary, occasionally violent (a lot of people get shot in the head due to Stalin's lists) and is a lot of fun. The back-and-forth between the council could be its own long-form series, allowing the political intrigue and satire to really be explored. As Stalin isn't in this movie very long, he's treated as a revered, almost mythical figure, to be respected and feared.There's a great cast, including Jeffrey Tambor, Steve Buscemi, Michael Palin, and Jason Isaacs. The actors keep their native accents. It's a good move as it allows the dialogue to flow naturally rather than be distracted by dodgy Russian accents.If you love political satire, 'The Death of Stalin' is a must watch.",The Death of Stalin

The things that were happening in the background while comedy was ongoing was nothing short of remarkable..how can something be funny AND horrendous at the same time?Brilliant in the most basic form of film making...with outstanding performances all around..also it shows up in a tiny way what it must have been like to have to review every word before it left your lips.For me Jason Isaccs steals it as a Yorkshire Russian with a thirst for action..Fantastic.Alas this will be nowhere to be seen at the awards but get this on the big screen where it belongs..give the ""biggies"" a rest this week and grab a proper piece of film making!",The Death of Stalin

I saw one trailer for this which led to me to think this might be a film worth watching, yet the first twenty minutes or so made me think I had made a terrible mistake, it was fairly boring to be honest' but I stuck with it and what developed was quite a passable film filled with humour and drama Andean not short of stars. The time is just before the death of Stalin and then the chaos that follows. The film depicts the power struggles that took place after his death. I have little to no knowledge of Russian History but that did not make any difference, I only recognised one or two of the Russian names but knowing that actors made it perfectly easy to follow the plot. I had a sense of watching Monty Python, which was cemented by the arrival of Michael Palin on the screen. It was very clever not to use Russian accents throughout, in fact this added to the comedic value.

91,ginocox-206-336968,An unintentionally damning indictment of liberal social politics,4,21 February 2018,"""The Death of Stalin"" is strangely, and doubtless unintentionally, evocative of our current political climate, in which seemingly innocuous and well-intended comments or efforts at humor are twisted and misconstrued as damning evidence of lack of conformity to political correctitude. Everybody is circumspect about every word they utter. Highly respected individuals who have worked tirelessly their entire careers are disgraced by unfounded allegations of impropriety. Liberal ideals are corrupted to advance the goals of disparate political factions. Everybody is terrified that any misstatement will be recorded and turned against them. People spend more time apologizing and clarifying than actually communicating fresh ideas. People embrace political dogma out of fear, not conviction. Close allies can turn into vicious opponents at the slightest scent of weakness or political unorthodoxy. TDoS is a black comedy. The humor is subtle, but incisive. Performances are good. Production values are adequate, although the film suffers from over-reliance on kinetosis-inducing jiggly-cam shots and the British accents of Russian characters is distracting.",The Death of Stalin
92,kaptenvideo-89875,"Power games after Stalin's death, and some of your favourite actors on screen. Worth seeing!",7,4 February 2018,"Armando Iannucci is widely acclaimed for his political satire comedies (""The Thick of It"", ""Veep"", ""In the Loop"") but here comes the project that might just become his first magnum opus.Chances are that even if one is not interested in politics, one is at least a bit intrigued by the dark comedy about the notorious Soviet leader's death and power struggles that followed it.Every big player in the vicinity, of course, wants a piece of the pie, including Khrushchev (played by Steve Buscemi), Beria (Simon Russell Beale), Malenkov (Jeffrey Tambor), Molotov (Michael Palin), and Tarasov (Richard Brake).Also appearing, Jason Isaacs, Olga Kurylenko, Paddy Considine, Adrian McLoughlin as the great papa Stalin himself, plus Rupert Friend and Andrea Riseborough as his drunkard son and hysterical daughter, respectively.You read it right, the movie has a bunch of talented actors at the height of their ""game"", re-enacting one of the most large-scale power wars in Soviet history.Not to mention a superb attention to historical detail which concentrates not only the Soviet glamour but how crumbly and shabby everything was behind the facades. What's not to like, eh?As expected of Iannucci, the style is theatrical - relatively small and closed sets, a lot of fast dialogue and not many events or setpieces to speak of - but the humor is sharp and you can't really get anything less than great performances out of the cast this awesome.To highlight some names, Isaacs is magnificent as the military leader, predatory and threatening as always in this kind of roles. Beale is superb as Beria, always out for blood and ready to bite, very playful, very mobile energy-wise. Tambor is doing his famous ""greedy but cowardly"" shtick, which I just love ever since first seeing that in ""The Larry Sanders Show""...There's only one reason that I have not rated this tasty piece of entertainment higher than 7. I liked it a lot but there's something to be said about Iannucci's breathless, tempo always up-to-eleven approach to storytelling which gets a bit exhausting in a piece that long.Fast tempo would probably work well for a shorter period of time, but I felt that 106 minutes is too long for endless sprint. It needs some calmer interludes to let the viewer breathe and let all the greatness sink in.Having said that, I want to find time to watch ""The Death of Stalin"" again in the near future, to reconsider its strengths and possible deficiencies. Because it feels like a movie that will grow on you.I'd watch any movie just to see Tambor, Buscemi and Isaacs on screen together. But speaking in general, this was one of the most praised ones released in 2017. Go see it. A rare piece of entertainment that makes you google the historical facts later, just to know more about the real story.",The Death of Stalin

95,politic1983,It's Just Word Play,7,27 November 2017,"""It's just f***ing word play"" - Nikita KhrushchevArmando Iannucci has spent much of his career predicting the political future: whether it's pre-empting overly bombastic news graphics with ""The Day Today""; foretelling leadership changes within UK politics in ""Time Trumpet""; and acting as a think-tank for any recent UK government with ""The Thick of It"". But probably bored of inadvertently directing the course of the UK, he now turns his art to the past. The Soviet past.As you may know, popular Georgian Joseph Stalin died in the mid- Twentieth Century. Frenchmen Fabien Nury and Thierry Robin made a graphic novel about said event. Then a group of British writers turned it into a film script. We all know the routine. Finding the urine- soaked body the next morning, his supporting cast, made-up of names you've already forgotten from GCSE history confusedly debate what to do about the situation, choosing to work as a collective.Malenkov (Jeffrey Tambor) is appointed Acting General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, but real power is hidden behind him, as a power struggle emerges between Beria (Simon Russell Beale) and Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi), as each try to manipulate the situation and get the support of the rest of the collective. This leads to lots of typical Iannucci fast dialogue and improvised banter in the workplace, as each actor brings a unique personality to their historical figure, such as Paul Whitehouse's cockney Mikoyan, Rupert Friend's drunken public schoolboy Vasily Stalin and Adrian McLoughlin's dirty old man Stalin himself. As with the likes of ""Blackadder"" before it, comedy is a good way of re-teaching history, placing historical fact in an accessible format. Buscemi's line as Khrushchev denotes the quick wit of the writers and cast, but also the very nature of politics and how it is all about what is said, and what is not said. Joking aside, the tricks become more underhanded and plotting more deceitful. To succeed, each must eliminate his opposition as quickly as possible; the more ruthless the better. Every act has a distinct purpose to it: to gain the upper hand. Though this being Soviet Russia, getting bumped-up the order on the news is not enough. The end takes a sinister twist as each is exposed for their previous and present crimes, with the victor the one able to vilify the other fastest. This is handled by the cast in a day-at-the-office manner; a stoic nature born when making decisions affecting the lives and deaths of others. While without the sinister undertones of endless death, today's political playground of every man for himself and acting before the next man still holds true. An observation on the basic human nature of power struggle and that all political hierarchies are doomed from the outset. GCSE History: B",The Death of Stalin
96,digdog-785-717538,A sort-of-good film that's really not for everyone,6,25 June 2019,"I thought this was going to be similar to The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, in it being a ""Art Film"", and in a sense it's not too distant. But i liked Scruggs - a little if not much - and didnt like Death of Stalin instead.There is good and bad about this film; you should know that this is a comedy, about, well, the death of Stalin. Specifically Stalin was a major A-hole and everyone around him lived in a climate of fear, but the reason why people were even around him in the first place is because they were all power-hungry maniacs in the first place; so, not really nice people.
And if you knew the history you would find this far, far more comical as it caricaturizes these otherwise fierce people.
The plot revolves around Stalin dropping #ded and everyone around him scrambles to make the best of a volatile situation, plotting murder, coups, or even just finding a way to stay alive in the oncoming political purges.Production-wise, they went with talented, known but not immediately recognizable actors, which is good. The only two i could immediately spot were Michael Palin and Steve Buscemi. The sets and historical recreations are on point. Photography is nice but nothing worth shouting about.Now, on to the bad.It failed to pull me in in any way. The plot doesn't flow, there are to many primary characters. There is no real protagonist either, which makes it ever so harder to follow.
And the worst problem is, that i do not know the characters. Now, i understand that this is my fault and not the film's, but the main source of ""fun"" is how each of these historical characters is portrayed. And, well i don't know about you, but im not terribly familiar with what sort of man Nikita Krushchev was, or Georgey Malenkov, so most of the satire is lost on me. And as a comedy, it's not really that funny.Nicely done film, but lacking in mainstream appeal. Unless you're in college and specifically studying this period of time, or have otherwise intimate knowledge of the post-stalinist period of soviet russia, i would say to give this a miss in favour of something designed for easier consumption.6.5/10",The Death of Stalin
97,asifahsankhan,Political savagery at its best!,8,29 July 2018,"Armando Iannucci has written and directed two films in his career, and they're both among the best political comedies ever made. First there was ""In the Loop,"" an extension of his British TV series ""The Thick of It"" (he also created HBO's ""Veep"") that used fictional U.K. and U.S. functionaries to satirize our two nations' political dysfunction and eagerness for war. Now he returns (with co-writers David Schneider and Ian Martin) with ""The Death of Stalin,"" a breathtakingly dark comedy of errors that holds up the brutal Soviet dictator's final days and their aftermath as a mirror to current British and American quagmires.The fictionalized plot, which hardly exaggerates the truth, comes from a French graphic novel; Iannucci and company have added comedy to it, replaying horrific events as farce, turning everyone into greedy bumblers vying to be Stalin's successor, finding grim laughs in the minutiae of his reign of terror. (""Don't worry!"" says the Radio Moscow director cheerily to the audience he's hastily assembling at Stalin's command. ""Nobody's going to get killed!"") When a not-yet-dead Stalin is lying unconscious on his office floor, everyone who enters the room inadvertently kneels in the same puddle of urine next to his body.The masterstroke, however, is in the casting, and in the decision to have everyone speak in their native accents. So here's Steve Buscemi as Nikita Khrushchev, a loud buffoon and sycophant who keeps track of which of his jokes get the best laughs; Jeffrey Tambor as Georgy Malenkov, Stalin's gullible deputy (he weeps hilariously at the sight of Dear Leader incapacitated) whose idiocy makes him useful; Simon Russell Beale as Lavrenti Beria, a Cheney-like opportunist; Michael Palin as Vyacheslav Molotov, a befuddled bureaucrat who was on Stalin's to-kill list; Jason Isaacs as Georgy Zhukov, swaggering military commander; Rupert Friend as Stalin's raving conspiracy-theorist son. Stalin himself is played by Adrian McLoughlin in a rough working-class British accent, coming across like a street thug who rose to the top of a crime syndicate.The few women who are present in all this - Stalin's daughter (Andrea Riseborough), an anti-Stalin concert pianist (Olga Kurylenko), Khrushchev's wife (Sylvestra Le Touzel), even down to Stalin's secretary (June Watson) - happen to be the only reasonable, mature people in the story. This may have been a conscious choice by the filmmakers to comment on male paranoia and competition, or it may just be historically accurate.True to form, Iannucci packs the dialogue with petty sniping and profane insults, cheerfully mining laughs from ghastly true events. It's the sort of movie where you kill a political enemy, set him on fire, and then yell obscenities at the burning corpse. (Incidentally, it's been ages since we saw Monty Python's Michael Palin on the big screen, and Iannucci's snarky-intellectual banter is a perfect fit for him.) But where Iannucci's past work has had a fly-on-the-wall documentary feel, ""The Death of Stalin"" is more elegantly cinematic, accompanied by classical music (Chopin, Mozart, and of course Tchaikovsky) on the soundtrack. He performs a delicate tight-rope act, conjuring thoughts of Brexit and Trump without laying it on too thick, and mocking political connivers of all stripes with eloquent savagery.",The Death of Stalin
98,bastos,Very good,7,27 August 2020,"Armando Iannucci brings his brand of humor to Stalin era Soviet Union. While he usually makes political comedies with fictitious events that mirror some of it's real world counterparts, here he makes a political comedy with real events that seem so far fetched they seem fictitious. It's kind of like when in a conversation you tell an uncomfortable truth but tell it as a joke and everybody laughs. That's the genius of this film, all that you see is either true or based on myths that nobody knows how true they are, but by making it a farce it all just seems so absurd that you can't help but laugh at all of this. Having said that I still prefer his earlier work, but this is still a very good effort worth checking out.",The Death of Stalin
99,eldreddsouza,There's a reason this film isn't popular.,2,5 June 2021,"How do you take a plot as interesting as this and make it so boring? Honestly I am so disappointed with this film that I cannot express how I feel. The screenplay is so poor and boring that I was bored to death and just hoping it would end stat. The acting was also mediocre and I found myself for the most part being annoyed rather than finding their antics, etc funny.I had somewhat high expectations as the film's plot seemed super interesting, but sadly the film ended up testing my patience. I finally finished it without skipping parts, but now I kinda wish I did since it would save me some time. Time that would have been put to better use. This is because there's absolutely nothing interesting later on in the film. I kept hoping for the interesting part to come on, but there just weren't any.I found only the start to be kinda okay, but it just went downhill from there. A friend recommended this to me and to him I would like to say, ""Buddy, your reco was pathetic. Won't be taking anymore from you in the future"" lol. Ahhh I'm so pissed haha.I barely laughed thrice during it's entire runtime. A 20 minute episode of The office gives you at least 20-30 times more laughs than this around 2 hr long film, literally.I watched it so that you don't have to.

100,cordenw,Consider yourself very lucky,10,5 March 2018,"That you weren't walking the halls of power in Uncle Joe's day.
One wrong look, one mistaken arched eyebrow, one accidental meeting with a lightly suspected enemy of The State and you were toast.Stalin was the figurehead of that particular Ship of State, where a murderous communist bureaucracy just grew out of the ashes of the murderous Tsarist bureaucracy. You can't blame just Stalin himself for it all, it was a runaway train.This, though, is Russia's fate; intrigue, suspicion, doublecross and murder are baked into the DNA of the nation ( All nations have these problems, but the penalty for getting caught in Russia has a nasty finality to it.)And so what would you expect upon the death of leader who ran the country with a flawed ideological rule book, where death or exile was the punishment for any form of disagreement? Refer to the paragraph above and add in a bit of chaos!Well this film shows pretty much what happened and to my mind it's brilliantly portrayed.The members of the politbureau who stood in all their resplendent power on the balcony at Red Square proved, with one or two exceptions, that they were just Stalin's lackeys and hopelessly out of their depth when they actually had to make decisions for themselves. 
Steve Buscemi plays a wonderful part as Khrushchev who is portrayed as one of the stronger members of the schemers after the Boss dies.Simon Russell Beale is superb as Beria, the ultimate hatchet man for the system.Jason Isaacs as General Zhukov has the best part in the whole movie. A tough no-nonsense, do what's got to be done type of individual.I thought that Molotov was unfairly cast as a bit of a bumbler when real history shows that he was a mulish, ruthless messenger who would not give up a blade of grass in negotiations.All the rest of the cast do a fabulous job and I love the way they all have cockney type accents, especially Joe in the opening scenes.Of course there's two routes you can go with making a movie like this, one is to tell the story as the tragedy it was with all of the emotive Russian Music that's available. Or you can satirize it as the absolute travesty that it was. If you take the second option, you can poke fun at the ineptitude and blind obedience. Poke fun at any crazy interpretation of the concept of communism that happened to be in favour on any particular day. 
Interpretations that to most of today's enlightened minds are just ludicrous!I like Iannucci's approach to telling the story, with just the right amount of humour injected to take the real edge off what happened and yet educate us as to the horrible and easily repeatable reality.",The Death of Stalin

102,js-66130,QUIT STALIN,7,23 March 2018,"The death of a ruthless dictator is often followed by total chaos, usually not of the funny variety. Except here. Here it's quite funny.Too early? Shouldn't be after all this was 1953, but the atrocities of the Soviet state were indeed, quite brutal. Thus the fine line balancing act begins. Armando Iannucci has bitten deep into political farce with Veep, The Thick of It, and In The Loop, but this is on another level altogether. As the masses are being rounded up and flippantly disposed of, the heads of state quibble nonsensically over tedious issues whilst plotting their personal power trips. Portraying eventual successor (spoiler) Nikita Krushev, Steve Buscemi is fabulously frazzled and slyly devious, but it is the truly vitriolic performance of Simon Russell Beale as the vile Lavrentiy Beria that steals the show. It's not easy to dip below the slimy levels of Stalin's henchmen, but Beale accomplishes the creepy feat with Shakespearian vigour. Too bad not all of the cast, especially the usually adept Jeffrey Tambor, can't keep up.To the film's credit, the great purge is not a mere backdrop to the Marx Brothers style frivolity, but a harsh companion. Torture and executions mix with all the bumbling. Risky, and perhaps the reason for steering the comedy away from physical to verbal. A bit of an unfilled tease with Monty Pythoner Michael Palin along for the ride, but so be it. Bet Vladimir Putin's not in any hurry to catch this one.",The Death of Stalin
103,hunter-friesen,"Cruel, cold, and hilarious. Everything you want from an Iannucci satire.",7,26 March 2018,"Retelling the last days of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin and the power struggle immediately after as a comedy might not sound like the best idea for a feature film. It's a good thing that Armando Iannucci didn't follow this advice and immediately went ahead and made a crass comedy that pokes fun at one of history's most brutal regimes. He assembled an all-star cast and paired them up with great writing to make one of the best independent comedies of the year. Like the title says, the film tells the true-ish story of how the top leaders of the USSR reacted to the death of their larger than life leader Joseph Stalin. Politicians, generals, committee chiefs, and spymasters engage in all-out war to assume the coveted position of state dictator.The plot of the film is very simple and doesn't get bogged down by unnecessary subplots. Iannucci's time with the series The Thick of It and Veep clearly developed him to be a great writer for political satire. He creates great characters that are all incompetent and power hungry, which is the perfect combination that results in comedic brilliance. We flow from scene to scene with each character and witness some great dialogue being spoken, most of which is just cursed filled banter. The main aspect of the film that comes as a surprise is the way the dark humor is presented. There aren't moments in the film where you feel like you're supposed to laugh. Mainly there are just a couple dozen good parts and you pick and choose which ones you find funny. Don't like a joke about someone being shot in the head? Well, there's a good bit about Stalin falling over dead and pissing himself. Don't like that either? There's a joke about a man wearing his pants incorrectly and that his hairpiece looks like feces. Don't like crude humor in general? Well, then I think you should never watch this film.The actors all fit right into their characters and give them the right amount of credibility and ineptness. Nobody is really that smart in this film, except maybe for Nikita Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi), who, if you know your history, won the power struggle and became premier. Buscemi plays it brilliantly as a man amongst children, all the while lampooning himself. The funniest thing the actors get to do is speak in their natural voice. There are no fake Russian accents, which is a good thing since it would have been extremely annoying to hear. What we get is a mix of nationalities fighting for power. Buscemi's Brooklyn and Tambor's California go against Isaac's hard English and Kurylenko's Ukrainian. I'm not going to congratulate every single actor for a job well done because it would get quite boring and repetitive. However, I would like to give a special congratulations to Jason Isaacs for playing the foul-mouthed and smug General Zhukov. He's hilarious to watch and gives some of the funniest lines. To quote his best line (I hope I heard it correctly): ""I fucked Germany, I think I can take a flesh looping in a fucking waistcoat!""Iannucci has built up a strong following over the years, so I presume all of them will flock to this like squirrels to nuts, not that I'm comparing his fans to squirrels. But for those on the fence, The Death of Stalin is a well made dark comedy that isn't afraid to use history and its participants as a punching bag. It's not great, it's just entertainingly good, and that's all you really need from a comedy.",The Death of Stalin

With a mainly British ensemble, the Monty Pythonesque touch about this dark comedy is hardly surprising. The best part is the way each individual in the Soviet leadership is saving his skin while trying to further his interests i.e. rise to the top. The way they differ about things but ultimately all vote ""unanimously"" is hilarious, as is the way that Stalin and Beria draw up ""lists"" of people to be executed.As the saying goes, ""the greatest truths are told in jest."" It is certainly the case in THE DEATH OF STALIN. Of course, it is not historically faithful, of course it is a kind of spoof that comes out at a curious time when Brits and Russians trade expulsions of embassy personnel; and yet, it nails something about the depravity of those times, and of the MAN OF STEEL (Stalin) who is believed to be responsible for the deaths of some 20 million people.Given the scarcity of thought-provoking movies these days, I was very happy to have watched this film which I see as a minor masterpiece and possibly the best movie I have watched this year.",The Death of Stalin

108,gcsman,"Expertly done, wickedly funny black comedy",8,8 April 2018,"I see that some other reviewers really don't like the idea of pulling black humor out of a real historical event -- in this case, the jockeying for power in the inner circle of the Central Committee of the Soviet Union immediately after the death of one of the most brutal dictators in history. Fair enough, it's a personal response. Most entries into the black-comedy move genre are just completely fictional, so it's an extra step into riskier territory to base it on real events. I can imagine certain setups that I might offensive if they were used as the basis of dark humor (Hitler, or Jesus? but there are examples out there of those too, like Inglourious Basterds). However, Death of Stalin didn't bother me at all, and I'm (almost) old enough to have lived through the actual period. Pulling wry humor out of intrinsically bleak situations is, frankly, yet another human ability.The entire success or failure of such films is in how well they're done. In comedy, timing of dialog and plot details is key, and the timing in this expert production is right on the mark. The ensemble cast delivers: the centerpiece is the competition between Beria (Simon Russell Beale, playing him as a power-hungry control obsessive who ultimately loses to his own overconfidence) and Krushchev (Steve Buscemi, playing yet another version of Steve Buscemi) but the work turned in by the other leads is first rate: Jeffrey Tambor as Malenkov, a somewhat spineless figure who nevertheless wants to be a Big Player; Michael Palin as Molotov, speaking inscrutable dialog that refuses to uncover his real beliefs (if indeed he has any); Andrea Riseborough as daughter Svetlana Stalin, forceful and peripatetic yet oddly powerless, along with Rupert Friend as her wacko brother Vasily; Adrian McLoughlin as Stalin himself, a sort of low-class careless thug; and Jason Isaacs as Zhukov, the no-nonsense field marshal who holds real military power is cheerfully unafraid of any of these crass politicians. A big key is that all their personality types are radically different from one another, so the main driver for the plot is to see how all of them bounce off each other. All were real historical figures and no one is safe from the satirical takes in this production. Adding to the ambience are the sets and settings, which accurately get across the time and place.And yes, it is both black and funny. In one little scene Beria and a colleague are walking along a corridor talking while behind them a body bag rolls down a stairwell, unnoticed. In another, a firing squad interrupts its work halfway through as 'new orders' arrive to spare the political prisoners. The first man NOT to get shot looks down perplexedly at the previous one in line dead on the ground, then over to his equally stunned fellows. Lots more like this.There wasn't a dull moment from beginning to end. Go see it, you'll have fun and even learn a lot about the actual era.",The Death of Stalin

The depth of the mass murders, repressions and near extermination of ethnic minorities like Chechens or better off farmers aka kulaks are simply too deep to be relegated to even an adult comedy. Add to the evils of their system are the mass lies and pervasive poverty and corruption of their system. And how the leftist intellectuals around the world defended that patently evil system for decades. So yes, a film like this is just too flippant for the subject matter. Would anyone tolerate a film like this about Hitler and the Nazis? And finally, though I like Steve Buscemi, give me a break he doesn't resemble Khrushchev in the least.",The Death of Stalin

I was excited to see Michael Palin (Molotov) as I loved him in Monty Python and haven't seen him since A Fish Called Wanda which I also loved.

114,justinwfirestone,It's no Animal Farm,5,4 April 2018,"The Death of Stalin has all of the hallmarks to be a better comedy-satire: good actors, a good story, and bawdy irreverence. Yet it has all the hallmarks of the British sense of humor: a dry wryness, a wry dryness, and a wink-wink-nudge-nudge self-awareness of how selfish, piggish, and unaware humans can be from time to time.Others have suggested this is a poignant political satire, given the current state of affairs. I do not see that, for I do not see the poignancy of watching a badly-toupeed, over-makeuped Jeffrey Tambor frown foolishly, of watching balded Steve Buscemi gesticulate in pajamas, of watching mustachioed Michael Palin downplay his own sense of comedic style.Based on a graphic novel (ahem, big comic book), it recalls icons like Animal Farm or Dr. Strangelove, as we, the people, get to have our final laugh in the face of totalitarianism or fascism because even though these despots were responsible for the deaths of millions, we can reduce them to cinematic boors, so inept you wonder how they even get their pants on each day. Fortunately, The Death of Stalin answers that last wonderment, at least as far as Kruschev is concerned.Oh, how bawdy it is to see one man's girdle strings dangle, another's pajama pants past his suit cuffs, and yet another who is so vodka-drunk he misfires his own spittle into his own hair.

115,steven_torrey,About Stalin or Beria,10,28 April 2020,"The movie opens with Stalin and the Politburo (Malinovsky, Molotov, Khrushchev, etc. ) at Stalin's green Dacha. They are all riotously drunk. While in this drunken state, Stalin is writing out a list of people to be executed by Beria. This scenario is a well documented history, no fiction here.The movie ends with the Politburo now planning to execute Beria before he executes them. Marshal Zhukov (played with comedic/cartoonish overreach) has a role in securing and arresting Beria. In the movie, within a day, Beria is arrested and shot. The Historical truth is that Beria was in fact arrested in June, tried, convicted for treason and executed in December of 1953. Never get your history from Hollywood or Pinehurst Studios.It's not surprising that Russia would not like this movie. The Great Patriotic War, as the Russians still call World War II, (led by Marshall Zhukov) saw the loss of many millions of Russians, not only military but civilian; indeed, Russia lost more than the total all those lost by the Allied Powers including those lost in Germany (both Civilians and Military). So the Great Patriotic War does not lend itself to trivialization or comedy or satire in Russia.Stalin dies and the Politburo falls all over itself with fawning, sycophancy, and competition. And the viewer thinks, this is comedic shtick, right!? No, Stalin's last hours are well documented in the history, and this is pretty much how members of the Politburo responded. While Beria is accurately portrayed as a ruthless murderer, it must be remembered that Khrushchev himself was not so shabby in the murder department either. You then have these two murderers (Beria & Khrushchev) each vying for power against what amounts to the bland political apparatchik (Malenkov, Malinovsky, etc.).Despite the caveat of time between Beria's arrest in June 1953 and execution after trial in December 1953, the movie accurately reflects what the history has documented. The actors give an interpretation of the characters they channel, but the interpretation is fairly accurate. Simon Montefiore describes these events depicted in the film in his book on Stalin.",The Death of Stalin
116,jakob13,"Death of Stalin is weak tea amusing, and a failure to achieve irony or comedy",2,27 March 2018,"Armando Iannuccis' 'Death of Stalin' does work as slapstick, although it has elements of broad humor, absurd situation, and violent actions. Now does it satisfy as a comedy of errors as it explores the scramble for power after the death of Josef Stalin, who ruled the USSR with an iron fist from the death of Lenin until a cerebral hemorrhage fell him in March 1953.
Iannucci's script relates a series of events made ridiculous by any number of faux pas throughout. 
Which raises the question: is Stalin's demise and the jockeying to replace him by his lieutenants--Malenkov, Bulganin, Molotov, Khrushchev and the hated Beria--a subject for opera buffa? Such a treatment minimize, nay makes light of the large shadow that Stalin cast at home and abroad, as well the US' response of a cold wra, witch hunts (a page form Stalin's own playbook) and implanting military bases to hem in the Soviet Union, developing a powerful nuclear arsenal, engagin him hot and cold wars to defeat Communism? 
'The Death of Stalin' strains credulity. It brings to mind the simplistic B films Hollywood made and it does ignore the radio and television dramas that fanned a mindless anti-Communism that alas exists. tody.
Jeffrey Tambour as a feckless Malenkov; Michael Palin, a fretful Molotov; Paul Chahidi as a silent Bulganin; and Steve Buschemi as a Krushchev with a high tone and reedy voice strain credulity as a man who outwitted his rivals and took Stalain's place. (Can this be the man who denounced Stalin's excesses at the 20th Party Congress? or the force man who banged his shoe at a UN General Assembly or frighten the green JFK when they met in Vienna?) As for Kaganovich and Mikoyan they have no real voice at all.Only 
Simon Russel Beale as the feared KGB boss Lavrenti Beria breathes life into his role: a man who embodies the fear of a reign of terror, canny and plotting to remove all his rivals by firing squad, and who clever by half, hoists his own petard by mock trial and summary execution.

The performances are solid, the humour isn't exactly laugh out loud funny but did put a smile on my face, particularly in the second half and the mash of tones worked surprisingly well. The film does kind of reek of missed potential, particularly during the first half, and it wasn't really as interesting as I anticipated that it would be, at least in my opinion.

118,jmvscotland,Very Very Unfunny.,4,28 April 2021,"This is the second time I've tried to review this movie. It appears that my first review was rejected because I quoted (verbatim) one line of dialogue taken from what was actually said in the movie. The movie is full of language that a very few people might these days find offensive. This fact should be no secret to those who might come here to post a review of a movie seen or to look for others' reviews of a movie not yet seen. So WHY is it considered offensive to quote one four letter word from a movie that's packed solid with them? I just don't understand it.Anyway, the movie. Some others here have said that the movie depicts a very British style of humour (and, I assume, spelling). One also said that it's Monty Pythonish in style although I suspect that it's just Michael Palin's minor appearance in the movie that inspired that one. No, to my mind, this is much more slapstick in its style than exhibiting the more subtle and ironic style of humour for which the British are rightly known.""The Death Of Stalin"" is just incredibly UNfunny. I have no problem at all with movie producers making light of very dark periods in history. The movie ""JoJo Rabbit"" is a good example of where a movie sets out to make fun of Hitler and the Nazis, a period in real history which didn't actually cause many laughs as it unfolded. Had this movie ""The Death Of Stalin"" been better written, it might possibly have been funnier than it is in fact.I managed to sit through the whole 1 hour and 45 odd minutes of its tediousness just so that I could sit here with my computer and a clear conscience in writing this warning for others. I didn't laugh once in that 105 minutes and I tittered only once at the single line of dialogue spoken by Steve Buschemi's character, Kruschev to which I referred earlier.What an incredible waste of time this whole thing was. Just as well I paid only three bucks for the Blu-Ray that I bought. It will certainly never be watched again.

As well as the events that proceeded the dictator's death. It's a surprisingly accurate historical that doesn't overstay it's welcome, and adds a nice level of comedy to this important event in history.To start, the movie has hilarious character interactions, and laugh out loud moments. While still respecting history, and the people involved in the history. The film follows the power struggle after Stalin's death, and shines light on the ridiculousness of the true story. Whileost historical films are very serious in their approach, it's refreshing to see a film that saterizes history, and the funny things that actually happened.One thing that always makes me laugh is when Stalin suffers the stroke that ended his life. Two guards were standing outside of the room, and heard suspicious activity. But they too afraid to go inside, because Stalin didn't want to be disturbed, and the two feared being killed if they went inside. And this is 100% true, making it all the funnier. And there are so many other examples of the amazing comedy.To cut it short, ""The Death of Stalin"" is one of the best comedies of all time, and maybe even one of my favorite movies.

Director/co-writer Iannucci may not be the most visually literate of directors-other than a few great scenes like the closing shot he bounces around in pseudo-documentary TV show style-, but he makes up for it with pacy, almost surreally sublime bits of dialogue. The dialogue is really the star of the show, at times seeming almost like something a disgruntled Lubitsch could have come up with. (Okay, maybe not Lubitsch, but at least Billy Wilder).However, Iannucci then make the near-fatal mistake, resorting to sporadic bits of crudity (that ending!) and bouts of distracting profanity, almost as if he doesn't trust the material is edgy enough. Every time he does so, the Lubitsch/Wilder veneer of sophistication drops away and we are given glimpses of a juvenile modern comedy aimed at the college-dropout-trying-to-pose-as-adults crowd.

128,makleen2,Irreverent dramedy lampoons the Soviet Union,9,6 September 2018,"Events surrounding the 1953 death of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin are recounted in The Death of Stalin (2017), a dark and irreverent dramedy written and directed by Armando Iannucci, et al. You'd be wrong if you thought there was nothing funny about a regime responsible for the deaths of 6 to 9 million people. This talented cast perfectly captures the chaotic and absurd at this pivotal moment in Russian history.Joseph Stalin, born Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili, was a principal figure in the rise of communism in Russia and served as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1952. He led the Soviet Union through World War 2, oversaw massive industrialization and collectivization programs, and instituted state terror to maintain control. After his death, his successors undertook reforms and denounced his crimes.The Death of Stalin depicts events from the night of Stalin's (Adrian McLoughlin) cerebral hemorrhage to Nikita Khrushchev's (Steve Buscemi) coup and the execution of NKVD (Soviet secret police) chief Lavrentiy Beria (Simon Russell Beale). It portrays how paranoid and aware of their precarious position members of Stalin's inner circle were, and the struggle to find a leader among a group of frightened sycophants.Lavrentiy Beria was a truly monstrous figure. As soon as Stalin fell ill, he moved to eliminate his enemies and position himself as Stalin's successor, while currying favor with the public with a general amnesty for all prisoners. While the helpless and inept Georgy Malenkov (played brilliantly by Jeffrey Tambor) acted as Premier of the Soviet Union, his rivals fought behind the scenes to take control. They made a critical error by putting Nikita Khrushchev in charge of Stalin's funeral, where he was able to organize a coup with WW2 Soviet military hero Marshal Georgy Zhukov (Jason Isaacs).The Death of Stalin effectively blends comedy, farce, and drama. In one memorable scene, the amnesty order arrives while secret police are executing a line of prisoners. The executioner stops abruptly just before shooting the next man. We see the look of confusion, relief, and disbelief on the prisoner's face, and can only image how we would feel in that situation. Get that man an Oscar!While the film omits background information for the sake of brevity, it could have done a better job explaining some elements of the film, such as why Stalin's doctors were so mistreated. We see Stalin's advisors reluctantly recall a group of physicians to examine Stalin after his cerebral hemorrhage. Stalin's son and daughter berate them, while they are afraid to give a diagnosis.It's assumed they had been arrested for some unspecified political crime, but Stalin's hatred and mistrust of doctors was specifically a result of the ""Doctors' Plot"" a year earlier, when he accused several Kremlin doctors of allegedly plotting to kill him and put them under arrest. It's not a critical oversight, but knowing that background adds to the film's authenticity.The Russian government predictably hated this film, and revoked its distribution certificate. Russian deputies criticized it for making a mockery of Soviet history, called it ""disgusting,"" and even accused it of mocking the victims of Stalinism. Is it okay to laugh at terrible or controversial historical events? How far removed from those events do you have to be to find humor in them?There is a long history of comedians lampooning dictators and dictatorships, using humor to reveal unpleasant truths. Charlie Chaplin released his satire of fascism The Great Dictator (1940) while half the world was at war with Nazi Germany and its allies. Mel Brooks made fun of Nazis and Adolf Hitler in The Producers (1967), only 22 years after Hitler's death and the end of World War 2. These films are widely considered to be cinema classics. The Death of Stalin fits perfectly with this tradition.",The Death of Stalin

Yes, I get it: When one has such an impressive cast to boast, it makes sense to highlight the actors' faces, especially in a movie that is focused on the interaction between different people. The movie is extremely dialogue-heavy... which ultimately means that the creators missed out on an opportunity to tell a story with images. I honestly disrespect movies that could've just as well been a stage theatre play. Why not use what the medium of film has to offer?Besides the genuinely uninteresting cinematography, the whole thing felt contrived, which prevented me from being moved by the movie. Also, since all the characters are equally ridiculous, I didn't have any main protagonist to latch my feelings onto. To some extent I just didn't care what happened to the people in the movie. This lack of a genuine emotional connection could've been repaired by some deep message about communism, or some commentary on the nature of human life in dictatorships-but there was none of that either.So all in all, I felt that this movie was rather pointless, notwithstanding the amazing acting that is to be applauded.",The Death of Stalin

Essentially the movie covers the period shortly before and the afterwards following Stalin (the soviet dictator) death in the 50s. There is a power struggle, and apparently all intelligent and independent thinkingn in Russia has vanished (there is a scene where they observe that all good doctors were executed). We understand how the Russia of today is such a brainwashed nation. It is because genration after generation, people was trained to worship the rulers who were torturing and murdering them (in the movie, the victims pledge allegiance to Stalin before being shot to death by his thugs).The paranoia is constant, and normally the people with power would send to die their own friends ot family, just to show loyalty to the party. It is crazy, but it was the reality. Nowadays, if you talk to any Russian, he would say that those times were great, but that collective a,nesia, ignores the fact that anyone who was not supportive of the regime, woupd ""vanish"", so the majority that remained alive was the hardcore supporters, and the ordinary people who adapts to any situation in order to survive.Schools shpuld be showing this movie in history class, so the new generations could learn what it meant to live under the worst refime in the 20th century.

Except...it's not! If it was a work of fiction, one would say that it would be almost a 'morality play' but again...it's not. It's a film all history, politics and film buffs should see.

150,don2507,Springtime for Stalinism?,9,4 April 2018,"""The Death of Stalin"" is a marvelous piece of satirical filmmaking whose hideous subject Stalin, one of the great monsters of the 20th century, as well as his fearful but complicit henchmen, are featured in this film; and because the hideous crimes and scale of deaths attributable to this ""gang"" are so huge, the satirical and scandalously funny treatment of them reminds me of another wonderful satirical film of a very sober subject, nuclear war, as depicted in ""Dr. Strangelove."" The witty and hilarious screenplay, credited to the director and three others, warrants 10 stars, and the acting at least 9 stars. Michael Palin's Molotov, whose wife Polina has been arrested by Stalin, calls her a parasite and an enemy of ""the Party"", but when Beria has her released (after Stalin's death), he embraces her with great joy. Stalin's henchmen lived in dread of Stalin, and so as the film depicts, when Stalin has his incapacitating stroke, they take their time summoning doctors, and anyway, most of the experienced doctor have already been arrested. In actuality, Stalin was apparently preparing another great purge at the time of his death, and Molotov and Mikoyan, and perhaps Beria, were marked for liquidation. So we see in this film Stalin's list of enemies marked for liquidation replaced by new lists also marked for execution. (It was indeed a tough work environment. It was said that if you gave Stalin too much direct eye contact, you were over-confident and thus plotting against him, and so you were shot. On the other hand, if you avoided eye contact with Stalin, you were shifty and couldn't be trusted, and were most likely plotting against him, and so he had you shot as well.)Of course, the humor may be tempered by the realization that were some 200 million people in the 1950s Soviet Union who were at the mercy of this dictator and his gang, as well as his / their unbending ideology. The director Iannucci was apparently appalled that Stalin's portraits were still prevalent in Russia (unlike Germany's treatment of Hitler) and perhaps he thought a wildly funny portrayal of the succession struggle after Stalin's death would be the most damning evisceration of what Stalinism represented. Or maybe he just likes doing comedy. But I'm not sure even he can top the actual ""comedy"" that emanated from Stalinism. Please forgive me for concluding with this lengthy but crazy anecdote from Joshua Rubenstein's ""The Last Days of Stalin"": The Moscow radio reporter described the 1939 May Day parade and mentioned the top guys reviewing the parade in alphabetic order. That night he was called before Malenkov and asked why he did not put the leaders in the proper order. He said he put Andreyev first because 'A' comes first in the alphabet, and so forth, to which Malenkov replied: ""The Soviet alphabet always begins with 'S,' then comes 'M,' then 'V,' then 'K,' and then 'A.' He meant, of course, Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, and Andreyev. I (the radio reporter) asked him is this alphabet permanent?"" ""No"" he said. ""It may be changed tomorrow, but remember that the alphabet is decided here in the Central Committee, and not in the radio station.""",The Death of Stalin

152,h_sarp,Terrible Mix of History & Comedy & Dialect,1,2 June 2021,"There are many things to be mentioned how wrong this film is;
First of all, no matter what has happened, no country and its actual people should be taken so lightly and historical issues be taken out of context in such a tasteless way. I am not saying that real people should not be subjects of comedy but they have to be treated in comparison to the actual surroundings around their time. Here, it's worth mentioning Monty Python's Life of Brian as a great example.This film does not intend to tell its real story in a broader sense. It starts off as a satire -with not so funny jokes I might - and turns darker and darker while not clearly underlining period's circumstances. All the actors of the Soviet scene at that time remain as shallow caricatures of themselves.Secondly, almost all actors, who are actually one of the finest around, do sound strange with their heavy English and American accents.I wonder if there's any such satire about the atrocities of the Western civilisations who committed terrible acts almost everywhere but in their own land during and after the 20th century.Overall, a very pretentious ""comedy"" and definetely a crippled depiction of the era.

All the actors were speaking with their normal accents which was actually not off-putting like I thought it was going to be. Steve Buscemi, Simon Russell Beale and Jason Isaacs were the stand-outs for me.The most enjoyable aspects were the hilarious critiques of Stalin's regime (e.g the purging of all the most accomplished doctors, the mass arrests etc...) and the power struggle that emerged between Stalin's closest allies.

 The film hinges one hundred percent on the enjoyment of British-styled humor. From very blunt dry humor to long specific jokes that are very well explained, it is definitely not the typical American comedy.

159,wgingery,"An English Drawing Room Tragedy - Set in Moscow -- You're Kidding, Right?",4,19 April 2018,"This film is like a jigsaw puzzle assembled from the partial contents of three or four completely different boxes. The effect is quite peculiar. Some of the edges come together fairly smoothly, but many others overlap in a very bizarre fashion, indeed.First, the film is rooted in English humor. The English bathe in humor; it's a constant in England as away of coping with disappointment with other people and with the system.But it doesn't necessarily travel well. Personally, as an American, it struck me as unfunny from the very first scenes. It made me squirm, not chuckle. Throughout the film, very little hit target.More to the point, though, it's not Russian. The class-bound English depend on etiquette and formality to get along with each other. Russians are much more earthy and spontaneous. When we witness ""Russians"" behaving like proper middle-class Englishmen and women, it jars our sensibilities and seems unreal. Second, Iannucci draws on the genre of drawing room farce to bear the burden of brutality and tragedy. However, comedy depends on the convention that the heroes are never really harmed. As applied to the monstrous crimes of Stalin and the Soviet system, Iannucci's brand of humor doesn't seem elastic enough. How to square the circle? Iannucci has not figured it out. 
 
Third, the director provides no avenue into the film; he keeps the audience at a distance. A comic, they say, is a frustrated idealist. People don't measure up. That is why comics in real life are invariably angry at everyone and hard to get along with. The audience, in turn, senses the anger under the humor.Also, as paradoxical as it may seem, the leaders and many, though by no means all, of the inhabitants of the Soviet Union maintained a certain idealism. They knew they were committing horrors, but they justified them in the name of the future. Vain, yes; power-mad, yes; absurd, yes; but also devoted. Unfortunately, though Iannucci does convey a bit of this in Khrushchev's part, it doesn't pervade the mentality of the action. Consequently, it's as though the characters are suspended in air with nothing supporting them.",The Death of Stalin

161,neobateman,"A crude, politically incorrect but also intelligent satire.",8,24 March 2018,"'The Death of Stalin' saw a really limited release in 2017 with very limited reviews and opinions. It's wide release around the world was in March of 2018, which means I can classify this as a 2018 film. I can predict this is going to be one of the best films this year. The picture was directed by Armando Iannucci who generally directed TV shows, however has received critical acclaim for his 2010 project In the Loop. After the Soviet Union dictator Joseph Stalin (who ruled Russia for the past 29 years) unexpectedly dies. His cabinet made most notably of Nikita Khrushchev, Georgy Malenkov and Vyacheslav Molotov is falling apart trying to figure out what direction the Soviet Union is going to go in next. Steve Buscemi plays Khrushchev, it's great seeing Buscemi in a leading role for a film again. He plays Khrushchev with enough sympathy but also an over the top and xany behaviour. This clearly is a parody of who we assume Khrushchev was. The film boasts a very interesting ensemble which includes: Jeffrey Tambor, Andrea Riseborough, Olga Kurylenko, Jason Isaacs, Michael Palin and Simon Russell Beale. The majority of these actors are incredibly underrated and it's great seeing them get the opportunity to play unique and interesting characters. In particular I'm going to single out Simon Russell Beale and Jason Isaacs. Beale plays Lavrenti Beria, he is a member of Stalin's cabinet. His performance is truly diabolical, at first he is stone cold. He has no problem with sentencing people to death and laughing with it. He acts natural around horrible events which makes him very darkly funny. It is very obvious that he has his own ambitions. Isaacs is Field Marshal Zhukov, he is in charge of the Red Army. There is a sense of ruthlessness behind his eyes that makes him a force to be reckoned with. The film is really cleverly written, never afraid to drop f bombs and other curse words. What was interesting is that both Beria and Khrushchev are trying to paint themselves as the reformers. Their conflict is comical because they act like little children with constant bickering and no problem solving. A classic theme is when a leader dies the line between order and chaos disappears, anarchy arises within a land. The Death of Stalin offers an interesting spin on this idea as the afore order was the control of a dictator who was responsible for the death of millions. The camera work is fast and kinetic. It helps drawing the audience in and keeps them locked during the many conversation scenes. The biggest issue I had was with the character played by Olga Kurylenko. Without trying to spoil anything, there is an interesting character presented, however she doesn't seem to go anywhere. She is barely in the movie and didn't add much, this is my only flaw with the Death of Stalin. I highly recommend this film, however I must warn you this is not a drama. Many elements of this film that would generally be considered as atrocities are pulled for laughs here. If you're going to see this please keep the expectations on check. This is the closest thing we've had to a Monty Python's style of comedy.",The Death of Stalin

But as satire it somehow didn't work. I appreciate that the director and scripting did pay indeed credit to the real, gruesome details of Stalin's dictatorship, naming and representing them in the movie without any filter. But it's exactly this what collides with the satirical, tragic mood of the movie. I think it's not really possible to make a synthesis of a reign of terror and a funny look at it, since the realities behind are just to terrible. Specially it you have a historic awarness of the facts. For someone without that background knowledge it may work better.As of german tongue I can say that the many analog attempts of satire over Hitler (in movies), nazi Germany being a topic of german obession up to this day, also none of them really worked, the facts behind are just to dreadful. As a successful exception the movie Schtonk (1992) may be named, which however focused on a sideline of the history, the fake diaries of Hitler.",The Death of Stalin

167,sagniknath,A delightful retelling of the chaos following Stalin's death in the style of Arrested Development,8,23 February 2018,"Stalin was no angel. A sociopath who firmly held on to his throne by inciting fear, paranoia and killings of random ""Enemies of the State"". Thus it should come of no surprise that his death would leave behind a enormous power vacuum that had to be sealed else the lives of his followers, minsters and eventually the entire Soviet population would be sucked into that abyss. This is where his bungling team of closely knit sycophantic ministers of The Central Committee intervene and engage in a rat race to become Stalin's successor. The bunch in this dark comedy interact quite cordially when they all meet but, since this is the Soviet Union, none would would bat an eye to silence the others if it gave him unrestrained access to the title of General Secretary. I liked all the actors in the ensemble cast; they never featured much as lead roles but portrayed amazing supporting characters in movies and television. Steve Buscemi was ever dependable and likable as sort of the anti hero Kruschev .Jeffrey Tambor as Malenkov brought along the flair and comedic deadpan expressions of Arrested Development. However, I wished they brought more light to the character of Lavrenti Beria,the First Secretary and Official Pedophile of the Soviet Union. They sort of just give 2 or 3 brief scenes where his excessively inhumane traits are shown but they are more like pointers to the audience that he is probably the crooked of the lot. 
As reference, I would highly recommend the 1983 dark comedy Red Monarch which is very similar plotwise to The Death Of Stalin but showed the character of Beria to a greater detail (I initially googled """"Stalin Beria comedy film"" since I had forgotten the name but the search results were all flooded with Death of Stalin references only. So it took me quite a while to finally recall the name since it turns out the film is quite obscure) . Some of the reviews are criticizing Death of Stalin as ineffective satire or bad history. Satire, this definitely isn't. As I have pointed out, it's more of a comedic retelling of those past events. And as for authenticity, I am pretty sure thorough fact checking is least on your agenda when you try to mix Communism with Comedy. The point is more of an intentional, slightly over the top representation of the anarchy that flourished in the Union . If you the viewer are intrigued by the overall story after watching, you definitely should read actual historical narratives for more accurate information. So, in conclusion, Death of Stalin is nothing exceptional or breaking new ground but it certainly calls for a one time watch.",The Death of Stalin

169,RagingDraugr,"An hilariously frenetic comedy, that also works as an insightful, if satirical and purposefully inaccurate look into the period after Stalin's death.",9,17 November 2018,"'The Death of Stalin' is utterly fantastic. While it is predominately focused on being a dark comedy film, it still functions, quite clearly, as a political thriller - with the mind games that each individual makes to curry favour with another being fascinating to watch.Needless to say, the positives of this movie far outweigh the negatives. First of all, the brilliant and varied performances of each member of the cast makes every character memorable, even if their names don't 'stick' in your head as much. Secondly, the cinematography is equally powerful with many great sweeping shots that show off the impeccable set design and costume work, as well as pretty clever uses of scene blocking here and there - although, in all fairness, the cinematography isn't completely consistent throughout with many shots merely being adequate. Thirdly, there were a lot of clever metaphors and usage of symbolism throughout the film; most notably, with the orchestra at the beginning being inter-cut with the removal of Russian citizens to Gulag prison camps - showing the ""orchestration"" of the governmental forces behind the scenes.This also hints at the aforementioned 'mind games' that are about to begin. Furthermore, the use of 'Articles' to show governmental proceedings and what is about to take place in the scene complements the Totalitarian and systematic nature of the Soviet Union government - juxtaposed by the fact that, with the death of Stalin, everyone is naturally in a frenzied panic (either vying for control or looking for what to do next) climaxing with a political coup to 'remove' Beria from trying to assert any more power, something which he has been carefully building over the course of the film (And of course, by 'removal', I mean being found guilty in a kangaroo court and being shot in the head. What do you expect? This is the Soviet Union, after all).My only major criticisms of the film is that, as stated previously, the cinematography can be occasionally iffy, and that the editing in some areas could have done with a bit more polishing (e.g. the slow-mo audio effect in one scene is poorly inserted and you can hear the audio 'cut off' when the character is done speaking, because there's a noticeable amount of noise in the audio clip).Still, if you're looking for a great comedic political thriller, this might be the film for you.

When I first saw this film shortly after its release, I proposed that it was likely to be the funniest film of 2017. Now we're firmly into 2018 and I've given it a second and third viewing, I can confirm that I was almost certainly right - The Death of Stalin might not have given the most outrights laughs in a single 90-minute period as other films but it certainly left me (and, as I have read, others also) with the greatest number of memorable moments that I can still remember now. You know the ones I mean - where you burst out laughing at silence and have to explain that it's because of a scene of a man spitting onto his own forehead you saw once many months ago.The film starts immediately fast in a concert hall, escalates through Stalin's death (spoiler alert?), past the rigged committee meetings and into the culmination of plots, coups and counter-plots. It's funny enough to keep you ticking over with the occasional titter but every now and then it hits you with a proper belly laugh. Some of it is of course made up (like the opening concert hall scene) but Iannucci is keen to point out that some of its more ridiculous aspects are real - for example, Stalin's son Vasily really did try to cover up a plane crash that killed an entire Soviet Air Forces ice hockey team in 1950.
 
Unlike with past Armando Iannucci political satires The Thick of It and In the Loop, the array of bumbling officials shown to be smart in theory but useless in practice are given real names based on real historical figures - even though the film is actually based on a French comic book of the same name. A major difference to his previous work is that the stakes are much higher when a political figure makes a political mistake - instead of the oh-so-British punishment of embarrassment, it's a bullet to the head! This makes for a handful of incredibly dark moments (mostly at the hands of Simon Russel Beale as Lavrentiy Beria, the Head of the Soviet Secret Police) but there's nothing that overshadows the trademark cutting dialogue.The unique selling point of this film is that all the actors retain their native accents for their Soviet characters - there's something strangely satisfying to hear Khrushchev's words in Buscemi's Brooklyn tongue or the feared head of the Soviet Army possessing a deep Yorkshire (Sheffield?) accent. Some have flagged this as an issue for the film but it could very well be Iannucci's way of saying that this might've happened (sort of) in 1950s Soviet Russia, but you should also expect similar schemes, plots and plans to happen in the corridors of Westminster, Washington ... or Moscow.",The Death of Stalin

Filled with mass killings, executions, rape, torture and most of all, authorized murder! I know this makes it sound like the movie might be flippant since IT IS a comedy, but be assured: The Death of Stalin is a Black Comedy masterpiece! Masterpiece, does describe this film well: a masterpiece in directing, writing, acting, casting AND comedy! But the first two, we really have Armando Iannucci to thank! Both his writing and directing of this film are simply brilliant!His writing: one thing I noticed about this film after seeing it, was how even though it really made me laugh was how brilliantly it portrayed the madness, political backstabbing and shear lunacy of those dark times. The script is a brilliant and dynamic piece of writing! It's sharp, cynical and absolutely hilarious! One thing I look for and often don't find in modern comedies is actual comedic material, but I'm happy to say that in The Death of Stalin I actually found material that really made me laugh! Several scenes: the actual death of Stalin, moving his body, Paul Whitehouse dialogue, the appearances of Stalin's crazy children, Stalin's funeral and the arrival of Field-Marshal Zhukov are just some of the brilliant and hilarious sketches in the movie. But as I was saying, this movie really shows just how crazy the events at that time were, and to simplify: C orders B to shoot A and then has D shoot B, then E orders D to execute C but then F has G kill E and D... You get the picture, and Iannucci writes all that brilliantly. There are sequences in this film that resemble a Tarantino stand-off! Now I've reviewed his writing, onto his directing. In this area, Iannucci excels also! Every single member of the cast is on TOP-FORM and all deliver hilarious and authentic performances! Steve Buscemi is a very enjoyable presence as Khrushchev. He plays someone trying to keep on top of the slippery political pyramid and trying to stay alive, and he plays that character really well, with authenticity and charisma! That is not something you can say about Simon Russel Beale as the monster that was Lavrentiy Beria! He plays the part very well and shows the complete sadistic monster that Beria was. Here was a man that would use the power he had to punish and murder many innocent people, here was also a vile rapist and Beale plays that so well that when his death and subsequent incineration comes, you actually are a little glad! Jeffrey Tambor also delivers a very enjoyable and real performance as Georgy Malenkov and delivers the line: ""when I said 'no problem', what I meant was 'no...problem' brilliantly! There are of course the hilariously crazy performances of Rupert Friend and Andrea Riseborough as Stalin's children. They're both absolutely crazy but play that craziness really well and with real zest! But (for me) the real highlight of the cast was Jason Isaacs as Field Marshall Zhukov. He delivers a hilarious performance as the OTT, violent, Yorkshire- accented Russian war hero. He's simply ringing with charisma! The rest of the cast including Michael Palin, Olga Kurylenko, Paul Whitehouse and several others really deliver smart and funny performances as well that have real charisma and comedy in them. This film really delivered with all these factors and I really did love it and so would certainly recommend this brilliant comedy to anyone...FINALLY, an actually funny modern comedy!",The Death of Stalin
174,metztex,Surprisingly good dark satire but close to historical naritive,8,13 January 2020,"Bottom Line Up Front: This dark satire takes some liberties with history but does stay rather close to the facts. Depicts the hysteria and the overwhelming fear instilled by Stalin and Beria in the late 40s and early 50s up to Stalin's death. If you like docu-dramas you will like this one. If not, don't bother.No spoilers if you know your history.I was pleasantly surprised by this film thinking it was going to show a lot of comedy with an intent of making light of the tumultuous time following Stalin's death. Instead, this film in many ways accurately depicted what it, quite possibly, like to be in the inner circle of Central Committee members at the time. It also showed the difference between Beria, who was a sadistic and a very sick individual, and who would become the next leader of the USSR, Khrushchev.What made this film compelling was the depiction of the fear and the sense of urgency to ensure control of an extremely centralized form of government. It also shows the trust between Khrushchev and Zhukov (head of the army) as they both served in WWII and played pivotal roles in the war. They understood one another and trusted each other to protect the state.Thankfully Khrushchev became the next leader and not Beria. If Beria had become leader, I don't think the Cuban missile crisis would have turned out well for either side. While Khrushchev was ruthless it was necessary under the Soviet system to ensure Beria and the NKVD were removed permanently (was eventually merged into the MVD and KGB). This cleared the way for many of Khrushchev's reforms (not depicted in the film as Khrushchev's reforms were so ""progressive"" for more freedoms, he was removed by Brezhnev and reversed many of Khrushchev's reforms).",The Death of Stalin

176,ryansalamence,Clever visual humor,8,3 May 2018,"Managed to catch this one because it barely has any screenings near me; almost went under my radar. It's a great dumb dark dramedy taking place in the Soviet Union just after Stalin's death, and follows different people in government as they trip and fall trying to climb their way to the top. Steve Buscemi and Jeffrey Tambor were both absolutely hilarious and I loved their characters. The humor was dark and dumb, but sometimes pretty clever, which worked well in the film's favor. There was also lots of great visual comedy, something most of todays comedies don't know how to do. The directing, set design, and attention to detail all come together to make the film very realistic, there was 1000x more effort put into this film than most modern comedies, which is absolutely worth mentioning.",The Death of Stalin

I spent the entire movie appalled as Beria (Simon Beale) and Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi) jockey to take over from the just-deceased Stalin, from the slapstick attempt to move Stalin's body to working their limousines into the funeral procession.

179,TheDragonTrader,"Funny, but at times insulting",5,22 September 2018,"I allmost wet myself from laughter in several scenes, let me start by saying that. When it gets you, it gets you good.But the greatest problem I had with this movie, is that every hillariously brilliant scene was followed by a scene that tried to invoke a laugh but wasn't funny at all. And as a result it kept losing me and winning me back and losing me over and over again, which was quite annoying.Furthermore we have to talk about it's terrible runtime that is waaaay to long, or at least felt like that. Lots of scenes are just unnecessary or plainly stupid.Also, as historically accurate the depiction of the battle for power between the characters after Stalin's death may be, some moments that are critical to the plot are plain lies! And although the writers probably did this for comedic reasons, the result is just very insulting towards the Russians. Which makes the cencorship on this film in Russia, that we all found so hillarious, that bit more understandable.And to end, here are some things I loved about this movie:
The cast is amazing!
The music should be remembered forever! Thát's how you score a comedic movie properly, taking note of the time and place and characters, rather than of how to make the music sound stupidly funny.
And certain scenes gave me belly aches from laughter.So watch it, laugh, be aware of the true history behind it. For it isn't all too bad a movie, yet not as good as many give it credit for.",The Death of Stalin

181,ramlmmjem,A true black comedy,9,15 May 2020,"This is a true black comedy that fits firmly into the movie family tree that includes The Loved One, Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale, and Delicatessen but with the added shiver factor that the characters being portrayed were once real people doing the things they are portrayed doing in this film.The idiocy of the over-weaning bureaucratic state are displayed as is the potential disfunction of the use of fear to govern. (It is downplayed a little in the film but Stalin was left lying on the floor for many hours because those around him were too afraid to enter his room to find out what had happened for fear of extreme punishment.)The characterisations are very good with excellent acting. The accents may jar a little initially and at times the language may be too much for your great-aunt Matilda but they reflect the fact that the Soviet leadership comprised a mixture of people from a variety of backgrounds and regions of the vast country and not all were 'cultured'.The storyline has been adjusted to meet the needs of a clean plot (especially concerning the timing of the trial and execution of Beria), although not to the extent that it distorts history too much. I'd recommend reading the 'bloopers' section of the IMDB page on the movie to clear up any possible misunderstandings.My only real quibble? Khrushchev (played brilliantly by Steve Buscemi) was actually quite a short man - 5 ft 2 inches. In the film, he's portrayed as lot taller. Not much of a quibble!!My advice? Settle yourself down, get out the popcorn and a drink of your choice and prepare for a rattling good movie.",The Death of Stalin

Various parties within the Soviet Government quickly plot to set themselves up as the new leader and to remove their rivals. Unfortunately for the audience, this is no white knuckle political thriller, because the players in this game are the most insane, over-the-top, and incompetent bunch of neurotic imbeciles that I have seen on screen since the show Arrested Development.

As a person not old enough to have lived through it, but not young enough either to be ignorant about it, especially because I live in a country which was deeply involved in communist repression (Romania), I have to admit the film was refreshing. If one can't part with the terrible past laughing at it after so many years, then one might be condemned to repeat it, one way or another. Ok, the historical truth is distorted and reinterpreted, either in terms of chronological order, or social relations, but nobody claimed it is - or has to be- accurate in every respect. It's a work of art and as such it allows re-interpretations. The dialogues are often deeper than they sound, the background of many scenes is so carefully crafted and the balance between irony and sarcasm is finely preserved, not without tuches of macabre. Buscemi and Tambor deserve my praise among a cast which isn't lacking talent. A special mention to the final credits... Oh, that young Brezhnev behind Khruschev...",The Death of Stalin

The film is a more satirical version of what happened in the few days following the said tragic event.Having seen the film, it seems more to me like an over the top historical drama, which has been well made and adapted for the big screen. It educates the audience on the events of the power struggle in Russia, showing some of the might and tyranny of Stalin, highlighting awful events that occurred at the time, whilst also taking the mick out of the situation, but showing how ridiculous the well-known comedians portray that event. Although some consider it to be more of a dark comedy, we found it quite amusing, as the character development of Steve Buscemi as the next ruler of the communist party is shown to be a ridiculous event, whilst the killings of innocent people continue.Regarding my professional opinion, the film was quite well shot and managed to portray the colder colours of the USSR using different light and shadow techniques, as well as colour grading. What I found very amusing was the fact that the set designers left the lights in the scene deliberately, in order to light the shots and serve as old projectors in the late 50s. Overall, the editing pace might have been slow in some places or others, however the film worked and kept my attention throughout.",The Death of Stalin

It's certainly reassuring to see a capitalist pig like Iannucci disproving the point by putting out this well-produced yet utterly worthless garbage.
I can't think of a single reason why an artist would choose the death of Stalin as a backdrop for a supposed comedy. Is it to underline the historicity of the events? Not in this case. To ease the impact of the subject matter onto the audience without spooking them and prematurely turning them away from the film? Sure, if they don't know who Stalin was going in. Is it to showcase your comedic chops employing as unexpected and controversial material as can be without ending up on somebody's hit list? If so, ""The death of Stalin"" is an epic fail for an otherwise acclaimed comediograph.Why then?I guess I'll never know. The taste of ""The death of Stalin"" is so bad, my viewing capacity had run out in twenty minutes. I just got tired of looking at mock-Moscow (filmed, unsurprisingly, in Kiev, Ukraine - wink wink) in full summer bloom.

191,Grumphy,Stalin's dead! Long live the satire!,7,18 January 2018,"Death of StalinAKA how to tell the story of human greed so that it's entertaining and revolting at the same time. AKA if history books/teachers would tell things even slightly as colourfully as this, more people would pay attention. The story is very well presented. Artistic liberty is backed by major facts. Dialogue is witty and fuels the situations in which most of the humour lies. And most of everything is in contrast with everything. People are in contrast with each other and with themselves and with humanity. The story takes some really grim turns at times. Quite unexpectedly so. It kind of cheats you to think it's a more light hearted piece of work than it actually is. It's not. That also is a form of contrast. Acting leaves little to be desired. Though the pronunciations of some of the names can perhaps be a bit of a put off. For people with a little more knowledge in Russian language than vodka, medved i babuschka. Luckily they don't over use the names and convincing acting makes it more than even. At first I didn't even think that Steve Buschemi is fit (as in necessary shape) to play Khrushchev, but at the end I had no doubt that he was the perfect choice. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. Beria is as intimidating and repulsive as one can imagine. Perhaps Stalin's son is the biggest question mark, because he was straight out of control and can therefore seem a bit too theatrical than perhaps necessarily comfortable without it actually being so.Visuals are decent. Definitely not great, and the budget reflects that, but then again the focus is completely on something else. Camera movement is nicely put to work to help the story. Some nice plays with the use of perspective. General tone and the pace of editing fits the purpose. Directing is nuanced and well thought out. I wouldn't say that the film is hilarious, however. Not many films are, in my opinion. It's funnier in some places, more sinister in others. Humorous for the most part. But hilarious, no. That would be too much of a contrast perhaps. Too much of a grotesque. Too horrifying to laugh out loud from the beginning to the end. Only a complete moron or someone with complete disregard for humanity would do that. Because, though this is just a film, what happened, really happened. And I am not talking about what is seen, but what is not.

Given that Beria so resembles Dick Cheney physically in this movie, can we expect a similar film by this production team on that other equally moral gentleman?

195,beargod-48706,Historically semi accurate but entertaining,7,11 September 2020,"Now to begin with, this is not a documentary. It's a part fiction, history based black comedy. The actors do a pretty good job portraying the main characters. It's natural that some things are sped up or just portrayed differently. The focus of the film is to estabilish a sort of villain, Berija. The only problem is that the film succesfully makes you forget the real life deeds of the other participants.
Khruschev, Lazar Khaganovic, Malenkov, Molotov all suported and took part in the implementation of the deportations, purges, that cost millions of lives.
Later it was Khruschevs decision to crush the 1956 Hungarian uprising. So they all had gallons of blood on their hands. But they mostly are presented as merry old man. Sure, Berija stood out in being cruel and he also was a serial killer. In the film it is only shown that his bodyguards hand buquets to every girl he had raped. In reality those that did not accept the buquet had to deal with the NKVD and he also strangled some of the rape victims to death.

199,Mrbrown43,Death of Stalin: Fun times in Soviet Russia,8,14 March 2018,"A black comedy is a hard thing to get right; you have to firstly find the fun in dark subject matter and then convince your viewer/player/reader that what they are seeing is funny and can be laughed at. In the worst case scenario you would be considered an edgy unfunny hack that does not understand anything about the subject matter being tackled. That is not the case with this movie fortunately. Death of Stalin starts in 1953 with Russian leader Joseph Stalin suffering a heart failure and dying, it is very sad (not really) and hilarity ensues with a power struggle between statesman Nikita Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi) and leader of the NKVD Lavrentiy Beria (Simon Russell) all the while trying insure the other does not get too much power and trying to stay alive. Please do not think that Death of Stalin does not gloss over the atrocities of Stalin's rule any more than it does ignore the violence that occurred after Stalin dies. I would say that it respectively balances the humour with the horror; it is able to use some of the terror the NKVD used on Russian citizens for comedy but also knows when to behave seriously. It gets rid of that tonal problem that affects so many black comedies and horror comedies. Director Armando Iannucci and crew should be congratulated for it. The acting is extremely good, they look the part and are convincing in their roles, the little detail of letting the cast speak with British and American accents is a strange yet somewhat brilliant, and it builds a surreal feel to it that makes everything just a little bit funnier. But one standout presence in this film is Jason Isaacs's performance as Georgy Zhukov, the moment he enters you know you are in for a ride, he is easily brings the most laughs as well has the most memorable quotes in the movie, he is the best. The film has a loose relationship with historical accuracy, it does mostly follow the core events of the power struggle (if you know anything about Russian history after Stalin you know who is going to win) but it is still compelling enough for even someone like me, a student of history to enjoy and remain focused for it's entirety. The pacing is smooth and the jokes come in fast and well. The trouble with comedy movies is that there is a lot of spoilers in regards to jokes that I cannot talk about, it is all well and good to say that the writing is good or that it is a great comedy without going into any detail about how the jokes work or why this film is a satire on the inherent silliness of the communism and dictators.

200,Mikheil-H,Death of Stalin Review,8,17 March 2021,"In terms of body count, Stalin is responsible for more deaths than Hitler and the Nazis. So why make a comedy about the demise of, arguably, the most evil man in history? Because it is rightfully hilarious.Steve Buscemi's conspiring ""Nikita Kruschev"" competes for power against Simon Russel Beale's equally conniving ""Lavrentiy Beria"" as they both try and maintain order and control Stalin's panicked central committee. Based off the French book of the same name - ""La mort de Staline"" - the film takes us through a rollercoaster ride via the Russian people's response, the various committee meetings and Stalin's funeral service, showing different aspects to this landmark in history. Steve Buscemi reclaims former acting glory, spouting out lines faster than any of the committee members running to comfort Stalin's daughter and gain her favour. Jason Isaacs also gives a surprisingly strong performance as the domineering head of the Red Army ""Georgy Zhukof"".The Death of Stalin is a rare treat for comedy lovers as, currently, we are in an age of 'simple comedy', meaning a lot of movies now rely on the stupidity of characters and slapstick to get laughs. Thankfully, the death of Stalin does not subscribe to these same ideals. It is very much a black comedy, with the humour relying on clever lines, character interactions and the absurd situations that the individuals involved find themselves in. The director, Armando Iannucci, uses his impressive writing skills to not only keep the viewer laughing, but also giving us time to reflect on the events unfolding. I confess that I have no real knowledge of this point in history, yet I still found it a delight, meaning anyone who loves history, especially Russian history, will absolutely adore this picture.Of course, being a British-French comedy, it is inevitable for scepticism being aimed at the validity of events being shown. This is certainly the belief of current Russian cultural ministers who are considering a ban on the film. However, after doing some brief research online, it is apparent that the majority of the film is accurate to real life which, in the end, makes the film that much more hilarious. Although, the film is not perfect, whilst being a black comedy it certainly lies heavily on the comedic side giving less thought, than may be necessary, to the horrors that our protagonists have committed in the past. As a result, it loses the thought-provoking angle of if we should support the people we are viewing or otherwise. Furthermore characters, such as Olga Kurylenko's Stalin-hating ""Maria Yudina"", are criminally underutilised. Also, the film does jump around a lot, occasionally revealing what felt like a couple days being a few weeks, this can take you out of the film, but it doesn't affect overall enjoyment.If you feel like a Russian guard debating whether to investigate the death of one of the most tyrannical men in history, consider it as a new take on history. Even though it it may not take itself as seriously as the subject matter may require and there is no sign of a Russian accent anywhere, the death of Stalin is still a shining light for comedy, similar to what it was for history.",The Death of Stalin
201,Jozinek,Funny yet dark and gritty historical comedy/political thriller.,8,25 December 2019,"""The Death of Stalin"" is basically an over-the-top depiction of Soviet culture and history which discards historical accuracy in favour of hilarious (and sometimes extremely tense) interactions with the cast using their normal accents (which makes it even funnier). This movie felt like Westerners mocking the east and that's probably why it was banned in countries like Russia and Kazakhstan 😂. Honestly, I respect the seriously ballsy attitude that the director had when making this film: filming in Russia whilst openly making fun of their history. I truly respect creators not being in fear of their work being banned in certain countries and not changing it just so those countries will be satisfied.The other positives of this brilliant black comedy are: the amazing performances all around, the impressive production quality, the ingenious writing and the directing. There was never a moment in this film where I was bored or a moment where I cringed, it managed to fully engage me into the story and characters (or should I say, caricatures of historical figures). The best thing is, in my view, that you don't need to know Russian history to enjoy this (as I said before, it discards historical accuracy in favour of comedy, which isn't always a bad thing, this film is shining evidence of that).",The Death of Stalin

Why not make a black comedy about the death of Stalin? It has all the ingredients. Except it doesn't work. It doesn't work as a dark comedic satire; it doesn't work as drama. Several actors seem to have wandered in from other films (Jason Isaacs seems have dropped in for a visit from a funnier film.) Why doesn't it work? The actors are fine, but they don't seem to have gelled (jelled?) as a cast. Tambor isn't the least bit funny, which is strange. How can you make Jeffrey Tambor not funny?The timing is off. The film feels flat. The satire lands with a thud. The corpse-like makeup on the characters is too obvious. We get it. They're surrounded by death because they cause death; they are death.

Similarly although the actors are not physically like the subjects they portray they recreate characters who were in real life were brutal, craven, scheming and paranoid. For instance Jason Isaacs portrayal of the gruff Zhukov is brilliant, as is Michael Palin's Molotov to name but two. It is well paced and an immensely satisfying movie from start to end.

The movie shows nicely the characteristics of the ""unified"" party of the CCCP which in it's union is constantly plotting against each other and trying to take power whenever possible. There really aren't any good or bad guys, just men going after power and using anybody in order to get it. Characteristics work without going completely over the top. The movie doesn't give an accurate view of the history, but it isn't the movie's job. It is a parody and as such does a good job in giving entertainment. Another view would surely give new viewpoints to the movie.",The Death of Stalin
208,Ska4Live,Laugh at the times of terror,8,28 January 2018,"Let me begin, that this movie is absolutely farcical and absurd is the way of telling history. I completely understand it was based on 'Titan comics', but for people who lived their entire life in Eastern Europe, and whose family's had lose their love one and family members, during Communistic regime in 1922 - 1991, this work from Iannucci is 'Too much'. Because the way how movie shows NKVD(The People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs) with its manager Lavrentiy Beriya and structure and methods of this organization, in some comical and ironical way, I am sorry but this not a case for jokes, you guys. The scenes with people executions and regular night arrests by NKVD doesn't looks like crime, it is more - permanent process on weekdays. Anyway, lets focus more on film itself.At the ACT 1 and ACT 2 of the movie, director is trying to shows completely weakness of decision making process between characters, after 'mustache leader' gone. Someone's are playing in political poker trying to bring more positive and bright into people lives, after Stalin's years of terror. Someone trying to build a new country with new reforms and laws. Someone wish to leave all like it is and lives by the same rules as it was before. Someone is too weak in taking own decisions and they change, like a water takes the form based on environment. It sounds like everyone from team has some their individuality and strong sides, but when it comes time to vote or take single or group responsibility for some action - each one of them become little kid and afraid to say something. It this way, the next leader should be a person who does not afraid to take a step forward and unite everyone others with his\her ideas. And this is why at the end of ACT 2 we saw two main individuals who would fight against each other for taking golden Kremlin 'throne'. All of this takes place with a lot of humor and irony together with... IDK.. some warm colors, maybe. In ACT 3 we already don't see comedy. Everything become more brutal and cold. We become witnesses of how people takes real power and become leaders. Undercover negotiations. People tragedy that can be used like great change to remove your political opponent. The feeling of self powerless. Brutal unjudged process of execution. And old leader take the same fate as all his previous victims - by clause 'Enemy of USSR people'. I must say the atmosphere of movie is amazing. Each of character actually playing important role in this project. Dialogs - they are hilarious! The way how personages change their entire idea of the line, in 2 second, just because situation around of him was changed - is truly amazing. Makeup and costumes are also great. Locations - ohh, many of location were filmed in my lovely Kyiv. However if like to look on the details, you can easily find plastic window in old apartment house and also modern fully glazed balcony's on surrounding building. But lets just see on this as a 'Director vision'. Overall I think this film must be shown to every citizen of post soviet countries in order just to remind people how stupid, brutal and selfish can be politicians when they trying to reach their goals.",The Death of Stalin
209,augustkellerwrites,Sharp & Cruel,8,4 June 2018,"Some may be disturbed by its dark humor but the brutal honesty that The Death of Stalin is able to get across while poking fun at the absurdities of the situation is a feat to behold. Never too cheeky and just cruel enough, this film balances its tone through its brilliant acting and clever writing. From the mind of Armando Iannucci and given to the experienced cast of Steve Buscemi, Jeffery Tambor and Simon Beale; this is a movie that oozes with craft. Mixing gags with horrific moments, The Death of Stalin's ambition is only matched by its wit as it takes its viewers through the wild ride of top political power movement and shows off the mixed motivations of its devious characters.As many comedies do, The Death of Stalin sometimes lacks mind-blowing effects or a surplus of artful camerawork but that is more than made up for with razor-sharp humor. This film's way of pointing out the extremes people will go to for power, manipulation or fear (in a word: politics) is impossible to ignore. This movie achieves every goal that a charged, political comedy wants to achieve because it gets honorable laughs and also leaves viewers with poignant food for thought. Simply put, The Death of Stalin is political satire done right.Writing: 9/10

211,thorr97,Dark Humor About A Truly Dark And Humorless Time,9,1 April 2018,"This is an excellent film. And its treatment of the Stalin Era of the Soviet Union is both darkly humorous and actually very unflinching in its depicting the monsters and their monstrosities for what they were.I was worried that, in an attempt to extract humor from the situation that they might've glossed over just how monstrous the key characters actually were. To Iannucci and Schneider's credit however, there was absolutely no glossing over at all. Beria, for instance, is portrayed as every bit the monster in human form that he was - this, even as that portrayal is also made darkly and delightfully humorous at times.The whole cast played their parts well and played them ""straight"" - which only heightened the humor and the horror of what life was like under Stalin in the Soviet Union. Even the nominal ""hero"" of the tale, Nakita Khrushchev, is realistically portrayed as being just as conniving and callous and power hungry as everyone else. Buscemi would seem an odd choice for that particular role but he pulls it off with style and excellence. So too does Simon Russell Beale in his portrayal of Beria. This is a nicely done film with excellent production values, a great script, fine acting, excellent pacing, and a compelling tale that is well told.I highly recommend it!",The Death of Stalin

I do not think it's a bad film- I understand the political satire and the intent of the humor, it just wasn't quite my tempo.

It's difficult to see how this could go wrong, but it certainly did. I'm genuinely baffled by the reception of this film which has received awards, nominations, and a 7.2 rating on imdb. Quite frankly, this is a train-wreck - as a comedy it's painfully unfunny, as a serious depiction of political intrigue in the aftermath of Stalin's death/murder it falls completely on its face. The editing and camerawork works against the comedic timing, while the actors struggle with lines that are lost in a limbo between crazy comedy and dead seriousness. The scenes seem to follow each other randomly. It pains me to say it, because I think The Death of the Stalin had everything going for it, including a fascinating subject matter, but for me, this is bound to be THE movie-watching disappointment of 2019.",The Death of Stalin

It's a bunch of random psychobabbling throughout the entire movie; more than half of the stuff they say doesn't even make sense or have any contributing purpose.Instead of giving off a nice, dramatic irony effect, it comes off more as a ""cheeky"" old people squabbling film.

When he died suddenly, in 1953, with no obvious successor, it opened up a power vacuum, with high stakes, for both winners and losers. Armando Iannucci, best known for The Thick of It, transfers the power struggles of Westminster to the Soviet Union, with a similar mixture of inept and ruthless characters, bumbling uncertainty and vicious put-downs. A high calibre comic cast deliver the lines, with little regard for visual or aural accuracy, but which somehow still conveys an authentic sense of dark comedy and desperation. It did leave me with a wish to see a BBC4 type documentary, analysing the real events of this time, but Iannucci's script creates a dark comic version of them, without seeming exploitative.",The Death of Stalin

This movie takes understandable liberties, with the true history, for the sake of story telling. For instance the execution of Beria actually happened months after the death of Stalin. Some of the events were made up but totally plausible.The movie has moments of absurdity that act as a sort of apocryphal commentary on the obscenity and atrocity filled regime of the Stalin years.If this movie is propaganda it is only just, as it is more factual than not.

It has the biting satire and perfectly constructed slapstick of Armando Iannucci's other work, but it is quite different, narratively. There are no sympathetic characters, no naive protagonist for the viewer to empathise with and no emotionally engaging narrative arc. However, none of those omissions make it a bad film. In fact, I suspect that they are all deliberate. The film seeks to alienate the viewer, inspiring a kind of can't-look-away compulsion and repulsion with extreme violence and slapstick comedy placed side-by-side. This is irony on a grand scale, an ironic use of irony. Two days after seeing the film, I still haven't quite figured out if this works, but I've enjoyed and been challenged by the process of mulling it over, so I guess that means it did work?It has certainly stayed with me more than most films do, at least partly because of how accurate it is. Look up just about any of the events referred to in the film (not the dialogue, of course) and it turns out they are true or even UNDERSTATED. I can't outline those here without spoiling the film, but I would recommend that after watching it you look up Vasily Stalin and Lavrentiy Beria on Wikipedia and be prepared to be astonished and horrified.The performances are mostly top notch, with the characters all watchable despite their despicable nature.",The Death of Stalin

I don't look to this movie for historical perspective any more than David Irving would look to Life Is Beautiful for a deeper understanding of the Holocaust.Reagan once quipped that he couldn't get anywhere with the Russians because they kept dying on him. This movie has a similar problem. There are funny scenes that are Marx Brothers and Python-esque, but then it throws in the occasional mass murder and execution.That shouldn't deter anyone from watching it though.

A place where torture and murder are a normal occurrence, where paranoia stretches from the top officials to the common worker. Is there anything worse than a living Stalin? How about a dead Stalin? When a leader has such a tight death-grip on the nation, what happens when he suddenly lets go?This is the dilemma facing of the communist committee. While there are some who have let out a sigh of relief at Stalin's passing, there are others who start walking an even sharper knife edge. A massive power vacuum is left in his wake. In the chaos, top dogs like Khrushchev, Beria, Molotov, Malenkov are in precarious positions. The right moves can send you to the top, but in Soviet Russia. one mistake can also have you in the gulag or facing a firing squad. As they all scramble for power and influence only the toughest and most devious will survive. It's not long before the scheming and plotting starts, old habits, after all, are hard to break.The Death of Stalin is dark comedy. It tries - and sometimes succeeds - to depict the comedic ridiculousness and horrific terror of that time. It's an uncomfortable mix but maybe that's the point. You'll see brutal scenes with innocent people shot and murdered in street and yet you'll also meet a Stalin who has a distinct Manchester accent. It's jarring.

And I'm sure they objected to how such a formidable historical figure who was responsible for at least 20,000,000 deaths or many millions more could possibly be placed under the umbrella of humor. But if we look carefully, that may be the very point of the movie. Even historian Stephen Kotkin, who has written two huge volumes about Stalin, managed to say that he found parts of the movie hilarious, so even he would give us permission to find humor in the film, at least. It seems to me that the very essence of the film was not to make light of Stalin but to invite us in to the horror of that time in the USSR, perhaps a bait and switch to ease us into the awful realities that really existed. Had the movie been deadly serious, I doubt that many would have seen it.

A perfect movie that shows the idiocy that was going on in the Soviet Union and now, by extension, in Russia. Satire at its best. The cast and acting are superb. On par with Brazil, but unlike Brazil it is about what really happened. However ridiculous it might look, this is indeed how things were. Even factually the movie is true to the real history. All in all besides a note that a piano player sends to Stalin, the rest of the events in the movie were real, just might have happened not exactly in the sequence or points in time as they were depicted in the movie. You laugh a lot and do not feel ashamed to laugh at what was truly one of the most horrible periods of modern history. This is how Russians themselves related the events in form of anecdotes to each other (sort of gallows humor, but nevertheless humor). This attitude goes way back. Recall Saltykov-Schedrin's ""Chronicles of Glupov city"" that provided scathing commentary on Russian history going back to its inception. To those who don't know Soviet history and are not familiar with the characters it is not as easy to connect and enjoy the movie.

Apart from these folks, to be affected by movie dark and irreverent humour one has to be familiar with Soviet Union history and have some curiosity for its particulars, yet you don't mind to be offended by rude language, sexist jokes and graphic violence and death. Which narrows down the viewing audience to the title above. The current leftist crop of students in the First World, including US and Australia would be served well by watching this movie and then reading about the reality that it carefully and quite accurately caricatures.

With The Death of Stalin, he further cements his stature, bringing us a sharp political satire in a very sombre period of Russia's history. The Death of Stalin follows the power struggle between the council of ministers of the Soviet Union, giving us an insight of the regime's turmoil after Stalin's death. With an impressively intelligent script that balances the comedy and drama of the current affairs, Armando Iannucci makes us laugh, somewhat outrageously, in the midst of incredible violence, never presenting it as a foreground, but rather, a background painting, letting you decide what is depicted on off screen. 
 A stellar ensemble cast, which includes Steve Buscemi, Simon Russel Beale, Jeffrey Tambor, Jason Isaacs, just to a name a few, deliver, in near-perfect note, an outstanding array characters to full realisation. Impeccably casted and thoroughly well acted, the film breathes palpable life in every scene as the drama becomes increasingly apparent, providing a rousing third act that fully kills, literally, the beat from which the film started with.

The film never finds a focused voice, although it bounces back and forth between dry humor, absurdist dialogue, and dark hints of the murderous Soviet regime in the 1950's. It borrows elements from Monty Python, including a decent performance by Michael Palin. Jason Isaacs also plays a very believable and genuine Marshall Zhukov. The film has the sweetened version of a deathly tyranny as in Hogan's Heroes. But, it doesn't bring these elements together in a unified way. To this American viewer, the humor never reaches a very high level of achievement- not even as high as MASH. The references to the oppression of the Soviet Cold War era are dark but done in a muted way that don't convey the deathly pall of life in that era. The film masquerades as a comedy, but it doesn't fully develop as one. It lingers between weak humor and weak terror.

The best part was easily the performances. Each actor plays their part spectacularly and it feels like you're actually watching these people rather than just characters in a film. The plot, while confusing at times, also seems really consistent. My main problems with the film are the somewhat unsatisfying conclusion and that Steve Buscemi suffers from what I like to call ""famous actor syndrome"" (i.e. when a famous actor plays a character, you always just see/hear the actor instead of the character they're portraying), but other than that, this film is almost perfect.

233,calvintoronto,Not really a satire but an apt and very dark history (with very dark humour),9,21 June 2020,"I don't understand how this might be termed a parody or a satire. It is neither.That people around Stalin bumbled is actually no surprise. Certainly, the film is often depicted in very darkly humorous tones; but such humour is wrought from actual history -- and so there is nothing here that is, in the end, satiric or parodic. And this is what makes the film oddly funny -- you cannot but be appalled and wide-eyed at the bumbling -- and the deadly serious, often at the same time. Stalin's USSR was a horror show. You could be randomly shot for no reason (other than Stalin or some higher-up ordered it). Life was precarious, to say the least.In one scene, a police force is taking over from another, and it's pandemonium. What is going on, exactly? The script intentionally leaves you guessing. And just as the scene wraps up and you think the craziness is over, one man who appears to be in charge and has triumphed, is shot point blank; and there the scene ends. The Keystone Kops cacaphony shifts registers, to something so horrific and seemingly arbirtrary that you get pulled every which way. It's unsettling, and therein lies the film's brillance.It helps to do a bit of reading beforehand to understand which character is motivated by what. Regardless, the film is self-contained. The standout here is Simon Russell Beale as the predatory Baria. It is what would in lesser hands be a thankless role of ""the bad guy."" And he is indeed a bad guy. But Beale plays him so well that the character is never less than fascinating in his aggressive repulsiveness. (He does such a good job that he somewhat overshadows the movie.)Michael Palin is excellent as well, as are the test of the cast. I was expecting more from Tambor, though; he underplayed the role, I thought. The only casting I would have changed was Buscemi. He's likely the reason people find the movie a parody, because Buscemi is often associated with it. Here, his character is actually trying (and often failing) to be the funny guy. But as the cunning Khrushchev, well, no, there doesn't appear to be any cunning there; rather, Buscemi plays the part as a man who is just trying to avoid getting caught up in the fracas. This strikes me as unfortunately incorrect.Note: A comparison, in terms of its dark humour: Todd Solondz's Happiness.",The Death of Stalin

The story does manage to convey the sense of fear and paranoia that was ripe in Russia at the time of Stalin's regime. The darker scenes of the film that depict the murder of innocent people and the abuse of children do stick with you as a viewer. The Game of Thrones-esque power struggles between the members of the Soviet Union after Stalin's death are equally hilarious and tense as witness every power move certain members make against each other.The standout performance for me was Jason Isaac's portrayal of Zhukov.

238,dirty_chords,"Dark, timely satire",8,9 March 2018,"The Death of Stalin is one of the best political satires I've seen in years.Iannucci, at the top of his game, creates parallels between Stalin's totalitarian regime and present Russia (cult of personality, Putinism), as well as the actions of Trump administration. The appearance of -previously persecuted- Orthodox bishops at Stalin's funeral offers a brief glimpse into the country's future. The slowly changing attitude towards them, let alone the Central Committee members' eagerness to promote liberal reforms, proves that ideologies are just a disguice for political opportunism. That said, the central characters of the story are the epitome of pragmatic cynicism.Steve Buscemi is great. Jason Isaacs is a scene stealer. Simon Russell Beale is the MVP: His portrayal of the NKVD head, Lavrentiy Beria, who is a dangerous sociopath (his awful actions are extremely hard to digest) with an everlasting desire for political power, is nothing sort of spectacular.The pacing is top notch. Comic timing does wonders; no doubt Iannucci has an unique sardonic sense of humor. The movie is absolutely hilarious and shocking at the same time. In a nutshell, ""The Death of Stalin"" is as good as a dark political satire can go.",The Death of Stalin
239,cjfrasure,"A Shakespearean Take, Masterfully Executed",8,26 July 2020,"A talent rich cast delivers some of the smartest dialogue of the year in a darkly comedic storytelling romp through history.It's one of those dark comedies where you catch yourself giggling through some of the most horrific acts and monstrous deeds that you should feel icky, but you don't have time before the next round of shenanigans takes off.This flick is smart and it doesn't pander or condescend and yet it's somehow not stuffy or aloof either. But it is dry. A dry, serious, deadpan, hilarious look at a tragic era for so many.These characters aren't likeable, with only a couple exceptions. They aren't sympathetic and you're left trying to maybe gin up enough humanity to pull for the least despicable among them.There are several noteworthy individual performances, but the synergistic momentum stand way out. Also the sets and scenes had a hyper-realistic style that more than carried its own water.After all that gushing, it's obvious that this movie won't be seen everyone's cup of tea.

From the delicious musical prelude to the never tiring running joke about the accents to the evil Beria whose evil is only highlighted by the absurdities surrounding his attempt to seize power. Monty Python would have been proud but even the great python never dug this deep into human absurdity.Yes. It can't help but be topical. Can't help but demonstrate the difference between an extremely ruthless tough rather power-mad, but ultimately competent leader (Khrushchev played brilliantly by Steve Buscemi) and the idiots running certain large powerful countries today.But if you like black humor and dark comedies, this may be one of the best ever put on screen.",The Death of Stalin

As a descendant of someone who suffered under Soviet communism (farm collectivised, friends dragged off, etc), and sensitive to how revisionist history sometimes dulls the edges of evil, I was very curious as to how this crazy, fearful time would be presented. How do you make the terror that Solzhenitsyn expressed so passionately, funny?The performances are top notch - from Beria to Zhukov, the cast were amazing; Michael Palin was good as Molotov (as he chose to play him), although the way he characterized him I disagree with. The humour comes in seeing these brutal and merciless men terrorized by their own fear of what could happen and knowledge that they could be next on the list, (in fact, Molotov's wife was in prison as a traitor). Seeing these men nervous, fawning, scheming and obsessing over things was funny, because the script was clever and managed to preserve the absurdity and callousness of the Soviet regime whilst showing the duplicity, machinations and plotting against each other. The egos were preserved, the desire to criticise and use anything as a way to climb up way was shown, and even though you knew they were real people, it was hard to feel sorry for any of them, seeing and knowing what they did.It is a rare movie, in that it took a terrible time, made a dark comedy, yet didn't sugar coat things but pulled you in. The dialogue, quips and chemistry between all the stars were terrific, and I actually laughed loudly at Jason Issacs' portrayal of Zhukov; it was brilliant, and shows what a talented actor he is (Lucius Malfoy as a Soviet general? IT WORKS.) Buschemi had a lot of depth playing Khrushchev, another great performance by him. See it - I guarantee it won't be what you expect but it will be worth your time!

250,RunRabbitRun87,Armando Iannucci channels his inner Chekov,9,24 October 2017,"Director Armando Iannucci is always able to convey that ego and misunderstanding can derail even the best political intentions, often to the point where it's a miracle that nation- states can function at all. While the comic potential of these mishaps is evident in the democracies of the United Kingdom and the USA, where Iannucci has previously focused his political satire, bringing it to the horrendous crimes of Stalinist Russia may be an entirely different challenge.In 1953 Stalin suffers a stroke, and head of the NKVD secret police Laventry Beria (Simon Russell Beale) moves quickly to cement his position and stick the reformist Nikita Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi) with the funeral arrangements.Soon both are courting favour from political mainstays such as Georgy Malenkov (Jeffrey Tambor) and Vyacheslav Molotov (Michael Palin) while trying to contain Stalin's drunken son Vasily (Rupert Friend).It is a great achievement that Iannucci is able to see the comic absurdity in the atrocities of the NKVD (precursor to the KGB), and in the terrifying power wielded by a tiny cabal of aging men.Whilst for those of us whose A Level studies left us with a rough grasp of the events unfolding, it would take greater expertise to pick out every historical aberration in this film. It is a film that provides great fun for people with zero knowledge of Soviet history, keeping the viewer in genuine suspense as to who will succeed Stalin and how.With such ego and dogmatism, the politicians of Stalin's Russia share unnerving similarities with the leaders of today.This is an ensemble cast, with brilliant acting performances across the board. A standout is Jason Isaacs as the fêted General Zhukov. He is supremely self-confident, sharp and wickedly funny. Simon Russell Beale is known more for his stage work, yet is more than able to hold his own alongside the cinematic talent. Beria is a man of great evil, and that Beale is able to incorporate a comedy into the role is a mastery of writing and performance. This downfall of a sexual deviant could not come at a more apt time for Hollywood.Production design is another highlight of the film. Physical comedy and moving from room to room may entertain the eye, but the ensuring that the air of 50s Russia is consistent is also essential. The shots of the Kremlin and Red Square are suitably lavish, while the headquarters of the NKVD have the feel of a dungeon on steroids.There are a couple of 'Thick of It' moment set-pieces that are downright hilarious. What comes to mind are Comrade Andryev (Paddy Considine) forced to immediately repeat a concert performance for Stalin's leisure, and Khrushchev trying to negotiate a coup and a state funeral at the same time.Iannucci has reteamed with writer Ian Martin with whom he has worked on ""The Thick of It"" and ""Veep"", and ""The Death Of Stalin"" retains that same crudity and escalating nonsense. David Schnieder has been brought on board, a writer with experience of Soviet-set material from his play ""Making Stalin Laugh"", about the massacre of the Moscow State Jewish Theatre troupe in 1952.There is also an undercurrent of subversion not seen since Iannucci worked with Chris Morris, seen not least in the absurd dedication of soldiers and politicians in an attempt to save their own skin. While the politicians of the West have long since been knocked from their pedestal, all strands of comedy in ""The Death of Stalin"" carry a certain mischievous undercurrent in the knowledge that many humourless Russians will detest it.A single point of criticism is perhaps that Beria's collapse happens a bit too suddenly. At one moment he seems to hold all the cards, the next he's desperately unleashing his rage on close compatriots.Just as Nolan shifted his output with Dunkirk and delivered one of his best works, Iannucci has moved timeframe and political atmosphere to create a phenomenal satire. One death is a tragedy unless it's ""The Death of Stalin"".",The Death of Stalin
251,dan-902-916137,"Disappointing, unrelentingly bleak",5,29 October 2017,"Have been looking forward to this for nearly a year, as a big Iannucci fan. Unfortunately the grimness of the subject is not matched by the somewhat lame farce, so although it has the shape of a comedy I never actually laughed until Paul Whitehouse made a little throwaway comment in the final scene.I don't agree with other reviewers here that a serious subject cannot form the basis of a comedy. It has been done successfully many times (what could be more serious than terrorism? And yet see Four Lions). Nor do I want to add my voice to a few Russian reviewers claiming that this is insulting propaganda, or is inaccurate to any meaningful degree - how can anyone defend Stalin, or pretend that it is unrealistic to depict him as a habitual murderer? Unfortunately the film is rooted in horrible fact, though we may ""bicker and argue about who killed who"", as Michael Palin once said.But nevertheless while the film had every possibility and expectation of working on some level, what attempts at humour there were mostly fell flat, while the attempt to be funny seemed sacrilegious against such an horrific real life backdrop. Had the jokes worked, it might not have seemed so ill-judged. A lame joke seems more tasteless than a good one.",The Death of Stalin

It is more than the sum of its parts, parts which include the afore mentioned and: Iannucci's obsession with human mortality, a script that's breathlessly full of of mordant one liners, and unbelievable situations, based on reality, brought alive by the perfect timing of a, truly, impeccable ensemble cast.

It really made me feel like I was watching a Monty Python. Infact Michael Palin (Molotov) was a member of Monty Python.One should also point out that the selection of the actors is beyond spectacular. Simon Russell Beale (Beria) and Jason Isaacs (Zhukov) almost stole the every scene they acted. Jeffrey Tambor's (Malenkov) performance was also brilliant and should be praised as well.The last thing about I would like to point out that Steve Buscemi (Khrushchev) might be the last person you would expect to play this role yet he absolutely nailed it.",The Death of Stalin
255,riethc,An historical drama with a funny bone!,8,9 April 2018,"Part comedy, part historical drama, The Death of Stalin is a strong candidate for picture of the year. With a story based on a French graphic novel, this biting satire blends historical realism with comedy in just the right doses, placing it well above the fantasy escapism that has taken hold of much of the film industry.The majority of The Death of Stalin centers around the bickering of Stalin's stooges as they attempt to outmaneuver each other at the USSR's Central Committee. While the film's running time is 104 minutes, it takes its time to introduce the audience to the Soviet Union under the real life Man of Steel's reign. It only moves to Stalin's demise after we realize that the USSR is an old boys club gone mad, held together by the literal and figurative skeletons in the Committee's closet and a reign of terror stemming from the USSR's secret police and Stalin himself.The scheming in the wake of Stalin's death further demonstrates how a country can essentially become a functional dystopia, if there be a strongman in place. But after Stalin croaks, the film goes on to further show how a ruthless cabal can turn in on itself, with ultimately only the guns of the nation's soldiers providing stability.The main morale seems to be that undemocratic governments need force at the highest levels to hold themselves together, particularly during precarious moments such as succession of leadership. In a society that gives up democratic checks and balances, the legitimacy of its rule is easily questioned and often gives off a sense of looming chaos, with the possibility of mayhem erupting. (Without giving too much away, mayhem does erupt at points under the Committee's mismanagement.)My only nitpick about the film is the casting. Steve Buscemi is an odd fit for Nikiti Khrushchev and Jeffrey Tambor unfortunately does not fulfill the role of a complicated coward like the Deputy Chairman Georgy Malenkov, besides other than posing with the right facial expressions at key moments. Although Buscemi puts on an excellent performance, he's not stretching his acting repertoire by any means. Because of this, it's difficult not to see him as much more than a competent, Sovietized version of Mr. Pink. (Sorry, Steve. Don't blame me. Blame Hollywood typecasting.) Ironically, Buscemi may have been a better fit for the Malenkov role. If the Buscemi and Tambo had exchanged roles, the realism of the film may have been heightened to a degree and as long as Tambor could have pushed the Khrushchev role further than he did with Malenkov, it may have been an excellent performance on both parts.*What The Death of Stalin succeeded best in is at showing us continuity in human affairs. While I don't want to add any spoilers to this review for anyone going in without knowing the history of the Soviet Union, the scheming in Moscow didn't end with Malenkov's or (later) Khrushchev's eventual succession. Anyone with a sufficient knowledge of recent Russian history know that this palace court intrigue continues on even into today.*This may not have been a fault of the actors themselves since it's impossible to know what was left on the film's cutting room floor.",The Death of Stalin

I think a lot of people will enjoy this movie maybe except for little kids or even teenagers because they might not know whats going on since it does have a lot of jokes that are built on Russia and if you don´t history very well the movie might get a bit boring after awhile. Also some little children might not like the movie since it has some swearing and in some ways it can also seem a bit brutal.I personally enjoyed the movie since you had a laugh ever 30 seconds or so.

Thirdly: this made me laugh out loud at least five times during it's run-time.

Some people might find it offensive that they are portrayed as quite funny and engaging characters. But I think Iannucci does such a good job reminding the audience of the nature of these people that he keeps a balance and really succeeds with this movie. Very enjoyable.

This treatment may well attract a wider audience, to discover a period in time they may not have known about, than if it was just presented as a bleak dark history with nothing to relieve the grimness. It's an interesting experiment and it is taking a risk. I imagine it may attract some criticism for this, but I found it very interesting and absorbing. It's not ""laugh out loud"" humour generally but when I saw it in the cinema, it was full, and I did hear some laughter but mostly the audience seemed absorbed.

Thus it would be nice to know who they were before viewing. Secondly, if you are faint of heart when it comes to political correctness, either don't watch this movie at all, or don't complain that something insulted you. This is a political satire about one of the most brutal dictators in history. Executions will be depicted in a light manner, as will massive arrests, and the overbearing police-state.

Central to the humour is the fact that Stalin's repression left everyone terrified, even the members of the Politburo, who are adept at instantly reversing their position on any subject, at any time.Simon Russell Beale does a wonderful job as the utterly amoral Berya, but I think three actors stand out even more: Jeffrey Tambor as the magnificently indecisive Malinkov, Steve Buscemi as a scheming but oddly principled Krushchev, and in particular Jason Isaacs as the straight talking, take-no-prisoners Field Marshal Zhukov.In addition to being tremendously funny, it is also an excellent history lesson and a peek at what repression was like under the Soviets.",The Death of Stalin

The only seats left were for the 10:35 showing. So I went to an AMC theater -- the only other venue where it was playing in NYC -- and purchased the last non-disabled seat.I walked out about an hour into the ""Look everyone, this is funny!"" production, approximately fifty more minutes than I should have. I need to take better care of my time. This is the perfect film for people who will either enthusiastically or disingenuously laugh at anything that you tell them is funny. Speaking of which, there was plenty of forced laughter which, given the material, might have been the only options. But there were also large swaths of the audience that remained silent for the time I put myself through involuntary and despairing memories of Gilligan's Island. There is nothing sophisticated or intellectually challenging about what little comedy there is. If you're into reading between the lines, then all you'll see is a blank screen. Which, now that I about it, might be worthy competition. This is at best a straight-to-DVD production that would otherwise only provoke something other than anemic, self-conscious laughter with the introduction of vast amounts of cannabis.Whether you value your time, your money, or both, it's simply not worth it. And when you do go and you get that impulse to leave, do it.",The Death of Stalin

On the bright side, I really like the photography, makeup and costumes. Good work there. 
On the not-so-bright side, I was not convinced with the choices of the director with regards to the acting and script. The English/American regional accents did not make sense for this movie. The dialogue was not believable in a Russian seeing. I could not believe the Russian oligarchs would act like a bunch of teen-agers at the dinner in the opening scenes. Zero suspension of disbelief!

286,Andeddu,The hysteria of the time captured quite well.,9,12 January 2020,"As almost satirical it may have looked, the uncertainty and almost panic among Stalin's cronies was fairly accurate.
I was impressed with how Buscemi carried the role of Khrushchev. Beale did an amazing job of making you hate Lavrentiy Beria even more, if that was possible. The only problem I had was that Molotov was depicted as timid and emotional, when that was the exact opposite of how ""Old stone ass"" carried himself. Of the questions I had, the only one that's bugging me is, where was Voroshilov? He was instrumental in bringing Beria down. Was the decision to not have him in it because he was not in Moscow when Stalin died? That because it was several months before they tried Beria?",The Death of Stalin

288,mistermclazo,"""The Death of Stalin"" - A Brilliant, Dark and Raunchy Political Comedy",9,2 July 2018,"The Death of Stalin is stupid and dark. It knows that it's stupid and dark, which just adds to its brilliance. Armando Iannucci is a genius, and he really shines in making such a raunchy, yet brilliant picture. It always contrasts the violence and disgust of Russia with the comedy and bleak humor of the council, but never downplays either of them. It follows a large council of Russian officials fighting for power after the general secretary, Stalin, dies from a cerebral hemorrhage.This film flaunts itself as a ultra-dark comedy. The officials are all terrible people, but the villains are also terrible, so in a brilliant twist, Iannucci leaves you wondering who to root for. Even the main character is an awful, terrible character who uses human lives and destruction as a shield and uses death as a device to blame other things on other people. He's a control freak with a witty personality, but we still like him.Steve Buscemi was wonderful in the role of Khrushchev, and made the character so funny and likable. Simon Beale was Beria, who was the general 'villain'. He was hilarious, and he was very intimidating. Both Rupert Friend and Andrea Riseborough were great, and really did play off each other like quarreling siblings. Jason Isaacs has got to be the funniest character however. He's absolutely hilarious in his mannerisms and his joking nature. A standout performance by Jeffrey Tambor was presented too. He plays Georgy Malenkov, the new premier, and is very funny in his ineptitude. Other perfect performances were presented by Adrian McLoughlin, Ogla Kurylenko, Paul Whitehouse, Paul Chahidi, Dermot Crowley and James BarriscaleIf you want a rousing experience with fabulous performances, black comedy, and great and memorable scenes, this is a must see.

290,camarshall-36934,You'll have to dig very gravely for the comedy gold....,3,21 October 2017,"Armando Iannucci has a reputation for comedy gold but, in my opinion, his gold definitely appears tarnished with this production.Despite having high production values and a wonderful cast, this film struggles to raise a cynical smirk. The cinema auditorium remained deathly silent - perhaps in embarrassment - not knowing quite what to make of this very uneven piece of work. Perhaps it was the way that the film lurched between Stalin's victims ears full of blood and the sporadic sound of shooting and an uninspired slapstick carrying of Stalin's ailing body that left the audience unsure of how to react. Whatever the reason, it didn't work. Simon Russell Beale excels as the casually evil Beria, but Michael Palin - who normally steals any scene - lacks his usual mischievous waspishness. Even they can't rescue this dark drama. The settings are very convincing, however. With uncertainty and few laughs, this ill-conceived concept failed to grab my interest and became only the second film that I have walked out of after an hour during the last fifteen years. It felt wrong to laugh during the violence.Tarantino and Bond are one genre - that is fictional violence and gore. Ultimately I felt that it was offensive to try to create laughs over a background of terror, torture and murder that actually happened and was an appalling time for humanity. What next.

Performances of note Steve Buscemi as the paranoid Khrushchev, Jason Isaacs as the uncompromising Zhukov (with unexpected yet hilarious northern accent) and Simon Russel as the head of the NKVD who scared me just watching him.

There were a few funny scenes and some funny lines and things, but not nearly enough for me to feel like it was worth it to spend my time watching this movie. I have no interest in history or Stalin or anything like that. I couldn't identify with any of the characters. They were all nuts. I couldn't wait for this movie to end.
On the plus side, I did like how the movie was made in general...no fake accents -- all the actors spoke in their natural manner whether they were American or British or whatever.

302,Yngwie_Wittevrongel,The Red Doctor Strangelove,8,15 July 2018,"To start off this is one of the best movies i've seen in a while.
It's a fresh breath when it comes down to movies about history and Russia as a whole. Not that there are this many movies about Jozef Stalin or the Red army and their period in history.
It instantly showed us the fear people had for and the power Stalin had.
Some visual gags like men falling off the stairs in the background etc. actually made me giggle a bit, slapstick has been dead for a while yet in this amount it worked.
The movie gave ma Doctor Strangelove feeling when it came down to the comedy and laughing about a serious topic.
As a movie fanatic I could never have imagined a movie about Stalin his (surprising) natural death to be this funny.
It's not a stupid Adam Sandler esc. comedy but a well written smart dark-comedy.
The costumes and acting performances delivered by the respected actors are phenomenal. I think that the best thing is that for the first time in my memory Steve Buscemi doesn't die in this movie.
It's funny how overacting can sometimes work in this movie, it's well established how Stalin his ""Friends"" are scared of him and this gets them in some hilarious shenanigans for the first half of the movie.
As for the writing it's great, some clever banter as they struggle to get his body out of the room.
This tone continues for the rest of the movie.

308,zulfiakarimova,disappointing ideological distortion of history,1,22 October 2017,"I have been waiting for this film for a long time and I was really disappointed when I finally watched in at the cinema. I thought that it was extremely stereotypical to the point of silliness. A comedy is supposed to be funny and slightly silly, that is the rule of the genre, but not to the extent that it is just not funny any more and just silly and offensive.There are many distortions of historical facts in the film. It would be good if the script writers could have familiarized themselves with historical events before writing the script. One can say that as a film and not a documentary the film does not have to reflect historical facts accurately. However, it is a matter of ethical standards as in this film historical events are distorted from a certain ideological view point rather than just as a fantasy of artistic imagination.The film is hugely ideological. At the time when negative image of Russia prevails in politics and in the media, how ethical is it to create another propagandist and hugely ideologically engaged film depicting a very traumatic period of Russian history in the most humiliating, diminishing and untruthful way?The makers of the film are hugely insensitive to the values and ideals of Russian people. I think that anybody who wants to make a film about a foreign country should have some respect for the country. Marshall Zhukov is immensely respected and loved by Russian people and I find it unacceptable to depict him as a brutal murderer.The film is a comedy, a completely distorted historical narrative, comics, a film resembling comedy animation with simplistic and caricature characters. It is a mixture of genres and this makes the film inconsistent. All these genres do not fit comfortably with each other.The style of the film is close to comics. There is nothing that would give depth to the film, no building characters around archetypes, nor relation between the inward subconscious dreamlike reality and the outside world, no allusions to other literary works and/or historical events. It is just a straightforward simplistic comics narrative. At times it is boring and repetitive and not funny at all. The film also shows exaggerated bizarre sequence of senseless murders. This could have never happened historically. The genre of comics may justify it but again behind the facade of the rules of the genre there is a simple ideological message that is to depict Russia not only negatively but also in a humiliating, diminishing and almost bullying way. As a Russian myself, I find the film hugely offensive.",The Death of Stalin

310,Anti-Fascist,I can't wait for the sequel!,10,24 February 2018,"It's sad that so few Soviet Union or modern Russia -related movies have been made recently. Movie makers must be scared of Putin's revenge, there is no other explanation. The country offers a plentiful source of script ideas, yet very few movies dare to touch the subject.This is even more peculiar considering that Russia is waging a massive cyberwar campaign against the west, yet the west doesn't fight back in any way. Movies like this should be made more to give Russians some food for thought...This satire is of course not totally accurate historically, and it doesn't have to be, it's a satire! It's not a documentary! However, it's probably much more accurate than brainwashed Russians would think! Putin has been glorifying Stalin a lot lately and many Russians don't consider Stalin as a bad guy anymore. Of course they think that this movie is just ""western propaganda"" and not true at all.Quite telling is that the movie has been banned in Russia.

The one major flaw is that the atmosphere is not Russian, it is more like if a tyranny would have befallen on English soil. Let me explain. Khrushchev is something of a prankster of the group, a slim agitated guy and has nothing to do with the real indeed funny but bear-like and strong willed politician. Beria is played by a fat guy while the real one was slim and intellectual. The way Molotov was portrayed reminded me of Neville Chamberlain or Antony Eden, he seems a lord with communist convictions. Malenkov the stupid is again excessive, even if suits the story well. The starting point, though clever is obviously surreal. Only the pianist sees clearly how tyrannic Stalin is and has the suicidal courage to send him a letter, even if she knows that means death, This seems exaggerated, given her young age she would have been victim of the usual brain washing strategies portraying Stalin as the father of the nation.. The authors ignore the real scope of the terror in those days URSS, even if some of Beria's conversations do give some sense of how frightening was to live in that time.

315,mjgmh,"Well Written and Engaging, but a Strange Take on a Deadly Era",8,29 August 2021,"THE DEATH OF STALIN
MG FILM REVIEW
29 Aug 2021Strange take on a deadly era. Well written, but there was just a bit too much slapstick from my perspective, especially when the people surrounding Stalin feared for their lives every second.The concert scene at the start was a humorous, well done, and reasonable take on the fear, obsequiousness, and uncertainty of the time, as I understand that period. The actors do a very nice job in this opening scene, especially the one who portraying the Director of Radio Moscow.And, throughout the movie, your heart goes out to the everyday person (musicians, concert audience members, Stalin's house-keeping staff, and the common soldier) just quietly trying to survive amid the terror and insanity. Watch the faces of the concert's audience members for the indicators ... especially the second bewildered group, suddenly yanked off the street to fill empty spots ... nicely done.Despite any levity or satire, though, the viewer must always remember that there was absolutely nothing endearing about any of the Soviet leaders during the Stalinist era ... they all had blood on their hands.The number of Stalin's victims, based in part on declassified Soviet records, are conservatively estimated at between 10-20 million. Russian author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn estimated that Stalin was responsible for upwards of 60 million deaths.It was interesting to watch the main Politburo members vie for power. Steve Buscemi plays an amped up version of Nikita Khrushchev, the eventual Russian Premier 1956-1964.Beria, Stalin's NKVD Chief at the time, is featured prominently in this film. Although it wasn't in the movie, Beria once told Stalin during one of the many purges, 'Show me the man, and I'll show you the crime.' Beria was despicable; he was a filthy, blood thirsty sadist, rapist and serial-killer.The actor's rotund appearance does not come close to Beria's slight stature, although his mania is more apparent, especially at the end.While Stalin was in a coma, Beria maneuvered intently for power, defaming Stalin verbally. Then, when Stalin briefly regained consciousness with minimal lucidity a few times, before finally expiring, Beria praised Stalin to his face. This was only touched on in the film.And, Michael Palin seems comfortable as Vyacheslav Molotov from Monty Python. Molotov was the Soviet Foreign Minister 1939-1949 and 1953-1956. Molotov assisted Stalin in the negotiations of the notorious 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Hitler and Stalin that was used to divide Poland. The pact was abrogated when Hitler invaded the USSR in June 1941.Molotov's role in this film is questionable. He was on the outs with Stalin around the time of Stalin's death. He's probably in the film due to a an interesting side story about Stalin's 1948 prison sentence of Molotov's wife, Polina, for 'treason'. And, she was forced to accept a divorce from Molotov.After Stalin's death, Beria may have freed Polina from prison and restored her to her husband. The scene as shown in this film, while touching, seemed contrived. Not sure, the historical record supports this, and I'd welcome additional details from a real academic on this point. Typical of the time, Molotov continued supporting Stalin despite Stalin's exile of his wife.Another interesting side story is that of Stalin's daughter, Svetlana, who later defected to the US in the 1960's while on a visit to India. His other child, a son, was a worthless drunk and braggart; his personality is well depicted in this film.Wonder why the film-makers opted for a satirical or comedic approach? Probably for today's viewership, I suppose, although I would have preferred a straight drama. I can only surmise that this choice was meant as a critique, in a way that was reminiscent of the novel by Soviet satirist Mikhail Bulgakov, 'The Master and Margarita' that was also set during the Stalinist era.On the 100 year anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, 1917-2017, utopian socialist totalitarians accounted for upwards of 100 million deaths and data is still coming in. The list includes, but is not limited to: Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Khieu Samphan, Che, Castro, etc, along with the 'National Socialists' Mussolini & Hitler.Why don't our schools teach all the atrocities of all the 20th century's totalitarians who relied more and more on murder to maintain power as reality and the human spirit refused to adapt to the totalitarians' sterile, godless 'scientific theories'?That era was, after all, predicted by the German philosopher Fredrick Nietzsche and the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevski.To quote the Dostoyevski: 'If God does not exist, everything is permitted.' The Soviet Union was an atheistic society ... and any Stalinist atrocity was permitted.",The Death of Stalin

Just a few physical gags made smile, but everything in the dialogue seemed like it was written by a kid. This film tried too much to be funny, when there was nothing to laugh about. I really love dark humour, in the Coen brothers style, but all of the ""jokes"" in this film were just so lazy and lame, and the swearing just didn't fit in. I mean, who laughs when someone says ""camel cock""? Who laughs when someone tries to decide wheter a call happened 10 seconds ago or 30 seconds ago? What?And what really bothered me was that every character seemed to be the same. All of them just rambling on and on and on. It was just one character they wrote with different names. The actors tried but when the script is bad, it's bad.Why is every critic so blindly praising this? Is it because they think ""it must be great because it was directed by a guy who wrote these other great comedies"" or because ""it dares to make fun of dark subject matter and it laughs at russians"". If a dark comedy was made of Hitler and his genocide, it would be banned in Germany as this was in Russia. And it might not get such approval as this film.",The Death of Stalin

I don't know how he does it. I spent years in American politics and I am embarrassed to admit that Veep is by far the most accurate political satire ever made. Death of Stalin provides the same treatment to post-war Stalinist Russia, a period that could not be more perfectly conveyed than through the lens of Iannucci's absurdist vision.

321,mauricemain-12149,Ham fisted and confused.,4,31 August 2018,"I am taking the time to add my two cents regarding the failings of this film, because it was so appallingly inept, in it's writing and direction, that I consider it an insult to the vast wealth of talent who invested themselves, too trustingly in a ponzi scheme of incompetence, and idiocy, where everybody loses. As someone not from the UK, I had not heard of Armando Ianucci, and after viewing this film, I can understand why. I had seen ""In The Loop"", almost a decade ago, and admit to being mightily disappointed in that effort, because it had been spruiked as a clever, satiric, political comedy, and failed to deliver on the promise, most miserably. 
Now again, much was promised, an IMDB rating above 7, should indicate a movie of at least tolerable quality, and certainly not the pathetically urbane depiction of mass murder and inhuman terror like an out take from a Benny Hill sketch. In fact the only pathetic hackneyed comedy ploy he did not assault us with was Stalin, rapidly patting secret police chief Berias bald head, or chasing Molotov around the park with a pistol, to the Benny Hill theme. I very nearly gave up, and considered walking out, which is something I never do, but the first half of the film was so weak, that a One Star rating would have been generous for what had been delivered. Thankfully I stayed, and the film had so much historical content to try and squeeze in, that the director had to back off on his indulgent attempts at broad humour that may have been some misguided attempted homage to Pythonism, or God knows what other slapstick styles, he may have been alluding to. The resultant mishandling of the material, poorly written as it was, did give way to a more comprehensible narrative attempt as the film lurched to it's climax. Perhaps this is symptomatic of a world where indulging stupidity and folly deserves to be parodied. Stalinism was most certainly a loathesome period in history more deserving of ridicule than most, but precious little humour is to be found in terror, despotism and mass murder, and was most definitely beyond the talents of Mr Ianucci's pen. A more worthy subject for parody would be the hierarchy that supported the making of such an unworthy artistic effort. That is something I find truly funny, to think of the self important imbeciles that provided millions of dollars to make this farcically poor attempt at a farce.",The Death of Stalin

Every scene, every nuance, even every extra is right on cue. Extraordinary! How he managed to bring laughter to this subject is nothing short of brilliant. Still, he doesn't downplay the brevity of the subject matter but goes deep inside for a genuine look at what happens in such a situation, we have all been to funerals where in spite of our best intentions comedy bubbles up in those awkward moment simply because it is our human nature to stumble over those dark times in our lives as family and friends merge. Imagine that now with the death of someone like Stalin - the power play with his cabinet members, secret service, the army, the whole situation at hand as family, ""friends,"" and all the multitudes of terrified and worshiping masses, uncertain of what is ahead, come together to pay their ""respect.""

The character portrayal is one of the many details that makes the movie extraordinary. Their introduction adds a hint of poetry to the comedy and by far the one that stands out is Marshal Zhukov's - no detail of his first appearance was left unpolished: from the scar on his face which highlights his harshness to the movement of the medals on his suit which draw the scales of his portrayal into ridicule. These portraits of the people in Stalin's life (and death) build up a chain of metaphors for the traits of his regime and its consequences: from the blind followers who abide by his every word, to the fickle ones, ready at all times to compromise in order to grab hold of his power; and from the idealists (of both sides) to the moralists who compromise for personal benefits.

329,Mark_Kral,Mixed Experience,7,11 February 2019,"The film is a contemporary Anglicized version of a dark comedy of a Soviet historical event. It is funny and biting satire and farce, but one can also understand why Russians would feel offended by its oversimplification and stereotyping. It could be said that Stalin and his goons don't deserve better but there is an unease about trashing another country's past like that. Stalin is an easy target - one can certainly see how, if the roles were reversed, and Russians would make a film about... let's say Bush, the outcry would be immense. Still, if one can bracket that discussion, the resulting film is enjoyable, and I don't think it's a bad thing to ridicule the world's politicians and dictators - if anything, we need more satire like this for our current political goons and absurdist reality.",The Death of Stalin

Steve Buscemi as Kruschev probably held the film together but there was a brilliant minor role for Jason Isaacs as Marshal Zhukov.

Pulp Fiction is another somewhat sick violent comedy but in comparison it's a Disney cartoon movie. The fact that so many people think this is 7+ stars is scary and says something about the mindset of a sick society. Just my two cents.

334,edmundosullivan,Caught between comedy. tragedy and fact,8,21 December 2020,"Brilliantly written, performed and produced, Death of Stalin is definitely worth watching but left me bemused nevertheless. It at least implies it's essentially factual and yet every scene is a distortion. Beria was not executed immediately after Stalin's funeral but more than nine months later. This divergence from fact drives every minute of the film. The trailer suggests the film's a comedy with dark overtones. In fact, it's consistently horrifying an includes a depiction of Stalin's degrading death and post-mortem; Beria's abuse (including sexual assault), torture and murder. The film attempts to pack in far too much, involving far too many characters - Stalin, Beria, Malenkov, Molotov, Kruschev, Mikoyan, Svetlana Stalin, Vassily Statin and Zhukov are the main ones. There's about half a dozen secondary ones. The punchlines are often excellent, but delivered too fast (to get them all in?) and often not clearly. The editing is tight. All told, this means it's hard to follow, even for Soviet history buffs. Death of Stalin is political theatre that would have worked brilliantly on the stage. Buscemi is superb and I loved Michael Palin, Simon Russell, Paul Whitehouse, Jeffery Tambour, Consadine, Friend and Isaacs. It deserved to be at least two hours long not 107 minutes. I guess the producers were (rightlly) unnerved at the prospect of launching a long film full of foreign actors about an obscure moment in history 75 years ago.

Well, I don't mean to be rude, but you do a political satire about something that really bothers you, not about 70 year old event that has nothing to do with your and lives of your friends and family. Why was The Great Dictator so good? Well, because it was a movie about America in fact. Ianucci didn't learn this lesson. His style is too superficial, and too silly for these kind of tragedies. Maybe he wanted to make a black comedy (although I don't believe so), but the movie is simply too bland for that.

It was spontaneous and I had no real expectations going in this movie other than knowing about (some parts of) the stellar ensemble cast.The cast is incredible with some of my favourite actors in the spotlight like Jeffrey Tambor, Paddy Considine, Jason Isaacs and of course Steve Buscemi, who as always shines in the portrayal of his character and with countenance par excellence. Tambor plays Stalin's temporary successor, who is at times more than confused about the idiotic powerplay of his fellow comrades.From the very first second the movie walks the fine line between being morally questionable and totally below the belt. Over the top performances, a lot of funny swearing, ingeniously edited intros for each character, excellent situational comedy as well as the weirdly fitting accents of the Soviet regime (ranging from Buscemi's New York accent to Considine's British accent) add to the enjoyment. Overall I can recommend ""The Death of Stalin"" to everybody who loves dark humor, though you have to be in the right mood or otherwise the partially very dark and brutal moments might be misconceived.8 out of 10 tomatoes in my pocket.",The Death of Stalin

339,cgwbrewer,"Superb film, weird press reviews (no real spoilers just a bit of history)",10,17 November 2017,"This was, for me, unquestionably the best film I have seen in 2017. It was ingenious in many respects, it was beautifully filmed, and the acting was just about perfect. As someone who has read a great deal about 20th century Russia (and much of its literature of the previous century) I was familiar with the strangeness of a country that had produced the finest artist of the past 150 years - Malevich - the greatest composer of the 20th century - Shostakovich - and some of the best poets - Akhmatova, Mandelstam - and authors - Solzhenitsyn, Pasternak, Bulgakov - and yet lived for 70 years under a near-continuous reign of terror where non- conformity would routinely end in death. It was also the source of much of the sharpest and most critical jokes anywhere. It had leaders who were almost uniformly thuggish, but - at least until after Stalin's death - had a strange respect and relationship with art: it would appear that Stalin in particular regarded poets in particular, but also writers and composers as almost shamanic figures.So it is marvellous that Armando Iannucci was able to capture the sense of dislocation and other worldliness where the paedophile torturer Beria appeared the most cultured and refined of the leaders, where one of the leaders' own spouses was in the Lubyanka but he was able to continue and function (being a senior member of the Party was probably the most risky job outside of the GULAG). Much of the review material has described the film as a ""comedy"".It isn't. It is a deadly serious epic drama in which the blackest farce intrudes on a regular basis. In Soviet Russia (as in too many of our institutions today), the notions of right and wrong were utterly absent, but attribution of virtue was determined by which side you found yourself on, and - even more importantly - it was impossible to know in advance which side to be on, or what was going to be correct tomorrow, hence the glorious scene of Khrushchev having his wife record Stalin's reactions to today's conversations. There has been much comment about the accents, but this struck me as an absolute masterstroke. Stalin was a Georgian, and I understand that the Georgian accent is both distinctive and regarded as somewhat uncivilised by (say) the Russians of Moscow. Malenkov was from the Khazakhstan border, Khruschev was born on the Ukrainian border and was of peasant stock, Beria was another Georgian, Zhukov came from a small settlement of a few thousand inhabitants. None of these were men from sophisticated societies and would almost certainly have had provincial accents, which Muscovites, and even more so, Leningraders would almost certainly have looked down on. So if the film had been recorded with Steve Buscemi ""doing"" a Ukrainian accent, Iassacs ""doing"" a 90km south-west of Moscow accent, Simon Russell Beale trying to sound as though he came from Tbilisi and so on, the audience almost certainly not had a clue that these men had diverse or non-""Received Pronunciation"" Russian accents. However, using Brooklyn for Khrushchev, Yorkshire for Zhukov and so on happily shows the diversity of background of the characters, and also show something of their social background. All this delivered with inspired economy.One other thing that does not appear to have been noted. Khrushchev and Zhukov were the two main agents on the Soviet side at Stalingrad, which was probably the climactic battle of World War 2. That the two men primarily responsible for the turning of the tide of the German invasion should have had mutual respect and an unspoken alliance was entirely to have been anticipated (even though Khrushchev sacked Zhukov years later). The film superbly lets this alliance appear almost imperceptibly - Zhukov as a force of destiny might have supported any of the contenders - and the logic of the emergence of Khrushchev becomes inevitable.",The Death of Stalin

Stalin had a small entourage, a group of cynic soviet politicians. Perhaps the strongest performance is Simon Russell Beale's Lavrenti Beria's KGB style: if he's a problem, execute him.

359,mrcrisppacket,The death of post-modern satire,3,19 November 2017,"I can't say I'm disappointed because it was exactly as expected. While I like most of Iannucci's comedy this particular subject I felt might not really work, and in an interview about the film he outlined his efforts to treat the subject of the Stalin era with the due care and attention it deserves, but in his capacity as a film director I fear he lacks the emotional maturity and imagination to give this important period proper consideration.The performances were generally good (some very), it was the overall tone of detached irony which brought the film down. In rendering a period of such horrific injustice I think it is hugely important to become immersed in the era and it's people and to find the story through an emotional connection to something/someone that jumps out during the research process. That for me is where the tragedy and comedy begins.From what I could see the jumping off point of the film (and perhaps the graphic novel though I haven't read it) came from a story about Stalin's favourite pianist, but this was changed to be less interesting than the reality and hammered into a niche to get the story going. Iancucci's emotional detachment hovers over this film like an irritating puppeteer, careening away from real stories into farce and randomised stereotyping in order to shoe-horn cross-cultural parallels into it. Having Stalin as a cockney Guy Ritchie style linchpin for example, when I suspect Stalin would have had a keen understanding of history and his place within the sociopolitical environment which would have driven him to such farcical self-aggrandisement, and in that respect could be more interesting and funnier to explore. Above all though, I just didn't get the feeling Iannucci knows how to care that much anymore. A man of the people he isn't (at least not anymore), and in this film it's nearly impossible to get purchase on any of the characters and truly follow them because the director isn't connecting with them either. There's also a whiff of blokey camaraderie about the ensemble cast which makes me think the set might have been a nauseating daily churn of egotistical one-upmanship.Without spoiling it, people die in this film, and nobody cares, not even the director. I no longer want to watch post-modern satire fumbling through world events with a sardonic detachment reserved for those unaffected by those events. In this era of absolute farce governed by mass hysteria what I want is an almost zealous commitment to a story and it's people. The world we currently live in has been labelled post-truth, but I regard it as more of a post-trust world. In this respect I'd like to see artists that defy this cynicism and immerse themselves in the real and the tangible (and us with them).Dig deep, that's all I ask for. Please.",The Death of Stalin
