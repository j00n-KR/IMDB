0,TheLittleSongbird,Style over substance,4,9 June 2021,"The book by Daphne Du Maurier is amazing and a favourite, a masterpiece of suspenseful atmosphere and psychological depth. There are three versions of 'Rebecca' prior to this latest one from 2020, the best known one justifiably being the Alfred Hitchcock directed film. While the 70s adaptation with Jeremy Brett is the best version as an adaptation, Hitchcock's is my personal favourite. Even with inevitable changes to suit the code, it is superbly made, acted (Judith Anderson is unforgettable) and directed, true in spirit to the book's atmosphere.Unfortunately, this version is inferior in nearly all those aspects. It does have its good things, but of all the four versions of 'Rebecca' it is easily the worst for me. Being the only one to not work, the other three are excellent and more. Visually and stylistically, this 'Rebecca' is mostly very successful. When it comes to the substance however, this film adaptation and standalone wise is a failure. Actually don't think one needs to have seen any of the previous versions or read the book to see how badly flawed the film is, a friend of mine also saw it with no prior knowledge of the source material or previous adaptations and disliked it too, highlighting the lack of atmosphere, shallow characterisation, erratic pacing, messy final act and Armie Hammer as particular flaws.'Rebecca' (2020) has good things. It does look gorgeous, though in my mind the film would have benefitted from a darker look either in a Gothic or noir-ish sense. The film is exquisitely photographed and the settings have beauty and vivid atmosphere, especially in Monte Carlo. Apart from the yellow suit, the costumes are nice and Manderlay is a beautiful and atmospheric house if not quite the character of its own kind that the previous three adaptations achieved. Clint Mansell's score has parts where it is ominous and stirs the emotions.Didn't care for the performances on the whole, but Kristin Scott Thomas is very good indeed as Mrs Danvers and there is a formidable quality that makes her very memorable. Sam Reilly's Favell is deceptively friendly but suitably manipulative, though could have afforded to have been more caddish.However, Lily James and Hammer didn't do it for me in their roles. Actually like James as an actress, ever since her charming 'Cinderella', but she lacks the plain mousiness that is needed for the 2nd Mrs De Winter and comes over as too neurotic in her more haunted moments. Hammer is also too young (especially considering that there is meant to be a big age difference, without it the story dynamic doesn't work) and too handsome, personality wise he is like a bland uncharismatic cipher as well as jerk-ish even when Maxim's character writing darkens. The lack of chemistry between the two really hurts the film and too lukewarm romantic comedy-like instead of the conflicted one it ought to be. The characters are stripped of their complexity and become one-dimensional, the most interesting is Mrs Danvers easily but that is down to Thomas mainly.Furthermore, the script could have flowed more and is too mundane with no spark. Some of it was awkward too. The direction is too constrained and tends to be pedestrian in the first half and then out of control and too reliant on a horror vibe in the second. The story is completely lacking in suspense and the omnipresent spookiness just isn't there, with the psychology of the characters being too muted. Likewise with the more mysterious elements in the story. The pacing is a mess too, it takes too long to get going and is too deliberate in the first half and then the final act especially becomes very rushed and jumpy. This part of the film is also far too melodramatic, the tone shift is not just completely uneasy and jarring but the second half feels like a different film altogether and in a schlocky horror way, not in a suspensefully psychological way. The ending is very tacked on and did reek of studio interference or of the writers not being sure how to end the film.In summary, liked the style but the substance underwhelms. Very disappointing. 4/10.",Rebecca
1,Leofwine_draca,Why bother...,4,1 February 2021,"It beats me why directors and studios keep insisting on remaking, reimagining and reworking the old classics that don't need touching in the first place. REBECCA (2020) is a case in point: Hitchcock already did the definitive version of the Daphne du Maurier story back in 1940 despite changing the book slightly, and this new Netflix adaptation doesn't even come close. It's REBECCA for the DOWNTON ABBEY crowd, and lead actress Lily James - a DOWNTOWN alumnus herself - puts in a woefully bland turn as the lead, a far cry from Joan Fontaine's performance finesse in the Hitchcock film.Directorial duties are handed to British director Ben Wheatley, still generating a lot of goodwill a decade after KILL LIST; personally I find him hugely overrated, but I know he has a lot of fans. At its heart, the novel is a rich gothic mystery and a unique spin on the ghost or haunted house genre; more psychological and realistic than supernatural, but just as affecting. Here, there's little mystery and no atmosphere at all; you don't feel a thing. The sets and costumes look good, as they always do in modern historicals, but the writing is uneven at best. The only thing that made an impression on me was Armie Hammer's lead and that was for all the wrong reasons; check this guy's Twitter account if you want to find out more about him, but let's just say he's hardly a romantic hero.",Rebecca
2,SnoopyStyle,fine,6,27 October 2020,"The protagonist (Lily James) is a companion-assistant to rich abusive Mrs. Van Hopper (Ann Dowd) traveling in Monte Carlo. They encounter wealthy man-about-town Maxim de Winter (Armie Hammer). He falls for the poor orphan young girl and they get married. He is still haunted by his first wife Rebecca who died in a boating accident. They return to his large estate Manderley with a vast cast of servants led by the harsh Mrs. Danvers (Kristin Scott Thomas).It's interesting that the lead character remains nameless. I've never read the Daphne du Maurier novel. I always assumed that her novels are pulpy romances. It probably meant that the book was written in a first person point of view putting the reading in the young assistant's shoes. It's a great way to get the female readers to embody the protagonist and walk her journey. I wonder if the movie should try doing something as experimental as strictly using the first person point of view. It does need something. As it stands, it's a rather old style melodramatic narrative. There are some attempt at gothic horror. The film looks beautiful. The actors are fine. In the end, nothing is superior or new or punch you in the face. It's fine.",Rebecca
3,Hitchcoc,Why Bother,4,30 October 2020,"Slick and pretty, but lacking any real spark. I know the Hitchcock movie so well, I couldn't help comparing at every turn. The former had so much atmosphere. There was something plodding about this one. What lies beneath in the first is all on the surface here. As the second wife changes, there is an abruptness that causes too much change in too short a time. The ""gaslighting"" that we suspect is at work in Hitchcock's version, isn't really there. I never asked myself, ""Just what is Max up to?"" Worth a look, but didn't need to be made.",Rebecca
4,Prismark10,Rebecca,6,27 October 2020,"Dame Kristin Scott Thomas follows in the footsteps of Dame Judith Anderson and Dame Diana Rigg as Mrs Danvers.Unfortunately Armie Hammer has to follow Laurence Olivier, Jeremy Brett and Charles Dance. Well let's say that unlike Dance who was too old for the role. Hammer is about the age that Oliver was when he played Maxim de Winter.The story is about a lowly young woman (Lily James) who has a whirlwind romance in the south of France with wealthy widower widower Maxim de Winter.When the newly married Mrs de Winter arrives to his ancestral home Manderley. She finds that her naivety is exposed by Mrs Danvers, the sinister housekeeper who was hopelessly devoted to Rebecca, the first Mrs de Winter who died in a tragic boating accident about a year before.It is a beginning of mind games between the two characters while Maxim seems to be haunted himself by Rebecca.Director Ben Wheatley has form with low budget English folk horror films. He also directed Peter Capaldi's feature length debut story of Doctor Who.With the help of a Netflix budget. Wheatley focuses more on the courtship in the South of France. There is a folk song played as the couple travel to Manderley which I thought will lead to an eerie Gothic atmosphere.There is a more lesbian subtext regarding Mrs Danvers and her infatuation with Rebecca.Somehow this is rather old fashioned. It is better than the 1997 ITV mini series but I expected more of Wheatley's own stamp.",Rebecca
5,kosmasp,Call her by her name,7,10 July 2021,"This is a movie based on a novel - it is also or I would consider it a remake of Hitchcocks version of the source novel. Now I say that without having read the novel - but having seen the movie that had its 80th Birthday when this was released. Maybe this was meant to honor that Birthday.Whatever the case, if you only watch one of the two movies, I'd tell you to watch the Hitchcock version. While this does a bit of an update (and kind of changes a couple of things ... sort of), the original is better.Having said that, this had a great source and did not destroy that. By having a really good director and a good cast at hand, it manages to do a good movie. And when I say it changes things ... most are shuffled around dialog and scenes. It does seem to keep the spirit and the theme of the original.The tweaks are meant to make certain things better ... which you can question - or you may like the changes. The ending is different - and there is a mirroring on the fate of someone close to Rebecca ... which might make more sense than what the original did with the character ... again, this will depend on your own sentiment. Not many will watch the ""same"" movie twice anyway.A neat update, but Hitchcock did it better.",Rebecca
6,Sleepin_Dragon,"Pretty good, perhaps missing a little something.",6,23 October 2020,"I had such high hopes for this, anticipation was high, especially as new material has been somewhat thin on the ground this year, for obvious reasons.I did raise an eyebrow when I heard that Armie Hammer had been cast as Maxim, but I felt he did a decent job, it gives me hope for his upcoming part in Death on the Nile.The standout for me was Kristin Scott Thomas, she was a fearsome Mrs Danvers, very impressive.The film itself, very stylish, and had some good moments. If I'm totally honest, I was a tad disappointed, I think the pacing was a bit off, it perhaps felt a bit rushed at the ending.A few reviewers calling for no remakes, and yes the 1940 adaptation is the ultimate, but come on, many of us love seeing a retelling. However, if you haven't seen the adaptation with Olivier and Fontaine, I urge you to, it captures the atmosphere beautifully.Overall, it's a good watch, maybe it's the sinister atmosphere that's perhaps lacking. 6/10.",Rebecca
7,jboothmillard,Rebecca,5,21 April 2021,"Most people would recall the original black-and-white Alfred Hitchcock classic, based on the book by Daphne Du Maurier, well this new adaptation brings the action into colour, directed Ben Wheatley (Kill List, Sightseers, Free Fire). Basically, whilst in Monte Carlo, working for Mrs. Van Hopper (The Handmaid's Tale's Ann Dowd), an inexperienced young woman (Lily James) meets aristocratic widower George Fortescue Maximilian ""Maxim"" de Winter (Armie Hammer). The two spend a good deal of time together, leading to love and marriage. Maxim takes his new bride back to Manderley, his grand mansion by the sea in south-western England. She meets the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Kristin Scott Thomas), a domineering and cold woman obsessed with the memory of the first Mrs. De Winter, the eponymous Rebecca. Mrs. Danvers has preserved Rebecca's former grand bedroom and continues to display various items that carry her monogram (the letter ""R""). The spiritual presence of Rebecca causes Mrs. De Winter to believe that Maxim is still in love with his first wife. Jack Favell (Sam Riley), Rebecca's cousin comes to visit, which angers Maxim. It is only later, talking to Maxim's sister Beatrice Lacy (Keeley Hawes), that Mrs. De Winter discovers what happened to Rebecca; she died out at sea after her vessel capsized, and her body was washed ashore sometime later. Wanting to please her husband, Mrs. De Winter suggests holding a costume ball as he and Rebecca used to. Mrs. De Winter's personal maid Clarice (Bryony Miller) suggests a dress worn by a young woman in one of the portraits displayed on the staircase, implied to be one of Maxim's ancestors. But, when Mrs. De Winter comes down the staircase wearing the costume, the guests are shocked, and Maxim is furious as Rebecca wore an identical dress at her last ball. Realiaing that Mrs. Danvers had manipulated Clarice, and believing that Maxim now regrets their marriage, Mrs. De Winter has a small breakdown. Mrs. Danvers reveals her contempt for the new Mrs. De Winter, believing she is trying to replace Rebecca. She tries to convince a helpless and disturbed Mrs. De Winter to jump to her death from the window. At that moment, however, the alarm is raised because a boat has been discovered, brought ashore by a storm. The boat is Rebecca's, and her body has been identified aboard. The investigation of Rebecca's death is reopened, and Maxim is suspected of murder. Maxim confesses to his new wife that he misidentified another body as Rebecca's in order to conceal the truth. He hated Rebecca, who was cruel, selfish, adulterous, and manipulative and the marriage had been a sham from the start. She pretended to be the perfect wife and hostess for the sake of appearances. On the night of her death, Rebecca told Maxim that she was pregnant with another man's child. She placed his gun to her chest and stated that the only way to be free of her was to kill her. Enraged, Maxim pulled the trigger, then disposed of her body, placing it in her boat and sinking it. Despite his confession, Mrs. De Winter is relieved to know that Maxim loves her and resolves to support him during the investigation. Favell attempts to blackmail Maxim, claiming to have a written note from Rebecca as proof that she did not commit suicide. The trial shows Rebecca's boat to have been deliberately sunk. In the court, Mrs. Danvers implies that a visit by Rebecca to a doctor was linked to her pregnancy, and Maxim's check written to Favell for the note is shown. Maxim is placed under arrest for murder. Mrs. De Winter fires Danvers and locates Rebecca's doctor, Dr. Baker (Bill Paterson). Reading her file reveals that Rebecca could not have been pregnant because she had advanced and incurable cancer and she would have died within a few months. An investigator concludes Rebecca committed suicide by scuttling her boat, while Mrs. De Winter privately concludes that Rebecca wanted Maxim to kill her. Absolved, Maxim and Mrs. De Winter drive home. Returning to Madeley, they are shocked to see the mansion on fire. A maid reveals that Mrs. Danvers started the fire and fled. Mrs. De Winter races to the cliffs and finds Mrs. Danvers standing at the edge. She pleads with Mrs. Danvers not to jump, but Mrs. Danvers curses her and Maxim to never know happiness and jumps into the sea and drowns. Years later, Mrs. De Winter is with Maxim, as they search for their dream home. Also starring Tom Goodman-Hill as Frank Crawley, Ben Crompton as Ben, Jane Lapotaire as Granny, and Mark Lewis Jones as Inspector Welch. James is good as the quivering wife, Hammer is a little blank as the husband, but at least Scott Thomas is as always reliable as the sinister housemaid. Like the original, it is a film of two halves, the first about the new wife trying and failing to fit in, and the second the truth about the first wife's death being exposed, it really makes the most of the use of colour, from the emaculate costumes and lavish locations, and it has terrific camerawork and a splendid score by Clint Mansell. It does not have quite have the same eerie atmosphere and psychological element as the original, but it an interesting enough romantic thriller. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Production Design. Worth watching!",Rebecca
8,CinemaSerf,Not a hint of Hitch...,5,21 October 2020,"I reckon we ought to set up a panel of worthy people to whom producers must apply when they want to make a remake of a classic - ""King Kong"" or ""Psycho"" or... ""Rebecca"". If they cannot convince them that there is any point in a ""reimagining"", then they don't get to make it...! That way, we might be spared sterile, charm free efforts like this from Ben Wheatley. True, the camera loves both Lily James and Armie Hammer, and Dame Kristin Scott Thomas is always a formidable screen presence; but this just lacks any sense of suspense or menace. The costumes and scenery are all beautiful, but these depictions of Dame Daphne du Maurier's torn and tortured characters are as flat as a flounder with the dialogue frequently over-forced to the point that I wanted to cringe. The effects are really pretty poor - especially at the end, too, and all in all it has straight to tv written all over it!",Rebecca
9,Calicodreamin,Lifeless,5,24 October 2020,"This was poorly portrayed as a thriller/mystery, when in fact it wasn't much more than a lifeless drama. It wasn't enough of anything to even categorize. Cinematography was beautiful, but acting was only okay. Characters had no depth and the storyline was only moderately interesting.",Rebecca
10,phd_travel,Interesting update but some flaws,6,23 October 2020,"Each version of Rebecca has it's pros and cons. The Hitchcock version with Lawrence Olivier and Joan Fontaine is just too dated by today's standards. I used to think the 1979 version with Jeremy Brett and Anna Massey was fine. The acting was good and the story effectively told. But nobody was very attractive in that version so it was interesting to see an updated 2020 version with such A list actors as the lead characters. Lily James is such an animated actress she makes anything seem involving. That's why the first part of the show is watchable and her romance is nice to watch. There is more passion than they could have shown in the earlier versions. The tinted view of the South of France is beguiling. But during the court case and the ending there is a lack of intensity and the story feels dated and rushed. The reveal from Maxim about Rebecca's death is weak and unclear. Armie Hammer looks right for these classic older stories. Maybe it's the 30s costume but he looks more than usual like a giant. He isn't quite tortured enough and maybe because he doesn't have a British accent or even put one on he seems less effective during the intense moments.
The settings are nice from the South of France to the coast line in England to the interiors of the country house. The house didn't feel creepy like in the 79 version. But the director used too much dark lighting maybe unaware at that time that everything would be on TV these days instead of the cinema. Kristin Scott Thomas isn't menacing enough as Mrs Danvers - maybe because she is still beautiful even though she is older.
Despite the flaws fans of the story will want to check out this 2020 version.",Rebecca
11,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Unsuccessful modern take on renowned tale,4,7 December 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningA young woman (Lily James) becomes a 'social assistant' to a snobby older posh lady, only to catch the eye of Maxim de Winter (Arnie Hammer), a renowned figure on the social scene. Before long, she has become Mrs. de Winter, and moved in to Manderlay, Maxim's stately home, although her new husband is strangely guarded on certain things. All of a sudden, strange occurances begin taking place, which seem to be initiated by Mrs. Danvers (Kristen Scott Thomas), the resident housekeeper, all threatening to reveal a secret too terrifying for words.For such an avid film watcher, I must confess to being far less cultured than I would like to admit, and so with a touch of embarrassment, I must say this is the first incarnation of Daphne Du Maurier's well regarded novel Rebecca that I have seen. My first experience of hearing 'last night, I dreamt again of Manderlay', and 'the second Mrs. de Winter' and of Mrs. Danvers, alas with a modern spin by director Ben Wheatley, adding his distinctive touch. But sadly, even he can't bring this old tale into present times.There's always some potential in bringing an enduring tale in to present times, but the old Hollywood style and period dialogue just comes off as alienating to a present day film viewer, not acquainted with the story or the timeframe it exists in. As a result, it just lingers on for the most part, failing to really engage or draw you into the story, only really coming to life in the final half. It captures the fashions and style of the time quite well, and does generate some intrigue, but not really enough to last all the way.It might have helped if I had as much affection for the tale as Wheatley obviously has, and maybe if I saw some different versions of it, I might think of it differently, but this modern update of it simply leaves me cold. **",Rebecca
12,paul2001sw-1,Nicely paced and delivered,8,25 October 2020,"'Rebecca' is a romantic thriller, set in the 1930s (when Daphne Du Maurier wrote the novel on which it is based) and with at leasr three distinct plot twists; it was famously filmed by Hitchcock. It's characters move in a monied world and Ben Wheatley's new version certainly looks luscious; it's also put together very nicely: the timing is well-judged, and the level of creepy atmospherics is judged just right). There's also a interesting ""feminism gone wrong"" vibe behind the devotion her former servant shows for the absent title character. The film's biggest failing is the presentation of final twist, which is slightly botched (the book's Wikipedia page will make clear what the film does not convey).",Rebecca
13,MOscarbradley,So much better than I expected.,8,22 October 2020,"Whatever you do, don't approach Ben Wheatley's new film ""Rebecca"" as a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's much beloved classic, not that it ever would have been; Wheatley is his own man and we always knew he would do things differently, in this case sticking more closely to the book and casting it in such a way as to banish all memories of Fontaine, Olivier and Dame Judith and in this he has been largely successful. Armie Hammer is a lot less melancholy, if a tad modern, than Lord Larry ever was. Lily James is much more down-to-earth and obviously a good deal more sensual than Joan while Kristin Scott Thomas gives Mrs. Danvers a human side that was totally lacking in Judith Anderson's performance. Indeed, regardless of what else you think of the film I doubt if anyone could find fault with Scott Thomas who effortlessly walks away with the picture.It also benefits from a Manderley that really looks like it might be one of the finest houses in all of England and the whole thing is beautifully shot by Laurie Rose in widescreen and colour. Fans of Mr. Hitchcock's version are unlikely to be won over; however, newcomers and fans of Du Maurier's novel should find plenty here to please them though the device of not giving the new Mrs. De Winter a Christian name seems even more contrived this time round.",Rebecca
14,Cineanalyst,Haunted by Hitchcock,4,29 October 2020,"I see some critics musing over ""Rebecca,"" ostensibly an adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's novel, but cinematically marked as a remake and overshadowed by Alfred Hitchcock's Best Picture Oscar winner of 1940, why it was made, which is to suggest that it shouldn't have been made at all. Maybe not by those who made it, but I think conceptually the idea of remaking this particular adaptation was potentially clever. More so than ""Psycho"" (1960 and 1998), at least. The Gothic narrative is all about a house haunted by its deceased former occupant and a marriage overshadowed by a former one--read: Hitchcock is the Rebecca to this 2020 Netflix movie. Perhaps, not unlike how ""Jane Eyre"" was the Rebecca to the book ""Rebecca"" itself.This ""Rebecca,"" though, feels more as though it were haunted by ""Downton Abbey."" It surely has the air of superficial Anglophilia for class structures--the turgid cross-class romantic fairy tale, the upstairs-downstairs, masters-and-servants melodrama--about it. We get plenty of period detail, lovely costumes and some glorious architecture, and it's often pictorially pleasant, but it doesn't appear to be leveraged at the helm in any interesting manner. It merely comes across as pretty and bland as the acting of Lily James and Armie Hammer. Kristin Scott Thomas is better. But, it's like her character's thaumatrope instead of the 1940 picture's film-within-a-film scene; the elements are drawn out, but there's nothing to animate the material. We get static characterizations and slight, unnecessary or otherwise counterproductive story alterations; the epilogue is particularly bad and not the one from the book and which was wisely dropped in the 1940 film. This where there was once a landmark in cinematographic exploration of architecture and space that haunted, including influencing ""Citizen Kane"" (1941). This 2020 version doesn't haunt; it'll be forgotten.",Rebecca
15,cruise01,Decent drama thriller that could have been so much more but is left feeling empty.,6,2 November 2020,"3 out of 5 stars.Rebecca is a fair drama thriller film that is beautiful to look at with the set locations, cinematography, and Ben Wheatly trying to deliver a mystery thriller direction. But it does feel short handed with surprises and twists. Which the film is short on surprises. Which many may not be surprised.The plot follows Lily James character as she runs into Maxim (Armie Hammer) who owns an estate. They both fall for each other. When Lily is being driven away. Maxim proposes to her. Which they get married and she moves into the estate. She soon finds out he is a widow after his former wife was lost at sea. And apparently drowned. When Mrs. Danvers (Kristen Scott Thomas) is rude and unwelcoming to her. She discovers that there is so much more that she does not know.It was a decent plot. Starting out as Lily James is a girl that wants to travel. And takes the companionship as a job to get her to travel. Until she runs into Armie Hammers character which the films direction becomes like a romantic drama film. Except Hammers character has an attitude every time she brings up about his former wife who passed away. Or avoids talking about his past. The plot does change gears in the final half hour when the twist is revealed. And it becomes something more of a serious drama. Which is also where it disappoints with a twist that feels a little short handed.Lily James is lovable as Mrs. de Winters. She is sweet and curious. It is difficult to not like her character. James delivers a great performance. Armie Hammer is good as Maxim. Playing a mysterious character which he is struggling with his past. Kristen Scott Thomas is okay playing Mrs. Danvers. Who looks disgusted every time she sees Mrs. de Winters.Ben Wheatly does deliver a beautiful cinematography and tone with the set locations. And trying to build an eerie bleak mystery. But it lacks momentum or thrills.",Rebecca
16,eddie_baggins,A dull new take on the Rebecca tale,4,25 October 2020,"Since announcing himself with the horror treat that was Kill List all the way back in 2011, English director Ben Wheatley has struggled to recapture the goodness that was found in his breakout cult hit with films that offer tantalizing glimpses into the director that could be but never form into the cohesive whole that would undeniably encase the talented artist into the top line of modern day auteurs.Based on both the classic Daphne Du Maurier novel and the renowned Alfred Hitchcock film of the same name, Wheatley's reimagining of gothic thriller Rebecca seemed like an intriguing choice for the director who has previously steered very clear from more mainstream content and while its great to see Wheatley hold back from his usual gratuitous violence and dark humor, this pretty looking Netflix period piece may look the part but its a cold and drab affair in most instances, making one wonder why exactly Wheatley and his creative team felt the need to give Rebecca a fresh coat of paint at all.Teaming up beautiful stars Armie Hammer and Lily James to play the titular Mr and Mrs de Winter, things start off well enough as the two begin a courtship that leads to a quickfire marriage and a rushing back to Hammer's Maxim's lavish manner in England that is run by Kristin Scott Thomas's scheming Mrs. Danvers in the wake of Maxim's trauma due to the loss of his previous wife Rebecca, but Wheatley's film never finds a comfortable groove as it fails to capture its romance angle or its mystery/thriller angles and instead gets lost in a lot of eye pleasing and solid production values but not a whole lot of anything else.For such a horror obsessed director, its curious that Wheatley wasn't able to instill his own brand of devilishly inventive scares or chills into Du Maurier's oft-imitated tale as Rebecca for the most part remains thrill free throughout with the scariest thing throughout some odd sleepwalking and some creepy stares.Without these chills and thrills Hammer and James have a lot of work to do as the seemingly mismatched couple and the two charismatic performers aren't able to elevate proceedings a whole lot with the initial wins they have as head over heels lovers quickly giving way to a hum-drum series of procedurals that wont surprise or entertain anyone that's ever seen or read a tale of this ilk before and at days end, we come to an overarching sense that we just don't care enough about these two characters as Rebecca draws slowly towards its end game.Final Say -A pretty to look at but otherwise lifeless redo of the Rebecca tale, Ben Wheatley once more fails to capture the magic of his early career work in what is another disappointment in his growing collection of mid to low-tier of films.2 Oyster breakfasts out of 5",Rebecca
17,marmar-69780,Rebecca,5,21 October 2020,Rebecca is a new version of a famous novel and perhaps even more famous Hitchcock film which is simply said far above this version but still this wasnt completly awful watch and it had some solid staff in it.Lily and Armie were good together and they had solid chemistry but simply said their acting abbilities are not even close to a level of Joan Fontaine and Laurance Olivier but they still give they best job concering their material.Story was somewhat fine but it had many referances to a book and 40 version in which some scenes looked to similiar.Rebecca was in end not surprisingly not better then older version but it had a cute stars,Rebecca

19,alindsay-al,A Poor Unnecessary Remake,3,26 October 2020,"So this film is a remake of the famous film directed by the legendary Alfred Hitchcock of the same name and has now made its way to Netflix and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young newlywed arrive at her husbands family estate where the legacy of his former wife Rebecca remains.Main Character
Lily James has been in the news lately for some pretty bad things but let's just talk about her performance in this film and unfortunately I didn't care about her character at all. She is just so dull and she never seems like a human being, she is either overacting every scene or just moping about. Also her character is so inconsistent, it is tough to explain without spoilers but she makes some decisions that just feel very strange and like they don't fit with what we have seen throughout the ret of the film.Supporting Characters
Kristen Scott Thomas plays the head maid in the house and I thought she did a good job, she is very chilling and stern in the film, she comes across as a dastardly person and she just does a good job at it here. Sam Riley who I like as an actor has a small role here and I thought he did a good job, it's just a shame that he doesn't have more screen time and more to do here. Armie Hammer plays the husband in this film and he didn't do much for me, he also was a dull character, that I never cared about him or their relationship. They just lacked chemistry and the problem is that neither of them gave me a reason to care about them and this relationship that we are meant to be rooting for.Story
The story in the film has some interesting things in it, especially towards the end of the film as more is revealed about what exactly is going as reveals get made and things get more crazy. But none of it really matters, it is very jumbled and not expanded upon, it is like the film meanders so much for the first half of the film that it has to rush the last act and it is clear to see with a truly awful ending.Script
The script isn't very good, there is no memorable bits of dialogue and nothing that fleshes out these characters. As I said earlier the writing is so poor and rushes lots of its plot to the 3rd act which makes you confused.Style
The best part of this film is that it is really nice to look at, it has great costumes, great locations and great visuals and that is about it. This is a really slow film that feels 3 hours when it is only 2, with not much going on it just feels like a real slog to get through.Overall
Overall, this is a really poor film and shows why sometimes remakes and reboots are just unnecessary unless it is going to be done to a high quality. Save yourself 2 hours and skip this one.",Rebecca

Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, Manderley been burned by Mrs. Danvers at the end! At the end, Maxim release from the jail after proving Rebecca kill herself by Mrs. de Winter! Maxim and Mrs. de Winter move to Cairo at the very end! That's it! Another disappointed film!",Rebecca
21,henry8-3,Rebecca,5,7 November 2020,"Mega rich Maxim De Winter (Hammer) falls and marries young and shy Lily James and they move to his vast estate, Manderley where the spirit of his previous wife, Rebecca looms large, thanks in no small part to the efforts of Rebecca's loyal servant Mrs Danvers (Scott Thomas).Comparisons with Hitchcock's Oscar winner are inevitable and on the whole this sticks to that format, albeit it also follows more closely to Du Maurier's book particularly in the last third. The issue here is the 2 principal leads - Hammer gets overly aggressive and mysterious which lacks the subtlety of Olivier's performance and James is just far too wimpy. Scott Thomas though puts in a far less Gothic, but no less obsessive turn than Judith Anderson's original.Well worth a watch then for a good first and final act, shame about the middle, particularly the psychedelic ball, which is a mess.",Rebecca
22,yusufpiskin,"Grimly atmospheric and dutifully Gothic, but...",7,21 October 2020,"While his films might be an acquired taste, it cannot be denied that Ben Wheatley is one of the most unconventional voices in contemporary cinema. Personally, I love Ben Wheatley and have enjoyed all of his films to varying degrees (with High-Rise, Wheatley's most polarizing feature in a filmography full of them, being my favorite of his), one reason being that I find his unorthodox approach to filmmaking, in an era where it almost feels like idiosyncrasy in filmmaking is sadly dying, to be highly refreshing. However, given that multiple adaptations of Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca already exist, with the most famous one being the Best Picture winner directed by Alfred Hitchcock, I couldn't help but be highly curious as to what Wheatley would do with this project, and was even cautious after discovering that this is the first of Ben Wheatley's features to not be written by him or his writing partner Amy Jump. It certainly didn't help that the the trailer left much to be desired.That said, maybe I shouldn't have been worried, because even despite operating on a more accessible level, this new adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's acclaimed novel not only proves to be another stellar effort from an idiosyncratic filmmaker with an already commendable body of work, but is one that even improves on Hitchcock's film in various aspects.",Rebecca
23,Pairic,A Gothic Thriller,8,24 October 2020,"Rebecca: This is not a horror film but with Ben Wheatley at the helm as Director you can be sure of a dark adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's classic novel. Lily James is the new Mrs de Winter and from her first arrival at Manderley ,the housekeeper Mrs Danvers (Kristin Scott Thomas), makes her feel as if she is usurping the late Rebecca de Winter. Gaslighting of James continues, especially at the Ball she organises. Rebecca may be dead but her presence rules over the house. The film opens in Monte Carlo where James is a companion to a wealthy American, Mrs Van Hopper. The feel and cinematography at this stage is reminiscent of The Talented Mr Ripley. While James is no imposter she does suffer from imposter syndrome. When Maxim de Winter (Arnie Hammer) sweeps her off her feet and proposes marriage, Mrs Van Hopper tells her she is just a passing interest for him. This makes Danvers work all the easier. Wheatley has delivered a Gothic movie which touches on horror at times but the pacing is off. Too much is crammed into the second half of Rebecca with the all important revelations coming at us too quickly. It may not achieve classic status but it is both intriguing and entertaining. On Netflix. 8/10.",Rebecca
24,masonfisk,WHY REMAKE A CLASSIC...HERE'S WHY...!,6,21 January 2021,"The recent Netflix remake of the 1940 Best Picture winner (directed by some clown named Alfred Hitchcock). Now starring Lily James & Armie Hammer (in the roles established by Joan Fontaine & Laurence Olivier) we find James working as a valet for a rich dowager (played by Ann Dowd looking unrecognizable), an American on vacation in Europe who's staying at a swank hotel. Unrehearsed in the ways of the world, James (working for a paltry 90 pounds a year) is pushed around & shoved to do her job waiting hand & foot on Dowd's behalf generally not enjoying the sumptuous surroundings about her but things change when the mysterious & rich, Maxim DeWinter, Hammer, shows up at the resort setting tongues a-wagging. Dowd, hoping to get into his good graces & probably dish some gossip, hopes to be seated w/Hammer when he goes to dine sending James as her emissary but in meet cute fashion Hammer does end up finding her to be the bee's knees & they start to date (Dowd falls sick & thankfully for James bedridden) which when their time at the hotel comes to an end the picture postcard sheen of their romance bears fruit when they marry. They then head to back to Hammer's estate, Manderlay, where the staff meets the new Mrs. DeWinter & the house matron, Mrs. Danvers, played by Kristin Scott Thomas, still exalts the name & memory of the former mistress (the Rebecca of the title who passed away when she drowned) keeping James on edge throughout her stay which forces her, whether she likes it or not, to assume the mantle she's married into & have some say over the household. Now the big elephant in the room can be addressed, was the original Rebecca so antiquated & past its prime it needed a remake? No way full stop. Does this film hurt the memory of the original? No, again. While hitting a lot of the same story beats as its predecessor, it also adds unnecessary subplots (maybe from Daphne Du Maurier's novel?) which end up adding nothing w/the awesome & iconic finale of Manderlay & Mrs. Danvers going up in flames changed to something a bit muted & less bombastic. The actors are fine but in no way do they outdo their betters but for those out there who deign to even glimpse a film prior to a certain date in their heads, this version may be the one they'll adore, for me I liked it, that's it.",Rebecca
25,dierregi,Yet another useless remake,2,26 October 2020,"I've always disliked narrative involving ""nameless characters"" but in this case I could make an exception, because the main female character is a shy, mousy type, so insignificant as not being worthy of a name.Lily James is totally miscast because she's not mousy enough; besides, her look is too modern: bushy eyebrows were not fashionable in the 30s and her haircut is also wrong.Not only she doesn't look the part but her acting is subpar. First she plays a fake ingenue, eager to have sex with a man she met a couple of days earlier, then in Manderley she goes through confusion, bewilderment and fear, all of which read on her face as if she is constipated.Hammer is wooden and not mysterious. First he seems to fall in lust almost immediately, then he ""gets busy"" the way men do and finally confesses to a crime like he's reading a shopping list.Scott Thomas is the best of the three, but it's not great compliment, considering how bad James and Hammer are. She is campy and not subtle at all.A further note of demerit goes to the ball scene, grotesque beyond belief and what's left is one point to the beautiful settings and one for the costumes - otherwise this remake is totally missable.",Rebecca
26,valleyjohn,Wheatley blows cold again.,6,9 November 2020,"I went into watching Rebecca having never read the book or seen the Alfred Hitchcock movie , so I had no idea what the story was about and at the end I was left wondering what all the fuss was about ?A young newlywed arrives at her husband's imposing family estate on a windswept English coast and finds herself battling the shadow of his first wife, Rebecca, whose legacy lives on in the house long after her death.This has the feel of a really old story . Set at a time when the plot would have been quite controversial but sadly , in today's world , it feels really tame. I'm not convinced a Daphne Du Maurier novel has the pizazz required and I would have liked to have seen a modern day version.It looks fantastic as most Netflix films do . The house is quite spectacular.
The performances are perfectly fine . Probably the stand actor is Kristen Scott Thomas who does menacing brilliantly.
There is also a very odd soundtrack. It's littered with folk music , which is nice on its own but feels really out of place for a period drama .
But the real problem I have is the story is dull . It's a little bit like a who done it, but without the intrigue and I kept thinking - There is going to be a great twist here - but the pay off never happened sadly.",Rebecca

29,jadepietro,The Phantom of the Soap Opera,4,25 October 2020,"GRADE: C-THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: The specter of Hitchcock haunts this soapy and dopey remake of his classic movie.JIM'S REVIEW: All marriages have their secrets and the recent nuptials of Maxim de Winter and our sweet naive heroine certainly do have their share in this unnecessary remake of Alfred Hitchcock's Oscar-winning classic, Rebecca. Gone is the Gothic mystery elements and romantic intrigue. Substituted now are period costumes and panoramic vistas one could find in a cheap Hallmark movie. No star leads now, just second-tier replicas in place of Sir Lawrence Olivier and Joan Fontaine. The only real mystery is why update this film in the first place.The movie starts off slowly with a whirlwind courtship along the coast of Monte Carlo with our two leads, Lily James and Armie Hammer. They do make a dashing couple. She, dressed in her Annie Hall best, complete with tennis racket, and he in his Gatsby-tailored finery. Their romance is silly and sun-baked, rarely believable. It takes nearly a half hour before they wed and head for Manderley, the stately estate once owned by the handsome Maxim and his former dead wife, Rebecca.The movie always looks stylish and picturesque, but never has any suspense or genuine menace. It's all Hollywood dress-up time. The direction by Ben Wheatley is adequate but not very accomplished. Mr. Wheatley seems more concerned with the expensive trappings than the main characters trapped in the film's conventional storytelling. Heavy-handed use of dream sequences are interspersed to bring tension throughout the film, but they only make the movie more ludicrous. The screenplay by Jane Goldman, Joe Shrapnel, and Anna Waterhouse covers the Daphne Du Maurier novel's dense plotting but without any finesse. The film seems perfectly content to focus on the soap opera contrivance and moves the mystery aside. Sorely missing is that Hitchcock touch and his concise adaptation of the Du Maurier best-selling novel, although this version does stay true to the novel's ending. But is that enough to justify this disappointing remake? (You already know my answer.)Mr. Hammer's interpretation of his role as Mr. de Winter is odd, more petulant child than the moody grieving widow. Ms. James lacks the vulnerability and innocence as the second Mrs. de Winter and she tends to over-emote in some crucial scenes. Both actors have done better work. Only Kristin Scott Thomas comes off unscathed. She never approaches the greatness of Judith Anderson's monstrous housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, in the Hitchcock original, but she comes very close. Her highly controlled mannerisms and intense line delivery is splendid. Her early monologue revering her former employer is the film's emotional highlight.As the new bride become unhinged and manipulated by her dubious housekeeper, the melodramatic excesses go full throttle, all leading to a nightmarish gala that goes predictably off kilter. When the plot twists finally arrive and are revealed, one doesn't care a sixpence about this cockamamy soap opera love story or its doomed lovers. The plot may thicken, but this rich consommé is cinematic peasant stew compared to the superior 1940 Gothic thriller. In retrospect, this Rebecca never stood a ghost of a chance.",Rebecca
30,nancyldraper,This movie never found it's pace,5,21 June 2021,"With such a great cast, I expected this to be a better movie. I don't know if it was a poor screenplay or muddy direction but the film felt hectic, choppy and melodramatic. I'm sorry to say I haven't read the novel by Daphne du Maurier, which has been such a perennial favourite that it has never been out of print, and, the Hitchcock version of the book won an Oscar in 1940. So, I'm going to hazard a guess it is not the source matter. It's too bad to have wasted the talents of Lily James, Armie Hammer and Kristin Scott Thomas (and a small role for Keeley Hawes).

The last 30 minutes appeared rushed and we didn't really sense what a monster Rebecca must have been.The cinematography and styling were great but the accompanying folk music was both out of place and even intrusive.Of course they changed the ending a little but overall this was a really great movie, a hard seven.",Rebecca

Oddly wooden performances drag the whole mess downwards.The 1940 Hitchcockian/Du Maurier masterpiece should have been left alone.. Laurence Olivier as Maxim, Joan Fontaine as Mrs. De Winter and Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers we perfect casting and had multiple award and nominations.This cast don't even come close but trudge through the leaden dialogue.

If any films should be remade it is the ones that are disappointing. I'm sure that is good logic, but it isn't one that is followed by Hollywood.For those people who aren't familiar with Rebecca it tells the story of the marriage of the De Winters and their home Manderley. Maxim's first marriage was to Rebecca who the new Mrs De Winter wants to know more about. The Manderley house keeper is the spooky Mrs Danvers. The leads are played by Armie Hammer, Lily James and Kristin Scott Thomas. Have to say that Kristin Scott Thomas is rather good as Mrs Danvers, but there isn't much chemistry between Hammer and James.You can't help compare the movie to the classic original and my advice would be to watch the Hitchcock version and give this one a miss.",Rebecca

40,tm-sheehan,Good performances but a pale imitation of the Original,6,22 October 2020,"My Review- "" Rebecca ""My Score 6.5 /10I really was looking forward to this new version of Rebecca mainly because of the excellent cast that includes Lily James as the young and naive ladies maid who becomes the new Mrs De Winter and mistress of Mandalay. This is the role that earned Joan Fontaine her first Academy Award nomination in 1941.
Armie Hammer is suitably dashing as the troubled Maxime De Winter Master of Mandalay the stately mansion where Rebecca ended her days. This role was one of Sir Laurence Olivier's finest Screen performances and also won him an Academy Award Best Actor nomination.
Kristin Scott Thomas is very good as the deranged housekeeper of Mandalay Mrs Danvers who's obsession with her dead mistress Rebecca borders on psychotic. This role in the 1940 film version was brilliantly portrayed by Australian actress Dame Judith Anderson ,who was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress.
The Original 1940 film version of Daphne Du Maurier's best selling novel Rebecca did win the Best Motion Picture Oscar of 1941 and there's a good reason why ,it's a brilliant adaptation filmed in monochrome that suits the Gothic atmosphere of the novel.
This 2020 film version has been described as Downton Abbey on a bad day and I can understand why it's beautifully filmed and uses great locations but it's far from brilliant. Like the horrible 2017 remake of Daphne Du Maurier's My Cousin Rachel this version of Rebecca seems to me to be padded with new plot twists and a little dumbed down . The cast is excellent but I feel like most remakes of Classic films especially if the original was directed by Alfred Hitchcock it's almost impossible to make them work but this one is at least a good attempt.
They tried it with Psycho in 1998 with Gus Van Sant directing and it was a momentous flop this version of Rebecca is much better than that horrible remake of Psycho .
English Director Ben Wheatley certainly is no competition to Hitchcock and on checking his previous work I could see no justification for using him to direct such a famous remake.
It's at times a quite entertaining movie ,especially if you've never seen the original but it really has nothing to justify the expense and frankly all this great talent is wasted.
I did appreciate the little homage to Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 film ""The Birds"" , it couldn't have been accidental and did add a sense of foreboding but pleas don't remake that film.
The set designs costumes and homes in this new adaptation are beautiful
The first house used is the Jacobean-era Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, which was built in 1611 for Robert Cecil, a former statesman in the court of Queen Elizabeth I. Cranborne Manor in Dorset, originally built in 1207 as a hunting lodge, before being remodelled in the 17th century, also for Robert Cecil.
Loseley House, situated in 1,400 acres of countryside near Guildford in Surrey Petworth House in West Sussex, a late 17th-century Grade I listed country house, rebuilt in 1688 by Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset Osterley House is Isleworth, built in the 1570s for banker Sir Thomas Gresham Mapperton House, a Jacobean manor in Devon Blegberry Farm in Devon.
Shooting for the film also took place at Hartland Quay, a rocky seaside area on the North Devon coastline.
Rebecca is well worth a look ,you'll enjoy the performances and the settings but I much prefer the original film. One performance I really didn't like in this movie is the casting of Ann Dowd who was so evil as Aunt Lydia Clements in The Handmaid's Tale as Mrs Van Hopper the wealthy bitchy socialite who employs our young heroine narrator as her personal assistant. It's only a brief but important role at the beginning of the film .
Ann Dowd plays the character as an alcohol soaked broad and unlike Florence Bates in the original just comes across as dead common and left me wondering how she could ever have been accepted in high society.",Rebecca
41,msbreviews,Netflix's version of Rebecca is... weird.,5,21 October 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Netflix's Rebecca is based on the 1938's novel of the same name written by Daphne du Maurier, but it's not its first cinematic adaptation, which leads me to the following shameful statement: I've never seen the famous Alfred Hitchcock's version of this story (nor have I read the novel, but I firmly defend that this doesn't matter). It's the only film of Hitchcock's filmography to have received the Best Picture award, so I admit that I'm much at fault here. However, Ben Wheatley isn't directing a remake of the original movie, but rather another adaptation of the also incredibly popular novel. I was intrigued by the premise, and the cast is definitely convincing, so how did it go?If I had to choose one word to ultimately describe Rebecca right now, it would probably be... weird. More on this in a bit. Starting with the positives, Armie Hammer and Lily James share such vivid chemistry that it elevates the surprisingly compelling bond that their characters form. I write ""surprisingly"" because I'm not easily engaged in most romantic relationships in films, whether these are straight-up romances or mixed up with other genres, like comedy or, as in this case, horror/thriller. Nevertheless, Lily and Armie are able to capture perfectly the growing love interest in one another through the first act, which is entirely dedicated to develop and nurture the key relationship of the movie.This is something I sincerely appreciate: when filmmakers know how to control pacing and how much time should a particular character or storyline receive of build-up. Wheatley does an impressive job during the first half of the film by moving the characters and plot forward at the precise moment they need to. This allows the viewer to understand what the characters are genuinely feeling and why some narrative decisions are made that change the course of the story. Lily James offers a remarkable performance, just like Armie Hammer. Kristin Scott Thomas is also excellent, even though her character is part of my problems with the movie. However, it's the production design that stands out!The beautiful colors and striking landscapes of the French Riviera fill the screen with luxury and harmony during the naturally passionate beginning of the relationship. Once the narrative moves to Manderley, the tone changes to a gradually more depressing, dark environment, accompanied by a creepy score (Clint Mansell), and spooky nightmares. The adequate costumes also help to set the atmosphere, but the beginning of the second half is where things start to get extremely weird.From the very first moment the viewer sets place in Manderley, something is noticeably not right. Everyone addresses the late wife, Rebecca, as the most perfect human being to ever exist, reaching God-like compliments in a clear attempt of trying to create the cliche ""previous wife was amazing, new one is awful, let's make her life a living hell"" storyline. An expected development with exaggeratedly positive comments from the staff. However, it's the horror vibe that embraces the mansion that drives me nuts. Wheatley sets a dark, mysterious, even supernatural environment surrounding the house, a definitely intriguing aspect that leads to a hugely disappointing, hollow, unsatisfactory conclusion.From the first to the second act, the genre in display changes from a fun, lighthearted romance to a horror/thriller featuring a ""haunted"" mansion. The tone change is far from being smooth. However, the third act stores a drastic shift in pretty much everything: tone, genre, story, and even characters. I can't get into details, but it's the most incomprehensible decision in the entire film. The last act not only follows a path that comes from nowhere, but it's also incredibly rushed, concluding the movie in the most disjointed, convoluted way possible.It raises questions related to events and characters in the previous act, it treats Mrs. Danvers very poorly, and ends with a deceiving last shot that makes the viewer think ""did I miss something?"" when the answer is a clear ""no, it's just a weird ending"". Clint Mansell's score is captivating, but its timing is just completely off. It's this feeling of false uncertainty that leaves me frustrated. Why try to make a film about something that it's not? Why try to give Rebecca a horror vibe if it doesn't lead to any impactful outcome? I finished the movie with doubts that have no reason to exist simply because the question should have never been asked by the story in the first place...All in all, Netflix's version of Rebecca gets lost in trying to balance so many genres in just one film. Ben Wheatley does a great job controlling the pacing, offering enough time to develop the main characters and the core relationship. However, the tone changes are far from being well-executed, leading to an utterly absurd, rushed, convoluted last act out of nowhere that raises logical questions and leaves the viewer with a false sense of uncertainty. A well-structured, entertaining first half partially compensates for the weirdness that overflows the second part. Lily James and Armie Hammer deliver great performances, as does Kristin Scott Thomas, but the production design (supported by terrific costumes) steals the spotlight. Clint Mansell's score doesn't go unnoticed, but its placement is exceptionally inefficient. In the end, the attempt at creating a horror atmosphere with the ""haunted"" mansion storyline is so anti-climactic that I can't wholeheartedly recommend this flick...Rating: C",Rebecca
42,MrDHWong,Provides a serviceable update to a classic story for the uninitiated but little more than forgettable thrills for everyone else,6,17 December 2020,"""Rebecca"" is a romantic thriller based on the novel of the same name by Daphne du Maurier. Starring Lily James, Armie Hammer, and Kristin Scott Thomas, it provides a serviceable update to a classic story for the uninitiated but little more than forgettable thrills for everyone else.After their brief courtship in Monte Carlo, the wealthy Maxim de Winter (Armie Hammer) and his new wife (Lily James) move over to Manderley, the large estate of de Winter's family in England. As she tries to adjust to her new life with the upper class, Mrs. de Winter frequently rubs shoulders with Manderley's stern housekeeper Mrs. Danvers (Kristin Scott Thomas), who notifies the former of the untimely death of Mr. de Winter's previous wife Rebecca. Eventually, Mrs. de Winter starts to realise that her husband is not entirely over Rebecca's passing and suspects that her haunting presence still remains at Manderley.There have been various mediums for which Daphne du Maurier's classic 1938 novel have been adapted, ranging from a radio play read by Orson Welles to Alfred Hitchcock's Academy Award winning 1940 feature film. The latter example is probably the most recognised version of this story, as it was helmed by an acclaimed director who became a respected Hollywood figure as a result of its success. Having not read the novel myself, I will be using Hitchcock's film for comparison with this one. With that in mind, this modern 2020 adaptation feels like an inessential and inferior rendition as it sacrifices too many artistic licences for the sake of appealing to today's audiences. Gone is the subtle haunting atmosphere of Hitchcock's film and in its place we have instead surface level imagery obviously intended to provoke the viewer into thinking that something is amiss right away. Sure, this may make the film slightly easier to follow, but it feels like a major part of the original story's identity has been compromised. This lack of imagination may be the sad result of most people today finding it too boring to appreciate the importance of building suspense, which is a huge shame considering the story is littered with moments that revel in such a technique.It feels unfair to compare a director like Ben Wheatley to that of the legendary Alfred Hitchcock but it seems like I have little choice here. Although Wheatley is clearly trying hard to make the film look as nice as possible with creative production design and interesting choices in cinematography, he seldom uses these to his advantage when telling the story. Most of the time it feels as though he is overcompensating for his inability to recapture that feeling of suspense that Hitchcock's film excelled at. Hitchcock was known as ""The Master of Suspense"" so naturally these are big shoes to fill, but there were barely any moments this time around that actually felt filled with tension. As previously mentioned, this film does away with subtlety in favour of a more sensationalistic approach, which detracts from the gothic atmosphere the original was trying to create. That's not to say Wheatley's direction is terrible, it just distinctly lacks the unique flavour that Hitchcock brought to his film eighty years ago.The cast each did a decent job, with Lily James handling her role as the new Mrs. de Winter to the best of her ability. The chemistry between her and Armie Hammer wasn't always believable, but I did care enough about each of them to enjoy watching their escapades together. Hammer's performance, while fine, did feel somewhat off to me. I suppose it's just that he looks so American to me, and although the fake accent he used sounded okay, he stood out to me more as resembling a chiseled football quarterback rather than a member of the English upper class. On the other hand, Kristin Scott Thomas shines the most as Mrs. Danvers. Thomas plays the character with a more sinister undercurrent than that of Judith Anderson in the 1940 film. This made her role in the story considerably more prominent, as in the original there was a much slower build-up to the reveal of her true intentions whereas here it's plain as day she is plotting something from the very beginning.While I certainly wouldn't call it a bad film, this 2020 version of ""Rebecca"" doesn't have enough staying power to recommend it over previous iterations. Taken on its own, it's still a perfectly watchable thriller that perhaps modern viewers unfamiliar with the source material may find some enjoyment in, but anyone who has seen Hitchcock's film will leave convinced that no one else will ever succeed in topping it. It is unlikely this will be the last time we see this classic story adapted into a film, so hopefully future filmmakers will have the hindsight to understand what made it so special in the first place.I rate it 6/10",Rebecca
43,Alexander_Blanchett,More of a soap opera but still decent enough,7,26 October 2020,"It is targeted at a modern audience who can encounter this actually quite terrific story. In its way its more glamourous than the Hitchcock film and build up more as a soap opera rather than a romantic thriller. This is where the film mainly lacks and no I don't compare it to the ""Original"" but that interpretation just worked better for me. This is however not a bad film either. The first half was actually quite great and built up the story wonderfully, but the second half fell rather flat. Everything was rushed and the development of the characters remained ""on the road"". Acting wise it was decent. Armie Hammer was well chosen for this kind of role and played it fine. Lily James had the looks but I am still not too sure of her talent especially in such complex roles as the one of Lady De Winter. She did her best, but it was not a performance to write home about.
The best performance came from Kristin Scott Thomas. You can blame her for being a bit overthetop and her character being a bit too cartoonish but she held herself well against that and a bit of both is also needed for that role. The look was great, sometimes just too perfect and too clean. Nice costumes and great art direction. A fine score by Clint Mansell. Its an okay film but not something that the world needs. At least it was decent entertaining with some atmospheric moments",Rebecca
44,apryla-58795,Never read the book and didn't see the original,8,24 February 2021,"I liked this. I know a lot of people didn't but since I didn't read the book nor did I see the original film I have nothing to compare this to. Taking this at face value I thought it was well acted and interesting. The only issues I have are this:Armie Hammer - they are still trying to make this guy a thing and despite having movie star good looks he's a dud. And now that some disturbing facts have come out about his personal life it's hard to watch him on screen without thinking he's a cad. He has all the elements and looks good on paper but he just doesn't translate on screen.Kristen Scott Thomas is a good actress or is she? She only plays dour angry characters. Her face rarely changes expression. She's wooden and stone faced. She's got a HUUUUGE nose that is really distracting and so she is hard to look at. Everything about her is severe and now that she's got some years on her all you see is the extreme wrinkling on her face and neck due to all the smoking she's done throughout her lifetime. All I see when she's on screen is the wrinkles so I can't focus on her acting. She truly comes across as someone who would be about as fun as a box of rocks.For me I need to like the actors I watch otherwise I can't get into their performances. For instance I LOVE Oliver Platt - even when he's playing an evil character you still like him and you can also see the acting ability because he truly seems like somebody who is a nice fun decent human being IRL so to see him play against that shows true acting. If someone is just naturally a dour killjoy in real life and then they play that on screen that doesn't really show me acting. Most people like to think that many of the so-called good actors in Hollywood are great but they only see them playing one type of character. Anybody would be good if they just played a heightened version of themselves on screen. It's only when you see an actor play against type in several different roles that you see true acting...examples-Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, Tilda Swinton.I would say the only good thing about this was Lily James. She gave a great performance and made it worthwhile.Lastly this house has been in the family for generations so obviously they have tons of money but the house burns down and they just are relegated to living in hotel rooms? I'm not sure why they wouldn't just start rebuilding the place unless it just held too many bad memories for both of them. The ending almost made it seem like they were penniless now and that just didn't make sense. I felt bad for all the staff who spent their lives in service to this family and now they are out on their ears without work. I know it's fiction but still.",Rebecca
45,garethcrook,"Stylish, but...",5,14 December 2020,"I'm going to try and not compare this to its famous predecessor. To be honest, it's been so long since I visited this story, I'm hoping to be able to keep an open mind with Ben Wheatley's reimagining. With Wheatley's track record you'd think you're in safe hands, but even with the sinister elements to this story, it's an altogether different beast to films like Kill List, Free Fire, High-Rise and the excellent Sightseers. This is what they used to refer to in studio parlance as a 'Prestige Picture'. Big budgets, lavish sets, decadence dripping from the screen. Armie Hammer carries this weight well as the charming Maxim de Winter. He cuts that leading man presence. In fact the cast in general are pretty good, perhaps none more than Lily James, who's destined to become the new Mrs de Winter. You see Armie has recently lost his wife, Rebecca and is spending some time in Monte Carlo (see decadent), where he meets his bride to be as she's accompanying the ghastly Mrs Van Hopper (Ann Doud, of Handmaids Tale fame). He's rich and terribly polite. She's young, far from rich and also terribly polite. If it were to go on like this it'd be shockingly dull. It's not going to though is it. They fall in love, get married and head back to his country pile, Mandalay. And so we swap the sun-swept Med with its burnt orange sunsets and white washed walls for the darker, greener climbs of England. It's like stepping back (further) in time. This is all wallpaper though. As much of a presence that Mandalay is. It's it's inhabitants both alive and dead that bring it to life. The formidable Mrs Danvers (Kristin Scott Thomas) is the conduit for all things sinister. The housekeeper at Mandalay, still loyal to the departed Rebecca. She's a little frosty to the new Mrs de Winter, who finds herself living in the shadow of her predecessor, much like this film. Despite Mr de Winter seemingly looking to move on, it's clear he's trapped. The whole house is in a spell. Partly in a sense of duty, but mostly by Danvers. She's the lynchpin character and Scott plays her well, albeit a little obviously. She drives her new mistress bonkers, masking the issues her husband still harbours, as Mrs de Winter (she doesn't get a first name, that's only for Rebecca) finds she's impossible shoes to fill. It's a slick retelling of a maddening story and generally does everything right. It seems lacking heart and and grit though and when you're trying to crank up the psychological tension, that's a problem. Rebecca is an idea of perfection for much of the story and this film seems to be striving for that perfection too. Although it comes up short, that's not to say it's bad. It's a bit long. There's some duff character portrayals, Sam Riley's Jack Favell for one and I'm not quite sure what to make of Sleaford Mods frontman Jason Williamson singing in the kitchen as the toffs party at the ball upstairs. Don't get me wrong, it looks wonderful and the twists still lands with a punch. There's no denying the strength of the story and it grips brilliantly. I just think that modern cinema struggles with tales like this. Too clean, too much knowledge of cinematic tricks, not enough naive experimentation. This was always only ever going to be a rehashing. Wheatley is signed up for more frivolous drudgery, with a Meg and Tomb Raider sequel. I won't watch either, but I imagine they'll be a laugh. He seems all at sea here though.",Rebecca
46,rubenm,An enjoyable update,7,3 January 2021,"'Rebecca' is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most admired films, so it takes guts to remake it in 2020. Anyone following in Hitch's footsteps is sure to be vilified for it. But let's be honest: this is not really a remake of a Hitchcock movie, but a new film version of a novel that has been adapted for the big and small screen several times.I think this version is a very decent one. For one thing, it looks gorgeous. The locations, the clothes, the cars: it's a feast for the eyes. Lead actress Lily James looks the whole time as if she is modeling for a '30's fashion magazine, which is nice. Apart from the looks of the film, the screenplay is also good. Then again, with Du Maurier's material it's hard to go wrong. 'Rebecca' is a story containing everyting it takes for a good film: suspense, character development, an improbable romance, sinister atmosphere and a spectacular ending. The fact that the deceased title character of the film hangs as a shadow over everything that happens, is what made Hitchcock's film such a good movie. But the same goes for the 2020 version.Director Ben Wheatly had to follow in Hitchcock's footsteps, but the lead actors have Lawrence Olivier and Joan Fontaine as examples - both with formidable reputations. I think both did quite well. The emphasis in this film is less on Maxim de Winter. So Armie Hammer's part is secondary to that of Lily James as Mrs. de Winter, the simple girl marrying a rich aristocrat. She succeeds quite well in combining innocent vulnerability and female attractiveness. But the show is stolen by Kristin Scott Thomas as the creepy Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper of the De Winter estate, who radiates hostility while staying polite.After I watched this movie, I put the dvd of Hitchcock's 1940 version in the player. It had quite some nice Hitchcockian moments, but at the same time the melodrama is dated, the acting is stiff and the black & white doesn't do justice to the splendour of De Winter's estate. So in my opinion, the new 'Rebecca' is an enjoyable update.",Rebecca
47,davidgee,Pretty - and pretty silly - remake,6,2 November 2020,"As with Netflix's remake of THE BOYS IN THE BAND I'm wondering: why? The revision doesn't add much that's new - a glamorous cast, lovely locations and colour in place of black-and-white. The story is meant to be ""timeless"", but aren't there any new stories out there waiting to be filmed?Mrs Danvers is the key character. In the 1940 version her obsession with Rebecca was threatening and creepy - it was even possible to read in a lesbian undertone. Kristin Scott Thomas is heroically starchy and becomes subtly sinister, but this year's script makes her more patronizing than obsessive, and the battle between her and the new wife is more a power struggle rather than a study in psychosis.Lily James gives us a feisty Mrs de Winter, but Armie Hammer's transition from attentive boyfriend to absentee husband is unconvincing (his English accent suggests he was voice-coached by Prince William). The melodramatic climax lifts the plot out of a rut but, far from satisfying, it is almost ludicrous. Times have changed, and maybe REBECCA is a bit too dated, and a bit silly, for today's audience. Dated and silly doesn't usually spoil an Agatha Christie remake (looking forward to Kenneth Branagh's new DEATH ON THE NILE) but it doesn't work for this Daphne du Maurier adaptation.",Rebecca
48,mmthos,WHOOSHHHHHHHHH,6,22 October 2020,"That's the sound of this version losing steam just before the end, relative to Hitchcock's 1940 Academy Award winner.
Otherwise, that's the worst I can say about it. Good presentation of the much-loved, much adapted classic novel.
There are nightmarish bits and sequences added here that are not in the earlier film which are on the one hand a novel and original insertion but maybe ultimately gimmicky in their excess, as The New Mrs de Winter's waking life is more terrifying than the relative insubstantiality of mere dreams. There are no glimpses of Rebecca's ghost running down corridors in Hitchcock, yet her presence is constantly, oppressively. almost palpably present.
Another thing this really has going for it is inclusion of the novel's key plot point, which Hitchcock could not use due to the moral prohibitions of the Hollywood Code then in place, but if anyone could pull off getting round that it was Hitchcock and a stellar team of screenplay writers and adapters
Armie Hammer certainly looks the part of a 1930's aristocratic millionaire hunk but lacks the fire of Olivier's impassioned performance. Lily James gives an admirable current day performance, almost the performance Joan Fontaine would have given if she were a contemporary actress in our contemporary cinema. Ann Dowd as the future New Mrs. de Winter's former protectress/employer, an affected Grande Dame spinster is equally delightfully detestable as 1940's great character actress Florence Bates. 1940's George Sanders is simply irreplaceable in any role he ever took, but Sam Riley manages to hold his own doing it his own way.
Then there's Kristin Scott-Thomas. If anyone was ever up to attempting a role Dame Judith Anderson made a byword, it's her, although Agnes Moorehead did it in a radio adaptation, which also has to be entered in the competition for who did it best. Not blessed, in this case, with the Dame's renowned, shall we say, lack of beauty, instead Ms Scott-Thomas compensates by breathing all the more fiery venom, while remaining chillingly cool as a cucumber tea sandwich. She exudes the air of an evil Mary Poppins FROM HELL! .
Two BIG plusses for Hitchcock's: Franz Waxman's soaring score, and George Barnes Oscar-winning Beautiful B&W cinematography. Totally dark black shadows and unlit corridors draw and compel while simultaneously inducing terrible and inescapable fear, something random hues from a prism, no matter how dim, never can.
Back to the end, I know the original novelist Daphne Du Maurier wrote one ending for the book, and another for her own adaptation for a dramatic presentation, but did no work on any other of the film/radio/tv projects based on ""Rebecca"". I've never read the book, only seen the 1940 and 2020 movies, so have no idea if these follow either of her endings, but for me, between the two options presented by these two films, a Fiery End makes an incomparable impression compared to a soggy dunk in the Deep .",Rebecca
49,danielmanson,The film just had 0 spark,4,31 October 2020,"Yeah, to be honest this film was incredibly underwhelming for me and I'll tell you why.The film, as stated in the title, lacked any sort of spark. At no point in the film do you get hooked in by the plot and eagerly sit awaiting the next part.There is no need for it to be that long. The film felt very long winded and the middle hour of the film could genuinely be condensed into about 4 minutes.the film is classed as a thriller and I have no idea how. More like a romance period piece. The ""twist"" is very underwhelming and you are led to believe that there's a ghost/spirit roaming about and the film is heading in that direction. It doesn't in the slightest, which renders so many conversations and plots null.-the final 20 minutes of the film is so out the blue, I really don't see the point of the vast majority of the film.Couple of positives to take is that the acting I thought was very good.

In this bratty hipster remake the splendour of the actual mansion
Takes a backseat. It's like watching whatever christmas movie. Rebecca Is for whatever reason lit In dreadful cheap red, blue and orange tones. It's like watching those bratty opposite color match explanation videos on youtube from 18 year old movie students that think they have figured It all out. When photo and color In movies like Ad Astra and recent Rebecca tries to be hip. It doesn't become a second thought. It's the very first obvious thing that comes to mind.

The saviour of this remake is Kristen Scott Thomas who is terrific as the twisted Danvers. Armie Hammer is as basic as you can get and honestly after his snarky remarks about Hitchcock's version, he doesn't deserve to be apart of such a film. Lily James delivers a good performance but ultimately she becomes an annoyance by the end. Overall this film looks good but doesn't deliver as it should.

From the start it's a glamorous romance set in the 30s, there's the costumes the cars and even the picturesque views look like a postcard from the 30s. But instead of wishing you were here, you'll be wishing you were gone, because the remake denies any existence it was even made from the original source material, and although you've got the Hitchcockian aspects it doesn't quite have the flair but then there's no Lawrence Olivier here.

2020
12A
Director: Ben Wheatley
Starring: Lily James, Armie Hammer, Kristin Scott Thomas, Keeley Hawes, Bryony Miller, Tom Goodman Hill, Sam Riley etcOverall rating 81/100Rebecca is based on two newly weds called Mrs De winter (Lily James) and Maxim ( Armie Hammer) who upon arriving to his family estate learns about his past with his dead wife as secrets unravel. I really enjoyed Rebecca and I thought It was a cleverly crafted and entertaining movie so lets get started.First of all, the cinematography, set pieces, chemistry between characters and performances were fantastic. This movie looked visually stunning, the fantastically crafted shots with the atmospheric use of lighting and fog was just excellent, the set pieces were also beautiful, wherever this was set I want to go, the manor was absolutely breath-taking and was also a great place for multiple different parts of the manor and for the mystery to unfold. I thought the characters were very likeable and had excellent chemistry with each other. The character played by Lily James was so incredibly likeable you instantly sympathised with her situation before meeting Maxim and just had a fun and unique charm to her Lily James and Armie Hammer did fantastic performances here and had fantastic on screen chemistry with each other, there relationship felt very organic and real and they worked very well together, the performance from Kristin Scott Thomas was also excellent, she was incredibly unsettling and switched from sweet and smiley to menacing and cold so excellently she was a fantastic antagonist.My next few positives would be the mysterious and unsettling tone and the development of the mystery. I loved the mystery this movie created, the fact that they left so much out about Rebecca and her relationship with Armie Hammers character was excellent, I was genuinely intrigued and on the edge of my seat throughout, the movie also created a very unsettling tone, the constant comparison between Lily jame's character and Rebeca and the fact that the residents of the manor almost acted like she was still there was terrifying and gave the movie a supernatural feel to it that worked really well, I also loved how the mystery developed, I loved that they slowly revealed more and more things about Rebeca and the movie constantly left you questioning characters and leaving hints which was great and there was always enough new reveals to keep you constantly interested.My few negatives for the movie that bought it down slightly would be the unneeded characters, rushed character decisions and lack of depth to the more interesting themes. I felt like there was a few characters that didn't really contribute much towards the plot the lady who Lily james's was travelling with didn't contribute anything towards the plot and just felt very unnecessary to her character, I also found that the rushed character decisions between Maxim and Mrs de winter effected the pacing, the fact that their relationship moved so fast and too fast for a normal relationship it made the first act feel very rushed and more messy compared to the rest of the movie which didn't have these issues. I also found the movie lacked depth to it's more interesting themes and played it safe in places, the more interesting class themes were not explored and due to the class differences between both main characters I wish this was more well explored.My final few positives would be the clever links between the characters, plot twists and final act. I loved the links that the movie made between Lily james and her character as well as Rebecca, the constant comparison with her character almost unintentionally doing actions similar to Rebecca was excellently executed and the conflict that caused was pieced together perfectly within the film, the plot twists were also excellent, I never saw any of them coming and was genuinely surprised at the direction the movie went, but it raised the stakes and drama well and further cemented the movies cleverness and attention to detail with it's mystery leading to a shocking and entertaining final act that left an impact.Overall, despite playing it slightly safe with it's themes and a few character issues, Rebecca is a visually stunning, excellently acted and phenomenally crafted movie that has a mystery that will keep you constantly on edge and entertained.",Rebecca
61,nammage,A Bit Skiddish,6,22 October 2020,"I love the story of 'Rebecca' and the 1940 film is one of my favorite films. Hitchcock did that story remarkably well. I actually preferred Hitchcock's version to the novel; don't get me wrong, I loved the novel but in the confines of what Hitchcock had to work in he did a marvelous job at making one immersed in the story.The production value in this is well done. I even think the actors were the right choice for the roles but it seemed too modern even in its setting. The haunting aspect didn't come soon enough. I think it would have worked better if they started at the house in retrospect of the narration; though in the novel it was more of a remembrance after Manderlay burned down and they were living abroad.Gothic style doesn't necessarily mean dark and gloomy; everything in this is bright and shiney, for the most part, and that didn't bother me. 'Rebecca' to me was always a love story first and a psychological thriller second. The love story being between the new Mrs. De Winter and Max rather than Rebecca and Max because Max never loved Rebecca and Rebecca only loved herself, if even that. Mrs. Danvers loved Rebecca because they were basically the same person: cruel-hearted.Overall, it's a nice effort but doesn't stand up to the novel nor Hitchcock's version. What I think people could have gotten into is a prequel to 'Rebecca'. Or at least, I could.",Rebecca
62,Rendanlovell,Rewrite this,4,31 October 2020,"Is a good thing dogs exist in these movies. How else would our characters find things they shouldn't? I like Lilly James, I like Armie Hammer, and I like Ben Wheatley but I didn't like this. After an explosive opening act stuffed with as much romance as possible, it grinds to a halt.After that opening act, which could be a full movie on its own, it turns into vague mystery drama. Girl gets married to guy who refuses to talk about his past wife who somehow everyone loved. It's the type of movie that gets old after the first vague story told by one of the house workers. That is the entirety of the film unfortunately.Scene after scene we watch Lilly James overacting in various rooms while listening to people jabber. It's painfully tedious. Even with the gorgeous locations and nice cinematography it can't maintain any energy. Any time there's a new ""reveal"" it feels as unimportant as the last. Which there aren't many of in the first place.This just doesn't give any reason to get into the story. The Rebecca character that is constantly talked about isn't compelling to me. Everyone loved her, ok, so what? Not only that, but Lilly James is horribly uninteresting. She has no character or arch. She is a tool to be used in the story. Don't write like this. And if your story is a string of scenes where people talk at the main character, change it.",Rebecca

64,themadmovieman,A bold new vision of a classic tale that goes down so sweetly,8,19 October 2020,"Just as the new Mrs. de Winter lives in fear of being in Rebecca's shadow, so too could this film have been anxious about living up to the reputation of Alfred Hitchcock's legendary 1940 adaptation. However, Ben Wheatley's new vision of the classic tale is as enthralling as it is utterly gorgeous, exchanging the cold mental torment of Hitchcock's version for a sprawling and elegant cinematic style that goes down so sweetly.There's no denying the brilliance of Hitchcock's Rebecca, with its psychologically tortuous drama and claustrophobic atmosphere, but the way that Ben Wheatley has taken this story and projected a different yet equally suitable vision onto it is an absolute delight, allowing you to relive the same story as if you'd never seen it before.Complete with gorgeous visuals, an elegant musical score and irresistible performances across the board, this new adaptation of Rebecca is certainly brighter than Hitchcock's, but that doesn't mean it lacks the riveting drama that makes this story so great.Starting off in beautiful fashion with a sun-baked prologue that follows the beginning of Maxim and his new wife's courtship, Rebecca immediately shows off its stylish and sprawling visuals that pulls you into the fairy tale romance of a lifetime.When we arrive at Manderley House and things begin to turn darker, however, the film maintains its gorgeous style, and never remains quite as confined as Hitchcock's version of the story did.Of course, there's a trade-off there which means this film doesn't have the same mentally distressing sense of claustrophobia and paranoia, but it does prove a whole lot more spectacular, with faster pacing and high-stakes drama that make it an enormously entertaining watch all the way through.At times, this Rebecca has something of Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby about it, with immense style playing a big part in making it such a great watch. But the film is more than just a pretty face, and manages to engross you in its story of mental insecurity and fear in irresistible fashion.What's more, the film features a fantastic ensemble cast including Lily James and Armie Hammer, who are both spectacular, as well as Kristin Scott Thomas, who proves just as fearsome and unnerving as Mrs. Danvers as Judith Anderson did in the 1940 film.Coupled with Clint Mansell's elegant yet still uneasy musical score and production design that works perfectly at both the film's sunniest and darkest moments, and you have a bold new vision of Rebecca that's enormously refreshing, and just as satisfying as what we've seen before.I'd hesitate to say that Wheatley's and Hitchcock's adaptations are worlds apart, but they do very different things. The original, in true Hitchcock fashion, is an intoxicating psychodrama that's thrilling but extremely uncomfortable.Wheatley, on the other hand, crafts a film that's a lot of fun to be drawn into, and while he may not manage to provide the same level of mental anguish, he makes up for it by telling a great story in thoroughly entertaining fashion.Overall, I'm delighted to say that I absolutely loved Rebecca. I never expected to see the film match what Hitchcock did 80 years ago, but with a bold new vision that features a gorgeous, sprawling cinematic style, brilliant performances and enthralling drama, it's an immensely entertaining watch.",Rebecca

My biggest gripe was the characters, which I'll try to explain without giving away anything important. The main guy (Maxim) is supposed to be all charming and sauve, but almost everything he does is obnoxious and rude. And we're supposed to believe his wife would love him? Maybe they could've done a better job building their relationship because any sane woman would've left him immediately.

The guy made the amazingly inventive and unsettling A Field in England. Why he decided to take this on i dont know because there is clearly no passion there from his point of view. We see a very small glimpse of his dynamic style at the ball but this is all otherwise is a nuts n bolts affair.The performance are all fine but nothing outstanding or interesting.

The characters were just so blah. I literally cared more about Clarice the maid than the lead characters. She seemed nice which is at least an adjective, I can't really think of any adjectives to describe Mr and Mrs de Winters. So that tells you something.I was really looking forward to the costumes too but for the most part I was let down. They stuck Mrs de Winter in like dumpy hats and cardigans that you could go and pick up from H & M. I don't understand this choice. In the Hitchcock film they give her interesting dresses and stylish tops. I was so confused.I also don't believe the reviews that say this captures old Hollywood. I didn't feel it, it 100% felt like a 2020 film. If you want a old Hollywood movie just go and watch one.I would honestly skip it, it was pretty confused. The first chunk of the movie felt like full romance but then it shifts into like a boring drama then it's all like Frankensteined together with horror tropes like ""jump scares"".

77,grahamvr,NOT A MASTERPIECE,4,24 October 2020,"I think it's fair to say this new version of REBECCA is another distasteful attempt by Netflix to destroy the classics. First it was Hill House, then Bly Manor (Turn of the Screw) and now Daphne DuMauriers novel. The first 90 mins plods along changing the original dialogue at times to the wrong character which isn't too bad but then the story starts to go downhill for the last 30 minutes. The ending is a travesty and the director and writer should be barred from ever doing a movie again. The actors are quite pathetic in their roles.How a director or writer has the right to change the ending of a story is beyond me. I am sure when he sent Lily James to see the doctor for information at the ending was just to give her a bigger part in her role. Then we come to the fire, what a shame to see such really bad visual effects and then the final nail in the coffin on a high cliff overlooking the ocean.Hitchcock's version of REBECCA is still considered a masterpiece and won a Best Picture Academy Award in 1940. I watched this version again on YouTube after viewing the Netflix one. It's amazing how a film made in black and white with top stars of the day achieved such fame. Music scores in movies today have practically gone, replaced by stupid songs which never seem to have anyone to do with the story. I'm not saying the new version had songs in it but the music score was nothing compared to the original. Hitchcock, the master of suspense made the use of music and cinematography to create a suspenseful mystery thriller.SHAME.....SHAME.....SHAME.......",Rebecca

The negative reviews seem to split into two camps - its not as good as the book, or not as good as Hitchcocks version.

The director revealed too much too soon (with the character's demeanors and personalities not being more subtle) and he didn't invest enough time in the details of the plot, so the audience doesn't get to experience the full mystery this movie should be.

85,mbhgkmsgg,Rebecca,4,18 November 2020,"Spectacularly underwhelming. Rebecca is style over substance from start to finish. And while the style is nice, that's where the good things end. There is nothing in this film that made me care about it.I'm still struggling to figure out what this movie was trying to be. It started as a thriller, nearing horror at times with its haunted house setting. Then it moved more towards being a love drama, after which it tried to turn into a murder mystery. There was so much going on, that it's no wonder that none of it worked. I liked the idea of the haunted house, but it never managed to be scary. It never managed to be even remotely tense. Things happened without any consequence or meaning.
And as for the rest of the movie, there is very little to say about it. The film jumps from one genre and idea to another so quickly that it becomes impossible to follow any intention that the film had, let alone care about it.Another thing that really bothered me was the characters. There wasn't a single one that I liked. Perhaps that is the case in the source material as well but in the context of this movie, having no one to care about made it impossible to care about the movie. The film tried to make me invested with an incredibly drawn-out sequence in the beginning, but it managed to make zero impact. By the end of it, I cared just as little about the characters as I did in the beginning. Which, as far as I'm concerned, is a bit of an issue in a movie that is completely character-driven.But it wasn't all bad. As mentioned, Rebecca very clearly prioritized style over substance. Thankfully the style worked. It was a very nice looking film. It was obvious that a lot of care had been taken to get the setting and mood right. Unfortunately, style and visuals can only get you so far. Had the film managed to make me care even in the slightest, the visuals would've made it a much better experience than it had any right to be. But as is, the look of the film gets drowned out by the mess that is the rest of the film.The biggest problem is that Rebecca tries to be too many things at the same time. As a result, everything ends up feeling watered down and shallow. There is no central thread that the viewer can grab onto, nor does it give you any reason to care about it. And no matter how nice the visuals and the look of the film are, they aren't enough to pull this film out of the mess it made of itself.",Rebecca

""Rebecca"" is the pandemic version: Just look, but don't touch. We want to visit those places, but we can't right now, so this movie is good enough. Unfortunately, that's about all it's good for - the scenery and a couple of acting performances. It's interesting to see Aunt Lydia from ""The Handmaid's Tale"" fame as a spoiled socialite.

The crime element of this story was completely ridiculous. When Rebecca trespasses and illegally obtains evidence proving Rebecca had late-stage cancer at the time of her ""suicide"", the judge forgets about the $10,000 bribery check the two leads offered another character. The story everyone eventually accepts is REALLY that the victim messed up her own boat and drowned herself, instead of simply jumping off a cliff. There are so many threads that went nowhere, including dogs barking at what seemed to be nothing (I know at one point the dog was barking at someone hidden in the boat house), but why did the dog run all the way there?

94,antony-1,"A strong take on the themes of the book, but not without some issues",8,24 January 2021,"I see that it averages 6 stars at the moment, which is unjust. I suspect without seeing the reviews that a lot of people will be comparing to the last movie (naturally) and Hitchcock has a fanatical following. And Hitchcock's movie is a brilliant, iconic movie. One of the best movies of all time.But it was also very Hitchcock movie - his voice came through strong, the noir thriller very present.With this remake I felt Daphne De Maurier's voice was heard more strongly than before.Where it really excels is that claustrophobic feeling of Rebecca. A young nameless woman subsumed by Rebecca at every turn. Mrs Danvers is more nuanced too, less outright-crazy and more obsessive in this turn. Kristin Scott Thomas is a delight.There are some issues that detract. The age gap between the lead actors is a real problem. For me part of the narrative is that it's a much older man taking a young, naïve woman as his wife. Here the ages are very close, and as such its loses a big dynamic.The revelation and about turn of the main character is a bit too quick. And indeed Lily James was good but not quite as vulnerable as I feel she should be. Indeed she felt quite modern with a fire underneath, and I'm not sure it quite works in terms of the journey. I could do without a couple of lazy plot devices such as dreams and flashbacks to tell the story.But all in all this is a very good adaptation. It doesn't tell a hugely different story to Hitchcock's, but it is different if you look closely and listen to the themes. It's well directed and effective, and Daphne De Maurier shines through and for that alone I applaud it. Judge the movie on its own merits.",Rebecca

96,mgumsley,Disappointing retake on a classic tale,6,24 October 2020,"The huge budget used for this movie has meant the overall production is very lavish and it is a great pity this was not shown on the big screen - those scenes shot in France and around the English coast would have been glorious. I do remember the original which was quite low budget but was full of brooding suspense and the brilliant presence of Olivier and Fontaine. What a shame, then, that Lily James and Armie Hammer, who are such an attractive couple, failed to light up the screen. I loved Armie's English accent which was quite low key, and Lily gave a good performance, they just seemed to lack chemistry together. Which gave Kristen Scott Thomas the perfect opportunity to steal the show as the nasty Mrs Danvers. Thank goodness Keeley Hawes was on hand to give some light relief here and there, even if she seemed to be laughing at herself some of the time.

98,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Rebecca or The Haunting on Manderley Abbey,5,24 October 2020,"This week Netflix released a remake of an Alfred Hitchcock classic, Rebecca, that stars Lily James and Armie Hammer as the main couple at the center of the story. The film is based on a novel by Daphne du Maurier that has been on high school reading lists for decades though I've never read it or seen the Hitchcock version. I didn't know exactly what I was getting into, but I expected thrills, maybe a ghost and a tense mystery. Here's what I actually got.The basic premise of Rebecca is that a rich guy, Maxim de Winter (Hammer), falls for a young lady's companion (James) while on vacation and their swooning romance becomes an impulsive commitment. Maxim is a widower still troubled by his wife, Rebecca's death; but, he brings the new Mrs. de Winter to his estate, Maderley, where the specter of Rebecca lingers and clings to the shady housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Thomas). Hijinks ensue.Supposedly, there's a mystery surrounding the circumstances of Rebecca's death. We hear whispers, but get no real details. Mrs. Danvers acts very strangely and disapproving of the new Mrs. de Winter, but the sneering portrayal while good doesn't really enhance the material. Both Lily James and Kristin Scott Thomas fill their roles admirably. James plays the doe-eyed rube well. She reminds me of the charm she had from her days in Downton Abbey. Thomas gets to be icy and almost menacing. Her obsession with Rebecca is palpable, but it is not really clear why she is so stuck on her - it feels just like a power trip. Hammer just fills the role of window dressing - any actor could have played that part. He and Lily James do look good together and have some good moments, but she gets the credit for selling the romance aspect of this film.The look of Rebecca is really well done though. Manderley is a stunning estate inside and out. It has that English stateliness of a Downton Abbey, but it also is creepy - too big to be cozy and so many rooms. There are shots that are on cliffs that are beautiful and scary at once. The sprawl of all that is going on fills the screen so wonderfully. They really spent their money well on that aspect. If the plot were as interesting as the craft of the film, then this would be a real winner.Ultimately, Rebecca is a passable film for 2 hours. It is not entirely engrossing, but it isn't boring either. It takes a while to get to the point and for the mystery to develop, but even then, it feels like an afterthought. On a gloomy autumn evening, you could do worse with a handful of popcorn than watch Rebecca. Give it a try.",Rebecca

Overall the film just feels bland.",Rebecca
100,PeachesIR,Not as bad as the critics say,6,23 October 2020,"This glossy new version of ""Rebecca,"" based on the late Daphne du Maurier's hit novel, was entertaining, if flawed due to some of the performances and pacing. The costumes, scenery and sets, particularly in the South of France and the main characters' lavish Cornwall estate, Manderley. Lily James is beautiful, but tends to overact, or perhaps she seems to use the same expressions and emotions in every role? ""Rebecca"" is meant to be very melodramatic, and her character is suffering through emotional anguish due to some nasty gaslighting by Manderley's dastardly housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (played with razor-sharp glee by Kristin Scott-Thomas, who steals the show in the showiest role--and pulls no punches), so perhaps James' hair-pulling and blouse-clutching makes sense. She lays it on a little thick, even though ""Rebecca"" is set in the 1930s when young, middle-class English women would have been more naive and impressionable, not so sophisticated or feisty as modern women. Armie Hammer looks gorgeous and terribly pained as Maxim de Winter, but I'm not sure he has a great deal of chemistry with James. The early scenes in the Cote d'Azur were the most compelling part, not only for the lush scenery (who wouldn't fall in love in such a setting?), but the depiction of how the two main characters kindle their romance.I wonder if a story like ""Rebecca"" is just too hokey and old-fashioned for contemporary movie audiences. Can 21st century women relate to an unnamed ingenue who's out of her depth as the mistress of a huge English country estate, selecting sauces for the beef, directing the staff, and planning lavish costume balls? Not to mention dealing with a super-toxic housekeeper and a distant, aristocratic hubby? I have seen the classic 1940 version of ""Rebecca,"" directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and I agree that Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier had more chemistry than version's stars, and Hitchcock's pacing really amped up the tension. But the main drawback may just be that ""Rebecca"" is a hokey old story that doesn't age so well.",Rebecca

Thankfully the changes were small and unimportant so I didn't have anything to worry about.I've not heard of the two main actors and the bloke playing max did a good job. The actress playing the second Mrs De W (her name is never revealed in the book) was OK, but surely there are better actresses out there?

Some of the landscape of beautiful Cornwall seemed CGI, just no real. Great seeing Tim Goodman Hiil and Keely HawesAll in all, a good drama but knowing the story and the twist means it's not as exciting for me, especially having seen the dark Hitchcock film too.

While it may not have the sleek polish of a 1940's movie with the unparalleled Laurence Olivier, this is a very worthy attempt.For those who criticize the Lily James character of the ""new Mrs. DeWinter,"" she is supposed to be ""jumpy"" and unsure of herself. That is the character. Armie Hammer brought a posh sophistication that also impressed me, since he was the casting choice I questioned the most, and Kristin Scott Thomas was delightfully creepy.It's been years since I read the book, but I'm downloading it soon to reread.

113,annlevtex,Gothic Goes Glamorous,6,22 October 2020,"I won't complain about the lovely costumes and scenery, the gawkable high-end interiors or the attractive cast. Lily James' costumes are to die for, even the demure little blouses and tweed skirts she wears when she returns to Manderly with her dashing husband Maxim. If anything, the actors are TOO pretty, especially Armie Hammer. Yes, James' bobbed blonde hair is glaringly fake against her brown eyes and crisp dark eyebrows (seriously, WHY do they always make her a blond?), but at least the style is period appropriate and highlights her sensible wardrobe and English Rose prettiness. But Hammer's towering, hunky frame, chiseled face and big baby blues make him look more like a GQ model in a Ralph Lauren ad than a 1930s English Posho. His accent is passable, as is his acting. He and James both give perfectly good, if not masterful, performances. They have chemistry and I rooted for their marriage to make it. They make a nice couple. The problem is, they're in the wrong movie.""Rebecca"" is supposed to be a Gothic thriller, not a romantic adventure. Which is not to say it can't have a love story embedded in it. ""Jane Eyre"" is a love story, but Rochester is a genuinely dark character, and real danger looms (literally) above the heroine's head. Here, the second Mrs. De Winter allows herself to be cowed by Kristen Scott Thomas's (excellent) Mrs. Danvers, who, while disdainful, icy and manipulative, does not seem mentally unhinged enough to be truly terrifying. Even the house itself is just a large, old manor house full of portraits and servants standing at attention....remarkable to a young woman from a humbler background, but not to anyone who has watched other English period pieces. James' character is a fish out of water. Intimidated by her surroundings, especially the wing/rooms that belonged to her predecessor, yes. Unnerved by her husband's uncommunicative moodiness and sleepwalking, yes. But haunted? Driven to near madness? I'm not convinced.The sinister sexual undercurrents of Hitchcock's version are also missing. They really only rear their heads when the talk and action turn to horses (sorry!). It seems that whereas Mrs. DW2 doesn't even know how to ride., the aristocrat Rebecca, as Mrs. D tells her in racy detail, could break any stallion. Ahem. So when Rebecca's dissolute Toff of a cousin (Sam Riley, very good) shows up and sweeps the young bride up onto a horse in front of him for an impromptu lesson, squeezing her thigh and tossing off comments like ""just move with me"" and ""you'll be sore tonight"" with (almost) comic creepiness, I was kind of delighted at the diversion. She almost seems more scared here than at any other time, and I don't blame her. Honestly, I think Riley would have been better cast as Maxim. Hammer's version is just too darned wholesome.And speaking of shifts! (Again, sorry). About 3/4 of the way through the movie, there is a massive Info Dump and the train suddenly switches tracks, lurches off in another direction entirely and goes in and out of a few shadowy tunnels before almost unceremoniously dumping the viewer out at its destination, where I at least was left blinking in the sun. Twists and turns in a mystery are a good thing, and of course the end is supposed to be a surprise. But here, the characters turn on a dime. All at once she, at least, is almost a different person, their relationship transformed. She puts on a (gorgeous) tweed suit and does a whole Nancy-Drew-Goes-Noir bit for about five minutes, revelations come fast and furious, and......here we are! Wait, what? Where? The end, tacked on from the original, is satisfying in a way, but also random.The movie is engaging and beautiful. No one embarrasses himself or herself. If you like the book, like period pieces and mysteries and lovely things, then watch it. But don't expect to be on the edge of your seat. This isn't one for the ages.",Rebecca

Ofcourse it would be unfair to compair it with the Oscar winning Hitchcock classic but this adaption is decent in its way ! Lily James looks stunning throughout and delivers a decent performance. The lady as Mrs. Denver's delivers a brilliant performance ! The film though lacks the eerie atmosphere of the original one and the uneven editing at times with scenes moving from one doesn't do good either ! However the emotive part involving the two leads is pretty good. The ending feels a bit rushed and no way could match the original .

The one constant they seem to have in common is that they do not like movies which are not in color. So we get this pathetic remake. And like 90% of all remakes it makes one cringe when compared to the original. Skip this rape of a classic and watch the original 1940 masterpiece instead. No, it's not in color.

Still good to see how very classic filmmaking he has in his set of talents as well. Because this is what it is, quite straightforward, classic filmmaking in correspondence with the classic theme, reference and period. In many ways this works out alright, the cast is great, setting, costume design phenomenal. Suspense is there but weirdly, from the ball onwards it changes the pace, depth and how clearly the audience can understand conflict within the plot. I guess this is the issue with quite a lot of made-for-streaming-content: rushed and too much based on audience orientation, giving writers and directors not enough time and space to develop it properly.",Rebecca

131,lowefreddy,A fine effort. Well done!,8,19 February 2021,"This film more than deserves its place within the canon of Daphne du Maurier adaptations. Some books are easy to adapt and some are almost impossible. ""Rebecca"", sadly, is one of those that is incredibly difficult simply because it works so well as a piece of written fiction. These filmmakers did the best they could. There is a clear endeavour here to stick closely to the novel, incorporate modern production values, get good actors in, not make the film too long, and produce an all-round enjoyable viewing experience. And so they did. No, it is not the best film ever made, and no it is not as good as the book - but those goals were nigh-on unachievable in the first place. You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't when it comes to adapting famous classic literature.The standout is, of course, the wonderful Kristin Scott Thomas as Miss Danvers. She is superb. Kristin Scott Thomas as a villain is something that would never have occurred to me beforehand, and a combination I now appreciate very much! What a sinister slippery snake. I love how they added a bit more of her at the end of the film - no spoilers - and surprisingly it gave her character a bit more pathos (despite being a cow).
Lily James is convincing as the second Mrs de Winter. She gets the naïveté and innocence spot-on, as well as the sudden maturing at the end of the story. They give her and Maxim lots more sex appeal than in the novel - Hollywood will be Hollywood, sex gets audiences in - and she is a lot more glamorous than how I imagined her, but don't let it bother you.
Armie Hammer as Maxim perhaps lacks the necessary wit and charisma (which, again, he makes up for in physical charisma!) of du Maurier's Maxim, but it's still a good performance.
Sam Riley as Favell - you recognise him because he was in Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, also starring Lily James.A fine effort! 8/10 - would recommend.",Rebecca
132,jacqueestorozynski,What a disappointment,3,22 October 2020,"I was looking forward to this production as a fan of the book and the Hitchcock film and was wondering what a new version would add to it. The answer is - nothing, apart from a bit of sex on the beach ( not the cocktail). The two leads were totally uncharismatic. I am not familiar with Armie Hammer as an actor, he gave a creditable performance and looked handsome. Unfortunately, it wasn't of Maxim De Winter. There was no class, he was much too gentle and friendly and when he admitted how much he hated Rebecca, he just came over as a wimp. Lily James played the part of the un-named second wife as a school girl, why on earth would Maxim be interested in her. There was no gothic tension, Manderley appeared to be a large open library, as everyone trecked through a large tiled hallway that went on for ages. There was some beautiful photography of the South of France, but the restaurant refusing to serve the paid companion because she wasn't a guest was nonsense. She had a room at the hotel. After the first hour, I began to be bored and lost interest, but felt duty bound to stick with it to the end.
I liked the performance of the cad by Sam Riley and it took me ages to work out where I had seen him before and then remembered it was the TV mini series SS-GB. However, in that he had a deep gravelly voice, damaged it was said at the time for singing Heavy Metal. Now he has morphed into SImon Williams.
Everything dragged on and then was wound up quickly - a case of they think it's all over, it is now. If she was alive, Daphne Du Maurier must wonder where she went wrong.",Rebecca
133,ChrisScreenwriter,SPOILERS HERE,6,23 October 2020,"Hey wait a minute, they CHANGED THE ENDING?In the book, they live a life of sad ennui, not particularly happy as they fade into the sunset without Manderley. A happy ending is not Rebecca! So I only gave it a 6.",Rebecca
134,Flippitygibbit,Style over substance,3,21 October 2020,"There's a lot to be said for keeping your expectations low, but Rebecca (2020) was a bit of a mess. I'm sure there will be edits and gifs galore because the house(s) used for Manderley - including my favourite Loseley Park - and the 30s-ish costumes are very pretty, however that doesn't stop this being yet another style over substance adaptation. And I'm judging this on Daphne Du Maurier's novel, not the 1940 film version.Let's see. The narrator's lack of confidence does not sit well on Lily James and that aspect of the character has almost been done away with anyway, to give her agency. She isn't baffled as to why Maxim wants to marry her because he's already shagged her on the beach, so 'I'm asking you to marry me, you little idiot' is made somewhat redundant (he'd better be!) And Lily's character also has more clothes than even Maxim, with his hideous suits, so Mrs D and Bea can hardly accuse her of being mousey and downtrodden. Armie Hammer is a plodding Maxim who seems bizarrely in love with his wife from the get-go, carrying her over the threshold and snogging her in front of the staff. A weirdly garish Mrs Van Hopper can run rings around him in Monte, so watching Maxim later take a back seat and wait for his wife to spring him from jail is hardly surprising. Everyone is raving over Kristin Scott Thomas as Mrs Danvers, and I suppose she is a highlight, but her character is more of a Margaret Thatcher clone than the disturbed housekeeper of the story. When she asks, 'Does he brush your hair?' she sounds like she's taking a survey. And don't get me started on how Jack Favell is presented as sympathetic swain - he bizarrely takes Rebecca's replacement for a riding lesson, after dashing to the stables to intone 'Rebecca was the only one who could tame you' to a wild horse. Okaaay.The plot can't decide between sepia-tinted romance and horror film - between the sleepwalking, a secret door to Rebecca's morning room, Lily slicing her hand open on the broken cupid, and Rebecca's body being hauled past the whole town in a tarp, I thought I was watching yet another haunted house series. There's also a healthy dash of Downton Abbey, with the new Mrs DW traipsing down to the servant's kitchen every five minutes, including a confrontation with Mrs Danvers (or 'Danvers!' as Maxim calls her) over Jack Favell, because reminding the viewers that servants are people too is very woke. And the final scenes are a complete disaster - the inquest and Rebecca's note to Favell are hopelessly muddled so that Maxim is thrown in jail and Lily's character has to find the name of Rebecca's doctor and STEAL HER MEDICAL FILE to set him free. I don't even know what that scene achieved, apart from showing sisters doing it for themselves.The real test is Maxim's confession, which was diluted by the Hays Code in the 1940 film, but this version is still weak. Instead of goading Maxim into a fury, Rebecca hands him a gun and tells him to shoot her. So he does. (He loads the same gun, presumably, while telling his new wife how he killed the last one and gives her the same option of killing him.) Lily's chirpy final narration - 'But this morning I woke up and left the dead behind!' - also sort of kills the moody vibes of the novel. We know the De Winters are living abroad when she dreams of Manderley, but are they happy? Between the misplaced feminist notes - Caroline De Winter of the portrait, now in a red dress, was 'one of the first women to qualify as a doctor', apparently - and stylish scenery like Rebecca's art deco hall of mirrors boudoir, this new take quite literally glosses over the original novel, with a bizarre soundtrack that includes both 'Pennies from Heaven' and 1970s folk band Pentangle. But at least I didn't pay £8.99 to be disappointed at the cinema this time!",Rebecca

137,sebastianschlicht,Uninspired wannabe thriller!,2,2 November 2020,"It's always exciting to see a remake of a story without knowing the original. ""Rebecca"" is based on the novel of the same name by Daphne Du Maurier, which was implemented very successfully in 1940 by Grand Master Alfred Hitchcock. The remake of the material was released under the direction of Ben Wheatley and celebrated its premiere in 2020 on ""netflix"". It should be clear to everyone that a Wheatley is not a Hitchcock. Still, I was very disappointed with the end result.A young woman in Monte Carlo falls in love with the handsome widower Maxim de Winter. He wants to marry her pretty quickly and takes her to his estate in Manderley on the English coast. But Maxim's late ex-wife still seems to play a major role there. He doesn't want to talk about it, but the staff keep talking about her: Rebecca. The young Mrs. De Winter quickly realizes that she is not welcome here...I can't give much praise, but at least the two main actors do their job properly, even if they rarely have the chance to show what theyÃÂ´re capable of. The landscape shots are also good and very impressive here and there. But what is missing is a good script and charm.""Rebecca"" from 2020 is such a typical, lengthy wannabe thriller that rarely creates real tension and also fails in the romantic part. Unfortunately, Hammer and James have little chemistry. The only romantic moments are coming from the pretty places they travel to. The characters all talk to each other in fake ""film language"" and often explaining things only to the viewer, not Lily James' character. And it is she who should know about the late ex-wife. But neither her husband nor anyone else gives her clear information. I get it: They want to make it seem mysterious and exciting, but itÃÂ´s just frustrating to watch. It requieres a very talented director to do something like that. Or a good script.
So it's no wonder that she keeps getting into a series of embarrissing situations so that the forced drama can take its course. But that is not a natural structure!In addition, there are cheap scares that are supposed to justify the thriller genre, but none of it was creepy or exciting. Especially not if you don't care about the characters or you can't understand their actions (for example, how can Lily James endure Armie Hammer for so long, if he closes himself off to her?).Clint Mansell's music didn't really convince me either. Nicely composed, but used far too inflationary.Conclusion: ""Rebecca"" is a boring and uninspired wannabe thriller that I don't like even without having seen the original. If anything, it sparked my interest in the Hitchcock film, but unfortunately I can't get much more positive out of it.",Rebecca

Lily James is a youthful heroine, and I dare say she tends to attract the viewers favourably.
By far, Kristin Scott-Thomas is the most striking presence here, but the entourage of second characters is quite good, servants, villagers, policemen, etc.

142,Amonute-Matoaka,Vapid and unfortunately -given the material and the cast- disappointing,4,8 December 2020,"Du Maurier would laugh in the face of whatever poor soul decided Rebecca needed a Hollywood makeover.This is a story of faulty people committing a long series of mistakes (and crimes) and yet instead of us the audience being filled with dread, we are made to react with apathy to whatever ill befalls them. I'd even go as far as to say that the most sympathetic figure was, in fact, the one that was created to be the embodiment of a scary, haughty, gothic character: Mrs Danvers. Which really makes me question the creative decisions made here that allowed me to get to such a conclusion.One thing that makes Rebecca (the novel, and the character) so tantalizing is that it's always right on the verge of the supernatural. We're given plenty of hints to let our imaginations run wild, but are never told about any actual explicit ghostly happenings.This film reduces the atmosphere of the book and the mystery surrounding Rebecca by simply portraying her as a promiscuous woman who finds out she has terminal cancer and instead of suffering to the bitter end she commits suicide by cop with the ""help"" of her enraged husband.Said husband hides his crime, evades the law and is allowed to roam free, even though he is, in fact, a murderer.Wrap this up with a make-shift happy ending that was never meant to be, given the story, and what are we, as an audience, left with?

I didn't care for any of the characters. They didn't feel anything like those from the book.

I read the novel some years ago. And watched the film from Hitchcock, and I liked it. But I just saw it again some days ago, and oh lord, it wasn't as good as I remembered.
Let's be clear: it's a story about an invisible woman, with no charm, and her very toxic relationship with her husband and Mrs Danvers. Maxim is an archetype of toxic masculinity. She is what women must be: almost nothing.
I think those figures are very well drawn in this film.
So, why all that hate? Because everything is better in our memories. I tried to see both side by side, and I liked the two of them. Maybe a bit more the new one, because all the costumes, and I guess that the character of Maxim is better performed by Arnie Hammer, that is, more real, down to earth.

Even though the visual aspect of the film was beautiful, nothing else In this film was believable! The acting was terrible, the characters completely ludicrous, the writing excruciatingly bad & the overall delivery of the film failed on all levels! I've never written a review like this before. But then, I've never seen a movie like this before! The trailer had me intrigued & was done well, and the beginning of the film seemed promising! But as I got into the film, it just became weird. I have no idea what happened to this film. It just kept getting worse! It was like watching a train wreck!",Rebecca
159,montymonvieux,Dismal Failure,3,23 October 2020,"Why, oh why are great masterpieces remade? This one is a dismal failure!After having read the wonderful novel and viewed Hitchcock's extraordinary film version repeatedly, (it remains one of my top ten favorite films) I must dismiss this this as a dismal failure.Some observations and impressions: Many lines are delivered in a strange manner, throwing off the meaning they should convey. Mrs Van Hopper is played as a gross, cliched caricature of the nouveau riche American visiting ""The Continent."" Lily James's awkward, loud performance lacks Joan Fontaine's lovely shy, reticence and femininity as the second Mrs. deWinter. Her hairstyle and wardrobe are inaccurate for the time period and she's rather unkempt looking for a time period where every hair was expected to be in place; lipstick and jewelry always worn. If she had been shown in a pair of trousers once, I would accept it, but wearing them repeatedly-and bell bottoms?
Nope! And wrong era!Armie Hammer is quite handsome, but he's no Maxim de Winter! His performance lacks the somber, dignity and self-possessed aura of privilege necessary to appear as an aristocratic gentleman. Kristin Scott Thomas's delivery of lines is plainly awkward, yet Keeley Hawes plays Beatrice Lacey well, as she excels in the society lady role.I miss the heavy air of romantic melancholia in Hitchcock's Manderley (and he achieved that on a limited Hollywood sound stage). This version is like a terrible TV movie. Sadly, the new ""Rebecca"" is beyond disappointing and I do not recommend it.",Rebecca
160,Digital_excitation,"30's costume drama at its best, stunning scenery",8,9 November 2020,"It became clear very soon that this movie was a mix of 50's cinema style storytelling and typical top notch English costume drama. As a fan of the latter, I tend not only to watch the story unfold, but also the details and scenery. Both are exquisite, both cars, houses, roads, persons and their costumes and customs, outside and inside of stunning buildings, completely genuine to that era in Europe and England. It is somewhat of a classic fairy-tale Cinderella story with the evil stepmother (Mrs. Danvers) included, carefully woven into a typical love-crime-drama that we used to see in American cinema. All of the players are at their best and in this slow paced, predictable, somewhat stereotype movie.A definite must-see for fans of the genre and people interested in that era, but probably a lot less interesting for the average Hollywood-type movie viewer.",Rebecca

162,jaeelbooks,Daphne du Maurier would be Proud,9,2 November 2020,"Let me begin by saying that 'Rebecca' is one of my favorite novels of all time, and Hitchcock's classic rendition is one of my favorite films. When I saw that Netflix had revamped it into a brand new movie, I wasn't sure what to think. Netflix has a habit of rushing their pictures and focusing more on set design and special effects than scripting and plot. However, I buckled down to watch it, and let me say, I was quite pleased and incredibly impressed.For those who don't know the story, 'Rebecca' is about a young servant to a wealthy and eccentric old woman who happens to be in the right place at the right time to find love and excitement with a wealthy and recently widowed playboy. The servant in this feature is played by the lovely and talented Lily James, and the playboy is well-cast as Armie Hammer.When the two meet and their relationship builds, there comes a bit of jealousy from the eccentric old woman, played by the always stunning Ann Dowd. With a threat to pull the servant away and take her across the world, as far away from the playboy as possible, Maxim de Winter proposes and steals the servant away, marrying her and moving her into his enormous and elegant manor.There is one problem with this - the staff of Manderley was overly fond of Rebecca, de Winter's first wife, and they do not take to Lily James all that well. In fact, the head of the house Mrs. Danvers (played by the remarkable Kristin Scott Thomas) detests the new wife's presence so much that she begins to sabotage her stay in the house.Tensions arise and dark secrets begin to surface, causing turmoil between the new bride and her loving but distant husband. The film, in true du Maurier fashion, seamlessly begins to transform from a classic romance into a nail-biting mystery.Netflix and director Ben Wheatley took their time with this story, staying as true to the novel as possible while still paying appropriate homage to Hitchcock's film - and still making it very much their own. I recommend this movie to those who love a good romance, a good thriller, and a fantastic story. And remember - if you like the movie, you'll love the book.",Rebecca

I do admit that the original has much better storyline and dialogues between characters, and is much more believable BUT this movie is definitely more romantic.People also say don't make remake if you don't have anything new to add to it. I disagree. Why? Because new generations are (sadly) not likely to watch an old black and white movie, it just doesn't engage them enough.
This movie has something that will certainly attract younger audience especially because of the romance we see between the main characters.The story is great and has tension until the very end.

182,d.e.katz,A disappointing adaptation,6,21 October 2020,"This adaptation of Daphne DuMaurier's magnificent novel cannot hold a candle to Alfred Hitchcock's 1938 adaptation starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine, nor is it comparable to the terrific 1997 BBC mini-series starring Charles Dance and Emilia Fox.As was his wont, Hitchcock added his own touch to his version of the book, similar to what he did in his other adaptations. For example, in both Rebecca and Suspicion, he changed the ending of the story or altered the presentation due to such considerations as audiences unwilling to accept stars like Laurence Olivier and Cary Grant being guilty of murder. The 1997 BBC adaptation was much truer to the original novel and was brilliantly presented.With respect to this 2020 Netflix entry, they should have left it in the can. Armie Hammer is unconvincing as a British aristocrat; he is neither Olivier nor Dance. Lily James suffers from poor direction and she hasn't anywhere near the acting chops of Joan Fontaine or Emilia Fox. Kristin Scott Thomas is a worthy successor to Dame Judith Anderson, offering an excellent portrayal of the wicked Mrs. Danvers, but even that cannot save this film from mediocrity. (Truth be told, the Mrs. Danvers character is the juiciest in the story.)The worst part of the movie is how the writers have altered the denoument completely, weakening both its punch and surprise. One of the principal supporting characters, Jack Favell (portrayed by Sam Riley), is reduced to a simpering boor; his role has become almost an afterthought rather than the key on which the story turns. George Sanders and Jonathan Cake each gave masterful renditions of Favell's venality in the 1940 and 1997 versions, respectively.It is a shame that the original material has been so badly diluted.",Rebecca

185,mikemikeparker,Direction without direction,2,21 October 2020,"This was a travesty of a film. Compared to either the novel or Hitchcock's masterpiece this is crass and cliched, with unsubtle and implausible characterisation. The girl (never named ) was over-played by Lily James; rather than a woman driven to the edge of nervous breakdown, here she appeared on the edge of madness at times. Max was written and played by Hammer as weak and rather petulant - none of the imperiousness of his class. Add to this predictable dream sequences, an unnecessary near-car crash and an absolutely appalling last sequence which changes the whole tone of the book, turning the protagonists into abject failures, and you have a disaster. All of these faults have to be laid at the feet of poor writing and poor direction. A lavish production, wasted.Only Kirsten Scott Thomas was excellent and worth the two stars on her own.",Rebecca

Kristin Scott Thomas delivers a stand out performance as the wicked head housekeeper and Lily James is equally appealing as Mrs de Winter. The film is shot in England at the beautiful Cranborne Manor and Hatfield House and is a wonderful psychological thriller with twists and turns right up until the end.

The camera, shockingly, does not love the lead actors. James plays a date of some experience, not a star-struck innocent. Their romantic beach scenes played to today's audience, not the reality of 1935. Hammer, appallingly dressed in a wrinkled, ugly brown suit in 1935 Monte Carlo, lacks the needed imperious nature of an English titled gentleman. Scott Thomas lacks menace. The story has been considerably changed either out of ignorance or to fit the time constraints. This movie either suffers from misdirection or poor cinematography. Or both. I would highly recommend the 1998 version of Rebecca starring Charles Dance and Emilia Fox if you want to see the best, magical version.",Rebecca
194,ericobnn,Better than the 1940 classic,8,29 October 2020,"I watched this without knowing anything about Rebecca or even that it was a book, and I quite enjoyed it. It is generally well acted and has good suspense. Then reading the reviews here where so many people bash this for ""having no reason to exist"" given that there is a 1940 version from Hitchcock which is apparently perfect, I went ahead and watched that one for comparison. I must go against the grain here and say that the Hitchcock version is significantly worse (gasp!).For instance, the performance of the actor who plays Maxim in the 2020 version was nothing to write home about, but 1940's Maxim is so badly acted it's almost comical (in contrast to many good actors in that film such as the new Mrs. de Winter, Ms. Danvers and Favell). Furthermore, the music simply does not match the scenes at all (happy, cookie-cutter, bland music permeates the entire movie, playing even during suspenseful scenes, creating a massive mismatch between the moods conveyed by you're seeing and what you're hearing). The new version did a much better job of handling psychological tension and suspense.In short, I really have no clue why so many people are bashing this remake and saying that the 1940 is better, other than ""OMG IT'S HITCHCOCK SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY A MASTERPIECE, AND IF YOU DISAGREE YOU ARE AN UNCULTURED LOUT"".

The script is dreadful and might be largely responsible for some ham fisted melodramatic acting. It's as full of holes and as wooden as the scuttled boat that consigned Rebecca herself. It's a pity they didn't put the script on it with it.

198,nnmbrookes,Exquisitely beautiful with heart of darkness just as Du Maurier defined Rebecca,9,24 October 2020,"The non human characters in this film elevates it above the ordinary. Mandelay is
Exquisitely beautiful with heart of darkness just as Du Maurier defined Rebecca. Gothic but not horrific.
How beautiful was the bedroom in the west wing. Clever to have Rebecca leave her boudoir via a mini corridor in mirrors. There are so many small gems to spy in this sumptuous gem of a film. Such as Mrs Danvers' toy playing with a bird artificially trapped in a cage. Maxims name in Mrs De winters' sun tanned back The sprites and sea nymphs that burst from the Cornish waves beckoning, luring Mrs Danvers. The fire in Maxims eyes. From the narrow Cornish streets and fish market to the astounding Monte Carlo in summer sun. A cinematographic excellence.
Higher still in the accomplishment league comes the actors' performances : The grotesque Mrs Van Hopper, Jane Lapotaires dementia of granny and the desperation of those around her. Armie Hammers delightful happiness as he falls in love with the next Mrs De winter. Counterpoint to the rage in his expression at Favell. Deftly avoiding melodrama. Lily James' character was a triumph of modern adaptation. The contradiction of Joan Fontains' version (which was wonderful in its day) of a timid little innocent becoming the rock that Maxim depended on. Turned into a strength from the start albeit unworldly, evolving into the tour de force, defying the onlooker to interfere in her final over his shoulder glare. Wonderful! But the highlight of the performance has to be when she is released from the torment by Maxims confession that he hated Rebecca. The pain leaving her face is palpable. Trying to find out who is the second Mrs De Winter by first name it becomes clear that Du Maurier never intended for there to be the possibility of comparison. Rebecca was a centre of self obsession, Mrs De Winter the second was wife and soulmate to Maxim.
If difficult to follow Olivier and Fontain, imagine being compared to Judith Andersons Danvers! But Kristen Scott Thomas made it her own. A deliciously modern interpretation that explained the twisted descent into hopelessness and grief. Rather than the psychopathic. Much less posturing and blank staring. Allowing the character to smile and be helpful echoes modern smiling vipers !! Not exactly preferable since the original is undeniably great........just different and a cinematic joy.

212,Miroslav-A,Modern vs. Original version ?,8,9 July 2021,"Who cares about Rebecca next to Lily alive ! 'You don't look like any other...' says one song. It's guaranteed Armie thought the same thing when he saw her 😉.Joking aside, we've got an 80 year newer version than Hitchcock's. His movie took two Oscars, this one didn't pick up any of the prizes. She had one BAFTA nomination, and the women's society gave nomination for a 'remake that shouldn't have been recorded'. Are you kidding me...So, chronologically : First I looked at the modern version (it was just fine, I'm not going to say I was thrilled). Then I read a bunch of negative comments, mostly on the subject of a bad remake, etc. After that, it made sense to look at the title from 1940.I sincerely wanted to be pleasantly surprised, so that I can also put the classic (which I don't normally watch) in front of the modern version with very dear actors to me. But that just didn't happen. The dialogues are more subtle, and the costumes are more visually striking in the color version.After all, how could ever be a better looking guy that dude in a black-and-white combination in comparison to Armie who walks around in an Oker suit. Also, the hostile attitude towards the new Mrs. De Winter has been played much more intensely by K. S. Thomas in the role of Mrs. Danvers.With all due respect to fans of black-and-white movies and older cinema, these two titles are simply incomparable. Their only touchpoint is the script, since they were made by the same book.After a visually less attractive older title, I looked again at the color version, this time with pleasure. Because now I've looked at it side by side, and the details in the scenes that I didn't pay attention to at first look, now were much more noticeable.L. James interprets the role of a lower-social girl whose charm could not be resisted by the wealthy Mr. De Winter (similar to 'Cinderella' in which we also had the chance to see her).After a brief romance, he takes her to his lavish estate as a wife, where a romantic fairy tale slowly loses its intensity and moves into drama/mystery...The aforementioned Rebecca is actually the late Mrs. De Winter whose 'ghost' is still present in the house. At the very mention of her name, there is sense of authority she had for her employees. Its chambers are still a 'sacred place' where nobody goes...New Mrs. De Winter now has a difficult 'task' of taking her place that is not yet 'vacated', as well as uncovering the mystery behind Rebecca's death.For more movie reviews, visit my blog :

213,Martianette,"Wheatley toying with realism, again",8,12 January 2021,"I adore the novel, and I enjoyed the Hitchcock adaptation, but have always loved Wheatley's films (my absolute favourite is 'A Field in England' - just astoundingly clever and mad). So, while this version of 'Rebecca' isn't as psychologically extreme as 'High-Rise' or 'A Field in England', it's not far off. But that's what Wheatley does, so very well - he anchors everything in realism, and when that foundational starting point is teamed with du Maurier's source material, the result is thrilling, compelling, and gorgeously ambiguous. Your allegiances will change, as they do in Wheatley's other films, and as they might in real life. Character who may have remained literary or filmic tropes and stereotypes will flesh out in this version, into empathetic, understandable humans. I wish I could say more, but I won't - just watch it!Wheatley's take is original - he guides the source material into a non-hysterical, far-from-clichéd adaptation. Wonderful shades of Austen's 'Northanger Abbey', ala Catherine Morland and Henry Tilney, realising what is real and what is imagined, and how to act. My only criticism is that the last movement was too fast for me - a whirlwind of loose ends tidied up - but then again, the focus had to dwell on Mrs de Winter's experiences and related character growth (sorry about being abstract - am dodging spoilers here!).I'm looking forward to repeat viewings of this version, if not always for the puzzle unfolding before me, then for the ingenious shot choices and cinematography, let alone perfect casting.",Rebecca

I thought they could have played in the gothic genre more and allowed for the ghost of 'Rebecca' to come to the forefront.

It seems like people are comparing this to the original adaptation so maybe that's why? But as someone who has only read the book I thought this adaptation was great honestly, and it's rare I read a book and then enjoy the film!

However, it was interesting enough to watch so I could compare and contrast the two versions. I am not a great fan of Lily James' acting but she and Hammer were ok. Kristin Scott Thomas (predictably) is head and shoulders above the rest of the cast, but her storyline had changed somewhat and had lost a lot of the impact from the 1940 version. There were some odd moments such as the complete dissonance between the scenes of 1950s England playing against what seems to be modern Celtic folk music. On the whole, I'd say that it's a reasonably entertaining film if you have some spare time, but if you haven't seen the original and only plan to watch one, you should definitely watch that instead.",Rebecca

It is so lame of a remake, all it can do is try not to embarrass itself too badly as it did with that horrendous yellow suit. The acting is subpar, the few changes just takes away from the story, the costumes made you cringe at times, there was no mystery, no suspense, no foreboding atmosphere, no thrill and not even the Danvers character could add anything redeeming to this. There was nothing in this version that made the original such a timeless classic. At least in others adaptions, there was something of worth, even if it could not live up to its predecessor.

I was excited initially to see it on Netflix, then saw the photo of Lily James with lipstick etc and my hopes dropped a little.This character is so 'little', that's why her actual name is never mentioned, even in the book.

226,StewPink,"Rebecca is ultimately a tale of somebody never able to live up to a predecessor. Funnily enough, this film didn't come close.",2,25 January 2021,"Every now and then somebody decides to recreate a classic and there's no denying Daphne Du Maurier's Rebecca is just that. If you only read one chapter in one book then the first chapter of Rebecca should be it, Du Maurier is the undisputed champion of powerful imagery through descriptive writing and this is a prime example. If you've never read the book or you're unfamiliar with her works then you're sorely missing out. You're also unlikely to have a go at turning it into a film but I'd hazard a guess this may well be the case for Ben Wheatley's remake.The film begins with a nod to the book as Lily James narrates the opening few lines. As with many stories, the beginning of Rebecca is incredibly important as it should create a telling forecast of what is to come, leaving us with a sense of excitement and intrigue over what circumstances led our character here. Du Maurier took us on a beautifully captivating journey through her dream and to recreate that, all that needed to be done here was to read what the majority of the audience already know word by word. Instead, as is the case for the whole of this film, the scene is so incredibly brief that we barely even notice it has begun before we're transported to the next bright and sunny moment.The story of Rebecca is a dark one. We follow a plain and shy woman living in the shadow of her rude and aloof husband's late wife, Rebecca. This movie fails to achieve any of this. Instead, it's bright and colourful where it should be dark and moody. Armie Hammer's Maxim de Winter is a stylish and attentive lover where he should be blunt, distant and proper. His early scenes paint his character in such a way that it seems hilarious when he does later try to assert some authority in the role. Less like a man of authority and more like Basil Faulty in charge of Downton Abbey. Lily James' new Mrs de Winter should be a character intimidated by shadows; Rebecca's and her own. In this she's curious, daring and at one point even goes so far as to fire Kristen Scott Thomas' Mrs Danvers! (I would too; she should be grim, strict and terrifying but with this portrayal of the character in charge at Manderley it's no wonder everything's such a mess.)Believe it or not, those are just the little things. In 1940, Alfred Hitchcock's screen adaptation of Rebecca was a success. Why? Because Hitchcock's mastery of creating suspense perfectly matched Du Maurrier's intentions in the book. Of course, filmed in 1940, it's a little dated to say the least and watching it now seems as if the cast were paid a bonus for speaking the dialogue as quickly as possible. But, given all the might of modern cinema this latest reincarnation of Rebecca is the exact opposite, seemingly racing through every moment, completely missing any opportunity to create suspense in order to get to the next piece of dialogue as quickly as possible.If you can bring yourself to watch the entire movie I suspect you'll be baffled by much of it because it completely fails to make you feel the emotions you need to understand the twists in the story. The ending differs quite a lot from the book and from Hitchcock's version too but make no mistake, originality doesn't improve it. Reading the book, you need no explanation because you absorb the beginning, engage with the middle and love the ending. Hitchcock's ending, to give it a fairer comparison, is perhaps a little fast but much simpler. This, Wheatley's version, if you'll pardon the pun, is completely lost at sea.Ironic really, that Rebecca is ultimately a tale of somebody never able to live up to a predecessor. Funnily enough, this film didn't come close.",Rebecca

I decided to compare all of them to see what is Hitchcock's style actually is.I expected that I'd dislike the 2020 version but I kind liked it more than 1940 version. The new one is visually pleasing and interesting and doesn't feel bland like the old one.The production and costume design itself is great than the old version.

231,jasanderson9090,Unfair to compare but it doesn't live up to the name.,4,21 October 2020,"It is hard to remake a masterpiece. Laurence Olivier as Maxim, Joan Fontaine as Mrs. De Winter and Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers with Alfred Hitchcock directing - delivered a triumph of two Oscars and nine nominations. This should have signaled to everyone concerned that any rendition will fall short. Unfortunately Netflix gambled wrong on this one, however, Lily James is a joy to watch as Mrs. De Winter and manages to make the otherwise lackluster movie interesting. Director Ben Wheatley brings us a cleaner more rational version of the novel, while Armie Hammer misses on the depth that the 1940 version cast in his place, Laurence Olivier. To compare Hammer to one of the best actors of all time is quite unfair, however Hammer's performance doesn't give the character of Maxim a chance to breathe in the nuances needed.
The same goes for Kristin Scott Thomas' performance of Mrs. Danvers, although its hard to live up to one of the most iconic performances (by Judith Anderson) in cinematic history.",Rebecca

I didn't read the novel, but I was personally really disappointed. So many questions placed but not answered. If Max hated Rebekka so much, why to keep everything just to remember her? Why to still have Mrs.Danvers around? Why he is sleepwalking into their former bedroom? Whose body was the body Max indentified for the first time? What about that freak in the cottage?

I never expect a movie to be exactly like the book--- I don't think it's possible most of the time---I just want the move to capture the spirit and essence of the book.I really the first 90 minutes or so of the movie, and then, CLUNK. The climax and denouement inexplicably veered from the spirit and essence of the novel. The weird party/dream scenes, the graphics of a dead body---both in and out of the water---, and the biggest unforced error during the scene when Maxim loads a gun and goads his wife to shoot him. In the novel, their love is cemented in that scene of confession, and it is super important to believe that they have re-discovered each other, which is not communicated in this movie. Also, the scene where she sneaks into the doctor's office, and in general, the way that they wove Favell into the plot, were enormous fails.It's not a bad way to spend two hours.

239,anneclairedrocourt,Mixed review,7,24 October 2020,"Having read the novel, but not watched the Hitchcock adaptation, I came to watch this adaptation with quite an open mind, hoping only to find the suspense key to the book.
Although, there were some tense and intense moments throughout the film, I was unable to be captivated by the movie, for the romantic/calm moments were done in a way that it became easy to not pay attention to them.
On a positive note, Kristin Scott Thomas was absolutely mesmerizing in her role as Mrs Danvers, and Armie Hammer was very good as well (although perhaps unfortunately directed to act too vulnerable at times for the character). I was a bit disappointed by Lily James's performance, because although she had a few good moments, I found at times her movements and expressions to be too exaggerated, often to the point of grotesque. I thought the secondary actors were very well casted.
The score was a great contribution to the movie in my opinion!
The cinematography was mostly good, with great use of colors at times, unfortunately there were times where it was a bit dull.
I also felt the ending was rushed and fragmented, with the last minutes of the movie being quite disappointing.",Rebecca

242,abigailjackson-55395,Overall a worthwhile watch !,7,25 October 2020,"First of all, the aesthetics of this movie were absolutely gorgeous which allowed the movie to remain, in the very least, visually intriguing and engaging. I have to admit that I've never read the book or watched the older version of the movie, but I enjoyed Lily James' and Armie Hammer's character performances. They weren't outstanding, but they were convincing and entertaining and visually appealing as a couple. You could really feel for Lily James' character throughout the story which added a needed emotional aspect that was quite effective. The movie did a good job of making you feel as though you were personally witnessing the events of the plot, giving it the feel of an intimate peek inside the secret lives of the characters. One of my only complaints about the movie is that I feel like they could have built up some of the more important scenes. A few of the turning points in the plot could have been made a bit more cathartic in order to make it more of a drama. I still found these turning points satisfying, but I feel as though they could have been presented more dramatically. I also wasn't a huge fan of the ending. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly powerful either. I'm not sure how fans of the source material feel about the movie, but I found it thoroughly enjoyable. Even if you are a huge stickler for the source material, it is a worthwhile watch at least for the splendid visuals, cinematography, and entertaining performances. I am likely to rewatch this film on a rainy day.",Rebecca

246,itamarmar,"Not Hitchcock and not apologetic about it. A whole different, much more gripping and thorough interpretation to the base material",10,18 December 2020,"Absolutely amazing. Haven't seen a movie like that in a long time. A real movie. It was so full of life. From the aesthetics, to the tone of writing that was so stylish, to the overall sense of directing and the feeling of a unique world condensed into a screen
From the design of the opening credits, the opening monologue(loved Lily's accent btw). And then a line of great actresses began. Lily that starts as that awkward girl, goes through being terrorized and to the end when she really develops as a person. The first one that caught my eye was the eccentric character played by Ann Dowd. She was addictive and so much fun and intense, plus she had amazing overall aesthetic.
Then you have some gorgeous but very subtle/short romantic intimate scenes. As much as subtle/short as they were, they really left a feeling, and helped keep in mind and believe what the two characters felt about each other and how that really fueled their motives. Jane lapotaire(a favorite of mine from the crown) had one scene, sort of a cameo, but was amazing and so added to the building sense of psychological thriller that's going on. Kristin Scott Thomas started to show small nuances of her complex character, unique traits of how she presents herself etc, and was so impressive and fun as the movie kept going. Always fond of the psycho-biddies, but Kristin really gave her depth and made her emotions so human and bold. on top of that the wonderful Lesley hawes who played such a lovable good hearted character you could not help but really fall for her.
As the movie proceeded the tension grew, but in peaks, which was very interesting, really felt it at some points(reminded me of Darren aronofsky's mother! For few scenes).
I just loved how Rebecca and her role was interpreted and used so differently from the Hitchcock's version. Taken much more to depth and played with! Explored! What it did to mrs de winter. The the name Rebecca appeared on everything and haunted the viewers as sort of a replacement to the usual monsters who follow and chase the victim. The suspense was amazing, especially towards the end.
I feel like this is a story with so much to it. And this movie really dived in.
A filmmaker I'm so excited to follow as he starts his journey. Absolutely a talent that made a strong piece. Some of you might've not liked it. But I know in the future if he gets a material that's more to your liking, he'll know what to do with it.
Perfect length, did not at all get me bored like the Hitchcock one did! Was absolutely gripping till the last second actually. And just the transformation of lily was so beautiful and smart, crafted carefully and believably.
I will say one thing I disliked- the CGI'd scenes that were unnecessary, not very well done, and undermined the general aesthetic and at atmosphere. But that is so small in comparison to how amazing it is all together.
So I'll just say I enjoyed it so much and will watch again in the future.",Rebecca

Armie Hammer has the intensity of a carrot, he's too vanilla for the role. His suits are horrible, badly tailored, the mustard suit in the beginning is an eye sore. Kristin Scott Thomas as Mrs Danvers is the only saving grace of this movie. And finally, the cinematography is bad.

The events including significant revelations were RUSHED so much that there was no build up to them nor enough time to let them sink in before moving on to the next scene. The reactions to some news or events within the plot were dull & lacked sincerity and passion.The editing for those scenes didn't help either.

The emotional connection I wanted to feel for the characters kept being interrupted.Though I still kept an open mind and was hoping I'll be pleasantly surprised that I'll love this movie by the end of it, but unfortunately, it just kept going the same kind of direction till the movie was over.I've been looking forward to this, and even with my expectations being reasonable and not too high, I still didn't get what I wanted.And just to be clear, I'm not comparing this to Hitchcock's version. In fact, I've never even seen it. So this is solely based on the execution of the story in this specific movie. It simply didn't do it for me.",Rebecca
260,rodrveronica,At least Lily James doesn't disappoint ...,3,3 November 2020,"How does one successfully remake a Hitchcock film? Well, this version of Rebecca is not going to bring any answers. Lily James plays Mrs. De Winter, a former lady's campanion and new bride to the dashing Armie Hammer character Maxim de Winter. Except if you have seen Olivier in the role, then Hammer's de Winter is not dashing nor mysterious, just lacking.
Ben Wheatley takes the director reigns and doesn't follow in Hitchcock's footsteps for a successful movie. Kristen Scott Thomas is a good actor but she also fails to compare as Mrs. Danvers to the Oscar performance Judith Anderson brought in the original. Hard to compete with the Best Picture Winner of 1941 and the 2020 version isn't anywhere close.",Rebecca

The background music is very weak and doesn't fit the moodiness and mystery of the story. Modern music interspersed breaks the magic of being transported back to the 1940s, the time the characters inhabit.Lily James is a stand out with her natural charm as she eases into the role of Mrs. de Winter, the shy but strong heroine. Surprisingly Arnie Hammer carries off the role of the brooding lord of the manner. Kristen Scott Thomas is even more sinister in the role of Mrs. Danvers.If they would totally redo the soundtrack score, this version would be a 10",Rebecca

I've read the book many times again after and read its prequel 'Rebecca's Tale' too.Needless to say that I was equally as excited as I was apprehensive at this version. But I felt disappointed by the end at the whole movie.The cinematography is very beautiful but the story just isn't quite there.Although not every film version of a book has to stay true to the story this film version could've greatly benefited from not deviating so much and making such unnecessary changes.I love Armie Hammer as an actor but I would've preferred an English actor to portray Maxim de Winter.Lily James also did not feel right in her role. Even if her physical appearance fits the role her acting was irritating and unnatural at times. I didn't feel like she was right as Mrs. de Winter and I do feel like she's a little too overrated as an actress. I'm sick of seeing her in films just for the sake of it.
I personally would've preferred to see Carey Mulligan in the role.On another note I actually think that Kristin Scott Thomas was a splendid choice. It's just a shame that she played Mrs. Danvers in a not so great version.",Rebecca

I know it's not fair to compare the movie with the book, but I can not help it. It should have been a series than a two hours movie. There was so much more to this than was presented.",Rebecca

Lily James just about held the film together largely because of her beauty and her costumes. But the film lacked substance and felt lightweight. The actors interpreted their lines but forgot to engage emotion. They came across as unlikeable and unbelievable. Armie Hammer was wooden, charmless and not a bit mysterious and Kristin Scott Thomas played her usual icey role which we have all seen her do many many times. If the pace had been faster and they edited out a good half hour, it might have earned an extra star.",Rebecca

Sadly, I was disappointed, starting with the casting of Maxim DeWinter and Mrs. DeWinter. The role of Maxim--urbane and brooding--begged for a Ralph Fiennes. And the young woman playing Mrs. DeWinter brought to mind a cheerleader from, perhaps, Cleveland, when it needed Saoirse Ronan. It lacked the feel and appearance of the classic Gothic original.

I knew that, imo, Max was portrayed as far too young and Lily James is far too pretty to play Mrs de Winter no.2., but Kristin Scott-Thomas as Mrs Danvers spurred me on and I wasn't disappointed, consummate professional that she is. However, my 2 stars are for her and the sumptuousness of the locations. And that's it.
The story is supposed to be full of suspense that has you wondering what's going on. How will the new Mrs de W cope, thrust into the life of the elite when she hasn't got a clue? Let alone being made to feel inadequate by the ghost of the first Mrs de W still pervading every corner of Manderley and the heartbreaking realisation that your husband still grieves for her. She can't hope to escape Rebecca's presence and this hangs over everything like a pall, even affecting you new marriage.
The whirlwind romance was supposed to lead you into the real meat of the story, but then it was badly rushed. Was everybody as fed up as we were and wanted to go home?? Where was the build up? Mrs Danvers nearly succeeding in driving Mrs de W to suicide was over in 2 seconds and the final, amazing revelation that stuns the wife as well as the audience was thrown away!
Oh please, in the future at least get a director who has read and understands the book. I'm afraid Hitchcock, even with the 'Hollywood' ending, is still the king....",Rebecca
276,itchy-8,Du Maurier fans: consider it a comedy,8,12 July 2021,"This is a very expensive and stylish adaptation, a real treat for the eyes. But as a big du Maurier fan, I was angered the first time I saw it. It improves on subsequent viewings.As usual, they cast a beautiful blonde as the nameless heroine. We could live with that, but she is loaded with agency. She demands unconventional breakfasts of the waiters in Monte Carlo, she has an anachronistically revealing bathing suit, she even tells Mrs. Danvers to scram. Twice.They do it, or something that looks awfully like it, before they are married. Mrs. Van Hopper finds out about their romance from gossips. Mrs. Danvers calls Rebecca-and Frank Crawley-by their first names. Maxim writes Jack Favell a check for 10,000 pounds, and Favell decides not to cash it, but to turn it over to the proper authorities. Perhaps funniest of all, when the heroine realizes the importance of Dr. Baker, she jumps in the car by herself, drives hundreds of miles to London, uses subterfuge to get into Dr. Baker's office, and steals Rebecca's medical record. Get the picture? Enjoy the scenery, be glad that a new generation has been introduced to du Maurier, and don't become too angry at the weirdness.",Rebecca

I've never read the book nor seen any similar adaptation of this and honestly I loved it. I sat down expecting an Agatha Christie like movie experience and I got it. How I thought the movie was going was nowhere near where it went. I enjoyed the characters, loving and hating them which is a display of the tremendous acting in this film. Visually it is a dark beautifully done movie with a great plot. Made me desperately want a trip to Europe and to spend the weekend watching other period themed movies and shows.

Tasteless doesn't begin to describe it.After all the class of her character throughout the movie, the scene at the end is nothing more than the director's attempt to associate 'love' with the empty and insecure sexual relationships of this age of neo-Marxism and of which Netflix is a key contributor.Once again, another historical fiction ruined by the tasteless Netflix generation of politically slanted producers.",Rebecca

290,mcnab-54953,WHY THE CHANGES?,3,22 October 2020,"Daphne du Maurier's novel Rebecca is a masterpiece. David O. Selznick knew that when people came to see his version directed by Alfred Hitchcock, they would want to see the book. He did the same with Gone With the Wind. Even Hitchcock wanted to change some things but Selznick stuck to his guns and the movie was a huge success and won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1940. So 80 years later, this remake comes to the screen. It started out okay. quoting the classic first line of the book, ""Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again."" I decided I would not compare it to the Hitchcock movie but rather the novel on which it is based. They stayed fairly true to the book with occasional weird moments added in. Then it all fell apart. I won't spoil anything, but where there was so much suspense in the book, here it became rather bland and unemotional. The ending was completely changed and the last scene was total sleaze. I assume it was meant to be politically correct but are you kidding me? Anyway, thought Lily James did well in the role until her 'transformation"" but that was more the directors fault than hers. Mr. Hammer is wooden and dull. Maxim de Winter is not a very likeable character in the book but he is played here like a Casper Milktoast. Ms. Scott-Thomas does well as Mrs. Danvers. Overall, could have been so much better. I agree with Mr. Selznick. People want to see the book.",Rebecca

You can't take a story like this serious, or acting so over-the-top when you film it in UHD color that makes everything feel so modern, it just makes the old-fashion story seem so much more out of date.
It never stops being predictable, never interesting and worst - it keeps going after it stops.
After the big reveal is revealed, the film still has 20 mins of horrible court case that drags the running time. If it wasn't for the 'stop' option on Netflix, I would say the film forces you to stay with too much. Thankfully, that is not needed

It is a book adaptation, which is what I think people tend to forget. I have read the book and seen the earlier film version and I think others are being a bit overdramatic with comparisons. It is fine to prefer the Hitchcock version but I think this movie did a good job. It was enjoyable, acted well, and beautifully shot. I was expecting this to be a fun, light hearted romance based off other's comments and was pleasantly surprised. It did have a Great Gatsby feel at first when they were in Monte Carlo but that quickly changes once they get to Manderley and the difference is stark. The psychological aspect was definitely there and I found myself very anxious watching the narrator deal with the 'ghost' of Rebecca. Lily James did well portraying the main character as insecure and paranoid, and much of it was communicated through her body language. I felt her emotions right along with her. My biggest disappointment was the lack of relationship development with Max, and I also think they could have cast someone older because the large age difference isn't present here. Overall, I enjoyed this film. It could have went a bit longer, and I was fine with the ending. I actually prefer the ending over the Hitchcock version where Rebecca died accidentally instead of actually being murdered by her husband. To me that totally changes the whole narrative and I'm glad they kept true to the book there. It's a heavier story and I appreciated the upbeat final scene. Definitely a movie to watch and form your own opinions on. If you enjoy gothic romances, give this a chance.",Rebecca

costume design appeared to be true to the era (at least from my impressions)Bad Points:
The second Mrs. de Winter was written to be so shy that she would mend her own undergarments in secret to relieve her from any judgment from her maid, Lily James' version has her looking directly into Mrs. Danvers' eyes and being so bold in front of the staffex. In the novel and in the Hitchcock version (1940), she admits to breaking the cupid statue only in front of her husband and with embarrassment, but in this version she rather confidently, although tearfully, admits to it in front of the staff too, which she is supposed to be intimidated fromMax de Winter is not old enough, he doesn't have the allure of mystery and a tortured soul like Laurence Olivier and most importantly Jeremy Brett had, Armie Hammer comes across as just a rich kidThere was no, I mean non existent, none at all, nuance to Mrs. Danvers sapphic love for Rebecca. It would have been better if the audience was given the chance to pick up on her dialogue and possessiveness of Rebecca to get to that conclusionDanvers was creepy which was great, but a bit too much that it seemed unbelievable that Max did not act up or see how uncomfortable his bride was, almost made Danvers a mother-in-lawthe soundtrack was overwhelmingthere was use of CGI that looked absolutely terrible. Ex. while in the cabin during the confession scene, the second Mrs. de Winter's face is reflected in a dirty mirror but its so obvious that the mirror is artificialLast points, personal ones:-There's a scene in the novel where after Max confesses to the murder and asks his bride "" Will you look into my eyes and tell me that you love me now?"" and he kisses her with such passion and all she thinks of is the curtain behind his head, and she's completely calm although she has wanted nothing but for Max to love her all this time. This is the part that changes her, Max is truly hers and she is no longer insecure. I wish that this scene would be shown, no adaptation has done so.-Caroline de Winter's dress was changed from the large white one that had puffy sleeves and a large floppy hat like the novel and Hitchcock film had to a red velvet one with gold jewelry.

I had trouble understanding why the 2nd Mrs deWinter was made to act so silly until her husband declared he enjoyed seeing her look startled and confused.

It's a great story, of course, with lots of previous versions and the 1940 Hitchcock has long been regarded as a masterpiece of gothic horror although it now looks a very old-fashioned and more than a little bit hammy. This new version is well made, beautiful to look at with stunning locations around Hartland in North Devon (probably the only part of the Southwest coast unchanged since the 30s).

If you throw all preconceived notions out the window and you take it in as is, a kaleidoscope of emotions and sounds and haunting images, as well as the great performances by a trio of incredibly talented actors, you'll find something here that sticks in your brain as Rebecca de Winter does with our heroine.Technically not a masterpiece, but a 10/10 experience in my mind.",Rebecca

The male players are all competent and well cast but the real star is Kristin Scott Thomas as Mrs Danvers, who conveys perfectly a mixture of obsession, love, grief and total lunacy.

315,nicollemelansonpowell,Where is the narrative arc?,6,22 October 2020,"A good story is like a roller coaster of hills and valleys. The hills build suspense and drama and the valleys provide relief and relaxation - and enjoyment. This movie has no valleys and no enjoyment (or very little). The original story by Daphne Du Maurier is of a charming ingenue orphan who meets and falls in love with a mysterious, haunted, sophisticated, aristocrat - Maxime DeWinter. This interpretation is a hero's tale of an abject mouse who survives persecution to rise up over her tormentor, becomes a heroine who thwarts a police investigation to save her husband from prison and even attempts to save her persecutor (Mrs. Danvers) from a watery grave. The main character is so pathetic from the start it is hard to imagine why DeWinter falls in love with her. The transformation from mouse to feisty heroin who beards the lion (Danvers) in her own den is unbelievable, not to mention her transformation into Sherlock Holmes daringly chasing down clues. He, on the other hand is suspiciously bland and characterless; he has been stripped of his personality to such a degree that he is merely a placeholder for 'handsome brooding aristocrat.' Do we even care what happens to either of them? Not much. The complexity of the original story has been replaced with a single note in a minor key; it is repeated in every chord, louder and louder to attempt to build to a climax. I understand that the writers and director were trying to adapt this story for a contemporary audience which is desensitized to subtlety by highly sensational, violent, and epic tales, but they have twisted this story into something unrecognizable to the author and her fans. I gave it 6 stars instead of 5 because the settings are quite stunning.",Rebecca

Sadly, for all the impressiveness of the costumes and locations, the current 5.8 rating is about right. I found myself watching and waiting for something to happen, rather than actually being engrossed in the story. It is rather dull and fragmented, with little suspense and characters you come to care little about. There seems to be little or no repercussions for anyone's actions, and the ending is rushed and cut to pieces.

338,loulou-65445,Beautiful location....but...,5,30 October 2020,"I love the setting for this movie and was perfectly happy to settle into its rather theatrical start. I have no regrets watching it but was rather confused about the potrayal of some of the characters. Ann Dowd plays the excellent aged dowager Mrs Van Hopper whose long life appeared to have fueled her with a roaring furnace of nasty innuedos. I liked the characterisation of Mrs Van Hopper has being a stereo typical witch who despises youth, admire social status and is rather scathing of love. But Mrs Van Hooper's aged witch in this traditional romance should have been offset with an innocent snow white. Lily James with her brassy locks, fabulous wardrobe and come hither looks is no Snow White. Lily James has not even the tiniest amount of sympathy for her horrible but sick employer and is quick to lie to get her on way which would be ok but her decision to spend oodles of time being a wealthy man's play thing seems rather ill advised. However, the shedding of a few tears pays off and Lily Jame's wins her prince being the insipid but tall Armie Hammer. The prince whisks Lily James away to a beautiful mansion where she sits alone with insecure and obsessive thoughts which in turn fuel quite a bit of snooping into her husband's late wife's life. The snooping of course drives her a tiny bit potty. The ordianry kind of new romance potty rather than Hitchcock lock me up potty and hence it appears the story tends to reward her obsessive need for her husbands approval. Likewise her husband killing his ex wife in fit of passion is also considered to be a good thing. In my opinion the true heroine of this movie driven by love to maddness, is Kristin Scott Thomas who plays Mrs Danver's. My heart broke over her unconditional love of Rebecca and her overlooking all of Rebecca's flaws because she sees her adored Rebecca as a women who flouts tradition and needs no prince to rescue her. I adored Mrs Danver's cool icy stares and feel that her story of women in service too old to marry and too old to find another position (no rescuing prince in her life) is a far more interesting tale. Her bitter end was an ode to the only out of many women in her position. Mrs Danver's and Mrs Van Hopper both offer many cynical words to Lily James and many of those words to represent the state of many marriages of that era and the fate of many women. However, in the genre of romance Lily James does not seem to heed the messages from the shadow sides of the older, much lived women and instead seeks only to see the optimistic light of romance offered by her wife killing but insipid prince. Once Lily James has killed off, in her mind, any competition she can settle into being her true good wife self. Hence the final scene depcits a sexy Lily James, smoking with a hot husband in an exotic location searching for a marvellous forever home...which left me mourning all the more for the cold and watery fate of Mrs Davers",Rebecca

347,stjohn-lorca,Lush retelling misses the mark,3,28 October 2020,"""Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again"". As one of the best-known openings to a novel, it deserves to be treated in a film adaptation with all the weight it carries for the reader of the book, imbued with all its evocative Gothic spine-tingling foreboding. And yet, what we get from Lily James's narration is a deadpan, matter-of-fact voiceover that may as well not even be there but for its iconic status. It adds absolutely nothing to the film. This sets the tone for the entire movie: a crisp, loud, overproduced Hollywood slickness at odds with the tale of grimy undercurrents of stiff-upper-lip depravity encountered by an ingenue hopelessly out of her depth in a marriage and a household conspiring, ironically, to keep _her_ the spectre she has always been.
For glitzy production values, this film scores highly. The sets and camera work are lurid, the costumes (barring a ridiculous tweed sports jacket worn with mustard linen pants, repeatedly) in themselves beautiful, the upstairs-downstairs tropes trotted out faithfully; winsome actors behave winsomely (or diabolically, as the case may be).
But, for all the things it could possibly be in 2020, Du Maurier's 'Rebecca' is none of that. Like its eponymous character, it is haunting, spellbinding, unrelenting and perverse. The key source of pathos - and the genius of the novel - is not in the protagonist's clawing at the air or hitching up her skirts and running to her room to weep, but in the sinister, the unsayable, the unsaid. Ben Wheatley, rather, makes a point of saying everything. Loudly. Perhaps such an unsubtle re-telling was calculated to appeal to a lazy contemporary audience, and, if so, it probably succeeds and deserves more than 3 stars.
However, there are so many ways in which Du Maurier's novel can be re-read in the first half of this century that could still indulge well-worn and familiar tropes without dumbing down the screenplay or hamming the acting, or simply trashing historical or textual accuracy (Mrs de Winter's trashy suicide blonde hair, Mrs Danvers wearing makeup). The feminist and queer subtext of the novel, the dynamics of social class, the moral ambiguity of many of the characters, all deserve more than a garish cardboard cut-out treatment in today's cinema that is not hampered by the restrictions that were faced, and so deftly circumvented, by the Hitchcock (there, I said it) version.One cannot, and should not, expect a film adaptation to precisely reproduce a novel. But to turn it into a pop-up book does grave injustice. Even entirely on its own merits, the film does not hold together well. While Ms James tries hard to love the camera, one does not get a sense of her sheer terror, nor her motivation for it - it is all circumstantially dictated by her surroundings, not her performance. Her transformation into a determined chatelaine-detective hell-bent on protecting a husband for whom she had little affinity until he ""opened up and showed his emotions"" will no doubt resonate with some viewers, but, independently of its inexplicable departure from the novel, stretches credulity. As charming as Ms James is as an actress, the role requires more nuance and depth than charm: she does neither dowdy and skittish nor grimly empathic very well. Her success in portraying ""gaslit"" would be more at place in a remake of the famous Bergman melodrama than in a Gothic horror. She looks pretty, but the second Mrs de Winter is not a pretty character.
Armie Hammer as Maxim is unfairly given a character whose lack of cohesiveness renders him almost an afterthought worthy of a romantic lead rather than a man whose demons multiply and torment the immature psyche of his inconsequential second wife. After their initial meeting, belonging more properly to a romantic comedy, there is no chemistry between him and his spouse, not even negative chemistry, purely because there is no substance to him.
Certainly, there are highlights. Kristin Scott-Thomas in particular as Danvers does a commendable job of transcending the flamboyance of the script and direction to create the sense of menace engendered by a character whose derangement and passion have been heavily suppressed.
Overall, if you have not read the novel, or were unmoved by it, then you may well thoroughly enjoy this film for its lushness and the transparency of its narrative. You may find the melodrama compelling and the facility of its ""messages"" easily digestible, but I wanted more of less and less of more.",Rebecca

We all adore the book and love Hitchcock's movie but were prepared to put the first movie aside and watch with fresh eyes. The beginning was promising but it quickly showed that both director and actor had no understanding of Maxim's character. And what was with the awful suits he wore! Lily James looked a little too stylish but was doing her best to appear drab and lacking in confidence but that's hard to pull off when the director has your character experiencing a heady romance. In the book it's almost a complete surprise when Maxim asks her to marry him as he alternates between hot and cold with her but instead we were presented with a conventional love affair blossoming between them. I guess this was immediately an indication that we were not going to be treated to the nuance and subtleties which were a highlight of the book and the first movie.Things were progressing at a reasonable, if not enthralling pace, until the party scene - after that, it pretty much plummets downhill by giving us an emasculated Maxim and our heroine completely changing character by becoming the hero to the lost and hangdog wimp of a man that Maxim has become. As to the big reveal!! Well, it was definitely a whimper rather than a bang.And what can I say about those awful tacked on ending scenes - ugh!! Badly written, badly acted and added nothing to the movie. No, Mr Wheatley, that was an amateurish ending that did nothing for your movie.",Rebecca

The fact that people hated her character means that one should really congratulate LJ for her successful portrayal of Mrs de Winter, which I think is loyal to the book. Although I wish some of the scenes where longer to allow LJ to really act out the emotions.I thought the Manderley set is marvellous, though some important points are missing, like the rhododendrons imagery or flowers in the valley. Also agree with some of the other reviews that suspense was lacking and it does feel rushed. But overall I liked the film and makes me want to read the book again.",Rebecca
358,jorgesilvamarques,I would frankly use the work 'crime'...against the Cinema!,1,28 October 2020,"Its'a a crime. Not against Hitchcock, but against Daphne Du Maurier's story and its characters, against cinema, and against good taste.
First, the people who wrote this haven't understood the story.
There should be an age difference between Maxim and the new Mrs. de Winter. That's important because they are not supoposed to understand each other completely before Rebecca's body is discovered.
Instead of speaking freely and asking bluntly ""how did your wife die"" in the first meeting, she is supposedly shy, not experienced, but well educated. She comes, however, from a different social standing and - no - this is not a question of ""discrimination""! That's simply how it was. And in the film - and I think the novel - she is not barred from the terrace of the hotel: she is simply sitting at another table, net to Maxim!..
The woman playing Mrs Van Hopper is a disaster!!! She looks like an old drunken hippie, and absolutely not like a 1930's american millionnaire. The scene where she mocks the girl with her friends or acquaintances is in terrible bad taste and unthinkable. Also unnecessary.
If you make a 1930's movie, it's not just about cars and dresses. You have to understand the mentality. And that mentality is a very important part of this story!!!
Also, girls wouldn't know about 3.5 liters Bentleys ""because her father liked cars""!
The whole thing is a disaster. The one star I gave the movie is for Armie Hammer, the only one who seems to know more or less what he's doing, though he seems to be drowning in an Ocean of stupidity!
Like someone else said: if you can't do any better, you'd better do nothing!!! Or ask someone who knows something about it!!!",Rebecca

360,magdalenabing,Such a waste of great source material,3,24 October 2020,"I love the novel, as so many people do, and I find it rather disappointing to watch it be wasted on such a bland and uninteresting movie.First of all, Lily James is far too charming and beautiful to play a convincing Mrs. De Winter. Don't get me wrong, she is lovely in every single way, but that's the problem! Mrs. De Winter is supposed to be an ordinary and insecure young girl, but Lily just reeks of confidence and beauty! The film does it's best to dress her down in plain and colorless clothing but it's no use. She simply has far to much personality to come across as someone unnoticeable. No way near the pale and reticent girl we follow throughout the book.Armie Hammer is a couple of years her senior, at best. The whole plot of Rebecca is built upon the insecurities of the new Mrs. De Winter, and that includes the very noticeable age gap between her and Maxim. In the film, this is completely left out and we are given none of these power dynamics whatsoever. They look as if they could be the same age!Kristin Scott Thomas is brilliant as always, but she comes of more creepy than anything. Mrs Danvers is supposed to be mysterious and cold, not explicitly evil like some kind of devilish caricature. There really is no need to give this character away so early in the film. The suspense of whether or not Mrs. Danvers was evil or if it was all in the main characters head was half the fun of the book.The movie also does quite a terrible job at making us wonder whether or not the previous Mrs. De Winter is haunting Manderley or not. In the book, us readers are given a decent amount of time to ask ourselves this very question. Is Rebecca actually terrorizing the main character? Is her ghost wandering the grounds at night or even planning to return with the help of Mrs. Danvers? It's a ghost story without an actual ghost, which is part of its brilliance.Never mind this review if you like soapy Netflix versions of things. Like most Netflix productions it looks really good and has very good looking actors in it.",Rebecca

369,jjmcgee-11045,Enjoyable,7,5 December 2020,"I am not sure why people feel the need to dump on this so harshly. It had a few problems: the overuse of computer graphics, for one. However, if can you enjoy it without spending every minute comparing it to the Hitchcock version, it is a simple escape. Even though it went against the book, I enjoyed the fact that they were closer in age, and the chemistry that brought with it. Her employer can then raise a question about trapping him with sex that continued to resonate for me, as a source of the character's doubts about her marriage. Hammer's performance also brought out something I hadn't perceived before, which is Maxim as a (psychologically) abusive husband. Until the big reveal, he is becoming a man she'd do well to leave. It was interesting to see her take a more proactive role in saving him. For those who wonder about her willingness to stay with a man who killed his wife, Du Maurier clearly intended Rebecca as an evil, abusive character who knew how to provoke him into a crime of passion. Finally, I liked that the ending allowed them to have some happiness together. I have never understood why in the novel after the events of the story, they are living what seems like a colorless, almost unhappy life together. They have lost Manderley (though he still has the land and wealth, presumably), but Manderley was a burden to both of them in different ways. He was not imprisoned for what anyway would be termed a crime of passion. They love each other. Of course, it's not a truly gothic novel if they are happy in the end. And perhaps it was the convention of the time, that because the crime went undiscovered (but not unpunished, re: the actions of Mrs. Danvers), they can't be truly happy. Anyway, this version allows them to be free and together...even though it leaves a chill when the ending implies that she now has a bit of Rebecca's ruthlessness.",Rebecca

378,KarebearAngel21,"Decent, but weird additions.",5,17 November 2020,"Overall this was a decent adaptation of the book ""Rebecca"". I will start with the positives. In small ways it actually was more true to the book than Hitchcock's famous adaptation 1940 film of the same name. The cinematography was fantastic, and the shots were stunning. A lot of gorgeous views.
The acting was okay. It going to be difficult if you have seen the original and are expecting Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine. While Armie Hammer and Lily James are fine, they don't match up. The stand out is easily Kristin Scott Thomas. She steals the whole film, which isn't surprising - it's Kristin Scott Thomas!
This version actually sticks to Maxim shooting Rebecca, as he does in the book, rather than her falling and hitting her head. So, points for that. Though, they added extra scenes like Mrs. Danvers throwing herself into the water to commit suicide rather than dying in the fire. It wasn't needed.
The reason this isn't getting higher stars from me has got to be the very end. We see a changed Lady de Winter smoking cigarettes with an ominous crashing of waves as we cut to black. Neither the book or Hitchcock's version took this dark turn. It takes away from what the character had to overcome in the film. It changes the whole story - and in a bad way. Had they left that entire scene on the cutting room floor, this would have been a better movie.",Rebecca
379,austinfan82,A well done adaptation!,9,22 October 2020,"As a huge fan of the original Hitchcock I was really looking forward to this version. It did not disappoint! Lily James makes you feel how much Mrs DeWinter is haunted by the memory and ""legacy"" of Rebecca. Kristen Scott Thomas as Danvers🙌🏻 And Armie Hammer shows us a Maxim that is still plagued by the past but who tries to forget.
I didn't go into this comparing the two films. That would have not been fair as not only are they 80 years apart but also the Hayes Code back then forced Hitchcock to change a key part in the film/plot from the book. And actually having watched this version with that put back in its rightful place made certain scenes much more intense.
The original will always be my favorite Hitchcock film. And that being said I still say give this a try! Let this version be it's own and enjoy it for what it brings to the table.",Rebecca
380,jfindever,Will watch again,8,8 November 2020,I thought the movie was very good. The period clothing was excellent. Lily James was perfect as the 2nd Mrs. DeWinter as was Kristen Scott Thomas as Mrs. Danvers. Armies Hammer is awesome eye candy.,Rebecca
381,Spania,"A terrible mongrel halfway between ""Crimson Peak"" and ""The Great Gatsby""",2,26 October 2020,"I have to acknowledge that I absolutely love both the novel by Daphne du Maurier on which this movie is based and the original film adaptation by Alfred Hitchcock. So I already had misgivings upon finding out that a remake was going to be made... and starring no other than Lily James and Armie Hammer! To me, that was no incentive to watch the new version. That being said, I decided to give it an opportunity. But to no avail.First of all, like I just said, I find that Armie Hammer and Lily James are completely miscast as Mr. and Mrs. de Winter. I don't really like Lily James as I find most of her performances (e.g. in ""War and Peace"", ""The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society"" or ""Cinderella"") rather insipid. Still, I think that she can do a good job if given some specific kind of characters, like Lady Rose in ""Downton Abbey"". As for Armie Hammer, he is not one of my favorite actors either, but the problem for me remains the same: he just does not fit into this role! His looks, age and acting style just make him unsuitable. Of course, it would be really difficult to find two actors who would equal Joan Fontaine's and Laurence Olivier's performances, but I think the casting team was simply looking for two popular young actors. Hence the miscasting and the lack of chemistry between them. However, I must concede that Kristin Scott Thomas was a good choice for Mrs. Danvers. I wouldn't have thought of Sam Riley as Jack Favell, but he is not bad either.However, the cast is only one of the many issues with this film. Almost everything, from photography and special effects to music or costumes (Mrs. de Winter wearing trousers? Come on!), seemed so absurd and out of place to me - to say nothing about the film pace (at some points, especially at the beginning, I felt like I was watching a trailer rather than an actual movie) and simply the way the story is told, its tone and aesthetic. Starting with the scenes at Montecarlo where Mrs. Van Hopper hysterically makes fun of the protagonist because of the way she behaves with Maxim and that sex scene at the beach (really... WTF? It felt like a perfume commercial), followed by Maxim's sleepwalking, the Manderley ball, that melodramatic murder trial and everything else... Many important details of the story were poorly explained, and I could not help but laugh at the way some of the original movie's capital scenes (Mrs. Danvers encouraging Mrs. de Winter to commit suicide, Mrs. de Winter showing her frock for the ball...) were copied.To conclude: I am a millennial who loves both classic and contemporary cinema. I am not particularly conservative in my taste and I always feel curious about remakes. And still, this is not worth watching. 2/10.",Rebecca
382,bowey_a,"Perfect casting, a stand-out film",9,27 October 2020,"This one is a gem hidden amongst the many misleading/ badly written dross on Netflix. Armie is very well cast as the English country gent and Lily James plays the helpless, niave but later hidden-strength lead well. The head housekeeper role, is the only downside as a one sided character who keeps banging on about Rebecca tirelessly - please talk about something else woman!Really enjoyed the outfits/ style/ locations and I felt this all captured the era well.Good job",Rebecca
383,stjarv,"I'm not a devoted Hitchcock fan, I was really looking forward to this, but ...",3,28 October 2020,"I am not a devoted Hitchcock fan, and while I enjoyed his version, I never found Laurence Olivier a convincing lover. Charles Dance did a much better job in the '90s miniseries of Rebecca. I have seen Armie Hammer and Lily James in other films and enjoyed watching them. So, I anticipated this version eagerly, and expected to enjoy it, especially as I had read it was not a remake of the Hitchcock version, but had gone back to the novel. I do not think the problem with this version is the acting, it's the script. I had read the novel many years ago, and re-read it recently, which is perhaps why I found this version so jarring. Max De Winter was a strong and ethical character (apart from that incident with his first wife LOL). Yet here he is portrayed as a wimp, submitting to blackmail, and sitting around with his head in his hands while his second wife is off saving him. This did not happen in the book, or the Hitchcock film or miniseries. Max refused to be blackmailed and was instrumental in finding evidence to get himself off the hook. The second Mr de Winter was a cringingly timid character, completely lacking in self-confidence. Yet here she is driving Max's expensive car, marching into the servant's hall, sacking Mrs Danvers, organising a ball and ultimately saving the day. None of which happened in the book, or the Hitchcock movie, or the miniseries. This complete change in the characters and the plot is what spoils it for me. It is also completely incongruent. This story is set in the 1930's, most confident women didn't behave with the independence that the second Mrs de Winter did in this film. This tinkering with the past, trying to re-write history is very annoying. Another example is with Max's great aunt Caroline de Winter, in this film it was stated that she was one of the earliest women doctors of her time. Another complete fabrication. Yes, we should have strong female character in film and TV, but set them in a realistic time, or make it a fantasy (eg Wonder Woman). The only redeeming feature of this film was Kristin Scott Thomas who did a wonderful job as Mrs Danvers. I'm left wondering why the changes in the story. Did Netflix think they could improve on the story written by Daphne du Maurier? Did the political correctness department intervene? As the lead actor, did Lily James demand a better role, to be the hero? Whatever the reason, for those involved to say they went back to the source material, ie the novel, is astonishing.",Rebecca

It was not outdated, nor was it dull, but this script does not do the original source any justice, and unfortunately the acting even feels dull. All characters lack the depth they have in the book, especially Maxim de Winters.
Not only does the beginning of the movie feel rushed, but for the first time ever, I was seriously bothered by the music.

393,becshotton,Haunted by the ghost of,5,21 October 2020,"Rebecca is one of my favourite books, and, to pre-empt my review, I am somewhat biased in that I've seen the 1940 and 1997 adaptations too. This film is alright, especially for people who haven't seen the others or read the book, but in that case I would recommend just watching Hitchcock's film.The characterisation seems very off to me. Lily James, though excellent, is too well-known to effectively play a timid, schoolgirlish character like Mrs. De Winter, and her age difference with Armie Hammer, who is far too convivial and nice throughout the film, makes the relationship seem perfectly innocuous and healthy. It isn't, and we shouldn't think it is. The dialogue pertaining to Mrs De Winter's youth is almost entirely cut - where once she wished to be ""a woman of 36, draped in black satin and a string of pearls"", now she essentially...is that woman already. Maxim no longer refers to her as a girl, a child, or a lost thing, and the film suffers for it.Manderley, too, possesses none of what the book or Hitchcock film did. The opening sequence, the exploration of the West Wing, and the final scene do nothing to create a sense of mystery and intrigue - and the number of scenes of servants walking around, giggling, eating, and even singing raucous post-war songs effectively Downtonised the Gothic manor into a placid stately home, which Lily James is unfortunately associated with already.The numerous nightmare sequences throughout the film are laughable, in particular the scene where Mrs De Winter is pulled into the floor by a devil's snare-style vine, and the lingering presence of Rebecca feels pithy; no rhododendrons, no lingering footsteps, and no crashing waves that call her name.Overall, I'd recommend this film, but only as a contrast to the 1940 adaptation, and both of them still pale in comparison to the book. Prepare yourself, though, for Maxim's fiendish mustard suit, worn over four times, and for overt sex scenes that present the estranged couple as perfectly happy before the Big Twist.",Rebecca

The movie didn't inspire questions/mystery and left nothing to the imagination or interpretation- which is the key point of the book. Instead of having empathy for the new Mrs. de Winter and what she experienced on a daily basis, I found myself annoyed by her insecurities. Though cinematically beautiful, it was disjointed and lacking. The talented Armie Hammer wasn't a fit for the mysterious mister de Winter. The same with Lily James.

but I prefer the Hitchcock version more than this , because it is exactly like the book.",Rebecca
397,sbdavis-62597,Haunting film,8,23 October 2020,"Ignore the harsh critics. This is a well-crafted film that deftly blends the beautiful and the dark gothic with skill and vision. Please understand that this is a film adaptation of the novel by 20th C gothic writer Daphne du Maurier--it is not a ""Hitchcock remake"" as others claim. And you really need to read the book to appreciate some of the subtleties of this film and its depiction of the narrative.
Some of the criticisms of the film are really about the novel itself. While perhaps Armie is a bit young to play Maxim, he did a marvelous job of conveying Maxim's inner demons which drove his mercurial nature that could be warm one moment and cold the next. I thought there was great chemistry with Hammer and James-a little more subtle than what some reviewers here wanted, but that is the way the book was written. DuMaurier writes their marriage as a bit paternalistic and refined but still loving and supportive (not Cathy-and-Heathcliff-combustion). The actors and director did a very good job of echoing that relationship with a little more passion thrown in for modern tastes. Lily James is perfect for the doe-eyed, ingenue role, and although at times her mousy, nervous deference was annoying, it's pretty darn close to the novel's depiction of her character. The show-stealer, though, was Kristin Scott Thomas who played her role of the sinister Ms. Danvers with frighteningly steely perfection. It's hard to make KST look unappealing, but the severity of her appearance and mannerisms here reflected the troubled darkness lurking beneath her polished veneer and wry, artificial smile. Brilliant performance.
What I really appreciated about this film was the incredible attention to detail and emphasis on the house as a reflection of the narrative. Everything from the ivy-patterned bed linens (invasive, suffocating, creeping) to the image of new Mrs.DeWinter blending in to the landscape in an ill-fitting green coat that was Rebecca's (she is disappearing in a role she does not fit) to the staff looking past her as they walk by (she is now the ghost in Manderlay), shows a thoughtful effort to visually echo the narrative tension. The cinematography-esp. the play of shadow vs light and dark/grey vs vibrant color- and the opulent sets and exotic locations make this film a feast for the eyes.
I don't agree with others who feel the second half was rushed. I wish the movie had been longer to allow for more development with some characters and plotlines, but it's very difficult to portray this complex, twisting story in a short period of time. Overall, it was an enjoyable film that I'll watch again. Just remember to view the film through the lens of an 82-yr-old novel, not a modern script.",Rebecca

Well worth it!",Rebecca
400,rikakemme,Why remake a film when you have nothing of interest to add?,2,23 October 2020,"Right, so, since we so admire Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca we're going to make a new adaptation, only:We don't like the extremely shy personality of the protagonist, it's just not very 2020, so while she still remains somewhat insecure, we're basically making her a completely different person, who takes charge of situations, has no qualms about having pre-marital sex with Maxim, firing Mrs. Danvers (twice!), and breaking into doctors' offices in the middle of the night.We don't like the age difference of at least 20 years between the protagonist and Maxim de Winter, so scratch that.We think the story lacks excitement and action, because we either don't appreciate the subtle build-up of tension in the book, or we don't trust our audience to. Therefore we're adding extra intrige, an arrest, a bribe, and a criminal investigation that wasn't there before.Building on the previous point, come to think of it, we don't even like the thirties and the British mentality of that time, so let's only alude to that, in an almost comical way, and meanwhile have everyone practice only the bare minimum of stiff upper lip, while also giving away bits of information that aren't supposed to be shared with the audience until much later in the story.Lastly, we either don't think there's enough drama in the story or, again, don't trust our audience to pick up on it, so we'll throw in a last emotional scene with the protagonist and Mrs. Danvers, who subsequently throws herself off a cliff.Now, halfway through watching I figured I was probably unfairly biased, because I'm a big fan of the book and have already seen two film adaptations of it, my favourite being the 1997 one with Charles Dance and Emilia Fox in the lead, so I thought: maybe I should keep an open mind and just view this as a completely new interpretation of the book.
However, the crux, the axis, the pointe of Rebecca, no matter how else you may interpret it, is the lack of communication and making of assumptions between Maxim and his second wife that causes the wildest misconceptions on both sides and gets dramatically revealed near the end. The protagonist's very shy and insecure personality, the age difference between her and Maxim, and the obsessive adherence to decorum of the time actually go a very long way in explaining how this can happen in the first place. Leaving all these factors out, or at least diminishing them severely, and also giving away too much along the way (like the early mention of Rebecca's note) chipped away at the mystery and the suspense and therefore took away a lot from the eventual reveal. The reveal which, by the way, seemed to kind of ""got over with"" as quickly as possible, so the train of events could get picked up again.In conclusion: it's as if the original story first got wattered down in essentials and then enhanced again by the addition of a lot of unnecessary drama. I don't see what this film was supposed to be adding.I still award two stars because there was one alteration I rather liked: the fact that Mrs. van Hopper was on to what the protagonist was up to. When you think about it, that actually makes a lot of sense, because in a hotel like that there would be a lot of gossip and the comings and goings of Maxim de Winter would definitely not go unnoticed, as, for some reason, they did in the novel.
Also: I liked Keeley Hawes as Maxim's sister.",Rebecca

That's what made the scene where Maxim finally confesses what happened to Rebecca so potent. Finally, they (Maxim and the second Mrs de Winter) are able to be intimate because Maxim has let down his barrier.
In this movie, they are all over each other from the outset.

418,jonelle-57510,A Very Meh Visit to Manderley,5,23 October 2020,"'Rebecca' is one of my favorite books so I am always excited when a movie adaptation is released. This version of Rebecca missed the mark. Armie Hammer, while quite dashing in his own right, is no Laurence Olivier. He lacks some of the character's brooding sophistication and mystery and seems a bit too young for the part. (Hammer is about ten years younger than the Maxim character as written by Daphne DuMaurier.) In the book and the 1940 Hitchcock adaptation, the 20 year age difference between Max and The Second Mrs. DeWinter gave the relationship an air of old time romance and tentativeness that added to the suspense. The more obvious physical intimacy between Max and his new bride in this iteration is a surprising, interesting and not wholly unwelcome revelation but one that does not stay true to the essence of the original story. Lily James as The Second Mrs. DeWinter is respectable, as is Kristen Scott Thomas as the unhinged Mrs. Danvers but I wish they had both played their roles with more intensity. Compared to the performances by Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson, respectively, the new takes on the characters lacked passion and wound up feeling anemic. (Anderson is downright spinechilling as Danvers in the 1940 version so I imagine her shoes are hard to fill.) This version also lacked the necessary moodiness, suspense and depth of the original, and the pacing was off. Some scenes in the beginning dragged out at the expense of more key scenes especially in the end, which felt rushed. And the ending (read: last two minutes) is AWFUL. It is a total departure from the overall tone of DuMaurier's novel. The characters go, well, completely out of character and honestly, this kind of ruins the whole film. On the upside, the scenery is lovely and there are adorable dogs in supporting roles. While it's worth watching, the 2020 version of Rebecca cannot hold a candle to Hitchcock's pre-WW2 masterpiece. I don't care to go back to this Manderley again.",Rebecca

420,yektakhalili-33340,Do not go into this thinking it's a remake of the 1940 movie,8,23 October 2020,"I've been reading reviews and the single biggest reason people don't like it is because they are comparing this to the 1940 classic movie by Hitchcock. This is simply another book adaptation. With a couple of major differences, this sticks to the book very well. It's not without problems, but I must say, the few great aspects of this film are so good that they enhance the whole experience and make this deserving of a higher rating.Starting with the negatives so I can gush over Lily James and Kristin Scott Thomas for the remainder; I must say the movie had serious pacing and editing issues. Some scenes were too short, cut abruptly to the next and seemed misplaced. It's like they shot 100 scenes, and just cut and pasted them one after the other. My other issue with this movie was the soundtrack. Hearing modern songs just takes you out of the movie. And the suspense music that plays loudly whenever you're supposed to be on the edge of your seat does the exact opposite. I truly believe the movie would have benefited from less music. Let the silence add to the unsettling nature of this story.Then we have the issue of tone. The famous Daphne Du Maurier book navigates the transitions between romance, thriller and mystery perfectly. There's an air of darkness everywhere, and it's mainly because you're in the mind of the main character when she's being harsh on herself and anxious about everything. That anxiety is translated onto the screen by one means: Lily James. That's it. The movie doesn't do anything to help her. The color are bright, the costumes are beautiful, the soundtrack is sexy... I wanted more torture, more anxiety. The only time I got that was when Lily James and Kristin Scott Thomas were together on the screen. More on that when I write about what I loved about it.The last issue I had with this was Armie Hammer. It's not about his age, yes he's not 42 like the book - but it's him in general. He's basically eye candy, and I couldn't help wonder what it would have been like if someone with actual acting abilities had played Maxim. He didn't exactly play the quiet, depressed, powerful man. He was just a bland, rich, handsome dude. He didn't command respect and he wasn't mysterious. I can't really think of anyone who would have done this role justice, at least not anyone who's around Armie's age. I keep thinking of Alexander Skarsgård, but he's older. Also, what was that accent? He just sounded like someone who was trying to sound old Hollywood.Now, off to the good bits. The good bits are so good that I kind of want to re-watch this movie multiple times just to witness them again.Lily James was the single best thing about this movie. She's proven she's a talented performer multiple times now, but this is a difficult character to play. In the book, you understand her because you're literally reading her thoughts. To translate that into a performance is a daunting task which I believe she absolutely nailed. The nervous, shy quality of her character in the beginning of the film came across as authentic. To credit the writers, this was also because of scenes like her dropping the money when trying to bribe the staff or walking in front of a group picture being taken, etc.Then gradually, this character grows and matures. It's so subtle that you can't really decide when exactly it happened. But when it's half way through the movie and you go back to the start, it's so apparent. This is the single best development I've seen in recent years. There is no ""I have to come into my own and be a woman warrior"" moment. It just happens organically, and that's in a large part thanks to Lily James. She play someone insecure, unsure, and vulnerable who matures into the person that fights for what she wants brilliantly.Then, the best thing about the movie: When Lily James and Kristin Scott Thomas appeared on screen together. Their scenes were intense, unsettling and charged. Lily's body language, the actual terror and discomfort in her manner and Kristin's powerful presence and haunting gaze was just the best thing. I would watch a whole 2 hour movie with these two just staring at each other! The scene where the second Mrs De Winter finds Rebecca's room and Mrs Danvers shows her around is the best scene of the entire movie. The colors are just right (the icy blue tone of the room, Lily wearing a blue/green shirt, Mrs Danvers in navy blue) gives you the sense of coldness, the acting is top tier and the dialogue is brutal. To think that they have these actors to work with, and can actually create scenes like this that have you hold your breath throughout and didn't utilize that is disappointing.So to sum this up, I enjoyed this film for what it was. A Netflix movie. It's clear they didn't want to make an Oscar-winning film. (They really could have, though) This is a romantic mystery, not thriller. The editing is problematic, and Armie Hammer does nothing but to be tall and handsome. However, the movie has a secret weapon in Lily James, and a winning combination of her and Kristin Scott Thomas. I'd say the whole thing is worth the watch just for these two. My 8 rating is simply because these two were beyond excellent.",Rebecca

The casting is very weak with Lily James totally miscast and floundering as Mrs Dr Winters. Kristin Scott Thomas gives a good performance as befitting to the role she is cast with. However the original Mrs Danvers appears to be much darker. There is no no gothic backdrop or feel to this adaptation in comparison to to the 1940 Alfred Hitchcock film, that creates that psychological suspense. Some classics such as Rebecca are best left with their original version.",Rebecca
424,topper-43854,Disappointing,1,23 October 2020,"As a fan of the original movie , I found this to be a terrible remake ant I could not watch the entire thing . Had to watch half the next morning . Armie Hammer is not Olivier and James is no Joan Fontaine and the theme of the older man and the timid young woman was not part of this movie. Mrs Danvers wearing makeup ?? In addition the clothing was not the right attire for the period , except for the one skirt that was similar to the original . In the original version Manderly was a scary looking place but in this movie it was just a house I could go on and on, but this was so sad. I personally am returning to Manderly tonight , but the original version as I want to forget this one",Rebecca
425,jlourema,A disaster,1,23 October 2020,"What is the reason for making a new adaptation of a literary work? That is the question every filmmaker must ask himself before facing this task. Apparently, the director and scriptwriter of this new version of ""Rebecca"" never asked themselves; or if they did, they found answers to that question they could not transcribe in images and on the film itself.
If it was just showing scenes in the south of France on screen: welcome; serves as a tourist reference. But by trying to approach the book with ""more fidelity"" than Hitchcock did, they managed to get even further away from the Daphne du Maurier story.
""Rebecca"" is a gothic novel, something that the makers of this version seem to be unaware of; or maybe they don't know the meaning of ""gothic"" or how it is translated into a movie.
The answer is simple: see the 1940 film by Hitchcock, which, even affected by the implacability of the Hay's code, not only manages to reflect the essence of the novela, but also transcends as a classic, a masterpiece of cinema.
This mess is just that: a mess. A subset of mediocre performances coupled with poor production (it is not known why, because this film obviously had a much larger budget than Hitch had). And the two main characters are a disaster. Lily James (not a bad actress, let me clarify) all the time overacts her role as a shy and insecure creature, to the point that it becomes very annoying. Armie Hammer is pure vanilla, without a trace of guilt, problems and insecurities; a pretty face to wander around the screen from time to time and attract sighing damsels. Mrs Danvers is stripped of all the sexual ambiguity that the novel, and the 1940 film, subtly suggest. Honestly, the performance of Scott Thomas is the only reason anybody could claim for watching this film, and even her is limited excessively by the script.
The ending of the film is really so out of character and far from the novel that it is, in itself, tragic. The reality is that this film is neither a romantic comedy, nor a mystery film, much less Gothic at all, as it is the novel on which it is based. So, what is it? Well, you don't know: it wants to be everything (perhaps to appeal to a larger audience), but it is nothing. Rather, something is: a disaster.",Rebecca

Maxim was unexplainably absent in key scenes of tension that never happened. There was no motivation for any of the characters.
Danvers and Mrs Dr Winter suddenly becoming BFFs seemingly at random made no sense.

I am doing this because I have been very disappointed with the reviews I read for this film before I watched it. Not having read the book and only vaguely remembering the Hitchcock version I have viewed it with fresh eyes and an unbiased preconception. It is a brilliant film. The quality of the production is amazing with crisp photography, lovely locations and superb costume selection for the period. And the cars! Fantastic.
The story was very engaging in the way it was presented, the acting mostly excellent, particularly the female leads. Not so sure about the male lead, a little bit stiff, but maybe that was intentional.
Don't miss this film because of negative reviews, it is well worth watching (on Netflix, if you are like me and subscribe).",Rebecca
446,regiergal,Not as terrible as all these reviews say,7,30 March 2021,"So Rebecca follows the whirlwind romance and and subsequent complications of Mr. Maxim De Winter (Armie Hammer - I know 😬😖) and his new wife (Lily James). This film is an adaptation of the novel of the same name, and follows the new Mrs. De Winter as she attempts to fill the shoes of the mysterious, alluring, and tragically deceased late Mrs. Rebecca De Winter.This film is a beautiful period piece with fabulous cinematography, and very textured settings. It's kind of a slow burn, and definitely takes you on a ride. However, I felt that the pacing was very stunted, and alternated wildly between sprinting and walking painfully slow. The mystery of the story is doled out carefully, and the tidbits the film gives you make you work for them in patience for sure.Although this film has been generally panned online, I actually kind of enjoyed it. May have been because I set the bar pretty low, but it was still an enjoyable experience.A word of warning - don't let the trailer fool you. This is not a psychological thriller mystery - although it certainly has its moments. It's more a frantic and super tragic love story, where you just feel bad for Lily James because *nobody is nice to her at all* which is super tragic.All in all, 7/10 - would recommend if you're interested, but wouldn't try to make you watch it if you didn't want to.",Rebecca

452,serabella09,A muddled mess,3,28 October 2020,"Didn't convey many of the cornerstones of the original film... for example, Max de Winter (Armie Hammer) seems distracted when you first meet him. He's not tortured and complicated like in the original. He lacks subtlety in the way he courts the young girl who becomes his second wife. When later they are married, his many outbursts seem unreasonable and though it hints at a complex backstory, that is never explored further by the film maker. In the original, their stories interweaved together to create a tapestry of intrigue centred around the house. In this, the house just served as a location where it all takes place. It has no intrinsic value in and of itself.Lily James was too naive and helpless to have ended up in a situation like that, manipulated at every turn, by all and sundry. At least in the original, Joan Fontaine had one eye open to all the predations that might await her as she joined Manderley. The new version has that character completely devoured by circumstance only for her to rise to the occasion in the latter half of the film which seemed unlikely at best and risible at worst. Kirsten Scott Thomas was probably the best thing in the film. She holds her own against the original Miss Danvers with her cold implacable exterior and distorted devotion to the former lady of the house.

Disturbia, Flightplan and A Perfect Murder are the three that I think did it well. Updated enough to make it new and relevant without destroying or trying to mimic the original which this version of Rebecca does. I also think Max's rival fir Rebecca's attention Sam Riley as Jack Favell needed to be a more devious and less slimy character. There needed to be depth to the deceit between them.
All in all a nice way to depend a few hours but not a real hit.",Rebecca
471,julialourenco,A good romance and a bad suspense,6,14 November 2020,"The first part of the film I really enjoyed it. The shots were pretty and the evolution of they relationship was fun to watch. On the other hand, when the drama and suspense comes in, everything got boring. At first I thought they would try something new in the history (with a ghost twist), but that didn't happen.
You should go to the Hitchcock's one.",Rebecca
472,jenniferkaydavenport,Excellent adaptation of a classic,9,24 October 2020,"I can understand the negative reviews from anyone who is unfamiliar with the book. As someone who absolutely loved the original book , I thought this was a wonderful adaptation that stuck very closely to the original. I thought the actors chosen were perfect for the roles, and I liked this a lot more than the pbs adaptation, although that one wasn't bad either. I'd recommend it 100% to anyone who read and enjoyed the book. For others, I'd recommend if you're into gothic brit lit. It's not an action flick, so don't expect to be on the edge of your seat. But give it a shot and you might be surprised.",Rebecca
473,dscragg,"Not the book, but I liked it more than Hitchcock's",7,26 October 2020,"Comparisons between the versions are unavoidable.It's pretty much impossible for a movie to take the time and care required to properly build up the tension created in the novel, that's why I never really took to Hitchcock's version. It felt like a SparkNotes of the book to me. A highlight reel of plot points without the required buildup of tension.Rebecca (2020) could equally benefit from perhaps another 20 minutes of run time to build tension, but the time it does use was in my opinion more effective than Hitchcock's even if some of the dramatic devices were less subtle than I would have liked. Read the book if you can, it's a masterpiece but if you only have 2 hours this is worthier of your time than most movies.",Rebecca
474,gingerb-47013,"Suspenseful, dramatic, and beautiful",9,26 October 2020,"I may be the one of the only few to leave a positive review about this movie, but I stand by it. Some say it was slow based, but I feel it needed to take the time it needed to explain the story. The actors could not have been casted better. I kind of liked the ending, since I felt the ending in the book was a little more cut-throat and abrupt. It definitely tied up more loose ends and I appreciate the closure. It's definitely worth the watch, whether you like it or not.",Rebecca
475,hgco,"If you want to read the book, read the book",10,13 November 2020,"Such a shame a good movie like this is getting bashed by people who read the book and are hoping the movie lives up to their imagination. I did not read the book and thought the movie was a breath of fresh air from the mindless Super Hero, Zombie, and Dystopian movies that are constantly coming out. Yes, it was a remake of 1940 movie, and is based on a book... Could it have been better? That's not for me to decide.But as someone who knew nothing about this book/plotline, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. My family and I were guessing throughout the movie what was going to happen, and the plot twists were great and took the movie in directions we were not expecting. Things at the end progressed a little quicker than I would have liked. I thought some of the scenes at the end could have been drawn out and developed more... But then again, the movie was already over two hours long. It's impossible to capture every detail of the book in a movie. I do not know what all was cut, but we thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and we walked away from it feeling like this is one of the best movies we've watched this year.",Rebecca
476,shonnahands,ABSOLUTELY Loved it!,10,21 October 2020,"ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!! A wonderful adaptation with perfectly cast archetypes of powerful women, the men paled by comparison which was a welcome contrast between 1940 and 2020 direction as well as a spotlight on how well Du Maurier channeled timeless female strengths 80 years ago!For me the garish yellow suits the alfa males cowardice; fear of the past, of betrayal and of losing face. This actor was very close to the Maxim in my mind conjured from re-reading the book a 1000 times; handsome, commanding, hotheaded... weak, petty and insecure defined by privilage rather than character.We are not meant to love nor fear Maxim, he is an object of pity; a male in distress. It is the simpering, unnamed heroine who defeats her dragon, embraces her dead rival, rescues her man and lives on...The book strikes a chord with women and this film highlights and celebrates girl power where Hitchcock placed artful, broody shadows, perhaps to keep the book within his social lens and time.Comparing Netflix with old Hollywood is absurd and unfair, the critics are trapped in Hitchcock's vision not Du Maurier's book and have missed the magic of this telling... obviously nothing can touch the 1940 masterpiece however this film, in many ways is more honest towards Du Mauriers cunning flip of stereotypes which shocked her generation and helped to shape and define mine.",Rebecca
477,dvorovaya,At least the outfits are beautiful...,5,2 December 2020,"I haven't seen the original neither have I read the book. But this movie was filmed in 2020 so I expected to watch a movie that is appropriate for 2020. I can say nothing about how it lacks all it's gothic or mysterious atmosphere. But it definitely lacks logic. Why was this girl so persistent in making herself miserable living with abusive husband, abusive maid, being gaslighted in someone else's home? She was orphaned just 2 years ago so no explanation there. She had a job before she met her husband, so not there as well. Why? I really want to know. And if it's just a story about that anyone can became the victim of abuse, ok, fine, tell me the story. But nope, I'm not getting it. You can't call a film ""romantic"" or ""ghost "" story and give us an abuse story instead without explaining everything at all...",Rebecca

It is beautifully filmed and romantic with some moments of suspense. It's easy to watch, I wouldn't describe it as particularly gripping and you probably won't think about it much afterwards but it is entertaining.",Rebecca

482,peterenescu,"Complete Story, Moving Theme",9,23 November 2020,"I believe a lot of the reviews I have seen unfairly compare this iteration of a wonderful book and classic film too much to its predecessors instead of letting it stand on its own two feet.If you look at the story development, attention to detail, cinematography, proper acting and development of several nuanced themes ~independently~ then its a fantastic movie.The casting was great and I loved the chemistry between the characters. The shots, colors, transitions are indicative of a qualified director and crew. And finally, I believed it's story was properly developed. Moreover, if you watch it a second time you greatly see their attention to detail and wonderful foreshadowing elements.Perhaps it might be lesser in comparison (which could be attributed solely to nostalgia, one might argue), but that doesn't make it a poor film by any stretch. I was deeply moved and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",Rebecca
