0,TheLittleSongbird,20 years later...and worth the wait,7,16 January 2018,"John Carpenter's 1978 'Halloween' is wholly deserving of its status as a horror classic. To this day it's still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror's most iconic villainous characters Michael Myers.Which is why it is such a shame that not only are all of the sequels nowhere near as good but that the decline in quality is so drastic. Ok, the original 'Halloween' is very difficult to follow on from, but most of the sequels could at least looked like effort was made into them. The exception however is 'Halloween H20: 20 Years Later'. It's not perfect and nowhere near as great as the original, but it's the only sequel that's above average, let alone good and by far the best since the original. It does a great job breathing fresh life into a series that had gotten stale as quick as one can down a can of coke gone flat and such a welcome addition after the badness of the fifth and sixth films. 'Halloween H20: 20 Years Later' has its flaws. It is too short and at times erratically paced, sometimes rushed and then taking a bit of time to get going after the opening. There is not enough breathing room for development of characterisation, which generally is shallow apart from the central relationship and the script tends to be weak (not unexpected, though actually it's far worse in the previous sequels, at least it sounds complete).On the other hand, 'Halloween H20: 20 Years Later' is the best-looking of the sequels, the first half in particular being close in style to the autumnal look of the original, something that none of the previous sequels did. The editing is coherent, it's not shot too darkly and there is an eeriness to the setting which can be properly appreciated as a result. The music is a welcome return to being an asset than a drawback like in the previous two sequels. While not quite a character of its own like in the original, it adds to the atmosphere and enhances it.Luckily there's nowhere near as much unintentional camp, out of place humour or bizarre subplots or idea that muddle the story. Instead much of the film is fun and there is a tension, creepiness and suspense, even poignancy at times, that the previous sequels were sorely lacking in. The deaths are the most creative and shocking since those in the original, while the opening scene is unsettlingly tense and the ending is creepy and touching. The central relationship is handled quite well. Although the characters are underdeveloped, none of them are annoying and they do have enough personality to stop them from being too dull. The direction is in control of the material and is at least competent and often well above that, especially in the second half when the film really does come alive. Of the sequels, 'Halloween H20: 20 Years Later' is by quite some way the best acted, Jamie Lee Curtis' wonderful performance being the film's best asset.In summary, the best of the sequels/follow ups and worth the wait. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
1,Leofwine_draca,"Too clean, too many plot holes, too many false jumps, and self-referencing",4,25 July 2016,"Yet another HALLOWEEN sequel, this one directed by Steve Miner, the guy responsible for Friday the 13th Part 2 and HOUSE. As to be expected, it's not much cop, following the modern horror conventions too closely and therefore failing to generate any surprise or thrills by the fact that we already know what's coming. The plot is terrible, with events which occur not being explained or explainable, and details being passed by or glossed over in favour of dumping the cast and the killer in a deserted school.Watching this film, you will spot many take-offs of other movies (Michelle Williams looking out of the window and seeing Michael just like Curtis did in HALLOWEEN). The director would call these ""homages"", I myself call them ""lack of ideas"". Also, surprisingly, there are many continuity errors and mistakes. I wish they could have taken a little more time to polish things instead of rushing this out and leaving all the errors in, it really makes the editors look incompetent.While no actor is particularly bad, nobody really shines in this film. Adam Arkin (in some medical television series I believe) is pretty bland as Curtis' grey-haired lover who wears jumpers just like my old grandad. LL Cool J lends some comic relief as he recites erotic stories to his wife on the phone, but this humour is out of place in a HALLOWEEN film and just doesn't fit. Can someone explain to me how he was shot seven or eight times (twitching as the bullets entered his body) and yet manages to survive? The last we see of him is his corpse, laying in a pool of blood and riddled with bullets, then he returns at the end to tell us that the bullets only 'grazed' him. Yeah, right.The young cast are all pretty bad and sort of merge into one, nobody is memorable. Michelle Williams is in fact awful as a female token love interest, but to be fair she is given literally nothing to do in the story apart from run around. The only one who's at least partially adequate is Josh Hartnett who plays Laurie's tough son, he manages to be both believable and likable. Unfortunately he is in it too little, as Jamie Lee Curtis dominates the film. Much has been made of how Curtis puts in a brilliant portrayal of an alcoholic woman plagued by nightmares, but to be honest she wasn't that brilliant. Good, perhaps, but not brilliant, and her performance was definitely not enough to make this film into a classic.Which leaves us with Michael himself. Once again he's played by a different actor and he's even more absurd this time around, with his spiky hair bushing around the sides of his mask. Excuse me? Not the Michael I know, get yourself a haircut man. Unfortunately the camera dwells on his eyes far too often, making him not in the least bit scary, for as they say, the eyes are the windows to the soul. The murders are all clichéd and generic, the only good bit being where a girl has her leg broken and nearly ripped off. Otherwise it's the typical slashings and stabbings which we've seen millions of in these past few years.Leave it to Kevin Williamson to pepper the film with unwanted in-jokes. Janet Leigh has the PSYCHO music playing, while characters watch SCREAM and SCREAM 2 on televisions. These I could have done without; this is meant to be a horror film, not a comedy horror like SCREAM was. What an arrogant fellow that Williamson seems to be. There are other elements which are pretty nauseating too, like a poor actor doing an impression of Donald Pleasence (they dedicated the film to him, but managed to spell his name wrong in the process!). HALLOWEEN H20: TWENTY YEARS LATER is better than the previous sequel (thanks to a refreshingly short running time), but even so it's only average at best, marred by one too many false jumps and a lack of real scares.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
2,SnoopyStyle,At least Jamie Lee Curtis is back,6,1 November 2015,"It's almost Halloween 1998, Langdon, Illinois. Dr. Marion Chambers's home is ransacked and the file on Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is gone. Marion and a few neighborhood kids are soon killed by Michael Myers. In Summer Glen, California, Laurie is still haunted by what happened 20 years ago. Her new name is Keri Tate. She is now the principal of a private school where she works with boyfriend Will (Adam Arkin). She's a divorced mother to John Tate (Josh Hartnett) and overly protective of him during Halloween. Molly Cartwell (Michelle Williams) is his girlfriend. Charlie (Adam Hann-Byrd) and Sarah (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) are his friends. Ronny Jones (LL Cool J) is the school security guard.For fans of the original, this is a functional sequel. Jamie Lee Curtis is back as the best thing in the movie. Her character is scarred and interesting. The kids are alright. LL Cool J sticks out like a sore thumb. He's suppose to be the comic relief but he's ill-equipped. He makes this too cheesy. This could never live up to the original. Times have changed. They even have Scream 2 playing in the background. Still, Jamie Lee Curtis is as great as ever.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
3,Prismark10,Myers stalking and slashing,3,6 November 2018,"Set 20 years after the original Halloween movie and featuring Jamie Lee Curtis again as Laurie Strode.Still traumatised over the events concerning Michael Myers, she is now an alcoholic divorced mother of teenager John Tate (Josh Hartnett) but she still managed to become a high school principal under an alias name.This does not stop Michael Myers finding out where she lives and goes looking for her while slaughtering teenagers that get in his way. Laurie who is paranoid that the boogeyman will one day come looking for her finds out that he has returned.Laurie is not going to take things lying down, she goes to take him out head on.There are some in jokes, Janet Leigh, Jamie's real life mother pops up with the stirrings of the theme from Psycho. There is a chance to see some actors making early appearances such as Michelle Williams and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.The film suffers from horrible pacing problems and too many false scares. I was bored by the first two thirds of the film and it only picks up the pace in the latter part of the film. Even with getting Jamie Lee Curtis back to the franchise, it is a movie that had no new ideas. Worse it is beyond silly as LL Cool J's school guard managed to survive so many bullets.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
4,Sleepin_Dragon,A great sequel.,8,23 October 2018,"After so many poor follow ups, H20 serves up thrills and spills, with the franchise managing to go bigger, and yet get back to basics.It's well acted, very well paced, and entertaining from start to finish. It's also nice to see the hunted become the hunter, great to see Laurie get revenge on her sadistic brother.Curtis is great, Hartnett is cool also, although why's he wearing a shirt six sizes too big for him?Some great moments, it's very suspenseful, kind of builds on the success of the Scream franchise, it very much has that vibe as opposed to it's predecessors.One of the best. 8/10",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
5,gavin6942,Another Scripting Mess,6,21 November 2010,"Laurie Strode (Jame Lee Curtis) is a headmistress at a boarding school with a 17-year old son. She had faked her death and changed her name... but Michael Myers is more determined than she hopes, because he finds her! He's going to get her! The director, Steve Miner, and writers decided to treat this movie as if Halloweens 3-6 never took place. This was a decision made to keep the plot simple and focus on the Laurie character. It also makes the continuity even more confusing... if both Jamie Lloyd and John Tate are Laurie Strode's kids, when were they born??? Why did one come with her and not another? This semi-reboot does clear up the stupid cult subplot, but does not make the series better in any way. Sure, we get a young Michelle Williams (presumably because of Kevin Williamson's involvement) and a film debut for Josh Hartnett. We get Janet Leigh driving the car from ""Psycho"" and making comments about being ""maternal"" to her real-life daughter... but then, we also get LL Cool J.I want Steve Miner to explain this film to be. Miner has been involved in a lot of great horror films in one way or another... to put him on this film gave it some weight, but he didn't do anything here other than tarnish his (possibly) good name. I want to remember Miner for ""Friday the 13th"", not this rubbish.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
6,lee_eisenberg,things work when mother and daughter co-star,10,29 November 2006,"Probably the main reason that we can hold ""Halloween H20: 20 Years Later"" in high regard is simply because it brings back Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). But there's something else: it takes a cue from ""Scream"", going for a mildly campy approach (in one scene, they even watch a scene from ""Scream 2""). Unlike most horror flicks, there's no gratuitous sex. They definitely chose to focus on Laurie - even going so far as to include some character development. As for Michael Myers, he still goes around killing anyone who gets in his way; watching him, I almost wanted to root for him. An obvious difference between this one and the previous installments is the absence of Sam Loomis, as Donald Pleasance had passed on. Well, they still know how to make the movie come out good.As for the rest of the cast, Josh Hartnett as Jamie Lee Curtis's son didn't really catch my attention. Michelle Williams catches my attention now more than she did when the movie came out, due to her roles since then (namely ""Brokeback Mountain""). But one of the most impressive people in the movie is Jamie Lee Curtis's horror veteran mom Janet Leigh, driving her car from ""Psycho"" (and she still looks hot after all these years!). Also starring Adam Arkin, LL Cool J and Adam Hann-Byrd.So anyway, you're sure to like this movie. And it just might save your life. Because we're all entitled to a scare...",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
7,jboothmillard,Halloween H20: 20 Years Later,5,11 January 2006,"This is the film that both celebrated the 20th anniversary of the first Halloween film, and it also returned Jamie Lee Curtis to her starring role. Basically it has been 20 years since Laurie Strode, or Keri Tate (Curtis) last saw her psycho brother Michael Myers, the killer in the white William Shatner mask. She still fears of being killed, and also fears for her son, John Tate's (Josh Hartnett) protection. She eventually finds out that he is still alive and will do anything to kill him for good. The final sequence is the best, when Michael is pinned to a tree and Laurie is feeling his fingers, before chopping off his head. Also starring LL Cool J as Ronald 'Ronny' Jones and a brief Janet Leigh (Curtis's Mum) as Norma Watson. A good instalment to a crap saga, but the first film will always be the best. Worth watching!",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
8,BA_Harrison,"Having just finished watching Halloween H20, I have a few questions...",5,11 November 2011,"Parts 4,5 and 6 didn't happen, right? So where the hell has Michael Myers been hanging out for the past two decades? Is Steve Miner the epitome of mediocre? How does LL Cool J keep getting acting work? Does Michael Myers' William Shatner mask contain Starship Enterprise-style technology that allows him to beam himself wherever he wants? Does Josh Hartnett cut his own hair? How many false scares is too many? Is Michelle Williams' sexiness directly proportional to the length of her socks and the shortness of her skirt? John Carpenter's contribution aside, could this film have a more generic soundtrack?Aimed at an undiscerning post-Scream audience, Halloween H20—with its derivative poster, irritatingly 'hip' young cast members, an uninspired plot, and not nearly enough gore—is bland, formulaic tosh that recycles genre clichés that weren't all that fresh when director Miner last used them in his Friday the 13th sequels a decade and a half earlier. Only in its closing moments, when Jamie Lee Curtis's Laurie Strode says enough is enough and picks up an axe to confront her bro, does anything remotely of interest happen, the final showdown between siblings being sufficiently tense and exciting, and the finale satisfyingly brutal.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
9,moonspinner55,"Depressing, dispiriting hack-'em-up",2,31 October 2005,"A sad botch of a sequel (in a film canon that's had more than its share), featuring Jamie Lee Curtis in a return to role as Laurie Strode, one-time babysitter, now headmistress of a private school, facing down bogeyman Michael Myers one final time. Thriller has a nice cushy budget and some smarts and satire at the beginning, but it quickly turns into yet another 'dead teenagers' movie. Absolutely devoid of wit or suspense. Surprisingly, Curtis put this one together, but series originator John Carpenter is nowhere to be found (although the picture tries hard to mimic his style). A bloody waste of time! * from ****",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
10,Quinoa1984,"Not the best, but it doesn't aim low either",5,5 December 2000,"Like a couple of the other Halloween movies, this one actually tries to please, and does (sometimes).  Probably the best thing is that they finally threw out the old 3 film plot with Myers after Laurie Strode's daughter and grandson, and finally goes back to the good old Myers versus Strode.  Which also means Jamie Lee Curtis come back for a return film, and a change of pace.  Off and on entertaining (depending also if you enjoy seeing LL Cool J reading love poetry), and a topper of some other bad horror films, but also suffers way too conventional storytelling and screams.  But hey at least it seems like this COULD be the last Halloween finally and without a title conveying it.  B-",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
11,Coventry,"Once a scream queen, always a scream queen!",6,5 October 2005,"The majority of influential movies receive a special anniversary DVD-edition when they turn 20 years old, but John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" got rewarded with a complete sequel in which the original heroine Jamie Lee Curtis returns as the character that made her famous. But the real guest of honor at this party is, of course, good old white-masked Michael Myers, who's still surprisingly brisk and swings his butcher knife around as energetic as he did two decades earlier. The boys who came up with the idea of making this belated sequel were quite clever, since the 'slasher' was hugely popular in 1998 (thanks to Wes Craven's ""Scream"") and it was a matter of course that the resurrection of the legendary Michael Myers would become a big hit. Still, I'm not complaining because I honestly feared that the result would be a lot worse. As expected, the script pretends that all the other sequels were never made and picks up right on the events after Halloween II. The first half of the film is very dull and unpromising because the writers found it necessary to supply Curtis' character with a whole complex background. Supposedly, she moved from Illinois to California and changed her identity, and now she's the headmistress of a fancy school where also her 17-year-old son attends classes. She's an alcoholic an overly protective mother, constantly living with the fear that her brother will come back This whole background situation is quite a contrast with Carpenter's original, as the character drawings there were very limited. Halfway in the film, however, director Steve Miner seems to realize that ""Halloween"" isn't at all about emotions and drivel but about slashing, and so the action-packed and exciting finale saves the entire movie. Michael commits some very nasty murders and Curtis picks up her old scream queen reputation. The acting performances are very good, even though the casting LL Cool J and Janet Leigh were totally redundant. Good fun and nice reworking of John Carpenter's original score, by the way.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
12,michaelRokeefe,"A frightened, haunted woman finds closure.",6,21 January 2000,"Michael Meyers is back. How and from where is not explained. His sister played by Jamie Lee Curtis has lived in fear of his return for some twenty years.  Her anxiety and fears have left a shambles of her life. The relationship  with her 17 year old son is falling apart. In spite of changing her name and taking on the job of dean of a private school; Michael is back to display his brand of bloody terror. A well rounded cast for a slasher flick: Adam Arkin, Josh Hartnett, LL Cool J, Jodi Lyn O'Keefe and Ms. Curtis' mother, Janet Leigh.

13,hitchcockthelegend,Brotherly love just went down another notch.,7,1 November 2015,"It's 20 years since Michael Myers Haddonfield, and in particular Laurie Srode, his sister. Laurie faked her death and is now a divorced mom with a teenage son. Michael is on his way to finish the job he couldn't finish two decades ago.A true and honest Halloween/Michael Myers film this one, there's the distinct feeling that the people behind the series wanted to show that they remember what made the series popular in the first place. It's still the stalk and slash formula of course, but Jamie Lee Curtis returns and her character is nicely written. She's obviously still haunted by events passed and needs a stiff few drinks from time to time to keep the edge off. Yet she's in charge of a private school and is a stern but adoring mother to her son (Josh Hartnett). And she has a boyfriend (Adam Arkin) who cares for her.The first half of film sets up Laurie's new world, while we jump back and forth observing Michael on his journey to final destination. Once the second half revs up, it's the scare time as Laurie's son and his friends come under great peril, which we know will lead to a final confrontation with Laurie. The kills strike hard, the suspense is ramped up, and then it's a frenetic action based finale capped off by a coup de grace of some distinction. All in all it's just a very good and proper Halloween/Myers movie. It didn't reinvent anything, it just turned the wheel full circle and arrived at a fitting closure. 7/10",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
14,Theo Robertson,A Very Good Franchise Movie,7,30 October 2005,Don't ask me why but I couldn't help being involved in the pre title sequence of H20 . I mean how many times have we seen a madman stalking his victims in a dark house ? Too many you say ? I couldn't agree more but director Steve Miner has managed to make this sequence tense and exciting The story is held up slightly after this as we're introduced to the characters . Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Laurie Strode who having survived the previous encounter with Michael Myers now has a drinking problem . Perhaps not the most radical or original example of character development but character development of a sort . Obviously Michael Myers is just as you'd expect him to be . He says nothing and goes around killing horny teenagers Interestingly enough while horny teenagers having sex are expected to be bumped off in this type of movie there is no on screen sex in this movie and there's nothing to indicate that none of these teenagers have lost their virginity . They're no angels but they're not promiscuous sex pigs either . Deliberate post modernism on the part of the writers ? Possibly since we see two teenage girls watching a clip from SCREAM on TV so make up your own mind and it's good to see a horror film with some lighter moments which come from a performance by LL Cool J as a cop while at the same time the humour never becomes OTT By no means a classic example of cinema H20 is a fairly impressive movie for what it is - Yet another sequel in a horror franchise but one that kept this sometimes demanding viewer entertained,Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
15,Scarecrow-88,Halloween H2O,7,24 October 2009,"Myers takes one hell of a beating, that's for sure, and Strode gets plenty of whacks(licks)in before one final chop does the trick. As I've already mentioned, Halloween H2O is more akin to Carpenter's masterpiece than the remakes you see as of present, more closer to scares(..Michael in hiding, just around the corner, appearing when characters least expect him)than violence and gore. Interesting enough, it's nearly the 50 minute mark before Myers even is able to gain access inside the private school which is guarded by stone walls and an iron gate. And, the body count was always developed from the start to be relatively low.Director Steve Miner isn't known as a slasher filmmaker whose movies are heavily depending on gory violence, his Friday the 13th movies nowhere near as shocking or repulsive as what we see nowadays. Halloween H2O is more about Michael pursuing Strode with those in his way becoming collateral damage. The homage to Psycho(..along with wonderful casting of the late Janet Leigh as a busybody who works for the school, having some nice scenes with Curtis whose teacher becomes awfully annoyed with her, an aspect echoing Carpenter's The Fog)is pretty sweet, the camera work and lighting first-rate, and having Curtis as the central figure provides the film with a professionalism the previous sequels simply lack.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
16,Hey_Sweden,Now here's a family reunion for you.,7,3 November 2011,"The real appeal of this sequel is seeing Jamie Lee Curtis return to the role of Laurie Strode, in a story that disregards everything in Parts 4, 5 and 6, picking up 20 years after the events of Parts 1 and 2.Laurie Strode is now a headmistress at a remote private school (having faked her death and assumed a new identity) and a functioning alcoholic who's still plagued by nightmares of her murderous brother...who inevitably comes calling.""Halloween H2O"" is very much in the mode of post-""Scream"" slashers with the attractive, hipper-than-thou cast of young actors in addition to established veterans like Jamie Lee, Adam Arkin as her nice guy boyfriend, and Jamie Lees' real-life mom Janet Leigh, in a role that has obvious but endearing references to ""Psycho"", which featured Leigh. It really is a treat to see them do scenes together. LL Cool J is rather amusing as the security guard, as is Joseph Gordon-Levitt in his brief pre-credits bit. It's quite nice to see Nancy Stephens return to the role of the nurse whom she played in the first two films. Josh Hartnett, in the part that ""introduced"" him, does a decent job as Lauries' frustrated son who ultimately realizes the truth behind his mother's greatest fears.The film reunites Jamie Lee with director / genre veteran Steve Miner, with whom she'd worked on ""Forever Young"", and Miner does a respectable job; this is certainly slick looking stuff, although it tends to rely too often on jump scares rather than suspense. Michael Myers, this time played by a stuntman named Chris Durand, is too much of a lumbering brute and lacking in a true creepiness factor (not to mention the fact that the mask this time is *terrible*). It would have been better had the original Donald Pleasence monologue been used over the opening credits; the actor reciting it just doesn't sound like him and it's just not the same.Now, these things said, there are some good things about ""Halloween H2O"", especially the echo of ""Frankenstein"" wherein Laurie finally must make the decision to face this demon that's haunted her for so long; particularly fun is the scene where Michael is flipping tables to get at her. It's also chillingly effective when the two first come face to face, separated only by a door. The ending is fantastic, with one Hell of a final punch line.Not a great ""Halloween"" series entry, but a pretty good effort overall.Seven out of 10.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
17,preppy-3,The best horror sequel ever!,10,11 March 2007,"This movie ignores Halloween's 3-6 (good idea) and picks up 20 years after the end of ""Halloween II"". Laurie Stode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is living in fear. Michael's body was never found after the fire in ""Halloween II"" and she thinks he's still out there looking for her. She faked her death, changed her name and has a son (Josh Hartnett!). She works as an English teacher at an exclusive (and secure) school. Them Michael suddenly appears again...and goes after Curtis, her son and anyone in the way.Just excellent sequel to ""Halloween"". There are numerous references to the first two films and other horror films. It has an intelligent script, is well-directed by Steve Miner and (for once) doesn't treat its audience like a bunch of idiots. There IS one point that bugged me a little--where has Michael been for the last 20 years? But I was so entertained by this movie I didn't really care. Curtis (humorously introduced screaming her head off) is just great--one of her best performances ever. It was her idea to get this film done as a treat to horror fans AND to end the series for good. Hartnett is terrible (no surprise there) but the rest of the supporting cast is good and Janet Leigh has an amusing cameo (note the car she's driving--it's the same one from the 1960 ""Psycho""!).I was lucky enough to see this in 1998 with an audience full of horror fans. We all had a great time--we got all the references right off and cheered every single time people kept fighting off Michael. Only a true horror fan can understand how GREAT it felt when Curtis grabbed an axe and went out calling for Michael! Also the ending is just perfect. The series should have stopped with this but (unfortunately) we got ""Halloween: Resurrection"" which was just hopeless.Still this is a great, rousing and excellent horror film.

19,poolandrews,"""No sex games until after I've eaten."" The worst big budget post Scream teen slasher.",3,6 July 2006,"Halloween H20: 20 Years Later starts in 'Langdon, Illinois' where a nurse named Marion Whittington (Nancy Stephens) arrives home to find her house has been broken into, the police are called but they arrive too late to prevent Marion from having her throat slit by notorious serial killer Michael Myers (Chris Durand). It turns out that Whittington was Dr. Sam Loomis's (Donald Pleasance) nurse & the file on Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) she kept at home is now empty... It has been 20 years since Laurie Strode went through the horrifying events of Halloween (1978) & Halloween II (1981) & needs to take half a bottle of pills just to get through the day, she also suffers from nightmares & hallucinations. She now goes by the name of Keri Tate, she has a son named John (Josh Hartnett) & has a nice job as headmistress of a private school in the Californian town of Summer Glen. But Michael now knows where she is & is determined to finally kill her along with anyone who tries to stop him...The seventh film in the long running Halloween series & directed by Steve Miner I personally thought Halloween H20: 20 years Later (what's with the 'H20' in the title? Isn't H20 the formula for water?) was crap, it's as simple & straight forward as that. The script by Robert Zappia & Matt Greenberg is terrible, for a start it's one of the slowest & dullest horror films I've seen in a while. I'm not kidding when I say that almost an hour passes without a single kill, a single moment of suspense, a single naked body or any sort of interesting storyline. For some bizarre reason Halloween H20: 20 years Later focuses almost entirely on Laurie, now character building is fine but I would like other things to be happening to hold my interest & since the first two Halloween films were all about Laurie most of the audience will already know about her & her relationship with Michael. As countless boring scenes that go nowhere came & went I started to get really bored, at least chuck a few kills in there to keep me awake guys! As most people seem to comment I think the last 15 or 20 minutes is pretty good as it finally decides to become a horror film. However as far as I was concerned it was far too little far too late to save this lame, limp & tame excuse for a horror film.Director Miner does an OK job, everything looks very nice & he does the whole Scream (1996) thing with plenty of homages & in-jokes. I didn't think Halloween H20: 20 Years Later was scary at all, in fact it nearly put me to sleep. This has to be one of the tamest, most bloodless slasher films of recent times. There are three discovered dead bodies, a slit throat, a stabbing & a quick decapitation that doesn't feature a single drop of blood.With a very healthy sounding budget of about $17,000,000 Halloween H20: 20 Years Later has that Hollywood polish to it & is generally well made. The acting was OK & that's it, LL Cool J was the obligatory comic relief, black character & minor celebrity all by himself!Halloween H20: 20 Years Later was a huge disappoint for me, even though it scrapped all the stupid plot threads & ideas from the previous three sequels it doesn't have any new or worthy ideas of it's own. This is overrated junk that has to be worst of the modern teenage slasher film, then again I've never seen the eighth instalment Halloween: Resurrection (2002)...",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
20,utgard14,Not great but better than the series had been in awhile,6,14 November 2014,"Twenty years after he last tried to kill her, Michael Myers has found his sister Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) living under another name. She has a teenage son (Josh Hartnett) and is haunted by what happened all those years ago. Now she has to find the strength to conquer her fear and destroy Michael once and for all (as if!).Jamie Lee Curtis returns to the franchise that made her a star. She does a good job with obviously unchallenging stuff. This is Josh Hartnett's film debut and he appears to have cut his own hair without the use of a mirror. Michelle Williams plays his girlfriend. LL Cool J has the funniest line when he tells Hartnett to comb his hair. Adam Arkin is possibly the most out-of-place actor to ever appear in a slasher flick. It's nice to see Janet Leigh with her daughter. The script here is nothing special but miles better than the last few Halloween sequels before it. The continuity doesn't match up as the movie basically ignores every Halloween movie since part 2. This was executive-produced by Kevin Williamson at the height of his relevance so it has that Scream vibe to it, although certainly not as good. The kills and jump scares are unimpressive. Overall I'd say it's watchable enough due to the actors' personalities but there's nothing exceptional about it. If you're a fan of the series, particularly the first two, you'll probably like it. They should have ended the series here.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
21,Boba_Fett1138,Brining the Halloween-series to the modern horror era.,6,13 October 2009,"This Halloween movie entry was an attempt to reboot the series, after the last couple of disappointing sequels. The previous Halloween movies were all somewhat classic in its execution as slashers. This movie is however being more like the modern type of horror movies that we now, which all sort of started off 2 years prior to this movie with the movie ""Scream"", which was basically a reboot of the slasher genre as a whole. This is obviously a ""Scream"" inspired movie with its approach, which not in the least should also probably be due to Kevin Williamson's involvement, the man who wrote the Scream movies and helped to produce this movie.As a reboot, all I can say is that this movie is not being any better or worse than most other genre attempts. It serves its purpose well enough but it does so with featuring very little groundbreaking stuff. It's a formulaic movie.The movie is mostly being different, when compared to its predecessors, in its approach of the Michael Myers character. He's featured more prominently from early on already and simply starts going on killing-spree once more, 20 years later after the first, John Carpenter directed, Halloween movie. In this movie he's more being simply the killer instead of the supernatural and psychotic character, like how he got portrayed in the previous movies.For this special 20 years later reboot, Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her role again as Laurie Strode, the character which she played in the first two Halloween movie entries. She is a welcomed addition to the series again, especially after the passing of Donald Pleasence in 1995, who had played in every previous Halloween movie thus far. it however makes it all the more weird that Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't ever really become the main and central character of the movie. The movie prefers to put its emphasis on the young teenage characters of the movie, such as Laurie's 17-year old son, played by Josh Hartnett in his movie debut.None of the characters really work out in the movie though, which is most likely due to the fact that the movie doesn't really have one strong lead in it. It also doesn't help the development of the characters that the movie is only 86 minutes short. Once things really start to hit off, it's over already.Director Steve Miner already gained some experience within the genre and directing sequels to genre classics, by directing 2 Friday the 13th sequels in the early '80's. He's mostly a director of some very mediocre movies though and he's a director that mostly works for TV anyway. In that regard this movie is really still among his better ones.A reboot that brought Halloween to the modern age of horror film-making but without making the movie really anything renewing or spectacular to watch.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
22,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,I know what you did last October 31st,6,4 February 2010,"So, this one does try to go back to how it started, and there are numerous things in this that are a lot like the original one was. The ""almost POV shots"", the theme(possibly beefed up a little... anyway, it's good; with that said, why Sandman again?), and a few other things. Hey, that sounds great on paper... what's the problem? The execution. Cheap scares multiply like genetically enhanced rabbits(seriously, I think this is the one that has the most in the entire series), and while the very ending is satisfying in a way, it is a tad ""meh"" after all that build-up. Then there are the characters... they're not all irritating, and none are as obnoxious as those of the three follow-ups immediately preceding this, but you don't get attached to them, and thus you don't particularly care if anything happens to them or not. The acting varies; however, none of it is neither terrible nor amazing. Jamie Lee Curtis does well, and Arkin isn't bad. Jodi Lyn O'Keefe is hot as she always is, though her role isn't memorable. The script is more Kevin Williamson than John Carpenter, and thus this winds up being closer to Scream than to Halloween. I do enjoy the homages to both of the aforementioned, and they tend to be well-integrated. The plot is largely an excuse for a 20-year reunion movie, and it shows. There is some clever dialog, and it's well-delivered. At its best, it is exciting, suspenseful and tense... it's unfortunate that it amounts to so little. There is plenty of brutal, bloody, violence, a bit of gore, and frequent moderate to strong gratuitous language in this. The DVD contains a 6-minute-long behind-the-scenes featurette, pages of trivia in text-form and trailers. I recommend this 77-minute(!) slasher mainly to fans of the recent batch of them... you know, the ones for the MTV-generation. 6/10",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
23,view_and_review,Lacking,4,12 March 2007,"This is why many scary movies suck. They spend an inordinate amount of time setting up the kills with mundane, boring, or even annoying scenes that are called ""exposition"" as if we care anything about the characters to be butchered. Occasionally we get a scary movie that has an interesting story along with the killing. This wasn't one of them.It's 20 years since the first ""Halloween"" and Laurie Strode (JLC) is still alive after being presumed dead (she was conspicuously missing from parts three through six). She now lives in northern California under the alias Keri Tate, has a son (Josh Hartnett), and is now the headmistress of a private school. Laurie has an acute fear of Halloween for the obvious reason, and she is trying unsuccessfully to get her son to embrace that same fear.Michael Myers begins in Illinois where he kills a few people to find out where Laurie Strode is located. Michael Myers seems to have the same passion for blood and wanting to dissect his sister. I would think by this time that he would have given up. We find out that Laurie faked her own death to escape Michael. Of course, he finds out where she now lives, steals two cars, and drives across the country to Laurie's precise address.This is now part seven and it feels like it too. The franchise is just running on fumes. Even the normally stoic and slow footed Michael Myers lacked enthusiasm in this movie (as if that is even possible). Michael looked less menacing than he ever did and I think it's because he was too clean like he bought a new mask and clothes for the occasion. The only difference this time around is that Laurie decides to stay and fight Michael which neither she nor anyone else did before.Anyway, Michael got a paltry six kills that weren't very satisfying. The movie was just lacking overall.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
24,evanston_dad,Surprisingly Good,6,1 November 2005,"""Halloween: H20"" makes an obvious effort to return to the franchise's roots and recapture the qualities that made the first one so good. It doesn't come close to succeeding, but it does manage to become, in my opinion, the second best of the series, though that's pretty faint praise.There are some creepy scenes early on in this film (the one in the deserted rest stop bathroom, most notably), but this movie really exists for the sole purpose of having Jamie Lee Curtis kick Michael Myers's ass, and the catharsis in watching her do so is worth the price of admission. There are some obligatory killings, but they go for gruesome rather than frightening, which was not John Carpenter's approach. But when Laurie Strode takes matters into her own hands and comes after Michael with guns blazing (so to speak), hold on to yourselves--violent tendencies seem to run in this family.The producers of this movie use a bigger budget to add some modern ""scary"" sound effects for atmosphere and fill out John Carpenter's original score with a sweeping orchestra--it's like John Williams' version of the Halloween theme. The whole thing feels like it's running on an I.V. drip of pure adrenaline. But fans of the series, or at least of the first two films, should enjoy it.LL Cool J is totally wasted in the token black character role, and Janet Leigh makes a pointless appearance as well, but listen for the brief strain of Bernard Herrman's ""Psycho"" score in one scene with her.Grade: B",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

Yet even though she has since given birth to a son, ""John Strode"" (Josh Hartnett) and has a fulfilling job as the headmistress of an elite boarding school, she is still haunted by the feeling that Michael is still out there-looking for her. What she doesn't know is that Michael has not only recently visited Haddonfeld but has also discovered where she lives and is leaving a trail of bodies on his way to her once again. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, even though this is the 7th film in the series, it turned out to be one of the better sequels overall as it incorporates more suspense instead of the mindless action sequences found in most of its predecessors. Along with that it also happens to be one of the most profitable sequels in the franchise as well.

She faked her death and changed her name and has a seventeen year old son who is unable to cope with her past. As predicted killer Michael Myers returns and hunts down Strode and hacking up teenagers along the way before the violent showdown. Director Steve Miner does his best. He is well equipped for this film after having directed Friday the 13th, Part 2 and Part 3 but his best effort in the genre came with the horror comedy House. Curtis is basically there for a fight and she delivers but we long for the quality role she had in the original. Josh Hartnett as her son spends most of the film whining while Michelle Williams plays his girlfriend who listens to him whine. Adam Arkin plays the cardboard new man in Curtis's life. LL Cool J even pops up in this revolting entry, and without so much as a catchy rap tune to liven it up. So does Myers die? Well, based on human standards, yes, but one has only to reflect upon Jason Voorhees and his brutal dismiss concluding Friday the 13th, Part 4: The Final Chapter.

One of those elements is the inclusion of suspense, which makes a welcome return here and gives several grand sequences that display that point. There's a great deal of time here detailing the explanations of the change from the story previously told in the franchise as there's some fun times here detailing what happen and how they're affected so far, though it doesn't get better until the later half when he arrives at the school to stalk her. From the stalking in the courtyard to the romantic evening being crashed and the chase through the school, where the dark, dimly-lit corridors, unused classrooms and maintenance rooms provide a slew of suspenseful locations away from the usual trappings in Haddonfield, there's some decent enough scenes here that play nicely into the action here. The discovery of the bodies in the kitchen features a chilling visual and is nice as well, with the rampage through the school being good use of that area, and with the added bonus of the stalking scenes providing some thrilling call-backs to action from the original as well in the closet breach and the mistaken identity thread. Still, this one is at its best with the final encounter here which is a fun, rousing and wholly thrilling back-and-forth stalking throughout the school which is a fantastic stalking scene that really works on its own and as a fitting epitaph for the series. Along with a pretty menacing-looking Michael it manages to get some good aspects. It's not without some flaws, as there's a couple issues here. The main reason to hold this back is mainly in the fact that there's not a whole lot of time to it anyway, as the whole film is over pretty quickly anyway. This is the shortest entry in the series as it clocks in at less than eighty minutes, and with credits it doesn't even crack eighty-five. The film spends an incredibly long time on the early family drama and her past desires to move on that there's barely any time for the real horror as this one should have had a longer confrontation, as a final battle should be. It is a shame that the film never had a final, all-inclusive battle as the far-too-brief final encounter that really should've gone much longer than it does can't due to the rather overlong beginning without much stalking. Also, the film doesn't have a substantial amount of gore for being so recent, and offers up plenty of rather discrete stabbings only in here, even bringing back a potential kill for a false scare. These here were the film's only real problems, and it turned out quite fun overall.Rated R: Graphic Language and Violence.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

It's short which is a bonus for any horror movie, as we are more or less thrown straight into the action. The film obviously owes a lot to the Scream franchise as we get a very good pre-credits sequence and we also get ironic scares too. Curtis is great as the tortured strode, now a little more wiser, and a little more drunken.Hartnett puts in a good first role, and even the cheap George Clooney who plays the school councilleor is convincing.And there is even one of the coolest nods to a film in the history of cinema ever, thanks to a certain car, piece of music, and Janet Leigh.Myers is as you would expect, too cool to run, but gets there anyway.So it's a good horror film, nothing special, apart from the fact that it breathed new life into one of the most stale franchises out there, and thats saying something.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

The difficulty is that fans of the Halloween series disliked this entry in the franchise. The reason is very simple, they picked in on Halloween 2 so what they decided was that you had to forget that Halloween 3,4,5 and 6 were ever made. Why they did it was very simple, Laurie Strode was dead in the other parts and it was the next of kin that got involved in Myers obsession. But to celebrate the event of 20 years the producer tracked down John Carpenter to get involved again, he agreed on some parts but wasn't at the last second going to direct, he offered Steve Miner instead.To pick in on the end of Halloween 2 you needed Laurie Strode or in other words, Jamie Lee Curtis. Jamie was low profile back then and she agreed immediately to be involved. But they really wanted to to make it an ode to the original so they asked Nancy Stephens, the assistant of Dr. Loomis to get involved too. She agreed, although of being harassed by Michael in part 2 somehow she survived and appeared in H2O. But they went further, they also wanted to cameo the mother of Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh (Psycho shower scene). She also agreed and if you look closely you can see her stepping towards a car. It's her car used in Psycho. The hype of Halloween was made due Scream were Ghostface asked a lot of questions concerning Halloween. So here in H2O they showed a piece of Scream on the television. So far so good, but as John Carpenter says, to make a good movie you need 3 things, a good script, a good script and a good script. And here it took a while before the flick really starts off. You have to wait almost an hour before Myers attacks. There is a lot of suspense and I must say that Chris Durand as The Shape did an excellent job. The directing was good too but if you place it in his year of release then you can see that it was low on blood and gore. Don't get me wrong, the original hadn't got a drip of blood and still it worked but with Scream and I Know going on it was back to the slashers with a lot of red stuff. It's like they wanted to make a flick like The Faculty or even Scream, you know, youngsters being killed random, with a well known face for a killer.

34,Smells_Like_Cheese,Back to the basics,8,24 November 2003,"This is the sequel we have been waiting for! After a little slump with Halloween 5, I think a lot of Halloween fans were worried that the Halloween franchise was going to be like the typical Friday the 13th series, that as the sequels went on the stories would just get worse and worse. Why is Halloween H20 different and better than the other sequels? Because they went back into their roots, most sequels loose touch with what the original movie was trying to produce and get into goofy characters. This movie delivers in perfect scares, the story is awesome, and we have Jamie Lee Curtis back! What more could we ask for? I do have to admit that there was a disappointment that they killed the original nurse from the first Halloween movie, but the way Michael did it was classic. This is my favorite Halloween sequel because Michael is back and he's scarier than ever. We have some new great actors like Josh Hartnett, Michelle Williams and even LLCoolJ was fun to have around, they were all great additions to our Halloween story.The movie features the return of Laurie Strode, now revealed to be living under the assumed name ""Keri Tate"". As Tate, Laurie has a seemingly perfect life with an intelligent son and a boyfriend, a great career; however, Laurie is far from happy. The tragic events from 20 years previous still haunt her mind, and strongly take effect on her parental capabilities. To everyone, this is ""just another Halloween,"" however Laurie still lives in constant fear. But this year is different. Marion Chambers and her neighbors are murdered by Michael after he steals a file on Laurie Strode. Michael leaves to find Laurie. To mark the 20th anniversary of the happenings of 1978, her brother, Michael Myers, appears, and starts killing off her co-workers and students one by one. And for the first time in two decades, they meet again. Laurie escapes, but chooses to go back to the school to challenge Michael in a fight to the death. She finds him and attempts killing him several times. But after all, this is Michael Myers, after several sequels you know it isn't going to be that easy.Halloween H20 is a great sequel that is sure to give you good scares, laughs, and it keeps you interested. This is one of those rare movies that made me cover my eyes in terror, I know it sounds a little cheesy, but when Laurie is having a bad flash of Michael coming towards her and she keeps trying to close her eyes and say it's just a dream, but she opens them and he's still walking towards her, yikes! Also I absolutely LOVED the ending, this was a great closure to the series, even though sadly they created another sequel, I just have to forget about that one because this is the way they should just leave the Halloween franchise. So not only would I recommend this movie if you were looking to complete the Halloween series, but just watch it in general, this movie goes back to the basics and is just a great movie. It was a lot of fun to watch and see Michael terrorizing the new cast, even after 20 years he's still got the touch to even make us sympathize with him, ooooo, Michael, where will you take us next?

She reprises the role of Laurie Stroud, 20 years after Michael Myer's supposed death, having moved far away and changed her identity, trying to deal with her past demons (not too successfully either.) At the very least she's become a very over-protective mother to her 17 year old son (as it turns out, for a good reason!)

Thanks, but I have a further suggestion: remove parts 2-6 and 8 from the shelves as the entire Michael Myers saga should have been composed of JUST Part 1 and 'H20.' Despite its flaws, such as an overlong, though entertaining refresher to the previous installments, opening and why they always leave the mask on after he's ""supposedly"" dead, 'H20' was seriously a very well made film. It was exciting, funny, perfectly paced and sometimes scary movie involving characters that actually, and finally, had depth. Thanks Jamie Lee for returning. Thanks to then-newcomer Josh Hartnett, who I never liked since yet did a very good job here. And thanks to the producers who believed there still was a strong story behind the mask, something sorely lacking in previous 5 sequels. We last left Michael Myers burning in the hospital in Haddonfield (remember, the whole niece story was scrapped in this storyline, thankfully) 20 years earlier, but that hasn't stopped Laurie, who faked her death and fled to California, bringing deep psychological problems. But now she has a rebellious (with a cause) son (the same age as when she was attacked in #1-2) to deal with in addition to booze and of course, the true return of her brother Michael Myers. So much worked in this movie. Such as: they don't dwell on the killing of other nobodies, once he's back, they quickly get to the reunion of killer brother and survivor sister. Also, the lines/acting by Curtis were great, especially mom/daughter scream queens (listen for the 'Psycho' music!) And a perfect ending. For all true fans of the original series, only watch 1 and H20.Side Note: Aside from the 'Season of the Witch's mess, this is the only 'Halloween' that happens entirely outside of Haddonfield, Ill and without Dr. Sam Loomis. Thank you. Seriously, as a lifelong fan of the Myers's saga, and yet, being severely kicked in the, well, gut, by parts 4-6 (ESPECIALLY #6), I thank you. Not entirely to compare this to the masterpiece 'Jaws,' but I loved the fact this was the first one NOT about Michael that had the character Michael (again, forgetting Part III's 'Season.') It's about Laurie and what she's gone through since, her deep problems she's attempted to deal with and move on. It's about vengeance, anger, closure. Sure, one could look at this without so much depth, but I've just recently watched all 7 (up to this point, I still have #8 and one Rob Zombie movie to go) in preparation for Rob Zombie's 'Halloween II' coming August 28th, and let me tell you: this was a welcome installment. Like most series, they seemed to get progressively worse once that niece story began in #4. And by #6, my stomach hurt – seriously, it was so bad, I felt sick. I am glad to see Jamie Lee coming back to finish her storyline, much like Heather Langenkamp did for 'Wes Craven's New Nightmare.' In conclusion, coming from someone who just sat through the first 7 original movies, listen to me when I say: Watch #1, then skip to 'H20.' Forget the rest of the original series. Just have the knowledge that #2 ended with Michael Myers burning – that's all you need to know from that one, don't waste your time.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
39,gridoon,Pretty damn awful!,4,29 October 2000,"One of the worst of the many slasher films made recently, and a poor addition to the enduring ""Halloween"" series. Director Miner doesn't seem to possess even the elementary skills that are needed for a good horror movie; his tactics are unbelievably primitive and his insistence on ""false scares"" becomes ludicrous after a while. John Carpenter's famous creepy music score is barely used; what we get instead are stupid musical cues every time a friendly character ""unintentionally"" scares someone else who then says ""Don't ever do that again!"". The first hour of the movie, extremely low on gore and genuine scares, is practically useless; it plays like a third-rate TV drama. In the final 15 minutes, the pace finally picks up, with a gruesome murder and a fairly well-shot chase scene, but by then it's too late. Overall, a highly overpraised film that could be mistaken for a Disney production if one or two gory sequences were trimmed. (*1/2)",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
40,ericstevenson,The rating should be higher!,8,27 October 2017,"I personally found this to be the best ""Halloween"" movie after the original. The tension is built up very well in this film. This made the right decision of ignoring all the other Halloween movies except for the first two. Sadly, Donald Pleasance died before he could work on this movie and honestly, it probably worked better without the Dr. Loomis character. I guess it's now said that Loomis died in the fire at the end of ""Halloween II"". This movie probably deserves credit for not being too violent and it doesn't just rely on gore. I will admit that it does drag on in the middle.Still, these scenes can work because they show the more realistic aspects of the franchise. You get a fight at the climax that built up well and it isn't drawn out too much. Of course, with a film that's only 85 minutes long, it doesn't have that much plot. Some of the jump scares do get repetitive, but what matters is that we have a great actress like Jamie Lee Curtis in this film. A pity Joseph Gordon-Levitt had to die so early in this movie. He's a great actor! ***",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

It has NOTHING to do with the last 5 Halloween movies and is NOT scary or frightening or worth any attention.Well, maybe that's a lie. Michelle Williams is worth attention and is the only reason for watching this piece of c**p. But it's not like she's in it much. The film is only 84 minutes long and has about 5 scenes. I don't even consider this to be an official Halloween movie. It was only made to cash in on the 'Scream' craze of teenagers being staked by a masked killer. Seeing as how Halloween was the very first Slasher flick I guess Miramax thought that this would be the Zenith of the craze. How wrong they were.All deaths are pointless and meaningless and Jamie-Lee's attempt at being a Ripley-like chick with balls doesn't work. Plain and simple.File this movie under bad.

44,Bored_Dragon,By far the best in the original franchise,7,12 April 2019,"When I sat down to watch ""H2O"" I was expecting ""same crap, different package,"" because that's what I got from the previous six. But the film did not meet my expectations - the packaging is much better than before. Much more expensive production, much better story and atmosphere, more famous actors, and Jamie Lee Curtis, who in her forties looks and acts better than in her girlhood.The authors wisely decided to ignore the previous sequels and refer directly to the original story. In the film, I did not notice stupid illogicalities typical of this genre, which pleasantly surprised me. The movie lasts less than an hour and a half, there is no idling and humdrum, and in the second part, it was actively holding me on the edge of the chair, which none of its prequels managed to accomplish.I especially liked that the film is full of references to Hitchcock's ""Psycho."" Jamie Lee Curtis plays the director of a private high school, and her secretary is Janet Leigh, her mother, famous for playing Marion in ""Psycho."" In the scene when Janet leaves the school, she stands in front of a car from ""Psycho"", and the background music is also from this classic. The registration plate is the same as in ""Psycho"" and represents the initials of Norman Bates. In one scene, friend says to Jamie's son: ""Twenty years from now, you'll still be living with her, probably running some weird motel, out in the middle of nowhere."" Sounds familiar?The simple and effective story, well-balanced pace and duration, great atmosphere and, of course, the legendary tune that makes us shiver for decades.

45,ironhorse_iv,"I don't care if I get in hot water for this, but I thought Halloween H20 was stagnant. The film wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer. It was kinda dull. Mediocre at best.",5,31 October 2019,"First off, I really hate the silly gimmicky confusing title. The movie directed by Steve Miner sounds like something that Aquafina would put out during the fall season. It's not scary. The title doesn't even roll off the tongue. It's very wordy. Second off, the film itself is somewhat polarizing as it ignore the continuity of the previous last three films of the Halloween franchise. So if you were a fan of the Curse of Thorn storyline. You might not be happy. Those events are not really considered canon anymore. However, in executive producer Kevin Williamson's treatment of the film, those events would had been acknowledged in certain scenes involving a classroom report here. Nevertheless, they were cut from the final version. Yet, bits of that's treatment are still in the movie with newspaper clippings and a photo of bloody scissors in the opening scene. Sadly, the filmmakers didn't replace those themes with much of anything new. Although it's the only film in the series not to take place in Haddonfield, IL. The film about Michael Myers (Chris Durand) finding Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) in hiding as a headmistress of an California boarding school felt like a typical slasher film with all style with no substance. It's sad because I like original creator John Carpenter's idea of having Myers being more of a ghost. It would explain, the off screen teleportation in which, the boogeyman can suddenly appear in front of their intended victims despite said victims clearly being able to outrun them. Also the psychological approach of Strode getting haunted by spirits would add something unique. It would make her struggle with trauma and alcoholism seem more compelling. Yet, this concept was rejected by the producers in favor of a multiply copycat killers 1996's 'Scream' angle. Nevertheless that idea was also cut from the final product, leaving jarring plot holes like the killer's lack of burns and good eyesight. Despite that, Durand does do a good job capturing the mannerism of the shape very well. I just wish, the eyes holes of all the masks they use, weren't so big. It's so bad that you can see the actor's bright pupils in certain moments. It humanize the monster who supposed to have the blackest of eyes. Aside from the many jarring different looking masks & the poorly done CGI one, the film needed more intense suspense. The voyeurism POV perspectives from the first movie was greatly miss. Because of that, the movie's visuals didn't felt that creepy. It need more unmounted camera work to keep us unsettled, off balance, and vulnerable to shock rather than cheap jump scares with loud sudden noised. Without it, the film get boring and drawn out between the bloody kills. The movie tries to fit in some comedy with LL Cool J's idiotic character of Ronnie, but the jokes with him don't really landed for me. As for sex appeal. Since the movie doesn't really have nudity. The misogyny & misandry toward sex is not as noticeable as the other movies. However, some of the teens like Charlie (Adam Hann Byrd) & Sarah (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) are bit unlikeable cartoony horny for normal people. Not the best acting from them. As for Josh Hartnett as Laurie's son, John. His poor delivery of lines was mostly flat. While he was indeed nineteen at the time. He didn't look like one. His adult like presence playing a kid was also a bit jarring. His underdeveloped character along with Michelle William's Molly don't really add much to the film. I felt that the filmmakers could had explore John's unseen estranged dad, a little more as well. As for cameos. Joseph Gordon Levitt & Nancy Stephens were nice to see. However, it's Curtis's real life mother Janet Leigh that steal the show. Seeing her mention the shower is clogged and getting in a car that is similar to one she drove in 1960 film 'Psycho', with a piece of film's score playing in the background was memorable. Thank goodness, they got her, instead of PJ Soles from 1979 'Halloween'. Seeing her again in the same franchise would be too weird. I just wish the film didn't repetitive ham fisted the audience with exposition about the original Haddonfield murders, a billion times. Those dialogue callbacks from Curtis really got annoying with the redundancy. Nevertheless, it was nice to see Curtis back in the role. Still, it wasn't as bizarre as the jarring out of place recycled music cues from Marco Beltrami's soundtrack for 'Scream' and ""Mister Sandman"" from 1981 'Halloween 2' played over of the majority of the film rather than the iconic theme from Carpenter. I don't get that, if they want to focus so much on the original, why not have that memorable score play. Regardless it was nice to hear a triumphant sounding version of the theme plays in closely minutes even if they largely scrapped composer John Ottman's score in favor of it. The final conflict ending between Laurie and Myers was indeed really good. However, it doesn't make up for the lack of thrills during the majority of the movie's 86 minute runtime. In the end, while this film was written and intended to be the final chapter in Halloween Saga. Executive meddling from the studios prevented that & in 2002, the film 'Halloween: Resurrection' was released; kinda killing the nice conclusion. Nevertheless, 2018's 'Halloween' retconned the whole series. Because of that, this movie written by Robert Zappia & Matt Greenberg doesn't have much rewatch value. It's pretty pointless to check out unless you want to know where 2018 film got the public bathroom scene idea from. Overall: While truly better than most of the Halloween series sequels. I still found this dated watered down film to be dead in the water. One not worth revisiting.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

49,zkonedog,"Ahead Of Its Time, But Still Terrible",2,11 March 2017,"Once the new millennium dawned, many films (Rocky, Rambo, Lord of the Rings, Batman, etc.) went the ""homage"" route to their predecessors, while also establishing a new sense of continuity in the process. ""Halloween H2O"" beat them to the punch by a few years, but ultimately ended up being a complete flop.For a basic plot summary, ""H2O"" sees Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) living in California after having faked her death to escape the wrath of Michael Myers. When Laurie's son John (Josh Hartnett) turns 17, the same age Laurie was when attacked in 1978, Myers is again ""activated"" to seek out the Strode family and destroy it.The one good thing I can say about this movie is that it tried. It really did. It tried to put a more fitting conclusion to the Halloween saga after pretty much relegating the events of sequels 3-6 to non-cannon material. However, the writing/directing/producing failed miserably in the task.For starters, this is perhaps the most predictable film I have ever viewed in my life. Viewers know that Myers will come back (otherwise why even make the movie?) to torment Laurie, so the first hour of character-development is rendered moot because you already know what will happen. It doesn't help that the supporting cast is so bland as to make you not care one way or another when they get knocked off.Also, much like Anthony Perkins' performance in the later ""Psycho"" movies, I don't quite know what to make of Jamie Lee Curtis here. On one hand, she seems to be paying tribute (with a decent effort) to the franchise that gave her an acting career. On the other, though, it sort of reeks of desperation that she's doing the sixth Halloween sequel.Thus, it pretty much boggles my mind to think that writers Debra Hill and John Carpenter (the masters of the original) would phone in such an uninspired effort. I would like to think that a better story, with more heart and suspense, could have been told. Perhaps, though, there was just nothing creatively left from a franchise chugging along on one week of the year's profits...the week leading up to October 31.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
50,johnnyboyz,Ballistic: Myers vs. Strode.,5,19 May 2008,"Halloween H20 starts off with a young boy going into a big, creepy house on Halloween after a break in has occurred. The first thing is that if a house has been broken into, you wouldn't go into the crime scene touching everything up and removing items from the area. Secondly, the scene just doesn't work for me personally. It's a horror film, we know; its subgenre is of the 'slasher' variety, we know because it bears the brand name 'Halloween' in its title. So when the opening of a 'Halloween' picture has a young boy go into a dark and 'burgled' house on Halloween night, it feels as if we are given more of the same, more of the same.Unfortunately, the film begins with the same manner in which it retains throughout: members of the human species whom are of a young age going into places they shouldn't. This will happen to a few people throughout the duration of the film, most of whom will be on the wrong end of Michael Myers' knife. But a scrape of credit is due for the director Steve Miner because he has taken a formula that, by Halloween 6, was becoming so familiar that distributors could probably have gotten away with tampering with previous instalments a little, before shipping them to multiplexes. I doubt if too many audiences would have noticed. Here, the idea of a haunted house or the Haddonfield streets or a hospital (alá Halloween II) is scrapped for a private school set away from most of society; the private school comes complete with the sorts of students you wouldn't expect to see at a private school, which is a little odd.And it is here that Laurie Strode (Lee Curtis) has assumed the identity of a headmistress, under a different name for her own protection of course. I find it interesting that Strode has become a headmistress  a position of power, a position that relies on the superego inside of you and perhaps this has something to do with the events in her life that she suffered so horrifically to throughout her own childhood-early adult years. Now she is in general control of a group of people that, when she was their age, have their lives ahead of them. It is almost as if she is so desperate that nobody goes through what she suffered that she takes it on herself to control and make sure a large group of young adults grow up without tragedy.But the situation revolving around Myers is so bad that even her own son does not know about it. Josh Hartnett plays her son John in a debut role; in a film that pastiches an earlier iconic horror film. But I preferred his other 1998 horror film The Faculty which itself was also a sort of pastiche, only one of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. John is like most teenagers but not the sort you'd expect at a public school; the major drag is that the film gives us the obligatory scenes in which John is told not to do something so naturally, he does it much to his mother's distress  if only he knew. Although director Miner does express he knows what he's doing. He incorporates ideas of Freud in his film but they do at times feel as if they are living off previously successful efforts; namely Hitchcock's Psycho. John mentions his mother's smothering and there is a line of dialogue to one of his buddies that 'she should just learn to let me go'. Then his buddy mentions Psycho itself and the permeations revolving around Norman Bates and his mother begin to creep in. Miner isn't finished there, though because he even casts Janet Leigh in what can only be read as either a pointless cameo or as a further reference to Freud, Psycho and the ideas about Laurie's superego attitude toward the young adults of this generation - 20 years after her own terrible young adult years.Although the ideas are not concrete or developed, they are merely included. Maybe Miner's favourite film is Psycho, maybe he just knows the theory and wishes to throw it in for good measure. Then the film has its issues with black character Ronny Jones (LL Cool J) and how he comes dangerously close to being the mere comic relief for the film, describing in detail passages from his book to his wife or girlfriend  we must listen in on their very private conversations as their sexual desires are spilt to the rest of us. But it is 'slasher' that the film falls into and it is slasher we get for most of the runtime. A kid puts his hands in a sink plug blender; a girl is caught out in a kitchen pulley transport system and there are some chase scenes around the private school grounds towards the end. Although while the scenes are somewhat entertaining, they do not match the bizarreness of the final showdown between Myers and Strode that goes on and on and that gets to its position in a somewhat rushed manner.Halloween H2O may not be a great or even a particularly good horror film but it does its job in pacing and atmosphere. It's violent enough to recommend but the narrative and some of the scenes, particularly early on when they revolve around people who we know are pure Myers cannon fodder, are a little anticlimactic and pointless. But with the immediate ending that we get, you'd assume there wouldn't be any more sequels  how incorrect we probably all were.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

I recall that it made it's debut in number 3 at the box office. Expectations were high towards it and I might say, that the movie delivered. This isn't by any means as good as the original or the worthy sequels ""Halloween II"" and ""The Return Of Michael Myers"". ""Halloween H20"" hits in the nail and brings favorite Jamie Lee Curtis to reprise her role as Laurie Stroed. And in one of the most emotional moments in the series, the movie opens with footage of Donald's Pleasence voice, while doing a commentary about Myers. I'm sure that Mr. Pleasence would be proud of this movie as it's on his honor. Sadly, he is not present in body to confrontate Myers for one last time. The movie's plot is easy but it's what we, the fans wanted. Bring back Myers to take revenge against his sister. That's it. The sub-plot of her new identity and the fear for her son's safety is just irrelevant but still delivers. The events that lead to the movie's chilling ending are just pointless but some of them deserve some merit. The death scenes in the movie are pretty good. Old Halloween style. I truly enjoyed most of them. There's no need of a lot of gore when you have a creative mind. The new characters are really likable and you can't help but feel sorry for them. Ronnie, played by rapper LL Cool J started the whole new wave of rappers in Horror. He didn't do a bad job but it's really weird to see him in a Halloween flick. Josh Hartnett made a great debut in the industry with this movie. The guy is talented. Michelle Williams also did a decent job although her past in ""Dawson's Creek"" was not well accepted by hard core fans. But, if many actors/actresses did Friday the 13h movies after being in ""Falcon's Crest"", why shouldn't Michelle? She was very cute and talented. But this is all about Jamie Lee Curtis' performance. She is solid, strong, and believable. She'll always be the number one scream queen. In this movie she faces and defeats Myers. What a great comeback. The ending, for it's time was pretty cool. I loved it. That was a perfect ending for a popular Horror franchise. Sadly, four years later a horrible sequel would ruin it. Anyways, this is a worthy sequel and probably one of the most decent slashers from the late 90's. Even better than ""Scream"" just because it has Michael Myers.

This was a most excellent and deserving sequel to what had become a tired franchise, and is my favorite of the line. It gets a 9/10 from...the Fiend :.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
58,Captain_Couth,"Lame sequel, should have never been made.",2,16 June 2004,"Halloween H20 (1998) should have never been made. Thanks to this movie the last three sequels have been rendered impotent (But I still regard them as official and this film as utter tripe). I have no love for this movie.  There is no reason why this movie was released or even produced.  It was obvious the filmmakers were trying to make a few bucks off the Scream franchise (another worthless franchise).  The storyline in this one branches off from part two.  Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her seminal scream queen role as the surviving babysitter from the first film.  Despite the fact her character was eliminated  from the storyline in part four, she's back.  Michael Myers is back as well (how old is he any way?) to tie up some loose ends (we have been down this path before folks haven't we?).  He uses his supernatural homing pigeon skills to find Jamie Lee and wants to snuff her lights out for good.This film is not very good.  It's filled with cheap thrills, lame situations and contrived writing.   Sadly,  Like all movies made during this time period and dealing with this genre it tries too hard.  Yes, this film tries too hard to be funny, tries too hard to be scary and tries too hard to be innovative.  Don't waste your time.Not recommended.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
59,Polaris_DiB,"Return to form, thankfully",7,6 May 2007,"Well, what a surprise... I actually LIKED this one. Director Steve Minor takes cues from the first film and returns ""Halloween"" to its roots, in the process creating a much better flowing and entertaining movie than any of the situations that occurred 3-6. Also, this movie sets a precedent by introducing actually realistic characters (not all, but most of them) that aren't entirely stupid and that--*GASP!*--you care about whether they die or not! This results in a more tightly structured thriller that actually entertains, rather than merely leading cattle to slaughter. And if you're the type to pay attention to such things, this is probably the reason why this movie has about half the deaths of any of the films since the first one. It doesn't need killings to scare, it already has a gripping storyline.So here it is: 20 years after Michael's first spree, Laurie Strode has a 17 year old son, has changed her name, and is living in California working as principal of a private school. She's still traumatized by her past, which causes her to be overbearing to her son and iffy with her relationship with the school guidance counselor. But it's when Laurie realizes that her son is the same age she was when she was attacked (and her sister was when her sister was attacked) that she starts becoming paranoid about the chances of it starting again. Enter Michael.This movie is a lot more witty than I think people give credit to. For one thing, the pop psychobabble that speckles the dialog is often used ironically, and for those who pay attention to the difference between what people say and what people mean, the dialog is actually kind of witty. Halloween: H20 is about facing your fears, and it's nice to see Laurie Strode stalk Michael for once. Plus, the filmmakers return to the original aspect ratio and a lot of the original set up, and work at making this more a mood piece than a direct slasher... in other words, like the first and second features, not like their forgettable sequels.Halloween: H20 finally resolves the franchise as it started, meaning that Halloween 1, 2, and H20 make a nice little trilogy. In the opening credits, it acknowledges that the other movies were there, but it pretty much drops the topics and events they introduced (and good thing, too, as the franchise was getting more and more out of control) and goes back to making a horror movie with some actual tension and psychology.The series quite obviously should have ended here. One more bad sequel follows, and now the first movie is being remade by Rob Zombie. Hopefully the rethinking of the series will lead to more sequels like this one instead of the vomit that was Halloweens 3 through 6.--PolarisDiB",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
60,Stevieboy666,Should have been a fitting end to the story...,7,13 October 2018,"It's pretty hard for me to believe that I was sat in the cinema watching this 20 years ago - and even harder to believe that that was the 20th anniversary of the original. Part 3, much as I like it, really is not part of the series. We can also skip parts 4-6, this one is a follow up to the events of the first - and best - 2 movies. 
Jamie Leigh Curtis is back, as good as ever, for a final showdown with brother Michael. And that should've wrapped the series up but sadly somebody came up with the idea of Resurrection.
Needless to say H2O is not a patch on Carpenter's masterpiece, however it is a decent slasher, released at a time when the likes of Scream, IKWYDLS, Urban Legend etc were filling out cinemas. And it sits nicely with the best of those. The pace is quite fast, there's are plenty of deaths & some good moments of suspense. The nod to Psycho with Jamie's real life mum Janet making an appearance was really nice. For me this is the third best movie in the series, with a new Halloween film released next week it will be interesting to see if that changes.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

H20 is so well made & so well acted especially by Jamie lee curtis who gives one of the best performances of her career in my opinion as the older & more troubled Laurie strode.
The music is Fantastic,a nice new score mixed wuth carpenters classic theme & the cinematography is really gorgeous & slick looking a real Thriller look. Josh Hartnett is great in this film as Laurie's fed up troubled son John.
Now i love Halloween '78 of course it's a classic & a John Carpenter favourite but my personal favourite ""Michael Myers"" film is the 1998 ""H20"" i just loved the setting & atmosphere & the characters/cast all were good choices & good fun such as the romantic nice guy security guard played by LL Cool J he's great fun.I gotta say again how much i love Jamie lee Curtis, she's a fantastic actor & one i grew up watching & loving from young as five always watched her on video in films such as ""Trading Places"" & ""Halloween 1&2"" & ""The Fog"" & ""Blue Steel"" & ""True Lies"" & ""Virus"" Among a few other's so she has always been a big part of my childhood & movie world!!!""H20"" is one of my favourite Slasher/ Thrillers of all time & i consider ""H20"" to be one of the best from the 90's along with ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" & ""Scream 1&2"" but ""H20"" is the best because i grew up watching the whole Halloween franchise & love Jamie lee curtis as Laurie Strode.Halloween H20 is a smart,stylish, exciting & fun so 90's Slasher Thriller with an incredible performance from the great JAMIE LEE CURTIS!!!",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
63,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Pretty damn good sequel,8,21 November 2015,"I have a soft spot for Halloween: H20, it's a good old Dimension produced slick flick that I've seen on TV in the AM hours enough times for it to really grow on me. Also, it makes an effort to do something different this time around,as opposed to the same old well worn formula that we're used to. Don't get me wrong, it's still a slasher flick, but it's more coherent and self aware than the previous the entries, who are somewhat guilty of sleepwalking on the coat tails of the original duo. The notable feature here is the return of Laurie Strode, Jamie Lee Curtis making a comeback in a very different, commanding turn as the character she started out as so many years before. It's nice to see her back, even if they did subvert their own running continuity to do so, but I guess horror franchises were never much about the logic side of things to begin with lol. Casting in general on this one is pretty cool. The nurse from the original first two flicks shows up in a delightfully eerie prologue alongside a super young Joseph Gordon Levitt, setting the stage for the horror to come. Laurie is now headmistress of a swanky private school in upstate NY, and severely, stiflingly overprotective of her son (Josh Hartnett in his film debut). Him and his friends, including Michelle Williams and Jodi Lyn O Keefe, are excluded fom a school camping trip and left behind to get up to shenanigans right around the time old Michael decides to make an epic return to visit Laurie, and mercilessly slaughter anyone who gets in his way. Adam Ark in and a really unnecessary, dumb ass LL Cool J get in the way and become knife food as well. Seeing Michael and Laurie reunite again is legendary, and had to happen eventually, this film being just the enjoyable entry to showcase that. PS: back to the stupid mask again.

64,drownnnsoda,Jamie Lee Curtis' Return Made This Movie.,8,5 July 2006,"It's common knowledge that every sequel to the Halloween series has never been quite as good as the original was, it's hard to beat it. This installment in the series is no exception, but there was one thing that made it stand out - Jamie Lee Curtis was back as Laurie Strode.Ms. Strode, who survived the terrifying encounter with her brother, Michael Myers, year earlier, is now the dean of a private school in Northern California, living under an assumed name in fear that her brother might find her again. She has a teenage son, John, and a boyfriend, Will, who is also an employee at the school. It's fall, and Halloween is nearing, which is always a hard time for Laurie, because of all the memories it brings back. The students at the school get off on a camping trip to Yosemite, but unbeknown to Laurie, her son John is planning his own Halloween party with a few friends while the school sits empty, and Michael seems to have returned. Now, with virtually everyone gone from the school, Laurie has to fight back to save everyone around her, before Michael finishes them off, before doing what he intended to do to Laurie 20 years ago.The opening scene to this movie was one of my favorite in the film, featuring the murder or Nurse Marion, who was the nurse at the psychiatric hospital in the original film who dealt with Michael. The rest of the movie was great, although I could've done without the score that they used in Wes Craven's ""Scream"". The original Halloween theme was seldom used in this movie, which was a bit disappointing, and instead during the chase scenes they used a song that I distinctly remember hearing in the ""Scream"" series. But besides that, I think this was probably the best sequel since part II.Bottom line is, every Halloween fan will enjoy this movie solely because of Laurie's return to the series, after 4 other sequels without her, she was the main ground for the series. 8/10.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

Yes, it is even better than the 1978 original. Jamie Lee Curtis really does a great job as Laurie Strode, who is now the principal of a posh California school, and is a recovering alcoholic and has been haunted with anxiety and nightmares ever since her first run in with Michael. I love all the actors in this movie, Jamie of course, but josh hartnett was good too, along with Michelle Williams and LL Cool J. The dialogue and script was also good here, not bland cheesy or cliché at all. The scares weren't like amazing, but they were not bad by any means, the scenes were plenty tense and on edge, as they should be. The beginning of this film was great too, it really kicks of to an exciting start, Joseph Gordon Levitt gets us off to a scary start. To be honest, the Halloween franchise just should have ended with H20, I mean come on even Jamie Lee Curtis herself said that resurrection was a joke, things would've been sooo much better if it all just would've ended here. This movie had an AWESOME ending! I loved the ending to H20, it was just what happened and what was discovered in the next movie that I HATED. I mean come on, this film would've been a perfect way for Michael Myers and Laurie strode to go out. Go out with a bang.

Which ""Halloween:H20"" is certainly better than most of the ""Halloween"" sequels (Although i did enjoyed ""Halloween 4:The Return of Michael Myers""). Director Miner certainly knows the rules of a slasher/horror movies. Since he directed the better ""Friday the 13th"" sequels (Part 2 & Part 3) and he also worked with Curtis before in ""Forever Young"". Curtis gives one of her best performances in her career returning to the role that made her famous (especially her old days as the ""Scream Queen"", she was certainly one of the originals). She originally wanted John Carpenter to directed this but he wisely walked away and let some other director handle the material. Since he was never comfortable with the sequels.DVD has an sharp non-anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The Canadian DVD says it's enchanted for 16x9 televisions but it is not true, since it is the same transfer from the 1998 DVD. But it is at least, one of the better non-anamorphic transfer from that time. DVD also included an featurette, music video and an amusing trivia game (Which it should been more complicated). I would have loved to hear an running commentary track by director Miner and actress:Curtis but sadly, we didn't. There's no deleted scenes as well, since some television versions added some additional footage. The cast are good here including Michelle Williams as John's girlfriend, LL Cool J, Jodi Lyn D'Keefe and Adam Hann Byrd. There's also cameos by Janet Leigh in a good scene with Curtis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the opening sequence.""Halloween:H20"" was a surprise box office hit. Many critics enjoyed Curtis' performance, which it is one of the reasons why ""Halloween:H20"" is worth watching. But the screenplay by Robert Zappia and Matt Greenberg (The Prophecy 2, 1408, Reign of Fire) has some major problems. The seventh film of the series suffers a bit too much from false scares and humour (Certainly from the LL Cool J character, i liked this actor/rapper but his role as the security guard/wannabe cheesy romantic writer seems out of place with the film). Also one of the problems, i felt it was too short. The screenplay should have been more complex. But it has enough thrills, suspense and excitement to make it better than it is. Overall ""Halloween:H20"" is truly a good sequel that should have ended there. Although i enjoyed ""Halloween:Resurrection"" on a guilty pleasure level. I felt the final scene between Laurie and Michael to be oddly intriguing, especially it nearly humanized Michael. This is certainly one of the most underrated sequels of all time, this is worth re-discovering since it's been 10 years from its release. Kevin Williamson, the then hot-screenwriter of ""Scream"" and ""I'll Know What You Did Last Summer"" did some re-writes in the screenplay. Which he's only credited as one of the co-executive producers. Super 35. (****/*****).",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
67,JoeKarlosi,Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later (1998) ***,7,28 October 2012,"I don't usually approve of sequels that disregard other entries in its own series, but this one was welcome. It was a smart return to form after dealing with all sorts of alternating story lines in past sequels. For this one, lead actress Jamie Lee Curtis went on record as saying she wished to give something back to the fans for the 20th anniversary of the first HALLOWEEN, and to find some kind of closure for her Laurie Strode character. It was decided that parts 3 through 6 would be ignored, and that HALLOWEEN H20 would instead take up from where HALLOWEEN 2 left off, as though the other entries had never existed. So in this one we have grown single mom Laurie Strode still mentally suffering from the memory of the horrors she endured that fearful Halloween night when she was just 17. She has taken on a position as the headmistress of a school, changed her name and faked her own death to avoid an encounter with her murderous brother, Michael Myers, who still torments her memory. But this Halloween her teenage son John also turns the same age as she was when the masked madman stalked her two decades ago... It's refreshing to have Curtis back in the storyline, with the idea of having Laurie struggling with her own personal ""Frankenstein Monster"" demon that she constantly tries to contain. The climax at the last 30 minutes or so is well worth the wait, with Laurie gaining back her confidence. And the ending (which will not be revealed) was an excellent way to bring complete satisfaction and a fitting end to the first Trilogy. *** out of ****",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
68,aidanratesmovies,"Solid follow-up, but far from the best",7,6 July 2021,"Entertaining but lacking any depth- Halloween H20 is a fairly decent sequel- but hardly compares to the quality or fright of the original. By far the biggest issue with this film is the plot, if that is what you can call it. The plot is so thin and full of filler that you can truly tell it is only being used to gain runtime and be used as a vehicle to carry along the film to where the action will take place. It's a heavy burden to weigh upon the film, and the fact that the mask looks like something someone bought at Walmart isn't any better either- seriously, it's quite ridiculous to look at. That being said, in terms of acting, this is the best job they had done so far. Jamie Lee Curtis is the obvious standout in the film, and to be honest, without her, the film would just completely fall apart. She's the heart and soul of this film, and her performance is so dedicated and thought-through that you can't help but admire the decision to bring back her character. All the other actors do a fine job, some better than others (why is LL Cool J in this film?). The film isn't very scary, but the kills are a fun kind of brutal nevertheless- and it isn't choppy or feel forced like the last few films. In the end, Halloween H20 is a thinly written film with just enough star power and entertainment value to make it worth the ride. It's far from perfect, but for the time, it's the best Myers sequel so far.My Rating: 6.7/10.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
69,Jonny_Numb,"Forget ""Resurrection""--the series ends here.",6,9 September 2006,"Back before Lions Gate (now Lionsgate) held the monopoly on mainstream genre pics, Dimension Films was the go-to place for horror and suspense of the 'indie' sort. In 1998, with Wes Craven's 2 ""Scream"" films maintaining the public interest to great financial success, Dimension decided to put their acquisition of the ""Halloween"" franchise to good use (especially after the atrocious ""Curse of Michael Myers"") by making a sequel to end all sequels (at least until the atrocious ""Halloween: Resurrection"" turded up multiplexes).In addition to being one of the most instantly-recognizable titles in all of horror, ""Halloween: H20"" came to screens with an added incentive: it marked the series return of original protagonist/victim Laurie Strode (played with cat-like veracity by Jamie Lee Curtis). Curtis' presence, in addition to the reliable skill of director Steve Miner (who cut his teeth on two ""Friday the 13th"" sequels), plus a story that wisely disregarded the incidents of all the sequels past ""II,"" set ""H20"" up as the series payoff I was so eagerly awaiting. After leaving the theater, I was more than satisfied with the end result.Years go by. Dimension becomes a notorious den of re-cuts, re-shoots, and re-castings (just ask Wes ""Cursed"" Craven) still trying to mine the 'Fresh-Faced-Teen' demographic that doesn't seem to exist anymore. Upon re-examination of ""H20""'s box/poster art, I noticed a recurrent motif (from ""Scream"" to ""Phantoms"" to ""Nightwatch"" to ""Rounders"") in design: the proliferation of airbrushed faces looking Deeply Concerned about something, in addition to an over-reliance on bold, exclamatory blurbs from dubious sources (WWOR-TV, anyone?).But I'm not reviewing the marketing tactics of a company whose former glories (namely Tarantino and Rodriguez) are now its only source of revenue.""Sin City"" notwithstanding, ""H20"" might have been the last good movie to come out of Dimension. At its core, it is a surprisingly compact (86 minutes, including credits) horror-thriller that moves so briskly we are never able to get too cozy with the characters. Miner goes for the subtle compositions that marked John Carpenter's original, and is fairly successful: the film refrains from the obligatory sex and self-referential attitude that would have been profitable at the time. From frame one, ""H20"" feels like a continuous, flowing set-piece...but the way it sidelines its characters leaves a hollow echo when it's all finished. Also unfortunate is that the suspense is so heavy-handed it seldom creates tension; this might be attributable to Chris Durand's overly self-conscious portrayal of the menacing Michael Myers. The relationship between Curtis, her son John (Josh Hartnett), and Myers is the film's intriguing familial triangle, but is disappointingly underdeveloped (though for the sake of the series, it wraps things up well enough).In the end, ""H20"" is Curtis' show. She imbues her character with as much straight-faced commitment as she did in '78, in addition to a toughened exterior bent on preserving family values at any cost. The denouement, which contains a moment as touching as it is creepy, gives new meaning to the phrase, ""tough love.""",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

Though I admit ""Halloween VI: The Curse of Michael Myers"" was probably the worst of the series so far, I was eagerly looking forward to watching this entry, primarily because the series had started to slump into a rut. As much as I liked some of the psychic connections Michael developed with his niece in ""Halloween V: The Revenge of Michael Myers"", the series also started to feel as if it had jumped the shark just a bit.This film feels far more like a return to the original roots: it's just a masked killer vs a group of scared people, and honestly, it's a blast! There are plenty of references to the original films, but Michael himself looses any of the supernatural powers he had previously possessed (aside from being nigh impossible to kill), and Jamie Lloyd (Laurie's daughter with the psychic link to Michael) doesn't exist in this universe.

In 2002 they decided to make an unnecessary sequel that totally ruined the best horror finale.This is the first Halloween since the first sequel in 1981 that involved Laurie Strode (Curtis). Some did not like that since it ignored most of the sequels. I actually liked the Laurie storyline more, so I was happy with this. Laurie was one of the first female heroes that really made Halloween. 20 years after the first events, Laurie has faked her death and now works as a headmaster at a private school. Her knowledge of the 20 anniversary has her anticipating the return of Michael Myers. This time, Laurie will be prepared to end it all. When I say that she will end it all, I mean she will. That is what really makes this movie so good. The 20th anniversary of one of the scariest horror franchises ends with the killer being killed by his greatest victim. They could not have ended the series in a better way. Jamie Lee Curtis's return as Laurie is also the best serious role we have seen her as. Other actors such as Josh Harnett and LL Cool J did well too. My only criticism would have to be the body count. I don't mind leaving all the good stuff till the end, but there could have been as few more death scenes here and there earlier on. Other than that, this really was great.

Kevin Williamson even has some kind of co-assistant-producer credit. I don't really think the script is that good, so beats me why Jamie Lee Curtis was keen on returning, but she's there, good. One thing I don't get though, if we're supposed to assume that part 4 never happened, shouldn't we get another explanation to why Michael is still alive after being blown up? We actually saw his corpse burning through the credits of that second one. I did really like how his without a doubt massive burn wounds had completely disappeared when he revealed himself in part 5, but we're drifting off. This sequel really isn't bad, the action is decent, but it's pretty toothless and has a very low body count. That's not the most important thing in every horror movie, but it is when it has little else going for it. They did wrap it up in a cool way, but yet another sequel ruined that.

No, Michael Myers is not killing people with water, it's just 20 years later. After looking at the lineup of films in this series, this one can go down as one of the better efforts. The film starts off with the killing of the kid from 3rd Rock From The Sun...the highlight maybe? What follows is redundant boring crap until the man with the knife shows up at the school and starts killing people. That's right, the entire film is Michael Myers trying to get to the campus which Jamie Lee Curtis teaches at. Jamie Lee Curtis, Laurie Strode...or her fake name Keri Tate basically fears Michael coming after her. Sees him everywhere, when he isn't really there type business. That's the film, until the last bit when the actual killings begin and we finally get into the film. Is it too late for us to care?With the success of Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, it seems the creators of H20 wanted to mix the classic horror slasher with the teen slasher. No, the original Halloween was not a teen slasher film to me. But H20 definitely is. It's teen victims are Josh Hartnett, in his first starring role no less, and Michelle Williams, among others. Josh Hartnett is the son of Jamie Lee Curtis and she is over protective because of her past.LL Cool J makes an appearance, which I guess is the reason they cast Busta Ryhmes in the next one?It seems that I am hating on this film, when in reality it's not as bad as I make it out to be.

On the twenty year anniversary of his attack on Laurie Strode, The Shape finally tracks her down in northern California, and again tries to kill her, and her seventeen years old son. And anyone else he crosses paths with. (Why didn't she get on a plane and go to some foreign country, The Shape cannot possibly get on a plane to follow her?) Interesting idea, showing the aftermath of trauma, which had only barely been hinted at in early horror films. It begins with a well done prologue, reintroducing characters from the first film, but after a good first twenty minutes, it gets mostly dull in its second act, with far too much Scream-like nonsense, and far, far too much self-awareness: yes, we know that Janet Leigh was in Psycho, we notice her stand next to the same car she used in that film, we know she is Curtis' real life mother, we get the reference of pointlessly playing Mr. Sandman on the radio, enough already. But after the lame second act, the film picks up for its routine ""hunted becomes the hunter"" climax; probably the best climax this series has to offer. The ending is good, The Shape ruined Strode's life twice (in 1978 and again '98) and she ended whatever kind of a life he had. JLC's ""confession"" scene, to Adam Arkin, is the film's highlight; Arkin does very well in his role.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

That horror becomes a reality once again when Michael returns, embarking on a murderous roadtrip from Illinois to California, threatening the lives of Laurie's rebellious son and others. It's up to Laurie to conquer her internal demons and end Michael's evil.This film in the series takes everything back to the basics: First, bringing the character of Laurie Strode back, after being gone after the second film which already makes the film better than the other HALLOWEEN sequels. However, having Jamie Lee Curtis return as the heroine doesn't help the film much as one may think. Why? We'll get with that later. One common complaint I had with HALLOWEEN 5 was that the characters were dreadful.However, in here, the characters were quite good. They're like people we want to survive than we want dead when we first lay eyes on them. The performance by the cast, especially Jamie Lee Curtis, were nothing special though. The film also have its shares of suspenseful sequences including one that deals with trying to open a door with a set of keys that all look the same while being chased by Myers. Don't you just hate it when that happens?Technically, the film is superior to all of the HALLOWEEN films and one reason to assume this is because of the $17 million budget. I also liked the modernized score, which gave a John Williams feel. However, one huge flaw this film suffers from is that it's very clichéd. You get many, many moments of false scares that get old after the first few minutes. Also, the film doesn't take the time to develop the characters enough to know more about them. In fact, the film runs a scant 86 minutes with the credits.The film comes and goes by that quickly. It's a decent feature if you're in a Halloween mood or if you're bored in the afternoon. After all, it's a really short movie and the movie isn't actually quite bad itself but like I said, the film has few things to offer. You get what you expect from any other HALLOWEEN film and if you like the sound of that, you'll be all over this one. If not, maybe you should give it a rent.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
78,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Arguably the best of the ""Halloween"" sequels, ""H20: Twenty Years Later"" serves as the wonderful book-end to the story, offering a satisfying and entertaining conclusion.",8,1 October 2016,"Ah, the mid-to-late 1990's... sort-of a rebirth of horror in a way. After all, the period from 1990 to about 1995 was wholly and decidedly a relatively murky period for the genre, with quality releases being very few and far between. Audiences were tiring of the holdover 80's slasher flicks and ho-hum ghost stories, with really only a handful of stand-out creep-shows to keep horror fans satiated. With so few quality-choices (notably the mini-series ""It"" from the book by Stephen King and the wonderful thriller ""Candyman"" from the stories of Clive Barker), it was no wonder that the early 90's were considered a ""dead"" period.Then, ""Scream"" happened and changed everything. It proved that not only could horror be widely appealing at the hands of gifted writers and quality filmmakers, but also showed that the old tropes and clichés could be ""hip"" and ""cool"" again when handled with care and a degree of nostalgic love.So, it should come as no shock that after the colossal misfire that was the previous film (""The Curse of Michael Myers""), the ""Halloween"" series got a new lease on life with a post-""Scream"" sensibility in this 1998 release- ""Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later."" A minor degree of self-awareness, a focus on modern teenage and young adult culture and a fun blast from the past by way of original star Jamie Lee Curtis made the series relevant and modern in a way that both worked to re-invigorate interest and also pay homage to the series origins.The film was lovingly crafted to serve as a book-end to the original, cleverly taking advantage of being released on the twentieth anniversary of the John Carpenter classic as part of it's schtick. It was built up as the ""Halloween"" to end all ""Halloween's""... A ""Halloween"" for the modern era. A ""Halloween"" for the sharp and post-modern 90's crowd. And a ""Halloween"" that honored the long- beloved roots of the series.Directed by Steve Miner, the film revolves around Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie Strode, now living as a teacher under a false name. Still haunted by nightmares of her murderous sibling Michael Myers, Laurie is trying her hardest to move on. But when her brother comes calling, the stakes are set for a final and apocalyptic battle from which only one can emerge alive.The success of the film really falls onto its clear adoration of the original and the desire to ""evolve"" and ""complete"" the story that it started in a new and fresh way. You can feel the love for that film oozing in virtually every scene here, with many subtle homages and call-backs. Yet it also builds and evolves the franchise in a way that previous films hadn't. Whereas prior sequels truly did feel like they were simply trying to re-create the magic of the original to increasingly diminishing results, ""H20"" actually has the guts to say ""No, the best way to pay tribute to the origin of the series is to make homage and continue the story, but allow it to change with the times."" A huge part of that is the result of that late-90's self-aware mindset popularized by other films, and I think it works wonders. There are numerous levels of subversion that make you second-guess where it's all leading, there's plenty of banter and humor that satisfies the audience, and it also makes the wise move to make all the characters likable... nobody here really has their own agenda as so many other slasher-sequels have done with their characters.Miner's direction is strong, with a keen sense of scope, atmosphere and composition. He finds just the right balance between old- fashioned cinematography and 90's era aesthetics, giving the film a unique tone and visual palate that both compliments and contrasts with the Carpenter original.Performances are uniformly strong for the material. Curtis is a joy in her returning role, giving Laurie a grand sense of pathos but also a drive to finally face her fears. Supporting roles by the likes of Josh Hartnett, Adam Arkin and even rapper LL Cool J round out a likable and believable cast. And there's no sore thumbs to be found. Also of note is voice-over artist Tom Kane, who perfectly re- creates the brilliant dialog of the late Donald Pleasance in a wonderful opening sequence. (Also, keep your eyes peeled for future superstar Joseph Gordon- Levitt in a small role in the opening sequence!)Should I have to address any negatives, I would definitely have to dock some slight points for a frankly shaky first act, which does fall back on the old tropes and clichés a bit too much. It just feels contrary to the much stronger second and third acts of the film, and it doesn't do much to subvert expectations or built on the legacy of the series. I also take some slight issue with the film's at times break-neck pace... it's already a fairly short film, and it rushes a bit too much for everything to really set in.Still, those flaws being stated, I can't help but feel that for my money, this is the best of the ""Halloween"" sequels. It built off of what came before, served as a loving tribute and also book-ended the series with what was at the time built up to be the final entry in the series. To me, the ""Halloween"" franchise is a trilogy- Carpenter's ""Halloween"", it's first sequel ""Halloween II"" and this film, ""H20."" Everything else to me is pure fan-fiction.I give ""Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later"" a strong 8 out of 10 as a horror fan and in particular as a fan of the franchise. Definitely worth seeing.

(R)After being missing for a couple of decades, Michael Myers goes looking for his little sis, finding her working as headmistress of a boarding school under a fake name. Seventh entry in the long-running ""Halloween"" franchise ignores everything that came after part 2, and emphasizes suspense/scares over gore and body count (à la the original classic), while also adding layers of trauma to the Laurie Strode character and a light sprinkling of ""Scream""-style hipness/irony--Kevin Williamson was one of the executive producers. Unfortunately, director Miner is no John Carpenter, and the film lacks style, dread, wit...and when the kills arrive, there are no surprises, especially when it comes to who dies and who survives. Curtis makes for a sympathetic, nigh-compelling lead (her performance is easily the best thing about the movie); Arkin and Hartnett are both pretty listless as her love interest and son respectively. The cameo from Curtis' real-life mother (Leigh) alongside the car she drove in ""Psycho"" is an amusing treat (her character's name is even ""Norma"").

80,m-47826,Best sequel hands down.,7,14 August 2020,"And the perfect anniversary movie. I really despise JLC for dissing it in favor of that pretentious reboot. It gave all returning characters a great send off, and more characterization they were ever given in the original movie. Granted it was surfing the wave brought on by Scream, but if it means a more refined script and quality acting. What's wrong with that?... The opening sequence was the perfect introduction. With the first movie nurse being attacked. Sassy and full of fight spirit until her very last breath. Obviously you also have Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but his character was a punk who was meant to be killed off really fast. Start credits, despite what people think, included events of movie 4, 5 and 6. They even mentioned Laurie Strode faking her own death, in some paper article pinned to the wall. And it's supernatural elements later on the movie. So they didn't just scratch it like the 2018 version did, they only didn't went into too much details about it. And in all honesty, why would they? These events had nothing to do with the heroine, that clearly wanted to leave the Michael Myers stories behind her. The casting is pretty eclectic and a bit more substantial than the usual Halloween movies, with faces the target audience would recognize. So yeah, they played the « Scream » card there too. But once again, what's wrong with a little more juice to have the machinery work? You even have those score pieces, borrowed from Scream 1 and 2. But they fit the mood of the movie best than those written by the main composer, apparently. The theme song was kept Intact and more intense than before. The kills are not the main focus, which is best. The thrill and suspense is. Unfortunately, being part of a long running franchise, half of the work was already made. And the storyline could only go one or two ways. I don't get the hate, and why most people prefer the « new » reboot. It has the same themes, only done in a more subtle way and gave the story structure, and a perfect closure. Sadly ruined by the sequel, but it's a different topic... H20 also has those cool meta, self aware elements, while staying true to the original movie, and the time it was released. To me it compliments perfectly the 90s slasher movies list.

81,rivertam26,Mindless fun,7,28 February 2020,"The first real showdown of Jamie Lee Curtis's Laurie Strode and Michael Myers happened 20 years after the original film and it's fun but not much more. Getting the brilliant Kevin Williamson of Scream to jump on board was a smart decision to capitalize on the smart slasher craze of the era but in truth it's only mildly successful. It does nothing to really correct any of the franchise's inconsistencies unlike the 2018 version. It is however a hell of a lot of fun. They take in joy in playing up the expected cliches as well adding to the meta execution with stuff like Janet Leigh a.k.a. Psycho a.k.a Curtis's real life mom complaining about the shower drains and driving her original car. After a series of decent kills we move on to a short but effective finale where the two behemoths go head to head. Something completely ruined at the start of the next film. Sexy Josh Harnett, future Oscar winner Michelle Williams and LL Cool J hamming it up also star. Michael himself is different and I'm not sure I love it. He seems mindless and a little goofy with a spiky hairdo and I do wish they used the iconic score more instead of reject Scream tracks.

I've heard better commentaries but this one was pretty good. I had no idea Jamie was responsible for getting the ball rolling on this project as much as she did, going as far as to have lunch with Debra Hill and John Carpenter to discuss potential ideas.I'd give the commentary a solid 7/10.

83,xredgarnetx,Odd sequel,5,29 November 2006,"I caught HALLOWEEN H20 today, and it struck me as a very odd sequel. First, there was no blood to speak of and the killings were not particularly graphic, harking back to the original, which was gore-less although scary. H20 isn't scary, however, since the chap playing Michael looks like a stiff wind would knock him over. Also the mask has become so formalized over the years, it's like someone is standing in for Michael, who originally wore a simple Captain Kirk face mask, as I recall. I could be wrong, of course, and I know about the legal issues surrounding the use of Kirk's image in the followup flicks. But the current very large mask combined with the standard-issue workman's clothes made me constantly think of this Michael as an impostor. The fact that this Michael also weighs about 97 pounds did not help at all. Anyhow, Jamie Lee Curtis (unwisely) returns as Michael's sister, Laurie Strode, now living and working in northern Calif., and she gets to confront Michael only near the end of the flick. Some familiar young stars including Josh Hartnet get to play Michael's latest victims. The last two or three movies in the franchise are completely ignored, plot-wise, which was OK by me but makes this outing seem like it is happening in an alternate dimension, which is also OK by me. The sumptuous cinematography and set design can't be faulted, and the whole production is light years away from previous outings, which now look like they were all shot in or around 1978. There just isn't much to work with here, including a very sketchy and abrupt ending. Let's face it: Michael isn't Jason. He may scare his potential victims, but not the audience. Subsequent sequels have only gotten worse.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
84,baumer,I'm torn....,6,15 July 1999,"How do you capture the feel of the original Halloween?  Do you remember how the atmosphere alone gave you chills?  How the movie was so frightening because the killer was always lurking in the background?  Remember the scene where Annie is out in the laundry room and the blury image of Michael is standing behind her?  You don't know if he is going to get her or if she is going to live long enough to answer the phone.  Or what about the time when P.J. Soles thought Paul was the one standing in the door way with the ghost sheet over his head?  We all knew that it was Myers, but she didn't. And that is what made it scary.  Films like Halloween are once or twice in a decade kind of films.  There is a certain brilliance to them that no one knows how to capture anymore.  Even Carpenter himself has never been able to duplicate that fear that we felt back in 1978.  But now we have H2O.  And as good as it is, it is just not anywhere near the original.  And I guess we can't ask the film to be that good, but at least to try to come close would be nice.  And to be fair, it does in some spots.  But only some.The other problem with today's horror films is that simply, it is not 1978 or 1980 anymore.  It's almost like the look of film has improved over the years.  Back then the film stock looked grainy and even a tad bit hazy. And that added to the fear, the feel and the enjoyment.  Now scary films are just not as dark or as unknown.  The soundtrack is filled with hip and cool top 40 artists, the film tries to appeal to today's young people and in the process it alienates those of us that made films like Halloween and Friday famous.Having said that, H2O is still good.  It pays homage to the original Halloween and even to Psycho, two of the trend setters in the genre.  Jamie Lee Curtis returns and does a good job of being the traumatized survivor 20 years later.  There are some decent scares, in particular the kitchen scene with the garbage shoot.  That is old style horror at its best.  But as much as the first half of the movie works, it crumbles under its own weight at the climax.  And I can honestly say this is Steve Miner's fault.Miner did the same thing to the last installment of Friday the 13th.  He made a great beginning and then abandoned all that we held dear, took all of his skills and made the first fifteen mintues great and then reverted back to what made the last three Friday's garbage.  H2O is good for the first half and then it gets Hollywood in the final few minutes.  And that can only be attributed to the fact that Miner forgets how to direct a film for 90 minutes.  How hard is it to study a films roots and then just copy them. How hard would it have been to have the shadowy figure of Michael always lurking in the background?  Or to have him hiding behind a tree or a desk or anywhere and then appear before the camera just like the first.  As much as this film was alright, perhaps even good, it was a cheat.  It teased us with memories of how it felt to be frightened.  And then it pretended like it was a joke and they made the film just like every piece of garbage that is in the horror genre today.  So I am torn.  Yes it was good, but it could have been so much better.From what I have read, The Blair Witch Project is a film that redefines terror.  I really hope so, because I am starved for a good horror film. Something that will make me feel like I did when I first watched Jaws or the Exorcist and the first Halloween.  H2O tried but then quit trying halfway through.  And that is a disgrace.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
85,mentalcritic,Halloween Lite,1,19 October 2004,"In the 1970s, John Carpenter brought us a remarkable, atmospheric horror film called Halloween. Like all good films that are remotely successful, the moneymen of Hollywood just had to drag this one down into the mud of sequeldom. Twenty years later is a good subtitle for this film, as during a period of twenty years after the innovative original was released, the cinematic abortions that have had the name Halloween attached to them have sunk lower and lower.One reason audiences cared so much for Laurie Strode in the original is that an inordinate amount of time was invested in building up her character. John Carpenter wisely invested a great deal of time in giving her a third dimension, and it paid off in spades. Her struggle with the massive shape hunting her hit a note with audiences because they were able to imagine themselves in a similar position. That, combined with another masterful score from Carpenter, proved just how much more important atmosphere is compared to gore in horror.In case you haven't guessed by now, I've spelled out everything that is missing from Halloween H20, or Halloween Lite as it should be called. Nothing is known about most of the characters. Those who do have a background, Laurie and Michael, only achieve this relative feat due to the previous films. Laurie's son, his girlfriend, their schoolmates, they all might as well be cardboard for all the weight they add to the story.People complain that there is a lack of blood or gore in this Halloween, but that isn't a fair comment. This film is no more or less bloody than the original Halloween, yet it has less than a tenth of the impact. The reason for this is as simple as it is obvious. Halloween spent a good portion of its running time setting a mood, be it through storytelling, immaculate photography, or one of the best scores ever composed by human hands. Halloween understood that the whole was greater than the sum of the parts, and gave as much as detail as it could. In spite of running only six less minutes, Halloween Lite gives the appearance of containing profoundly less.One day, Hollywood is going to realize how tired the public is of films that try to be hip. The more you have to tell your audience that you're the in thing, and are so cool you can't be ignored, the more you aren't. It's like a natural law. A variation on the law that states the more you tell people how hardcore you are, the more hardcore you aren't, but one that applies all the same. Still, more excruciating examples of what happens when you forget this principle exist within the Halloween franchise. Just look at the next godawful sequel.I gave Halloween Lite a one out of ten. If you've seen the original Halloween, there is no good reason to see this installment. Nostalgia, hype, or even flat-out lies couldn't save this sequel. It's enough to make one wish Hollywood would stop bringing out so many films every week and instead concentrated on finding some new ideas.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

She also has a 17 year old son who's attending that school. Now, some twenty years later, Michael has tracked Laurie down and intends on finishing what he started in '78.This sequel completely ignores installments 4, 5 and 6 and that, in itself, is annoying. Although it would have been hard to include that Thorn crap that the 6th installment introduced I think they could have at least made an effort to tie all the films together. But anyhow, this 7th entry is a good film in my opinion. Overall it's decently written, reasonably fast paced and has a knockout finale that should have ended the series. Although the film is nearly devoid of any gore, it's got quite a few chills and at least one scene that's very disgusting (involving a broken leg).Jamie Lee Curtis makes a welcome return to the series and delivers a good performance. Hartnett, Arkin and even the rapper all contribute heavily and make for a good ensemble cast. It seemed to annoy some Halloween fans the level of inside jokes (for example Leigh's car) but I liked them, countless references to other films.Former Friday the 13th director (one of them) Steve Miner does a good job, creates an overall creepy mood and keeps things moving at a rapid pace, the film is less than 80 minutes long.In short, H20 is one of the better sequels, I don't care what most fans say.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

Unfortunately, we don't even get a bad one in H20, arguably the classiest of the sequels, but also debatably the least scary.When Halloween: H20 came out, the franchise was in a bit of disarray. Only one other film had been made during the nineties, and that was three years previously. The violent, and, quite frankly, ridiculous, Purse of Michael Myers saw an increasingly effeminate killer stagger around doing pretty much the same old thing. Except this time around his motivation was that he was a druid, and that all of his killings were dedicated to rune stones. It brought back the nice idea of featuring classic movies during the film, a first since Season of the Witch, but on every other level it was a complete washout.And then along came H20. In a sense, it's a brilliant title. For one thing, it gives the impression to some that this is the twentieth instalment. (It's actually the seventh). This makes it an easy starting point for anyone, because who's going to go through the backstory of nineteen movies? Secondly, it refers to it being twenty years since the events of the first two films. Dumbly, though, it misleads the viewer (well, me, at any rate) into thinking this is a waterbound instalment. Michael Myers in a submarine? On a yachting holiday, perhaps? Feeding the ducks down the local pond?. But no! It's just the same old rubbish we've seen five times before.It starts brilliantly, with the high-power acting of Jamie Lee Curtis enabling the audience not to dwell too much on the absence of Donald Pleasence. (Despite what some may claim, this film doesn't necessarily contradict the events of the last three sequels, and does provide an explanation for why Curtis' character was proclaimed dead in the fourth). However, a plethora of teen-victims-by-numbers, and a Myers whose wig has come more and more to resemble Lou Ferringo mean this isn't exactly a trip to the launderette for even those of a nervous disposition.Maybe the flaws in this film aren't exactly the fault of the series itself, merely audience expectations. After all, Halloween must be praised for keeping things going, even amongst the moribund horror era of the late eighties/early nineties. However, when 1996's Scream revitalised the genre it placed down a whole new set of parameters for horror films to live up to. You expect a horror film of the late nineties (or, come to that, ANY film of the late nineties) to meet to the new trend of longer runtimes. Scream ran for an hour and forty-six minutes on its British release. H20 has just 70 minutes left to play out after the opening titles have died down. And then there's the irony. But then again, for a series that has, give or take, always played it straight, why should we expect it to suddenly follow a passing (passed?) phase and go all ""post-modern""? Perhaps it's commendable that the only things H20 does are reference Psycho (Janet Leigh takes a role and has some meaningful dialogue) and show a clip of Scream 2. Kevin Williamson had an uncredited writer's job but it's not particularly evident. H20 at least stuck to its guns.Yet brevity it what really makes it feel lacking, a mere scrap of a movie, while Curtis' transformation into a Sarah Connor/Ellen Ripley ass-kicking machine is as ludicrous as it is ineptly staged. Her final vengeance  cutting off Myers' head with an axe  seems to put paid to what could be any chance of a sequel. But Myers dies with his arms outstretched, then comes back from the dead  in a bodybag, no less  is this a subtle religious analogy I see before me? Who knows, maybe Curtis will be the new psychopath for Evil Never Dies  or maybe the druids will come back with a clone? Whatever happens, H20's conclusion has ensured that whatever credibility the series had (Err... none at all?) has now completely dissipated.

After a brief respite in horror cinema in the early 1990s, movies with psychopaths, blood and scares successfully reappeared on screen from 1996 onwards, with the release of Scream (Scream, by Wes Craven, creator of Nightmare on Elm Street), which spurred a crop of similar films. And this wave of movies of easy scares boosted the production of the genre generating, among others, Halloween H20, the remake of Psycho.Under the direction of Steve Miner, filmmaker who signed two milestones in the subgenre, namely, the trajectory of the masked Jason in Friday 13 parts 2 and 3, Myers' new venture is a dizzying rush of adrenaline, without leaving a moment of some to appreciate the dramatic quality of its narrative, an efficient study of family relationships, traumas and transversal themes. Right from its opening, we know that there is no escape for characters immersed in the vicinity of Halloween. Witty, it turns out that Nurse Marion (Nancy Stephens) has been taking care of Dr. Loomis, Michael Myers' psychiatrist, for several years. Upon arriving home, she realizes that someone has gone through her files in search of information about Laurie Strode, the 1978 survivor who in the second film, we know to be the psychopath's sister. Despite trying to help out with Jimmy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Tony (Branden Williams), neighborhood youth, there is no other destination for these preambular characters. Shattered by the maniac, they are the first of the long trail of death Myers intends to leave on his journey.After the frantic opening, we know that the antagonist stole information from Laurie Strode, now Keri Tate, the head of an educational institution who faked her own death to let go of the traumas of the past. Even though she wakes up daily from nightmares that seem to accompany her for long periods, Strode, played with great sincerity and delivery by Jamie Lee Curtis, still suffers from the memories. This makes her almost unbearable in the treatment of her son John (Josh Hartnett), a student at Hillcrest, a luxurious fortress-like unit. His great conflict is to live daily in fear of his brother's return, possibly dead after the hospital fire on Halloween 2 - The Nightmare Continues, something that is not certain, as the body was never found and has been reported missing for twenty years. Panic seizes his life when he realizes that October 31 is near and that Michael Myers might return, which he does. By the way, in the best shape.For the franchise's 20th anniversary, Moustapha Akkad and Dimension Films were preparing something special, with H20: Halloween: Twenty Years Later serving to celebrate the birth of Michael Myers and also deliver something bespoke to a generation hungry for more horror movies. Shrewd and self-aware. The result? Far short of what it promised, but definitely one of the worthiest continuations of the saga - which is not necessarily the highest praise. H20 definitely brought a lot of fan anticipation, but let's face it: just for the return of Jamie Lee Curtis, as the plot itself is the same as always. The big draw of Robert Zappia and Matt Greenberg's script (based on a script by Kevin Williamson, the screenwriter of Scream) was to ignore the previous sequels, being a sequel to Halloween II: The Nightmare Continues and acting as a retcom for the franchise. The problem lies in the lack of news, with the characters of Josh Harnett, Michelle Williams, LL Cool J and company not bringing any kind of empathy; the inspiration in Scream is there, in bringing in the most ironic young people, but it lacks the satirical metalanguage of the Wes Craven film series.Halloween H20 made a bold move when it decided to skip the last three chapters of the film series and serve as a sequel to Halloween II (1981). They got Jamie Lee Curtis to reprise her iconic role as Laurie Strode, and they brought in another actress from the second, Nancy Stephens, to make a point as nurse Marion Chambers, who assisted Dr. Loomis. It was a full plate for the fans. Michael was back and Laurie was back too. It was the ultimate clash. And it's undeniable that H20 works a lot with nostalgia in its engine and this will make the movie better than it really is. But that's not the only reason, as the script and director try hard to emulate the suspense and tension of the early films without turning it into a free slasher like the later sequels. The choice was risky and ended up leaving the narrative a little slurred, the viewer is looking forward to actually seeing Michael in action, which will happen more often after almost 50 minutes of film. But when the deaths actually start happening, they don't disappoint. The assassin is never lacking, killing his victims in brutal ways that cause goose bumps and discomfort.The script manages to be coherent and more expressive than any episode between the first movie and this one. The textual content gained strength in the staging of Jamie Lee Curtis, an actress who plays a new final girl, now aware of her strength and who needs to embody Lieutenant Ripley's mix with Sarah Connor to leave prepared for the attack. The best scenes, given that much of the mid-final of the film is the fight between the two brothers. Deborah Everton's costumes were essential for contemplating the character's dramatic needs and visual explanation of her internal and external conflicts, in addition to fulfilling the psychological, physical and social representations of Keri Tate, an initially fearful woman, but forced to surrender to a clash where you don't know if you'll come out alive. All this, a survival instinct to not only save yourself, but preserve the life of your beloved child. Some manage to survive, others, such as Will (Adam Arkin), a professor at the institution and his boyfriend, cannot escape Myers' sharp blade.The charm is right with Curtis. Seeing Laurie Strode so transformed and dealing with the trauma of that night twenty years ago yields some of the best moments of the film, especially when she reveals to her boyfriend (played by a competent Adam Arkin) about her real identity, in a scene that mixes the trauma drama with a strange sensuality, as Laurie confesses during the foreplay of a romantic encounter. Also, the fact that we see her mother Janet Leigh interacting with her is something that gives long-time moviegoers shivers, being the definitive bridge between Halloween and Psycho by bringing in veteran actress from Alfred Hitchcock's shower scene.In terms of direction, it's good to see that Steve Miner aims to bring the Carpenter spirit back, betting on rich framing and situations typical of the first chapter of the series. The film's prologue (which features a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a good example of this, with a classic set up of a house invaded by a murderer that we still haven't fully seen. Subsequent horror sequences get more breath thanks to inspiration from Scream, so much so that the studio even used tracks from Marco Beltrami's work in Craven's film as a complement to John Ottman's solid work - something that deeply angered the original composer. The gore is also stronger here, something that was to be expected at the time, and Miner explores it well while always maintaining suspense, see the scene where Jodi Lyn O'Keefe tries to escape Myers through a food elevator.With just 80 minutes, the ending even sounds a little rushed, as the location could have been better used for more chase scenes or something like that. Anyway, it seems that the script is concerned with eliminating the secondary characters soon so that the confrontation between Laurie and Michael is the main highlight, which is just right. Halloween H20 closes an informal trilogy to the satisfaction of fans of the franchise and that's why a lot of people love this chapter, which could have been a definitive ending if not for ""Resurrection"", which would come four years later.Luxurious for a slasher, in Halloween H20, there is the metalinguistic process common to films at the time, with references to Scream 2, as in one scene two characters watch the film while getting ready for a party, as well as Carrie and the ""original"" of the series. There's also a tribute to actor Donald Pleasence, right after the credits, as the film was dedicated to the actor (I wonder why not at first, just to be more obvious). The shocking ending left room for the Aristotelian ""mandatory scene"". What would have happened to the character of Jamie Lee Curtis after the final showdown with brother Michael Myers.Unfortunately, the producers didn't let the scene populate the viewers' minds. Halloween H20 certainly helps bring us a more dignified Michael Myers than the ghastly previous chapters, ignoring the resurrections and satanic cults around him, and the return of Jamie Lee Curtis alone is a factor that makes the visit enjoyable. All that was needed was something that would justify the meeting, that would bring news and go beyond the basic proposal.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
93,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"Not exactly perfect, but still one of the better Halloween films",8,31 October 2020,"20 years after the events of the original Halloween, Laurie Strode, now having post-traumatic stress, fakes her death and goes in hiding in a private boarding school in California. However, Michael Myers finds her a starts his new killing spree and it's up to Laurie to battle him one last time as the life of her son hangs in the balance.Halloween H20: 20 Years Later isn't exactly a perfect sequel, but it's an improvement over Curse of Michael Myers and Halloween Part 2 (and while I understand that there's other people who didn't like Halloween 4 and 5, I actually liked them with Halloween 4 being one of the better entries) and is one of the better entries.Now it's not without it's flaws, though. The pacing felt pretty uneven and did get rushed at times, it doesn't offer much in character development aside from Laurie Strode and the script did feel pretty weak and lacks the spark of the original film.That being said, there are some worthwhile elements. The production design is really great, it does capture the creepiness and suspense the original Halloween offered, John Ottman does a great job with his own score and reprises the iconic theme very well, the death kills are creative, and the acting is very good the best coming from Jamie Lee Curtis who reprises her role very well and while underdeveloped the other characters at least have some personality.Overall, Halloween H20: 20 Years Later, like I said before, isn't a perfect sequel, but it's still one of the better entries next to Halloween 4 and 3 (which many people also didn't like, but I also liked that as well) and this is worth watching to those who like the original film.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

But Laurie is still traumatised after the events from 20 years ago where her friends got murdered and finding out the man who did them was her own brother Michael Myers. Laurie still lives in fear that Micheal Myers is still alive and is still coming after her as he spent 15 years in a mental hospital after killing her other sister, waiting to kill her. Since then Laurie drinks her troubles away and her young son (Josh Hartnett) takes care of her and is quite frankly getting fed up. But it seems Laurie's fears are true Michael Myers is still alive and is coming to get her.Finally the Halloween series is back on form after the disappointing parts 5 and 6, Halloween H20 bounces back in what is probably the best one after the first one of course, and plus Jamie Lee Curtis is back and really kicks ass. Although it was sad to see Dr Loomis was not in it but that couldn't be helped, and plus the acting is on form in this one as well. OK the gore and body count is rather low but the suspense and tension is there and at times it does feel like a Scream movie and not a Halloween movie but overall the movie worked.Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie) is back and better than ever I loved the final showdown scene where she fights back, Josh Hartnett (John) was impressive in his debut role, so glad he's gone on to bigger and better things and plus the chemistry between him and Jamie Lee Curtis is spot on. LL Cool J (Ronny) was good at the comic relief role, Michelle Williams was sweet and cute as the feisty Molly, Jodi Lyn O' Keefe (Sarah) was fun and has the best death scene Adam Hann-Byrd (Charlie) has fun as the sex starved student and there's no way a girl that looks like O Keefe would date him, Janet Leigh Jamie's mother has a cameo and I really liked the scenes between her and Jamie although very brief and bit player Nancy Stephens also comes back only to be killed off very quickly.All in all a welcome return to the franchise.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
98,Darkside-Reviewer,Michael Myers infiltrates One Tree Hill,6,1 February 2021,"Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998) is the seventh entry in the Halloween franchise. It was also the first reboot in the franchise until the (2007) remake of the first Halloween film which was written and directed by Rob Zombie. After the critical box office disappointment of Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995) the Halloween franchise went through a bit of crisis of where to take the series next. Luckily Jamie Lee Curtis was on board for a reboot of the original Halloween story which would bring back her iconic character Laurie Strode. This was intended as the final film in the franchise and was meant to end the story with a final fight between Michael and Laurie that would end a twenty year long story. Sadly that didn't happen. Since the movie made such a profit at the box office a sequel was made Halloween Resurrection (2003) which ruined not only the great ending to H20 but the movie bombed so hard that it almost killed the franchise altogether.The Halloween franchise now has so many timelines that it's hard to keep up with. At this point Laurie Strode has died more times than Michael has. Halloween H20 is probably one of the better sequels in the franchise it definitely has it's flaws and it's ending was ruined in the Resurrection sequel. But putting all that aside in 1998 H20 was a highly anticipated movie at the time the idea of Jamie Lee Curtis returning to the series for a twenty year later reunion fight against Michael Myers was something fans like myself never thought would happen in a million years. The Halloween (2018) reboot is by far the best sequel/reboot in the entire franchise no contest but back in 1998 the idea of rebooting a movie series was still a relatively new idea.The best way to describe Halloween H20 is imagine if Michael Myers infiltrated the set of One Tree Hill and went on a killing spree. Josh Hartnett plays Laurie's son John in his first role as a serious actor. Also in the movie is a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt who ends up getting a hockey skate jammed into his face. Admittedly there aren't that many death scenes in H20 and the gore is cut down on when compared to some of the other sequels but there's still plenty of blood, stabbing and hangings to enjoy.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

After taking a long hiatus from horror movies, Curtis returned to the series to reprise her starmaking role as Laurie Strode. It starts with a suspenseful 10 minute opening, with Michael Myers discovering where his other sister (Curtis, which we discovered was Michael Myers other sister in ""Halloween II"") is hiding out. This movie finally takes Michael Myers out of Haddonfield (where all the other movies took place with the exception of ""Halloween III"") and puts him in a small town in California, which is where Laurie Strode (now under the name Keri Tate) has made a new life for herself and her rebellious 17 year old son. I was getting sick and tired of Michael Myers prowling around Haddonfield in all those bad sequels. A new location was one thing that this series needed. Laurie/Keri is now the headmistress of a private school in the town of Summer Glen, California. But she still has nightmares about what almost happened to her 20 years ago, and those nightmares would become a reality if her brother finds out where she's hiding. There are plenty of scares in this one, and it's not as violent as the other sequels in the series. Director Steve Miner (who directed the second and third ""Friday the 13th"" movies) does a good job with this film, and it gets a big boost from a couple of good performances. Curtis is excellent as always, matched by Josh Hartnett as her son John; Michelle Williams of TV's ""Dawson's Creek"" as Hartnett's girlfriend; Adam Arkin of TV's ""Chicago Hope"" as the school dean and Curtis' boyfriend; Curtis' real-life mother and ""Psycho"" star Janet Leigh in a bit part as Curtis' secretary; and LL Cool J (providing most of the comedy) as the school's security guard. ""Halloween H20"" delievers scares and shocks, and the final result is a movie that's not as good as the first ""Halloween"", slightly better than ""Halloween II"", but much better than ""Halloween III, IV, V, and VI"".

And it works! For the most part. Lightning is very much improved and used in a way to set the creepy mood better. There are scenes reused from ""Scream"" (which looks and feels cheap in a ""exploit the gold rush"" kind of way, but you get over it because ""Scream"" is cool), homages to the original movies and the movie really shines when Laurie confronts Michael. I mean, she's a mother of all final girls and it's shown pretty well in this movie. Sadly, not everything is so great. While the movie can pass as fun, the tension is lost due to constant jumpscares. It's too fast for ""Halloween"", it's a more of typical slasher. Also, Michael Myers looks kinda... Weird? Not really scary, looks like he got electrocuted. Still, being fan on the ""Scream"" series, I like this movie too. It's a more decent thing than ""Halloween 5"" and ""Halloween 6"" for sure.

Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has spent the last 20 years living with the horror of her past. Her brother Michael killed their sister, and has spent the rest of his life trying to kill Laurie. For 20 years however, she hasn't heard anything from him, but now, on Halloween, Michael is back. Laurie has moved to a small boarding school in California, and changed her life. She faked her own death, and is now living as Keri Tate. The only person who knows the truth about her is her 17-year-old son John (Josh Hartnett). Everyday she lives with the fear that Michael will come back. This time, she's right. I have to tell you first off, I love horror films. Movies like the original Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, and current classic Scream are among my all time favorites. So when I heard that not only were they making another sequel to Halloween, but that Jamie Lee Curtis was reprising her character from the original, I had to go see it. And I wasn't disappointed. There was only one problem I had with the movie. However, telling you the problem would give away basically the entire story.
But continuing on, this movie was full of the normal horror film chills and thrills. Michael kills a bunch of people with his trusty kitchen knife. There are a lot of those, you think Michael is there but it turns out to be someone else, moments, where the music tries to scare you just as much as the action on the screen. Having Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie is great, because you actually feel like this production is bigger and better than your normal horror film. Michael seems a lot meaner, and a lot more calculating than in the past, which just makes him that much scarier. And that mask still gives me nightmares. Adam Arkin, Michelle Williams, and LL Cool J are some of the supporting characters, and I'll let you guess which one (or ones) survives. And my favorite scene, one that you see in the trailers, is when Laurie and Michael look at each other through a small window. It's truly like the face of good and the face of evil are separated only by a thin piece of glass. Maybe that's a metaphor for life. Sorry, got a little philosophical there. Besides the title and having Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie, there's nothing about this film that makes it stand out. But what it does offer is the chance to go out and get scared, and that it does very well. People were jumping out of their seats every few minutes, and during the climactic scenes, every few seconds. The production looks more polished than almost all of the cheesy horror films that come out today, and the direction I noticed was also a lot better. Overall, if you're a horror film fan, and you like the tradition of the Halloween series, I'd definitely go out and see Halloween: H20. And if you know nothing about the original, and just want a good scare, this one will do it for you.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
114,hellholehorror,Final part of the trilogy,7,21 October 2021,I felt quite a strong return to form with this Halloween outing. This was the true final part of the trilogy. It really ramps up the excitement in the last twenty minutes. The story tries to be clever but who cares really. It was violent and there were plenty of scares so it filled the role really well. If you want to save some time then take this as the final part of the original trilogy and forgive the first slow hour.,Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
115,bsinc,Take...20,3,2 November 2003,"I saw the original ""Halloween"" two days ago and this final installment was on TV yesterday so in some people's opinion I saw the best these last 20 years of horror movies had to offer. Well, these certain individuals can shove it up their........... Well, the slashing is AGAIN(read my ""Halloween"" comment for explanation) a minor part of this (ironically? or sadly?)slasher movie. What exactly have these horror directors been doing for these 20 years or so, I'd really like to know. NOT MUCH, that's for sure, because the ""horror"" parts are so horror-free and uninventive it's rather insulting to the viewer who bothers to see such a movie. That's the main reason why I gave up on this zhanra long ago and never rent such movies, there's simply far, far, far to many bad and extremely lame ""horror"" flicks to rightfully balance that 2 percent or less of the really scary and horrific movies. So finding one of the good ones is like finding a needle in a haystack. ""H20"" definitely falls into the first category, it's not the worst horror movie I've seen, but here's the trick, it's not a horror movie at all. Besides maybe 3 scenes where blood(which deserves mentioning later) is present the rest of the movie just kind of feels like a teenager-parent drama with some vulgar language. I haven't seen(and won't) the rest of the Halloween movies but I have a strong feeling there's not much else to be seen, the whole series blows. And whoever thought of making a ""Halloween VS Hellraiser"" movie is on the yellow brick road to cuckoo land. ""H20"" is not that bad a movie if you put it into a different category of zhanra, what's saddening is that they haven't done squat to improve anything from the 20 years older original. The score is worse, no cinematography worth mentioning, and let's not forget that the first one was almost 60 times less expensive to make, and they definitely took a giant step back with the fake-blood. It's so tomato-soup like you just have to see it to believe it. And there's so much of it in this one scene you'd think Michael slaughtered the whole cast when in fact it's just this one girl. Trust me, take my word for it, this slacker movie ain't worth your time. 3/10",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
116,domino1003,"Welcome Back, Jamie",9,24 August 2005,"""Halloween H20"" brings back Michael Myers, who is still after his sister, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). However, a lot has changed since he last stalked her. Years before, Laurie faked her own death (By auto accident)and has resurfaced as Keri Tate, the headmistress of a prep school in California. She also has a son named John (Josh Hartnett), who just turned 17 and is eager to escape his mother's grasp. Keri's way of dealing with the trauma of her past includes pills and booze. Even her fellow colleague and lover Will (Adam Arkin)is unaware of her past, but knows that something is troubling her.She decides to let her son go on a school field trip, but isn't aware that John, his girlfriend Molly (Michelle Williams), and their 2 friends are having a party on campus instead. It isn't until she realizes that the phones are out, her son's stuff is still in his room, and that Ronny the security guard (LL Cool J) notices that there's an abandoned car outside the gates, that there is a serious problem. Not to mention the fact that it is Halloween.After finally seeing her brother face to face, she decides to confront him, once and for all. And this is the real core of the film: Keri is no more: Laurie has to confront her demons and face the thing she fears the most: Her homicidal brother.For those who are new to the series, you may want to watch the first 2 films before you watch this one. Forget parts 4-6, since none of the events that happened in those films are even mentioned (And Part 3 isn't connected to the series at all).It is nice to see Jamie Lee Curtis back in form and tougher than ever. And it's very cute to see the late Janet Leigh (As Norma)in a small tribute tho Psycho (Check out the car she's driving and the music, if you don't believe me!).",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

A nice touch is that Jamie Lee reprises her role as Laurie Strode now a head teacher for the high school with a new name.One thing that annoys me with H20 and Ressuerction is that they disregard Halloween 4-6, those sequels was alright and they disregard them. The film could of worked with them but I guess they thought differently.Other than that Halloween H20 isn't bad, the gore might not be as good as Halloween 5 and 6 but it's still good enough since it was directed by Steve Miner who directed Friday the 13th Part 2 and Part III.An alright sequel to the Halloween franchise.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

I was glad that Jamie Lee Curtis's character was in this one. I heard that there is going to be another Halloween movie, but it will not be as good as the original, and H2O.

This movie is from the same production company that did Scream...you can tell but that's not a bad thing.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
121,Gafke,A really fun homage to the first movie,8,1 April 2006,"20 years have passed since Michael Meyers went on his bloody killing spree in Haddonfield, Illinois. Laurie Strode, the only survivor of the massacre, has since faked her own death in an auto accident, changed her name to Keri Tate and has gone into hiding with her son, John. Now a headmistress at a prestigious private school, Laurie has become a paranoid and emotionally damaged woman with too many prescriptions and a liquor cabinet that never runs dry. She also cannot let John out of her sight, virtually imprisoning him within the locked gates of the school. But John has finally begun to rebel. Sick of his mother's neurosis, he skips the school trip and retreats with his girlfriend and two others to the storage rooms for an all night party. It is Halloween night, 1998, and Laurie realizes that John, who has just turned seventeen, is now the same age that she was when her brother came looking for her. Her sense of foreboding proves to be not without merit: Michael Meyers is alive, he has found his way to the school and he is looking for John, Laurie and anyone who gets in his way.This 7th installment in the Halloween series skips over parts 3, 4, 5 and 6 and serves as a direct sequel to part 2, making the series into a trilogy for those who might prefer it that way. It's also a really fun homage to the first two films and to the genre at large. Numerous references and in-jokes pop up constantly throughout the film, cleverly worked into the story instead of taking away from it. Jamie Lee Curtis makes her triumphant return as Laurie and brings her character full circle, from frightened screaming victim to ass-kicking woman who has finally Had Enough. The kids are surprisingly quite likable as well; they're not vacuous, empty-headed, one dimensional idiots served up like cattle for the slaughter, but rather well drawn characters that you are allowed to identify with and care about. Josh Hartnett and Michelle Williams, who later went on to bigger films and incredible fame, really shine here as the teenage leads. Adam Arkin as Laurie's boyfriend Will is such a sweet, genuinely nice character that you will be very sorry to see him go.Chris Durand as Michael Meyers is really great, perhaps the most threatening, PO'd boogeyman since Kane Hodder put on the hockey mask. He really gives Michael life in this movie, making him a violent, quite scary and very angry killer. The scene in which he is hunting Laurie in the dining room, throwing tables aside easily but with furious force, is really tense.This sequel should satisfy many fans of the original. But there are some who may be bored as well. The gore is minimal, there is no gratuitous sex and a lot of time is spent with character development and the building of suspense. I thought it was one of the more intelligent sequels to follow the original, and a lot of fun to boot. Die-hard fans of the first movie should not miss this one.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
122,skybrick736,Halloween H20 7/10,7,4 February 2015,"Besides Halloween II, no other movie in the franchise hit the chilling shivery atmosphere like Halloween H20. This feeling first sinks in when the opening scenes follow Nancy Stephens who plays Nurse Marion Chambers from the first two movies. Jamie Lee Curtis is also back along with a solid cast around her such as Josh Hartnett and LL Cool J, which really makes the film quality. The direction and dialog was weak in a few spots but the scenes are never bland. H20 also might have the best Myers mask in the franchise and the actor did a great job portraying him to be cold and calculated. It's too bad that this Halloween H20 wasn't the last of the franchise because the ending would have been amazingly perfect but sadly the only real way to kill Michael Myers is by the box office numbers.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
123,Finfrosk86,Gives me good vibes!,8,2 June 2015,"This was actually the first movie in the Halloween-series, that I saw. The first time I saw it, I didn't like it that much, but then I just kept liking it better every time I saw it.If I can watch only one of the Halloweens, this will most likely be it. It's from the sweet nineties, (I love 90's movies) it has Josh Hartnett, it has Jamie Lee Curtis, it's new enough to not look very old. And it's just something about the atmosphere that I really like. So cozy!Also, it's intriguing (espescially before I knew the reason for it) that Michael has two different masks. In some scenes he has a more plain mask, kind of porcelain doll-ish, and in the rest of the scenes he has one that looks more like the original mask. This ads a certain mystique, that I really like. I remember a screen shot from the movie, in some magazine or something, where Michael has his enormous knife raised, with blood on it, wearing the porcelain-looking (new) mask.. I could just stare and stare at that picture, for some reason. Michael Myers, Halloween, all the different versions of the mask in the sequels, it just always really fascinated me. And this is the one that introduced me to Halloween, after I saw this one, I bought one after the other of the rest of em. Now I own them all, of course. I am a horror buff, after all.But yeah, the movie. I think it's pretty darn good. Got some good kills, some good characters that you care about (a little bit at least). Michael is pretty good, personally I prefer him a lot bigger, but he is OK, his body language is excellent. But what I like the most though, is the overall feeling of the movie. Gives me the right vibes. Makes me wish I could celebrate a real American Halloween.Halloween H20, I just like ya!",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
124,theshadow908,Finally! A good sequel.,7,20 May 2006,"Halloween: Twenty Years Later makes the wise choice of ignoring Halloween 3-6 and picking up 20 years after part 2 ended. Laurie Strode has faked her death and changed her name to Keri Tate. She is now the dean of a private school that her so attends. Michael Myers finally figures out that she's alive and tracks her down to the school where he proceeds to kill teenagers that have stayed behind from a field trip. While it's not as good as the first movie, this 7th entry finally gets a sequel right.The plot is really good. It returns to the old formula of making Michael Myers a mystery that stalks his prey in the shadows. Michael also looks closer to how he looked in parts 1 and 2 instead of the hulking monster in 4, 5 and 6. Many scenes in this movie mirror the original, and it makes you appreciate how cool it is. For instance, a girl in class looks out the window and sees Michael, and when she looks back he's gone. This happens in the first movie. Michael cuts Laurie's arm with the knife in the exact place as the first film. Also, Laurie stabs Michael six times and sends him off a balcony, just like when he was shot six times and fell off a balcony in the first film.The acting in this movie is better than the previous ones. Of course, Jamie Lee Curtis is a more accomplished actress now, so she knows what she's doing. Josh Hartnett does well in his first starring role. What I like the best about this movie is that it stays true to the original Halloween formula, and it does it well. John Carpenter had to have been impressed with this.Overall, this is the best of the sequels besides part 2, and it's truly entertaining. Essential to any fan of the series.7/10",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
125,Didier-Becu,THE FINAL OR WHAT?,5,13 August 2003,"It was a bit unexpected but a new chapter from John Carpenter came out in 1998 (and I saw there are already plans to make an other sequel) and of course sequels are sequels and they only equal the original motherbase on a rather rare base but the good thing is that Jamie Lee Curtis is back! It is indeed 20 years ago that Michael Myers slaughtered some people with a kitchen knife on Halloween's eve and Laurie Strode (played by Curtis and who is the sister of the psycho) is still scared and sees the image of the maniacal Myers everywhere she looks, and not mentioning the careness for her son who is so fed up by mom's frightenings that he decided to go to a party that was forbidden for him...you can guess the rest. Of course this movie isn't original at all, it's just your common horrorcinema (director Steven Miner did some Friday the 13th-sequels) but it's the good acting that makes this film quite enjoyable. We don't have to be convinced by Curtis' skills but even rapper LL Cool J was nice to see.... Yup you forget it the morning after it was good to be see though...",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
126,bh_tafe3,Not really a Halloween movie,6,1 February 2009,"Jamie Lee Curtis thought she was really onto something when she agreed to star in this. One of her favourite things about it was that it pretended the Jamie Lloyd trilogy didn't exist, and by ignoring those bad movies they were back on track to what the original series had been all about.If they were trying to appeal to fans of the original, they failed miserably. There was no claustrophobic atmosphere, there were no startling kills hidden in the shadows, this was just I Know What You Did Last Summer starring Micheal Myers.Negating the previous three films didn't really endear this one with the Halloween series fanboys either. So in the end you have a Halloween movie that is different in atmosphere, audience and storyline to any film in the series, aside from the third one.As a halloween movie, it's a fail. However, as a stand alone movie it isn't that bad. This film came on the back of the successful Scream movies, and was following the newer formula, satirising the genre with some clichéd situations and characters and knowing winks to the audience, but at the same time being very careful to paint the killer, Micheal as very threatening.The formula is followed well and the end result is a reasonable movie. Too bad they alienated their biggest fans before they even bought it out.Some nudity, mild sex scenes. Overall a decent film worth watching.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

130,flicklover,Liked it more when it came out. It didn't aged well.,6,4 April 2021,"When this film came out in 1998 it got a lot of hype because of the return of Jamie Lee Curtis to the role that made her famous 20 years after she played Laurie Strode in the original Halloween. It was well received and resurrected a dead franchise. The Halloween series had gone off the rails after a decent return of Michael Myers in Halloween 4. The 5th and 6th films were really bad. They had gone so far from what made Halloween good that the film's seemed more like parodies with men in black, druid cults, Thorn curses had driven the series into the ground. So the idea of bringing Jamie Lee Curtis back and ignoring the preceding 3 sequels was a good idea to many. The film did well and I enjoyed it.But after multiple watched over the years I have changed my mind a little. Though it is better than what the previous sequels were, it is really isn't much better. In fact it's very average. One very annoying thing about this film is that it has so many false alarm jump scares that it gets annoying.The story, apparently written by Scream screen writer Kevin Williamson begins in Haddonfield with Michael finding a file on Laurie Strode. She had been presumed dead in a car accident years before. Laurie had faked her death and was living in California under an assumed name. She is a headmistress a boarding school. She has a son, John that is played by Josh Hartnett but is still very traumatized by what happened to her. She has nightmares and is a functioning alcoholic. Michael finds his way to the school and starts to do his thing of course. This all leads to the long awaited face off between Michael and his sister Laurie. The film does what it does, it is a typical slasher film. The characters, including Laurie's son are just stock teenagers waiting to party and get killed by the man with knife. It would have been so.much better to.just focus more on Laurie and her problems, which are treated only superficially. I get that this is a slasher film but it would have been much better to get more about that. The film is well shot but feels very generic. There is minimal.tension becayse we know what's coming. Some of the kills are well done and the ultimate confrontation between Michael and his sister is good, but not as riveting as it should be. Jamie does get to.kick som butt but it all feels kind of anti climactic. I think this film did so well because it was definitely better than the nonsense of the previous two other sequels before it but after multiple viewings it just hasn't held up as well over the years.Very average entry.Grade: C.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
131,Rendanlovell,Enjoyable enough,5,20 August 2020,"Couldn't hate on this one. Does it drop most of it's painstakingly set up characters at the end? Yes. Does it have an incredibly silly looking Myers? Yes it does. But is it competent? More so then most of the last Halloween films.This is the first time in the series where Jamie Lee Curtis was brought back and I liked her a lot in this. She plays a tortured, PTSD prone, head mistress of a secluded private school. She hasn't moved on after 20 years of being free from Michael. She sees him everywhere and is constantly paranoid. That's the best stuff in this. I like that idea much more then the 2018 version of her.Somehow it rings more honest to me. She also has a child now, who is an unfortunately bad Josh Hartnett. Jamie gives a great performance and totally carries this film. Like I said, it's competent but that's about it. Without her it would be an intolerably slow, fake out heavy slasher movie.Nothing really stands out. It's sole goal seems to be simply getting to the end with as little hiccups as possible. The story is played incredibly safe, likeable characters are kept alive, and there is little to the story outside of Michael coming back to kill Laurie Strode...again. The film is retreading the same terrain that Halloween did.The difference is the original is good. False scares do not establish an intoxicating atmosphere the way subtlety does in the original. That one takes it's time establishing the story, the characters, and the atmosphere. This one I think does a great job setting up compelling characters and then does nothing with them.Lauries son wants to distance himself from his ""crazy"" mom. So his arch should be learning to trust her judgment, but he just drives out of the film before the 3rd act. I was satisfied with Lauries arch overall but she's the only one done this favor. Everyone else are tools to be used by the script.While the film isn't bad, it isn't good either. It struggles to build to a satisfactory conclusion as it clocks in under 90 minutes. Giving the filmmakers very little wiggle room for character dynamics. The story may be a retread, but at least Jamie Lee Curtis is fully committed to it once again. Her and her character are the best parts of this film and it isn't close.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

Twenty years later,Laurie is still having nightmares of her brother, has become an alcoholic which has affected her ability to be a better mother to her son John brother of the late Jamie Lloyd. The film has great performances by Adam Arkin who plays Laurie's loving boyfriend Will who seems to realize that Laurie may be hiding something of her past. Michelle Williams is also great as John's girlfriend Molly Cartwell who learns of John's maniac uncle. Nancy Stephens also returns in a cameo appearance as Marion Chambers the nurse of the late Sam Loomis who kept Laurie's identity a secret and is killed by Michael. I like the film finally has Laurie confront her demons to face her brother in the ultimate showdown. I think H20 is final chapter, and fans should disregard the disastrous Halloween Resurrection.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

In 1978 John Carpenter hit it big with his independent film with Halloween. But in 1981 we got a sequel that picks up right were the First one left off in Halloween II. Then in 1982 John Carpenter wanted to take the series in a different direction and make a different Halloween story every movie. With that we have the failed result known as Halloween III Season Of The Witch. So they decided to go back to the basics and in 1988 we got Halloween 4 The Return Of Michael Myers. After the financial success of Part 4 they wasted no time and a year later in 1989 we got Halloween 5 The Revenge Of Micheal Myers. After that no Halloween movie was heard of until in 1995 we got Halloween The Curse Of Micheal Myers. Box office ran big time with the movie and decided to put the Halloween series to rest for one more movie and in 1998 we got just that.The film follows Laurie Strode played once again by Jaimee Lee Curtis who is having nightmares about her serial killer brother Micheal Myers. Since then she has gone into hiding and has changed her name to Karen Tate and now has a job teaching at a high school were her son played by Josh Hartnett is enrolled. Her son and 3 of his friends decide to spend a night at the Myers house But Micheal shows up and havoc ensues with Lauri helping the kids of course.This is a very good entry in the famous horror series with terrific cast and great scares. Although the film drags on a few spots and Micheal Myers Doesn't really show up until an hour into the film which is stupid because A, the movie is about him and b, the movie is only 1hr 26min. This was supposed to be the final one but for some reason in 2002 we Got Halloween Resurrection With Busta Rhymes And Tyra Banks. Sadly(and I am being sarcastic here) I can't review that film because I shut it off halfway through. Whether It Was for better or for worst you decide on that one.

136,loomis78-815-989034,"More like ""Scream"" less like ""Halloween""",6,9 March 2014,"Starting 20 Years after the original night of terror, this sequel which ignores parts 4, 5 & 6 begins with an exciting pre-credit sequence that shows Michael Myers is alive and well. Myers (Chris Durand) has learned that his original target, Sister Laurie Strode (Curtis) has faked her death and moved to California. She is in hiding and going by the name Keri Tate. She is a headmistress of a private school that her 17 year old son John (Hartnett) attends. Laurie has become a functioning alcoholic and has never really recovered from her brother's original onslaught. Being over protective with her son is one of her problems and she denies him leaving for the upcoming Halloween weekend. John stays behind with three other friends as Laurie hopes for another peaceful Halloween. Myers travels to the school, slips in and begins his stalking of the kids, and Laurie and her love interest (Arkin). With Curtis involved and a treatment from ""Scream"" writer and Halloween fan Kevin Williamson, the producers even tried to bring John Carpenter in to direct but wound up with Steve Miner. The attempt was to bring this series back to respectability. In some ways it succeeded and in others it didn't. Ironically the ""Scream"" films were so heavily influenced by ""Halloween"" and this time H20 is more influenced by ""Scream"" than the series it is actually a sequel to. With Dimension on board, the poster design, pre-credit sequence, pacing, style and stupid August release date all shouted ""Scream"" not ""Halloween"". There are some nice moments like when Myers sneaks into the school and some of the end confrontation scenes with Laurie. It is fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie again but as H20 feels more like ""Scream"", Laurie is a little too JLC and her real personality than the Laurie from the earlier films. The cast is decent and there are good efforts at making this more classy and suspenseful than just a blood bath. But, for every attention to detail that fans of the series will like, there is a counter balance they won't. The most offending and ridiculous decision was to insert a generic ""Scream"" like score in place of Carpenter's Original music. The theme is used a few times but the nondescript music is like any other horror film from this time period. The producers also didn't pay attention to the Myers character at all. The mask is terrible, and stuntman Chris Durand Plods around walking fast like Ghostface not The Shape. Fans of the series will appreciate the effort but will more than likely be disappointed. Standard horror fans can enjoy some decent suspense and a few jumps and a pretty good modern slasher film. Die-hard fans of the series will say 'nice try'.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

The Curse of Thorn was the most worthless thing that has ever happen to any movie serial killer ever.  Thankfully, Jamie Lee Curtis is back and has changed her name from Lori Strode to Keri Tate.  She now has one son, Josh Hartnett, and works at the hillcrest academy and in the movie is dating Adam Arkin. After Michael dispatches of three people, he finds where Keri/Lori is and goes to Hillcrest just in time for the field trip.  To Michael's luck Keri/Lori, John, John's girlfriend, and a few more ill-fated people have decided to stay at the school.  Michael gets there, dispatches of a few victims, and is now against Lori/Keri.  The ending is pretty good, the acting is mostly well, and the body count is low.The acting in this movie is good enough.  Jamie Lee Curtis and Josh Hartnett has perfect chemistry and this is Josh Hartnett's movie debut.  Michelle Williams is very hot and kind of brings a Dawson's Creek vibe to the movie. Adam Hann-Byrd is a sex maniac in this and I enjoyed him a little bit.  Jodi Lynn O'Keefe is hot and her ending is good.  Adam Arkin is very well and I enjoyed him a lot.  LL Cool J plays a comic relief again and I enjoyed him again.  Overall this movie wasn't bad and I am VERY happy they got away from Thorn and went back to Jamie Lee Curtis.

141,happyendingrocks,Never trust a sequel that shares its title with the molecular composition of the Earth's most benign liquid,4,23 October 2009,"Anyone who has seen a horror film made since the 80's must be familiar with the ""false scare"" phenomenon. False scares are scenes where a character appears to be in peril, and then something or someone lunges out at them or grabs them, accompanied by a loud musical surge. For that brief flash, we're supposed to think that whatever antagonist the film is centered around has caught up with this character, but then it turns out that the ""something or someone"" is actually the character's boyfriend, an animal (usually a cat... okay, it's always a cat), or even an inanimate object (in the case of H20, an ironing board). Often there are a few false scares in the expository act of a horror movie which are designed to get the audience to jump prematurely, thus making them drop their guard for scenes later in the film where the ""someone or something"" that jumps out is actually whatever evil force the horror film is about.This device is used no less than 9 times in the first hour of H2O (that's roughly every 6 1/2 minutes, for those of your keeping score). This is a lot. For reference purposes, the number of times a false scare is utilized in the original Halloween is exactly zero. It's troubling that the writers of H2O had so few good ideas that they were forced to rely on this gimmick so many times, but what's even more disturbing is that there are no real scares to make the false ones pay off. At no time in the film does Michael Myers attack anyone without the film-makers first explicitly showing us exactly where he is and how close he is to offing the victim. The only thing missing from the rote, telegraphed murders in H2O is a counter in the corner of the screen telling us, ""Michael is going to stab this person in 5... 4... 3... 2... and... they're dead"". What this suggests is that the people who made Halloween: H2O genuinely believe that an ironing board is inherently more frightening than a knife-wielding, remorseless killing machine whom we have seen butcher at least 20 people up to this point. Clearly, this is not sound logic to build a horror film around.Despite being launched by the greatest horror movie of all time, the Halloween franchise has consistently offered the most disappointing succession of sequels the genre has ever known. Part II was decent if needless, but Part III didn't have anything to do with the series or Michael Myers, Parts 4 and 5 were wildly uneven, and Part 6: The Curse Of Michael Myers was so senseless that half the movie was scrubbed, re-shot, and molded into a shoddy and stupid film that was even more nonsensical than the one they scrapped (I've seen both versions, and the one they decided not to release is definitely superior than the one they did... but it still sucks).H20 wisely opts to pretend that nothing after Halloween II ever happened, which kind of gets it off to a good start by default. By bringing back Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, there is at least some effort to make the film a logical extension of the classic original. The details used to flesh out Strode's missing years are actually plausible and interesting, so we find ourselves rooting for her once again. That's pretty much where any potential enjoyment of H20 stops.The film is ponderously slow, spending more time establishing the relationship between Laurie and her son than it does building up to the inevitable showdown between her and Michael Myers. This lends itself to badly-written, over-dramatic exchanges of dialogue full of things that no one ever says in real life, such as a particularly inspired moment where Strode's 17 year-old son urges her to put her past behind her so that they can ""have a chance at some semblance of a happy existence"".We also spend way too much time on mindless comic relief, courtesy of LL Cool J, a useless character in the scheme of events whose only real contribution to the plot is that he later gets mistakenly shot in the head and multiple other places, and somehow survives without any damage except for a scratch on his cranium. Shockingly, someone thought that past-their-prime rappers were exactly what this struggling franchise needed, and Busta Rhymes would appear in the sequel after this one.There is an extended scene where Curtis listens to one of her female students expound on the significance of Doctor Frankenstein's confrontation with his monstrous creation in the timeless literary classic Frankenstein. While the writers of H2O probably thought they were making a clever point demonstrating that the Halloween franchise is simply a modern, urbanized version of an archetypal monster story, what this scene does instead is tell us exactly how this film is going to end. This also presents Laurie Strode as a woman stupid enough to confront a rampaging murderer who has killed almost everyone she's ever cared about, just because a teen-aged twit read some Mary Shelley Cliff Notes.The final frame of H2O is a doozie, and it's certainly a shocking and unexpected way to finish out the film. But any impact this scene has is immediately axed (get it?) once you know that there is at least one more sequel to come. This knowledge transforms one of H2O's only memorable moments into a guarantee that the next film is going to have to pretend it never happened.H2O isn't the worst film in the Halloween franchise, but it tries really hard to be. So you should at least admire the fact that it has aspirations. But that doesn't mean you should see it.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
142,Toronto85,Halloween H20: 20 Years Later,8,30 June 2013,"This seventh entry in the wonderfully eerie Halloween series brings back a familiar face in Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), and continues Michael Myers' killing spree on the dreaded holiday. 'Halloween H20' takes parts three through six and chucks them out the window, so we are supposed to forget all about the Jamie Lloyd storyline. We find out that Laurie Strode, after escaping the hospital massacre in 'Halloween II', faked her own death and went into hiding changing her name in the process to Keri Tate. It's twenty years later from that horrible Halloween night in 1978, and Laurie (now the head of a large school and with a teenage son) is feeling those old familiar feelings of fear. Fear that Michael is going to come after her and her child. Those fears are of course proved true as Michael tracks her down and slaughters EVERYTHING that gets in his way of killing his sister once and for all.Halloween H20 features quite the star studded cast. We get Curtis of course, but also Josh Hartnett, Michelle Williams, Janet Leigh and LL Cool J. So the acting in this one is safe to say better than the previous six films. I sort of liked the fact that H20 got away from the Thorn storyline in 'Halloween 6'. This film takes Myers back to his psychotic roots, makes it as though he is simply a madman. It's also great to see Laurie again after all these years, and watching her fight Michael again brought back lots of memories from the original films. There are a few murders in this one, but the number has definitely dropped from the previous sequels. Gore was well done, and the scares were plentiful. A flaw was the location/setting. It really lacked the same eerie atmosphere that only the desolate streets of Haddonfield could provide. Taking place in the giant school didn't do it for me, but 'Halloween H20' is a treat for any horror fan. It's great to see the scream queen Curtis back where she belongs, fighting Michael Myers.8/10 - Highly recommended!",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

Well, anyway, of course, it was not long before we got Halloween H20: 20 Years Later. Fans did not know what to expect after Halloween 6 with Donald Plesence dying during Halloween 6..then some big news was announced that Jamie Lee Curtis would return after four dragged on sequels. The film basically ignores 4-6 weirdly and follows Laurie Strode who has now become a teacher at a school and still suffers from nightmares of her encounter with Mr. Myers and soon certain events being to make her believe, hes back for her. I actually don't really have any problems with H20, the film is a superb sequel to Halloween, the film is actually better then Halloween 2 and has a awesome story after I did feel like Halloween 4-6's story of Laurie being the mom of Jamie and all that was a bit forced and felt a bit insane considering she was only like 25 if she did have her.

144,gabriel_sanchez,Family reunion...,4,16 July 2015,"OK, first of all, I want to warn that any spoiler ahead will be notified before it happens. So you guys can stay calm.I debated with myself if I should do a review with some spoilers and I came to the conclusion that I can't overlook some terrible flaws that happened.Though this movie is very cliché, I can't go full hating on it; actually, it's an OK movie. I mean, we all can agree that, by this point, Halloween series have been going on for far too long.All aspects of the series are here. It's basically the same as watching any other Halloween movie -- I'm fine with that, well, think about it: if you've gone this far on the series, you pretty much know what you're in for.But there were somethings in this movie that downgraded it's score for me.SPOILER #1: when Ronny is shot down, it's clear that the first shadow line you see it's from Michael Myers. Gosh, you can even see his knife in the shadow. I can't get over it. There's a line between fantasy cliché and nonsense... those things can ruin a movie. A movie has to have credibility.SPOILER #2: when Laurie is fleeing from Michael, right after Ronny's been shot down, she opens a door and sees it's a closet. Her hand has blood on it, so it leaves a bloody mark on the door. Micheal sees that and tries to enter the closet, which is now closed. Laurie appears from behind and knocks Michael down. Again: credibility. How was she able to lock the door like that if she wasn't inside the closet? The scene was fast and the movies does not mention at any point that she's caring any keys. And even if she was, like I said, it was fast, she couldn't have locked the closet and hidden from Michael that fast. One point down for you, movie!You can see this movie was all about Curtis. Also, it's just an excuse to put Laurie and Michael face to face again.Overall, it's just another Halloween movie.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
145,Gresh854,"Halloween: Simple, Popcorn-Fun Edition",5,2 July 2018,"Okay, wow. That was a lot better than the previous three Halloween movies. I wouldn't necessarily say Halloween H20: 20 Years Later was good, but it was certainly far from bad. What really prevailed this one from previous sequals were it's attempts to be more compelling which, for the most part, work fittingly. The dynamic relationship between Laurie Strode's character (it was so refreshing to see her back!) and her son John, really amplified the film's quality. It's worth noticing that we've been given a significantly improved and more mature screenplay compared to the four previous entries. However, the scares haven't truly improved, and suffers from leaving most of its trepidations up to cheap jump scares. It also suffers from trying to be more modernized and blockbuster-like, which is derivative because the element that made the first two Halloween movies special was their more claustrophobic and low-budgeted atmospheres. However, the final confrontation between Laurie and Michael was intoxicating and unbelievably satisfying. Despite its flaws and inability to break positive, new boundaries in the horror genre, I was still able to thoroughly relish this entry in the Halloween franchise.

She is still having nightmares about that terrible night, especially now that halloween 1998 is approaching, exactly 20 years later. Obviously, Michael didn't die and Laurie's fears are true: He has come back on halloween to start killing again.Can you think of a better setting? I can't.

Twenty years since Laurie Strode nearly saw her fate at the hands of her older brother. Not one to shy from celebrating an anniversary, Michael Myers dons his mask once again and tracks her down to southern California, where she has changed her name a forged a new life for herself, as well as raised a 17 year old son. Not believing what she sees until it's too late, Laurie finally works up the courage to face her fear, to lay her brother to rest before his reign of terror completely consumes her. Or kills her.""Halloween H20"" is the seventh film bearing the ""Halloween"" brand, but you wouldn't know it if you were keeping tabs on the plot. The fact is, the makers of this movie wanted to pretend this is the first sequel since 1981's ""Halloween II"" and, as a result, the events of parts 4 through 6 are forsaken, as well as -- to a lesser extent, ""Halloween III: Season Of The Witch."" Such has been the primary subject of countless debates for the better part of ten years amongst ""Halloween"" fans. It could be argued that it was a disservice to the late Donald Pleasence to ignore his work, or just a slap in the face to the fans of the films for forgetting about the beloved character of Jamie, portrayed by Danielle Harris. But nevermind series continuity, because this movie has bigger problems going for it.One of the biggest flaws in this film, noticeable to anyone paying enough attention, is the music. No, I'm not talking about that crummy Creed song that pops up twice during the film, but the replacement of John Ottman's Carpenter-inspired score for the music Marco Beltrami composed for 1996's ""Scream"". Somehow, watching the shape stalk his victims seems less effective when we have to endure the painful, updated-for-the-90's ""Psycho"" theme that reared it's ugly head in three other, separate films. It's hard to watch this movie, listening closely, and not expect Ghostface to lash out at Jamie Lee Curtis and friends. Also very ""Scream""-esque is both the writing and casting. The casting can be forgiven, though, as Josh Hartnett makes Laurie Strode's son, John, likable, and even an underused Michelle Williams is fair in her role. However, the plot of the story, and the overall tone, take a very dated turn. You might not know it, due to the fact that he goes uncredited, but Kevin Williamson (""Scream,"" ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"") had a heavy hand in the creation of this movie, and it is so painfully obvious, with the throwaway lines, cheesy references to other films and even a touch of teenage drama.The Williamson-curse, as I like to call it, taints an otherwise refreshing experience. Even as a fan of the sequels before it, I loved watching this film in theaters for the first time, with Jamie Lee Curtis making her triumphant return. Make no mistake, she does a superb job of resurrecting her signature role, and serves as the only person who could carry a ""Halloween"" film in the wake of Donald Pleasence's passing. Some of the supporting cast is sketchy, take for example, a smarmy Adam Arkin. But for the most part, it's a solid film. Director Steve Miner gives the movie an undeniably ""Halloween"" look, even with the bulk of the film taking place in California. The movie doesn't attempt to recreate the original to the fullest though, with some rather graphic violence that feels out of place in a sequel that is attempting to restore class to a sinking franchise. Fact of the matter is, ""Halloween H20"" is just another sequel. It might feel a little grander than any before it, but rarely does it rise above the slasher sequel stigma. I would say this film is almost problematic as the one before it -- even though it turned out a lot better -- as not only did they cut out an important part of the film -- the music -- but the mask was changed several times, so much so that they had to resort to using a really bad CGI mask for some scenes. But that's the main problem with an otherwise decent film. ""Halloween H20"" is conflicted. On one hand, it wants to be the intelligent companion piece to the original, but on the other, it's just another late-90's teen slasher. Worth the while, because it's an above average ""Halloween"" sequel, but don't kid yourself into thinking it's anything else.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
148,dormesher-21565,My favourite sequel,9,7 October 2018,"Halloween H20 my favourite sequel in the franchise (So Far) I love this movie it was the first Halloween I ever saw and it's the one that got me into the franchise it's always stuck with me and always very nostalgic.Bringing back Laurie Strode was a great idea and ignoring the other sequels was a great move for the franchise because as much as I love the Throne Trilogy the story really does get to complex and messed up for the Halloween franchise and this one was a great return to the basic formula of Halloween.However I do have some negatives with this one the score in this one isn't brilliant and is to grant which ruins the score should of kept to the simple John Carpenter original it works perfectly in the original.
Also using 4 different masks in this movie for Michael Myers was a stupid idea and they should of just stuck with one It gets really distracting on viewing and makes Myers less threatening in my opinion also that CGi mask they use looks like complete garbage.But that's it I love everything else in this movie the cast is brilliant Jamie Lee Curtis is once again a brilliant actress and Laurie Strode is such an interesting character to follow in this movie knowing everything she has been through and now trying to have a normal life but is struggling with it is such an interesting take on the character and makes it more realistic.
Josh Harnett is brilliant in the movie and this was one of the films I saw him in along with The Faculty he's always been a favourite of mine.The third act of this movie is incredible the fight between Laurie Strode and Michael Myers is amazing and the way she kills him at (or so we thought) was awesome and would of made a great ending to the entire Franchise she is such a bad ass character in this finally having enough and facing her evil once and for all.Favourite scene in the movie is when she first she's Michael for real and she realizes he is still alive seeing him through the door it was so awesome the shock on her face and the way Michael looks at her as if to say I finally found you just so awesome.Verdict 9/10 great sequel and always bean a nostalgic entry.

151,Meredith-7,"Watchable, but what was the point?",5,24 March 2000,"Having seen most of the Halloween films I thought that this might be just another additional to the already tired Michael Myers story.  It some ways it was fairly typical in approach, but this time they managed to bring back Jamie Lee Curtis.  I imagine that the viewer is meant to dismiss all the Halloween sequels and focus on the first, and connect it to the last ( we can only hope) installment.  Fairly standard as a slice and dice film goes, but there was the occassional scare.  The four young actors were better than you average teen actor - and they all seem to have gone onto bigger- although not necessarily better things.  I thought it was just really pointless, they could have gone more into the background of the relationship between Laurie Strode and Myers, besides just stating ""he is my brother"" - there really should have been more to it.  The opening was quite good, with some people dying in unusual ways - it seemed as if they were playing it very tongue in cheek- but then it seemed to get fairly serious for the rest of the film.  The few good things you can say about this film is that Curtis still knows how to scream, and it was better than all the other Halloween sequels.  The ending was kind of interesting (even if they didn't pull off everything they seemed to be trying to achieve in the last few scenes.)",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
152,FKDZ,The very best Halloween sequel so far.,8,1 November 2020,"I haven't felt excited to write a review after seeing a Halloween movie in a while now but wow finally we get a solid Halloween movie. The pacing, acting, directing is all just really good. There are some minor things here and there I don't like but overall this is my favorite Halloween sequel so far (chronologically).First off the movie already feels very different from the get-go, you can instantly notice the directing got a huge step up. Night and day compared with H6. The directing finally added a lot more suspense and overall creepiness to michael again. Now about michael, his mask is once again a bit different, and in general I think he looks good from mid-far distance but up close it just doesn't really do it for my like the original. It's slightly too sleek and in some specific shots looks a little painted on as well, like a lack of definition. That said it didn't annoy me that much.Second the music, solid all around and really loved that they used the main theme very strongly when Michael is getting close to Laurie towards the end of them movie. So it really made that moment a lot more memorable and just raised your interest a bit. Before that it was good, but not too interesting.The acting is great here, it really is fantastic to see Jamie LC back and she knocks it out of the park again. Additional the cast surrounding the film also does a good job, just in general nothing really felt off, and the writing definitely helped with that. As also the dialog and general story and writing of this movie is really solid. Much better than that cult storyline from previous films. This movie should've been H3 and not that ''thing'' they tried to sell as a Halloween movie.The introduction kills are also much better than any of the sequels. Aside from the kid going into a house with a live burglar being absolutely stupid, I mean it's not like people, especially criminals have guns or anything. So that was a bit unbelievable but the whole scene was shot well and ended wrapping up nicely.Overall this movie does have a bit less action or kills, and has a bit more suspense building like the original. I especially like the bathroom scene where michael decides not to kill for once, it's always been so predictable so the change was nice. One of the best kills has got to be the girlfriend who gets here leg stuck in the kitchen elevator. Wow that is one gruesome scene. The actual kill (stabbing) was a bit more tame, but the whole sequence was the best in the whole film. In general though the other kills are okay, not that there are many either.But even though this movie didn't have a lot of killing, it still had a nice pacing , Jamie LC is back and the story is back to normal, I was a lot more interested again and time flew by.The finale is overall really good, great chase with solid smart thinking of Laurie, and it was so good to finally see her hit back, no stupid decisions just a really solid and suspenseful finale. it was a bit odd though that John just kinda disappeared (with his gf), I guess the movie didn't want them in those scenes, Imo it would've been better for John to be the person to stop Laurie instead of the fake out death of the security guard. That said we do get to see John at the end again and his gf so they are definitely okay.Laurie's final confrontation was great with Michael. First her overconfidence throwing them both off the cliff, the manipulation from Michael to grab her hand.... and then the shocking decapitation of Michael felt which SO good. And a really good end to Michael. Sadly though not the end for the franchise with Resurrection but oh well.8/10. To me one of the most enjoyable and well made Halloween sequels thus far into the franchise.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

Halloween H20 is the only good Halloween sequel after Halloween 2 in my opinion. The first half is a little slow, but things soon pick up in the second half and climax with a fantastic ending. Jamie Lee has really improved her acting skills since the original Halloween, and I love the way she decides she's had enough of fearing Michael and takes him on. A lot of similar tricks to the original Halloween are used, such as seeing Michael Myers one minute, then him disappearing the next. You also get to understand how he will stop at nothing to kill his sister, as he holds his hand out at the end, trying to trick her. This film would have been a perfect closure to the Halloween franchise, but sadly they had try and milk more money by making another sequel. In my opinion, there are only 3 'true' Halloween films - the original, Halloween 2, and this one. That's because they all have Jamie Lee in, and without her, Haloween is just mindless slasher fodder.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
154,LanceBrave,Laurie Strode on the Offensive,7,5 November 2013,"After the extended mess that was ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers,"" it was clear that the franchise needed some fresh-blood if it expected to continue. A problem facing that sequel especially, and really all the sequels, is that Michael Myers is not a particularly captivating character. When faithful to the original, he's not a character at all but rather the absence of character. It really isn't much of a surprise that Dr. Loomis, Michael Myers' arch-enemy, was the most interesting part about most of the sequels. ""Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later"" understands this. It attempts to return the series to its roots, revitalizes the limp franchise, while also providing Myers with a captivating opponent: His first, Laurie Strode, Jaime Lee Curtis returning to the series that made her a star.Picking up twenty years after the original, Laurie Strobe has moved far away from Haddonfield, faked her death, and created a new life for herself. She is now Keri Tate, a head teacher at Hillcrest Academy, a fancy private school. She has a boyfriend in the school guidance counselor and even a son from a previous marriage, seventeen year old John. Laurie is still suffering from the events of that night, having nightmares and seeing brother Michael everywhere. Her trauma, and her subsequent alcoholism, has put a stern on her relationship with her son. Of course, Michael isn't dead. He tracks his sister down, targets her child, forcing a final confrontation between the two.""Halloween H20,"" which is honestly a kind of weird title, is the first ""Halloween"" film to be made in the wake of ""Scream,"" the movie that revitalized the slasher subgenre. This is all to obvious at times, especially since Kevin Williamson's name is there in the credits. The young cast members are super-model sexy, many of them recruited from popular television series. The visuals are far more slick and polished then ever before. There are a few times when Myers is getting knocked around by skinny women that remind me of Ghostface. ""Scream 2"" is even shown on TV at one point. There's a general referential tone, not just to the series' history but also to horror in general. Dr. Loomis' ""Blackest Eyes"" speech plays over the opening credits, ""Mr. Sandman"" gets played a few times, classic dialogue is reprised, Laurie gets slashed in the shoulder and Michael gets knocked over a railing. Myers' lifts a victim up with a blade, a female student notices the killer through a window while in class, and bloody scissors make a prominent appearance. There are other horror references, most blatantly to ""Psycho,"" with Janet Leigh having a bit part. This is a little too cute, especially when Leigh's character asks to be maternal and walks away to a reprise of the ""Psycho"" theme! The early-going parts of ""H20"" feel very much like what you'd expect a ""Halloween"" sequel in 1998 to be like. Myers does his thing, slashing throats and stabbing backs with a big butcher knife. Perhaps attempting to capture that classic spirit, the movie double-downs on Michael leaving his victim's bodies in unexpected places. The movie, at least, feels simultaneously more and less brutal then previous sequels. The kills themselves aren't particularly cruel but there's heavy focus on stab wounds and shattering bones. A leg crushed in a dumb-waiter is especially squirm-inducing. Michael either teleports a few times or climbs stairs really quickly. The Shape hacking teens outside of Haddonfield feels a little weird and I can't say the private school setting works for me. The killer first thinks to stick his hand through the bars of a gate and then pick up the keys. The slasher elements are decent without being anything special.What elevates ""Halloween H20"" above the other sequels is Jaime Lee Curtis' participation. While the first half is filled with cheap jump scares, Marco Beltrami's overly flowery score blaring far too much, the focus is squarely on Laurie's still reeling mental state. A confession to her boyfriend is a stand-out scene, Curtis bringing her matured talent to the role. After shipping her kids off to safely, Laurie Strobe smashes the gate control and grabs a fire axe. This is the Laurie Strode we know, a determined survivor, but this time she's on the offensive. The last half-hour of ""H20"" is excellent, Laurie and Michael struggling for survival. The two beat the snot out of each other. A moment where Laurie hides under tables while the Shape flips them over generates some decent suspense. After downing Myers, Laurie realizes that he's not dead at all. The final ten minutes are action-packed and deeply suspenseful. The finale is intriguing. Pinned between a tree and a slipped van, Michael Myers looks around confused, holding his head. He reaches a hand out to Laurie, his humanity seemingly returned for the first time in two decades. Laurie doesn't buy it. The climatic decapitation is deeply satisfying, finally providing closure to the long-running series.Steve Miner, director of fan-favorite horror flicks like ""Friday the 13th Part II,"" ""Friday the 13th Part III"" and, uh, ""Lake Placid,"" contributes some above-average direction. I like the billowing curtains a lot. LL Cool J's role as a security guard/would-be romance novelist is a relatively annoying character. I like how tall and lanky Myers is but the mask needs a little work. His eyes are too visible and the mask has too lines on it. ""H20"" has an uneasy relationship with the series' continuity. Officially, this film ignores parts four through six. However, it's pretty easy to think up a connection, as long as you ignore Laurie abandoning her daughter. Though very much a product of 1998, ""Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later"" is definitely a stronger sequel. If it had been the last ""Halloween"" film, I would have been perfectly happy with that.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

Anyway, the movie reunites Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, and her brother Michael Myers. Jamie Lee Curtis is now living in California tormented by memories of what happened in the past. Little does she know, Mike is alive, little does he know, so is she. She is the head mistress of a school, where her 17 year old son goes (Josh Hartnett). Michael decides to show up, and give a little company to her son, killing him....he's 17, get the gist?

160,refinedsugar,The Series Is Sinking,3,31 July 2000,"I feel sorry for people who liked this. Series fans or not. This is a pretty sad horror flick. Jamie Lee Curtis might have returned to the grounds that started her career, but she hasn't returned to much. I'll go as far to say that her return is the only thing this movie has going for it and it's only real highlight. Even if her character is far from sympathetic.Which itself is one of the flick's key problems. None of the characters featured are particularly likable. How can they be? They're not written that deeply. In particular, you have to be sympathetic towards the main character in a horror movie otherwise you start to wonder if you're caught watching a long running horror franchise degrade itself making sequels so fans can cheer the familiar villain. The Friday the 13th series did it. Nightmare In Elm Street devolved into it. Maybe now it's Halloween's turn. It's 1998 and after two botched sequels the cardinal rule of lesser returns is in full effect for the Halloween series.H20 is flat. Moving very slowly it clocks in at a paltry eighty-six minutes. Now you could rightfully expect the bulk of the story to have been the whole Michael Myers / Laurie Strode match up. Brother - sister - twenty years later - but no. They pad out the story with a bunch of teenage nothingness circled around Laurie's son and his friends at a private prep school in California. If you can't spot the problems with that description belonging to a Halloween movie, I don't know what to tell you. While other sequels in the series (particularly H5) have done the whole teenage element, it took H20 to do it in such a boring yet blatantly copied style. Being totally blunt, Scream and its run off success has done a lot of harm to the horror genre and H20 is a blatant product of that. In a bid to make money and be successful, H20 emulates the style wherever possible. A dismal sequel to a series I've enjoyed over the years is one thing, but knowing its being fed by the scraps of the profitable Scream franchise makes it all the more unbearable. Distributed, produced, partly written and musically scored from people ripped right from the Scream movies this isn't so much a Halloween sequel as a wannabe riding the financial coat tails.Even if you manage to look past this - nothing ever feels like it really clicks together in a cohesive satisfying manner. At least not in the way a Halloween movie should feel. Possibly because outside of the classic characters of Laurie Strode and Michael Myers, this isn't really a Halloween movie much less a proper sequel. The level of atmosphere is sad with almost no suspense or proper pacing under Steve Miner director of such gems as Friday The 13th II & III.The fact of the matter is change is never good when you're dealing with a horror series. Minor deviations are viewed as acceptable to keep things 'fresh' albeit for the most stringiest of hardcore fans, but when you rewrite things already written in stone or change the fabric of what people have come to know and love you are in deep trouble. Fans rejoice in the knowledge that not much has changed from the original or last sequel. There's a reassurance that things are the same as they've always been. Fans fear change and this movie had a massive amount of change to the Halloween series format.First of all, there's no Haddonfield. Big mistake. In my eyes shifting locations when they play such a big part in the story and atmosphere is just asking for problems and in no way, shape or form does a private school in California have the same eerie atmospheric vibe that Haddonfield, Illinois did. Then of course there is no Donald Pleasence. The backbone of the series for the extended middle. He is sorely missed. Of course that was rendered meaningless with a double time line was created. Some bright bulb thought it would be a good idea to forget H2-H6 for the sake of H20's plot. A convenient way to ""erase"" their mistakes (a.k.a. bad sequels) it also allowed them to start fresh story wise leaving all the mess behind - not having to connect or explain anything - and conveniently bring in JLC and in short stride keep the series going and rake in dollars. Even today I question how any self-respecting fan of the series could put up with this. Only people with heavy disdain or hatred for H4 thru H6 can justify this and at that point if they hate those sequels so much, how exactly are they fans of the series? Mind-boggling.Saying anything else only further justifies how much of a train wreck ""Halloween: Twenty Years later"" really is. A late summer release date for a HALLOWEEN movie. A production that went back for re-shooting (always a positive sign). A rushed release date that results in John Ottman's score being slashed. A rash of errors including the mask that keeps changing. Way too many cheap, false scares. Another flat Michael Myers performance ... the list goes on and on. Sure the movie has a higher budget than any of the previous Halloween sequels put together, but where the heck did it go? It certainly didn't end up on the screen. It went straight into JLC's pocket and the movie's huge marketing campaign. I can understand quite well why Debra Hill & John Carpenter didn't become associated with this ""anniversary"" mess. It's the sixth sequel in the series and it stinks. To think here we were as fans thinking it couldn't get any worse than the mishaps of H5 & H6 and then H20 came along. It's a long road back from here.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
161,RickHarvey,average,6,26 November 2009,"What this? an Halloween film being made to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the original, which stars Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode again. Sounds great. Well it does sound great but it not, it mediocre. I loved the Halloween franchise when i was 11 years old but after watching the whole series again, it quite bad. Only the first two are worth watching. Anyway let me say that H20 is an OK film. The opening is great despite the annoying guy with the hockey stick who comes up with stupid lines. In fact, the opening is brilliant. The opening titles are great with the voice over of the famous speech by Dr loomis. If his voice sounds different then it because it not Donald Pleasance but instead someone totally different. There are some many spooky scenes. One being the toilet scene, very creepy and the memories coming back to haunt Strode. It also great to see Josh Harnett star as the main male. It about time we get an decent cast for an horror. Rather than honouring the original Halloween, it seems H20 wants to honour Psyhco instead. there are lines thrown out which references the 1960 classic. Even Janet Leigh plays a role , heck even the car she drove in the classic has an small cameo. No complaints as Psycho was John Carpenters aspiration.What spoils the film are the deaths. Halloween 4 to 6 were filled with over the top deaths that made the film cheesy. so it good that in H20 the deaths are believable. killer has knife, killer kills with knife. The way the original was. no more chucking power plant man in the air or poking thumbs in someones head. But unfortunately the execution is poor in H20. in fact there no memorable deaths , only the last one ( in an bad way ). Another problem is Michael himself. it annoying that he changes in every film. Not small changes but big ones . His body is either tall and wide or small and thin. His mask always changes , they get worse every film . The man's 41 years old but with every film that goes by , the mask seems to make him younger. It annoys me very much. You can't relate to the killer as one person when his appearance dramatically changes in every film. if only they had the luxury of having an dedicated actor to play the role just like Robert Englund as Freddy.The final death was ridiculous. It just seems out of place. He should never be killed. the ending becomes more of an joke when you watch the eight Halloween. This is an average slasher that doesn't give the Halloween series any justice. it feels empty and doesn't feel like an Halloween film.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

163,shaun98,"Well, at least Jamie Lee's good",5,28 April 2002,"[minor spoiler]
Well, it was inevitable. As we've all feared, the ""Halloween"" franchise has transformed into yet another ""teeny-bopper"" horror series. The seventh installment features hot young actors from the WB network, usually an indication of a ""trendy"" horror movie. Plus, it was made with the involvement of none other than Kevin Williamson, writer of ""Scream"" and executive producer of ""Dawson's Creek."" All signs of an impending disaster. Well, not quite, at least not this time, but it's still a long cry from John Carpenter's treatment of the same material. Even Michael Myers himself isn't very scary anymore. It's a relatively minor point, but I was distracted by the fact that his eyes were visible. Sorry, but it's just not the same.Yet, all is not lost. Jamie Lee Curtis, reprising the Laurie Strode character, is a terrific lead. She adds an air of credibility to a watered-down formula, at times even making it close to respectable. Her character, as portrayed, is probably an accurate representation of how Laurie would have changed in twenty years' worth. The young supporting cast does a decent job, given the circumstances. At least they're much more sympathetic than most of their counterparts in similar films. However, LL Cool J is burdened with the most thankless role, as a loudmouthed security guard. His miraculous recovery after an encounter with Michael is a major groaner, probably a medical impossibility.At the very least, ""H2O"" provides a sense of closure, very rare in a horror series. However, yet another sequel is on the way. Based on what I've heard, I think we will have a disaster on our hands next time. At the very best, it will be an instantly forgettable, generic teen slasher. Curtis has reportedly expressed her unhappiness with it from the start, only appearing in it to fulfill her contract.

Well, I just saw it again on cable.It starts off fabulously, with the nurse from the original reprising her role (briefly).  Then the haunted voice of Donald Pleasance over the credits.  Then....a whole lot of nothing.  Where was Michael this whole time if Parts II-6 never existed? How did he drive from Illinois to California in a day with nobody seeing him? (Hmmm, creepy guy in mask crossing the Rockies in ugly, dilapidated vehicle?  Nah, I'd never notice him.) How did Michael know that Laurie has a son who turned 17 two months ago?I'm willing to forget all of this if something - anything! - happened in the middle hour.  Instead of mystery, suspense, a visual flair, or character development, there's distracted references to Scream 2 and Psycho (which was still pretty cool, though), a pointless corkscrew-in-the-sink-with-a-hand-reaching-in segment, and a couple of unimaginative deaths.The best moment comes at the very end, with Laurie, an ax, and a shiver.  I couldn't ask for a better conclusion; very chilling and appropriate (and it means they'll be no more sequels, I hope).  And there are a few other moments that are worth seeing, like Laurie and Michael face-to-face again with only a window separating them and Laurie/Jamie's first scream (waking up from a nightmare)...needless to say, Jamie Lee is the best thing about this movie, and I will always respect her for agreeing to give props to the genre that made her a star.But, come on!  Michael's mask looks NOTHING like it should, he's not the same body type as previously, and, the biggest insult of them all: LL's third act resurrection.

I had heard that there was a writer who wanted to tie all the loose ends up in this movie, including the plots in 4-6. However, there were no actual references to 4-6 in this movie, which is understandable as 5-6 were a mess, and the producers wanted to return to form. Michelle Williams and Josh Hartnett give credible performances, while Adam Arkin is rather wasted. It was nice seeing Nancy Stephens in her small role.

One of the clippings that stands out is the article about how Laurie Strode, a survivor of the Halloween murders, died in a mysterious car accident. Obviously the accident was staged and Laurie has been placed in the Witness Relocation program.  The file that was stolen was obviously a file that revealed her current location.  So Michael goes tracking her down, where she is now a school principal in Northern California. And its Halloween!The only thing wrong with this movie was that according to htis film Halloween 4,5,6 never took place.  It would have made more sense if it did. So Laurie is living in terror that he might discover that she is till alive and try to find her.  Plus, it could have helped with character development. The movie makes reference to Frankenstein and how the main character needed to overcome thier fears because they were the only one who could the monster.

A bunch of stupid teenagers (Hartnett should be the killer as he really knows how to suck the life out a movie) running around, trying not to get killed. It's nice, however, to see that they've included one of my all-time favourite plot holes (also featured in The Haunting) where part of the action is dependent on the fact that the characters can't climb an 8 feet fence.

In my opinion, ""Halloween II"" and ""Halloween H20"" are the series' strongest sequels.Bottom line, if you're looking for an entertaining horror flick with a fast paced storyline and actual good actors for a change, this one's for you.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
173,Minus_The_Beer,"""H20"" is a Watered Down Reboot of a Troubled Franchise",7,28 September 2010,"The twentieth-year anniversary of John Carpenter's seminal slasher opus, ""Halloween,"" finds original star Jamie Lee Curtis once again facing off against her arch-nemesis: Michael Myers. Set exactly twenty years following the events of ""Halloween II,"" ""Halloween H20"" ignores the three installments preceding it. That means no Jamie Lloyd, no wacky cult subplot and no mysterious man in black.In this reboot of sorts, Laurie Strode has faked her own death, fleeing to California where she works as a private school teacher. Wrestling with her demons, she struggles with blatant alcoholism while trying to raise her resentful teenage son, John (Josh Hartnett). Things eventually come to a head when Michael plans a family reunion of sorts and follows her cross-country, engaging her in one last (?) game of cat and mouse.While ""Halloween H20"" tries its hardest to restore order to a franchise that had gotten more and more convoluted with each subsequent installment, it can't help but succumb to some problems of its own. Capitalizing on the teen-slasher boom of the late 90's, the seventh film in the long-standing franchise opts to pay tribute to Wes Craven's ""Scream"" in more ways than one. From its cheeky self-referential script penned by ""Scream"" writer Kevin Williamson, to its recycled score by Marco Beltrami and its casting of hip and hot WB stars, this film reeks of late 90's teen slasher. While ""Scream"" itself paid homage to the original ""Halloween"" in clever ways, the reverse treatment given by ""H20"" is not only premature but serves to date the film horribly as well.It's not all bad news for the film, though. Jamie Lee Curtis is in top form here, portraying the on-the-edge version of Laurie Strode as naturally and believably as she did the sweet and innocent girl next door decades before. Her final showdown against Myers can only be summed up as epic and is the saving grace of the entire film. This final act is jam-packed with suspense and emotion, and it's all thanks to Curtis's fiery performance. Supporting roles from LL Cool J and Adam Arkin are adequate, while a young Josh Hartnett cuts his teeth on a potentially juicy but ultimately one-dimensional character.Director Steve Miner made his bones in the 80's directing two ""Friday the 13th"" sequels as well as the semi-cult classic, ""House,"" so it should come as no surprise that he does an adequate job with his take on the Myers saga. While he's no John Carpenter, Miner does his best to bring the expected suspense and drama to the table, and even when it's obvious that the studio undercut him in more than a few ways (what's up with that CGI mask?) he still manages to provide significant class and closure to a floundering franchise.In the end, ""Halloween H20"" is hardly a perfect film. It's arguably better than the two films before it, but hardly lives up the original film or even its sequel. Fans will rejoice in seeing Jamie Lee Curtis back to the genre and hellbent on revenge, especially in the film's final moments. Unfortunately, the rest is just so painfully average and sanitized that it renders itself ineffective as a companion-piece to John Carpenter's masterpiece and plays more as a sign of the times. What could have truly been a grand cinematic event for horror nuts is instead yet another teen slasher flick, albeit one that's a slight notch above the rest.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

This film the so called twenty year reunion of the slayer of teens Michael Myers was sold as a film that would be awesome and reflect on the past success's of the series. Yeah, I guess it did that if you only count part one as a success. This film totally forged over the previous three films and said they do not exist and it tampered with the time line of Halloween II. How could this happen? Me a kid who grew up on all six of the original Halloweens and to me there are still only six this was a sin against man kind. This film being made opened my eyes up to the fact that no one cares anymore. This film that shows that no one cares about the fans. It shows that the studios are to stupid to realize that Michael Myeres had a great thing going with the Thorn story line and that should have been pushed further. But no for moneys sake we were given a pop glam WB, UPN interpretation of what a horror film should be for ignorant kids who don't know what came before. Who cares if the local star quarter back from your foot ball team can understand a Halloween movie. Odds are as in the case of my local team there not even at the theater on opening night as they are out doing there rite of stupid passage on the football fields of America. They only way they would ever see a Halloween movie is if there dumb teeny bop per girlfriends made them watch a copy on home video. The fans are the ones who made this film a success at the box office not those idiots and we should be rewarded with are Thorn story line for paying your kids way through college. Boycott this movie. Never watch it.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
175,piratecannon,The Third Best of the Series,7,27 December 2012,"Halloween: H20 is a good movie. Actually, it's a darn good movie. It's not perfect by any means, but it is about as perfect as one could hope for in terms of a follow up to the original films (yes, I count Halloween 1 & 2 as existing as one continuous story, and, thus, movie). The screenwriters involved did what should have been done many, many years ago; specifically, they write Jamie Lee Curtis back into the narrative as our lead protagonist.The story goes like this: twenty years after the events of Halloween, Laurie Strode (Curtis), Michael Myers' sister who's been long presumed dead, is, in fact, alive and well in rural California. She's entered a witness protection program of sorts, having changed her name to Keri Tate and taken a job as the Headmistress at a private high school. Understandably, Laurie has in no way shaken the trauma that's enveloped her since her brother's attempt on her life. She's an alcoholic who barely maintains a semblance of sanity on the surface. When she's not drinking, she's popping a cornucopia of pills to try and quell the horrific nightmares that she endures on a regular basis. She also has a seventeen year old son, played by Josh Hartnett. The kid's a smart- mouthed pretty boy who doesn't understand his mother's insistence that he always be on his guard lest Michael make an unlikely appearance. The rest of the cast is solid, too, with L.L. Cool J rounding out the list as comic relief.After Loomis' death, Michael visit's his psychologist/caretaker's home (in what we assume is an attempt to make sure that he's snuffed out his totally snuffed out his family). Lo and behold, he discovers that Laurie is alive and well by gaining access to a file folder that details her whereabouts, occupation, etc. After trekking cross-country, Michael finally comes face to face with his long lost sibling, and that's when the mayhem finally shifts into overdrive.If I have any complaints about the movie, it's that it actually feels a little too rushed from time to time. I would have liked Miner and company to have more thoroughly probed the extent of Strode's mental ailings, and it would have been nice to have the actual ""horror/action"" have a little more screen time. As it is, Michael kills the obligatory teens that stand in his way, but there's a clichéd taste about several of the moments that make the movie feel a little too familiar. The title is problematic, too. H20? Why not just called it Halloween: 20 Years Later? Doesn't that make more sense? Every time I see it printed somewhere it makes me think of water, and I seriously doubt that was the filmmakers' intent.That said, it's my conclusion that H20 is the third best movie in the series. It's actually more enjoyable than Halloween II in some ways. Much of this has to do with Curtis' more well-developed character, the no frills directorial style, and the intelligence of the plot (something that's sorely missing from the franchise's direct predecessors). If you've skipped it for whatever reason and are a fan of the series, do yourself a solid and check it out. H20 stands out as an unexpected gem in a series that's had its fair share of low points.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

Well Michael finds her through a worker of Dr. Loomis (steals some documents) and heads towards the school to finish what he started 20 years ago. What follows is an excellent film, with a few frights and some great killings. Michael has everything thrown at him to try and stop him. A great performance by Jamie Lee Curtis, a great music score that helps set the scene for a spooky atmosphere.

As is the ending, where Michael Myers's tendancy to return to life is played out to great effect.Featuring an excellent tongue-in-mouth scene featuring Janet Leigh (Jamie's mother and star of the INFAMOUS shower scene in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"") and her car!!Perhaps the major problem with this movie is that it's a little too short for its own good, and the body count is rather low, despite the possibilities created by the three-deaths-before-the-opening-credits-roll opening scene. In spite of this, this is a refreshing slasher sequel.And forget questions like, Why did he wait 20 years to comer after her? After all, as Curtis points out, in the original he waited 15 years!

181,CowherPowerForever,"I Met This Six-Year-Old Child, With This Blank, Pale, Emotionless Face and The Blackest Eyes... The Devil's Eyes.",7,25 October 2014,"The following review will contain spoilers.Halloween: H20 is basically a film that ignores Halloween 4, Halloween 5, and Halloween 6. It it a sequel to Halloween 2, and takes place 20 years after the events of the original storyline which covers Halloween 1 and Halloween 2. While I really enjoy what they did with Halloween 4 for the most part, I do agree ignoring the Thorn storyline in Halloween 5 and Halloween 6 was needed. While this is not my favorite of the Halloween movies, it certainly it not one of the worst. The following is my review of Halloween: H20.The movie was written by Matt Greenberg and Robert Zappia. The story itself is very good considering they were able to skip over some of the recent barely above average films, that went into some odd story lines. The film starts almost exactly 20 years after the events of Halloween 1 & 2. We first see Marion Chambers from Halloween 1 & 2 go into her home in Langdon, Illinois just 2 days before Halloween. Her home has been broken into, so she goes into the neighbors house to call the police. The teenage neighbors offer to go look in her house before the police show up, and they end up finding nothing. She goes into her office to find that documents on Laurie Strode are missing. This is where Michael Myers returns to kill her, since he already has killed the neighbors. The police show up as she is back over at the neighbors house where Michael has killed both teenagers. Michael does kill her and the opening montage of the film starts off explaining some of what has happened. Laurie supposedly died in a car accident(much like from the Halloween 4 storyline). We find that she has faked her death and is now teaching at a boarding school in California. Considering this story is a sort of reboot, ignoring the past three films in favor of returning to the basic story with Laurie, I must say I enjoy what they came up with. I also enjoy the nice nod to Halloween 4 which also uses the piece that Laurie dies in a car accident. Overall, the story is not original by any means, but I still find it enjoyable.The film was directed by Steve Miner who is well known in the horror genre for his work on some of the Friday the 13th films in the 1980s. I frankly still consider this to be one of the worst decisions for director of this franchise. Steve is a great director, and I personally love what he did with Friday the 13th, but those two franchises are completely different in tone. On one side(Friday the 13th) is a slasher molded series, while the other (Halloween) is a more use your imagination type of series. While Halloween has differed in the past in that regard, the underlying feel should be less slasher material. Miner doesn't do that here, and thus it fails in my opinion. There is not an overload of gore and over the top deaths, but two of the deaths pushed things to the extreme in my opinion. On a brighter note, Jamie Lee Curtis decided it was the correct time to come back to the franchise, and it was much needed. The previous three films were held together acting wise because of the legend Donald Pleasence, and with him deceased when this idea hit, Jamie Lee Curtis was the best option to bring back. She is a joy to watch, even if the film is 20 years after the original. The rest of the acting is pretty bland, and we shouldn't expect much more. Although Jamie's mother(Janet Leigh) makes an appearance in the film as her secretary, which was something great to see. I don't hate Steve Miner for his work in this film, but I do think because of his work on a more slasher orientated character, that hurt him here in this film in some death scenes. However, I do enjoy the movie, and he deserves some credit for bringing the film to light.The film was scored by John Ottman, who wanted a more orchestra approach to the score, and thus in some areas of the film, the score suffers. The score was redone right before the film was released by composer Marco Beltrami. While his effort in the scenes he does is not perfect by any stretch of the meaning, overall his score was better than Ottman's. The film still carries some of the aspects from the original score by John Carpenter, but suffers in certain areas because they wanted to be different. Not the best Halloween score, and not the worst.Overall, Halloween: H20 brought back a more civil storyline to a franchise that was very much in need of it. Some of the death scenes are too much of slasher sub-genre deaths for my liking, but for the most part the film continues the tradition of bringing scares instead of too much blood and guts. Some purists consider this to be the last film of only three Halloween movies, along with the original Halloween and Halloween 2. While I disagree, I enjoy nearly all of them, this is a nice fitting story to come back to after some of the previous bad stories. Those on the fence should not ignore this film, as it is one of the better sequels in the franchise.7/10",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

183,BlueSkies765,Mr. Sandman,8,20 September 2020,"One thing that will probably make people like or not like the movie is Laurie Strode's struggle throughout the movie. Yes, it was definitely needed to advance the story, but can be viewed as a bore by Halloween fans who need to wait for a significant chunk of the movie to see some real action. The thing with this part is that Dr. Loomis isn't in the movie. In the original there were enough moments to switch between interesting characters. Like Loomis just being in the Meyers house and just talking about Michael was creepy. Also a great portion of the movie takes place at night. This created an aura of menace like Michael's presence was always there.Also a thing that might not be appreciated by everyone, is that this movie for the most part takes place during the day in a school environment. Relying on jump scares to keep the audience engaged. A bit of a Nickelodeon feel to it. Seems like lot of horror movies in 1998 some school environment played a role. This movie can be compared most to the 2018 version with the difference that the 2018 version is much more brutal in its violence, a bit of Rob Zombie style of Halloween. While this version feels closer to the older versions. I do think that the 2018 version was more successful in adding more suspense in between Laurie's struggle to keep me engaged. Something that I felt was lacking in this movie. However I do feel the showdown between Laurie and Michael was epic so it was still worth the watch.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

The new terror of Michael Myers including his 17th years old nephew, John (Josh Hartnett, on his film debut) and his girlfriend, Molly (Michelle Williams). In a pulsing finale, Laurie Strode manages her vengeance. 
H20 definitely is the best of all of the series. Steve Miner (Friday the 13th 2 & 3, Lake Placid, Dawson's Creek) succeeds to bring the most ambitious sequel in the series. The reunion between Laurie and Michael is superb. The pace is dynamic, the score is great, and the visualization of the scene is superb. The plot it self is somewhat brief but well packed and effective to the movie and also gives a good credit to it. Jamie Lee Curtis is still so great. With the special performance with Janet Leigh (Psycho), her real life mother, also makes a certain plus credit.
After the succeed of Kevin Williamson and his Scream franchise, made the producers took a good step to make a new approach to the series with the touch of the posh modern style on it.

186,scott-sw,Works as a decent homage ... but not so good.,5,4 January 2008,"Halloween H20 was one of those movies I initially enjoyed, but when reflecting on it, I liked it less. Jamie Lee Curtis finally returns to her role as Laurie Strode to finish the story begun by the low budget Halloween directed by John Carpenter. It is 20 years later, and no one has found Michael Myers. Moreover, Laurie has had some mental problems over the ordeal. It has resulted in a divorce, heavy medication, and occasional use of alcohol. She moved to California where she is the head mistress of a school. There, many kids are going off for the fall break, except a few to have a Halloween party. One of those is Laurie's son, played by Heath Ledger. Guess who crashes their Halloween party? For the record, producers ignored Halloween 3, 4, 5, and 6 in order to make this one. Frankly, when producers or writers do this, it usually reveals a lack of imagination or talent. But then again, sometimes you have to ... as in the case of Highlander 2. Back to Halloween H20. Frankly, it worked good as an homage to the 1978 cult classic. What it lacks is a good story, motivation, and plot. Sure, Curtis is great, and so is her exchange with mother Janet Leigh (of Psycho). Her characterization is great as well. However, the Shape seems bored even for a psychopath. Moreover, the director merely mimics the John Carpenter style without giving us any good scares or tension. There are also too many lol's, what I call lapses of logic. First, what has Michael Myers been doing for the last 20 years? Shouldn't his mask be tattered and torn? How did he eat? Where did he live? Ultimately, how can he see since Laurie shot his eyes out at point blank range in Halloween II? Finally, for some bizarre reason, Halloween H20 was released in July. Apparently they did not want to compete with a new Child's Play sequel. When a movie named for a certain holiday does not compete on that holiday, it makes you wonder why producers and marketers did this. It is obvious the makers of this one merely wanted homage to a classic. Perhaps if they were bent on making a real movie, it might have been better.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

194,Phantasm01,Good sequel,8,2 August 2006,"Director Steve Miner (""Friday the 13th, Part III"", ""Forever Young"") uses his similar, stylish tactics of his early 1980's ""Friday the 13th"" thrillers in this exceptional sequel. Now twenty years after the original Halloweens took place (basically forgetting sequels 3-6, thank God), Michael Myers returns to inflict even more terror on Laurie (reprised by scream-queen Jamie Lee Curtis in a fine performance). Laurie struggles to put the fear of Michael away, even after two decades have passes since that dreadful night her deranged brother returned to Haddonfield, Illinois to kill her.An alcoholic headmistress of her graduating son's (played by Josh Hartnett) private school, Laurie dreads the upcoming infamous fall holiday. With the support from love interest Arkin (""Chicago Hope""), Laurie is coerced to believe that nothing bad is going to happen--until the dead bodies start to pile up. As Laurie attempts to save her son from the horrific monster that is Myers, school security guard LL Cool J comes to the rescue. The battle between good and evil leads to an exceptional climax in which Laurie takes on Michael herself in order to end the mayhem once and for all.While not up to the caliber of the original, ""Halloween: H20"" makes up for the unfortunate loss of Dr. Loomis (played by Donald Pleasance, who passed away after during filming of the previous sequel) with excellent supporting roles from the charismatic LL Cool J and the underrated Arkin. Full of chills and thrills, Steve Miner does a fine job setting up the shocks with his deliberate use of camera angles and a frightening musical score. The opening scene is perhaps one of the most terrifying of all time. One of the better slasher films of the ""Scream"" era.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

196,Dandy_Desmond,Echoes of the scream generation but still solid,7,15 August 2010,"When scream came out it was a massive success. It re generated interest in horror slasher movies and especially Halloween. It was an enticing prospect enough as a potential big hit to bring Jamie Lee Curtis back into the world of horror to reprise her role as Laurie Strode. As H20 starts the nurse (from the original Halloween 1 & 2) is murdered and her files on Laurie Strode are stole. Michael has finally found his sister and immediately sets out to get her again.We then catch up with Laurie 20 years after that Halloween night she was stalked by Michael Myers and her friends were killed. She has faked her death and now lives under another name with her son John as she is separated from her husband. Laurie is a woman with issues still and her secret is threatening to overwhelm her. Jamie Lee Curtis does a cracking job of bringing back Laurie and giving her the depth the role needed. The film is set in a boarding school for boys and girls - the pupils are all off on a holiday but Lauries son John, his girlfriend and two other friends stay behind to party. Michael finds the place and all mayhem ensues as usual. This is quite a strong entry into the Halloween series, mainly due to the performance and character of Jamie Lee Curtis. However there is a strong echo of the scream generation here and it sometimes gets a little tiresome. Examples include lots of horror movie references, stupid lines like 'your so Renaissance!' - I mean who talks like that? The horrible 'scream like' music, which I understand the producers replaced John Ottmans music with!So although it has its faults it is a good movie and it was good to see Jamie Lee Curtis back.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
197,benjaminwest-242,A solid revival of the franchise,6,30 October 2021,"Halloween H20: 20 Years Later proves to be a good reviving of the Halloween franchise with Curtis' Laurie Strode. The acting is solid, with a good performance from Curtis in particular, and a fulfilling supporting cast. The emotional depth at play is also largely well executed, proving the trauma that the first two films' events caused. This assists the eeriness of a Myers return, in which this film he is just as frightening. The plot also has a satisfying final sequence. However, there are various flaws. Simply, there is not enough action until the final sequence, which takes away from the full potential of a Myers film. Some characters' actions are also nonsensical at times, making the film become sort of unbelievable. The character development did not prove as much as it could have, either, setting the film back in its attempt to instill fear in the audience, and to gather the viewers to wholly root for the protagonists. Overall, though, a solid addition the franchise.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
198,MovieKing-4,He`s been waiting for 20 years for this day and now it has finally come...,10,15 April 1999,"Halloween H20 is the best Halloween movie in the series, there is once again a sequel that is better than the original, it has a better story line than all of the Halloween movies put together, there is a star studded cast, with LL Cool J from In the House,Michelle Williams from Dawsons Creek and Jamie Lee Curtis from near enough every decent horror film out.Now with all these successful movie stars in one of the most successful movies in the 90`s it is pretty obvious that this Movie will be a huge success, perhaps the greatest horror since Halloween the original.Now there is,unlike most Halloween movies, a very good story line,...... Michael Meyers who failed to kill Laurie Strode 20 years ago now has a final chance to succeed in filling out his personal vendetta, which is to kill every member of his surviving family.Now after 20 years Laurie Strode and Michael Meyers face each other in a battle to the death, brother versus sister.....sounds like a children game don`t it. Well when you watch this it IS NOT a childs game, it is the greatest showdown I have ever seen in a Movie between two of the most rememberable horror characters in history.Believe it or not I really do feel sorry for Michael Meyers at the end of this movie, you just watch it!!! It is the greatest horror movie since Scream.....and it is possibly better.So I give this movie a very well deserved 9 and a half out of 10. Because of the short showdown between the two.Well it is not really that short...... well that`s enough from me...just watch it.......you will thank me after.I don`t really see an 8th Halloween coming.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

Fortunately, it's not the worst movie ever.It actually does two things right.It actively ignores and erases Thorn trilogy from canon and continues 20 years after Halloween II. It brings back Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode.We also get young Josh Hartnet and Michelle Williams. Which is kinda sweet. We get a bit of PTSD Laurie Strode that self medicates with booze while trying to run a school and raise a teenager and all that under a fake name. It's a competent revival, an homage a bit, a bit fresh stuff. Probably the worst thing I can say about it that it's forgettable as a movie but has some cool scenes and that it still clings onto Laurie is Michael's sister storyline that no one cared about.It's on par with Scream movies that were all the rage at the time, if that means anything to you.

Many of you complain that it doesn't live up to the original but then neither do the freddie or jason movies. Very few film sequels (with the exception of Terminator 2) can beat there originals.

The movie is very short but it's worth every second of the suspense. Michael Myers is back and the reason why everyone is so suprised in the movie is because it is supposed to be that H3-6 never occured. It's scary, funny, and suspenseful.

205,PlayerSS,A good outing for the Halloween series,6,29 September 2003,"This movie starts off pretty good and it stays good for the most part. This is where 4 through 6 are ignored. H20 takes place 20 years after the (second?) movie. Jamie Lee Curtis makes her valiant return to the Halloween series. She also has a new kid, which is John Tate. Laurie has changed her name to go into hiding from Michael. If you can overlook how this film messes up all the continuity of the series, this is a pretty good Halloween movie in my opinion. There are a few complaints I have about it, however. The blood doesn't really look realistic enough in this movie. It's too thin and has sort of an orange color.  Yes, this is also a very teenage-style movie. There is not very good acting in this movie, although Jamie lee Curtis and Josh Hartnett (in his debut role) do have good chemistry together. The rest of the cast are just there to be Myers' victims.Chris Durand took over as Michael for a one time deal in this movie. He is too short as Michael; the clothes look really big on him. He walks way too fast as Michael as well. This is not Durand's fault, but the mask is none of the best; the eye holes are too big; it exposes too much around his eyes. It's too obvious that's it's been painted over in some scenes because the white shade doesn't match 100%. In short, Durand is one of my most hated Michael actors. The kills are decent in this movie though. The two young guys at the beginning should have been shown getting killed. Only two out of the five deaths are shown. Needless to say, that was a little disappointing to a horror fan like me. Still, this is a solid entry into the Halloween series.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

I have to say that I thought Halloween was brilliant but Halloween 2 was a bit boring but H20 makes up for it because it's absolutely riveting. There is great character development, even though the movie is quite short and there is an enormous amount of suspense which builds up throughout the movie. It might not be a tactful movie but it sure beats a movie with tact! Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is excellent and made a smart making this movie because she sure does get revenge. Michelle Williams from Dawson's Creek is also very good. Apart from the fact that i've never seen a school look like the one in this movie, the scenery was great.

Climax keeps you from dying but gives you a heart attack. I'm just joking but it comes close to that. This is just one of those movies that are just as good as the first. Like Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. They're both just as good. Watch this movie with the lights out and the sound loud. You might just have a heart attack. I think the performances were ok.

210,ADOZER200,Worthy enough modern horror flick,7,23 January 2003,When i began to watch horror movies i noticed that most awesome horror movie were all made in the 70s or the early 80s. Most Modern movies sucked. There were a few good suspense and a good thriller here and there but no actual great horror movie. Now the remake of Night of the Living Dead was really good and i feel that there was no better horror movie from the 90s. I have to give Scream props for bringing back the horror genre but it was too silly. Made me laugh more than it made me scream. Halloween H20 i would have to say was a very worthy sequel amongst the series. It was better than Return and Revenge of Micheal Myers and far better than Season of the Witch. Resurrection didnt hold a candle to it nether. The Curse of Micheal Myers ran baout the same with its fright scenes but the story line wasnt as good and somewhat could be confusing at times. This one reminded me of the first and second one at the beginning. With the whole neighborhood scene and all but i dont want to creat spoilers. Credit is due here for this film. Plus Jamie Lee Curtis returns and does a great job Josh Hartnet and Michelle Williams does an excellent job too and LL Cool J plays a good enough role as well. I enjoyed it and if anyone asks about if there are any worthy modern horror movie i would have to recommned this one. Its nothing classical of the horror genre but it will do until a really great modern classic does come along!!,Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
211,davidmalaimo,michael myers does Scream,6,19 October 2020,"Sure the 6th scream had Paul Rudd, but was made right before you needed to include teenagers at school being cool and listening to grunge music in your horror films for the tweens and high schoolers to sneak into. it was a nice little potential send off for the franchise, like the 2018 follow up kind of ignoring the other sequels but this one keeps the Halloween 2 canon.i love my 90s slashers but this film kinda seemed to only include that late 90s teen slasher vibe outa necessity and it feels a little off to me, but seems like it worked for a lot of people. i think i enjoy 4 and 5 the best out of the halloween franchise but all in all, michael doesn't do it for me and i don't particularly like the family stuff. glad they got rid of it for the 2018 one but to be honest, it still felt like it was there cause jamie lee curtis is pretty much acting the same but just not calling him his brother. idk anywaysthe ending was wicked epic, i will certainly give it that! can't believe Laurie Strode was Michael all along! jkjkso i didn't particularly enjoy this one but you might. bad review. sorry",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
212,MissCzarChasm,"Glad Jamie Lee Curtis is back, but it could've been better",7,29 April 2002,"Some may be turned off by this film because it is the 7th installment of the Halloween series. However, the filmmakers of this feature seem to treat it as the third since they totally disregard 3-6. Too bad 4 had to be in that group of forgotten movies because it was actually quite good and better than this sequel in my opinion. The main highlight is that it takes place 20 years after the original and it brings back one of the greatest horror heroines to ever grace the screen, The original scream queen, Jamie Lee Curtis. Essentially this is a project made for her and in that aspect it totally works, however as a Halloween film it feels out of place. It seems to have picked up on the new millenium horror trend of adding hot teen actors into the mix and is basically shot like an episode of Dawson's Creek. Kevin Williamson even did some polishing on the script. In this aspect it doesn't work too well, but for the 7th installment in the series i guess it could've been worse.As i said this is a showcase of Jamie Lee Curtis. It's very interesting to see how her character has changed in 20 years. Her performance is very good and is much more assertive than she was in the first 2 installments of the series. The problem is she is one oft he few characters worth any interest. Josh Hartnet as her son, and Michelle Williams as his love interest are the only 2 teen actors in the film worth mentioning. Josh Hartnet and Jamie Lee Curits share a very good mother/son chemistry that is vry effective in the film. Michelle Williams is more believeable than most potential teen slasher movie victims in her role. The rest of the cast is DOA. The supporting characters are vastly under-written. LL Cool J is funny in his scenes but they are too far and in between for him to become very interesting character. The other teen actors are just there to be slaughtered. The only oher interesting cast choice is Janet Leigh(shower victim from Psycho) in a Cameo. very cool to see mother and daughter together on screen. Michael Myers just isn't scary in this film. No because his presence is wearing thin because this is the 7th installment but because he isn't portrayed well by the actor/stuntman.There are good things though that raise it above most of the  sequels. The second half comes at you with full force. After a rather long set-up things move into high gear once Michael begins to wreck havoc. His showdown with Laurie is good but i wish it could've been longer. Another interesting thing this sequel does is gives us some closure. you'll see once you view the film. It's very rare that a series does this and it's very effective in this film.I recommend this film based on the performance of Jamie Lee Curtis. If you want to see how she has been in the last 20 years than this is a film for you. Fans of the series should see this. I just worry that Halloween Ressurrection will ruin the semi-good note this film ended on, when it's released this summer. I hope to god they have a reason to bring Michael back for THE 8TH TIME. Evil never dies apparently and neither does this series even when it does have a fairly good finale.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

Maybe it was the father of all the slasher movies but I thought it was just boring without any thrills. However I loved this sequel. It builds up the characters nicely. Everyone acts fine and especially Jamie Lee Curtis does a very good job. There are few quite good scares and a lot of cheesy ones too but they are just funny. Michael Myers is brutal and evil. The action in the second part of the movie is very nice. There are some faults but they are not very big. I would have liked there to be some kind of an end sequence where they would have shown that Jamie Lee Curtis's character got over her fear. Also LL Cool J's character was supposed to be funny? I found him just annoying and he really should have died. Otherwise I really enjoyed the movie. Quite scary and exciting ride especially if you watch it in the dark.

216,pmcguireumc,"despite its critics, in some ways better than the original",9,26 October 2008,"My wife (who hates horror movies) and I went to see this, and even she thought it was a decent film. Why? Well, unlike most franchise horror movies, it has a cast that can actually act.First, there is Jamie Lee Curtis who does a fantastic job reprising her role as the tortured sister. Her struggles in the film show a truism of life, that past trauma has its consequences and often negatively impacts the present. This is evidenced by her throughout, whether the opening nightmare to her struggles with her son and lover. Curtis (of whom I am generally not a fan) does a great job and for my money, does a far better job in this one than in the first two (in which all she did was scream).Josh Hartness is very effective as her son, and their chemistry together is very believable.Other notables: Jamie's mom in real life (Janet Leigh) has a very nice cameo (and a replica of her car from Psycho also makes an appearance). Also, LL Cool J has a very nice role as the school's guard. The love interests in the film are gorgeous, and while I always enjoy a good nude scene, the film did not suffer from its lack of flesh (unlike the gorier crap films like Slumber Party Massacre, etc, etc,).Ultimately, I found H20 to be the most thoughtful and enjoyable film in the the Halloween series.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

But really, none of the sequels besides Rob Zombie's remake live up to it.Besides the poor scare factor, Halloween H20 also changes the style of the Halloween tradition. It's hipper, set in a posh, remote private school with preppy teenagers and Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, who returns to her famous role, is disappointingly wooden in this performance) is the headmaster.She now has a seventeen year old son (Josh Hartnett in his first film), who is dating sexy Michelle Williams (of Dawson's Creek fame) and is friends with a bunch of other boring unknowns. Anyway, none of them really matter to you because none of them has any back story or particularly pleasant moments. So when (surprise) Michael Myers shows up once again to kill his sister Laurie, you just enjoy watching him hack his way through the bland teenagers. It's all set to music which I'm pretty sure was taken right out of the ""Scream"" trilogy, none of the creepy Halloween music or tension is there. Michael Myers is barely kept in the shadows. OR THE MOVIE! We spend way too much boring time on the teenagers partying. And when he finally comes face to face with Laurie, the movie ends in about fifteen minutes! It takes a LONG LONG time setting up the exciting climax at the end. The film could have been helmed under a much more inspired director. This is disappointing from Steve Miner, who made ""Lake Placid"". This is not a horrible film and it's not great either. The series just unfortunately died long before this mildly unsatisfyingly thriller. Despite,as aforementioned, Curtis's rather let down of a performance it's still great to see her return to the franchise and Laurie Strode still kicks ass. There are tons of homages to the original Halloween so watch closely. All in all, the movie achieves only a handful of genuine scares that can't make up for the running time.

I'm so glad they ignored the other useless sequels and brought back some of the feeling from the first two. Not that the other sequels have no merit; they simply should not have been ""Halloween"" sequels. Jamie Lee Curtis gives a great performance as a haunted Laurie Strode, who is forced to fight her demons once and for all.

The spooky/scary thing about Michael is that he finds you.

It's well-worth the view and purchase.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
220,ARTaylor,"The ""Aliens"" of the Halloween Saga",10,11 November 2008,"This is the only sequel worthy of the John Carpenter classic. Why? Because they brought it back to the suspenseful origins and made the series truly scary again.The problem with the series was that it forgot what made the original so scary. The original was scary because of suspense. The audience knew Michael was doing something and the others didn't. The others were more like Friday the 13th and about gore and blood.Plus the series, like Friday and Nightmare on Elm Street, was getting out of hand. Halloween 2 was a typical sequel, mostly copied the original but had some good moments. The following movie was so awful it should not be spoken of. H4 was decent, it was a lot like a suburban Friday and should have ended there. H5 was where it got weird with the psychic girl and really should have ended. And H6 was plain awful. Not surprising, Friday and Nightmare went through the same thing.But then Scream came along and took slasher movies to their origins. A powerful but not mystical villain, focusing on characters and not how they die, and most importantly using suspense instead of gore. The first following Halloween movie follows suit excellently. No psychics. No ancient cults. Just good characters and a scary villain.The best part is that is ignores H4-6. Lets face it, Jamie was only created because Curtis didn't want to do endless sequels and only seemed to cry. Don't mind her going away.Like the original, blood is kept to a minimum. It's about the people not simply how people die. It also returns to the idea that the audience knows more than the characters, encouraging them to yell at the screen.The movie provides the most realistic evolution of the characters of any of the sequels, taking many notes from James Cameron's 1986 Aliens. Like Ripley, Laurie is still haunted by the previous movie. She has nightmares that it's going to happen again. To deal with it she's overprotective when it comes to her son and a full blown alcoholic. A natural progression when someone was been through that ordeal. John is tired of never being able to do anything because his uncle may still be out there. And no one believes Michael is still alive because he's been dormant for twenty years, but that would fit him since he didn't do anything for fifteen years under Loomis' care.There are other Aliens inspirations. Laurie going back into the school after her son has left mirrors Ripley going into alien hive. Laurie standing there with the ax is very much like Ripley in the power loader facing the queen. Laurie's journey is very much mirrors Ripley's. The tortured soul struggling to find peace, and finding it by confronting and destroying her own worst fear.The ending makes a perfect end to a trilogy. I don't care what Resurrection says, if you watch closely only the unstoppable killer Michael Myers would move that way and no one else. That moment between Michael and Laurie where you don't really know whether he's trying to make one last attempt to kill her or if he just wants to touch his only sibling. This is also the first time Michael is clearly dead. He survived being shot and lived through the explosion in two different continuities. But only decapitating him saw the true end. Michael's dead. John believes his mother. And Laurie can finally relax. It is a stunning conclusion that resolves all the issues.It's just sad that they had to follow this with the awful Resurrection, which completely ruined this fantastic ending and went back to being a gushing blood fest. And then that Rob Zombie abomination.It's a shame more sequels aren't like this. Most are quickly put together just to make a few bucks from those who enjoyed the first. This was put together not from the desire for a few easy bucks like most horror sequels. But for the desire to revisit a classic and continue the characters. As good sequels do. I only wish they could have gotten John Carpenter to do this. This could have been a lot like Wes Craven's New Nightmare, the only Nightmare sequel worthy of the original.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
221,Chris-332,The best Halloween movie sequel by far!,10,20 December 1998,"Halloween H2O is the best Halloween sequel ever. This movie gave me chills. Everything about it worked. For once there is a horror that is not predictable at all. For example, a character in the movie reaches down in the garbage disposal to get a bottle opener, just when you see Michael in the background. A normal horror movie would have it that his fingers get all chopped because the killer presses the ON button, but no, the kid gets the bottle opener out successfully, sees Michael, then gets slashed. H2O has everything, gore, terror, and everything that makes a good horror movie a good horror movie.   10/10",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
222,ivony,Great horror sequel,7,7 September 2003,"I'd be surprised if any film can truly hold up (in our minds) to the intense feelings the original Halloween stirred up.  With such a horror classic to be compared to, it's no wonder so many fall short of the mark.  However, on that note, Halloween H2O is a sequel worthy of being part of the Halloween series. (There are a few, I'm afraid, that should simply never have been made <CO resurrection UGH>Anyway, H2O once again features Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode...younger sister of Michael Myers.  This time, however, it is 20 years later and she is now living under an assumed name with her teenage son.  It isn't long before Myers discovers her whereabouts and the fun begins.Sure, it's a cliche film (err, what slasher/horror movie ISN'T?) and it certainly has its moments of predictability  (again, what slasher/horror film doesn't??).  But that aside, H2O is a fun and enjoyable sequel. Honestly, you really should look at H20 as an extension of Halloween one and two and NOT as the sequel to the other films.  H20 is a fantastic popcorn horror flick to simply be enjoyed by those that love  a fun time.  The slash is back, the gore is good, the creepiness is a bit lacking, but not so bad in and of itself.  And the ending is THE BEST for the series to date (excluding Halloween the original of course).  They should have stuck with the ending of H20 rather than go on to make Resurrection with some ridiculous plot to return Michael Myers.  Just my opinion, of course.On the ""it's a sequel"" rating scale Halloween H20 earns a 3 1/2 out of 5 stars.  On Halloween night, grab 1, 2, and H20 and simply enjoy the ride!",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
223,Paul-103,Tries same formula without as much success,5,22 December 1998,"They've got the mask, the big knives, and the Jamie Lee Curtis screams; it just doesn't add up to much when you know EXACTLY what to expect.  My wife and I watch the original Halloween movie EVERY Halloweeen and are still not tired of it.  This sequel just doesn't have the suspense and small touches that made the first one so good.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
224,timefreezer7,The best finale - if you loved the first two films don't miss it,8,18 November 2003,"In 1978 a psychotic 21 year old escaped from the mental asylum where he was institutionalized for the murder of his sister and returned to his home town to do his unusual trick or treating on October 31st, namely All Hallows Eve. Hidden under a scary Captain Kirk mask and armed with a ""big sharp kitchen knife"" he brutally slaughtered many people. It is rumored that about 16 people lost their lives in one single night. The sole survivor of this horrendous massacre was a 17 year old girl who allegedly had a special link with the monstrous killer. After a battle with his doctor, the maniac was nowhere to be found and the girl was found terrorized and paralyzed with fear. She tried everything to get over this shocking night where she witnessed many of her friends being gutted like fish: group therapies, psychologists, meditation. Nothing worked. A few years later the newspapers wrote that she was killed in a car accident. It was over : the only person who escaped the ""Halloween Murders"" was dead as well.If all this sounds strangely familiar, you are absolutely right! I bet there is not a movie fan around the world who hasn't at least heard of the tale of the infamous Michael Myers who killed people on Halloween and his unfortunate sister Laurie Strode (played by Jamie Lee Curtis). Laurie could never forget her encounter with the masked Shape and suffered a lot until the car accident which reportedly killed her. Laurie Strode was no more ....... or so we thought. Laurie actually feared that the deranged Myers was alive and still after her so she entered a Witness Protection System to stage her death. She changed her name...her identity...her past...and her haircut!!! Laurie now lives far away from Haddonfield, in a boarding school in California. She is a divorced headmistress and she teaches Literature to the students under the name Keri Tate. She rarely talks to her ex-husband and has developed a drinking problem. She suffers from recurring nightmares about that fatal night and frequently takes pills to ease her pain. Every Halloween she is especially jumpy since she lives in the sheer terror that her insane brother will come back. She has a 17 year old son called John (Josh Hartnett) whom she is overprotective with. It is now 1998: 20 years after the carnage, October 31st is approaching and John is now a grown boy who wants some good healthy teenage activities. They quarrel because Keri doesn't want him out of the house on Halloween. ""I am just asking you for ONE lousy night!"" But John decides that enough is enough, ""NO mom! If you want to stay handcuffed to your dead brother, that's fine! You are not dragging me into this!"" Unfortunately for Keri her fears are not at all ridiculous. The demented Myers is indeed alive and eventually manages to track her down, even if it took him 20 whole years. On Halloween night he invades the boarding school. The majority of the students are away on a field trip so Michael sees the perfect chance to terrorize the deserted campus and finish what he started back in Haddonfield. Unfortunately Keri doesn't have much of help. Dr Loomis (played by the veteran Donald Pleasance) has passed away. Her fellow teacher, Will (Adam Arkin), who is also her boyfriend, and the security guard Ronny (L.L. Cool J.) are not prepared for this kind of menace and end up helpless victims. Laurie needs to protect herself as well as her precious son. This means that she will have to confront the killer/brother for one last time. It is almost impossible to feel for Curtis' heroine and get engaged to the premise if you haven't watched John Carpenter's indie masterpiece Halloween (1978) and the equally atmospheric follow-up Halloween II (1981). I will have to warn the hardcore fans (although you probably are aware of it by now) that the filmmakers and the writers opted to decline from the batch of Halloween 3 - 6 and create an alternative universe where Laurie doesn't have a daughter and Michael has vanished completely for 20 years without anyone hearing from him. There are no hints of druids or thorn curses either. The script returns to the basic roots of the Laurie Strode plotline. Dr Loomis allegedly survived at the end of Halloween II and spent his life trying to find his fugitive patient. A few years ago he died from natural causes. Veteran Donald Pleasance was dead in real life so they had to write out the character. Many fans were displeased with his absence but nothing could be done. Fortunately Jamie Lee Curtis fills in the void perfectly providing a tremendous amount of energy on the screen. Steve Miner was a perfect choice for the helm as he staged some truly chilling scenes. The film opens with a devilishly clever introductory sequence which is so shrewd and wicked that I wouldn't even dare giving it away. Then we have the most haunting opening credits I have ever seen in a film (again you will have to be familiar with Halloween II). Many have accused the movie for being a Scream derivative. Yes, it is obvious that Kevin Williamson had a small contribution and left his footprint on the project but his treatment was just the pre-credits scene (again altered) and the whereabouts of Keri/Laurie. The screenplay went through major changes and Robert Zappia was one of the many of the recruited writers. The script could have been written by John Carpenter and Debra Hill themselves since it does not rely on gore. Unfortunately nothing was as scary as the beginning. Fortunately instead of being wasted in slashing (regressing to a Friday the 13th clone) the movie has an extremely low body count and very little blood. Most of the deaths are off-screen! The film spends most of the time psychoanalyzing Laurie Strode and treating her like a real person. Her horrifying experience in 1978 didn't just conclude with the end credits of part II and the ""Mr. Sandman"" song. She spent her life hiding until one day she realized that she would have to get over it and stand up. There are many false scares and Miner does an exceptional job: from the first frame to the dream sequence the director shows his professionalism. The film was very successful not only concentrating on drama instead of violence but on finally revealing the essence of horror as depicted in all scary movies. When you see Myers stabbing someone it is not so scary. The truly terrifying part is the deserted takes in the beginning with the air of threat whiffing on the screen. The IDEA of danger is much more frightening than the danger itself. Laurie sees the crossing line when she realizes that her brother is not the boogeyman but a psycho killer that CAN be destroyed. She has to stop running but protect her son and her life as well . Although a bit rushed this is the most logical transition for her character after 2 movies and 20 years of hiding in dark corridors waiting pathetically to get it from the knife. There is a frequent complaint that the film is way too short with little action. Moustapha Akkad & Co. decided not to make another horror movie but a tribute to Halloween. Gosh, how successful it was! The film is full of lines and scenes which refer to the original. Watch carefully and you will see the homage (people hiding in the closet etc).Jamie Lee Curtis actually doesn't try to give a strong performance since her character is powerful enough to work on its own. The best acting is accomplished by a young Josh Hartnett who is convincing as a normal young man who wants to live his life and tries to keep his mother's reason intact as he believes her phobias are groundless. The rest of the young cast is unfortunately underdeveloped and you end up not caring for them. Adam Arkin has little screen time but plays very well and L.L. Cool J. tries to entertain us in the inevitable funny role. This is a one woman show though and Curtis is the host. Oh, there is also a pointless cameo from Janet Leigh (Curtis's real life mother) as Keri's secretary who serves as an indifferent Psycho tribute. The finale was the most perfect that could be conceived and suited the franchise. The producers had the boldness to end the story once and for all and wrap smartly the series. It was a great disappointment therefore that they had to make Halloween Resurrection (2002) and ruin the good effort. Even now I believe that any true fan will stick to this memorial final chapter and joy over the closure of the series. H20 despite its quirky title is a Halloween small classic which gives you some chills and will most probably satisfy you. Congratulations to anyone involved to this decent try. A good moment in 90's modern horror films. HALLOWEEN H20 : Twenty Years Later      8 / 10",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
225,sam_aj_01,Halloween returns as it should!,6,9 September 2008,"On what should have been an exciting sequel, i found Halloween H20 to be a big disappointment. What makes Halloween really is Jamie Lee Curtis, and i think thats the reason why the Halloween films without her have been so poor. The storyline is really messed up, according to some Michaels dead in the fourth then back in the seventh... it really is stupid but finally Halloween H20 clears up all the misconceptions.The film starts of really tense with a good storyline and lots of surprises but when we see Michael in the flesh its like taking a step backwards. The mask is completely different as well as the actor who's like half the originally actors size...I wish they planned a better ending but all in all it wasn't too bad and it definitely was a treat after the other films...",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
226,jpasols,New Setting and New Pace for the Series!,10,11 May 2019,"Halloween H2O: Twenty Years Later is the seventh entry in the Halloween franchise! I must say I have always liked this sequel! It's very intriguing and pulse quickening!. A TRUE edge of your seat thriller/horror film.
Now Halloween H2O obviously released in 1998, around the same time movies like Scream and Scream 2 and I Know What You Did Last Summer, in the late 1990s horror movies kinda had their own trend, the whole ""Hip and Scary"" Era. Halloween H2O felt a lot like I was watching Scream 1 or 2 but without the ghostface killer. Halloween H2O even had the same soundtrack as the original Scream movie did. I gotta admit that kinda annoyed me with this film because it constantly made me forget I was watching a Halloween movie. Another big change to this installment was the setting, with Halloween H2O we are no longer in Haddonfield, Illinois, this time the terror takes place in Summer Glenn, California, where Laurie Strode (now under the name of Kerri Tate for hiding purposes) is the headmaster of a private school where her 17 year old son, John goes to, (mind you, Halloween H2O is ignoring all of the events of Halloween 4-6, meaning that in this film Laurie Strode never had Jamie Lloyd). Halloween H2O acts as a TRUE third installment to the original Halloween trilogy, this is only the second timeline of the franchise.
There are some really good scare tactics in this film and most of the time you're on the edge of your seat and biting your nails! I've seen Halloween H2O MANY MANY times and it STILL gets me everytime!!! Especially the elevator scene with Jodi Lynn O'Keefe, that scene has always terrified me! If you've seen Halloween H2O you'll know what I'm talking about! It scares me every single times and always makes my heart race! One of my favorite scenes from H2O.
The soundtrack in this movie is pretty good, we still have our beloved Halloween theme by John Carpenter, and then we have most of the soundtrack of this film from the composer of the original Scream, which personally I wasnt the biggest fan of (adding the Scream soundtrack to a Halloween movie) but that's just my opinion about it. There is even a scene in this movie where Michelle Williams (as Molly) and Jodi Lynn O'Keefe (as Sarah) are smoking pot in their dorm room together and on the TV they're actually watching Scream 2. So not only is the Scream 1 soundtrack involved with this film but you also get a nice little scene from Scream 2 in this movie also. Which was actually kinda cool to see, but really could have toned down the Scream 1 soundtrack for this movie and replaced it with more original and new composed music or the usual Halloween soundtrack (but updated for the late 90s).
The cast in this film is pretty damn solid! We have the amazing and wonderfully talent original scream queen, Jamie Lee Curtis, playing the role of Laurie Strode for the now 3rd time, and like always, SHE DOES NOT DISAPPOINT!. I swear everytime Jamie Lee Curtis plays the role of Laurie Strode she gives it her ALL every single time and I love Curtis for it!!!. Aside from the amazing Jamie Lee, we are joined by new faces to the franchise such as, Josh Hartnett as Laurie's 17 year old rebellious son, John. We have Ms. Michelle Williams playing as John's girlfriend, Molly. We have Ms. Jodi Lynn O'Keefe, playing as college student and John and Molly's friend, Sarah. We also have LL Cool J as Ronnie the school Security guard, and Joseph Gordon Levitt as Jimmy (Levitt has a very small part in the first 20 min of this film and his character is killed off almost instanly), we are also joined by one last remaining familiar face of the original two Halloween films, Nancy Stephens as Marion Chambers. Overall I'd say there isnt one person in the Halloween H2O cast that I didn't like, they're all pretty likeable characters played by likeable actors and actresses. So that gives this film a HUGE plus.
One of the things about this film that annoyed me more than ANYTHING else was Michael's mask in this film, I swear his mask changed at least 5 times in this film. In the first 20 minutes of the film it looks like he's wearing the Halloween 2 (1981) mask, and then it looks like he's wearing the Halloween 6 mask when he splits Marion Chambers' throat. There is a scene in the middle of the film where Michael kills the boy looking for the corkscrew and his mask was 100% CGIed. The mask wouldn't stop changing in this film and it's like the makers couldn't decide which mask they liked better. So they had Michael wear 5 to 8 different masks throughout this film and it gets annoying.
Now the ending scene of this film!!!!!, a lot of people say the ending of this movie should have been the ending to the entire Halloween series! In the last 15 minutes of the film, Paramedics put Michael's assumed dead body in a body bag and load him in a van which Laurie steals and takes off with. While speeding down the road Laurie notices Michael is moving in the body bag so she stomps on the breaks and Michael Flys through the windshield window and onto the gravel in front of the van. Michael stands up and Laurie hits him with the van driving over the edge of a cliff and down a hill where Laurie flew out of the vehicle and the van pins Michael between it and a large tree branch. Laurie picks up an axe and walks over to the trapped pinned up Michael Myers, Laurie talks to Michael Gently and even touches his hand while crying. This moment is kinda emotional because in this particular film they still are brother and sister and Laurie knew that. But she came back to her sense and swung the axe at Michael's head, decapitating him. We see Michael's head roll down the hill and stop in front of the camera and hear Laurie's heavy breathing. Then the film ends. This scene was absolutely AMAZING and BRILLIANT!!!!!! BRAVO JAMIE LEE CURTIS!!!!! I wish I was old enough to see this film in theaters back in 1998 because I heard from everyone who saw this in theaters that when Laurie chopped Michael's head off there was a standing ovation!!!!!. I'm gonna carry not being old enough to see this in theaters to MY GRAVE!!!!!. Truly amazing ending to this film!! A lot of people say it should have been the end of the franchise...but then they ruined a perfectly good ending to a series with Halloween: Resurrection which was released 3 years later. Could have done without Resurrection because it completely ruined what this film had going (or ruined what this film had tried to end).Overall Halloween H2O is a very worthy a solid Halloween sequel and I highly recommend this movie!!! Its extremely thrilling and scary and enjoyable!!!! Give this amazing slasher flick a go! You wont be disappointed. And if you are disappointed I dont know what's wrong with you. :/My final rating for Halloween H2O: 10 out of 10",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

Jamie Lee Curtis gives a wonderful performance, strong and confident. She no longer is scared and vulnerable like she was in part 1 and 2 but a fighter. Michael Myers seems to have lost some of the impact he had in the first film, he is no longer as scary as he was back in 1978. Josh Harnett gave a pretty good performance better than what i expected as Curtis son. Jodi Lynn O Keefe and Michelle Williams are your standard victims, and I felt they tried to be the 90s versions of Nancy Loomis and PJ Soles(from the original film) but both failed to do that.Overall excellent ending, and a good way to end the series.

230,S_dot_M_dot,To the Point,7,5 November 2021,"Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is presumed dead and there has been no sign of blood-thirsty killer Michael Myers (Chris Durand) for 20 years. Strode has faked her death and has assumed the identity of Hillcrest Academy headmistress Keri Tate. There, with her son John (Josh Hartnett), Laurie discovers Michael has tracked her down and is hellbent on ending her and her son's lives.This is a very fast-paced film. Director Steve Miner gets right to the point and opens the film with a fury. The audience is barely able to breathe as one tense scene after another encompasses the screen. The setting of the film at a private school gives you open space, but also confines our characters, adding an extra level of dread.The acting is on par with other horror films of the era. Hartnett hit his stride early with a performance that catapulted his career and turned him into an overnight sensation. Curtis plays Laurie Strode with tenacity and sheds light on real life issues and ways to cope with them.While this version of Michael Myers has a set agenda and a brooding demeanor, his iconic mask leaves a lot to be desired. Giving off an angsty teenage look, this rendition of the Shape was not the best look. The overall feel is that of the late 90s slasher craze, not like the franchise that set the standard for slashers. Extending the runtime would have helped explain where Myers has been hiding for 20 years.Halloween H20 brings the same Michael Myers, just to a different location. The young cast sets the tone for the audience they are trying to connect with.

Jaimie Lee Curtis is back and its discovered by none other than her brother, Michael, who tried to kill her 20 years before, that she now lives and teaches at a preparatory school in California. Michael, in true fashion, shows up to try to finish the job he began years ago.With the absence of Dr. Loomis (granted, Donald Pleasence did pass away) the movie was better off leaving it at 6 movies instead of adding this one to the line-up. LL Cool J, while funny, comes off as nothing more in this movie than the token black guy who, as a security guard, is just basically paid to be friends with the kids.Positive: The kills are fairly realistic, and the movie has good potential to take its ailing storyline and make it something better. Negative: It just never does. At times I'm sitting here watching it and wondering when and where the action will begin.If you're a die hard Halloween fan, this one is sure to make you're collection complete.

235,very_doubtful,Above average (!SERIOUS SPOILERS!),7,22 March 2000,"I saw this movie both in the movie-theatre and at home. Watching it in the cinema turned out to be a very cool experience for I enjoyed it very much. Then, at home, the film was fairly good but far away from making the same impact on me.Right at the beginning of the film we see the nurse from the original Halloween entering her house and realizing that it has been broken into. Some neighbors check the house but find that the thief must have gone. We then get to know the ""thief"" and so do the nurse and the two neighbor guys. The film's beginning is therefore very promising.We then see Laurie Strode (who has changed her name and is working as a principal) having nightmares about her evil brother and living in constant fear that he might return. Laurie's son is not so psyched about his mother not letting him leave the campus on Halloween. He decides to have his own little Halloween party somewhere in the school buildings with his girlfriend and another couple. But then Michael gate-crashes the party and starts his own little celebration.In the final confrontation between brother and sister, Michael is then decapitated by tough Laurie Strode. Finally Laurie has had her revenge.The film comes up with several great ideas like repeating the speech of Dr. Loomis from the original Halloween (too bad he couldn't be in this one any more, it would have made this film so much better). There is also some very good directing by Steve Miner but the film includes too much teen stuff (it's pretty obvious they were trying to get the ""Scream"" audience to the screen). Instead of concentrating on creating an eerie atmosphere in the film (like Halloween did) they decided to fill it up with unnecessary teen-relationship-stuff (Why do we have to know them if they get gutted anyway?). Michael Myers was fully convincing though, with a very scary-looking mask and a BIG knife.I was quite sad about Michael being killed but then I heard that there will be a film called Halloween H2K and I got VERY happy again (Does that mean that Michael is still alive?! Well, EVIL NEVER DIES, right?)!Overall this film is one of the better ones in the series.My rating: 7/10",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

Her Laurie is nearly unrecognizable from the girl we met 20 years ago. She's addicted to booze and pills and lives every day looking over her shoulder. There's real human drama at play here which makes the horror elements pop when they show up.

241,dude5568,somewhat avoidable...,4,19 June 2010,"i saw this film few days back and i'd say nothing about it was as impressive as i was expecting,as a horror/thriller fan i would say that it was not up to the mark,very few brief moments of the typical slasher film and also quite boring in between,for films like these you cannot say horrible or good and they tend to be somewhere in between.To be specific the climax was pretty dull and had no real thrilling touch to it and the best part of such films is the climax itself,so i would rate this one somewhere close to 4 out of 10.There are way too many horror flicks above this one(esp the new Halloween) and so to sum it up its somewhat avoidable and i would always go for something more thrilling and entertaining like Wrong Turn etc etc...",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

243,Fenris Fil,Halloween does Scream,5,10 April 2006,"I can sum this film up quite easily. The previous Halloween sequels provided exactly what the trashy horror audience of it's day expected. Generic Slasher flicks (well, 4 onwards anyway).This film provides exactly what the trashy horror audience of it's day expects. A generic ""Scary Movie"" genre flick.It also does what too many modern movies have decided to do which is to pretentiously presume itself to be better then it's peers. Taking such actions as pretending the previous films didn't happen and to do a ""ultimately-finally-unchangably"" ending, which of course we all knew at the time and have been proved right since, wouldn't be the end of the series at all. So why do it? The Scary Movie genre elements detracted a lot from the film. Of course the modern audience is more willing to accept that then slasher flick elements so many of them say this is the best Halloween for a while, but I think when people look at this in another 10 years time they will say it was poor and stereotypical and really didn't deliver.This was perhaps the most excessively hyped up horror I've seen for years and that is all it was - Hype. Sure it was nice to see Laurie Strode again, but it wasn't directed by John Carpenter and it didn't have anything like the atmosphere of the original Halloween and anyone that says otherwise really needs to watch the two back to back. It's not a return to form or a return to the original style. It's just trading in one trashy generic element for a more current but just as trashy generic element and then patting itself on the back for doing it.Really between the pretentious elements and the scary movie elements I counted only one good Horror scene and a couple of bits with a reasonable ""cool"" factor.Overall this is perhaps the most disappointing Horror I've ever seen. Not the worst, but most disappointing because I am a fan of the original and I did buy into the hype before I watched this.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

What the film does offer is a mostly strong script and an excellent performance from Jamie Lee Curtis whose Laurie Strode has faked her death after the gruesome events of the first two films (H20 pretends everything after that point never happened) and is now the functionally alcoholic headmistress of a private boarding school in California.Despite its issues, it's still a more interesting story than most of the other sequels in the series.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

246,on_the_can,If only they hadn't made so many...,7,2 November 2008,"Halloween H20 is as much a tribute to the 1978 classic as it is a sequel.The original two Halloween films blend together like a 3 hour movie and after it's explosive climax Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken away in an ambulance, a trembling wreck unable to fully accept that her stalker/brother Michael Meyers is in fact dead. Now 20 years later Laurie is living under the false name of Keri Tate with her newly 17 year old son John (Josh Hartnett), who is also one of the students at the private school she over sees in relative seclusion. She is still haunted my nightmares of her hellish 1978 experience and as such suffers from severe paranoia over the safety of her son. As the story unfolds though of course she learns that her paranoia was not unfounded as Michael is still very much alive and now has a penchant for not only finishing what he started all those years ago but taking it one step further and killing his nephew as well.The film moves along at a brisk pace but manages to retain much of the feel of the original tone. Aside from the obligatory teen slayings of the modernized genre the first half of the film follows a formula more a kin to a thriller with the killer silently stalking its prey. This invokes a creepy vibe not present in a lot of these films of late and serves the story well. As I said at the start though this movie was made largely as a tribute and celebration of the original. There are several echoes of the original two movies seen through out, including eerie dream sequences, flash backs, lines of dialog, Michael's scenes of stalking and some more blatant moments, like Laurie almost taking futile refuge in a closet like she did 20 years prior.The best moments of this movie though come near the end when Laurie and her brother Michael finally come face to face again. There's a truly chilling moment (especially if you're a fan) where the two characters stare at each other ominously through the window of a door. Laurie also isn't the defenseless teenager she once was and is now ready to stand up to her bully of brother, making for some fair fights.The movie's downfall though, is unfortunately not its fault, but the fault of the four other sequels that came between II and H20. I'll admit to not having seen all of those sequels so any severe judgment of them would be unfair but even if each one was stellar in it's own right the formulaic killings of any slasher franchise grows stale after so many incarnations. It also takes away from the genuine eeriness of the character. There were implications from the get go that there may be something supernatural about Meyers, which is creepy and cool in its ambiguity, but after cheating death as many times as he has it soon becomes obvious that there must something unnatural and the blatant loss of realism steals from the fright. And most of all the emotional weight of Laurie seemingly moving on with her life only to be attacked once again is somewhat lost as she most surely would be aware of all the action Michael has seen over the years. H20 actually deliberately ignores those middle sequels so you could watch I, II, and H20 as a stand alone trilogy, but an anniversary movie just isn't the same when there's been no absence to make your heart grow fonder.A fun horror movie...but as with most of these franchises, less is probably more.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

LL COOL J is the security guard and he's fun so is his wife. The idea is very good and the acting is outstanding. Some of the best of the series.

Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed. As a die-hard fan of the Halloween series I've been a bit disappointed with the quality of some of the sequels. Not to say that they didn't provide their own share of scares, they just never equaled the power of the first two. Halloween 6 had potential, but met its demise on the editing (butcher's block) table. Finally there is a worthy sequel in Halloween H20.

Laurie faked her own death so that Michael could not find her or her son John (Josh Hartnett)Now she is known as Keri Tate and is the principal of a private school. Keri continues to have visions and nightmares of her brother and has started to turn to drink. She is also quite controlling of her son who just wants to break free and become his own man. On Halloween night Michael returns to find Keri and John and finish off his bloodline for good, but they're not going to go without a fight! The film i believe was a really good thriller and tried to be more than just the typical hack and slash horror affair we've come to know from lots of horror films which i felt was a breath of fresh air.As ever Jamie Lee Curtis was excellent playing this very scared and tortured woman running from her past that she fears is constantly trying to catch up to her, she played the character to a top notch performance. Josh Hartnett is also very good playing Curtis son John who's is forever trying to be a free man from the constant controlling grasp of his mother. And of course Chris Durrand must get a mention as playing the part of Michael, i believe he does put in a good performance as Michael but i don't think he gives the best performance we've seen from the guys that portray Michael but it is among one of the best.The story is one that is very believable with a few twists and turns that just make the film a little more fun. The look of the film is very clever and very creepy at times and in a suspense picture such as this you really need this. The direction is very good from Steve Miner who brought us Friday the 13th part 2 and 3 who makes his own Halloween film while at the same time reflecting and homaging the original.I only have a couple of gripes with the film, one has to be the ending which i felt was a bit out of place from the rest of the film and also a little too quick which i felt spoilt it and didn't really round off the story completely which was a bit of a shame considering the film had been so good. The other problem with the film is that it takes some time for Michael to get to the nitty gritty of killing which in some ways isn't bad but in others it gets a little dull when the film is called Halloween but there is no boogeyman! Overall i thought that this was great film and definitely a great sequel in what was slowly becoming a very idiotic franchise but thanks to some clever storytelling this film manages to bring the franchise back up to a whole new level and a whole new Halloween audience! ******* out of **********",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
251,RebelXStar,"Michael Myers... Yeah, right!",6,10 June 2016,"As the title of the movie suggests, H20 takes place twenty years after the events of the original movie and is a direct sequel to the first two movies ignoring the 4th, 5th and 6th instalments of the franchise. Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her role as Laurie Strode, who unable to cope with the memories of her ordeal on Halloween 1978, faked her death, changed her name to Keri Tate and became the headmistress of a private Northern Californian school.As Halloween approaches she becomes increasingly anxious which affects her relationships with new love interest and counsellor at her school, Will Brennan and her seventeen year old son, John (Josh Hartnett).John is tired of his mother's stifling, overprotective ways so when she forbids him from going on a camping trip with his friends, they instead decide to stay behind and have a private party of their own inside the school on Halloween night.The people around Keri are quick to dismiss her fears and write them off as paranoia, but little do they know that Michael Myers has come out of hiding, found out Laurie's new identity and is making his way from Illinois to California to finish what he started twenty years earlier...H20 came out post 'Scream' which was the movie attributed to the revival of the 'slasher' style horror movie, after it's decline in popularity in the early nineties and the influence is definitely there. From the opening scene that throws you into the heart of the action, it's willingness to defy/revamp horror clichés and it's vaguely meta/self-aware approach.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
252,boy_in_red,All the right ingredients and yet...,6,9 August 2006,"Halloween H20 is one of those films I really WANT to like, feel I SHOULD like and yet something prevents me from truly enjoying it.So these are the reasons I feel I should like it- Halloween H20 is based on a story treatment by Kevin Williamson, who I respect for kick-starting the horror genre again in the 90s with Scream. It features the return of Jamie Lee Curtis in the role of Laurie Strode, a character we'd been led to believe was dead in previous Halloween films- bringing the story back full circle after numerous sequels.This is about a woman facing the very real demons of her past.Or is it? I can't help but get the feeling the creators of this film didn't have much faith in what is an intriguing concept. Laurie Strode has faked her own death, she has changed her identity to escape the monster that is her brother. And yet, the film, despite running for only about 80 minutes, deviates from this central idea by introducing us to generic teenagers on campus, and their ""lets get out of the school trip"" hijinks. No one especially cares about these characters, as they aren't well written or defined, and what they really do is distract from a far more important and interesting premise. And sadly yes, I am including Laurie Strode's son John in this statement.I like teen slasher films. They're one of my favourite genres. So this isn't a knock at the teens-in-peril scenario. But for this movie, it felt like filler. It felt like marketing men needing to ""target a younger age group"" rather than tell an effective story and so what we have, in my humble opinion, is a film that in many respects feels disjointed.The film is by no means without merit. Jamie Lee Curtis is an absolute joy to watch. Her transformation from hunted to hunter feels a tad too ""Ripley from Aliens"" but sadly I think it probably was due to her shared screen time restricting a more natural transition. Still she manages to create a very real character for us in the form of the jaded survivor Laurie.LL Cool J is a lot of fun also. He doesn't feel like the token musician turned actor but genuinely brings a warmth, humour and likability with him (Busta Rhymmes in the sequel Halloween Resurrection on the other hand was a downright atrocious choice) And THAT final shot. I don't want to ruin it for those who have yet to see this film but it is a powerful little twist that redeems this film for me from being completely average.

But I guess only the first one and the last one are worthy enough to be seen. Up to this date, no horror slasher movie is better than ""Scream"", not even ""Halloween"". ""Halloween 7"" presents a paper-thin plot, with elements that have no place in it. Why would Michael go to that road washroom, if he had no real need for it? The scary scenes are...well, not so scary. They are violent, but not frightening. Jamie Lee Curtis is no longer as resourceful as she was in the original.

264,Was-it-All-a-Dream,Halloween (H20): 20 Years Later (1998),6,2 May 2009,"When I take a moment to think of the greatest franchises in modern horror, Halloween does not come to mind at all. Which kind of surprises me when I pick up Anchor Bay's DVD 2-disc set, Halloween: 25 Years of Terror. I almost expected it to be an incredibly elaborate documentary with bonus features, both centered around the original film and how well it's held up, and how influential it's been, etc. But... no. It's actually about the entire franchise and its' fanbase, who are even quoted on the DVD set as saying things like, 'Michael is better than Jason, Freddy,' etc (I'm paraphrasing, of course). Well, I'm here to tell you- that's pure nonsense. I will say that Michael Myers remains more essential to John Carpenter's original 1978 masterpiece, Halloween, than Jason and Freddy are to their quite fun, scary, or pretty good films. None of which are in the same ballpark as Halloween. But the joke about Halloween is, and what makes Michael Myers come in just about last on the scale of famous horror villains of the modern age of horror, is that the entire string of sequels to that original masterpiece commit grievous acts of heresy to the original story.Jason Voorhees to Friday the 13th is a messed up character from the start and the filmmakers behind those films never have a clear vision of who he is, what he is, and what to do with him. And the films are never meant as anything more than fun slasher films. Freddy Krueger to A Nightmare on Elm Street has never been a solid character. Wes Craven had one rule and it was broken right in the original film, by producer Bob Shaye who forced Craven to change his ending to suit what Bob wanted to do to make the movie more successful with audiences. John Carpenter had a very clear vision for who Michael Myers was, he never allowed that vision to be compromised in the original film, and there was never supposed to be a sequel. The original film wasn't made for a sequel. But, Universal picked up the rights to do a sequel and paid Carpenter to write one. Only then did he realize that there wasn't anywhere else for the story to go. It was over and that's the way it should have stayed. So, he got drunk and got a crazy idea- why not make Halloween's heroine, Laurie Strode, Michael Myers' sister?Yes, it was a crazy idea. Because now you have to wonder, if he was really after her all the time... why did he waste his time stalking the other girls? So many questions arise now because of the sequel. And worse still, Part 4 went even further and decided that if Michael can't find the missing sister Laurie, Michael should hunt his niece instead. It was so stupid and far-fetched, it completely affected how interesting and valid the character was. And, he wasn't. In fact, most of the time, Michael was only playing second fiddle to the unkillable, zombie-like Jason Voorhees. When in truth, he was always meant to be more like Freddy Krueger- an incarnation of the boogeyman mythos. A symbolic figure representing our greatest fears. Ever present, dark and mysterious, deadly, quiet, and unstoppable. Making him out to be a family member killer gives him human motivation, which not even Jason Voorhees actually had. So anyway, back on the subject of the franchise. Parts II and III retained much of the style of John Carpenter's films and the cool, creepy, brooding vibe of Universal's early 80's horror films, the later sequels aimed to be more gritty and ended up being lame and boring at best.And then, Jamie Lee Curtis decided to get involved in the franchise and fix things. 1996's Scream had recently come out, Curtis got to know its' screenwriter, Kevin Williamson, and most likely went to the Weinstein brothers, the team who produced both Scream and the last Halloween sequel, and proposed a new film. A 20 year anniversary project that would finally re-unite Laurie Strode with her ""brother"" Michael for a final confrontation. What did anyone have to lose? The series had already sunk about as low as any franchise in film history could go. John Carpenter passed on directing, but Williamson did some kind of draft, and the project was up and running. Given a Scream-like makeover with a young and attractive cast tailor-made to move on to bigger, better things (most of the cast became incredibly famous much in the same way Scream catapulted everyone's careers afterward), spattered through with a few new teen horror clichés and trendy, psychologically-correct dialogue, Halloween H20 was born.And the film was a major box-office success. But, how has it held up over the years? About as well as you'd expect. Understand, the film was pretty rushed and was the cause of controversy among fans, citing what were likely over a dozen technical flaws. The film at one point drops John Ottman's music score entirely, instead deciding to recycle Marco Beltrami's score for Scream (the scene where Tatum fends off the Ghost-Face killer in her boyfriend's garage). Even if you ignore what bothers the fans (there's a huge cult Message Board devoted to the franchise), the film at best is a big budget thriller. The type of which lacks the punch a real horror film needs. And while it looks good and is mostly well acted, isn't going to give any horror fan the same creepy feel of the original, nor any sleepless nights. That said, the film has a few great scenes. The best of which clearly being where Curtis plays with her mother, Janet Leigh (of Psycho fame), as they discuss their difficult pasts. Another being- Laurie Strode decapitating that sorry sack of crud Michael Myers. A cheer-worthy moment for anyone disappointed with the awful sequels. Too bad yet another sequel, and worse yet- a remake, were to follow.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

Constant orchestral overtone gave me a headache after a while!",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
267,DJBlackSwan,Horror movies for English majors: Halloween 1 and H20,9,26 November 2005,"Bigtime spoilers in here.Ahh, a Halloween sequel even the ""Halloween 1978 Only"" Taliban can enjoy. Good casting, great stunts, funny lines, great murders (loved the hockey skates in the face) and Michael is ugly and creepy as ever.There's also plenty self-reflexive humor, from quotations of Halloween 1 most typically surrounding the Reigning Queen of Self-Parody, Jamie Lee; to elements in the score that like so many others recalls Hermann's Psycho. Look especially for the maternal instincts moment between Jamie Lee and Janet Leigh, and the recurring theme of child-parent role reversal. And who doesn't laugh to themselves upon learning that Laurie is now an alcoholic English teacher/headmistress of some school? That's what happens when screwed up Lit Major dorks grow up, apparently; you go to school, get married, have a kid (or have a kid, get married), get divorced, start your collections of pharmaceuticals and chardonnay, and eke out a living, begging inert students to quack back general-issue answers on universal themes in the works of Mary Shelley. What's this life for, and all that.Three points for setting the John-gets-busted-out-by-Laurie scene in front of the Christian Bookstore.Nit picky critiques: Beltrami's orchestral score is actually quite beautiful, nice touch reverting to the original synth score at the end. Too bad they didn't throw us poor neglected Halloween 3 outcasts a bone and have the little girl in the rest area potty hum a few bars of ""London Bridge is Falling Down"" instead of ""Mary Had A Little Lamb"". And poor Adam Arkin. Needy loverboy can barely stammer his lines, he's so clearly crushed out on his established leading lady. Very cute, portrying the juvenescent thick-thied dork, who thinks he's about to engage in some kinky roleplay game, but to the extent that he nearly ruins the critical plot point between Will and Laurie (probably as a pretense to do multiple takes), a scene that any survivor of trauma, running from infamy, trying to be normal in an abjectly abnormal world, can relate to.Finally, happily, what you think you know is going to happen to night shift novelist LL Cool J, actually doesn't, though one wishes Michael would have gotten him back for that ""tumultuous melon"" mixed metaphor...Two stars to that, anyway. 9/10.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
268,Collins,A POOR LET DOWN!,3,4 January 1999,"We've waited twenty years for THIS?!!  An hour and twenty minutes of under-developed characters who do the silly things that people in horror films are ""expected"" to do and get their asses killed for their efforts?Jamie Lee Curtis lends a certain amount of magic.  She's under used.  They have the chance to really make something thrilling here but when Michael and her finally come face-to-face, I felt a little less than excited.  Maybe that's because I'd already realized what a lame film this was by then.I think the moment I started hating this effort is when the two stupid, meaningless, under-developed must-dies showed up.  (I think their names were Charlie and Sarah.)  Instantly, you know they are going to die.  Then when they do, you never knew them well enough to feel for them.  They are sheep lined up for slaughter and, of course, that's exactly what happens.Josh Hartnett did great with what he had but the mild drama that whole mother-and-son sub-plot delivered was a little less than lukewarm by the climax.  (Which is, in my opinion, the worse cop-out I've ever seen.)Michelle Williams is (BIG SHOCK) also extremely under-used as  Molly.  A girl who just kind of shrieks and cries her way through the beginning, middle, and end of this sorry, little horror film.  I thought her character was going to some how get passed the torch but, apparently, I was dead wrong.  Instead, she....well, she doesn't really do anything.Sorry, folks.  We waited twenty years and we still don't have a movie half as good as the original.  If you haven't seen H20.  Don't.

I sat through the whole move, Loving the cast. Hating that Charlie guy! (A guy like that would NOT i repeat would NOT get Jodi Lynn 'Keefe) and Liking everyone else in the movie. You really learned to hate and like some of the characters. I liked the whole school thing where Michael was in the school, that was great, so i thought oo great! Lots of kills, but no, they end up sending EVERYONE away BUT the four main students, how convenient. Other than that, it was good.Now FOUR years later, i watched it again, and really REALLY enjoyed it. I remember when i had gone to see it with some friends (We are all Hardcore Horror Movie Buffs) and we LOVED that they made another sequel. At then end, we were almost in tears to see our beloved Mikey dead. THEN RESURRECTION CAME OUT! Not getting off the topic, i really enjoyed H20. Molly and Sarah were incredibly HOTT! I actually like Josh Hartnet in a movie for once. Jamie Lee lived again, thank God, and just the eerieness of the whole thing, walking down dark halls, Michael hanging from pipes!! Lol. This movie was great, i loved it. Anticipations for Resurrection were a little low, but i saw it, Resurrection was also a great sequel as well.

270,Drago1995,The soundtrack is what pisses me off,6,28 October 2018,I don't mind the way of the movie it's a ad sequel but still enjoyable to watch what bothered me is that they kept reusing the Scream soundtracks witch is so annoying because even the Curse Of Michael Myers just remixed the original soundtracks even if awful but like completely taking the soundtracks from another franchise and put it on this one that was a really stupid thing to do the could have done the same that they did with the Curse of Michael Myers just remix the original soundtracks and use them here they just did it with the Theme one but never reused the other.if another DVD release of this movie comes out with the original soundtracks and the scream ones out like they did with the previous one i will buy it again,Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
271,Overtheredskies,No better than Resurrection.,5,9 January 2020,"I grew up watching Halloween and this was my least viewed one, but most memorable, watching it today, Michael moves like a hyper 20 year old with his head hanging down low sometimes? KEEP YOUR HEAD UP AND YOUR POSTURE UP MIKEY! he should be built and moving slower but with a coolness, like a 40 year old man...But apparently at first, this Michael was supposed to be a copycat killer but they changed it, so no wonder he moves like a young copycat, the characters aren't believable at all except for Jamie Lee, her son I think ""Josh Hartnett""?? Acts like a stuck up girl, not just in the movie cause I can see through the script lines, but he definitely seems like a total D-Bag offset and onset! Overall, it's a copycat of Scream...They were sooo desperate to prove this that in one scene the girls are watching ""Scream 2"" from the same year almost! (1997, released about 8 months before H20) and it's somehow already on their cable TV or VHS? But I'm 90% POSITIVE this movie was filmed before Scream 2 was even available for Home Video or Cable lol! So I suspect the creators of Scream 2 and H20 were good ol pals around the late 90s, borrowing soundtracks, film clips, and even WRITERS from eachother Lol. BUT Michael Myers himself is supposed to be greater than the Scream Series, SCREAM WAS A PARODY WITH PERFECT HUMOR & MYSTERY, HALLOWEEN H20 SHOULD BE SCARY, SERIOUS, MYSTERIOUS AND MOSTLY TAKEN PLACE AT NIGHT, If I remember correctly, this film only has Michael in the night shadows during the beginning, and towards the end of the film. Yea, the original had him shown during daytime scenes but they did it to a perfect extent and we knew nothing about Michael at that point. & Last but not least, his mask is an entire different story of hate for me so...this movie is watchable even though the rest of the killing doesn't start until 50 minutes after the opening murders...Sorta just like Scream.

272,KrowbOy,The Best Halloween EVER,7,22 July 1999,"I went to see Halloween H20 in theatre's ywice and now own it on DVD and i think its the best of them all.  It really reminded me of a good slasher movie from the eighty's but had something those usually didnt...good acting, suspense, and direction.  The director is Steve Miner who also made Friday the 13th parts 2 and 3 so he knows his stuff(the opening scenes before the credits reminded me more of friday the 13th than halloween though).  The style of the movie was excellent i LOVED the way this movie looked and i think this is the second best looking Michael Myers mask in the series (the first belonging to Halloween 6).  So if you've been living under a cave and have not seen this its the best...here is my order of best to worst in the series.  1. Halloween h20, 2. Halloween, 3. Halloween 6, 3. Halloween 2, 4. Halloween 5, 5. Halloween 4,and last is ofcourse Halloween 3. MICHAEL MYERS IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE THE BEST...FREDDY AND JASON WILL NEVER COMPARE.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

Sure there were four more cookie cutter sequels after ""The Shape"" burned to a crisp in the Haddonfield Hospital. And sure slasher flix came back to the mainstream and are dying for the same reasons once again, BUT we all really can't get enough of the slow paced, mime, butcher knife wielding, crazy as a drunk hick Michael Meyers.  H20 features: some of the best dialogue in the series, fairly decent actors, suspense (maybe not the most unexpected jumps), and the best ending that any slasher flick fan ever asked for.  If there is anyone that didn't say: ""It's about GOD D@#$ TIME!!!"" at the ending of this movie, then you need your head checked.  No loose ends, no emotionally scarred potential Mask lovers to pass the flame on, And no *******SPOILER******** more Michael Meyers!!!  I am a huge fan of the series and I feel that it couldn't have ended any other way. Good entertaining movie. Like other slasher flick, rational thought is not needed to a great degree.  LL Cool J getting shot in the head and coming back only grazed? Come on. And the shapes  selective killing in the beginning of the movie (what is his criteria for his victims anyway? Can he turn his urges on and off?). So..................... Yes of course it had it's faults, but it still made me feel satisfied when it was over. Isn't that what you should feel after a movie? I think so.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
274,bjudd,A surprisingly quality film,10,17 June 1999,"Being a huge fan of the original film, I have shied away from viewing any of its sequels.  However, after seeing Curtis was reprising her role, I knew this would not be another sequel.  Why would Jamie Lee come back to star in a film unless it had some quality?  However, I approached the film hesitantly, wondering if this film would begin the decline of the horror genre.H20 turned out to be far better than I expected.  It has a taut storyline, which includes only the bare necessities.  There are only a few character, but each one is very appealing.  There is far more suspense than gore, which is evidence of a skilled director.  The most impressive part, however, is the realistic portrayal of Laurie Strode.  I thought it was very interesting and effective to show what would *really* happen to a person who went through the events of the first two films.  Jamie Lee Curtis portrays one of the most accurate portrayals of post-traumatic stress disorder I have ever seen.  This shows they were looking for more than the typical slasher pick.Jamie Lee Curtis delivers a Sigorney Weaveresque performance here.  She is fully convincing as a strung out Laurie Strode and takes on a great tough attitude.  She has lived through 20 years of torment and finally faces it with great courage.  Without a doubt one of her best performances.However, the best part of the film is its ending.  For fear of ruining it for those who have not seen the film, I will not disclose it.  However, I will say that everyone in the theater stood up and cheered after the film ended.  I read in a magazine that the ending was Curtis' response to how ridiculous many horror sequels are.Overall H20 deserves a lot more respect as a film than I believe it has received.  Miner shows precise technique in his directing and this precision allows for a very focused movie.  It is easy to follow and enjoy.  Also notable are the characters themselves.  Every move that is made is intelligent and what a ""real"" person would probably do in a terrifying situation.  I especially appreciated it that it was the two women characters that helped the wounded male characters.  Just another testament to a film trying to portray things differently.  overall, a nice accomplishment to usual banal horror genre.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
275,jason06-1,Despite all the hype about this being the best sequel Halloween H20 falls flat on its face,5,1 January 2007,"Let me say something before I begin this review. The first Halloween movie I saw was Halloween: Resurrection and it received a mixed bag for me. It was not life changing, but it was a decent piece of entertainment. Most critics and fans have labeled this as the best sequel. Why? Simply because Jamie Lee Curtis returns to her roots. Don't get me wrong I love Jamie Lee Curtis and her screen presence is strong and upholds the movie, but there are many problems else wear in the movie. The character development is nonexistent and you don't care for the characters one way or another if they live or die, save Jamie's character Laurie Strode/Keri Tate. The kids are just thrown into the film for no reason other than to get killed and Laurie's son John is only in the picture to argue with his mother. I was expecting that Jamie would be our main character and our star, but even Halloween: Resurrection let us get to know the other characters. What can possibly save this crap fest? The ending, beginning ware Sarah is killed and the other teens find her body and discover that Michael Myers is behind the killings. This ending is fast paced, a great one on one battle between Laurie and Michael, and it is one of the best endings you will find ever in a movie. Does Halloween H20 deserve all the hype it got? Certainly not, the only thing good is the ending and even that is not enough to save the film. I give Halloween H20: 20 Years Later 5/10",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
276,eric20other2002,How The Tables Turn....But Keep On Going....,6,18 July 2007,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS...........Before I review the film, I would like to say, that if it weren't for Jamie Lee Curtis wanting to do an Anniversary type film, this wouldn't have ever happened. NOW THE SYPNOSIS:(in case you just got out the rock you were under or you just don't watch these films): It's been 20 years since the events in Halloween 1 and 2(released in separate years, but all in 1978), Laurie Strode, who now goes under a different name, has a son name John and is an alcoholic and the Head Mistress of a Private School, has tried to repress the memory of how her brother Michael Myers tried to kill her and killed many of her friends. Now on the Anniversay of that night, Michael has returned to once again continue to get rid of his family members once and for all. NOW MY REVIEW.... This was the first film to not feature Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis and this is the biggest flaw for the film(he died shortly after filming Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers)and it shows. Now don't get me wrong, it's a decent film and a good addition to the series, but it tries too hard to be the original(I mean the closet hiding, the staring out the classroom window)while still showing it's from the 90's(the teenage soap opera type drama). Fortunately, Jamie Lee Curtis is in top form, with a cameo from her mother Janet Leigh(from 60's version of Psycho)as her secretary. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is a bunch of the times hottest stars(Josh Harnett and Michelle Williams to be specific). Okay, well this review is already long, but here's the short one:GOOD: Gets more involved in the lives of the ill fated children. Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode MAJOR SPOILER!!!! How Laurie Strode goes from hunted to hunter by the end.. THE ENDING!! BAD: The victims(although, it's good they have a back story, there back stories are stupid and doesn't make you feel sorry when they die) The music(terrible how they reworked the theme, the rest was just not suspenseful). The masks(yes, there were several masks used, due to Miramax/Dimension using three SPFX departments to make the masks) Leaving any reference to parts IV, V, VI out, and making this like part 3Well that's about it...If you're a fan of the series, than watch this, if this will be your first, than please NO!!! Watch the first film...",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
277,Boris_Day,The best of the Halloween sequels,7,29 July 2012,"Despite flaws Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later, is the best of the Halloween sequels to continue the Michael Myers story. Its greatest asset is the return of Jamie Lee Curtis who gives a fine performance as a now middle aged Laurie Strode. Unlike Halloween II, which gave her almost no dialogue and not much to do apart from looking scared, this feels like a proper return of the character. Her still traumatised Laurie is a believable continuation from the teenage girl of Halloween. It makes sense that this smart, bookish girl would be a headmistress two decades on. Her alcoholism and addiction to prescription drugs, resulting from her traumatic past, is well handled as is her romance with the likable Adan Arkin. There is an unusual emphasis on character development here compared to most slasher films and H20 expands in a similar way on its heroine's character as Aliens did on Ripley's, a film which clearly served as an influence.The Halloween franchise was revived because of the success of the Scream films and as a result it visually and musically resembles those films more than the first two Halloween films. The producers substituted some of the soundtrack with the music from Scream, which is odd as John Ottman's score and orchestral take on the Halloween theme is rather nice. Director Steve Miner (who produced and directed several Friday the 13th films) isn't in the same league as Carpenter and cinematographer Dean Cundey when it comes to composing for a wide screen frame. While Carpenter always placed Myers and his prey for maximum tension at the opposite ends of the frame, in Miner's film the character often seem bunched together, not making much use of the wide screen frame. The low-key lighting style and saturated colour scheme of the first two Halloween films is replaced here with the warm earthy tones of the Scream films.The film casts a couple of young actors who would go on to become two of the best actors of their generation: Michelle Williams and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Williams looks a little odd here, with an unflattering perm and eyebrows which have almost been plucked out of existence and she doesn't have much of a role. I wished they'd given Levitt, who has a brief cameo, the male lead over the pretty if bland Josh Hartnett (in his first film role, also sporting an unflattering hairstyle). I did like that they brought back the character of Myers' psychiatric nurse for the prologue, played by the same actress as in the first two films.The most irritating aspect of the film is LL Cool J's clowning. He seems to have wandered in from an entirely different film (he seems to be auditioning for the 'Barbershop' comedies) and he has been shoehorned in to appeal to a young, male audience to make up for the fact that this is the rare slasher film that centres on a middle aged female lead. He plays almost the same role as in Deep Blue Sea, where his characters fate was also changed after preview screenings.Apparently this well above average slasher film isn't well liked by many Halloween fans because it ignores the continuity of films 4-6. I've never been a big enough fan of these sequels, which keep wheeling out new members of the Myers and Strode families like some day time soap, to be bothered by that. Unlike with the copycat Friday the 13th films there is a huge gap in quality between Carpenter's original masterpiece and the sequels. This is the closest any of the follow ups came in being a decent film in it's own right.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
278,silverpinkcity,A Decent Sequel for a Flasher Movie.,7,10 October 2021,"Yes, I know. This movie contains plot holes galore. However...ignoring those inconsistencies, I feel that Halloween H20, the seventh installment in the Michael Myers franchise, is truly one of the best.I've watched it multiple times and those feelings of creepiness and suspense never go away...sort of like the way I feel when I watch parts one and two (with less-lame dialogue and slightly better hair-styles).This is the first Halloween movie where Jamie Lee Curtis's Lorie Strode is actually a (mostly) put-together adult. She has the nice clothes, the make-up...and yes, a real career as headmistress of a prestigious prep-school.She is now living in California (kind of like witness protection) under a false name so she can have a normal life again...which she seems to have achieved, mostly. She even has a surprise seventeen year old son from a previous marriage, that obviously didn't work out. Oh, the writers were certainly busy planning this one out!So yea, we have a ""brand-new"" adult Lorie Strode, rockin' short hair and form-fitting professional clothes, along with a new career and son...yet she still has flashbacks, bad PTSD, and an obvious alcohol problem...along with difficulties dealing with her almost adult son who craves some independence from her. Naturally, she's a very over-protective mom.We also have a somewhat interesting and relatable plot set out in a brand new setting (not Haddenfield, anymore) along with decent character development for a horror movie. We even have L. L. Cool J. As the guard gate and would-be soft-porn fiction writer providing us with some much needed comedy relief!Something else I notice about this Halloween installment, which makes it different from all the movies that came before...and especially the one that comes right after...is that the kids can actually hold real conversations. Sure, there's still the goofy way over-sexed guy. It wouldn't be a slasher movie without one of those. But the rest of the kids almost sound normal at times and half-way intelligent, which is a refreshing change of pace.And get this...Lorie Strode actually has a boyfriend; a nice guy who works at the school! And now we have a new venue for the horror to take place, which is the huge (mostly empty due to a school trip to Yosemite) prep school. A prep school which happens to be loaded with knives in the kitchen and even possesses an old-fashioned dumb-waiter (which you just know will come into play the moment you see it...ha-ha).The suspense is definitely back in this movie. You may even find yourself shouting at the screen, just like you did in the first and second installments. I really think this movie deserves a better score since it definitely delivers. It's also nice to see adult Lorie Strode really step it up, and not be cast as a wimpy pathetic victim, anymore.Halloween H20 is still cliché horror....it's a slasher...yes, yes, and there are those pesky plot holes. But so what? The bottom line? It's just fun to watch!",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

280,EricVierthaler92,A great reboot of the series! Jamie Lee Curtis saves the series from the god awful Halloween 6!,9,8 July 2009,"A very, very good movie! If anybody thinks this movie is bad I hope you Michael Myers will come after you! It had a very good script. It was wise for them to ignore Halloween 4,5, and 6. Because this movie was better then those 3 movies. I liked the beginning when they had the nurse from the first Halloween reprise her role in this movie. That was very interesting. I also liked in the opening credits when the flashbacks of Dr. Sam Loomis famous quotes from the original movie where said. It was by another actor but it kinda sounded like Donald Pleasence. To bad Donald Pleasence died before this movie came out. I could really understand why Laurie Strode was over protective about her son John not going out on Halloween night cause she doesn't want him to go threw the same thing she did twenty years ago. I thought that was brilliant. I liked how you saw some well known people in here. You don't see that much in most horror movies. But the music score sounded like from a Tim Burton movie. That's not really a good thing for a Halloween movie. But the music score was okay. I liked how in the end they used the Halloween theme from the very first movie. I loved LL Cool J's character. This movie really should of been the final one of the series because it had the perfect ending when Laurie beheaded Michael Myers at the end. But Halloween: Resurrection RUINED IT!!! I hate Halloween: Resurrection all because of that! You can really feel sorry for Laurie Strode for being so scared of Michael Myers and you can really understand why. And you can really understand why she has to go up against Michael at the end because he just tried to kill his son and his girlfriend and he killed her friends twenty years ago it's time for some pay back after all those years! This movie was the perfect anniversary sequel. To bad John Carpenter didn't return to direct. Why was he never involved with the sequels except for Halloween 2 and the god awful Halloween 3? Only John knows himself! I highly recommend this movie. It's the best sequel since Halloween 2!",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
281,Robin-97,"Well, at least there ain't no Druids...",4,7 September 1999,"The fact that this latest sequel stars Jamie Lee Curtis and is willing to disregard the dreadful ""Halloween"" sequels that have preceded it does not necessarily guarantee that it will be a satisfying film. Despite the fact that it has abandoned the inept plotting and filmmaking which occupied its joke of a predecessor, ""The Curse of Michael Myers"" (as I stated above, you can take comfort in knowing that there are no Druids in this time around), it has not gone the extra mile to actually be something special, and as a result, it comes across as a disappointingly mundane, forgettable slasher film. The film is loaded with plenty of nice in-jokes that could make this a potentially memorable finale to the ""Halloween"" saga (I especially loved seeing Nancy Stephens reprise her role as Nurse Marion from the first two ""Halloween"" films), but alas, the director of this material is Steve Miner (""House"", ""Friday the 13th Part 3""), who is competent enough, but hardly in John Carpenter's league when it comes to pumping up the adrenaline of an audience. His murder scenes are presented in such a humdrum fashion that you end up saying to yourself, ""is that it?"". What's most sorely missed in ""H20"", however, is the presence of the late Donald Pleasance. Without his wonderfully campy scenes of him describing the pure evil of Michael Myers, the film feels undernourished, so we end up with many overlong stalk-and-slash scenes that barely push the film up to its scant 85 minutes.However, while on an overall scale, ""H20"" is hardly a satisfying conclusion to the saga, it does come up with an ending that would be the ideal way to close off the series. Without giving anything away, I'll just say that it perfectly sums up everything that the entire ""Halloween"" saga has been about, and for the first time, makes one finally think that yet another sequel would be impossible. If the 80 minutes that preceded this conclusion had been just as strong, we might have had a really special motion picture to close off the past 20 years of slasher mayhem.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
282,Tremor,Where are John Carpenter and Donald Pleasence when you need them??,8,25 October 1998,"As far as sequels go,""H20"" isn't half bad. It rates up there with ""Halloween 2"",primarily because of the formidable presence of Jamie Lee Curtis,who returns as Laurie Strode in this seventh installment of the ""Halloween"" series/franchise. Twenty years later,the fun begins again in a small town near Haddonfield, Illinois (the original film's setting),as Nurse Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens,who hasn't aged much in 20 years),and her young neighbor Tommy (""3rd Rock From The Sun"" star Joseph Gordon-Levitt,who has the Drew Barrymore-Jada Pinkett role as the first big star to get knocked off in the movie's opening sequence),are murdered by Michael Myers as he attempts to learn the whereabouts of his sister Laurie,who vanished from Haddonfield years earlier. Where has Michael been since that fateful night in 1978 when he and Dr.Loomis (the late,great Donald Pleasence,whose presence is sorely missed in this film) presumably died in a hospital explosion? It is explained that Loomis survived,and was nursed back to health by Marion,but where the hell has Michael been hiding,since sequels 4,5 and 6 have totally been ignored (rightfully so,since Parts 4 and 5 were mediocre,Part 6 was just plain awful!....but hey,they're better than any of the ""Friday The 13th"" sequels)? So upon learning of Laurie's location,Michael proceeds to drive to Northern California for a final showdown with his sister. Laurie is now the alcoholic headmistress of an exclusive coed prep school, where her brooding son John (Josh Hartnett) is a senior. Curtis's real life mother,Janet Leigh of ""Psycho"" fame has a cameo as Norma (a name obviously inspired by ""Psycho's"" Norman Bates),the school's maternal secretary (she even drives the same car that her character, Marion Crane,did in ""Psycho""). L.L.Cool J. shines in his role as Ronny,the school's security officer (now the ""token African-American role"") and aspiring romance novelist. Michelle Williams is excellent as John's girlfriend Molly,who possesses some of the same heroic traits and intelligence that an 18-year-old Laurie did 20 years earlier. The scariest moment in the film is when a young woman and her young daughter are cornered by Michael in an abandoned rest area bathroom. They are surprisingly spared,since Michael only wanted their car! The film's final showdown between Laurie and Michael is terrific. Where the film does falter is in its three remaining supporting characters...Adam Arkin as Curtis's boyfriend Will,Adam Hann-Byrd as John's friend Charlie,and Jodi Lynn O'Keefe as Charlie's girlfriend Sarah (why would a knockout like her date a geek like him,we'll never know!)...they are simply written into the script as victims,their murders aren't even inventive. The woman and her daughter at the rest area were far more interesting than these three...I was wondering,what was their story? Why were they at the rest area anyway,in the middle of nowhere? Why did Michael spare their lives? Overall,the film possesses more strengths than weaknesses (Jamie Lee Curtis is in top form...nobody cusses like her!). My score: *** B (7 out of 10).",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
283,chrisgriffintv,Unsatisfying mess sprinkled with a lot of 90sness,4,8 May 2021,"Perhaps being more overrated than the original Halloween, H20 has a boring opening, a total overdose of 90s tropes and an everchanging mask design. Michael Myers comes across as weak and stupid in this Halloween outing, rather easily being defeated by Laurie Strode. Laurie herself is kind of just meh with nothing really interesting about her but her rather severe PTSD she picked up. Michael Myers death in this one is very overrated, audiences should not have been tricked by his decapitation in this film. Overall this entry, while probably not the worst entry in the Halloween franchise, fails to deliver. Edit: My review of this earlier this year was unfair. It is alright and it did save the franchise from what would have been a terrible Halloween 7. Rating upped to 6 from 4.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
284,Seagalogist,"The best of the Halloween sequels/remakes by far, but that doesn't say much.",8,24 February 2010,"Let me say, this is a strong slasher movie. It has all the elements one expects and a hint of nostalgia with tween slasher queen Jamie Lee Curtis reprising her role as tormented object of the slasher's affections. However, she plays a stronger woman this time around and that was a good move, considering she's a mother now and needs to be strong for her son (played by a young Josh Hartnett).For a slasher movie, the acting is acceptable, definitely above the standard. The kills are good and Michael Myers is his usual sinister self.Where this movie falls down is simple to identify. Remember a small movie by the name of Scream? Remember Scream 2, I know what you did last summer, Urban Legend...the list goes on. You see what I'm getting at here? Now you can add Halloween H20 to that list. It just follows the same framework as those movies, but with less blatant humour, which again was a smart move. Humour + Michael Myers (not to be mistaken as the guy who played Austin Powers) = FAIL. So kudos to H20 for providing us with a silly title, but a solid movie that slasher fans will enjoy.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

286,1001,Slash and burn,4,5 January 1999,"Halloween H20 doesn't even come close to replicating the magic of the original. Its only value lies in the promise that, due to its ending, there will finally be an end to this dreadful series (excluding the brilliant original, of course). There is a bitter irony in the recent renaissance of horror movies; the phenomenon began because of the success of the two Scream movies, but those same Scream movies, with their post-modern, self-referential comment on horror movies, have made straightforward horror movies obsolete. Yet all we're getting is straightforward slasher-type horror movies. Given Kevin Williamson's virtual monopoly on the recent glut of horror movies, I'm led to think the only reason he's making so many is to give work to a new stable of young hot stars, who will owe their careers to him, thereby giving him control of a great proportion of Hollywood 10-15 years down the road. Hey, there's a good idea for a horror movie! Remember, you heard it here first.Halloween H20's plot revolves around the return of Michael Myers, after 20 years! to haunt his sister Laurie Strode, now underground after faking her death and changing her name to Keri Tate. Michael Myers is sure in good shape considering he must be approaching late middle age, he must be an aerobics instructor between periodic forays into knife-wielding madness. The return of Jamie Lee Curtis as a struggling alcoholic, tightly wound, overprotective mother is actually a good idea. She does a good job in her role.The problem lies on the side of evil. When you look at the first Halloween movie, you will see that Michael Myers is not just a slasher - he represents metaphysical evil. He works like real evil works, ie, he lurks in the background, waiting for his opportunity to pounce on human vulnerabilities and times of weakness. Real tension is built by his omnipotent presence, by real evil, not fake jumps and false starts, like H20 uses all the time. Plus, the movie uses Michael Myers like a regular slasher, but who can't be killed. But he can't be both; he must either be a human being who can be killed, or figurative in a sense, like in the first movie. Hence H20 is contradictory to its own premise, and further hence, loses all real tension. The movie also doesn't spend enough time building to its climatic finale, we're there before things even get started, it seems, so there's no sense of tragedy either. I can only wonder what Wes Craven could do with this material. He's the only one who knows what to do with the horror genre. I would recommend seeing A Nightmare on Elm Street again, and watch for the sense of tragedy. It's there.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

It is then up to Laurie to face her biggest fears and stop him once and for all.""H2O"" has a great opening scene and an action packed climax. The film's budget is the largest of any HALLOWEEN film to date and because of this, the film has some epic scenes. I know that some music from the SCREAM series was used, but the soundtrack, in my opinion, is great and different from the other films in the series. The performances are really strong and the film has some suspenseful moments.I really love this film and it is sad that the following sequel ""Halloween: Resurrection"" is nowhere near as satisfying.The film isn't perfect and I would have loved it if the action packed climax was longer as the film's running time is quite short. And I wish that the film had only used one mask for Michael Myers. But the positives far outweigh the negatives.A great film that ""saved"" the series and made Michael Myers a pop culture phenomenon.

Laurie returns to the screen once more, for the last stand. YES, THE LAST STAND. I don't count ""Halloween: Resurrection"" as a proper sequel. The writing is just brilliant, as well as the acting. The movie didn't have much gore either, which is a good thing. The original didn't have ANY except for the beginning.My only problem is, what was Michael doing in the 20 year gap? And how come it doesn't seem like Halloween 2 had anything to do with it? I don't know, but I just love this movie. Some of the key elements of the 1st one aren't included.

289,MaybeTomorrow,Underrated,8,28 January 2007,"Excellent but very underrated sequel to the first 2 Halloween movies. The film ignores Halloween 3, 4, 5 and 6 and picks up 20 years after the events of Halloween 1 & 2. Jamie Lee Curtis returns as heroinne Laurie Strode for the third time but this time with an assumed name: Keri Tate. The film is directed by horror-veteran Steve Miner (director of the excellent sequels: Friday the 13th 2 & 3).Curtis' performance is very strong and really makes you feel for Laurie Strode. She's haunted by and struggles with nightmares of the past. The rest is short and simple: Michael Myers returns with only one purpose, killing his baby-sister Laurie. In order to protect not only herself, but also her son (played by Josh Hartnett) she has to make a choice: Keep running from this evil or face it and finish it off, once and for all! The final battle is awesome!A very good film, especially after a few so-so sequels. There are two things i did not like about this movie. One: Michael's mask. It's ugly, not scary and doesn't look like the original at all. Two: Michael is very small. He used to be a big guy. What happened? 8/10",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

Also, this is the 7th Halloween--don't they know how to make them GOOD yet?

This could have, and should have been something to end all the endless, mindlessness of the series, especially because Jamie Lee Curtis was involved, and even suggested it to an extent but lo and behold...we have to deal with that jerk-off Kevin Williamson of ""scream"" fame with this one. He produces this one, I think, and he made darn sure that it mocked his stupid ""scream"" sensations to the T! You know what? I bet Jamie Lee Curtis is utterly ashamed of this one. Its hardly surprising. Same old stupidness with dumb characters, dumb actors, and horrible dialogue that is supposed to represent the ""in with the times"" teenager fan fare and it's just stupid. We have the famous, iconic Laure Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) in a different life with a new ID, trying to raise a son that apparently has been dealing with this bad memory of hers for about as long as she has. UGH! We don't give a rats butt about some lame son who offers nothing headaches galore, and you know what else? the mother-son story plays out more like Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong in T2! I'm not kidding I swear I could mistake Ms. Curtis for playing Sarah Connor in some scenes. Anyway, the former Ms Strode runs a school (surprise surprise), where lame teens with no brains attend. On Halloween, 1998, Mr. Myers comes a knockin' for dear Laurie...20 years later. There is an attempt at alcoholism to give Laurie some depth, but it's just too ridiculous to say. Curtis has always been a great actress but to see her acting alongside a bunch a bad, no talent actors and writers etc (Minus a cameo from her beyond fantastic mother) is not what a Halloween fan wants to see. I think it was all fixed. This movie is a ""scream"" movie guised as a ""Halloween"" film, and you know what? Everybody knows it. It is nothing new, nothing original, and certainly NOT a real ""Halloween"" movie. Hell, a woman with out clothes who gets killed by Michael Myers, after enjoying a night of hot sex is more apt to being alongside the original Halloween than this! This is ""scream mockery"" and a really bad one at that. It barrows scream score by that ludicrous Marco Beltrami, and has a lot of naughty words and weird teen lingo as uttered in a scream movie.

297,antoinecatry,Why ?,3,17 May 2010,"Beware : this review does not only contain spoilers, but also some far-fetched questions and even sarcastic remarks. When confronted with the task of writing a sequel to a horror movie franchise, writers must come to terms with two types of tricky questions, very much pertaining to the same logic. 1)In the rare cases of ultimate episodes (eg. A Nightmare on Elm Street 6), what way will they find to terminate the evil guy when their audiences have been used to him always rising up ? 2) When the audiences have been convinced of the stalker's death at the end of the previous film, how will they explain anew his «survivability» skills ? That power of conviction is all the more important an effort in Halloween 20 because the killers rises up precisely 20 years after the last we've seen of him in H2. I will not consider H3, 4, 5, 6 because they are so out-of-the-subject and sloppy (I will not even try to review them), despite the talented contribution of late Donald Pleasence. Why 20 years ? Let's be serious, in the first Halloween, Michael Myers was capable of driving without any lessons (that is essentially the only unexplained thing about him in Carpenter's film). Yes, but we also saw him credibly revisiting his childhood playground in Haddonfield, lurking silently behind the bushes and in the shadows, studying thoroughly his victims and the theater of his killings, knowing when to strike best. In H20, Michael Myers reappears without warning, even if Dr Loomis blinded him and burned him at the end of H2. He does not stop his prowesses here : he is as well capable of finding the location of his doctor's former assistant, Mrs Chambers. I guess he looked in the phone book for her address, or maybe he used the Internet, well without any home or computer, how could he ? Perhaps his talkative ways did permit him to enter a cybercafé and asked to browse ? That only confirms Dr Loomis' original hypothesis of an incarnation of the Antichrist, malevolent and omniscient. Harder to believe, he precisely decides to spring from his den 20 years later, and around Halloween. Perhaps some tribe found him in the woods and tried so desperately to cure him than all they could think of was putting him in a cryotube and programmed the alarm clock exactly on Halloween 98 and even included a GPS and complete data about his future preys in his brain ? Every viewer with a bit of judgment knows it is because Jamie Lee Curtis did not want to play in a horror film before, maybe her commercial failure in the Fierce Creatures comedy convinced her to return to the role that made her famous? At least, she was better convinced by producers than they convinced me of the plausibility of this sequel. Apart from those far-fetched considerations, I thank Steve Miner for he had the decency not to find replacement for Donald Pleasence. I also agree with the decision to terminate the slasher and the series, that is good at some point when we realize most films have been disastrous; but it should have been done with better writings, in order to explain the long wait, and so on (read what precedes these lines); a genuine and solid rock trilogy of horror could have been written, if H2 had not ended on November 1st... Back to this film: in a few words, it disappoints me when I rediscover it. Michael's teasing lost much of its scariness. JLC may be good but the kids have nothing as unforgettable as PJ Soles or Nancy Loomis. Everything happens so quickly as if they wanted to kill all was left of the previous films (Mrs Chambers, mainly) apart from Jamie Lee in order to close rapidly the franchise. Mission failed in many ways, the writers may lose their hair finding very improbable, and often stupid, reasons to resurrect the monsters, we are stupider to pay for tickets in theaters when they hit the screen... If I recall correctly, H20 is one of the 2 or 3 last B movie I've seen in theaters with Land of the Dead and some other.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

I avoid horror movies like the plague because I am a wuss and cant stand watching brutal and gory murders being carried out,but Halloween H20 is so poorly performed that not even an in-line skate wedged into the face of a teenage hockey player could frighten me. Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Laurie Strode/Keri Tate and her crazy brother Micheal Meyers is back to terrorize her,for another Halloween.Hot young talent Josh Hartnett makes his impressive acting debut as John Tate,the rebellious 17 year old son of Curtis who is sick to death of living under his tortured mother's thumb and yearns for independence.The fact that he is the nephew of a psychotic killer doesn't phase him.Dawson's Creek actress Michelle Williams performs decently enough as Molly Cartwell,Hartnett's intelligent girlfriend,who soon learns her boyfriend's family secret. The real highlight of H20 is the scenes that call for characters to scream blue murder.You'll either be on the edge of your seat,with your heart racing,or like me,doubled over in hysterics.I first viewed this film in the early hours of the morning and managed to wake my house up with my laughter,which is surely an indication that Halloween H20 is not bone chillingly frightening.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

So first off, I'm aware this is a 90s film and this is certainly depicted within the first scene, you don't need to look up the era to know the era since the cast give that away and well, it just has that 90s film style vibe about it. I got a lovely nostalgic feeling for sure. As it progresses, I noticed there's quite a few jump scenes, which are indicative of that era of horror and definitely a ""Scream-esque"" style of filming with its camp comedy horror. Which, you can love or hate, I loved it, but for those devoted fans, I could see how this may feel a bit cheap and perhaps let the franchise down a little. Jamie Lee Curtis is back as the protagonist and so too is that glorious theme tune. It starts to pick up pace before the grand meeting of Laurie and Michael. And you're then back to the good vs evil show down between them both. It pays homage to the first one in many scenes. As a follow on from Halloween 2, I feel this one holds up and if you base it off the conventions of horror in that era, it certainly is classic entertainment.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
302,David N.,Colour me surprised,7,17 March 1999,"After seeing the first ""Halloween"" and not thinking much of it, I was apprehensive about the sequel.  However, bad title aside, ""H20"" was an enjoyable slasher film that interested me more than any of 1998's other teen horror flicks.Jamie Lee Curtis is reason enough to see the movie.  As the alcoholic, paranoid Laurie Strode she brings humanity to the film, something that the slew of god-awful slashers like ""Urban Legend,"" ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,"" and ""Disturbing Behaviour"" neglected.  A film is worthless if the audience doesn't have anything invested in the characters; everybody knows that.  I cared about Laurie and didn't want to see her new life stripped away from her.Watching the obnoxious couple getting massacred in the kitchen was enjoyable, as was poor Adam Arkin's death.  Man, in this movie and on ""Chicago Hope,"" that guy gets no respect!  Thankfully, the movie didn't focus too much on the students at the prep school; this is Jamie Lee's film and it is much better that way.There are slow bits and a few horror movie cliches (and what's up with LL Cool J's appearance at the end??), but ""H20"" is infinitely preferable to other 1998 slashers.

303,Clay-Pigeon,A Sequel for True Halloween Fans.,10,2 November 2002,"In my opinion there are two types of fans of this series; 1. Halloween fans: Which are the true fans of the original. The ones who appreciate the suspense and intelligence of John Carpenter's classic. 2. Michael Myers fans: The ones who might as well be watching a ""Friday the 13th"" flick because all they want is to see Michael kill off people in the most pointless and graphicly violent manner. Halloween 4-6 were made strictly for the less discriminating Michael Myers fans, which is why they were so awful. Thankfully Kevin Williamson and his crew came along and finally made a sequel for us fans of the original and far superior Halloween. It had story, good characters, style and suspense but best of all it had the returns of Jamie Lee Curtis and Nancy Stephens who were obviously brought back to put some dignity back into this butchered series. So, Michael didn't kill a load of people and there was no gore, who cares? That's why Jason Voorhees was invented. People need to realize that Halloween was originally a suspense thriller in the tradition of Hitchcock and not a lame popcorn horror flick. That's why this is the best of all the sequels, it went back to the standards of what made the first so great.

Tonight He's Back!The sixth Halloween film, came and went in a blink of an eye. It was a waste of time for everyone involved, including the audience. With it's troubled production, re-shoots and complete reworking of the story the movie ended up failing on virtually every level.Since the late 80's it seemed that that slasher film itself was dying. They weren't performing as well, if at all, at the box office and their stories were getting more contrived and unoriginal with each passing film. By the mid 90's the slasher film had all but died and very few were being released or even slated for production.But all that changed in 1996. One movie was released and brought new life to the slasher film. That movie was Scream. Not only was it highly original, but it was scary, really funny and a well made homage to the original Halloween. It was a huge hit with audiences, raking in box office coin and shot new life into the slasher film genre.Right away a new slate of Slasher films went into production and were released as fast as possible. I know What You Did Last Summer and Urban Legend are just a few that came out in the wake of Scream. Jamie Lee Curtis had seen Scream, and realizing that Halloween was approaching it's twentieth anniversary, she approached it's writer to help her develop a new Halloween film starring Laurie Strode. And so, on August 5th, 1998, with slasher films enjoying new life, Halloween returned to theaters with Halloween H20: 20 Years Later.H20, it turns out, is the best Halloween film since the original. It is well directed, well acted, funny, scary and enjoyable from start to finish. It stars Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, a cast of young talented actors, Janet Leigh of Psycho, and Nancy Stephens who reprises her role from the first two Halloween films.In regards to the story, this film is a continuation of events following Halloween II. Parts four to six are thrown out the window and are treated as though they never existed. Laurie has faked her own death and is living under a fake name in a secluded town as a head mistress of a private school. She has a son, a boyfriend and a cabinet full of medications that help her get through her days. And of course, Michael Myers comes after her and her son.Right away H20 recreates the mood and tension that the first Halloween film was so good at. From the opening shots the audience is aware that Michael Myers is there, even without seeing him. And when they finally do, he is lurking in the shadows and backgrounds, teasing his victims and scaring the audiences, again just like the first film. Even though H20 is a little gorier than the original, it mimics it's style perfectly and makes for a very fun and scary ride.Unlike some of the previous Halloween films, especially the sixth one, H20 got Michael Myers right. He hasn't seemed this scary or real since the original. His mask looks perfect, his body language is perfect and his walk is as menacing as ever. Credit goes to the man behind the mask, Chris Durand, as well as the director Steve Miner (who directed Friday the 13th parts 2 and 3). Miner does a terrific job directing and mimicking the style of the first film. Balancing humor and scares together is not an easy feat but Miner pulls it off with aplomb. As well, he and the writers have included nods to other films including Scream and Psycho.The film is nicely shot with smooth movements and great eerie lighting. The sets are realistic and the gore and effects look very real. The music is great and makes the pulse race, and plays around with the Halloween theme in new and exciting ways. And the editing is smooth and flows together well within the constraints of the story. There seems not to be a wasted frame in the 86 minute run time of the film.It's a shame that Donald Pleasance wasn't around to make this film. Watching him as Loomis, along side Curtis as Strode would of been the greatest thing since sliced bread. But what we get instead is a well made sequel that was (if you don't count the alternate storyline) 18 years in the making.H20 is fun and scary and funny and enjoyable and it delivers on all levels. It is well made, has great death scenes, great acting and a great story. And unlike most of the previous entrants in the Halloween films, it has a definitive ending that wraps things up nicely. And like most of the previous entrants in the Halloween films, it leaves you wanting more.Film Rating: 80%Breakdown (How Halloween H20: 20 Years Later scored 80%):Production Design: 7 out of 10 Cinematography: 7 out of 10 Re-playability: 9 out of 10 Originality: 8 out of 10 Costumes: 8 out of 10 Directing: 8 out of 10 Editing: 8 out of 10 Acting: 8 out of 10 Music: 9 out of 10 Script: 8 out of 10Check out all my reviews at www.fullmetalreviews.blogspot.com",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
312,generichorrorfreak,Great ending to a great series,8,2 October 2010,"Or it should have been, as the highly unnecessary sequel Halloween: Resurrection was a pile of puke. Anyways, H2O is enjoyable in just about every way. The ""victim"" characters are realistic and multi-dimensional, Mike Myers is as stone-cold as ever, and the movie is suspenseful in its entirety. You'd imagine seven movies in that it would get old, but no, this is a great watch and a great ending to the saga of the cold-hearted killing-machine monster of a human that refuses to die no matter how many stabs, bullets and falls he's taken.Oddly enough there are a few heartfelt moments in the film, however not too cheesy and not so powerful you want to cry. Definitely adds a great touch to the horror of it all. And even though teen characters tend to be one-dimensional and bland in 90's/2000's horror films, the ones in H2O actually have some personality, yippy skippy! Laurie has developed a lot from the teen in the first couple of Halloweens but remains a likable and solid character that you root for, and kicks more butt than ever in this one.And finally you get some closure with Mike Myers (although it's taken away again with puke-pile Resurrection). Overall this is a GREAT horror film - the first Halloween remains the best but as far as sequels, and especially endings to a long-running series, you couldn't ask for anything better. Too bad the Elm Street series couldn't have gone this route.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

314,denis666,The Scariest Halloween and the Best Michael Myers Ever.,6,22 January 2005,"Yes.This was the first Halloween i watched.It was very creepy to see Michael for first time.I didn't know who is he until H20.Well i watched 5,6,7 and Resurrection and i can't find the others.Now about H20.The most important is that Laurie Strode is back.Thi is the only Halloween movie that does't take place in Haddonfield.Now the movie begins with a nurse killed by Michael and two more kids who are her neighbors are also killed.Well the movie is scary but if we talk about Body Count-it is awful.Only 6 death scenes and 3 of them are off screen.Well the 3 we sees are great but this is a Halloween.It is a slasher and we expect at least 12-13.We saw more than 15 in The Curse and now it should be more but now.This is the only bad thing about H20.A lot of good characters.As i said,a lot of scares and GREAT job by Chris Durand.He is the reason this movie to be that good.He is scary and his movements are terrific.Josh Hartnett is playing Laurie's son-John.His girlfriend Molly is played by Michelle Williams.The story is that Laurie changed her name to Kary Tate and she is teaching students.She is fall in love with one man.Will Brenan played by Adam Arkin and more characters like LL Cool J who plays the guard of the school Ronny.Lauris is scared that Michael can return for the 20th anniversary.John want to go to Usemety with his friends but she doesn't let him and much more action.I recommend this movie to all real horror fans.Great movie.I give it 6/10.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
315,steveneven,Maybe it takes Curtis to make a decent sequel,5,4 July 2014,"I'm assuming you know the shtick. Fast-forward 20 years since Michael has disappeared from Haddonfield, and perturbed little Laurie thinks Michael Myers is now roaming around California. But her son John is going out for a trip with his friends, and Laurie goes to protect John from the dangers of Michael Myers! The minute I saw the words ""California"" flash over the screen and ""20 Years Later"", my preconceived notions were starting to get the best of me. But me being a non-biased film critic, I settled those notions pretty quickly. It wasn't too hard considering the opening scene was actually quite perfect for a movie like this. And who could resist cute little Joseph Gordon Levitt? Anyway, ""H20"" keeps surprising us with some familiar faces as the movie follows us to Josh Hartnett's school. There we meet Michelle Williams and LL Cool J. This doesn't take me out of the film, but their performances get some points from me. All were actually pretty good in their roles, and believe it or not, these characters were actually pretty likable.So so far we're on to a fresh start. A cool opening sequence, some fine performances, but... then nothing happens. The movie tries to get us to care about Laurie's boyfriend, but we really can't. There's just no development, even though he seems like a sweetie. And he comes off as more of a rebound than anything. And then the movie tries to have us feel for Laurie and John's mother- son relationship, but again, their relationship isn't fully fleshed out for us to truly root for them when they're in trouble. So we have these likable characters, no doubt about that, but then we ask ourselves ""What do we know about them?"" And unfortunately, we can't answer that question.But, right around the two thirds mark is where the body count begins, and once the count begins, director Steve Miner does something a little neater than the previous ""Halloween"" directors. He racks up the suspense and throws a lot of teasers at us (like Michael Myers' shadows), but what's detracting about this are the absence of truly great kills. Maybe sans the last death, but considering its context, it seemed a little too-good-to-be-true, but still a solid kill nonetheless. So with ""H20"", it seems like Miner got some things right, while others he didn't get so right, so what's the verdict?""H20"" might not be the best sequel as everyone claims that it is, but that's actually a good thing. I'm one of the few that actually liked ""Season of the Witch"" and I still think ""Halloween II"" really plays out like a direct sequel to the first movie. ""H20"" might be sandwiched in between those two for best sequel, or it might be behind, but does it really matter? What matters is that this is definitely one of the more suspenseful movies in the series, it moves at a faster pace, and Laurie is back to wipe the floor with the bad guy in town. But what also matters is that this movie is not so scary like some previous installments, it plays out more like a cat-and-mouse game between Laurie and Michael, and the deaths just don't live up. All in all, I'd give ""Halloween H20: 20 Years Later"" a solid 5 with all the pros and cons generally canceling each other out.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
316,TomServo-17,Halloween used to mean something.,3,20 July 1999,"In 1978 John Carpenter made a slasher film rivaled only by Psycho, Friday the 13th and a few choice others. It was followed by five inferior sequels (even one that had nothing to do with the plot of the first film!). They all did a grave injustice to the classic 1978 film. Or at least, that's what I thought before I saw ""Halloween: H20"". Halloween was actually a great series until 1998. It has succumb to the teensploitation horror film genre. Other examples of this include Scream, I Know What you Did Last Summer and Disturbing Behavior. Granted, I wasn't born when the first Halloween film came out, but I sure have seen it enough times to know that H20 is a freakin' disgrace, rivaled only by ""Psycho 2"". As far as Halloween films go, don't expect too much of this one. As far as horror films go, A rediculous ending (which, by the way, I thought of before the end of the first movie) makes it just another stupid slasher flick with no point. As far as films in general go, You'd be better off with A Clockwork Orange. But that's just my opinion.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
317,savagerocks,"Better than the ""Curse""",6,18 September 2007,"Movie has the distinction of being Better than the ""Curse"" of Michael Myers.Some clever in joke references to Psycho was a nice touch. I expected this to be a better movie though. Directed By Steve Miner of Friday the 13th fame. Steve Miner has directed some good movies, Friday the 13th wasn't one of them. This movie is better than some of the sequels. You can't escape getting the feeling of deja vu when you see this. It offers no real good scares and it's probably not the directors fault. There is a cool chase sequence in a banquet hall. The movie doesn't use shadows to it's advantage though. And Michael Myers coming down from the ceiling didn't really work for me.It is a better movie than part 5 and the Curse of Michael Myers so it couldn't be all bad,right?",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
318,vooheesv33,Halloween H20,8,17 September 2010,"Besides the extraordinary performance by Halloween 2, my favorite sequel. Great comeback for Laurie Strode ( Jamie Lee Curtis). When her unexpected son, that wasn't in any other movie. What happened to Laurie strodes Daughter? But who cares she was a downer child. 20 years after the Halloween massacre, Laurie strode is still haunted by it. Suspense is written all over it. Michael kills you in anyway possible.

319,Straff,So much potential and so little of it fulfilled!!,4,1 May 1999,"When I first heard about the release of this episode of the Halloween story I was excited at the prospect of another horror masterpiece, similar to that which we received in parts one and to some extent part 2 aswell. After watching the film though I felt cheated. There's no new ground, no new scares, I hate to say it but it was very, very predictable.The film looks very similar to a high budget American 'made for t.v.' film and generally fake from the outset. To its credit though, the film does start relatively brightly though and you do experience chills up and down your spine during the first scare but after that it all goes downhill into mundane, cheesy Hollywood standardised scare and kill shots.The story is slow and you wish that you could wind it up or drag it along at times, after all you know exactly whats coming, the ultimate match up between brother and sister. Even when this climax arrives you feel cheated and disappointed, you watch in anticipation, yet you are able to predict who is going to jump out of where and when.Even though I feel this slating of the film is justified, you are not that disappointed when you leave the cinema though. It does have its pluses along the way. The acting from the main cast is of a high standard, as you would expect with some well established actors and some that are on the brink of major Hollywood stardom.For anybody has seen one or both of the first two parts of the Halloween story then this film is worth seeing because it closes everything out and all lingering doubts are removed. For a person who is watching this film as an individual piece of work they will wonder what all if the fuss is about and thinks the film is bog standard horror.So much potential and so little of it fulfilled, bummer.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
320,MJive,What about H4 - 6?,6,20 September 1999,"I'd say Halloween: H2O is a 2 and a 1/2 star movie--pretty good for a slasher movie, especially a slasher movie sequel.  It is pretty scary and the characters are well-developed.  What bugs me so much about this movie is the total disregard for the past three sequels.  There was a pretty good running storyline in Halloween 4 through Halloween 6, and H2O just pretends the events that took place in those episodes didn't happen.  Aside from that, I'd say H2O is better than Part 5, but definitely not better than Parts 4 or 6.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

322,shaneschoeppner1,The Revenge of Laurie Strode,10,26 March 2008,"Thirty years ago, when fresh-faced Jamie Lee Curtis debuted on-screen as Laurie Strode in John Carpenter's ""Halloween"", horror films and horror fans seemed to have been just waiting for her to arrive. She was like a breath of fresh air. The face of horror films had recently been refreshed by George Romero, and zombies were all the rage, and while Tobe Hooper's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", Bob Clark's ""Black Christmas"", and Argento's work were ground-breaking and successful, they were generally considered either too extreme or too 'artsy' to satisfy the American mainstream. Disaster flicks and monster movies like ""Jaws"", ""Grizzly"", and ""Earthquake"" were very popular instead. Then, quite unexpectedly, ""Halloween"" hit, and here was something that we hadn't seen in a while - a contemporary retelling of the damsel in distress theme. Beauty and the beast. Good against evil. As a result, Michael Myers has become one of the most iconic faces of evil in all of filmdom; but there is never yin without yang, never dark without light. Laurie Strode was the light to Michael's darkness, the counterpoint to his violent and hostile nature. We needed her to survive Michael Myers' holiday attack; somehow we felt safe with Laurie, reassured by her, and at the end of the film she reminded us that good can triumph over evil. We loved her from the moment we saw her. And she instantly became a hero to me. (The same goes for Jamie Lee Curtis herself; she has shown her strength and talent in many other roles, and in her personal life is outspoken, hard-working, dedicated to motherhood and family and friends, and refreshingly candid and honest.) ""Halloween"" saw Laurie Strode go from babysitting victim to victor at the hands of escaped psychopath Michael Myers. Along with Dr. Sam Loomis (the always-delightful Donald Pleasence) she compelled us to watch the horrors in Haddenfield. Laurie's selfless ways with her young charges, her concern for the welfare of her friends, and her tenacity and wits in dealing with a faceless slasher, were inspirational to us all. In ""Halloween II"" Laurie returned for another go-round with Michael, and we learn that he is actually her brother, which brought the creepiness level up and intensified her plight. Once again she survived, and watched Michael burn in a raging hospital explosion. She arose victorious, and again we cheered her on. Twenty years after ""Halloween"", Curtis returned to the role that made her a household name, and a terror-film icon. Laurie is now a functioning alcoholic, and has a teen-aged son named John (Josh Hartnett) who refuses to believe her seeming delusions that Michael Myers is still alive and a danger to them both. She's not sure herself what is real and what isn't, and her paranoia is affecting both her relationship with her son and her romance with handsome Will (Adam Arkin). But around the time of John's seventeenth birthday, Laurie's paranoia and edginess prove to be legitimate - Michael has found them, and he'll stop at nothing to kill them both. A few fresh-faced actors round out the cast, but this is Laurie's story - her very catharsis - all the way. Jamie Lee Curtis gives the performance of a lifetime. When push comes to shove, she proves once more that she can rise above her fears and fight for herself and her loved ones. It must be said that the ending of ""H2O"" is one of the best in horror film history. And when she swings that fateful axe at Michael in the last shot of the film, beheading him, she puts to rest not only the overly-long ""Halloween"" franchise, but also our own fears. Laurie Strode is a folk hero, a savior, and something like an old friend. After putting her troubled past behind her, today Laurie Strode lives a quiet but happy life somewhere in the United States. She does not wish her whereabouts to be known.**Forget ""Halloween"" 3,4,5,6, and 8.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

Jamie leecurtis thought of the idea of creating this movie, and se did 3 great things for doing so!1. It brought the movies back to where it belongs! 2. created best sequal yet 3. gave me my favourite halloween of them all.I have heard fans say the reason they dont like this movie with there fan devoted halloween movies, is because it isnt set in haddonfield, it had to much family relationsions and last but not least takes to long to get into, and there isnt to many deths and michael is to soft.But for me thats what i like about this movie, wherever this movies settings are concerned it doesnt bother me, family-relationship's is what creates characterization and makes us (the audiance) feel simpathy for the characters; i also dont think it takes to long to get into, or maybe it is probably because the movie was so interesting. And michael isnt soft, he just didnt need to kill people forno reason, they arn't his family so why does he need to kill them?? he doesn't and blood doesn't equal scare so they isn't no need to add that for the content. so if you havn't seen this movie, do so, it did good at the box office, engrosed a lot of money and is an instant classic!I also liked the idea of making it an anniversary to the first movie and set 2o years exactly towards its original.And thank god it was a better movie than 4.5.6 but they are still great movies! Chris Durand plays the best shape out of them all, he really gives the movie that great feeling where he is the evil brother, and when watching this movie you really think his sister laurie strode wont win as not many people survive michael through three movies, The mask in H20 is a better one since the original. Great characters, acting, editing, directing, and sound quality. The movie is truly a must see for any fan, and people really need to concentrate and get into the movie to really give you a memorable feel. So if your looking for a good horror movie then see this, as most people go to the halloweens to enjoye a horror as it is the king of them, but if there is any sequal see this, it has one of the if not the best fight at the end of a horror film, the ending fight is a classic and the movie earned its famouse (face to face carnige thorugh the window) scene. The ending climax is great and will leave you on the end of your seat. So this is a must see and shouldnt be missed. The filmakers did a great job and this movie has a lot going for it.I give it a 10/10!",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

It reeks of his cheesy dialogue, and his unbelievble one-dimensional chacaters. In this movie, Myers tones it down on killing and is chasing his sister again. But wait, wasnt his sister presumed dead. No she faked it and somehow had another child ( remember Jaime Llyod, the cute little girl from halloween 4-5-6, I guess Laurie dumped her off and started a new life, great mom huh?), and, get this, she got her teachers degree and is the headmaster of a private school. Well Micheal finds her, and stalks her, kills her sons annoying friends, and kills her annoying boyfriend. Exciting aint it. Not! Avoid unless you are very bored and dont mind being p**sed off by dumb characters and a once hard-core killing machine go soft and Hollywood.

It retconned the events of the previous three films, and picks up twenty years after Halloween I & II. It's like a fresh restart, and the quality improved tremendously. I can't explain what it is about entries 4-6. They have this indescribable quality about them that makes them feel lacking in quality. They felt rushed, poorly made, and just kind of ugly to look at. But not this one. This one is good, and restores my faith in the series. Well, I mean it did. Jamie Lee Curtis is back, and she beats the absolute hell out of Michael Myers, and officially offs him. It's an ass whooping for the ages. I didn't quite like their treatment of Michael Myers. He didn't feel as scary, his mask was bad as always (I say as always as it's now a trend to make the worst mask possible for the character), and he's a puny dweeb who gets whupped by his little sister. He's still better than the version if him in Curse, but he doesn't quite fully redeem himself either. The movie also tries way too hard to be hip and ""in."" It's like it wanted to be Scream, a superior slasher flick that revitalized the horror genre two years before H20 came out.

They weren't even sure if they wanted to see it, but Halloween H20 proved to be truly ""shocking"". Halloween H20 is by far, the best sequel. First of all, Jamie Lee Curtis comes back, and that just made it all the more sweeter. Secondly, even though it was only for about 10 minutes or so, Nurse Chambers returned as well before getting killed by Michael. Now, this film likes to forget Halloween 4, 5 and 6, and that is the main reason why some fans dislike it but that doesn't bother me. The way I see it, Laurie has a drinking problem due to the death of her daughter Jamie and fear that Michael may still be alive. The film is totally reminiscent of the first. It pays many homages to Halloween 1 and even Halloween 2, in one scene with Will's death. So, Halloween is definitely my favourite sequel by far. It was fantastic. The fact they brought back Jamie Lee Curtis just automatically made it amazing. Michael went back to his normal style. He wasn't slow and robotic, just a normal man, with normal movements, but still stalking and creeping like the first. The body count isn't high at all, but that is no problem. The suspense, setting, plot is all there, just like the first. I find H20 to actually be the scariest out of them all, just that dark secluded school and Michael lurking in the shadows is terrifying to think of and I even had nightmares of this film that made me feel creepy. Halloween H20, I don't think had a ""Scream"" feeling to it, it is just like the original. Fantastic. 10 out of 10. Best film of the 90's. In my opinion anyway.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

H20, despite it's stupid but funny title, is the best sequel of the Halloween franchise. disregarding every movie after 1981's Halloween II, H20 should have been the end of the franchise.the movie takes place 20 years after Halloween and Halloween II. Jamie Lee Curtis' portrayal of a deeply traumatized and haunted Laurie Strode is beautiful. Steve Minor, known for being among the many directors in the Friday the 13th franchise, delivers on every aspect in this movie.my only complaint about this movie would have to be Michael Myers' mask in some shots. during the production about 4 masks were used - one of them being a horrible looking CGI mask, presumably put on during reshoots of scenes. if these were left out or edited better it would have been so much better.what really makes this my all time favourite Halloween sequel is the action-packed ending. Laurie finally confronts the evil that is her brother, taking matters into her own hands. this is really portrayed so much better than the 60 year old Laurie in Halloween 2018. this Laurie did it first - and better. the film's eventual 2002 sequel Halloween: Resurrection, in my books, doesn't exist. H20's ending is so powerful that it negates any sequel after this.anyone who reads negative reviews of Halloween: H20 - give the movie a chance. it is a real treat, still 22 years later.

However, Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her role as Laurie Strode. The acting in the movie is great. Even L.L. Cool J was good in this movie. I can't believe the people who hate this movie. What's there to hate? The acting is good. The script is great. The deaths are good too. My favorite death scene is that guy at the beginning of the movie.

339,ginnymason,Better Than It Has Any Right To Be,8,10 December 2018,"After watching the disappointing David Gordon Green's Halloween, I decided to rewatch this 1998 sequel that has a vaguely similar premise - Laurie Strode confronts the man who terrorized her as a teenager.I hadn't seen the film since it was first released in the summer of '98 and I remember enjoying it, but certain things really bothered me. The cinematography was too glossy and bland, the music score was cribbed from Marco Beltrami's work from the Scream films (among others), Michael's mask kept changing throughout (and even worse - none of the masks look even remotely scary), and the film felt like it was in a bit too much of a hurry to get where it was going and could have benefited from a slightly slower pace at times.Upon re-watching it, all these things still bother me. Halloween H20 is far from a perfect film, but it's certainly a hell of a lot better than David Gordon Green's Halloween.Case in point: Laurie Strode. Green's film has Laurie depicted as a nutty recluse who lives out in the wood, fires guns, booby traps her house, and alienates her family because Michael Myers might, one day, return. This Laurie is murky at best. We never get to really sit down and talk with her about her past, therefore, we can't really understand why she's so insane. She's fairly unlikable and uninteresting to watch. You don't see a character grow or mature. She's fixed in stone and nothing will change her, even when Michael does actually return. She's a fighter from the get go and you never have any sense that she's not strong enough to win in the end.In Halloween H20, Laurie has changed her name and gone into hiding as a teacher at an elite prep school in California. She's self-medicating with pills and booze and startling overprotective and smothering with her son. She's even in a relationship with a kindly guidance counselor at the school. This is a Laurie who's fighting to keep it together. She's on the run and active. For me, this Laurie represents most survivors of PTSD. They're not stuck in a shack somewhere. They're among us, hoping that we don't see how messed up they really are. It's far more powerful to see someone scared of breaking down at any minute. Jamie Lee Curtis' performance in this is easily some of her best work.Director Steve Miner understands suspense from his work in the early Friday the 13th sequels and he brings his craft to several nail-biting sequences. The grand finale when Laurie turns the tables on Michael could stand to be extended a bit more, but it's a genuinely exciting and satisfying conclusion to the franchise (if you simply pretend Resurrection never happened like most sane people).H20 is most definitely worth another look.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

342,todge169,Very suspenseful,9,11 April 2000,"When Scream kick started the horror genre again, it was only to be expected that there would be more of them.  However this film is different because this is a sequel to the film that really started the slasher genre.(Not counting Psycho)  H20 takes place twenty years after the original Halloween. Laurie Strode is now known as Keri Tate and lives with her 17 year old John while working as the headmistress of a secluded private school in Northern California.  However the memories of her maniac brother Michael Myers still haunt after all this time and so she has become an alcoholic and spends each day hoping and praying that her brother won't come after her for revenge.........but this year he does.  There are two main strengths to this film.  The first is Jamie Lee Curtis returning to the role that made her famous and watching her go from a fearing and overprotective alcoholic to an all out end of tether vengeance seeker is just what the film needs to show the effects these shocking events have had on her.  The second is the writing.  After four dreadful sequels, one of which had nothing to do with Michael Myers, they finally took the Halloween franchise back to it's roots, back to where it all started with Laurie and Michael.  The dialogue is sharp and witty and of course as with most modern horror films has a few in jokes which you can tell were the ideas of Kevin Williamson.  Scream 2 is seen playing on a television and in one inspired scene, Janet Leigh (Jamie's real life mother) gives Laurie some ""maternal"" advice when she says ""We've all had bad things happen to us"" which of course is a reference to Psycho.  The film is very suspenseful and has more than enough blood to keep the gore hounds happy.  I really do hope this is the last one though as it is finally a return to form for the series and it has a brilliant ending(which I won't spoil)which I think finishes the series nicely.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
343,prehensel,Decent Enough,6,24 June 2007,"So I'm watching this movie, and I'm thinking to myself that if you're ever being stalked by Mike Myers and you happen to be with Jamie Lee Curtis, a point in your favor is that she's been here before: she knows what to do, and she has her stuff together to fight a madman. Of course, what's working against you is that she's the star, and you're not, so odds are that you're going to be killed in a rather unpleasant manner.Overall, this installment of the Halloween series is okay. I appreciate what they're trying to do with the misdirection (like the garbage disposal scene); most of the interesting plot twists and kills have been explored within the slasher genre, so the only way to manufacture suspense is to subvert expectations by killing the characters in ways the audience doesn't expect. It's an interesting reversal, really. Of course, Mike usually prefers to stay old school and kill with his trusty butcher knife (unlike Freddy or Jason), but this film sets the audience up to think the kills will be done differently and then subverts that expectation via butcher knife. It works for the most part.There are, of course, new elements to this flick; for instance, the goth girl kill was terrifically shot--the kind of dark, *Hostel*-esque cinematography and set design you don't expect in a slasher flick, especially in the Halloween franchise. There were some great homages to previous films (the goth girl kill is reminiscent of the girl zombie in *Dead Alive* hanging on the light fixture; and when Keri/Laurie is fleeing Mike, opens that door, realizes it's a closet, and screams ""oh f#@k!"", it's a wonderful inside joke to those familiar with the original *Halloween*.But lest you get the impression that this film is without flaws, let me point out what made me roll my eyes in disgust. First and most obviously, this film took way too long to get rolling: the action doesn't start until almost an hour into it, and before that it's mostly Keri/Laurie fretting about John or freaking out and John struggling to deal with his mom's neuroses while still being the coolest kid without really trying. That's not fun to watch. Also, the original mask (which was a modified Cpt. Kirk Halloween mask) was scary, but they went and messed with it in this version. It had poofier hair and shadowing on the face: that ain't right. Some plot elements were just stupid: I understand that if you're Keri/Laurie, at this point you don't believe that Mike is dead, but even I know that stealing his body isn't going to end well for anybody. (And what bad luck to steal the only van in the world that has plate glass as the windshield). I really can't believe they made a sequel to this one. At this point, I think we're all in the same boat with Laurie: just let it end.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

Still having visions of her supposedly deceased brother and turning to pills and alcohol to cope with her problems, Jaime Lee once again proves to be astonishing. Seeing Jaime's real-life mother in the film, Janet Leigh, as she waves goodbye saying ever so sweetly, ""Happy Halloween,"" as she walks toward the same type of car she drove in ""Psycho,"" was classic. And how perfect is it that she is named Norma (after Norman's mother in Psycho). And how we loved hearing ""Mr. Sandman,"" during the opening sequence.

346,mswelles,great movie!,9,17 October 1998,"I saw ""Halloween h20: 20 years later"" a week after it opened. This is the best sequel since #2.My mother and I went together, and we got lucky -- we were the only souls in the theater that night.I was very shocked when my mother, who can't stand horror movies, loved it. I did too.There are a few of the ""cheap scares"" -- someone jumping out of nowhere accompanied by a loud burst of music -- but even those get a little scare out of ya. There are a lot of very suspenseful scenes in the last half or so of the film, and I guarantee you will be on the edge of your seat. The scene where Laurie (Jamie Lee) stares into Michael's eyes through the small window on the door sent chills up my spine. It was very effective, I'll say that much.The acting is top-notch, considering the actors are only given about 85 minutes to do their job. Jamie Lee is fantastic (as usual) and plays the role of Laurie Strode with emotion, style, and of course, attitude (you've gotta have one to battle a psychopathic murderer). The supporting cast also delivers, particularly Adam Arkin (Laurie's sensitive boyfriend), ll cool J (the laid-back security guard with marriage problems), Michelle Williams (Laurie's son's girlfriend), and Josh Hartnett (Laurie's son).The score adds just the right touch wherever it is needed, and it doesn't remind me of ""Scream"" at all, like some have said. The original ""Halloween"" theme is played in bits throughout the film, but it is probably most remembered in the opening credits, which are very impressively done, by the way. There's also about 5 seconds of the song ""Mr. Sandman"" (played in the 1st ""halloween"") heard.All in all... ""H20"" is a very, very well done film, even with John Carpenter absent. It has impressive acting, style, a great score (and impressive opening credits), a few laughs, a little bit of drama, and of course, *a lot* of suspense, scares, and fun.I give ""h20"" 9 out of 10. great fun!

The 90's oozes all over the place with the horror cliche from that era (Scream, Urban Legend, I Know What You Did Last Summer etc etc)
This is my opinion, if you like this film then more power to you.
To me this film feels nothing like a Halloween movie, it lacks the atmospheric October/autumn vibes, for some reason it feels like Myers all of the sudden walk on the set of Dawson's Creek...The movie kinda worked back in 98 when i first saw it, the hype around this flick was huge, but after i re-watched it a few times and the years went by, the movie only got worse and worse (for me)Note: Just because a movie is getting old doesn't mean that it's bad, far from it.
I love movies from all the way from the black & white era to the 80's, but some movies just... doesn't stand the test of time, in this case, H20, for me.
The late 90's was not the greatest era in my opinion.The teens, the score (rip-off of Scream) the school, the none Halloween/autumn spirit makes it feel like a very typical random 90's slasher with Myers just thrown in there to make it a... Halloween movie.
The mask also destroyed it for me, but that didn't came as a surprise, did it?
The awful CGI scene... Why?
They should have just left the scene, those few seconds out of the movie instead.The first two original Halloween movies will always be the greatest ones in my opinion.

However, the rare length of the film was appalling. Under an hour and a half. They could have used that time to develop the plot, and could have had much better and more action scenes.

Until now. Halloween H20 is a fantastic film. Unlike other films of this genre, it realizes that you need to care about the characters in order for the film to scare you. Gore does not equal terror. The original Halloween knew that and H20 knows it. It allows you to get to know the characters so you can root for them in the end. Unlike the Scream-type movies of today, teenagers are not the only ones with brains here. Jamie Lee Curtis gives a performance superior to her one in the original. Her character was destroyed from the events of the first film. We get to see her rebuild herself as she finally faces the fear that has haunted her for 20 years. Kudos to director Steve Miner. He creates a perfectly creepy atmosphere, allows Michael Myers to move like a person instead of a robot, and throws everything but the kitchen sink at us in a white knuckle ending. This is the first horror movie I went to in a long time where the audience SCREAMED with regularity. There were more screams in the last half hour of this movie than there were in SCREAM 1 & 2 combined. My only complaint is the over use of false scares.

Just nothing like it up til then, truly visceral. Now, H20 is no Psycho, but it was my first introduction to Michael Myers and probably the gateway drug to all things horror for me. I remember being really scared. On the one hand it's entertaining - there's the stacked 90s cast, very on-brand / of-the-times script by Kevin Williamson (of Scream fame), and plenty of homages to the original. On the other hand, there are some truly frightening murders - it does not skimp on the gore - and the famous Halloween theme adapted into a haunting orchestral score is just uncanny. I'll admit I have my thumb on the scale rating H20 an 8 because it is near and dear to my heart, but it deserves to be higher than it is.

'II' was just bloody and, even according to Carpenter, useless. 'IV' was a travesty; 'V' was a step up, albeit a small one; 'VI' was confusing and pointless. 'H20' does continue the original Carpenter storyline and throws away the plot line of 'IV', 'V' and 'VI' - thank God! With the emphasis on suspense rather than effects (although there are some well-done effects), 'H20' finds the right kind of balance the original 'Halloween' had. No, it is not as scary or shocking as the original, but it is definitely a worthy sequel. And, without Michael even going into space. Whew!",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
364,Pete-17,Another shameless sequel,1,13 September 1998,"John Carpenter (creator of the original 1978 horror classic ""Halloween"") must be doing one of two things: a) laughing his head off at this bore of a horror film and enjoying the royalties, or b) kicking himself for not doing it himself.  The only thing that allowed me to survive the 90 minutes of sheer boredom was hearing Carpenter's original ""Halloween"" score, albeit transplanted from the original, being played over and over.That's right, the movie is only 90 minutes long, and (not including the pre -credit sequence murders that try to get the proverbial ball rolling) not one person dies until an hour in.  But there are plenty of Kevin Williamson -style false scares (he doctored the script and served as exec-producer) but they get old really fast.  Janet Leigh (of ""Psycho"" fame) makes a cute little cameo to play the maternal character to real-life daughter Jamie Lee Curtis for a scene, but she really serves no purpose to the film.The bulk of the movie takes place at the prep school Curtis runs which is situated out in the middle of the boondocks--perfect place for Michael Myers to get a few more practice killings in, right?  Hence, all those false scares.  And there is the little introduction of Curtis having changed her name and no one knowing her relation to the Michael Myers murders, except her son does know and it doesn't really factor in.""H20"" was originally scheduled to have the traditional Halloween opening but it was finished so fast they decided to push it up to summer so as to get a better chance of a profit.  My advice: they should have spent more time on developing a truly scary script and taken their time making it.  A lot of potential wasted there.  And they would have had the perfect opening day, too.  Halloween is on a friday this year.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

The only decent motive I've ever seen in a movie was John Doe's in ""Se7en"".  I guess I shouldn't expect a decent answer from the same people who thought seven sequels would be a good idea.  What exactly is Michael going to do if he kills all his relatives?  Get a job in a factory?  I wish they would kill them so there wouldn't be anymore Halloween movies.  How can someone watch the same man kill the same type of people, the only variance being the weapon, over and over and over and over and over and over and over again?

But one area where it is weak is the mistake of not tieing in parts 4-6 with this one.  That would have gave the film more depth in my book.

370,brean_381,Good and Dissapointing at the Same Time,10,15 May 2002,"Well as much as i looked forward to seeing this film, i have to say it did a miserable job of living up to the original. It was a good sequel, don't get me wrong, but i liked the Producer's Cut of Curse of Michael Myers better.It's weakest point to me was the music. I mean John Ottman did a noble thing trying to orchestrate the music but in the process, we lost the feel of it. it just didnt feel like a Halloween movie to me. Sure there were parts that brought back memories but nah, not like the original score by a long shot.Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Laurie Strode and has developed quite a bad mouth on her. It's another aspect where the feeling for the character was gone. AND NOT ONCE DID IT PLAY LAURIE'S THEME!! Just thought i'd throw it in. I also hated the fact that parts 4-6 were ignored.
It was a overall decent sequel but could have been better. I give it 2.5 out of 4 stars. Email me with comments.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
371,bowers4,Average,7,19 August 2001,"First off let me say that I love the Halloween series. All of the movies have something special about them, this movie also has that. The only good thing about this one was the last 15 minutes between Michael and Laurie. The rest of this movie is pure garbage! I almost fell asleep. The movie is about as slow paced as Pearl Har-bore(4/10). The acting by all of the teens is horribal. Josh Hartnet is the only decent one. Michelle Williams can't act like she is scared, and she did so well in the one Dawson's Creek episode. The gore is low. But the worst thing about this movie is that Kevin Williamson did a re-write. He thinks that just because Scream did so well that a classic series has to have that touch. The refrances got old with Scream 2. He should really try something original. So just fast forward through the first hour and ten minutes and get ready for a good time. I gave this 8/10 just for the last 15 minutes.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

374,TheShape,What a way to go....,4,14 August 1998,"Nothing can top the original Halloween.  It set the standard for every horror movie since.  So to compare any movie (including H20) to the original is ridiculous, but I will.  Carpenter's original was a stroke of genius.  Miner's H20 falls short, very short.  Miner tried to recapture the first, and in some fleeting moments succeeded.  Where Carpenter uses false scares and red herrings, Miner uses them as cheats.  A cheat for anyone who doesn't know is when music/mood is used to build tension and the payoff is a cat jumping out, etc.  Miner does this throughout.  One final note, whoever cast Chris Durand needs to get their heads examined.  He's a terrible Shape/Myers.  Durand portrays Myers as a excited kid.  Whereas Castle's (original) Shape is calm and subtle in his movements.  He's a man with a motive - cool and calculated.  My only wish for this movie (H20) is that Curtis would've produced, or Carpenter would've directed or both. All in all H20 is worth seeing if you're a fan, but if not, wait for video.  Until then, to tide you over, check out the original Halloween again.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

The ending sequence was basically perfect when Michael's head got chopped off. It was like a relieving moment for the Halloween series and should have been the last. This Halloween wraps around the first and Second and completely ignored 4,5,and 6 which I agree with. This movie is about Laurie trying to forget her 20 year old memories of Michael Myers. When he finds her under her new name Kerri Tate where she lives in California and is the head Mistress of a boarding school. It's either she faces her fears of him or she will sacrifice her son(Hartnett), his girlfriend(Williams), her boyfriend(Arkin), and her security guard(Cool J).The cast was very good choice, in which included Jamie Lee Curtis! And it had a good script with allot of terror. It is also the best selling Halloween movie to date. THIS IS DEFENATLY THE 2ND BEST HALLOWEEN EVER!

Get any Halloween film except H20 or Halloween III.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
378,critcguy,*** (out of ****),7,12 July 2002,"Overall, I really love this movie.  It has some truly memorable sequences (including when Michael chases Hartnett and Williams through the woods and into the school, then Laurie's eye-to-eye reunion with her brother, and OF COURSE the explosive ending which gave me chills all the way through the credits).  I am also glad that Jamie Lee Curtis agreed to be a part of the film (Christ, it was even her idea!).  But, this isn't to say that the film doesn't have flaws...OK, I admit it: it DOES have a teen horror movie feel to it (i.e. SCREAM). I personally think they could have done better with a little bit darker of an atmosphere, but at least this way it still has entertainment values that non-horror lovers can appreciate.  The re-done score is also not as dark as HALLOWEEN fans would've liked either, but there are some OK moments reminiscent of the classic Carpenter theme.Still, a GREAT horror movie - especially for the 90s, of which it just could be one of the better slasher flicks of (along with WES CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE and CANDYMAN).  Even the hard-core HALLOWEEN fans - who generally didn't like H20 as much as the rest of us - shouldn't rate this movie as 5.3!  It should AT LEAST be in the sixes, if not mid-sevens.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
379,RaidonHyobanshi-1,Halloween H20 makes the perfect trilogy,7,15 August 2007,"Halloween H20After the rather dismal Halloween II, I was wary about going to see Halloween H20 but it turned out to be a much better film than I expected and the perfect wrap up for a trilogy.Halloween H20 takes a good route in which it ignore's part's 4-6 which were terrible films. Instead it continues twenty years later after the first two films in which Michael Myers thought to be dead in a fire has returned for his sister Laurie Strode who has been in hiding for all this time. She has a seemingly perfect life with an intelligent son and a dedicated boyfriend, a great career as the headmistress at a private boarding school in Northern California; however she is far from happy. The tragic events from 20 years previous still haunt her mind, and strongly take effect on her parental capabilities. To everyone, this is ""just another Halloween"", however Laurie still lives in constant fear. But Michael has returned and tracked her sister down and starts killing her co-workers and students one by one. And for the first time in two decades, they meet again. Laurie manages to escape, but instead of leaving, she chooses to to back, in an attempt to restore her life, to the school to challenge Michael in a fight to the death. She finds him and attempts killing him several times. She manages to push him off a balcony, causing him to fall to his ""death"", similar to the first film. As the police load up Michael in a body bag and put him into a coroner's van, Laurie steals the van and drives off into the night where Michael still alive escapes the body bag and lunges for her. She slams on the breaks, throwing him through the windshield, she unsuccessfully tries to run him over and instead tumbles over a cliff but she manages to escape the van but Michael is pinned to a tree. He reaches out to her, she reaches for his hand but pulls back remembering everything he's done to her; she chops his head off with an axe .. the terror finally put to rest.The acting in this film is very good, especially by Jamie Lee Curtis who delivers a powerful performance as the tortured Laurie Strode, Josh Hartnett gives a strong performance in his debut film and Adam Arkin plays a good all round nice guy role. The film keeps the suspense of the first film and unlike Halloween II manages to keep a good pace and not dull down, the plot of this film was simple and worked. The music in this film is hard to comment on due to a lot of it being scream which was a minor thing that bugged me, but the opening Halloween Theme was brilliant and very chilling.The film is a little gorier than the first and second films, but doesn't go over the top by any means. The biggest highlight of this film was the final confrontation between Laurie and Michael and the chase scene in which Michael eventually comes face to face with her sister for the first time in twenty years.To sum it up, I suggest if you have seen the first two films then see this film as it is a good horror film in itself and a perfect end for a trilogy.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
380,angeljuuhachi,okay...another Halloween film..,1,29 December 2002,"Halloween H20, as probably everybody knows, is another sequel to Halloween 2. Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis) is now the headmistress of a private secluded school. Out of fear that her brother, Michael Myers would get her, she changes her name to Keri Tate, and the only person that knows her identity is her son, John. Michael finds Dr. Loomis's files on Laurie and discovers where she is living and ect. He then goes after her and her son on Halloween. She's ready for him this time; however now he's stronger than ever. Now for my opinion on the movie. To me, this movie is a little less than average for a few reasons you probably read already. First: Halloween was an eerie movie with a quiet, careful, and apparently indestructable killer. In this movie, he's more like Jason than Michael. The movie doesn't have the same feeling as the older ones. Michael is still quiet, but he's kind of careless, and a total superhuman. They make him stronger and stronger in each movie, and that can get annoying. In H20 he kills everything he comes across, with the exception of the two people in the bathroom. It's just not ""Michael"" like. Second: I, like almost everyone else, was disappointed with Laurie Strode not being in H4, but I really liked that little girl, Jamie. H5 wasn't as good, but I still thought it was pretty good. H6 had some good points, but ranks as one of the lower ones on my scale. I was pretty unhappy with the fact that H20 and Resurrection completely ignores H4-6.  At least in H4 they have an explaination for Laurie's disappearance. H20, like 6, was trying to be too much like Scream or Friday the 13th. The characters annoyed me, and even though Curtis does a good acting job, I didn't like how they made Laurie.  And just like another review says, I was just waiting for the characters to get killed off. Despite it's problems, H20 has decent kill scenes, pretty good acting, and some overall well done scenes. I'd say see this if you're bored looking for a movie for a Friday night and you spot it on the video rack and the Rental Store. You might like it more than I do, but rent it before you buy it.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

The 4-6 people, the H20-Resurrection people, and the people who like them both. I'm sorry, but give me a break. Some people are only judging on the fact that the plot changes between these.Well, at least it keeps it interesting. Each one is missing something, and each one had something. 4-6 was missing Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie Strode), and H20-Resurrection was missing Donald Pleasance (Dr. Loomis), Haddonfield(Uh..) and Danielle Harris(Jamie Lloyd.) I'm just saying this;(even if my little 'review' is jumpy and confusing.) Don't hate these movies just because it strays away from the storyline, and don't hate 4-6..or, uh, 4 and 5(Okay, I liked 5, kill me.)just because it goes into the Celtic legend Thorn and it doesn't have Jamie Lee in it.

It was cool in the beginning when Michael goes back to Haddonfield and breaks into Laurie Strode's house (i think) and kills the house sitter. The movie starts going really slow after that, it gets stupid after Michael gets into the School and Laurie's son is having a Halloween party in the basement of the school when he should be going to some camp trip or something. Then you find out Michael is not going after Laurie, but her son. Not much of a bad storyline, but they made it pretty bad. The Series was saved however when you found out Michael didn't get decapitated in the beginning of Halloween Resurrection. That was good. I guess you could see it, but wouldnt consider it.

395,stanfaliski,Water? Not the Boogieman I used to know.,1,18 October 2007,"This is my 2nd comment on a movie since I've joined this site, and believe me, there are a hundred other movies I'd like to talk about rather than this one. I could start from the title itself, H20. Just saying it to myself makes me want to slap whoever said OK. I'm sorry, but, when someone says H20 in a sentence, I think ""water"", at least I used to. Now, when someone says it, I think of this terrible movie. I know its an abbreviation for ""Halloween: 20 Years later"", but, come on, for real. I know the franchise was failing and it would've been easier to promote the film without people turning their heads before they could get the full title out of their mouthes, but for all of us followers of the story it was hard to believe we were about to see something impressive. I overlooked the bad title and gave it a chance. Fortunately, the movie goes by just as fast as saying the title.I guess I was naive to think the story could get much better. The original film by John Carpenter and its sequel was a great story with a beginning and end. The third was a different story completely that had nothing to do with Michael Myers, which was a great move for being diverse and giving others a chance to tell different stories that take place on Halloween. But, with the first two being box-office champions, and 3 being mediocre, the studio lost interest. So, years later they bring back Michael, which brings back money. At this time, I was old enough to sneak out of bed to watch these movies, and I was mostly in it for the Boogieman. As I got older, so did the Myers story. Part 4 was a decent approach at the continuing story involving Laurie Strode's daughter. Laurie apparently killed herself after her daughter was born and so her little girl is already damaged goods. The ending was a gruesome cliffhanger kind of like the original. Part 5 starts where the other left off and on to the normal killing spree and ends again with another cliffhanger that doesn't get summed up till' years later where there is another decent story that almost has a decent climax except for the fact that he's not dead, which only means he'll get dished up for his 20th anniversary.And that leads us to this fresh pile of pooh. So, Laurie Strode didn't kill herself but faked her death to avoid the past and the possibility that big bro Michael might have survived and come looking for her. This was also done to protect her son. I'm left to assume that her daughter was just the decoy for her mom and brother. Nice parenting, not to mention excellent continuity. I love how studios are the only ones who forget past story lines, or at least, they think that since they've had a few let downs at the box-office, we just kind of forgot what happened. Since I can't leave an 0 for a score, I have to give it a 1. I don't mind. I'll give it a 1 for killing Michael the way we knew he could be killed. Chop his freaking head off!!! Enough is enough!!!

396,emineric,phony michael myers,4,12 August 2001,"halloween h20 is the worst halloween sequel to date(i don't even regard halloween III as part of the series).  there are a few simple reasons for this.  A:  it completely disregards anything that took place in halloween 4, 5, and 6.  2:  jamie lee curtis (laurie strode) is alive despite the fact that she was revealed dead in one of the sequels.  but i guess that goes along with point A.  which brings me to point D: this is the point that really chaps my ass, michael myers does not act like michael myers.  one of the reviews i read said the director gives him the ""freedom"" to not act like a robot anymore.  like that is supposed to be a good thing????  that's half the evilness of his character, the other half of course being that he hacks innocent people to death.  taking away his patient, uncaring, methodical way of destruction is like taking away his mysteriousness.  he might as well be another crazy schmuck off the street the way he was hanging from the rafters and darting his head all around like some SCREAM villain.  what did he do take some gymnastic lessons in the offseason, come on now.  michael myers is supposed to walk menacingly while the victims run, and still be around every corner to surprise them.  i felt he was way out of character in this film and i'm hoping that this was some sort of friday the 13th: a new beginning spoof where it's not really michael doing the killing, and he'll reappear in the next one up to his old antics.  i'm hoping they'll disregard this movie, much like this one disregarded 4,5,and 6.  but i noticed jamie lee is in the next one, so i'm assuming they're going forward, instead of looking back like i had hoped.  my words of halloween wisdom:  michael myers is not meant to fly around like he's some kid from a scream movie.  he is supposed to be EVIL, nothing more, nothing less.  don't tarnish his character again, please.  my advice to potential viewers:  watch this movie just in case it has something to do with the next one, just don't expect the same michael.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
397,huntleydevonte,"Good, but not great.",5,22 July 2007,"I think this was a good film. But at the same time, it was also a disappointment. It ignores Parts 4-6, which made the series a lot interesting and keeps you thinking, ''what's gonna happen next?'' each one of those films added something to the story. Not repeating the same thing over again. This film offered nothing new to the story, other than the return of Jamie Lee Curtis. I think they should have done this movie a lot better, and should have picked up where 6 left off. That would have made this movie more interesting. I wished they could have done that. I mean, what was the point of ignoring those movies? They weren't bad at all. They were terrifying, and creepy, and each one of those three films ended with a cliffhanger. This movie feels much like Scream, which is making this movie be hated by a lot of people. I think the producers or directer, or anyone could have did this better. They should stuck with Kevin Williamson's idea. Steve Miner made the wrong choose for this movie. He should have included Parts 4-6. They are the films that held the series together. This movie is good in all, but could have been a lot better.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

I know there will be people out there who will disagree with me, but H20 is a huge step up after the mundane and quite frankly strange cult offering of Halloween 6.
As always, Jamie Lee Curtis is superb and supported by a great cast including Adam Arkin, Josh Hartnett and LL Cool J. H20 has some good kills, though not as many as the other Halloween films and a great plot with edge of seat suspense.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

The idea of bringing Laurie Strode back brought the movie back to life, a few famous names (Ll cool J) also made this movie thrilling. I liked the idea, of when Josh Hartnett and his girlfriend in this movie bring climax, when they are running away from Michael especially the scene with the whole key and gate thing.The whole thing of him being still alive in Halloween 8 really destroyed the franchise of it, and Laurie strode dying really surprised me.

404,movieguy-20,Halloween: H20 **** (Better Than The Original),10,9 August 1998,"Returning to the classic style of John Carpenter's 1978 classic, ""Halloween: 20 Years Later"" (abbreviated H20 in advertisements) does what few films ever have, it IMPROVES ON the original! This is hard enough to do with a 1st sequel to a decent film. But ""H20"" does it 5 sequels after one of American cinema's greats! How does it do this? The first thing to recognize in a success like this is director Steve Miner (who took his first stab at directing with ""Friday the 13th Part Two"") who understands that the point (no pun intended) of any good horror film is to scare the audience, not gross them out. His brilliant usage of false scares and red herrings make it so that when Meyers first appears on screen you jump ten feet out of your seat! And he doesn't attack then, he just walks into the freakin' room! To be able to set up suspense like that requires talent, Carpenter had it, and Miner has it, and because of that, this is the most suspenseful horror film since the first ""Halloween"" 20 years ago. Other factors not to be ignored are the tour de force performance of Jamie Lee Curtis as she returns to the roll that she was born to play, and John Ottman's moody, terror inspiring treatment of the ""Halloween"" theme. The most important thing about this film is that it is brought closer to it's roots, back to the eerie style of ""Halloweens"" 1 and 2, leaving the shock treatment goriness of sequels 4, 5 and 6 alone, in fact, never acknowledging there existence. ""H20"" is a landmark film in it's genre, a genre, which, if it can keep producing films like this one and the ""Scream"" series, will be around for a long time. If the quality remains high, the only thing I can say is more power to em'!",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

407,Skald,Something wrong with this movie,4,2 November 1998,"Let me start by saying that I've never witnessed the original Halloween, nor any of its sequels until H20. I enjoyed this movie for its suspense and the acting and all that, but there was one thing wrong with the movie - the apparent immortality of the killer. Now come on, first he gets hit in the back of the head with a fire extinguisher. This has got to hurt, if not dislocate your spine. He then gets up, unharmed, and walks around pointlessly until Jamie Lee buries an axe in his side. Bye bye liver, kidneys, intestines, etc. But no, he removes the axe with nothing more than a soft grunt. Jamie Lee stabs the killer about 8 times in the chest, and pushes him over a balcony with the kitchen knife in his heart. Later on, he gets thrown through the windshield onto the road, then smacked by Jamie Lee's Ambulance van. If that isn't enough, he's thrown down a hillside until he lands, upright, on the base of a tree. The van rolls down and absolutely minces him, but he still is alive. Jamie Lee finally chops his head off, but not after he reaches out to her, displaying his consciousness. Now we can guess that a crash-test dummy when hit by a van travelling at 150kph (93 mph) is going to be obliterated, then why does Michael survive? If my observations are incorrect, it was probably due to a lack of light when filming.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

I like the whole idea of her finally facing her fear of her brother, Michael Myers.

Everyone was in such a good mood, it really didn't matter. I enjoyed watching the audience's reaction almost as much as the movie.  I have not had fun in a theatre like that in a long long time.  This is the reason movies were made.  In the tradition of the John Carpenter original, the movie excites us with suspense , rather than images of gore and blood.  Well, the hockey skate seen was an exception.  I would reccomend this movie highly for anyone with a sense of excitement, and particularly for any Halloween fans.

Director Steve Miner (Friday the 13th 2, 3) does an excellent job with suspense and startling scenes.  Many of the suspense sequences are done brilliantly, especially the corkscrew in the garbage disposal scene, the opening sequence and the rest stop scene.  A high quality is how the movie somewhat lacks frequent gore like the other sequels in the series and focuses more on being just plain scary like the original.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and the ending is the perfect way to end the series.  Another sequel would be just stupid, no matter how they figure out how to get by the events at the end of H20.

421,emmanuelgzz-90926,"For many, including myself, the last Halloween movie. Perfectly closes the saga.",8,14 December 2018,"When Scream came out in 1996 and took the world by surprise, many producers, movie directors and screenwriters were rushed to capitalize with the formula of this little gem released by the time horror movie was pretty much dead. Bride of Chucky, Urban Legend, I Know What You Did Last Summer are just a few examples of movies with a plot involving a serial killer slashing its victims with a sharp object. Halloween H20 is also on this list, a movie that was ""almost"" written by Kevin Williamson (thank God Kevin's treatment wasn't used entirely, it was awful... but many of his ideas were used for H20) in the late 90's, and this one is special among the other copycat thrillers because this one is the sequel of Halloween, the movie that inspired Williamson when he wrote Scream. So starting from here... there's something special with this film.
This film was almost directed by John Carpenter, which I'm glad he didn't, because Steve Miner made a wonderful job and Carpenter, knowing how bitter and out of touch he was after the 80's Halloween H20 would have been a disaster in his hands.
I don't care if the soundtrack wasn't memorable or if they shamesly used Marco Beltrami's cues, the main theme of H20 is beautiful and the best version of the monotonous and repetitive tune created by Mr. Bitter.
Acting? it was excellent. Jamie Lee Curtis did not go any further with the troubled Laurie Strode and her issues were addressed perfectly fine, without annoying us with the drama that Halloween 2018 tried to shove down our throats... Janet Leigh was OK, but the scene she shared with her daughter means the life to me I consider the scene as memorable as it was the controversial for its time shower scene she made for a little b&w movie in 1960.
Death scenes are brutal and Steve Miner did a wonderful job in the special effects department. Sarah's dead might be regarded as the best killing scene of the whole franchise.
Now..... the ending... common... it was the best thing this movie had. The decapitation scene, the music, Laurie's breath... it was so good one can say ""but what if she didn't kill Michael and she killed a paramedic with a larynge so destroyed he can't even say a word and with Michael's mask glued to his head while the real Michael is on the loose..."" because we wanted to see more... but no, fortunately none of that happened, and we have the last Halloween movie.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
422,JDash10,H20 Review,9,18 August 2006,"Well, after Halloween II's fiery finale, the series ended. There were some nonsense sequels, but that was the true end to Michael Myers. But you could always say, 'I wanna see more.' Halloween H20 has Michael Myers (Chris Durand) stalking Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) once more, with no stories of Jamie Lloyd, Thorn or Michael Myers falling into a coma. It's all about Michael vs. Laurie.The plot is simple, but doesn't have the baggage of previous instalments. 20 years after the Myers Massacre in Haddonfield, Illinois, Michael shows up, and the opening sequence delivers a clear message: 'The Monster Is Back.' Michael goes to Langdon, Illinois in an old banger, and tracks down the late Dr. Sam Loomis' friend, Marion Chambers. He picks off two teens and the nurse herself, and finds a red folder named 'Laurie Strode'. He takes it and leaves. 3 bodies and it's not even Halloween yet...Enter (or re-enter) Laurie Strode. She's a headmistress of a prep school in Southern California with a 17-year old son (Josh Hartnett), a new name of Keri Tate and an addiction to alcohol. She's kicking things off with Will Brennan (Adam Arkin), a teacher at the school. Laurie's son John, his girlfriend Molly, and their friends Charlie and Sarah hatch a plan to avoid the Halloween camping trip and celebrate the night at the school. But, Michael Myers has found out all about it, and he's bringing his version of celebrating to the school... murder.So, Charlie and Sarah die by Myers' hand, and I actually winced on first viewing. Sarah's slow death, and seeing dead Charlie was painful to watch on first view for me. It was a bit like Drew Barrymore's death on Scream, in that slow and painful death sense.Molly and John latch onto the fact that something is wrong, and are soon outrunning Michael. Laurie opens up to Will, who studied psychology, and can't believe it at first. Then, it dawns on Laurie. Her sister Judith was killed by Myers when she was 17. Laurie was attacked when she was 17. John is 17. It's Halloween night. And his camping equipment hasn't been packed. Laurie goes out to find John and Molly, losing Will along the way. Laurie tells Molly and John to drive off, so they do. Leaving Laurie to confront her demons. Laurie. The following scene, which I call 'The Table Chase' is scary and tense.Laurie stabs Michael loadsa times and he falls of of a balcony, landing on a table in the main hall. The cops and medics arrive with John and Molly, and Laurie is bandaged up, and Michael is packed into a black body bag. Laurie has to make sure that he is dead, so she grabs a fire axe and drives away in the coroner van. Michael rips out of the bag and falls out of the van, landing on the road. Laurie runs into him, leaving him staring at her as he lies on the windscreen. She drives off of the road-edge, sending then both plummeting into the forest below. Michael is pinned to a branch by the van, and Laurie slides out of the van, bruised and bloodied. She grabs the fire axe, walks up to Michael and holds his hand. His eyes stare at her, and she pulls back the axe and --SWIPE!-- Michael's head rolls onto the floor as the Halloween theme plays.The great thing about this film was, it was a film for the fans. It wasn't to tie up the loose ends of the prequel, or to cash in, it was to celebrate 20 years of Halloween. That, my friend, is why I loved it. It was just pure entertainment and fright (something the slasher series has been lacking for a while) 9/10 all the way.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

She is a heavy pill popper and drinker.  Her son John who is now 17 is tired of his mother and him and 3 other classmates stay at school while everyone else goes on a trip.

Jamie Lee Curtis does a great job of reviving her role of Laurie Strode; she'll always be the scream queen.  Unlike most horror movies there are no cheesy characters who get knocked off one by one in  ridiculous manners.  H2O's characters are fun and likeable, and we get to know them.  It really is a rare treat.The first hour of the movie is spent giving us the background, establishing characters, and setting a mood.  The last twenty minutes is pure excitement.  As the big show down begins, and we are not disappointed. And I must say that Halloween H2O has the best ending to a horror movie...bar none.This is the best horror movie since the original Scream, and it blows away the other Halloween sequels; even though it is  the best series.  It's short, sweet, and exciting just the way a good horror movie should be,  So if by some strange reason you still haven't seen this movie get out there and do it!!

Part 1 is scary because it takes place in a setting that is familiar to many Americans, a small and quiet neighborhood.

430,PAUL-344,Change of pace for the series....,8,7 July 2001,"With the success of ""the new"" horror film genre started by Kevin Williamson's Scream, it was inevitable that it would Halloween H20. With Williamson in an unacknowledged, co-producer role, H20 added a bit of hip teen class to the Halloween series, with Dawson Creek's Michelle Williams, Jodi Lynn O'Keefe, and the debut of Josh Hartnett heading the cast along with scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis. Fans of the series have been let down with disappointing sequels soiling the reputation of the classic original, so it wasn't all bad when the producers of H20 made a controversial decision to ignore films 3-6 in the series. Set in a California posh secluded high school as opposed to Haddonfield, H20 is a taught film lasting no more than 80 minutes if you don't include the credits. In the short running time the film manages to pack in suspense and drama to satisfy both fans of the series and of the genre, with the film managing to keep both traditional and ""new age"" horror fans happy. In all, a healthy addition to the classic horror series, watch out for Halloween 8: Homecoming.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
431,alternity2k,An excellent follow-up,10,5 October 2001,"Let me begin this review by stating that I completely disregard Halloween 3-6 as they have nothing to do with the storyline I have always loved. Also, I LIKE Kevin Williamson as a scriptwriter, and am a fan of his movies. If you disagree with either of my disclaimers, then stop reading now, because you won't like my review. That said, I love this movie as the rightful follow-up to parts 1 & 2. The action was almost non-stop, there were very few unlikeable characters, and the ending was excellent. The opening sequence with ""Mr Sandman"" playing rushes you right back to part 2, and the way the nurse and her teenage friends are dispatched is gruesome enough to put you on the edge of your seat. I especially like the ice skate through the head (too bad it's off camera, my only complaint for many of the murder scenes.)Then, Finding Laurie Strobe, an alcoholic, divorced headmistress at a prestigious prep school going by an assumed name and seeing her maniacal brother reflected in windows and mirrors after 20 years isn't far fetched at all. I'd be pretty screwed up too. Of course this drives her son crazy (one of my favorite lines from the movie is his reference to his drug induced dad, and the fact that he left her.) Of course this all comes to a head when the school conveniently clears out for a field trip leaving Laurie and a few stragglers, including her son, his girlfriend, an annoying couple and an even more annoying teacher/boyfriend on campus. Oh, and LL too, who has a disappointingly small role in the film as a romance writing security guard. Then comes michael, who doesn't run by any account, but moves more freely than in the other movies. After bypassing the guard, without actually confronting him (?) and a couple of cool murders and an exciting chase scene in which the son (played, by the way, by Josh Hartnett) actually fights Michael briefly and gets a stab wound for the trouble, Laurie and Michael finally come face to face, and then the movie takes off. Laurie's stand is incredible, if a little short, and the ending is nothing less than a sequel stopper, though with part 8 on the horizon, it didn't. If you liked the first 2 Halloween movies, and always wanted to see a true sequel and a real sense of finality come to the series, then this movie is for you.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
432,dylaneb,Halloween H20 Allows Michael To Come Out His Shell,9,23 July 2007,"I thought that Halloween H20 was certainly one of the best Halloween films out of the whole lot. The reason everyone watches these movies are because of the character Michael Myers. And in the first film, while it remains a horror classic to this day, Michael really didn't go on the killing spree audiences now crave to see. But in this film, Michael Myers is in the movie for a much longer time giving the audience more of a chance to really see this character on his own hunting ground. Plus, the death scenes are great! I love that this film not only brings out the best of Michael Myers but it also is great at building up the suspense. If you want a gory slasher like Saw or Hostel, then this is not the movie for you. This is a great Halloween film tying in a lot of aspects from the original classic and amplifying the horror to meet the expectations of a modern audience.

Just a few thoughts/ideas that could have made this one better.  The original score is truly a classic and would have added to the suspense.  I'm sure they thought the teaser parts they played were enough, but the new score couldn't even begin to compare.  The main difference was Michael. He was smaller, moved faster, and we didn't hear the ""mask-breathing"" or see anything from his point of view. What were they thinking?  You have Jamie Lee (kudos to her for paying homage to her roots), Adam Arkin, Josh Hartnet, LL Cool J, and Michelle Williams. Add a little more suspense, please!",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

Anyone who has seen Halloween 4-6 cannot watch this movie and feel satisfied with the lack of explanation or development of Jamie Lee's daughter in the series ""Jamie."" This movie essentially says that Halloween 3-6 didn't happen, which makes watching the movies pointless. I loved the tie in of the Myers cult in 6, it explained so much, it gave a background to the killing machine, H20 is good, but it lacks the history of Myers character.

Like the original 2 films, it chooses suspense over blood and gore (the movie is almost free of it). It has so many memorable scenes (not to mention my favorite and possibly the most satisfying ending in horror). It also is full of noticeable cast members that were well known at the time. What really sets this apart from other slashers (especially most 80's) was that it focuses on character progression and builds the story around that, rather than around the kills. Thats what ultimately gives this film more credibility as a legit piece of art than other films in the genre.

H20 is unlike the other movies in the Halloween series. There is little gore although it is somewhat extreme. Only about 5, no more than 10 people actually get the knife; and the action moves fast. The movies spends a little to much time establishing the plot and how Laurie is dealing with her life now; I came to see a horror movie, I want action, suspense and gore, not plot development of characters I could really care about. Lee gives a decent performance however her supporting cast is a let down except for the cameo by LL Cool J, not to shabby.

Halloween 3:Season of the witch had nothing to do with the homicidal maniac - it was a bit of a cheat really. This film sees the return of Jamie Lee Curtis who starred in the first two Halloweens. She unlike Donald Pleasance was sensible enough to leave after the first sequel, which matched with the original is laughably terrible! After that the sequels just got worse and worse. It is unfortunate about the late Donald Pleasance as Halloween H20 could have done with him to make it even better! Halloween is scarier and has a darker theme, but H20 is much faster paced - not in terms of action, but sharper. It does share a lot of the fine qualities as the first - such as the in jokes for movie buffs, quick wit and facetiousness.

448,chungb,"H20 is a scary, respectable Halloween sequel.",10,31 March 2000,"Out of all the Halloween sequels I've seen (all except 4 and 5), I have to say that the original is my favorite.  It is the most frightening and interesting in all the series.  I wasn't particularly impressed with any of the others until H20 came along.True, H20 does not have any new material, but even with its overused plot elements, it's still a tense, ominous movie.  I held my breath several times during the film and jumped almost as much.  Although it is a rather short film (86 minutes), H20 is never boring during that time.After twenty years, Keri Tate (original Halloween survivor) has moved to Northern California, has a son named John, a boyfriend named Will and is the headmistress of a prestigious private school.  Every Halloween, Laurie becomes paranoid and overprotective of John, much to his annoyance.  On Halloween, John and his friends decide to pass up a camping trip to have an illicit party on school grounds while Keri and Will decide to spend the evening together.  Through the course of the evening infamous killer Michael Myers, shows up and starts dispatching some of John's friends.  It doesn't take long for Keri to realize that Michael has returned to carve up some new victims. She sends out the last survivors for help and prepares to do a one-on-one battle with the deadly shape.Not since the original has Michael Myers been so frightening.  His mask is similar to the original one and is kept in the shadows more often.  This makes him a mysterious, threatening figure.  When he is on screen, a sense of dread and anxiety permeates the atmosphere.  The mood throughout the film is somber and ominous, even in scenes of broad daylight.  The gore is kept to a minimal level, but just enough to keep flowing-red- fans happy.  I always felt that blood was overused in other sequels and took away from the sense of fear.Undoubtedly, the best thing about H20 is Jamie Lee Curtis.  She brings a real spirit and passion to the role of Keri Tate and steals almost every scene she is in.  As a teen, I feel offended  when others dismiss material like this as being ""teeny bopper.""  However, if you are one of those people, don't worry: the four teens in here are inconsequential and aren't the focus of the film.  The focus is on Jamie Lee and her struggle.I highly recommend this film to horror film fans, especially those of the Halloween films.  True, sequels 3-6 had to be dismissed, but in my humble opinion, I was tired of the Thorn plot anyway.  I heard somewhere that the actors of Halloween 6 wouldn't even return to the series because they were so angry about the final product.  I was saddened by H6 and wondered what the Halloween series have come to.  Where could the series have gone from there?  Although Donald Pleasence will be missed, Jamie Lee manages to hold the H20 together even without him.  I have not seen a good Halloween sequel in a long time and after viewing H20, I vote it second only to the original. Score: 9/10.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

Halloween is a near-perfect horror film: very suspenseful, stylish, subtle, and loaded with amazing, spooky atmosphere. None of the sequels even come remotely close to duplicating any of the qualities that make Halloween so amazing. H20, however, - while not similar in style to the original - is the only Halloween sequel to display any sophistication and wit. There are lots of knowing and witty allusions to the original and the film actually doesn't insult the audience's intelligence. I love the ending to the film; it is very gratifying to see Laurie finally confront and defeat her monster, both figuratively and literally. And the final image and sounds of the film demonstrate an intelligence nowhere to be found in any of the other Halloween sequels: just as the original ended with the ominous panting of a disembodied Michael, H20 ends with the victorious panting of Laurie as the credits roll.The other sequels are for the most part embarrassments.

This is the seventh addition to the series so most of the people watching are fans of the series. However, somebody thought it would be a good idea to ignore the events of H4-H6 (and some of H2) which is a huge insult to people who have been following this series for such a long time.The H4-H6 movies have had their share of criticism over the years (also a lot of love) but they at least attempted to try new and interesting things, which H20 surely does not. It just involves Michael showing up one day (on Halloween naturally) and going on to kill a bunch of people trying to get to his sister or his nephew. There's a throwaway scene that suggest that Michael may be after Laurie's son who just turned 17 but this is never developed as Michael just ends up going after Laurie anyway. The problem is that we never learn what Michael has been doing for the last 20 years or why Michael waited such a long time to strike again.What has always been a consistent strength among Halloween movies, even the bad sequels, was the characters. Halloween movies have always had great characters that we truly cherished. I'm talking Jamie Lloyd, Dr. Loomis, and even Tommy Doyle. In H20 we mostly get cardboard teenage characters that we could care less about. Laurie Strode's return is the main attraction but she just comes off as a whinny alcoholic.The biggest problem is that this movie is shot almost entirely at day or in a preppy private school and this does not create an appropriate atmosphere for a horror movie. There are also little to no scares and the ending is just silly.I only recommend this movie for hardcore Halloween fans.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

On a side note, I actually hope the next installments of this franchise are able to keep all the other films within canon (even the dreaded 'Resurrection', which I truly feel was the ultimate cash grab) simply because I believe every film in this series does deserve it's place in the timeline, regardless of each ones perceived quality regarding story and production value...I just feel there are many creative plausible explanations to somehow include each film into an all encompassing storyline; one possible example of this, is within the current 'Halloween Kills' trailers which include the abstract/easter egg reference to the previously completely unrelated 'Hallloween III'!

I could not believe that they producers, directors and anyone else involved could not come up with a better premise than what the final product was. It's ludicrous!! At least Halloween:H20 had Jamie Lee Curtis in it for more than 10 minutes. It seemed to me that Resurrection was looking for any salvage point and the only way to have done that was to have a cameo with JLC. While I do NOT feel that H20 was among the top half of these films, it certainly deserves a better rating than Resurrection! H20 delivered on a couple of spine tingling moments, i.e when Laurie (Keri) meets eye to eye with Michael.

And that her character story wasn't finished yet. It great how Jamie's character has a new life and she's the now a headmistress of a secluded private school. It was shocking to find that she had a son, which was never mentioned in any of the previous Halloween sequels. It's great how Steve Miner, the director for having all the homages from other movies in that film. Like with Janet Leigh driving a car that resembles the Psycho car. And the music from Scream being noticeable in certain scenes. Moustapha Akkad could of gave John Carpenter the $10 million to direct the film but that didn't go so well. It would be great if they make a special edition Blu-ray of Halloween H20 including the deleted scenes also the interviews from the cast and the crew. It's great how this Halloween resembles the original. The way how the movie went was so classic and great for 90's horror flick. This was a necessary Halloween entry, after Halloween 6 cliffhanger in both versions. Now, Jamie's character is an alcoholic who is living with the guilt from the past. It's hard for to to be a teacher and headmistress while having stress that your brother murder a bunch of people. And her son tries to help her cope everyday with her past. I wish some of the of the death scenes were included.Many people don't like this Halloween and need to realize this film was suppose to reinvent the series. And let people know that Laurie didn't die in know car accident. This was mentioned in Halloween 4, that Laurie and her husband also Little John had died in the accident.

Once Michael inevitably shows up, she fights him, and fights him agressively.

What did she do....just abandon her daughter....and then hook up with some other guy and have another child and just forget she even had a daughter? And did Jamie's father fake his death too? Or has he done the same and just abandoned the kid and gone somewhere else to start over?Considering how protective Laurie is over John, you wouldn't think she could just abandon her other child....... And then they make even more sequels that what?.... have nothing to do with Halloween 4+? I am very confused......someone please explain exactly what they did with this film series. Because I just don't get it.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later

465,poisonivy12321,good movie but halloween 2 is better,7,3 October 2021,"Halloween H20 was fun but it's not the best sequel, halloween 2 is the best sequel and was alot creepier then H20. And for the person that said H2 1981 was one of the worst and the person that said this was better then H2 what are you two smoking? Halloween 2 is one of the best in the series way better then H20. That aside i saw H20 when i was 10 and i did enjoy it, but it's not the best.",Halloween H20 - 20 Years Later
