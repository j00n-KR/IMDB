0,MartinHafer,"Well acted, but I really wasn't sure what the point of all this was....",7,13 January 2013,"Huge Spoilers Ahead--STOP READING UNLESS YOU DON'T MIND SEEING A HUGE SPOILER!!! I WARNED YOU!!! ""Awakenings"" is a pretty good movie and I do recommend you see it. I just think that the film is a tad overrated. Most of my feelings about this are because, ultimately, all the miraculously revived patients fell right back asleep! I know this is a big spoiler--but it might make it so many won't even want to bother with the film. However, on the plus side, at least they didn't give the film a phony happy ending--since it is based on a true story.Robin Williams is very nice in a non-comedic role. He plays a doctor who has a unit of supposedly hopeless cases. These folks have a weird disease (encephilitis) that makes them zombie-like. However, instead of giving up on these poor folks, he decided to try again and again to revive them. He is successful, to a point.Much of the pleasure in watching the film is seeing the folks reconnect with the world as well as the fine acting. But, as I said above, a short time later, they all fell back into their stupor--where they remained until death. This makes for a MEGA-depressing movie--something odd, since the film is billed as quite the opposite. Worth seeing but a real downer.",Awakenings
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Profoundly moving, intelligent and brilliantly performed",10,2 August 2010,"Awakenings is a wonderful film for so many reasons. It is profoundly moving, intelligent and brilliantly performed, with a lot to recommend. It is exquisitely filmed, with wonderful cinematography and scenery, and the music is beautiful.The direction is rock-solid, the story is moving and compassionate and the screenplay is very intelligent and thought-provoking. Then there are the performances, both Robin Williams and Robert DeNiro give outstanding performances, and John Heard and Julie Kavner are equally impressive.Overall, if you like this sort of film, by all means see Awakenings, because I think you will like it. Equally if you love good acting and movies that make you think, Awakenings is also ideal. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Awakenings
2,SnoopyStyle,Robin Williams' most complete performance,8,30 September 2013,"Awkward Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) has more difficulties dealing with people than with worms. He is a new hire to the understaffed psych ward. One day he noticed a previously assumed catatonic patient actually has reactions. Soon he finds other such patients including Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro), and a drug that could possibly save them.Penny Marshall created a film that plucks the heartstrings. It is a well crafted emotional tour de force. Robin Williams is able to restraint his manic energy to make Dr Sayer is a compelling man who learns to grow. Robert De Niro is playing the showier part, and he excels at it. The movie will leave you with a tear and a hope in your heart.",Awakenings
3,Prismark10,Awakenings,6,23 September 2020,"Based on Oliver Sacks's 1973 book. Dr Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) is a shy but dedicated doctor who gets a job in a hospital in Bronx in 1969.Dr Sayer treats several patients in a catatonic state after the encephalitis epidemic of 1917-28 with a new experimental drug.One of the patients revived is Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro) who has to adjust to his new life in 1969. However the drug is not a complete cure and Lowe begins to relapse.Awakenings directed by Penny Marshall received a lot of plaudits when it was released. There was acclaimed for the acting by Robin Williams and especially Robert De Niro who got to do a whole lot of tics.Watching it again, I noticed similarities with another movie De Niro would make a few years later. Frankenstein, a monster that is reanimated but he is not treated as an ordinary human which makes him irate. He cannot remain human for long which makes the monster angry.Awakening comes across as very sentimentalised, you can sense this was a movie that was meant to be life affirming with a downbeat ending.Even though it was based on a true story, I think it was heavily fictionalised. I saw Dr Oliver Sacks being interviewed in the early 1990s, he had a cockney accent as he was born in Britain.When Sacks died I learned that although he suffered from severe shyness, had been celibate for many years. In his younger days, Sacks had been a hairy gay biker. It makes the love interest in the film look rather hollow.",Awakenings
4,kosmasp,Looking inside ...,9,21 February 2018,"This is based on true life event and has great actors in the lead. I don't know how it is I had not seen it before, but while I was looking for something else on Netflix I stumbled across this. Some people may think De Niro lost his touch once he got into comedy, but you cannot for one second doubt or critisize him in the Dramas he played in.This one in particular, was not easy to play. And I can only imagine a method actor like him, what he must have gone through. Well what he made himself endure. While there always are things that are going to be altered from reality for dramatic purposes, what happened in 1969, what the doctors and patients went through is tough to put into words. It is something that is touching, sad and uplifting at various points of the movie. At the end, you get a bit of extra information on the real people. But even without that added text, the movie was clear. The power of the mind is big ... and the power of movies tries to match it here ...",Awakenings
5,classicsoncall,"""...the human spirit is more powerful than any drug...""",8,4 June 2018,"Robert De Niro and Robin Williams both play against type in this engaging story of a doctor who makes a connection between childhood encephalitis and a disease that leaves it's patients in a virtual catatonic state well into adulthood. One of the more extreme cases is that of Leonard Lowe (De Niro), who has been non-responsive for over thirty years. Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Williams) initially seems out of his element in a position that requires a deft touch with human beings, as his previous work in research was more suited to his introverted personality. But his perseverance in learning about his patients and their medical histories prepares him to do some head-butting with the administrative staff of Bainbridge Hospital in order to provide funding for a drug he believes will help.At this point in his career, Robin Williams was skillfully taking on more dramatic roles compared to the inspired lunacy that pervaded his earlier work. In a different time and place, he might have portrayed the role of Leonard, with De Niro assuming the role of the doctor. The eclectic casting makes for a surprisingly effective and heartwarming drama, though the feeling becomes muted as the story progresses, with Leonard regressing back into a pattern of tics and spasms that takes it's toll on his self worth. Apparently the effect of the drug seemed to lose it's effectiveness over time, as other patients exposed to the treatment began questioning their own likelihood for relapse.Based on a true story, and realizing the need for a compact narrative, it did seem too coincidental that many of the patients similar to Leonard all responded miraculously to the drug treatment and began functioning more normally again almost instantly. The film's afterword mentioned that the success rate of the real doctor who developed the curative drug never again achieved that of the time frame depicted in the story during the summer of 1969. But for a brief moment in time, the picture evokes the power of the human spirit to overcome the intricate frailties of the human body.",Awakenings
6,gavin6942,Oliver Sacks... Fictionalized,8,17 November 2012,"The victims of an encephalitis epidemic many years ago have been catatonic ever since, but now a new drug offers the prospect of reviving them.Dustin Hoffman as an autistic man in ""Rain Man""? You have nothing on Robert DeNiro as a post-encephalitic Parkinson's patient in this film! The tics, the walk, the antics... obviously I was not there when this actually happened, but I was impressed. Robin Williams did alright, too, playing it straight in one of his many turns as a doctor on film.I love Oliver Sacks and his writing, and I am glad they were able to make such a great adaptation that was both educational and entertaining (like his books are). Was the transformation so sudden and dramatic in real life? I have my doubts. But you have to cut corners to fit within two hours, so if this was one way, it is forgivable.Ebert gives this four of four stars. I think he was spot on with this one, and his longer-than-average review (stuffed with praise) is excellent.",Awakenings
7,lee_eisenberg,"wake up, everyone",8,10 April 2006,"""Awakenings"" was one of several movies in which Robin Williams play a man with his own ideas about how to do things, which may or may not unnerve his superiors (others include ""Good Morning, Vietnam"", ""Dead Poets Society"" and ""Patch Adams""). In this case, he plays Dr. Malcolm Sayer, looking at catatonic patients in 1969 New York. While catatonic, these patients can catch a ball if you throw it at them. This leads him to look into how he can cure them.This shows that when he tries, Williams certainly can do very well in drama. Equally good is Robert DeNiro, as Dr. Sayer's patient Leonard Lowe. Showing an unusual ability to play a non-mobster role, DeNiro really does make you feel for Leonard.Overall, it's a very well done movie. Given that Penny Marshall started out as either LaVerne or Shirley (I've never seen that show, so I don't know which), we might think that she'd never be able to direct a serious movie, but she certainly can. A great movie. Also starring Julie Kavner, Ruth Nelson, John Heard, Penelope Ann Miller, Alice Drummond, Max von Sydow, and even a very young Vin Diesel.",Awakenings
8,jboothmillard,Awakenings,8,25 March 2008,"From director Penny Marshall (Big) this is a really powerful drama about the treatment of an intriguing subject, based on a true story. Basically shy Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams, in one of his first really serious, non-comedic roles) has started work at a ward filled with all kinds of incurable patients with mental disabilities. But he is fascinated by the comatose and catatonic patients, basically staying completely still and never speaking, but will have a reflex action to catch a thrown ball. He investigates further, and might have found an experimental chemical as a cure, and decides to give it first to Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro), who you saw a quick flashback of at the beginning of the film. In orange juice it is ruined by the acids, but in milk and with high amount this experiment, allowed by Leonard's mother (Ruth Nelson) of course, is successful! Leonard is moving about and talking on his own after being in a coma since his teens, he has been ""awakened"". Soon enough, the other comatose patients are given the same treatment, and they too are revived. To see all these poor people brought pretty much ""back to life"" is very touching and delighting. I was hoping it not to, but Leonard gets higher amounts, and the chemical may have created a reaction, or is failing because he is having angry moments, and his movement is suggesting going back to his coma status. In the end, Leonard and all the other comatose patients go back to what they were before, and to this day, Dr. Sayer and others are still trying to find the right cure, but will possibly never come as close as he did in 1969. Also starring The Simpsons' Julie Kavner as Eleanor Costello, Home Alone's John Heard as Dr. Kaufman, Penelope Ann Miller as Paula, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective's Alice Drummond as Lucy, Judith Malina as Rose, Barton Heyman as Bert, George Martin as Frank, Anne Meara as Miriam, Dexter Gordon as Rolando and a brief Max Von Sydow as Dr. Peter Ingham. A very believable drama that has similarities to Cuckoo's Nest and (with Williams in it) Patch Adams, both De Niro and Williams excel in their roles. Robin Williams was number 19, and Robert De Niro number 2 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, De Niro was also number 50 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 5 (along with Al Pacino) on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!",Awakenings
9,ccthemovieman-1,What An Incredible Story!!,10,20 March 2006,"Here's a good example of how you can still make a great modern-day movie without profanity, violence or sex.This is an amazing story, based on fact, about about a doctor who makes great progress fighting an illness that heretofore was considered incurable. These were patients in catatonic states, and the good doctor uses an experimental drug to snap these people back to reality and to a normal life as they once had. The patients, and how they react, both before and after the medications, is really fascinating.Robert De Niro is outstanding as one of the patients, but that's not a surprise knowing all the fine acting performances he's done over the years. Robin Williams, relatively new to dramatic acting when this came out, was also excellent in a very low-key role. Penelope Ann Miller is extremely sweet and appealing. I wish both she and Williams would do more roles like that.With multiple viewings, I came to appreciate the minor characters in here a lot more, such as De Niro's mother, played by Ruth Nelson, whom I fondly remember in the 1945 film ""A Tree Grows In Brooklyn."" What a treat is was to see her again and this was just two years before she died. Also, Alice Drummund as the patient known as ""Lucy"" was notable.Language-wise, i's almost stunning to watch a movie which has De Niro, Williams, Miller and John Heard and not hear one profane word uttered! (The film isn't perfect, however, as some idiot decided to insert one f-word, and in a totally unnecessary circumstance.)This is a memorable story and one I guarantee you won't forget because the subject matter is so different.",Awakenings
10,moonspinner55,Sentimental actors' piece...well-made (with one eye on the box-office) but nothing more,6,24 June 2010,"In 1969, a shy, modest neurologist (Robin Williams, hiding his usual tics behind a beard) working on the east coast tries out a new medicine (in real-life, levodopa, sometimes called L-dopa) on a ward full of patients suffering from various degrees of catatonia; the results are successful, at least initially. Screenwriter Steven Zaillian, adapting Oliver Sacks' non-fiction book from 1973, probably didn't intend his narrative to get gummed up with feel-good montages and romantic encounters, but the material is very 'Hollywood'. Robert De Niro received an Oscar nomination as a patient who discovers the world (and girls!), but there's no room for spontaneity in the performances because Penny Marshall has directed the whole thing as an exercise in sentiment; it's meant to get us in the throat and in the chest, and those who make a connection are responding to the smoothly-designed mechanization of an old movie formula (which isn't even updated for the benefit of those who have seen all this before). The doctor is a self-effacing saint who is first applauded and then brought down to size once the effects of the medicine wear off, while his patients are lovable, impaired angels who are able to break out of their cocoons just long enough to show us their beaming personalities. There are few dimensions in Marshall's execution--she wants an emotional home-run and aims for the rafters. It's a wet valentine which has already been cried over. **1/2 from ****",Awakenings
11,sunwarrior13,Great Acting By Williams And De Niro,10,9 March 2014,"Awakenings is a film that tells the true story of British neurologist Oliver Sacks, fictionalized as American Malcolm Sayer and portrayed by Robin Williams who discovers beneficial effects of a new drug. He administered it to catatonic patients like Leonard Lowe,portrayed here by Robert De Niro, and the rest of the patients were awakened after decades of catatonia.They have to deal with a new life in a new time. It also stars Penelope Ann Miller,John Heard and Max Von Sydow. It was directed by Penny Marshall.Dr. Sayer takes a job at a Bronx psychiatric hospital in 1969. Here he's put in charge of several seemingly catatonic patients who, under Sayer's painstaking guidance, begin responding to certain stimulant. Apprised of the efficacy of a new drug called L-DOPA in treating degenerative- disease victims, Sayer is given permission to test the drug on one of his patients. Leonard Lowe, who has not communicated with anyone since lapsing into catatonia as a child. Gradually, Lowe comes out of his shell, encouraging Sayers to administer it to the other patients under his care. Robin Williams and Robert De Niro give tour de force performances in this touching and moving medical drama.Williams definitely excel in his non-comedic role while De Niro was truly believable as a catatonic patient.While the story maybe somewhat good but not great as it contains too many subplots like the doctor's own problems and his romantic affair instead of focusing on the doctor-patient relationship and the effect of the drug especially during their awakening,the performances of both actors alone is worth the price of admission.Aside from that,it also provides us awareness about catatonic patients and what they go through.",Awakenings
12,hitchcockthelegend,You'd think at a certain point all these atypical somethings would amount to a typical something.,8,6 June 2009,"The late 60s and post encephalitis patients are roused by various doses of the drug L-Dopa. But as the patients try to come to terms with the new and alien life they are brought into, side effects starts to rear its head.I guess it depends on your emotional state how you absorb Awakenings as a motion picture. There are those that simply believe it's an exercise in currying sentimental favour, whilst others, such as myself, believe stories such as this need to be told. Based on the novel by Oliver Sacks {Malcom Sayer played by Robin Williams} the only real cause for grumble from myself is that sadly, the film fails to fully form the shock and terror these newly roused patients must have felt. The encephalitis epidemic occurred between 1917-1928, these people got old without knowing it. It's briefly touched on with a couple of tender moments, notably thru Alice Drummond's Lucy, but the main focus of the film, perhaps not surprisingly, is the relationship between Williams' Sayer and Robert DeNiro's Leonard Lowe.DeNiro is on full Oscar baiting tilt here {nominated but lost out to Jeremy Irons for Reversal of Fortune} and it's a magnetic performance, tender and close to heart breaking at times. His interplay with Williams {suitably restrained} is what drives the film on, but as stated prior, at the expense of a fully formed whole. Still, director Penny Marshall and her team have gone the whole hog for the sentimental aspect, is it too forced? yes at times it is, but you would have to have been quarried from granite not to be affected by some scenes, re: a mother son reunion for example. So it's not quite the classic it not only threatened to be, but really should have been. But the central theme of learn and evolve is something that hopefully even the films detractors have taken on board.Sweet and touching. 8/10",Awakenings
13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Beautiful,8,6 August 2007,"I hadn't really seen any other movies by Penny Marshall before watching this. The only one I'm sure I've seen is Riding in Cars with Boys, and, well, if you've read my review of that one, you'll know I didn't think very much of it. Looking at her filmography, I think this is the best of the films she's directed, quality-wise. The plot is great, and very well-told. The pacing is pretty much spot-on. The acting is all top-notch. De Niro is astounding. My fiancée remarks that it made her forget the stereotypical ""De Niro roles"", Cape Fear's Max Cady and the various(and more often than not, interchangeable) gangster roles that he's played. Personally, I'd also say that Anthony J. Nici was a good choice for the young Leonard Lowe. I think he looks remarkably like him(right down to the mole... added or not), and he does fine acting, as well. Williams shows that he can make us feel, as well as make us laugh, once again. The music is really good, songs are well-chosen. The editing is very good throughout. Most of the camera-work is, as well, although the zoom-ins don't work in the least. Very engaging and sad film. I recommend this to any fan of drama and/or the actors involved. 8/10",Awakenings
14,view_and_review,Sensational,9,9 March 2020,"Finally, a movie about patients in a hospital for mental or psychological disorders that doesn't involve doctors and nurses just doping them up. Yes, drugs, or at least a drug, is a central component to the theme of the movie, but in this case the drug isn't simply to make the patients more manageable.Leonard (Robert De Niro) has been in a near vegetative state for the past 20 or 30 years of his life due to encephalitis. Encephalitis is a swelling of the brain after infection, it can cause paralysis and loss of speech. Leonard experienced both.It was strange yet reassuring to see De Niro in such a vulnerable role. He normally plays the strong alpha male character, so to see him as an invalid was new and refreshing.Leonard's life was forever changed by Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams). Dr. Sayer had a hunch that the drug L-Dopa could help patients who'd suffered from encephalitis. He was right. But Dr. Sayer's best quality wasn't his ability to think outside the box to help paralyzed patients, his best quality was his heart. He cared about each and every patient and he ardently wanted to make a difference in their lives.""Awakenings"" was a strong directorial performance from Penny Marshall. Truly, there are enough praises to go around in this production it was done so well. ""Awakenings"" is a sensational movie.",Awakenings
15,neil-476,Supremely moving,9,6 April 2011,"I never cared for Robert De Niro very much. After watching Awakenings, I realised that this was actually the greatest of compliments to his acting, for what I really didn't like were the characters he played.In Awakenings, De Niro plays Leonard Lowe, a middle-aged patient who has been catatonic since contracting an illness in childhood. Doctor Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) tries the experimental drug L-Dopa on him, and he wakes from his catatonia to discover that over 40 years have passed. However, the effects of the drug turn out to be temporary, and Leonard - and the other patients similarly awakened - slip back into catatonia.This story - at first sight, perhaps a riff on Flowers For Algernon - is a fictionalised version of a true story, which makes it all the more heartbreaking: these people, to the extent that they are still living, remain in the same catatonic condition. Should be we be pleased or distraught that they were wakened to enjoy this brief window of life.De Niro (and Williams) are both phenomenal, playing parts which are completely contrary to the sorts of part they had played up until that point in their careers. In both cases, this was something out of the blue and, in both cases, it woke me up to what remarkable talents these two men are (which is not to ignore Julie Kavner - Marge Simpson pulls one out of the bag, too).This film is uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time, and is thoroughly recommended.",Awakenings

It's reminiscent of the short story ""Flowers for Algernon"" (which by the way was made into the movie ""Charly,"" for which Cliff Robertson won an Oscar -- am I seeing a theme here?)

17,AlsExGal,"""I know it's not 1926, I just need it to be""...",10,2 March 2013,"... is just one of the many quotable quotes in this film that will stick with you. This one is one of my personal favorites and just about as perfect as modern (post 1970) movie making gets. The messages and comparisons of the film are rather obvious, but the individual scenes, the characters, and the acting are superlative. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) is a complex individual - he's a physician - a healer of men - who is scared to death of all mankind. In fact he seems to be scared of all living things including a friendly neighborhood dog. He's gotten away with pure research positions up to the present, but now, in 1969 and in need of a job, he takes a job as a physician in a chronic care hospital. Now here's the complexity - You'd think a man who is afraid of other people would just sit back and perform his rounds and be grateful to be around patients who are as physically catatonic as he is emotionally catatonic. However, his humanity and intellectual curiosity are stronger than his fear and desire to hide as he begins to notice ""patterns"" in both the behavior and in the records of some of his patients that makes him believe that they may still be ""alive inside"". This leads to research that pinpoints one illness that all of the patients had in common - encephalitis lethargica that spread worldwide from 1917 to 1928. After the illness subsided, sometimes years later, would the catatonia gradually set in. Dr. Sayer manages - with great difficulty - to get funding to try a new drug on these particular patients, and they awaken, some after 40 years, many in their 60's physically, but in their 20's emotionally. The focus of the movie, though, is on the friendship that forms between Leonard Lowe (Robert DeNiro), a 50 year old victim of the disease, and Dr.Sayer. Leonard's mother (Ruth Nelson as Mrs. Lowe) is one of the few people visiting on a regular basis after all of these years - Leonard has been here for 30 years, ill since age 11, catatonic since age 20. So the focus is on Leonard's love of life once awakened versus Dr. Sayer's fear of it - this is the obvious part of the film. However that doesn't take anything away from De Niro doing a great job of playing someone who isn't a tough guy for a change and from Robin Williams from playing one of his most dramatic roles, both characters extremely vulnerable in their own way. Julie Kavner is pitch perfect as Dr. Sayer's loyal ,hard working, and assertive nurse and assistant. Ruth Nelson gives a performance of a lifetime, just two years before her death, as a mother who has dedicated her life to a son she remembers as and has cared for as a child for almost 40 years but is a bit perplexed when he awakens as a man and his fancy turns towards love. For once she has a rival for her son's attention, which is not unusual. What is unusual is that she has to deal with this 30 years later than most mothers. There are heartbreaking scenes, there are funny scenes, and one scene in particular that brings to light how people sometimes will dismiss something as possible because it just seems too horrible. My favorite scene in this latter category: Dr. Sayer, when doing his research on the catatonic patients, visits the eminent physician Dr. Peter Ingham (Max Von Sydow). Ingham was dealing with the catatonia when it first developed in the 20's and 30's. When Dr. Sayer asks Dr. Ingham how he knows that the virus has not spared the patients higher faculties he responds: ""Because the alternative is unspeakable."" Classic.",Awakenings

Being a hospital movie about ailing people trying to recover puts it in the same camp as ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975) and ""Instinct"" (1999), but it's not as compelling.There's just not enough human interest beyond the viewer being sympathetic toward the patients' plight and wanting them to get well. It's also marred by some blatant predictableness, like Leonard's name on the bench and the ""cup of coffee"" aspect. Still, this is a tale that needed to be told and I'm not sorry I watched it.

He's been in good movies though and Awakenings is definitely one of his best performances, but that's not only due to his acting but more because this is such a strong, beautiful and emotional story. Based on a true story, Awakenings shows the complexity of encephalitis, a condition that we still don't understand. Hats off for the actors playing the patients. Even if they do not have much lines to remember the visual acting was just on top.

21,sddavis63,Learning What's Important In Life,8,6 January 2003,"I first saw this movie several years ago (shortly after its release) and remember at the time not being particularly enthusiastic about it. The passage of time must have done something to my sensibilities because I've just had the opportunity to see it again and this time I was quite taken with the film.The movie is a true story based on the work of Dr. Malcolm Sayer, a New York neurologist who discovers a potential treatment for patients who have lived in a catatonic state due to encephalitis and succeeds in ""awakening"" several of them during the summer of 1969. The story is emotional and tugs at the heart as we deal with the joy of the patients at being awakened, but also at their grief in discovering the passage of time (some have been in this state for almost 40 years), their own aging and the deaths of those they loved. Finally, there is the fear they feel as the experimental drug begins to lose its effect on them and they face losing the lives they have just begun to rediscover.There are good performances in this movie. Robert Deniro was excellent as Leonard Lowe, the first patient treated and reawakened by Sayer, and around whom the movie revolves. Robin Williams put on an effective performance as Dr. Sayer, a shy man who would be happier in a lab than dealing with flesh and blood patients, who learns much from these special patients about the value of life and how to live it. There's also a strong supporting cast including the likes of John Heard (Dr. Kaufman) and Julie Kavner (Nurse Eleanor.) This certainly isn't an ""action pic,"" and if you're looking for edge of your seat excitement you should look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a movie with a strong emotional pull and a solid life lesson, ""Awakenings"" might well be the one.8/10",Awakenings
22,ElMaruecan82,An 'awakening' experience regarding the value of life ...,9,22 August 2012,"If Penny Marshall's ""Awakenings"" had one effect on me, it's certainly to make me think about life. Not as an existential notion, but as daily physical condition. We take for granted our capability to walk, to speak, to eat, to drink, to think by ourselves, to be able to control our movements, our choices and decisions, but have we ever questioned the significance of these little things? To a certain extent, the word 'awakening' doesn't only relate to Dr. Sayer's patients but also to the viewers.Robin Williams plays Dr. Sayer, a shy and amiable physician who's hired in a Bronx hospital to take care of catatonic patients although he's more used to handle animal living forms. Dr. Kaufman (John Heard), one of the executives can see that and is reluctant to hire him, but the patients need a doctor so he just knocked at the right door. But the first act only provides sorrowing sights of patients stuck in an immobile position, incapable of making the slightest gesture, let alone communicating. The ward is named 'the garden' in reference to their vegetative state; indeed, they live like plants do, and even animals have much richer lives. All the patients survived the 1917-1928 epidemic of encephalitis lethargy, a strange epidemic that quickly disappeared but plunged its survivors in a strange comatose state, despite a period of brief recovery.One of the film's most haunting images is the archive footage shot of a person extending her arm with a sort of crisped and desperate look in the face, the mouth wide open, the patient is like asking for something, help maybe? Is that human being even thinking, asks Dr. Sayer, disturbed as we probably are by those images. No, retorts the retired Dr. Ingham who treated them (played by Max Von Sydow). Why not? Because the alternative would be unthinkable! In other words, the very idea that these creatures would be capable of thoughts or sheer awareness but incapable to express them, like caged in their own body, would be properly intolerable. Maybe Ingham is right but then how about these little signs that Sayer starts to notice during his extensive study.The pivotal moment occurs when he treats a patient named Lucy (Alice Drummond) he notices that she caught her eyeglasses before they fell in the ground. Later, it appears that not only Lucy but also all the comatose patients are capable to catch a ball thrown at them. It's a reflex, suggests Kaufman, the reflex, according to Sayer, would be to bat the ball away. Sayer is convinced that there is still life inside the patients, that the sickness spared their faculties, only they don't have the will and can only borrow it, like the stone-face Lucy borrowed the 'will of the ball'. Sayer's colleagues concur that the theory is absurd, but it makes an impact on Nurse Costello (Julie Kavner) who encourages Sayer to go further in his investigation.Sayer focuses then on the case of Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro) a man in his fifties, comatose since his early teens. Mrs. Lowe (Ruth Nelson) takes care of him everyday, resigned that she's the mother of a man sentenced to be a perpetual baby. But she admits she can communicate with him, not with words of course, but a language Dr. Sayer would understand if he had children. Sayer sure agrees with her, especially on the fact that Leonard can communicate. He proceeds to a graphical record of the electrical activity in his brain, and the resulting graph shows one peak, occurred when Sayer said his name. The 'will of the ball' theory was a fiasco but this discovery is Sayer's first little victory. He knows he's on his way.And step-by-step, the researches of Dr Sayer will lead to a theory assimilating the symptoms of his patients to an extreme stage of Parkinson disease where the movements are so acute that they cancel each other out. With the permission of Mrs. Lowe, he experiments the L- Dopa, the medicine used for Parkinsonism, on Leonard, with various dosages. Tired of waiting, Sayers almost turns to a half-doctor and half sorcerer's apprentice, he tries the highest dose on Leonard and the results are immediate and spectacular, almost miraculous. Leonard awakens from his state and is like born again, he can hardly speak but it doesn't matter because the magnificent smile on his face says enough. The eyes still have the innocence of a child, a man whose adulthood was stolen, and the smile sweeps off Dr. Ingham's theory: Leonard knows and understands what he's recovering from.The film takes a magical and delightful turn into happiness and rediscovery while we follow, not only Leonard, but all the patients, awakening, learning to speak, to feel things again, to eat, to control their emotions, to live and to love. It's funny, inspiring, touching and carried by two wonderful performances by both Robert De Niro and Robin Williams. De Niro's eyes and smiles convey an exhilarating attachment to life that would confine to a heart-breaking desperateness when some secondary effects moderating the enthusiasm of the first results would appear; it's one of De Niro's very best performances. On the other hand Williams's timidity, in the polar opposite of all the characters he played, enriches the film with another dimension, a realization about the little things that make life worth living: such abstractions like friendship, respect or love.It's precisely in the name of friendship, respect and love that no sickness can dehumanize a person. That's the inspirational message and eye-opening vision of ""Awakenings"". The film was Oscar-nominated for Best Picture, Best Writing and Best Acting in a Leading Role (Robert De Niro), it's based on a true story, and it's hard to imagine that miracles like this could happen, but they do. In fact, the simple act of living is a miracle by itself that we should value every day.",Awakenings
23,g-bodyl,This Film Will Awaken the Minds of Movie Lovers!,9,6 May 2015,"Awakenings is what I would call an underrated film despite a big-name duo and a slew of Oscar nominations. This drama is a little-seen movie about people who are given a second chance to see the world. I like how the film does not sugarcoat the story. Sure, there are intense moments of happiness, but that doesn't last and wasn't meant to be. The film is well-written, well-acted, and one of the most underrated film of the past 2 decades. Penny Marshall's film is about a new doctor who is given a ward full of catatonic patients. He is not happy what he sees and is given permission to administer a chemical drug. When the first patient, Leonard, awakens for the first time as an adult, Dr. Sayer realizes there could be hope for these patients. I thought the film was well-acted. Robert De Niro does a great job as Leonard as he represents a catatonic patient quite well both physically and mentally. Also doing a great job was Robin Williams. I think this could have been the first true film proving that Robin was just not a comedian. Overall, Awakenings is a great character study and it's a better film than I have anticipated. Another film that people should definitely try and see. The film will warm your heart, but it is also a kind of film that will make you sad as well. But this is certainly a good film to watch and I highly recommend it.My Grade: A-",Awakenings

Loosely based on a real story, it tells a powerful one, very simple yet very moving story - miracle if you ask me.Performances are first rate here from the great Robert De Niro and very good one from Robin Williams. Directing is superb - at running time ~2 hours this movie never drags and is highly involving from start till finish. Script by the great Steven Zaillian is also superb, not overwritten, not to much sentimental. Overall, ""Awakenings"" is a movie which after seeing it once you will probably won't ever forget it.

25,slightlymad22,A Heartbreaking Tearjerker,8,16 January 2015,"After recently watching ""Mrs Doubtfire"" and ""Old Dogs"" a movie from the latter part of the late Robin Williams's career. I decided to revisit some of his earlier dramatic work. My first choice was 1988's ""Dead Poets Society"". Then I settled on this movie from 1990. Plot In A Paragraph: In 1969 Malcolm Sayer (A brilliant Robin Williams) discovered the effects of the drug L-Dopa. He administered it to catatonic patients who survived the 1917–28 epidemic of encephalitis lethargica. Leonard Lowe (A brilliant Robert De Niro) and the rest of the patients are awakened after decades of catatonia and have to deal with a new life in a new time. Robin Williams Robert De Niro and Penelope Ann Miller are all brilliant as is Julie Kavner, John Heard and Ritchard Libertini (Who I always enjoy watching on screen) are both good value too. In fact there is not a weak link in the cast. It also features Vin Diesel in his movie debut as a hospital orderly. I'm not quite sure why the Academy nominated De Niro for Best actor, and yet they snubbed Williams. Yet the Golden Globes nominated Williams for Best actor, Yet snubbed De Niro. As I think both actors superb. I'm not sure how good Jeremy Irons was in reversal of fortune, but I'm guessing he was excellent, because based on this movie, I think De Niro should have won the Oscar, and Williams should have won the Golden Globe. It would not be the first time the Academy and Golden Globes got it wrong. I also think that Penelope Ann Miller should have been nominated too.One of Robin Williams best, and one of Robert De Niro's best. Says it all. Everybody needs to watch this movie.",Awakenings
26,didi-5,good but ultimately depressing,8,21 March 2004,"Awakenings is the story of Dr Malcolm Sayer, played surprisingly well by Robin Williams, who discovers a way to wake up catatonic patients for whom there is thought to be no hope.One of the patients is Leonard Lowe (a great performance from Robert De Niro), and he, alongside the others who are 'awakened', celebrate the changes in their life and opportunities with great joy.  There are great scenes where the patients come to grips with their new status, and make the most of their time, however brief.The problem is that of course this medication-induced rebirth is transient, and that there are no happy endings here.  This makes the film a mix of celebratory love of life, and a deeply depressing conclusion.",Awakenings
27,Dr_Coulardeau,Quite a mind stirring film,10,28 July 2018,"This film is a true story and like with all true stories we get a fantasized version of the story itself. We are dealing here with post encephalitic patients who have become absolutely catatonic. A new drug, quite experimental and that has not been tested really on humans properly, is used in a psychiatric institution where they have a dozen or so patients in that situation. First one patient, and then the whole group. The result is spectacular. They wake up and they start having a normal life, well normal is a big word. They just try to adjust to the reality they finally see and within the limited freedom they can have within an institution out of which they cannot go without being totally supervised by professionals. The first patient who was provided with the drug, Leonard, becomes very autonomous to the point of establishing a relationship with a visiting young woman and then asking for the right to just go out on his own for a walk. The film uses the word ""miracle"" too much. There is no miracle with chemical stuff and drugs. There are only physiological reactions to the drugs. They can be positive. They can be negative. They can last for a long time with a regular treatment or use, or they can only last a short period of time, an awakening and nothing else and then the patients go back to the catatonic state they used to be in and they may have spent thirty years in. The film at the end is not hiding this fact, but the term ""miracle"" is false in this context.The film insists on the reactions of the patients, on the way they enter a phase where they want to have some kind of real living, or at least what they imagine they would enjoy. The film is totally ignorant of a simple fact. These catatonic people are catatonic for us but they still can hear, they still can see, they still can enjoy the benefits of their senses and they know the standard language that is spoken around them. The film does not concentrate on this fact we know today, we would concentrate on today: the patients have heard a lot and seen a lot, even if they are locked up in an institution. But they have received a lot of oral language spoken around them and there is no reason to believe they did not understand it since they may have lost the power to speak, but we know with autistic kids who do not speak for years, that when they start speaking they start speaking normal language because they have learned and assimilated language while in their autistic non-speaking phase.We know today that it is important to go on speaking to catatonic and comatose people because they hear and they receive that language and they react to it, even if we have no external sign about it. It is amazing at times to find out that a person who gets out of a long comatose state is able to say what he heard and had saved in his memory during that period. It is not systematic. It is not automatic. It is not perfect and extensive. But it is, even if limited. Just the same way there is a womb memory that enables a newborn to remember what it was like in the womb, there is a comatose memory that enables the comatose person when he/she comes out to remember what it was like when they were ""gone,"" and what was said about them.I must say that in 1990 we were still far away from what we know today. The film though is interesting because of the concentration on the people around the sick people. The family for one, at least one mother, the first patient's mother, Ms. Lowe, who is grateful while the awakening lasts but becomes dubious and skeptical when the awakening comes to an end, and Leonard, her son, falls back into the horror of a semi-catatonic state. The doctors are also shown as being over-cautious, and yet they are justified to be so but we cannot get out of the picture their refusal of a free walk in the city for Leonard as being a cause of the change in the ""community"" because the patients all knew about the rebellious state Leonard fell into afterward that also caused a relapse in his disease. The most interesting people are the nurses and other personnel. They are supportive of the change and the new experimental drugs because they want their patients to become more normal people, people with whom they can speak and exchange some conversation. That's the positive point. The medical profession is not necessarily of the torturing brutal unempathetic type. Somewhere they are still human. And that's maybe the most important ""miracle."" The battle for human treatments is not lost before being fought because the professional personnel in these situations or hospital wards just hope their patients' situation can be improved. So, a good film for a hot summer night.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",Awakenings
28,zkonedog,A Rare Gem Of A Film,9,10 March 2017,"When the film career of Robin Williams is in question, there are two bodies of work to be discussed: His comedy (stand-up, Mrs. Doubtfire, Good Morning Vietnam, etc.) and his serious roles (Good Will Hunting, Dead Poets Society, One Hour Photo, etc.). However, there is one film that seems to slip under the radar a bit (I had never heard of it until a friend ""dug it up""), and that is a shame...as ""Awakenings"" is a movie that will touch your spirit.The basic plot of the film (based on the true story of the life experiences of Dr. Oliver Sacks) sees Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Williams) assigned to the neurotic ward of a mental institution, where he quickly becomes fascinated with encephalitis patients, who are literally frozen in stature and have been that way for decades. All but given up on by clinical & clerical hospital staff, Sayer instead pushes the envelope with a radical new drug therapy program that allows him to revive nearly all of the catatonic patients. One of the ""awakened"" in particular, named Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro), begins to actually live a normal life, only to see that existence thrown into doubt once again when the long-term effects of the drug treatment begin to take hold.In terms of plot, this one will really suck you in and have you rooting for the protagonists all the way through. Director Penny Marshall does a remarkable job of creating characters that you will truly feel for, and thus any setback is a huge emotional blow. For the more ""emotionally inclined"" viewers, certain moments will have you cheering out loud, while others will leave you completely devastated.The acting in ""Awakenings"" is also top-notch, as Williams plays the mousy (yet fantastically drive) Dr. Sayer with aplomb, while De Niro turns in a performance unlike any previous or since as the awakened patient who must learn to live in a world that has passed him by for so many years. The auxiliary ""nuthouse"" cast (think ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"") also provide more humor and sincerity to the proceedings.Thus, if you have stumbled across this movie while perusing a film index or trolling through IMDb, don't let the anonymity fool you, as it is well worth your time.",Awakenings

The movie does have a certain charm, but in total the story is contrived and is heaped in sentimentality. The acting is good, but the story is engrossed in wishful thinking and the principal characters are stereotypes. There is the sensitive doctor (played by Robin Williams), the long-suffering patient (played by Robert De Niro), the concerned relatives, the skeptical doctor, the nice orderlies, the supportive nurses, the eccentric patients - all hokey, all contrived, none believable. Literary license if given free reign in this transparent attempt to evoke audience response. Absent in this movie are the day-to-day mundane, yet critical, routines that characterize health care, especially in large institutions. Nor does the movie deal with the ethical or clinical implications of the kind of distorted doctor-patient interactions or of the medical experimentation depicted in this movie. This movie is another attempt by Hollywood to dramatize a topical issue - in this case medical ethics. The results are mixed.

The familiarity of the material, and the predictability of its outcome, is nicely camouflaged by Penny Marshall's understated direction, and by Robin Williams's sensitive (believe it or not) portrayal of the socially disabled doctor who comes to life alongside his patients. If Robert De Niro is less effective in the flashier role it's only because his character is so well adjusted after suddenly emerging from a thirty-year trance.

33,estebangonzalez10,Williams and De Niro deliver moving and touching performances,8,16 September 2015,"""People have forgotten what life is all about. They've forgotten what it is to be alive. They need to be reminded.""Following the huge success of her 80's comedy, Big, director Penny Marshall decided to approach a much more sensitive and serious subject matter in her next film based on Oliver Sacks' semi-biographical book about his work in a ward with patients in catatonic state. Robin Williams was cast to play Dr. Sacks, although the character's name was changed to Dr. Malcolm Sayer, a shy doctor who prior to have been hired at the ward had very little experience working with patients. He was obsessed with researching and doing lab work, but those skills came in handy when he began treating the catatonic patients at the ward. He discovered that several of the patients that had been in the ward for decades had one thing in common: they had survived a rare form of encephalitis, but the disease left them in their current catatonic state. Most of the doctors believed there was no treatment for these patients, but he began to discover that some of them responded to certain stimuli. Not giving up on them, he decides to attend a lecture where he discovers a new drug that had been effective on patients suffering from Parkinson's, and he believes it might just help awake his patients as well. Casting Robin Williams for the role and having released this only two years after the commercial success of Big, one could easily have expected this to be a comedy, but casting Robert De Niro as the other lead easily put to rest that assumption. De Niro had also worked on Goodfellas the same year as this and he continued to be at the prime of his career. In Awakenings he plays Leonard Lowe, one of the patients who has remained in the same state for nearly four decades and who is still being cared for by his mother, Mrs. Lowe (Ruth Nelson), at the clinic. With the approval of the other doctors at the ward and Leonard's mother, he is chosen for a trial run with the drug. It doesn't take too long for Dr. Sayer to see the results he was expecting as Leonard seems to wake up from his catatonic state. The two begin to form a special bond and the positive results induce Sayer to test the drug on the rest of the patients in the ward in a similar way. As we become witnesses of Leonard's awakening we also begin to see life through his eyes as someone who feels he has lost so many years and now wants to enjoy life to the fullest. His awakening serves the reclusive Doctor as a reminder to begin living life and enjoying human interaction. There is a sub plot revolving his relationship with a nurse from the ward played by Julie Kavner, but the main theme is Sayer's relationship with these patients. Marshall's film was nominated for Best Picture, and just like her previous movie it also earned a nomination for the lead actor, De Niro. De Niro does a superb job playing this awakened catatonic patient, and it is evident that he did his homework and studied every single facial and body tic of the real patients. Sacks had filmed his patients in real life during their awakening periods and so there was a lot of material they had to work with. Robin Williams plays a much more restrained character than what we were used to seeing him do, so his performance might not seem as delightful as his other films but he delivers a solid dramatic turn. The third nomination that the film received was for Steven Zaillian's adapted screenplay which was powerful. He didn't win the Oscar for this film, but he went on to win it two years later for his work in Schindler's List. Spielberg said it was his adaptation in Awakenings that earned him the job for his film. This movie is emotional and touching without being manipulative because it sticks to the true story which was definitely one that had to be told in the big screen. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Awakenings
34,jimbo-53-186511,Touching,8,17 January 2015,"Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) is a new doctor working at a local hospital. Sayer takes a particular interest in the catatonic patients and soon discovers patterns in their behaviour - they all have excellent reflexes. Sayer soon deduces that the catatonic victims were all victims of encephalitis which the patients had contracted several years earlier. Sayer discovers through various tests and experiments that these 'catatonic' patients are of sound mind, but their bodies are effectively paralysed. When Sayer learns of a new drug called L-DOPA he believes that this drug could give the catatonic patients a much better quality of life. Sayer is given permission to test this new drug on his test subject Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro). With the test on Lowe being a resounding success, Sayer eventually gets enough funding to administer the drug to all the 'catatonic' patients which essentially gives them a new lease of life...I personally thought that this was a wonderful film which gives the audience an excellent insight into the lives of patients that are catatonic. I believe that the modern interpretation of the illness depicted by Lowe and the others is now known as Locked In Syndrome - whereby the mind functions, but the rest of the body doesn't. Of all the disabilities out there, I suspect that this is one of the worst as it gives you such a low quality of life - being in a wheelchair or being blind doesn't restrict you quite as much as you think (the Paralympics have paved the way for many disabled athletes), but Locked In Syndrome is an entirely different kettle of fish.Lowe and Sayer form a tight bond throughout this film. Once Lowe has received several doses of L-DOPA, he starts to get his life back and understandably wants to take full advantage of the fact that his mind is no longer locked in his body. His new lease of life leads to some touching moments and a few funny moments (the scene where Lowe picks up the electric razor and doesn't know how to use it did make me laugh). It was also interesting to get an insight into the other catatonic patients thoughts once they have received the medication - when they're talking we get to see their various personalities which as I say was both interesting and funny. This also lead to one of the doctors uttering the line 'I preferred them the way they were' which did get a chuckle out of me.De Niro for me is the star of the show. I've always found him to be a good actor, but he very much plays against type here and for me this is probably his best performance. For De Niro to play so against type and to make it work this well means that he deserves extra credit for this role. Williams was OK as well, but he wasn't given as much to do (acting wise). This really was the De Niro and Williams show where the rest of the cast are given little else to do.There are several tender moments in this film (most notably the scene where Paula dances with Lowe in the hospital) - that scene was so touching and moving and was probably one of the best scenes in the film. The film ends strongly, although it is slightly more downbeat than I was expecting.Awakenings is a very good film that is funny, touching, heart-warming, sad & incredibly moved and well-acted. Recommended for fans of moving drama, although I do think that it is a film that everyone should watch.",Awakenings

He went nicely total here, but without overacting his role. He can depict all those compulsive moves a Parkinson patient does. And he does them well that it doesn't look stupid, it just looked as a normal Parkinson patient would look like. Robin Williams also did a good job, although I think I've seen better performances.

42,frankde-jong,The first hour is impressive,7,28 July 2019,"From 1916 to 1926 there was a great outbreak of the epidimic sleeping disease. Since then this disease is very rare. The film, which is based on a book by Oliver Sacks, treats the cases of 15 patients of this disease who have been in a comatose state for at least 30 years in a mental hospital in New York. In 1969 the treatment with L-DOPA has spectacular effects. These effect unfortunately turn out te be only temporary.""Awakenings"" (with Robin Willams in the role of the neurologist that stands for Oliver Sacks himself and Robert de Niro in the role of a patient) is impressive in its first hour. It deals with the question that all beloved ones of comatose patients ask themselves: ""Of how much is he/she aware and is communication still possible?"".After the initial success of the treatment the patients awake after some thirty years. The effect is similar to time travelling. The pitfall with time travelling is that the scenes can become a little to comical. ""Awakenings"" evade this pittfal maybe not perfect but rather well.The main shortcoming of the film lies in the part of Robin William. He plays his role a bit to much as the unwordly professor. It is an awakened patient who has to draw his attention to the flirtations of a nurse. In effect the doctor has its own ""awakening"", the sexual awakening of the eternal bachelor.Films with a brilliant first hour and a disappointing second hour are not unusual. They are however most common in the horror genre, if hunting for effects takes over in the second part. In the drama genre it is in general more rare.",Awakenings
43,brchthethird,Robert de Niro and Robin Williams make a great pair in this touching medical drama,9,13 November 2014,"Directed by Penny Marshall, and starring Robert de Niro and Robin Williams (along with a few other familiar faces), AWAKENINGS is a wonderful film which explores the deep-seated human need for personal connections and the vitality they bring to life. Robert de Niro plays Leonard Lowe, a patient who has been catatonic for 30 years. Robin Williams plays Dr. Malcolm Sayer, a neurologist who works at the hospital where Leonard and many others like him are patients. The plot is about how Dr. Sayer treats these patients with an experimental drug and monitors how it affects them, with Leonard being his first/initial test case. At this point, I'll refrain from describing the plot. What needs to be said more than anything is that the character work by de Niro and Williams is some of the best I've seen from them, and really showed a devotion to their craft. In particular, de Niro stands out because his role as a catatonic patient probably required extreme physical discipline as well as having to internalize his character's thoughts a lot of the time. Robin Williams is also excellent as the introvert doctor who gradually comes to an awakening of his own. The film isn't particularly subtle about what the audience is supposed to take from these two parallel characters, but the subject is treated deftly and not spoon-fed. I also liked the insight into the workings of a hospital in the late 60's, and the interactions between the various members of the supporting cast. In particular, Julie Kavner (voices Marge on The Simpsons) gave a wonderful, understated performance as the head nurse, and who also develops a special bond with Dr. Sayer. The only minor complaint I have is that de Niro might have gone too method at a couple points in the film, with his characterization bordering on the cartoonish. Still, he manages to make his character accessible and sympathetic. Overall, I felt that this film was a sweet look at human interaction, love, and making up for lost time. Highly recommended.",Awakenings

This is a solid heartwarming tale of a doctor helping some patients to reclaim a piece of their humanity while also finding his own. I found it to be quite heartwarming, and the performance from Robin WIlliams was brilliant. They throw in a little comedy here and there, which was fine, but might have been a bit insensitive because it is all built around the actual mental issues of certain characters. I was completely engaged by this movie, but there was a little something missing in the way it ended. It both lacked satisfaction, and didn't provide quite as strong of an emotional punch as I expected. This is the type of movie I anticipated would have me in tears enough to go through multiple tissues, but aside from getting a little choked up, I wasn't hit all that hard. Aside from my minor gripes about the ending, I was still caught up in Awakenings and I can see why this is the kind of ""inspired by a true story"" film that would get nominated for Best Picture.",Awakenings
45,classicalsteve,A Film About What It Means to Be Alive: Superb Performances by De Niro and Williams,9,16 May 2020,"We all take it for granted. We wake, we dress, we eat, we talk to people, and we go out into the world. And yet a small number of people are denied the simple pleasures of life. Some of them are in semi-catatonic states. In the 1920's there was a worldwide pandemic of encephalitis lethargica. Some victims of the pandemic when they were children experienced a catatonic state around the time of the transition from childhood to adolescence in the 1920's and 1930's. The film begins in the 1930's when a boy named Leonard begins to lose his ability to function as a normal human being.Fast-forward to 1969. Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) is a new research clinician in a chronic hospital. The patients there have the same chronic states and have little chance of recovery. One ward consists of catatonic patients. He and his nurse Eleanor Costello (Julie Kavner) begin to experiment on the catatonic patients. The medical community believes they are largely vegetables with no mind inside. However, they find through their research that even though the patients are unable to respond as normal people, they are ""alive inside"". Experiments include catching balls and studying their brainwaves which show activity when their names are mentioned.Sayer decides to try an experimental drug, L-Dopa, which had been used on animals with Parkinson's disease. Robert De Niro plays the main character patient, Leonard Lowe who we saw as a boy at the beginning of the film. They decide to use him as a kind of guinea pig with the drug L-Dopa. His mother recounts Leonard's slow progression from a normal boy to someone with a enigmatic disease. Sayers and the clinic get permission from his mother, and they administer a small dosage of the drug. Nothing happens. They up the dosage, and still nothing happens. On a whim, Sayer administers a high dosage. And Leonard ""comes alive"". The other patients are given the drug and awaken as well.The patients experience rebirth, and I believe this is the main message of the film. They want to experience everything and find the pettiness of the world incomprehensible. Even Dr. Sayer's life seems mundane and at one point Leonard, late in the film, admonishes him for not taking advantage of those things most people take for granted. They go on outings and even go to a dance. However, Leonard starts to go into a kind redevelopment of the disease.In reality, the drug L-Dopa was administered as a double-blind experiment. Leonard's character essentially represents the initial group. When the first group showed success, the other group was given the real drug, which represents the rest of the patients. Overall a very good film about the mysteries of the mind, what it means to be alive, and the dangers and uncertainties about untested drugs.",Awakenings

47,KnightsofNi11,Beautiful film,8,13 May 2011,"Films based on a true story, when done right, have a certain nuance to them that gloriously elevates them to a deeper emotional level. It's evident that Awakenings has a lot of respect for its source material. It takes its true story and dramatizes it just enough to make it a very compelling drama that doesn't tip too far into the realm of melodrama. Awakenings takes place in the Summer of 1969 when Dr. Malcolm Sayer, played by Robin Williams, begins work at a mental hospital. There are numerous patients at the hospital with a disease which puts them in a state of catatonic paralysis. Dr. Sayer takes a particular interest in one of the patients, Leonard Lowe, played by Robert De Niro, and sets out to find a cure for the disease. It's a tearjerker and a heart wrencher, but it is all done so beautifully.Awakenings puts you in that somber and entranced mood that only good films can put you in. It takes a little while to get the ball rolling, but once it does you lose yourself in this movie. Everything draws you in . The music, the quiet direction, the fantastic acting, everything. Your sympathy for these characters only grows during the entire film despite how idealistically dramatic the film tends to get. It has an excellently captured mood which makes your emotions run deeper and deeper as the film develops. For a while everything seems to be going fine and there seems to be little conflict in the film as Dr. Sayer creates the drug to cure these patients. And just when you feel like there isn't enough going on in this film, the true meaning of the story emerges and blooms into a beautiful and moving tale.Now you just can't talk about Awakenings without mentioning Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. Their performances are truly incredible. Robin Williams goes far outside his normal range when he plays a painfully shy and incredibly timid doctor who has a very difficult time interacting with people. Robert De Niro is catatonic for half the film but the way he pulls of his character awakening from this thirty year long catatonic state is incredible. The character of Leonard Lowe is tragic yet brilliant in the way he is designed and developed. Your sympathy for this character runs so deep and watching everything that happens to him in this movie is absolutely heart wrenching. Rarely does a study of the human mind and the human condition elicit such incredibly moving results as we see in Awakenings. This movie provokes a lot of thought and a lot of reflection on what it means to be human and how we perceive our own existences. The essence and meaning of this film is truly profound and is a moving miracle to watch on screen.Awakenings is an excellent film and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Dramas like these just aren't capable of reaching a certain status in my opinion on films, but there is no way I can deny that this film is very well made and provokes a lot of thought. The last half of the movie is profoundly better than the first, yet the film obviously wouldn't have had the same effect without all of the setup. I could easily see myself watching this film again and maybe catching on to a few more things earlier on that I may have missed. Awakenings is a quiet film with so much heart and feeling that you just wont forget what you have seen here. I highly recommend it.",Awakenings

50,ajs-10,Heartwarming with some great performances...,8,27 March 2011,"This is a heart-warming tale about a doctor and his work to find a cure for his patients who are stuck in a catatonic state. There are some great performances and it has many ups and downs along the way. It is based on a book by Oliver Sacks, a true story which will play at your heartstrings at times. More of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please help get Leonard back into bed while I write the next paragraph).Dr. Malcolm Sayer has always worked in research because he doesn't really get on with people. He has to take a job at a hospital where he has no choice but to work with the patients. There he meets, amongst his patients, Leonard Lowe, who has been in a catatonic state for thirty years. With the help of his assistant, Eleanor Costello, Dr. Sawyer carries out a series of tests to discover just what is wrong with him. He eventually discovers it is to do with an encephalitis epidemic back in the 1920's and it is now the late 60's. Convinced he can find as cure, reads up on all the current medications and finds an experimental drug that might do the trick. His boss, Dr. Kaufman, will only let him try it on one patient, he chooses Leonard and thus begins the awakenings but will it last, and what are the consequences? I'll have to leave it there so as not to be beaten by the Spoiler Police.This is a really well made film with a beautiful score by Randy Newman, enhanced with many songs, both old and new. Great performances all round, particularly from Robert De Niro as Leonard Lowe and Robin Williams as Dr. Malcolm Sayer, who both went and observed Oliver Sacks and his patients prior to making this film, and it showed. I also have to mention Julie Kavner, it's nice to see the voice of Marge Simpson as a real person for a change. Honourable mentions also go to; Ruth Nelson as Mrs. Lowe (Leonard's mother), John Heard as Dr, Kaufman and it was also nice to see a brief cameo from Max von Sydow as Dr. Peter Ingham.Although it starts off a little schmaltzy, this film grows into an engrossing drama with engaging characters and an interesting plot. There are hints of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) here and there, but I can forgive that, after all, it's not a bad film to be compared with. Over all, it's pretty good and well worth a viewing Recommended.My score: 7.6/10",Awakenings
51,itamarscomix,Very emotional,8,3 March 2012,"An excellent little drama, that was practically overlooked at its release and remains underrated today, Awakenings succeeded in aging better than most films from the late 80's and early 90's, and in particular remains one of the most emotionally effective films ever made in the US. It might legitimately be said that the emotional content is piled on too high, at times forcibly or even exploititively, but the emotional response is still very authentic and very intense. Awakenings rejects the viewers' resistance and may move the most cynical of them. It boasts excellent performances from two stars who were still at their peak - Robert De Niro and Robin Williams; though for my own taste, I liked Williams' surprisingly subtle and mellow performance more than De Niro's intense, Oscar nominated one.The film's biggest weakness, for me, was that it failed to follow through on some of its more interesting points. A great deal of emphasis is put on the relationship between Williams' and De Niro's characters, and especially on Dr. Sayer's (Williams) personal journey, but not enough on the implications of some of the comments made throughout the film - what were the patients feeling during their long catatonic states? Were they fully aware of their environments? And more importantly - how do you deal with losing several decades of your life? Leonard (De Niro) seemed to be having an easier time than most patients in dealing with this, there are a couple of moments like him staring at the mirror or being bemused by hearing rock music for the first time, but just how unthinkably difficult these adjustments would be for him are only briefly explored through short scenes with some of the other patients. Leonard's rebellion over not being allowed to leave the hospital (a scene almost too reminiscent of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) is mostly triggered by fear of regressing to his previous state and not by the unimaginable shock of suddenly finding himself forty years older.That doesn't detract much from the emotional impact that Awakenings hold, or from the fact that it's constantly engaging and enticing. I'm not completely at ease with the ending that puts far too much emphasis on the changes Sayer went through and far too little on Lenoard's own perspective, but it makes for a good and satisfying ending, and for a nearly flawless film experience.",Awakenings

A courageous doctor, Malcolm Sayer, tried different methods to revive these patients and eventually succedds, but after a while all the patients returned in their previous state.This movie has many great elements: the plot and the writing are very intelligent, and even though the movie is based on a true story, there are some moments of hope. Penny Marshall's direction is marvellous, much like when she directed BIG with Tom Hanks. And the performances: Robin Williams is excellent in one of his first serious roles and as usual he is both likeable and struggles to make his mission work. Robert De Niro's performance is also near-perfect, as a patient that with the help of Williams reconnects with the real life. Julie Kavner and Max von Sydow in supporting roles are also very good.

59,HEFILM,One frustratingly tragic step from greatness,9,16 December 2005,"Fascinating source material probably deserves half of the credit in this case, it was a great film waiting to be made. This said, especially Deniro, who sadly since this film has almost constantly taken roles beneath him or gone over the top in roles he obviously didn't even understand or was taking for the money, is fantastic in what I'd argue has been to date his last great dramatic performance. Not that he might not do it again with the right material but that seems less and less likely. All departments, directing, music, acting are first rate. The trouble is that in a film this great in so many ways there is a central dramatic and potentially horrifying question the film doesn't even ask. This could be considered a minor spoiler if you want to stop reading but it really isn't. Anyway the central issue here is do these ""frozen"" patients who are ""unfrozen"" by this miracle medication remember what has been happening during their years in ""freeze"" If they did or do ""feel"" what is going on while ""frozen"" do they think, then they deserve to be treated as human beings, or you could argue deserve to be put out of the misery rather than suffer so cruelly. It seems to be too important a question and deep a one for the filmmakers to want to deal with. A cowardly stance that robs the film from that step into one of the greats. A real shame. Or more disturbingly no one even thought to ask the question, or the answer was cut out of either the script of the final film.

60,roghache,Extraordinary & poignant tale of dual awakenings,9,4 April 2006,"This is an absolutely magnificent and incredibly moving story, all the more poignant since fact based, and an under rated, lesser known movie for its two stars, Robin Williams and Robert DeNiro.The film chronicles the tale of a shy young research neurologist, Dr. Malcolm Sayer, who obtains a position in a Bronx mental hospital, which houses a number of catatonic patients, victims of an encephalitis epidemic several decades earlier. After some observations on its inadvertent effects on a patient, Dr. Sayer experimentally tries the Parkinson drug, L-dopa on a patient named Leonard Lowe, with amazing results. Leonard awakens from his coma, reconnects with his ecstatic mother whom he hasn't known since a teenager, eagerly embraces the simplest of pleasures in his new world, and even embarks upon a romance with a girl visiting the facility. Dr. Sayer moves on to treat other patients as well, with similar results. The formerly catatonic victims awaken to a new life and flabbergasted relatives, though these patients must now readjust to their much older age, their missed years, and sometimes news of family members who have passed away or spouses who have divorced them during these intervening years. However, all is not well for these patients and their newfound life. Leonard begins to develop side effects, ever increasing tics, and alas, his awakening is short lived. The effects of the drug wear off within two or three months, and, sadly, the patients revert back to their former catatonic state.The performances of the two stars, both extremely versatile actors, are beyond stellar. Robert DeNiro is amazing in his portrayal of Leonard, both in his catatonic state and later as the eager but vulnerable adult given new life, only to realize tragically that it is to be quickly snatched away. Indeed, as another also noted, the scene where Leonard has his first (and last) dance with his new love is one of the saddest in all the movie world. Although DeNiro was nominated, he fully deserved to win an Oscar for his performance in this movie.Robin Williams is also endearing as the bashful, somewhat reclusive Dr. Sayer. Indeed, this is a tale of two awakenings. Not only do we see the patients aroused from their catatonic slumber, but the doctor, hitherto wrapped up in his solitary earthworm research and experiencing little meaningful human interaction, is also awakened socially and emotionally by his experiences. He develops a heartfelt emotional bond with his patients, especially Leonard, and even warms to a potential romance himself (or at least a good friendship) with the nurse, Eleanor Costello, who has shared his experiences, the joys and the sorrows, with these unfortunate patients.Great supporting cast, including Julie Kavner as Eleanor. My hat goes off to the film's director, Penny Marshall, who for me always remains Laverne, star of her old TV series, Laverne and Shirley!It's unfortunate, as another also commented, that someone sneaked in an f-word, so inappropriate for this film. I guess modern cinema simply cannot manage without.This is a poignant tearjerker, to be sure, but comes across as an uplifting and inspiring story rather than, as you might picture, a depressing one. These adults were given new life and their loved ones were able to reconnect, however briefly. It teaches us to appreciate our own lives and our loved ones, enjoying each day to the fullest. Though it's certainly a tragic, heartbreaking, and seemingly cruel ending for these patients and their families, the personal transformation of the shy doctor leaves some sense of fulfillment. This film should have received a lot more attention and credit. It's one of the best roles for both its extremely talented and deservedly famous stars, DeNiro and Williams.",Awakenings

62,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Appalling.,1,30 March 2012,"I'm not too sure what I was hoping for going into Awakenings, but it turned out to be the worst case scenario. Written by Steven Zaillain and directed by Penny Marshall, it tells the true story of a doctor who uncovers a miracle drug which he uses to heal a ward of comatose patients. The narrative awkwardly splits itself into focusing on the doctor, played by Robin Williams who you can tell is in a dramatic role because he has a beard and is wearing a leather jacket, and one of the patients named Leonard Lowe, played by Robert De Niro.The focus is split between the two of them, but not in a very cohesive way at all. Instead, we open up focusing entirely on Doctor Sayer, after a brief look at Lowe's beginning of his disease, and spend the entire first half of the film just with him. Then, as the drug is introduced to Leonard we change the focus almost entirely to him and Sayer becomes a background character instead. It's a really jarring shift in character and the change was hard to adjust to. The focus of the film becomes how someone reacts to the world after decades in a comatose state, which is obviously where they were headed all along so certainly there could have been a more fluid way to transition into that.Marshall never establishes a proper tone, constantly in this limbo between comedy and drama that feels awkward, inappropriate and ultimately just falls flat. At the start it wasn't that hard of a film to watch, but around the halfway point it began to become increasingly dull until the last half hour was almost unbearable in it's tiresomeness. Zaillain's script never takes on the real issues that these characters would face, taking the heavy themes and glossing over them aside from a few scenes of apparent emotional manipulation.Williams gives a serviceable portrayal but his character gets tossed aside once the ""more interesting"" one comes along, and De Niro gives maybe the worst performance of his career. He got an Oscar nomination for it which is just a hilarious display of their tendency to throw any kind of award to a popular actor playing a disability, because this performance is so absurdly hammed up it's borderline appalling. His whole display is laughable and every time I was supposed to feel for this character (as I was so unsubtly told by the writer/director) I ended up laughing.Toss in an unnecessary and dismally undeveloped romance subplot for each character and this is a film that doesn't know what it's doing but makes sure it ticks all of the boxes this kind of wreck is made to be. Awakenings is the worst kind of exploitative garbage and it does a disservice to the real-life people it's portraying.",Awakenings
63,jayjaycee,Medicine labeled with Carpe Diem,8,3 November 2019,"""Awakenings"" is a 1990 drama directed by Penny Marshall starring Robert DeNiro and Robin Williams. Now that Spooktober has finally ended, I can proceed reviewing other genres as well and I thought I would start the November with a drama that was recommended to me by my former co-worker. She has an extraordinary good taste in films, so I trusted her so much that I decided to just buy it blindly. As I expected, that was nothing but a great investment. First of all, it's mentionable what stellar cast legendary director Penny Marshall has assembled. With DeNiro and Williams as a powerful duo in the leading roles she also got prominent names, such as Julie Kavner, John Heard and Mad von Sydow. There's so much talent in this touching film based on a true story. I mean, besides DeNiro's ingenious performance, the other actors and actresses that play catatonic patients are convincing throughout as well. Accompanied by a soothing musical score, the beautifully captured images are full of colours and authencity. While the pace of the storytelling might be flawed and is too slow in the beginning and too fast in the end, it still manages to show a balanced plot development. Next to all the medical aspects of the drama, it was also not afraid to target the philosophical questions behind all the mediation usage: How can patients who weren't able to live for more than thirty years ever reintegrate into the modern society that they had no connection to? Furthermore, it shows how patients were treated back in the day, they were neither jailed nor free. In the end, it teaches us as the audience something more important: We should not take everything for granted, be glad that we're alive and healthy and not cursed with a sickness. It's justified to say that it's a more uplifting drama that celebrates life instead of mourning the misery. All in all, this somehow overlooked motion picture is a cheering take on living with illness, lead by magnificent performances and an flawed yet excellent plot and it reminds us that there are more important things in life. It's almost like it has ""Carpe Diem"" labeled on it. In the end, I'm glad that this film was recommended to me. I knew she would not disappoint me with her choice.",Awakenings

The cast is simply excellent, having a pair of actors like Williams and De Niro together in the same film its just worthy. Robert De Niro's performance was flawless, there's no doubt that it was an Oscar nomination role, Robin Williams was also great as Dr. Malcolm Sayer, one of his best performances ever. The secondary roles from Penelope Ann Miller, Julie Kavner, John Heard and Ruth Nelson were very good and gave the necessary support to the movie. This was a enjoyable and tear dropping movie that touches the deepest region of your heart and soul and it will make you appreciate the simple things in life. Recommendable for everyone.",Awakenings
65,jldmp1,Reanimated,8,3 July 2006,"This is celebrated for the wrong reasons, I think. The arc of tragedy/elation/tragedy is nothing new; the 'elation' bits have long since been co-opted as the greeting card sentiment that inhabits the center of most Hollywood dramas.If you scrape away the cloying confectionery goop, there's some pretty solid movie construction underneath. Three things pop out...First off, this is not about reanimated people -- it's about reanimated movies. The period covered in the film is right before VHS technology, so the only convenient visual data storage medium was--you guessed it-- movies. Marshall smartly gets Von Sydow to translate this for us. The 'awakened' people live in the movie memories taken from the time they fell 'asleep'. And she makes another period film within, starring DeNiro; surprisingly smart and effective.Secondly, the presence of Ruth Nelson is no accident -- compare the elements and tone here to those in ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"". Third, the movie itself invests in the cinematic world of 1969. I don't mean the costumes and settings, although Marshall gets that right - I mean the grain of the film, the framing, the pull-in with the lens technique...all evoke the film-making of that period. Good congruence of subject and medium.Note also that Williams, the perpetual juvenile, acts his age, to our great relief. The only other time he's done this is in ""Garp"".

The movie has its pace, and is crafted with special care. Williams is once more the portrait of the sensitive and shy person that can be decisive at some times. The supporting actors are all top-notch. But fact is that this movie wouldn't be the same without that walking, talking legend that is Robert de Niro, who gives one of his best performances ever as one of the patients who manages to grasp life once more. His technique is perfected to the point that we can't imagine him stopping after the end of the take. And has he? During his time on screen, he gives one of the most difficult actor's work to ever be achieved, and it's a shame that he didn't get the oscar that year. The moments when he is half-way between illness and health are among the best performances ever. A definite tear-jerker, it will break you heart, but is a great test to director Marshall and she comes out really nice. Kudos to Randy Newman's touchingly epic score.",Awakenings
67,The_Core,Profoundly and deeply moving,9,18 April 2000,"A stunning and deeply moving film.  Robert De Niro gives a performance that's rarely equalled on the big screen (easily beating Dustin Hoffman's performance in ""Rainman""), and Robin Williams is superb as well as Dr. Malcolm Sayer.  These are two characters that we really come to care about, and the chemistry between them is palpable.  These actors (especially De Niro) should have won Oscars for their roles in this movie.
There's little audience manipulation here... most of the scenes ring very true.  There is humor here, and pathos, and joy and innocence.  This is one film I never get tired of seeing.  If you let it, it will touch your heart, and maybe even change your life.  Aside from a few predictable elements in the plot, this movie shines like a supernova -- it's much better than either ""The Doctor"" or ""Regarding Henry"" (two other movies with vaguely similar plots and similarly high production values).

The ward looks just like the one I worked on for years at a State Mental Hospital, even the same design of 50's furniture.The movie is several steps above a Lifetime Television production (which it resembles). Another reviewer said that De Niro was hamming his performance... NO. A dopamine compromised or Parkinson's patient looks exactly like De Niro did only maybe worse. The ending statement was a stupid platitude. Robbins says ""the chemical has stopped working but the human spirit advances through friendships family blah blah blah..."" what a lot of solace that would be to one of those patients.In this movie one can see the provenance of Cocoon.This movie should get about a 6.5 .

But will it last?Based on a true story, 'Awakenings' has as many happy moments as it does sad ones, and its effectiveness is a result from some sensitive direction, an affecting score, and strong performances. Robin Williams excelled in comedic roles, but he was also a wonderful dramatic actor, and here he conveys so much through subtle expressions.Overall, this is just a really nice film, even if it forces you to watch the final few minutes through watery eyes. The story gets very existential near the end, forcing you to confront what you might take for granted on a daily basis while lingering on the importance of human contact. Excellent.9/10",Awakenings

The fact that it was based on a true story makes it doubly fascinating and brilliant. Robin Williams show us his dramatic ability in Awakenings, and Robert DeNiro's performance is probably one of the best acting jobs I have ever seen. I think one thing that makes this movie stand out is the amount of respect and empathy shown, in the direction, for all of the characters.., even the initially-resistant and conservative director of the hospital, played by William Heard. This must have been a difficult movie to execute, because some complex, abnormal psychology, as well as pathology, is involved. Technical lexicon is kept to a minimum, though, and handled in a very concise, comprehensible fashion. Julie Kavner's character, as the head nurse in the ward, is memorable. She shows that sometimes, kindness is the cure.A movie that compels us to use both our intuition and our analysis to a greater degree, Awakenings stands with very few other movies as a testament to the tenacity of the human spirit.",Awakenings

Nothing is wasted -- not a glance, not a word, not a gesture. The characters are vibrant and true to life (as a counselor to chronic patients, I found myself laughing out loud at Dr. Sayer's initial bewilderment -- I'd been there myself), the situations poignant but not overdone.I usually resent movies that make my cry because I hate feeling manipulated.

75,jcanettis,"Great Film, Amazing Performances",9,7 November 2004,"""Awakenings"" is a film based on a true story. The plot is about Dr. Sayer (Williams), a young and shy neurologist, newly arrived in a mental hospital. Being there, he finds a group of patients who suffer from an unknown form of dementia; these people are completely disconnected from their environment, yet Dr. Sayer discovers that they occasionally respond unexpectedly to some cues. Facing the incredulity of his fellow physicians, he tries an experimental treatment, with his test subject being Leonard (De Niro), a man who has entered this catatonic stage since his childhood, and who has only his elderly mother to take care of him. To everyone's great astonishment, L-Dopa, the drug used by Sayer, works with Leonard: He ""awakens"" from his catatonic state, thus persuading the hospital authorities to let Dr. Sayer treat the other patients suffering from this disease, as well. Suddenly, the patients who were statute-like until then, become happy, living, people. Everything looks great, yet unfortunately things consequently turn out sour...The story is simple, yet powerful. Although it is very depressing, the message boiling down from the film is optimistic, despite the appearances: Life is good, so try to enjoy it while you can.The performance of De Niro and Williams are both amazing; however, De Niro should perhaps get a slightly higher grade (if there can be a grade higher than ""amazing""), since his role as catatonic Leonard is much more difficult to play. Of course, it would be unfair if I did not stress that the rest of the cast is also doing a fine job.In brief, ""Awakenings"" is a great film. 9/10.",Awakenings
76,Travis_Bickle01,Stunning performances by both leading actors,8,7 September 2005,"""Awakenings"" is more than just two brilliant actors casted in something that might first look like a cheap over sentimental Saturday night movie. This movie tells a story of hope, a story of courage,... It's the true story of Dr. Malcolm Sayer and he believe in an awakening of his patients. It's hard to say which actor gave the best performance in this movie. Robin Williams as well as Robert De Niro were both amazing. I love Williams the most when he plays characters like Dr. Sayer. Those intimate portraits of truly good and honest men, like Sean in ""Good Will Hunting"". Brilliant! Robert De Niro was great as well. Touching and a bit a sad role as well, but nevertheless truly great. ""Awakenings"" is by far Penny Marshall's best movie as well. I also like the double meaning of the title, at least I suppose it has two meanings. It the first place, the awakenings refers to the patients who awake from their 'non-active' state. But it think the title also refers to the people who are taking care of the patients and I think Robin Williams mentioned it in the movie as well. When those patients awake, after a while the realise that they have missed quite some time of their own life. They didn't experience a lot of things, things that might not seem that important, but nothing is less true. And by seeing what those patients missed, the other people realize what is really important in life and how lucky they are that they really have a life and can experience it as well.But that's only how I see it.

Robin Williams and Robert De Niro again illustrate how old pros can handle challenging roles convincingly. I can't imagine this film doing a lot of business at the box office; there's nothing to appeal to teens.

Sat down to watch it again last night. First, the music: I have adored almost everything master Newman has penned all these years he's been at the ivories. There are only a few of his caliber in the States who can reach the depths of emotion on so many levels. His soundtrack has always had a very warm place in my heart and one can just enjoy it on it's own and return to it over and over.The actors: if I had to choose the manic versus the subdued Robin Williams I'd say that his quiet and controlled energies are even more overpowering than his ability to make us laugh right down to the bottom of mirth. If there has been a more effective part where he has brought into being a more humane and vulnerable person than I have not seen it.De Niro: what can you say about this man? He has no limits to what he can imagine and project. His portrayal of the tortured adult with a strange illness is so incredible that when he ""awakens"" we just have to cry with joy.The rest of the cast are perfect in all ways. This is a film that I come back to when I need to feel centered, need to be reminded what life is worth living for. This and ""Contact"" often help me get back to that point where life is livable.

83,bobc-5,Finely tuned tear jerker with just a few flaws,7,25 September 2000,"I don't think it is a spoiler to tell you that this movie is really about two ""awakenings"". The main one concerns patients who have been left in an apparently catatonic state due to a poorly understood post-encephalitic syndrome. Dr. Sayer recognizes this and manages to awaken these patients after decades of sleeping through life. This part of the story is handled excellently, creating a wonderful balance of suspense, entertainment, and just enough lightly handled melodrama to occasionally leave you justifiably teary-eyed. De Niro is the glue which holds this part together even though he barely appears in the first hour of the movie. As he always does in his best performances, he makes all the actors around him look outstanding while he does nothing more or less than become exactly the character he is supposed to be.The second awakening is that of Dr. Sayer himself, a timid, insecure, and socially withdrawn researcher who much like his patients has been mostly sleepwalking through life. From this experience comes the hope that he too will finally awaken. Unfortunately, this part of the story is presented with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer blow to the head. It's entirely predictable and made that much worse by the terrible overacting of Robin Williams and the use of a painfully stereotypical evil administrative-type doctor. But it isn't so bad as to seriously detract from the rest of this wonderful story, so it is well worth sitting through for the pleasure of experiencing the full package.",Awakenings

And I distinctly remember seeing Awakenings. There were two scenes that stuck to my memory ever since. Number one: the scene where Robin Williams recites the poem by Rainer Maria Rilke. Although it was only the English translation of this German poem, I immediately understood the beauty of it and the analogy to the Robert DeNiro character. I also remember going to the library on the following Monday and borrowing a book with poems by Rilke. I learned the poem off by heart and I can still quote it.

I was 13 going on 14 and the movie, the performances but especially the subject matter touched me immeasurably.It is one of the few films and books that complement each other, in the best sense of that word. Both are unique in their own way, but depend on the other. The movie conveys many emotions and truths that the book sometimes buries behind its analytical character. And the book gives us a real sense of what the day-to-day struggles of these patients were.Robert De Niro and Robin Williams fulfill similar functions, because as individuals they are very much opposites and yet represent a complete picture of empathy and desire.Remembering the scenes, the book and my life, the sadness over Mr. Williams death starts to unfold.

This is one of the movies to remind us that no one really needs a supernatural theme or pure fiction to produce an impressive film. A typical love/romance story is not a 'must-have' in order to have a touching scenario. It's not everyday that we get to catch such high quality movies, I can't understand why this one did not receive any Academy Awards, to be honest. What else do you need to call it a masterpiece? All in all, I certainly recommend Awakenings -if you still haven't seen it, do check it out. You will not regret.",Awakenings

Story says thousand things in a subtle and simple manner. But what impresses most is the acting from Robin William. He is greatno he is amazing, brilliant and makes you feel how it hurts when one fails and it gives pleasure and satisfaction when one of those patients behaves normally. Now Robert De Niro he is good very good. The way he enacts role and says things through his emotions is the real essence. Lastly everyone in the movie acts beautifully.

103,tvmovienews,Very Awakening,8,5 August 2013,"Awakenings (1990)This film is amazing. It is biographical drama based on Oliver Sacks's 1973 memoir with the same name. Awakening tells the powerful story of Dr. Malcolm Sayer played by Robin Williams, who plays a fictionalized version of British neurologist Olver Sacks. In 1969 he experienced incredible results after he administered a drug called L-Dopa (which is commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease), to patients who had been in a catatonic state since the 1917-28 epidemic of encephalitis lethargica. These patients 'awaken' after decades of catatonia and are forced to adapt to their new life in a new time. The performances by both Robert De Niro and Robin Williams are spectacular and moving. In fact, Robert De Niro narrowly missed out on winning an Academy Award for his performance as Leonard Lowe, one of the patients that Dr Sayer treats. It has been years since I have watched a film that has moved me enough to get me close to turning on the water works, but I am man enough to admit I could feel a couple swelling in the eyes on this. It is incredible to think this is based on a true story, and makes you reconsider how insignificant our daily problems in life are compared to what these people have gone through. The things we take for granted are emphasised in this truly touching story. Do yourself a favour and watch this film.

104,melinetto,brilliant performances from Williams and De Niro,8,2 August 2021,"I always say that i like a movie which is based on a true story. And this film is no different. Furthermore, a film that has a great script like this one and with these cast i actually can't believe why i didn't watch it until recently.Robin Williams who plays Dr. Malcom Sayer is amazing. Dr. Sayer who faces some difficulties with human relations. He doesn't communicate with them, he's bad at human contact. Clearly, he doesn't understand people and can't find to make sense any of their behaviours. However, he's kind hearted, polite and simple man in a good way. He's such a sweet guy. And Mr. Williams externalizes that character really good. He plays with his emotion and so unpretentious and modest. Brilliant performance from him. And Mr. De Niro, hands down, it's one of his incredible performances and such a powerful example of method acting.As i said it before, it's a very good script. Steven Zaillian whom usually i enjoy very much of his scripts did a good job with well written adapted-screenplay and characters.To sum up, this is a good movie with amazing performances, go watch it!",Awakenings

There are certain films though, that make an instant, and lasting, impression on you; Awakenings is one such film that did that to me.The film is very moving, and it's remarkable to think that this genuinely happened. Whenever I've seen the film, I always get emotional. It just had that effect on me.Robin Williams gives an excellent performance as Malcolm Sayer, and shows how good a dramatic actor he was for another reason altogether; Sayer is quite a shy character, and Williams was well known for playing outgoing and loud characters. There are moments of humour in his performance, but Williams plays the role completely straight and succeeds admirably. Robert De Niro was Oscar nominated for his role as Leonard, and it's no surprise; he goes through every emotion and gets so into the role that it's hard to think of another actor in the part.

THESE are the things that matter. This is what we'd forgotten - the simplest things"" Finally, I had the chance to watch Awakenings. My brother recommended it for me years ago, and since he is not into movies, so once he is captured by a movie, I know it's a good one. Apart from my brother, I found Awakenings is very beautiful and heartwarming. It has also some light scenes. They are not many, but sufficient for a movie that deals with catatonic conditions. Everyone here is perfect playing his role, and I mean everyone, from the two leads to the secondary roles. For Robert De Niro, he is excellent through the entire movie especially through the scenes where he acts as if he can't control his muscles. I think these scenes are difficult enough for any actor to make, but he brilliantly executed them. But frankly, I loved Robin Williams as Dr. Sayer or Dr. Oliver Sacks, the true neurologist whose book is that the movie is based on more. Here he is nerd, earnest, hopeful.Finally, despite being nominated for three Oscar awards, I think it's underrated, at least among the audience. And don't forget to bring some tissues.",Awakenings

It portrays the humanity of a group of doctors, that is inspired by the compassionate Dr.Sayer. They manage to revive a group of living statues from catatonicism including Leonard Lowe, a boy who lost 30 years of his film from childhood to a mystery disease that has paralysed his mind.However, as they become human beings again they find it difficult to assimilate back into normal life. They struggle to cope with the new world around them, yet they remind the doctors and the hospital staff what life is really about. The simple things that are neglected are what really matter, which is beautifully recreated by the recovering patients. We, as human beings always try to find difficult and complex solutions to our lives - what we always neglect are the basics, the fundamental parts of life - freedom, health, friendship; and these are what need to be addressed within our lives for true happiness.This film was extremely poignant and touching without being over sentimental and patronising. De Niro and Williams capture the great beauty of the human spirit that lies within us - that inspires compassion, love and care. This film is extremely profound and really made me rethink my life. I highly recommend it.",Awakenings

112,themkody,I could watch the ending over and over again and still be equally moved every time,9,29 March 2011,"I recently watched this movie for the fourth time or so. This is truly a powerful and magical film, sparkling with emotions and good acting in almost every scene. You can tell that everyone involved with this film wanted it to be good. Not just good, but perfect (and the latter is an understatement.) I can't praise De Niro's performance enough, it is one of his finest performances since ""Taxi Driver"". Despite being overshadowed by De Niro, Robin Williams pulls off a noteworthy performance. I wish people would one day look back on Awakenings as one of the best movies ever made, the same way that people are looking back on Shawshank today. But sadly, I doubt that will ever happen. This film will most likely be forgotten as time passes. I'm never gonna forget this film, it's gonna stay with me until death.I often find myself comparing this film to The Shawshank Redemption. Both films have two great themes in common: hope and faith. Both films tell a great story: how two men (Leonard Lowe and Andry Dufresne) are locked up, and how both eventually finds redemption through friendship. While DeNiro and Williams are the stars of the movie, enough screen time is given to the staff & other patients too, which is good. I found myself being excited, watching Leonard Lowe interacting with different people, and how they feel for him (and the other way around.)The movie raises a handful of questions, including how our society is today; for example, how some people forgot what it actually means to live, that some people take too many things for granted. This film works very well on a thought-provoking level, as well as on an emotional level. The ending will be very divisive (which I won't spoil) but I came to appreciate it more and more after repeated viewings. Ultimately, after watching it for the fourth time, I couldn't think of a better ending.Probably the best emotional film I've ever seen (along with Shawshank). The film doesn't have a single cheesy scene, and it has some important underlying themes - Moose finds this film worthy of a 10.",Awakenings

Until one day the drug fails.This movie will teach you one more time, that what you and I take for granted is actually priceless. That we can take a walk around can be a dream for someone.

114,jaybsigel,"Based on actual occurrences, but the themes have been presented before",7,14 October 2021,"This movie shows us how little we know about the brain. Considering how some technological advances can be used for evil, perhaps that's a good thing.Back in the 1920s, there was a mysterious, worldwide epidemic of encephalitis of presumable viral cause. We still don't know what caused it and it hasn't come back. Encephalitis means inflammation of the brain. Many things can cause it, but it's fortunately uncommon. Depending on what parts of the brain were attacked, it could cause symptoms similar to Parkinson's Disease (PD) with initial tremor (a tremor at rest) and then rigidity. So, the character played by Robin Williams tried an experiment on one of his patients portrayed by Robert De Niro. He gave him L-dopa. In large doses, it could improve some patients with PD. L-dopa has been found to be deficient in the parts of the brain associated with PD. While it does get absorbed when taking it orally, it is metabolized before much of it can get into the brain, so a large dosage was required until the discovery of carbidopa, which prevents the L-dopa from being metabolized and then allows it to get into the brain at much lower dosages. It was first available in 1975 as the drug, Sinemet, manufactured by Merck, and it is available in various combinations of dosages. It remains one of the bedrock drug treatments of PD. But this movie is about 1969, and Sinemet wasn't available. In any event, although better and more effective than L-dopa alone, it still has side effects and PD patients tend to stop responding to it after a while just as the post-encephalitis patients stopped responding to it. Basically, L-dopa isn't a cure for anything, only a temporary treatment for PD.The movie is dramatized history and is very moving in parts. But Robin Williams here just played his usual himself, basically. The patient he tries the L-dopa on in an experiment is portrayed by Robert De Niro. Some patients in the movie had miraculous improvements on the L-dopa, but in all, their illnesses recurred, so it was a disappointment. Some of the issues covered in the movie are difficulties trying new treatments, administrative resistance to new ideas, handling uncomfortable interpersonal relationships and, perhaps, the warning of not messing with mother nature, a frequent theme in many science fiction movies of the 1950s and 60s.The movie reminded me of ""Charly"" (from the book, ""Flowers for Algernon"") where a severely mentally retarded man is the subject of a surgical, brain experiment that makes him into a genius until it wears off and he returns to his previous state. The experiment is first tried on a mouse named Algernon who subsequently dies. Going from mouse to directly to human is quite a jump in species and that would never be allowed now. Charlie Gordon is played by Cliff Robertson (Best Actor Academy Award for this). Charly is clearly science fiction, but similar issues that are covered are also in Awakenings. Here, again, we see the trope of science being bad since both Charly and the patients in Awakenings have only temporary improvements. Still, Charly is a better movie as it shows how the intellectually impaired (the term ""mental retardation"" is no longer ""PC"") were abused and mocked back in the 1960s. And along the same line, see ""The Heart is a Lonely Hunter"" where Alan Arkin portrays a deaf-mute. Both Charly and The Heart... are excellent movies.",Awakenings

I also greatly admire the supporting cast for making this fact based feature that more real for the viewer as each casting and characterisation decision was obviously well thought out.It's a film that takes you in and makes you think about the fragility of life. The writing, pacing, the cinematography and subtle score blend together perfectly allowing the story flow while making the emotional scenes that more impactful.

116,tilloscfc,'Awakenings' Rievewed,4,5 August 2015,"A very very slow movie based on a true story, which is remembered particularly for the outstanding performance of Robert de Niro. How on earth did he not win the 1990/91 Oscar hands down after his portrayal of Leonard Lowe? Every time I watch this movie I have tears in my eyes from the scene where he tells the girl he loves he can't see her again, and watches her leaving from the window until the end. Robin Williams is...well, you know what you're gonna get from Robin Williams - for me the best actor of all time (DeNiro is second, in my opinion the two best actors star in 'Awakenings'.) Robin Williams plays a brilliant, yet incredibly shy and nervous doctor who joins a Psychiatric Hospital in New York where many of the patients are in a coma and dead to the World. Thanks to Dr. Sayer brilliance, a number of the patients including DeNiro 'awaken' from their state - some after decades - for a brief period in the summer of '69. There's a sad scene at the end where Dr. Sachs tells his nurse how Leonard had told him what a kind man he was...only for him to effectively give someone their life back, then take it away again and not be able to do anything about it. That's a sad scene played brilliantly by Robin Williams.

122,filmbay,"A stunning film, must-see for all 9 out of 10",9,21 July 2008,"Director Penny Marshall's Awakenings is being promoted as a ""hurrah for the handicapped"" movie, but it's much more than that. Derived from an account published in 1973 by neurologist Oliver Sacks, this too-strange- not-to-be-true story is magical because it doesn't really try to be - as Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams), the miracle-working character based on Dr. Sacks, says, ""We have to adjust to the realities of miracles."" The realities, as dramatized in Steven Zallian's script, are these: In 1969, Dr. Sayers accepts employment at a chronic-care hospital in the Bronx and is mysteriously drawn to a group of catatonic patients referred to as ""living statues."" Convinced that the patients are cognitively and emotionally alive, despite their external fossilization (some have been immobile for more than 30 years), he investigates their histories. At first, he is stymied by the guesswork diagnoses on record - ""atypical schizophrenia""; ""atypical hysteria"" - and mutters to his nurse (Julie Kavner), ""You'd think at a certain point, all these 'atypical' somethings would amount to a 'typical' something."" They do: Dr. Sayer discovers that the statues have in common an episode of viral encephalitis.The miracle is this: Aware that the experimental compound L-DOPA has proved effective as a treatment for Parkinsonism, a disease Dr. Sayer believes resembles the condition in which his statues find themselves, he proposes using the drug on one of them, Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro), a middle-aged man who began ""disappearing"" into brief episodes of paraylsis at the age of 11 and was permanently hospitalized nine years later, in 1939. When the drug ""awakens"" Leonard, Dr. Sayer asks for permission to prescribe it to the rest of his post-encephalitic patients.At this juncture, Awakenings itself awakens - it sloughs off the ""hurrah for the handicapped"" genre and becomes a movie about the handicap of the human condition in general. Unfortunately, it's impossible to discuss what transpires next without giving the story away, but it can be reported that the subsequent events, for all their atypical specificity, become a blanket metaphor for typical human life (much of which is spent sleepwalking) - it's evident that Dr. Sayer was ""mysteriously"" attracted to the statues because he is one of them.Marshall, director of Big and, in another life, Laverne on Laverne and Shirley, elicits performances from Williams and DeNiro that are exceptional. The former, who can't help being funny, is profoundly serious as the emotionally stunted physician unable to heal himself, and the latter, who can't help being serious, is profoundly funny as the emotionally open patient able to heal his physician. The two strong men are complemented by two stronger women, Kavner as the doctor's sympathetic nurse, and the aged Ruth Nelson (her career began in 1926) as the patient's patient mother. Awakenings is a small, simple movie about a large, complex issue, the waste of human opportunity. It could have been made by Thornton Wilder's Emily, who dies at the end of Our Town and from the cemetery exhorts the living to come fully alive. Benjamin MIller, Filmbay Editor",Awakenings

I'm his fan #1, I've seen and loved almost everything he's done... and this in my opinion is his best performance and the best performance I've ever seen of all... (2nd.- cape fear, 3rd.- raging bull) i mean what a great performance superb I'd say... flawless... i was amazed by seeing that great performance... the way he first improves himself and later the way he gets worst and worst is... you know i don't even have the words to say it... as i already said the best performance ever... obviously the academy didn't give him the Academy Award... but who cares... we all know the Academy sucks...

I found myself lost for words talking about this film because they are just not enough. What i will say is that if you believe 'raging bull', 'godfather 2' or any other other film by deniro are his best performances then BOY WERE YOU WRONG! & i totally resent the statement Kate winslet made in her guest appearance in 'extras' series 1 about disabled peoples portrayal in film getting the actors an Oscar, which this film totally disproves (sadly).'Rain man' can move over, because this truly is a worthy masterpiece that should have really got the Oscar.Deniro always seems to be typecast as a 'tough-guy' or 'wise guy' & this film goes some way to showing that he isn't all about 'that'.This film also shows us that he has one of the best smiles in Hollywood and is just one minuscule element that makes this film so endearing. Robin Williams & Robert Deniro are Hollywood's greatest actors and this may be the only film you'll see them in together, so go out and get this on DVD (its cheap!) Bare in mind that despite the films early slow pace, you'll find yourself never wanting this film to end as you draw closer to its conclusion, Deniro gives the performance of his life & i wish the Oscar film board had a resubmission/review board to correct there past mistakes/injustices so that i could fill them up in a room with this on screen & watch there faces as they walked out after watching it begging for forgiveness for not awarding it the Oscar!",Awakenings

In addition to being a heart warming story (and most of it being true), the performances by both Robert De Niro and Robin Williams are definitely super! For both of them, they were placed in roles that neither of them had done before, nor what they had been known for. De Niro, up to that point in his career, had been in mostly ""tough guy"" roles, and Williams had been in quite a few somewhat comedic roles. But, the two of them played their parts perfectly! And, how De Niro was able to so accurately portray Leonard Lowe's condition was a gem! This movie, and similarly ""Murder In The First"", both definitely deserve WAY more recognition.

140,ryan_boxall,Incredible film - Incredible acting,9,29 March 2020,"Firstly, I am shocked that I had not heard of this film until today, and really only discovered it after searching for Robin Williams movies to fill my time during the current Coronavirus lockdown. When I saw this, featuring Robert De Niro, I knew I had to watch it.What a film it turned out to be.For a film that depicts those with severe disability, it is often the case that seeing fully-abled actors play such a role can be cringe-worthy, if not uncomfortable to watch. However, Robert De Niro provides a performance so fantastic, the story is entirely believable. His frustrations feel honest, his heartbreaking story fresh and real. I have no doubt it was an incredibly difficult role to play, for an actor whom usually provides a 'hard-man' gangster character. However, it is clear that there was absolute conviction and dedication to this role and De Niro deserves full respect.Robin Williams, as always, is fantastic. The magic he provides on screen is inspirational. He himself comes across entirely vulnerable and innocent, a person who wants to help those in the ward, and will go to any lengths to exhaust his efforts.The storyline is deeply moving. Being based on a true story makes this even more heartfelt. It really does pluck at your heartstrings, and both the happy and sad moments in the film feel real.I think it is fair to say, that Robin's own story adds even more to this film. A mis-diagnosis featured in his own life, and an illness which had both physical and psychological effects. To not touch upon it would be a mis-representation of the emotions that simply just seeing a film with Robin Williams in it provides. We have a handful of masterpieces still to enjoy from the incredible actor, and I can honestly say I believe this to be one of them.I think it is important however to also point out that a number of actors and actresses provided some refreshing and joyful moments throughout the film. They may not be household names, but there were some great moments of tenderness and joy from those supporting the main cast; in particular, Julie Kavner, Alice Drummond, Anne Meara and Ruth Nelson among many others.",Awakenings
141,movifan,"Touching, surprisingly well-acted adaptation.",10,26 July 1999,"Here is a film that could have been a disaster if it were not for the work of two very different actors: Robin Williams and Robert De Niro.  Although De Niro is known for powerful dramatic roles, Williams had rarely done drama.  Aside from Oscar-nominated work in ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" (1987) and ""Dead Poets Society"" (1989), his dramatic roles had been limited.In ""Awakenings,"" Williams completely does away with his usual zaniness found even in his previous serious parts.  He is subtle, subdued and in character through-out.  As a doctor with a vision of life for his comatose patients, he creates a likable, shy, determined, three-dimensional portrait.Robert De Niro is also sympathetic and moving as one of the key patients who Williams tries his experimental therapy on.Although the film was nominated for three Academy Awards, including De Niro, the screenplay and the picture itself, Williams was unjustly snubbed.  So was director Penny Marshall, whose confidence in straightforward story-telling and getting superb performances out of her actors, makes this her greatest achievment as a film maker thus far.  It is also one of the best movies of its year.",Awakenings
142,mama-sylvia,Heart-wrenching portrayal of humanity,9,25 February 2006,"I approached this movie differently from most people, because I'm a nurse and I worked with patients receiving experimental chemotherapy. I was absolutely floored at the sensitivity and talent that so accurately presented the desperate clutching at hope, the anger and grief when the response is less than ideal, and even the patient's own concentration on the physician learning from the process. The line about ""get the camera"" was completely true to life. (Nearly every patient I personally explained an experimental protocol to, who signed consent, said something like ""even if it doesn't help me, maybe you'll learn something that will help someone else."") Everyone involved performed superbly. Two comic legends, Robin Williams and Anne Meara, played straight roles with tenderness and a touch of pathos. Steven Zaillian should have won the Oscar he was nominated for for the screenplay. Randy Newman's music set the mood for each scene perfectly. Penny Marshall was robbed, I have no idea why she wasn't even nominated as Best Director.Hollywood does not have a good track record with medical themes, much less mental health themes.

143,clawpack,A Fascinating and Moving Story,10,18 February 2005,"Awakenings is the most emotionally moving film I have ever seen. It delves deeply into one of the worst human fears, losing the ability to move and function, but it's never forced or manipulative, and there's no heavy-handed message or moral. It's just a fascinating story that's beautifully told.The acting is as good as you will ever see. Robert DeNiro deftly handles all the emotional and physical challenges of his role, and Robin Williams demonstrates convincingly that he is an actor, not just a comedian. Williams is perhaps a bit too nerdy at first, but he captures perfectly all the hope, fear, exhilaration, and anguish that a doctor in that situation must be experiencing. Awakenings is based on actual people and events, and, to me at least, real events are always more powerful than even the best fiction.Awakenings had big-name talent and Oscar nominations, but I don't think it ever had a big box office or became a popular video rental. That's a shame. I like escapist fare as much as the next guy, but once in a while, everyone should see a movie that you will remember and think about for a very long time.

I cried during this movie, not just because of the subject matter, but also for the fact that this movie is actually true; and the truth is what makes it so sad. After seeing how these people in this hospital, in the Bronx, who suffered from this terrible disease were only able to ""live"" almost their entire lives' in the brief summer of 1969, I seriously thought about my life and just how fragile it is. When the character Lucy says, ""I know it's not 1926, I just need it to be,"" and how she's living in a 69 year old body, with only the life experience of a 22 year old; my heart just aches. How sad it must be to go into a comatose state at 22 during the Roaring Twenties and wake up at the end of the Age of Aquarius in an elderly body, with no memory of the years in between. I'm so glad this movie was made, and made so well. Bravo Penny Marshall.Robert DeNiro is amazing in this film. Leonard's story is so particularly poignant because he fell under this illness as a child, ""waking up"" at middle age, having never experienced his teens or young adulthood, and more importantly, true love (which he begins to experience through his child-like curiosity with Paula (Penelope Ann Miller-who is also excellent)). This may be a spoiler so beware--but when Leonard has to accept that his ""awakening"" is coming to an end and he has his last dance with Paula, I was in tears. The relationship between Leonard and his mother is also very emotional. She's spent her life taking care of her invalid son, never knowing if he can hear or see her. The way Robert DeNiro portrayed his character's rapid maturity (which he never got to experience in real time), is so superb that he deserved that Oscar nomination 100%. Robin Williams is also outstanding, keeping his usually exuberant sense of humor subdued to play Dr. Malcolm Sayer. You can feel his sense of confusion at trying to get the hospital administration to allow him to try this experimental medication on these patients. It's heartbreaking when he has to finally say goodbye to Leonard, who has a difficult time dealing with the rapid progression of the disease at the end of the summer after the medication is no longer effective. All of the characters in this film were cast perfectly, from Nurse Eleanore to Mrs. Lowe and all of the patients. I would recommend this film to EVERYONE! It captures that lost time period perfectly, and you can actually feel how much these people want to live the lives they were so cruelly cheated out of. If you keep in mind that this really happened in 1969, you'll think about how delicate and immensely important life is.",Awakenings
146,alexjbalbi,One of the best movies ever made!,10,21 May 2019,"Take one part gangster, one part comedian and one part crazy roommate and what do you get? One of my favorite movies of all time! Before she directed A League of Their Own, Penny Marshall directed this heart wrenching tale based on real life events (which I initially didn't realize) that will have you appreciating everything in your life you take for granted.Robin Williams, a comedian with a penchant for improve, takes on his first fully dramatic role. Prior to Awakenings he's done mildly dramatic roles peppered with comedy (Moscow on the Hudson, Good Morning Vietnam) or roles carried by the rest of the cast (Dead Poets Society). Paired with Robert De Niro who was known for several gangster roles and was no stranger to more dramatic roles but never played a role with a condition.How these 3 never won awards for this movie is mind boggling. At a time before the MPAA just handed over Oscar's to anyone playing characters with disabilities, De Niro turns in arguably the best performance of his career. His depiction of Leonard is great and no doubt a testament to the time he and Robin Williams both spent time with actual patients including the last surviving patient treated by Dr. Sacks.Williams turns in his best every straight dramatic performance in his career and one of his best ever. Gotta admit he was the sole reason for Aladdin's success. His ability to give a genuinely human experience gives gravity to Leonard's struggles throughout the movie.Sadly when you mention Williams, De Niro or Marshall people don't immediately think of this movie. However, mention this movie to people who have seen it and watch them light up.",Awakenings
147,khorasanimgn,So touching,10,29 June 2019,"Awakenings is a 1990- American film which is directed by Penny Marshall and stared Robin Williams as Doctor Malcolm Sayer and Robert De Niro as Leonard Lowe, a patient who turned out to be one of a drug's biggest success stories. The movie that is claimed to be based on fact, tells the story of a doctor who discovered beneficial effects of the drug ""L-Dopa"" for catatonic patients and tried to awake them after suffering many years of fossilization and disability to move.Awakenings is a good example of how a stunning movie can be produced without profanity, violence and other common items that are used to make a film catching. The movie is so touching and it can involve the audience since the plot is too magnetic and convincing and the ending remains completely unpredictable. There is no doubt that Williams and De Nior presented one of their best performances and every single movement that they made was totally controlled. The story, irrespective of being a true story, is a marvelous metaphor for all of us that are sleeping in some ways through parts of our lives.However, the movie suffers from some weaknesses and contains some unnecessary scenes. Doctor Malcolm Sayer's character can be mentioned as a good example who was a complex individual that seemed to be scared to death of all mankind and had troubles with making friends. In fact he looked to be scared of all living things and then at the final moments of the movie, he asked the nurse, who was his assistant in the discovery, to go on a date with him. I wonder how these superfluous parts could help to progress the main idea.To sum up, awakenings is the story of two men and their strong will to never give up who have complex and compulsive characters. The film is about being alive, fighting for it, caring and looking for life in other people even when they are disabled and seem to be asleep.",Awakenings

Doctor Sayer begins a diligent study. To the present day, there are still many questions surrounding this strange disease. During one amazing season in the late 60's, a miracle happened. In my opinion, both Robin Williams and Robert Deniro should have won Oscars for this film. I always say that Williams with a beard equals an amazing performance. His role as the meek Dr. Sayer is heartwarming. He plays perfectly off Deniro's character. Robert Deniro is golden as Leonard, the disease afflicted patient that gives all of his consciousness to help Dr. Sayer. With the help of a large dose of medicine and care all the patients and hospital staff have awakenings.One of the most important words spoken in the film is: LEARN.This film teaches me to appreciate life a little more every time I see it.

The story was so sad that after watching I was desperately looking for some funny things to cheer me up, but it's absolutely worth the tears and depression.Robert DeNiro, who was famous from 'the god father', 'taxi driver', and 'dear hunter', played such a different role in this movie. His Leonard caught me right after the beginning. I was happy for his awakening, applauding for his love, concerned by his struggle and eventually crying for losing him once again. The pleasure was too short which made it invaluable. I paid my deepest sympathy to Leonard's mother as I felt the same pain as she did when nobody can save her son. There was a scene when Leonard gradually lost his consciousness and could no longer recognize the woman he loved so much during his awakening, and nothing, absolutely nothing, could get him back. Sitting there seeing him drifting away is heartbroken.Robin Williams surprised me too. He used to give me the impression of a noisy comedian and I didn't quite appreciate his work.

The writer of the movie, Steven Zaillian is a real genius who wrote films such as Schindler's List, The girl with the dragon tattoo, American Gangster. It was nominated for 3 Oscars and won 6 other awards. The two main roles are played by Robert De Niro and Robin Williams. The story ( based on reality) is about: the victims of an encephalitis epidemic c many years ago have been catatonic ever since, but now a new drug offers the prospect of reviving them. In the first part of the movie the doctor ( played by R. Williams) is in the center of the story. He's a little bit antisocial, but really kind and light-hearted, lovable and what's the most important: human. But after about the half of the movie the patient ( played by R. De Niro) wiped the floor with the doctor. The way that De Niro plays is unforgettable and extremely touching, I think the most stone-hearted person would also cried during this movie. There's a love-line in it, but It's not a clichè, like the whole movie is not a typical American blockbuster. The evil's appearance can be a stereotypical part of Hollywood movies, so we expect an evil person, like it could be the severe doctor, played by John Heard.

168,TheSheykhi,Scattered,6,11 September 2017,"had a great Idea and had aptitude to be a great movie but disaster screenplay and directing waste it! The characters were not well-developed at all. it made Inner desire to know the character's past but didn't give us any information. Their illness cured very fast and they got healthy and adapt themselves with conditions even faster! it took a few days for Leonard to be healthy(which is shorter than usual also) but for other patients, just a few hours! worse that script? it's directing. I had seen movie ""big"" by Penny Marshal before and I liked it so much but in this case, she sucked. the film is quite scattered and full of confusion. instead of concentrating on one or two topic, it wants to include several big topic which it isn't easily achievable. I think Marshall should focus on that part of the screenplay that was stronger and leave the weak part. I didn't like De Niro's. in fact he played healthy Leonard part well, but the ill Leonard, Disaster! although Williams was fairly good. Perhaps the script did not allow them to show more than that and director did not provide the base for them. I'm sure you know that a few years later, in the movie ""Good Will Hunting"" by Gus Van Sant, Robin Williams played a similar character and played it Fantastic.Now, you know what's funny?

The story takes you from the peak of hope and happiness, it's when you turn from the state of being the only believer in your idea the only fan of yourself to gaining all in your row, down to the feet of despair and disappointment, it's when nature of human beats you. I watched it once as a doctor, and I laughed when I saw myself in Dr Sayer ,pain reliever ,the straw that patient tries to hang in the deep sea of disease, and I cried when I felt helpless in the war of diseases. And I watched it as a human , and that's it'' the human spirit is more powerful than any drug - and THAT is what needs to be nourished: with work, play, friendship, family.

Several years ago, doing consultative volunteer work in another country, I saw an elderly man who lay immobile and rigid in bed, unable to speak, choking on secretions which he could not swallow and which could not be cleared adequately by suction.  He had pneumonia and was critically ill despite antibiotic and supportive treatment.  He'd been immobile for a long time and his doctor's presumptive diagnosis was some sort of dementia.  I had never seen this condition before, with total body rigidity, but I had seen ""Awakenings"" and my memory of the remarkable portrayal prompted me to suggest to his physician that he give a trial of anti-Parkinson's medication, which he did.The next day I was stunned on entering the patient's room to find him propped up and  smiling alertly.  He said ""Good morning, doctor,"" as I recall, and was able to overcome his pneumonia, able to eat, to converse, and to be helped easily to move.Unfortunately, after about a week or so, as I recall, his locked-in syndrome relapsed despite medication.  However, the movie had helped me to make the proper diagnosis and to bring at least some brief comfort into a desperately ill person's life.DiNiro's portrayal was absolutely outstanding.

171,lucky-51490,Best one I've watched for a long time,10,2 May 2020,"To begin with, I have to say, Robin Williams and Robert De Niro did such a great job portraying their characters. I mean, come on! I do not know much about them and other roles they play, but truly, based on their performances in this movie only, I am swept away. They are just so talented and genuine. Other actors and actresses plays their parts incredibly well, too. They are so convincing and unbelievably charming.The storyline is not exactly surprising or unpredictable, but is attractive enough for me to not want to miss any detail. Throughout the movie, I am always eager to find out what is going to happen next, not just because of Dr Sayer's new discovery, but also because of the stories of the patients and their reactions to things we are already so used to.This movie has everything you look for in a movie: humor, meanings, emotions, etc. Even better, it is based on a true story, which means you are going to be learning as it takes you on its journey. The script is also marvelous in delivering a heavy subject lightly. It does everything but make you pity the patients, which is something many other movies about disability is not able to do. ""Awakenings"" really does those patients justice.I also have to mention that ""Awakenings"" does an amazing job in demonstrating the illness, the aftermath of encephalitis. The mental process of the characters are also very well thought out, moving from happiness to anxiety to even fear, making it so easy for me to connect on a personal level with them. They do not feel like patients to me; they feel like actual people with life stories which everyone would be able to connect with.There are parts which will just crack you up, then there are parts which will leave you in tears; the roller-coaster of emotions this movie takes you on is just crazy; you literally experience feelings on opposite sides of the scale and in between in just about two hours.Besides recreating a factual event, ""Awakenings"" also shows views the powerful relationships between humans. It explores the special friendship Dr Sayer and Leonard Lowe developed, and how heavily it affects him when he failed to help Leonard. Other beautiful relationships were mentioned, too, such as the connections between other doctors and nurses between the rest of the patients, the love of a mother, and the feeling of falling in love for the first time. ""Awakenings"" is a terrific movie and it does a perfect job in proving how much power a good, humane doctor holds. It is truly a beautiful story about the best a human can give..",Awakenings

As there is nothing that's holding me back (except my laziness and other sins), I owe it to myself and God to live with all my might, while I do live.I suppose dying (as one gets older and his physical ability dies slowly long before the last breath) is somewhat like what the patients experienced in this movie. It is a cruel thing, and there is nothing noble about it.A very moving scene: Robert De Niro, as the symptoms (tic) come back and start to gain control over body, fears what is coming and says, ""This is not me!""

They definitely did not disappoint! I am often a fan of movies based on either a book or on a true story; I was in for a treat because this one is both! The film is medically accurate and intriguing without overdramatizing the real-life events. Robin Williams greatly portrays the shy, (clearly) genius, Dr. Sayer. And Robert De Niro does an amazing job of playing a catatonic patient, which I imagine would be amazingly difficult.I enjoyed how the film shows the audience how the medical field operated during the time period. Currently, in most hospitals, most doctors are unceasingly looking for the answers - the whys and the hows. They will not stop until they know why a patient reacts this way or how a patient ended up this way.

I don't know in which world whoever put those tags there lives in, but for me this is more of a horror story. It's an excellent film with excellent actors (although a lot of clichés from the 90s), but the story it tells is terrifying.The story is about chronically ill patients who appear to be completely lost, without any ability to communicate and unable to control their movements. A new doctor notices that the symptoms are similar to Parkinson's disease in some ways, so he tries a new experimental drug which seems to work miracles and bring the patients back to life, fully conscious and in control. Then after a short period the drug stops working and the patients eventually revert back to their catatonic states. In the interval, the patients mention how they were still somewhat aware of what was going on during the decades of apparently being unconscious. Can you imagine something more terrifying than being trapped in your own body, unable to control it or communicate with anyone? I have worked with similar patients and DeNiro does a fantastic job in his portrayal.The movies loses a star for attempting to be feel-good with emotional music and some nonsense at the end which focuses on the doctor, not the patients.",Awakenings

I feel it is his best ""serious"" dramatic performance. And, again Robert DeNiro proves that he can play just about any part and nail it. To be frank, it is casted very well overall.

He was treated by this doctor (Robin Williams), who used a psychoactive drug called L-DOPA during the treatment.

189,kraepelin,A Perfect Pairing,10,11 December 2009,"This is a superb movie. Based on the book by world renowned neurologist Oliver Sacks, it portrays the summer of 1969 at Beth Abraham Hospital in the Bronx, which had become the final resting place for a tragic group of patients whose exposure to the 1917-1928 epidemic of encephalitis lethargica left them hauntingly catatonic. But Dr. Sacks' learned that the newly discovered drug L-Dopa helped patients with certain kinds of Parkinson's disease manage their symptoms. Making a connection between the Parkinson's patients and the catatonic patients in his charge, Dr. Sacks administered L-Dopa to them, resulting in an awakening from their decades-long slumber - hence the title of the film (and the book).In this fictionalized account, Robin Williams plays Dr. Malcom Sayer, a shy, reclusive and socially awkward neurologist newly arrived at a psychiatric hospital. This might well be Williams' finest performance ever - subdued, understated and nearly flawless. His first and most dramatic success in administering L-Dopa involves Leonard Lowe, whose resulting awakening is literally miraculous. And here is where, I believe, the movie approaches the miraculous as well.Robert De Niro's portrayal of Leonard Lowe is the most seamlessly perfect performance I have seen any actor give in any movie. Period. The obvious physical dimension of Leonard's condition might easily have overshadowed his character and turned it into a caricature. Yet De Niro utterly mastered the physical portrayal the the illness in its varying degrees while painting in the most emotionally touching way Leonard's abrupt ascent to wellness and gradual descent back into catatonia. And his depiction of Leonard's awakening to confusing and unfamiliar emotions is as delicate, nuanced and powerful as one could imagine.But the entire cast is remarkable, from Julie Kavner to Ruth Nelson to Penelope Ann Miller and everyone in between. Each character fits perfectly into a mosaic of an astonishingly believable group of patients, professionals and family who shared a miraculous summer of awakening.Quiet, unassuming and powerful, Awakenings is greater than the sum of its parts. As someone who battles a psychiatric illness, I was profoundly touched both by Williams' portrayal of a compassionate, yet doubting doctor and even more so by De Niro's understanding of the poignant tragedy of being trapped in a body and a mind beyond your control.",Awakenings

Face a teary, snotty mess, no chance of falling asleep before watching some Monty Python or anything mindless and funny..The reason I do it is because as crummy as I feel, I truly enjoyed this movie. I get a slight lump in my throat every now and then when movies or TV shows have sad scenes in them, but actual tears are much harder for me to produce. The only other movies I can think of where I've seriously cried have been Spielberg's masterpiece Schindler's list and Bay's not-as-great Armageddon (stop judging me, it's a guilty pleasure!). But lets forget about Armageddon, for the sake of my point.The reason this movie is so touching is because it combines a great plot that's based on true events; likable, yet imperfect (i.e. realistic) characters; pretty good writing and absolutely sublime acting. If Robert De Niro isn't one of the greatest actors in history, I don't know who is. I'm personally not a huge fan of Robin Williams, but even he was really good in this.I'm not going to really say anything about the plot, except that it works, and it is based on a non-fictional book by Oliver Sacks. After a moment of research it has become clear to me that the director has modified the story quite a bit and renamed all the characters. Still, judging by Sacks' website, at least De Niro's character was a real person, as were many of the other characters. The doctor's romantic interest seems to have been 100% fictional, in a Patch Adams sort of way, which is a tad disappointing..(luckily that and Robin Williams seem to be the only noticeable similarities between the two movies)All in all, 9/10, mostly because the story wasn't 100% accurate. Other than that I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie. If you haven't seen it yet, do.

203,noahharlen,This film will break your heart,10,17 July 2018,"Awakenings, based closely on the nonfiction book of the same name by Oliver Sacks, will move, then open, then break your heart. In playing against type, DeNiro and Williams deliver incredibly layered performances as they explore, without being maudlin or sentimental what it means to be human, to be alive, to be a brain in a body. After I saw this movie for the first time I could barely sleep, it nearly triggered a depressive episode but I've actually gone back to it multiple times and read the source material because it's such a fascinating and important, albeit anguishing, story. Awakenings will stay with you, and I can't recommend it enough.",Awakenings
204,ameadows-1,Robin Williams is more than just a comedian,10,4 March 2006,"When you hear that Robin Williams is starring in a movie, you automatically assume it's a comedy. ""Awakenings"" is one of the most touching and memorable movies I've ever seen. Williams gives an extraordinary performance as Dr. Malcolm Sayer. Sayer is a physician who had spent his entire medical career doing research. He feels unprepared and overwhelmed for his new post as staff physician at a psychiatric facility. But he is a caring and sensitive man who is unwilling to let patients in the ""garden"" lead the rest of their lives as unwilling statues. His relentless pursuit of new therapies and drugs aimed at releasing his patients from their bodily prisons will easily leave you in tears. I cry every time I see it...twelve times so far!",Awakenings
205,lbski14,Danica Mckellar: An extra in this movie???,10,26 March 2006,"This movie is absolutely amazing. I first saw it when I was about 11 years old, and I fell in love with it even then. Something that really captivated me was Deniro's performance. I especially was emotionally touched when the mother was upset that Deniro was no longer a catatonic dependent. It was like he was a teenager all over again. The song that she sings to him is priceless, and his sweet demeanor and relationship with her could bring one to tears. Most importantly, Can anyone tell me if Danica Mckellar was an extra in the movie Awakenings? You might remember her as Whinny from the Wonder Years with Fred Savage. Awakenings is one of my favorite movies, and I have seen it several times. In the scene where Williams takes Deniro for an outing to the ocean, the camera scans the crowd to a young girl who looks exactly like Danica. However, IMDb doesn't list Awakenings as one of her films. Can anyone help me out, I'm dying to know!!",Awakenings
206,doc1014,A true gem.,10,27 March 2006,"I saw Awakenings for the third time last night (since 1990). I dropped what I was doing when I saw it was coming on TCM because I've long thought it to be one of the very best films I've ever seen. Now I'm positive it is my favorite...here's why: 1. It's about being alive: caring and looking for life in other people even when they seem asleep. Also it's about the fragility of life both physically and mentally/emotionally. This story, aside from being the true story of the discovery that L-dopa could release people from their apparent demented state, is a marvelous metaphor or allegory for all of us in some ways sleeping through parts of our life. The story may not have been intended as a modern morality tale, but it is even more germaine today than when it took place as science is prolonging life indefinitely. (I've spent a lot of time with critically ill and chronically ill people). More simply, to me it's a beautiful, bittersweet, yet life-affirming movie.2. The casting is perfect! And the performances are out of this world: my favorites by DeNiro and Williams, both of whose bodies of work I greatly admire. Every character is a home run.3. I'm no expert, but the combination of the directing, acting, editing and musical score and the visuals seem perfect to me. (As a musician I particularly appreciate the music).There you have it...I can't understand the lack of acclaim for this movie and Penny Marshall the director. I was surprised that the average rating was below 8 on a site for movie buffs...they must know something I don't about movies... I could understand a ""9"" because the movie lacks a grand ending as far as entertainment goes, but it fits the honesty and grace of the film. SEE THIS FILM.",Awakenings
