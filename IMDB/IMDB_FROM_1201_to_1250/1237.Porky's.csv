0,Leofwine_draca,More than just a teen sex comedy,6,14 March 2011,"The well-remembered PORKY'S was the American Pie of its day, a sequel-spawning popular hit about a group of male students and their encounters with the opposite sex. Seen today, it's a film that hasn't dated too much, which may be due in part to the clever decision to set it in the 1950s (much like GREASE).Obviously, sex and nudity play a part in the film, but it all feels underplayed and no longer shocking, especially in comparison to the latest gross-out humour filling the multiplexes. The jokes are tame and the emphasis isn't on titillation but rather humour stemming from the libidos of the central characters. The surprise is that this is actually an entertaining, well thought out movie with a heart. It addresses coming-of-age issues and it looks at racism, revenge and familial abuse in a matter-of-fact way that many an '80s teen film aspires to. Kudos to director Bob Clark (BLACK Christmas), seemingly at home in any genre.",Porky's
1,SnoopyStyle,"Before American Pie, there was Porky's",8,19 August 2015,"It's 1954 Angel Beach, Florida. Pee Wee Morris is the butt of the jokes. Meat is the muscle bound friend. Tommy Turner and Billy McCarty take the guys for a night out with Cherry Forever. Then they play a prank on them and Pee Wee ends up running home naked. Redneck friend Mickey Jarvis suggests going to Porky's. The boys get embarrassed by Porky and his sheriff brother. Back in school, Tim Cavanaugh picks on Jewish Brian Schwartz. Tim has anger issues from his biker father. Brian defends Tim from his father and they become friends. Billy, Tommy and Pee Wee go to peep on the girls' showers and coach Balbricker catches Tommy by the penis. Coach Brackett finds out why Miss Honeywell is called Lassie. The boys come up with a plan to take revenge on Porky. Finally Pee Wee gets his time with Wendy Williams.There was Animal House in the beginning. Porky's takes it up a notch. Some complain about the denigration of women but one of the best character in the movie is Wendy Williams. If the women are denigrated, Pee Wee is the most ridiculed of them all in the movie. It is rude and crude and a harbinger of things to come. Also it's the friendships that make the movie great. The cast has great fun chemistry together.",Porky's
2,kosmasp,American P...orky,8,24 July 2019,"So yes this existed way before American Pie obviously but you can't help but notice that there were quite a few inspirations taken from this to make one of the best teen comedies ever. Having said that, this isn't too shabby either. On the contrary, this is really well made.It might have caused a lot of controversy when it came out, but it really is good. It is quite dirty and even though the director claims there is no evidence of sexism, I'm sure there are many who would argue differently. And it is not about who is right in that conversations - yes the women are quite empowered in this one and yes there is quite a bit of male nudity way before we get female nudity - still you can't dispute some things and/or what other people are feeling.There is one scene in particular that should make you smile a lot - especially if you are not political correct and quite juvenille. That is really all there is to it - take it for what it is. Nothing more nothing less",Porky's
3,lee_eisenberg,"That'll never be all, folks!",10,10 April 2007,"Bob Clark's untimely death in a car crash a few days ago brings to mind his career, including the hilarious T&A fest ""Porky's"". When I was really young and walked by it at the video store, I always assumed that it had something to do with Porky Pig; it does, if only very loosely. Watching the movie, I could only wonder how much fun they must have had filming it. I almost never stopped laughing, and when I did it was mostly because I ran out of breath from laughter. It's hard to say whether the best scene is the shower scene, or the whole end sequence. It's the sort of movie that you just have to see to believe.OK, so a lot of the movie consists of what are probably male chauvinistic fantasies, but this is a comedy, folks! You're not supposed to take it seriously. But no matter how you interpret it, you gotta love it. Among the cast members is Kim Cattrall, many years before ""Sex and the City"". I liked the sequel equally.In conclusion: Bob Clark, wherever you are, we'll always remember you, if only for this movie and its sequel.Bob Clark directed movies as different as the ""Porky's"" movies, ""Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things"" and ""A Christmas Story"". The things that we see in life...",Porky's
4,jboothmillard,Porky's,5,6 January 2009,"I expected this to be some sort of early American Pie, with teens desperate to lose their virginity, except in a strip bar, slightly more tasteless though, from director Bob Clark (Black Christmas, A Christmas Story, Baby Geniuses). Basically it is 1954, and we are following a group of high school teens going through puberty, and only thing on their minds, sex. We have horny toad Pee Wee (Dan Monahan), bad boy Tommy (Wyatt Knight), tough jock and abnormally ""packaged"" Meat (Tony Ganios), wise-ass redneck without any care Mickey (Roger Wilson), smart Jew Brian Schwartz (Scott Colomby), and racist Tim (Cyril O'Reilly). So they are peaking through holes to the girl's shower room, and making life difficult for teachers and each other, and then they find striptease bar ""Porky's"", only to be thrown out and humiliated soon after entering. They realise they won't get in, so they plan revenge, but they know that owner Porky (Chuck Mitchell), his brother is Sheriff Wallace (Alex Karras), making it difficult, and they also have to forget their differences to work together. Also starring Mark Herrier as Billy, young Sex and the City's Kim Cattrall as Honeywell, Kaki Hunter as Wendy, Nancy Parsons as Ms. Balbricker and Susan Clark as Cherry Forever. The highlights of the film for me are young Cattrall having sex, and her screams echoing in the below basketball court, and after peaking at the girls, one of the guys sticks his penis through one of the holes, and gets it clutched by the teacher. It is quite tasteless, but there is a tiny strange sense of charm about it also, a quite entertaining comedy. Worth watching!",Porky's
5,ccthemovieman-1,A Low Point In Film History,2,6 July 2006,"For a film comedy, this may be one of the all-time sleaziest movies ever made. They just made it under the wire, too, as, by the mid '80s the ultra-sleazy movies like this were history. They lasted from 1970 to about 1984.For 1982, this was ""pushing the envelope."" There is hardly a sentence in this script that isn't dotted with a profane word and all anyone in the film - anyone - cares about is sex. Hey, who isn't in that it some for or another, but this is a mainline film and that's all that mattered in here. Even more ludicrous and insulting is that it's about high school-age kids (who all look about 25 years old in this film)!When you are young, stupid and devoid of morals, this is a ""cool"" movie. I thought it was 25 years ago when I first saw it, to be perfectly honest. Yes, even that classic scene in the shower room with the bulldog gym teaching pulling on this guy was funny...but not now. This film looks sophomoric to me now that it's embarrassing. I guess it depends on when in life you watch it. Anybody over 40 who still watches this needs counseling. This movie should be put in a time capsule to show how low Hollywood had plummeted by 1982.",Porky's
6,Tweekums,Puerile but funny '80s comedy,7,7 January 2019,"This classic '80s comedy is set in a South Florida high school in the 1950s. It is centred on a group of boys who are desperate to get with the girls. After failing locally one of them suggests they go to Porky's, an establishment deep in the Everglades in the neighbouring county. The know Porky has a reputation but head there anyway... for their troubles he relieves them of a hundred dollars before dumping them in the swamp. Most of them vow very to return but one of them is determined to get his revenge... with painful consequences. Back at school the boys plan to peek at the girls as they shower and a young male sports coach tries to find out why an attractive female coach is nicknamed 'Lassie'.If you don't like puerile humour then you'd best avoid this as it contains numerous gags about sex and genitalia. There is also a moderate amount of nudity, both male and female and the characters aren't particularly likeable... at least the antagonist is even less likeable. There are plenty of funny moments, some very funny as well as some awkwardness as characters uses racist language, even if it is clear other characters disapprove. The cast are okay, even if they are clearly much older than the characters they play in most cases. Overall I wouldn't say this is a must see but if you don't mind the style of humour it is pretty funny.",Porky's
7,BA_Harrison,"Too puerile, even for me.",5,1 January 2016,"A group of horny high-school pals visit Porky's, a redneck bar in the Everglades, where they have heard that they can pay to get laid. After they are ripped-off by the bar's obese owner and his brother, a corrupt sheriff, the friends decide to take revenge.Porky's was one of the first American teenage sex comedies to be a major hit at the box office, but I find its success rather perplexing. As a coming-of-age story, I think the film works well enough: the nostalgic setting and strong sense of camaraderie is certainly appealing, while the bitter feud between the teens and the Everglades rednecks, and a subplot that deals realistically with the issues of racism and family violence adds drama to proceedings. I do, however, find the film's raunchy antics nowhere near as funny as its characters, and director Bob Clark, obviously think they are.The 'Mike Hunt' telephone gag which has the teens in stitches isn't that hilarious, or original, having been conceived in the mid '70s by pranksters John Elmo and Jim Davidson; the repeated jokes about penises soon become very tedious; and as much as I enjoy seeing a young Kim Cattrall without her kecks on, her 'Lassie' scene is embarrassingly bad and far too drawn out. Clark seems to think that if his characters roll around in uncontrollable fits of hysterics for long enough, it'll eventually have the audience laughing along with them. Not in my case I just found it irritating.",Porky's
8,moonspinner55,Mindless sex comedy,2,17 December 2006,"A year before directing the cult yuletide comedy ""A Christmas Story"", Bob Clark wrote and directed this marginally seamy romp involving horny 1950's high school boys in Florida who are eager to score, running afoul of a nefarious roadhouse owner and his sheriff-brother. Clark shows lots of enthusiasm but no ingenuity, and the hammy, obnoxious cast continually chortles at their own unfunny antics. Clark's script, full of names like Pee Wee and Cherry Forever, curiously seems stuck in a nostalgic time-warp (it's like a dirty ""Happy Days""). The picture is leering and lascivious, and yet harmless enough to attract youngsters. A big hit in its day (never underestimate the power of comedic sleaze), it was followed by sequels in 1983 and 1985. *1/2 from ****",Porky's
9,BandSAboutMovies,So many movies start here,6,10 June 2021,"Bob Clark wrote and directed this film - the adventures of the students of Florida's Angel Beach High School in 1954 - that ended up inspiring an entire generation of movies much in the same way that Animal House inspired it. Clark based the movie on his own experiences growing up.At one point, every studio in Hollywood turned down Porky's. Clark got the movie produced through Melvin Simon Productions and a Canadian firm, Astro Bellevue Pathe, making the film up north to take advantage of tax benefits. So yeah. This is yet another Canadian tax shelter film.Much like, well, every teen sex comedy that would follow this, the boys all want to lose their virginity. They go to Porky's, a strip club in the swamp, thinking they can hire a girl there, but they're all dumped into the Everglades by the club's owner, Porky. They demand their money back, but Porky's brother is the sheriff, which means that they lose even more cash.The movie revolves around getting back at Porky and also getting into the pants of the ladies, including Lynn ""Lassie"" Honeywell (Kim Cattrall). In 1954 and 1981, this was a common part of growing up. Today's viewers may not see the film in such a comedic light, but you can't expect things made forty years ago to understand the progress that has happened since they were made. The fact that you recognize that these movies are outdated points to how much progress we have made; enjoy them for the parts that you can enjoy them for.The real Porky's - Porky's Hide Away in Oakland Park - is now an L. A. Fitness. That makes me incredibly depressed.",Porky's
10,Coventry,Everyone's favorite guilty pleasure!,7,16 May 2009,"I've never met anyone in my life who didn't love ""Porky's"" (in real life, that is, because on the Internet you always encounter people with different opinions) and that is probably just because this is an irresistibly energetic and out-and-out funny 80's teen comedy! The essence of juvenile & vulgar comedies lies here within this film, and arguably also ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and ""Animal House"", but definitely not in the lame and uninspired nowadays flicks such as ""American Pie"". All the classic gags and politically incorrect jests are here: small penis jokes, big penis jokes, sticking penises in usual things, voyeurism through minuscule peepholes, the eternal virgin nerd, loud-screaming girls, redneck humor and much more. If you ever wondered where Bart Simpson found the inspiration for his prank calls, well that's probably because he watched ""Porky's"" as well! This is the simplistic tale of a bunch of teenage friends, all of them with incontrollable raging hormones, attending high school in the 1950's. In their never ending journey to get laid, they battle against all types of annoying authorities (read: adults) like gym coaches, parents, police officers and obnoxious nightclub owners. Particularly this last group forms a severe obstacle, as the boys are desperately trying to get into a strip club in a neighboring county but the owner – a fat and sleazy hillbilly nicknamed Porky – and his gang of local yokels get a kick out of humiliating and beating up juvenile visitors. In between all their hectic adventures at school, the group plots the ultimate act of vengeance against Porky and his whole county of hillbilly freaks. Personally I don't understand how you could NOT enjoy a movie like ""Porky's"", as it is so stimulating, cheerful and harmlessly infantile. The main characters are delightfully stereotypical high school bastards (especially the unforgettable Pee Wee) and some of the situations they find themselves stuck in are indescribably hilarious. A few of the highlights include an outrageous sex sequence with future ""Sex and the City"" starlet Kim Cattrall and the legendary coach Balbricker's quest to have one of the boys suspended for obscenities in the girls' shower. Needless to say ""Porky's"" is a sex comedy chock-full of gratuitous T & A (and enough wool to knit a sweater with) and crude insinuations, but if this movie is too offensive for you already, you better sing up in a convent straight away. This was the biggest box office hit for the versatile writer/director Bob Clark, who directed pleasant comedies like this as well as creepy horror movies like ""Black Christmas"" and ""Dead of Night"". He sadly died in a dramatic car accident in 2007. Thanks to films like ""Porky's"", he at least leaves behind a spirited heritage! Rest in peace, Mr. Clark.",Porky's
11,bevo-13678,Sexy,10,14 March 2021,Well crafted movie with an intense story line and snappy dialogue. Could have done with some more fart jokes,Porky's
12,jotix100,Growing pains,5,12 September 2010,"The years of the last Eisenhower administration loom large in this story about a group of teenagers in high school that, at the time it was released, caused quite a stir by its irreverent dialogue and situations not shown in a typical film directed to that age group. The students from Angel Beach, Florida, were addicted to sex in whatever way they could get it. They get inventive in ways that some of their contemporaries never thought possible.On second viewing, Bob Clark's 1982 ""Porky's"", still packs a punch in the way the people depicted went about their salad days getting into all kinds of problems. The frank talk in the film will turn off, and may be offensive to a lot of viewers. Mr. Clark captures the mentality of the times vividly, right down to the way most of these kids viewed their lives, and that of others.Nancy Parsons made a mean coach Balbricker. Kim Cattrall, who went to bigger and better things, and Kaki Hunter, one of the trashiest teens ever seen on a film, are good. Dan Monahan, Scott Colomby, Susan Clark, Alex Karras, and the rest of the large cast do fine work for Bob Clark.",Porky's
13,Scarecrow-88,Porky's,10,12 December 2009,"""I've never seen such wool, you could knit a sweater.""In the 50's, high school kids just want to get laid and have an awful hard time doing so.It's amazing that one film can almost completely focus on getting laid, but Porky's does so, and is successful at it. The jokes are almost entirely based solely on sex. Such gags as ""Cherry Forever"", ""Mike Hunt"", ""Lassie""(..Miss Honeywell's ""response"" to the smell of a boy's locker room), Ms. Balbricker's request for a ""mole inspection""(..after letting something ""slip through her fingers"")and the principal's response to such a scenario(""tallywacker""), all contribute to the crude hilarity that is Porky's. While tame compared to even PG-13 comedies today, Porky's is certain to offend some with it's naughty humor. And, before there was Meg Ryan's fake orgasm in When Harry Met Sally, there was Ms. Honeywell(Kim Cattrall, who would've had to have been a major wet dream for many teenagers at that time, I imagine, was a fox!)announcing to the whole gym what a real one sounds like! And, Dan Monahan's Pee Wee is a priceless character, finally getting his ""cherry popped"" at the end, securing a neverending pursuit of satisfying a lengthly quest. Good support by Art Hindle as a police officer whose younger brother, Mickey(Roger Wilson)wouldn't halt waging war against Porky(..the massive Chuck Mitchell). Interesting enough, Susan Clark(..as Cherry Forever)and Alex Karras(..as Sheriff Wallace, Porky's brother)both would later star as husband and wife on the popular sitcom Webster. The cast work incredibly well together and share a camaraderie that's actually quite poignant, even though their topic of choice is chicks(..my kind of guys).The drama aspects are also here. One of the group of horny males is a kid named Ted whose abusive father just got released from serving time for homicide. There's an emphasis on accepting a Jewish student who, for a time, was frowned upon, but is actually a hospitable guy. But, the core is a large repulsive strip bar owner in the next county from where most of the film is set, named Porky whose equally repellent brother is the sheriff. The boys attempt to pay for sex from some of his girls, get tricked and humiliated, and seek revenge against him for their mistreatment. So there are alternating story lines which accompany the main point of the students seeking sexual fulfillment so they can no longer dream of ""what it's like.""The grand finale, when the gang put together a plan to get Porky back for putting their stubborn friend in the hospital because he wouldn't quit returning to the bar to get revenge, adds the exclamation point, even though we're asked to believe they could get away with it just through crossing over into another county.",Porky's
14,preppy-3,Repulsive and unfunny,2,14 December 2001,"I saw this movie back in 1981 and was appalled. I thought it was sick and found the constant emphasis on sexual humiliation kind of sad. Twenty years later I still hate it.It deals with the stupid, smutty adventures of a group of Florida teenagers in 1954. All the jokes deal with sex and are unfunny; all the ""teenagers"" are obviously in their 20s (one guy was almost 30!); the girls and guys are equally ugly; nobody can act (although Nancy Parsons has a few moments) and, by today's standards, this is kind of dull. This was considered extreme in 1981 but, for better or worse, we've gone beyond it. For some reason this was a HUGE hit and led to 2 sequels. I have nothing against sex humor, but people are constantly being humiliated in this movie--it gets uncomfortable to watch.I am giving the film a 2 because there are two very funny sequences in it--an ""encounter"" between Boyd Gaines and a very young Kim Cattrall who is very ""vocal"" and when the gym girls teacher wants a very--um--""private"" exam of all the guys in the school. Those are funny and the film has extensive female AND male nudity! Still, that's hardly a recommendation.It's hard to believe director Bob Clark did this. He's made some great films (""Murder by Decree"", ""Black Christmas"", ""A Christmas Story"", ""Deathdream""). Why did he do THIS?",Porky's
15,Bunuel1976,"PORKY'S (Bob Clark, 1982) **1/2",6,18 April 2007,"I watched this and its first sequel in tribute to director Clark's recent tragic demise; I recall it being shown on Italian TV as a kid, but I was never all that interested in checking it out - since I'm not a fan of teen flicks and, basically, I had always felt that Clark debased himself somewhat by choosing to make such films in the first place... Now that I've had the opportunity to watch the film for myself, I found it a surprisingly tolerable if uneven comedy - and occasionally uproarious; thankfully, the teenagers here aren't as obnoxious as in other films of its ilk. It also takes care to provide mild social commentary by having its characters stand up for a put-upon member of the Jewish community.Though some gags eventually grow repetitive or outstay their welcome, its best moments are the following: the scene with the prostitute played by Susan Clark, the numerous clashes with the obese female teacher (especially the shower scene and its aftermath in the headmaster's office) and the climactic demolition of Porky's red-neck establishment.",Porky's
16,utgard14,"""Has anybody seen Mike Hunt?""",5,18 June 2014,"Raunchy '80s sex comedy that takes place in the '50s. So yeah, it's mostly lame but it was a lot funnier back then. Of course I was a stupid tadpole then so sex jokes and stuff were titillating and new to me. Truthfully, very few of these types of movies age well. This is probably one of the better ones, for what that's worth. There are some laughs to be had, as well as a valuable lesson about anti-Semitism that I'm sure changed the minds of many bigots. Sexy young Kim Cattrall is a plus. The parents from ""Webster"" are here as a corrupt sheriff and a hooker. Classic car enthusiasts and (male) children of the '80s will probably get more out of it.

18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,An unimpressive entry in a genre that is plagued by lack of quality,5,30 December 2005,"The raunchy teen comedy... one of the few genres where good film-making is such a rarity, you would wonder if it exists within it at all. I've seen my share of these films, most of them when I was younger and the tone appealed to me... but once you get over the age of 18, it's hard to look back and not consider them juvenile and tacky. There are a few fairly good films in the genre... the first example that springs to mind is American Pie, or my personal favorite, Road Trip. This, however, is not one of the good films... it's actually not awfully good at all. The humor is crude and pretty poor. The plot is dull and progresses so slowly, it will lull almost anyone to sleep. Anyone who doesn't laugh like crazy at the constant utterances of obscenities and references to sex, of course. The acting is mostly overplayed, as is the humor; gags and jokes are poorly set up and forced. The characters are poorly written and barely developed at all; I honestly can't tell the group of friends that make up the main characters apart. There is little to no comedic value, all the humor is based on being crude and/or seeing someone in embarrassing situations. That's not humor, that's being provocative and serving the inner jerk in the audience(ever hear of ""schadenfreude""?). This just isn't a good film, period. Lazily made, plot barely coherent and nothing memorable neither as far as scenes nor as dialog go. One to avoid, unless you are an avid(or should I say rabid?) fan of the genre and you simply *have* to see every film of this kind. How this has risen to be one of the most popular and well-known of the genre is beyond me. 5/10",Porky's
19,neil-476,Surprisingly important,6,1 June 2010,"Porky's really isn't a very good film, if one is to be brutally honest.But it is an important film because it created a template for horny teen high school comedies which has been followed by many movies since.If it wasn't for Porky's, there would be no American Pie, which IS a good film (I'm not talking about the sequels or the other films which carry the American Pie brand).And Porky's itself has some pleasing elements - the 1950s setting rings true, and there are decent performances from Dan Monahan and Kaki Hunter, not to mention an entry for Kim Cattrall (by which I mean an entry into her movie career, what did you think I meant?).",Porky's
20,Uriah43,Teenage Sexual Frustration in the 50's,6,22 October 2018,"Set in the 1950's this film follows several students at Angel Beach High School in Florida as they go about trying to score with local females any way they can. Naturally, being high school students they don't have a great deal of sexual experience or maturity and it shows day in and day out. To remedy their sexual frustration they content themselves with playing jokes on one another and sometimes the female students as well. In particular, one high school boy named ""Pee Wee"" (Dan Monahan) loves to play pranks on a female student by the name of ""Wendy"" (Kaki Hunter). But Wendy knows a thing or two and often comes up with a few pranks on her own. But the real challenge for the boys is getting into a nightclub about 70 miles away called ""Porky's"" where women are available-for the right price. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that ""high school comedies"" of this type were quite popular during the 80's and this particular film did very well at the box office. That being said, it should also be mentioned that this movie has more than it's fair share of crude humor and scenes of a sexual nature. Likewise, although it is supposed to depict high school life in the 50's, there was very little of it actually displayed here other than the scenes involving Southern bigotry that exists even to this day. Yet, despite these criticisms I still enjoyed this film to a certain extent and because of that I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Porky's
21,morrison-dylan-fan,Gonna pork.,5,14 May 2020,"Over a year ago I tried to watch the Arrow Blu, but my PS3 suddenly paused and stopped playing it. Turning it off/on,the console beeped a few times then stopped working! Having since got a replacement PS3,and a Comedy viewing challenge taking place on ICM,I finally went to get some pork.View on the film:Put together over 15 years from a composite of incidents either he or his friends experienced, the screenplay by writer/director Bob Clark keeps the ragtag origins visible, with the shift from the guys getting on the wrong side of Porky, to the lads eyeing ladies in the shower, coming across as disconnected from each other, due to the pick up and drop state is in when focus moves to the other one.Whilst going for gags of the guys failing to get lucky, the most successful jokes are ones where Clark brings heart to the teen Comedy genre, reaching a peak in the mad-cap dash final of the students getting their own back at Porky.Becoming a unexpected smash hit, director Bob Clark reunites with regular cinematographer Reginald H. Morris offering a teasing level of skin for the teen crowd, mixed with mildly gross-out Comedy that keeps the centre-piece shower scene still standing proud. Highlighted in Arrow's very good transfer, Bob Clark places the gross out jokes in a sweet 50's setting, where grainy bright red beams over the guys getting up to drunken mischief, and teaming up to get revenge on Porky.",Porky's

It's too unpleasantly sleazy with corny sex-related jokes and the sexually ""liberated"" tone doesn't fit the mid-50s. I can't believe Susan Clark lowered herself to play the prostitute Cherry Forever; likewise, Kim Cattrall gets stuck with a (supposedly funny) humiliating scene. Furthermore, the young actors are clearly in the 24-30 range, not high schoolers. It would've made more sense to make this about college juniors/seniors.But there are some good parts, like the 50's southeast Florida setting, the coming-of-age element, a few attractive females and an honest attempt to flesh out these youths with conflicts and so forth.Unfortunately, the raunchiness leaves the viewer feeling dirty. For a much more palatable movie of this ilk check out the excellent ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" which came out five months later.The movie runs 1 hour, 34 minutes, and was shot entirely in southeast Florida (Miami, Miami Beach, North Miami, North Miami Beach, Hollywood, Fort Lauderdale and North Bay Village).GRADE: C/C-",Porky's
24,mm-39,Tame for today's standards.,6,2 January 2015,"I remember in junior high the shock and excitement about Porky's! The forbidden pleasure concept is out of date. With internet porn, cable, every other sex comedy trying to out do the other with toilet humor Porky's is tame and or lame by today's standards. The nudity and pranks/stunts are used in mainstream comedy. (ie The Hang Over) Even a few of the concepts would never be used with today's 24 7 cable news, with sexual predators, hazing incidents etc. Anyone peeking in the girls showers in today's environment would be a candidate for intense counseling. The male bonding, and pranks of the 1980's are of a gone by era, where a hand shake after a fist fight was common. I like the music, and had a few cheap laughs from Porky's which was low story line. The story-line of messing with Porky got across as lame for anyone who remembers the, sinister, Harlan DeGroat character from Out of the Furnace movie. Overall six Porky's out of ten.",Porky's
25,Mr-Fusion,Maybe I watched it at the wrong age,4,16 August 2015,"""Porky's"" isn't at all what I was expecting, and that's the real disappointment. Part of the reason is that it's Bob Clark, and that movie's not nearly as funny as ""A Christmas Story"". Along with that, the VHS box (saw it a lot as a kid) left me to believe there'd be a lot more nudity than there really is (a surprising deficiency). For a horny teen comedy, there have to at least be some hot chicks, right? All we get is a shower scene full of breasts. One scene. Seriously? It does have Kim Cattrall, but she's criminally underused, even at that point in her career. But what's the point of aiming at the sex-crazed teen crowd if you're running short on tits? At least supplement it with decent comedy.4/10",Porky's
26,Smells_Like_Cheese,"At times extremely annoying, but at times actually pretty funny",4,27 August 2007,"My boyfriend and I were at a DVD store the other day and he saw the big special edition of ""Porky's"" and was like ""I loved this movie so much, isn't it so funny?"" and I just looked at him and was like ""Ummm, I never saw it"" and he just looked at me like my hair fell out. He said this was such a classic and that I shouldn't call myself a movie buff if I hadn't seen this film. So I took his advice, I rented it, and watched it this morning. I know he's gonna hate me because to be honest, I didn't really find it that funny. It just seemed like a typical teen sex comedy that was more gross and unrealistic than actual comedy. But I admit that I did have a couple of laughs here and there, the story wasn't really that bad.Basically a bunch of boys in high school are determined to get laid. Some have been laid before, but there is a guy they call Pee-Wee, understandably by his lack of a package, they take him to a strip joint called Porky's. There they give the owner, Porky, a hundred dollars to have the strippers for an hour, but Porky tricks the boys and ends up humiliating them instead. So throughout the movie one of the boys keeps going back to get revenge and finally they all just do it together for the ultimate revenge tactic.Porky's did have a few funny scenes, like the ""love"" scene between the coach and Honeywell, played by a very young Kim Catrell, her screaming was so hilarious. Then the female gym teacher going after the boys because they were teasing the girls in the locker room through the peep holes, she was pretty funny. Over all, I wouldn't say that Porky's is at all a bad film, it has it's moments here and there, but I'd rather stick with other teen sex comedies, but this one is worth a look if you're into them.4/10",Porky's

But this Bob Clark movie isn't American at all, it's an Canadian film, so Porky's can be classed as one of the highest-grossing Canadian film of all time in Canada's domestic box office, with over the total of $111Million CDN. Set in the 1950's, the film charts the usual round of high school jerks who's sole purpose in life is getting laid with seems more trouble than it's worth. There was just something smug and smarmy about their attempts to have sex that makes you wish that they get what deserves for their pre-adolescent actions. The actors don't even look like they belong in high school nor does they look like they should be allow to be on school grounds with such stalking and pervert like actions. If this was a real life, their actions would have leaded to criminal convictions and require them to register as sex offenders for the rest of their lives. I don't like films that glorifies their actions. The adults in this film are not better. For somebody running a school in high school in Eisenhower Conservatism America, their principal makes light of the boys actions. To make matters worse, the two male gym teacher are not making it any easier by snickering to themselves. It is simply a teen exploitation film put together by a bunch of adults with actors in their early twenties pretending to be high school kids and adults being children. It's hard to sympathize with them with all the unappealingly misogynistic and vile. You want them to get hurt by the end. It doesn't matter, if it's the girl's school shower room antics, where one of the gang actually gets a lot more than he bargained for or Porky's nightclub who humiliates the kids and steal their money. This movie is so raunchy, but it's less about sex, but more about revenge against the people that does them, wrong. Most of the movie is trying to get revenge against Porky's nightclub. There is a sub plot saying that people of different religions and beliefs need to more understanding. Wow, that's seems out of place. Was this thrown in to make it socially relevant? It's doesn't help the movie when its show cast more nudity, than social tolerance. There is a lot of nudity, both male and female. Sadly sex sells, even if the jokes are awful. The T&A doesn't titillate as much now as it did then, but you can still imagine teen boys laughing hysterically the first time they watch it. It's not what one would call a deep or engrossing movie though. It lacks the complexity and genius of an Animal House or American Graffiti. Both based on 1950's teenager sex-life. The movie has two familiar characters that audience will remember most, which are Edward ""Pee Wee"" Morris (Dan Monahan) who is the funniest of the group, despite being a one dimension character. Pee Wee is so named because of his little man part, and inability to score. Another would be Coach Beulah Balbricker (Nancy Parsons) who borderline cartoony with her butch female coach look. Another note character would be Kim Cattrall as Miss Honeywell. Miss Honeywell earns her legendary nickname of Lassie, the description of the wanted poster for the male private part. Don't get me wrong, I have an sense of humor, but overall, this film a sexist and primitive film, whom never either condones or rejects their behavior. I just can't watch this film any more than once. Unfortunately it spawned 2 bad sequels as well. Not worth it, in my watch list.",Porky's

I had to see what was so funny. The next week I went to see ""Porky's"". It was a big disappointment. I used to watch this movie a lot on cable but I don't remember laughing much. I just wanted to see the shower scene. Today was the first time I've seen this movie in many moons. It's really bad. There's a lot less nudity than I remembered and only a couple of laughs. You know you're in trouble when the characters in the movie laugh at all of the jokes. It's like a built-in laugh track. Warts and all, I've always had a soft spot for writer/director Bob Clark.

32,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Porky's"" is as reckless as its characters and as memorable as its best scenes",7,28 May 2009,"""Porky's"" is the ultimate teenage fantasy, a movie celebrating group mentality shenanigans, everything from obsessing about sex to pulling the ultimate prank on that one old guy always bringing you down. It's a film that says that at heart, we're all good-natured kids that wish we could be irresponsible every so often.This is ""Porky's"" only point, both its hindrance and most celebrated characteristic. There isn't any character development or a through plot line -- going to the strip club Porky's is only representative of two major scenes in the movie. It's about high school kids horsing around and trying to get laid in Florida in the '50s. There are some admirable but pointless subplots fixed on anti-Semitism and parent abuse, but it's just about laughs.What makes ""Porky's"" unique is that it's about laughter, it's not just about creating it for the sake of being a comedy film. A stand-out scene is when the strict oafish gym teacher Ms.Ballbricker is explaining to the principal her plan to identify a trouble-making student by lining up several of the boys to examine their manhood. In the background, two of the students are dying from laughter and even the principal at one point can't hold it in any longer -- then a nice close-up of a portrait of President Eisenhower with a big grin on his face. That sums up ""Porky's"" nicely: we all need to laugh at the ridiculousness and humor of certain situations. If only the film spent a bit more time hammering that in instead of meandering about like a bored high schooler.This is a film you can watch over and over again, not only because it can be funny for all appropriate ages, but it only thrives from scene to scene. The entire high school-aged fantasy of boys getting spy on the girls' showers owes its birth to this film, the hilarity as the new gym coach learns why the attractive young girls' coach is nicknamed ""Lassie,"" and of course that ultimate revenge against the powers that be, in this case Porky and his redneck sheriff brother, who try and stop kids from having fun. It can be watched one scene at a time -- there's nothing gluing it all together.Bob Clark's film has a carefree and reckless attitude that resembles that of his characters, but as admirable as that is -- and a rare find in a movie indeed, especially comedy -- there's no doubt that ""Porky's"" avoids being the kind of coming-of-age film it could have been. There's no substitute for memorable characters in addition to unforgettable scenes, but ""Porky's"" viewers can at least relish the latter.",Porky's

The burly black guy was about to blow the whole thing, with his snickering and he later does his part with the machete at the horny little dogs.

But some of the scenes, say, the shower scene for instance, are all-time comedy classics. Now, I wasn't around in high school in the 1950's (70's for me) but it seems that most of the characters behaved like '70's people instead of '50's people.

37,jimbo-53-186511,The first half is really bad and things don't improve that much in the second half,3,10 October 2015,"The first American Pie film and its subsequent sequels were the 'gross out' teen films of my generation and I have gone on to enjoy all of the main American Pie films (except the direct to DVD offerings which were all beyond awful). I was therefore surprised how much I disliked Porky's (considering the fact that the central idea from American Pie has been lifted from Porky's - the only difference is that in American Pie they make a pact to lose their virginity before Prom night). I think what made the Pie films better was that the writers seemed to make more of an effort to develop the main characters and I think for that reason it made it easier to identify with them.In Porky's rather than giving us characters we can identify with or relate to the writers give us characters that, at best we are unable to connect with, and at worst are going to end up hating. Many of the jokes in the film are crass without being funny and much of the dialogue is clumsy, irritating and unfunny. The writing is also very uneven whereby it starts out as a bunch of high school kids wanting to lose their virginity and then that concept is all but abandoned in place of gaining revenge against ol Porky himself. I can perhaps understand the change of tone as I was losing interest in their quest as well so perhaps the writers did too. This shift in tone admittedly makes the second half of the film slightly better than the first half, but it's still pretty weak - although I did find the final act quite amusing even though I could see it coming a mile off. Some people may condemn a film like Porky's for its lack of subtlety, but I think that's probably a little unfair (that's a bit like criticising a porn film for having poor acting or a lack of plot). The sign for Porky's that we see at the start is beyond suggestive, but to me much of the humour felt a little forced rather than feeling natural. The performances from the cast are variable - none of the male leads are that good and are rather forgettable. Kim Cattrall isn't given much to do in the first half, but she does have one memorable scene in the second half (she looks good here too). Nancy Parsons is the scene stealer in this film as the feisty PE Teacher who's aptly named Balbricker.Ending on a positive note there were a couple of scenes that I did enjoy; the shower scene with Balbricker was funny as was the aftermath of the event. The prank call to the diner was quite funny as well even though I'd heard the joke before. Porky's is more than likely where the creators of The Simpsons got their idea from with Bart's prank calls to Moe. All in all Porky's isn't completely terrible, but there are nowhere near enough laughs to warrant the running time. I can (and have) watched The American Pie films (particularly the first 3 films) over and over again, but I can safely say that watching Porky's once was more than enough for me.",Porky's

I absolutely hated the characters in this movie, especially the main guy that is trying to lose his virginity. The amount of nudity and just disgustingly sexual scenes in this movie is almost shocking. For example, the shower scene where a teenage boy sticks his **** through a hole in the girls shower room, and the big female teacher comes and just grabs it! Eww! That wasn't even funny, it was just gross! That is what porky's suffers from, it's just not funny, it's just a bunch of horny teens doing nasty things and trying to outwit some sleazy night club owner. It's boring, dull, and poorly written.

Even though I am not a fan of this movie, I give director Bob Clark some props as a diverse film maker. He has worked on a wide range of films from Black Christmas to A Christmas Story. A Christmas Story works much better as a period piece of the 50's and is a much better film as well. However, the two pictures are much different and that is where their similarities begin and end. Unlike many other movies that people consider to be classics, I don't think the movie aged well. Porky's as a movie is not that spectacular and while the acting performances are not bad, they are not great and do not elevate this substandard film.

Surprise box office hit stars Roger Wilson, Kim Cattrall, Scott Colomby, Dan Monahan. The film is based in Florida in the year 1954, and evolves around a group of high school students. Tommy, Edward, Mickey, Billy, Tim, and Anthony, come to believe (through their quest to lose their virginity) that they can hook up with a prostitute at Porky's which is a notorious bar. Things don't go as planned and after Porky takes their money and throws them out into the swamp, the group decide to get even with Porky and his brother the Sheriff through any means possible, while also continuing with their usual chaotic causing routines in school.The true strength of this film is the hilarity. The kids make it funny because they always look like they are having fun. When one person is taking their licks, the other five that are in on the gag are laughing under their breaths and all you get is a snicker or two. And we can all relate to that. How, something is funny but we have to play our part to keep the charade going. These kids do that with perfection here. I also have to mention some of the scenes that make this film the teen classic that it is. The first is the scene when Mr. Carter, their principal is being pressured by Ms. Balbricker to find the guy who had his penis hanging out of a drain pipe in the girls shower. Mr. Carter is doing his best to keep a straight face but he is going to crack at the absurdity of the request.

Yes, the Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley, Hee-Haw Honeys etc., TV shows to throw folks back to a time that was homey, fun and allegedly moral.Then came a movie that too was aimed at my generation that dispelled all that ""goodness it was so great and moral and no one talked about or had premarital sex back then.."" and that was ""Animal House"". At that point, I looked at my parents and thought, ""Oh, you did go to College and did more than go to class, and went back to your dorms and play tiddly-winks until next class. You too had nasty malcontents, behind-kissers, stoners, alcoholics, F-students...and, and...!!!""The idea of a ""simpler-time in the past"" where everyone was wonderful and obedient and didn't get to third-base -- was wrong. In that same manner, after Animal House, 4 years later came this film, Porkys. The trailers to Porky's were awful, but my friends and I went because their friends saw the film and said we have to see it. So I went with my friends and saw it.The film is set in the early 50's about, teen males in High School. Their hormones were raging. They had one thing on their minds, and somehow studies fit in there (they weren't boys who didn't like education studies, they liked it fine) but they were...teen boys too. Human. And they were obsessed about a place they heard about, that they had to get into. Porky's. They figured that it was time for one of their friends to lose his virginity, where else to go but Porky's where they imagined it would be easier to do than him stumbling around his high school to try to do. Their attempt as under-aged teens to try to get into Porky's didn't turn out too well, in fact Porky's had rules they adhered to, and a backwoods sheriff and Pork's owner embarrassed them - and as it goes in these films, now the teens needed revenge on the adults.While that is basically the premise here, the comedy is raunchy at points, silly at points, making fun too of everything 'back in the day' like racism, ageism and sexism taken from a 1950s male teen point of view too. That's what made this film work for me. The era. The female characters were pretty much one dimensional, but this characterization helped deliver some of the funnier scenes. One of my favorites is with the character actress Nancy Parsons as the prudish female gym coach whose purpose here is of a foil to keep these out of control hormonal male teens away from her out of control hormonal female teens. When she catches one of the guys (funny scene here too) and he gets away, she goes to the HS Principal, with the male gym coaches and assistant coach, etc. to explain how to catch the perpetrator and hold him accountable. It was so silly, but the actors made this comedic bit work and that is the scene I laughed the most.Porkys did okay for me for the first 1/2, the second half did go down hill with the laughs. But this was one of those low budget movies that ""could"". Lightening never strikes twice (See Pork's II:The Next Day) when you get a fluke like this, and I grew up so what was funny to me then, didn't all hold up a few years later. And years after that, only a few things still have me still chuckling and that's films like this go. The next generation has a film like this, and now this generation (2019) seems to have a film like this (i.e. 'Good Boys'), and so on this will go, but what worked for this film was when we saw it, it was not of our time, but of a generation 3 decades before, that WAS doing/thinking/exposed to what we were doing. That too made it funnier for us.This was not meant to be Academy Award material. And if I remember correctly, even they were surprised at how well it did, and how it defined a film genre that for a bit the bigger studios tried to chase and failed. Porky's hit all the right chords at the right time. It was silly, amateurish, unreal - but it was Easter Break entertainment escapism at the time. Viewing it now may not have the same impact, all the jokes and situations may not land for all. But it may for some, just like it did back then.",Porky's
50,baumer,Pure hilarity,10,2 July 1999,"Porky's is a film that has so many funny moments in it that you don't really have time to catch your breath before the next gag is hurled upon you. This is absolutely one of the funniest films I have ever seen.  And the reason for that hilarity is because of it's frankness and propensity to take risks. They don't make movies like this anymore.  Everyone is so worried about the damn sensors and that is too bad because a movie like this, while I can acknowledge may not be for everyone's taste, is one that explores teens in high school and it also explores how innocently cruel we were to each other in high school.What makes this film so funny is that the characters look like they are having fun.  They like to mess with each other.  They enjoy embarrassing one another and they are sex starved high school kids.  And really, weren't a lot of us males like that in high school?  Are a lot of us still not like that?You have an assorted cast of characters from Meat, the rather large ( in many ways ) guardian of the group.  Women love him for various reasons and it is his size and manliness that makes him so much fun to poke fun at. Then there is Tommy Turner.  He is the leader of the group and always seems to come up with the ideas to get his friends laid or in trouble.  You have Billy and Brian and of course PeeWee.  He is the guy that everyone likes, yet his exaggerated Casanova stories get him in several sticky but funny situations with his friends.  The characters at Angel Beach high school are hilarious and I honestly wish I could have known guys like this.The true strength of this film is the hilarity.  The kids make it funny because they always look like they are having fun.  When one person is taking their licks, the other five that are in on the gag are laughing under their breaths and all you get is a snicker or two.  And we can all relate to that.  How, something is funny but we have to play our part to keep the cherade going.  These kids do that with perfection here.  I also have to mention some of the scenes that make this film the teen classic that it is. The first is the scene when Mr. Carter, their principal is being pressured by Ms. Balbricker to find the guy who had his penis hanging out of a drain pipe in the girls shower.  Mr. Carter is doing his best to keep a straight face but he is going to crack at the absurdity of the request.  To make matters worse, the two male gym teacher are not making it any easier by snickering to themselves.  When Mr. Carter finally cracks, we crack with him.  This is comedy at it's best.  Also very funny are the Lassie part and the beginning when PeeWee is running down a country road naked.  You really have to see it.This film is unapolegetically crude, lude and vulgar in many ways.  But it is so damn funny that you don't pay attention to that stuff.  My gut still hurts from laughing when I watch this film.  And oh yeah, the shower scene isn't bad either.",Porky's
51,IonicBreezeMachine,Animal House by way of Smokey and the Bandit but not nearly as good as either.,4,11 November 2020,"Set in 1950s Angel Beach, Florida Porky's follows the sexually motivated misadventures of a group of high schoolers.Porky's was part of a wave of Sex comedies that followed in the wake of Animal House. Some of these films like Revenge of the Nerds or Fast Times at Ridgemont High put their own unique spin on the material that helped them stand out, while others were considerably less ambitious. Porky's is the latter.The biggest problem with Porky's is that the characters just aren't endearing, memorable, or even likable. The dialogue between the characters is true to 1950s sensibilities with casual racism and sexism, but there's never any redeeming aspects given to the characters nor much reason as to why I should find them funny. When watching Revenge of the Nerds or Animal House those movies give you characters that stick with you (Ogre, Booger, Wormser, Lamarr, Otter, Bluto, Flounder, etc.) but with Porky's I'd be hard pressed to tell you ANYTHING about the movie's main characters. Chuck Mitchell makes an impression as seedy strip club owner Porky playing the character like a mixture of Jackie Gleason's Bufford T. Justice and a skeazy pimp from a Charles Bronson vigilante movie, but that's really the only take away I got character wise.There are some mildly amusing moments scattered throughout the movie such as a crank phone call scene, a prank involving hardboiled eggs, and a giant novelty condem, but these are islands in a sea of failed setups for other jokes (including a running ""lassie"" joke whose payoff is underwhelming to say the least). Despite Porky's reputation as a ""sex comedy"" the movie is strangely unsexy. From its peephole shower scenes to the titular Porky's club the movie has about the same level of sex appeal one could find from a discarded playboy magazine found in a dirty alley.Porky's is a below average Sex comedy whose only reason for its legacy is that it was released in the right place at the right time. The movie rode the tail end of both the good ol' boy and 50s nostalgia waves of the 70s and caught the beginning of the sex sploitation wave of the 80s. While it boasts a few memorable gags, more often than not it is bland and does little to distinguish itself from a very crowded field.",Porky's
52,hall895,"Not funny, not raunchy, not good",4,28 November 2014,"Porky's is a coming-of-age movie. The teenage boys the story focuses on think coming-of-age is just about seeing naked girls and, if at all possible, having sex with them. So we follow this band of horny young men on their quest to see some breasts. They go to a nightclub where love is for sale but that trip doesn't end up going according to plan. In the movie's most famous scene they spy on a group of girls in the shower. At least that leads to a pretty funny scene in which coach Beulah Balbricker, whose name tells you all you need to know, lays out her plan to identify one of the peeping Toms. Sadly, that's pretty much the only funny scene in the movie. And what the movie lacks in laughs it doesn't make up for in outrageousness. Porky's has a reputation for being wild and raunchy but it is actually rather tame. If the most outrageous thing in your movie is a scene featuring a handful of girls in a shower for a minute or two your movie is not particularly outrageous at all. So there's no laughs, no raunch, and pretty much no plot. That's not a formula for a successful teen sex comedy. Toss in the fact that supporting characters, such as the aforementioned Balbricker, are more interesting than the guys the movie actually focuses on and the movie is clearly doomed to fail. The fact that the character of Pee Wee, who is focused on most of all, is incredibly annoying certainly doesn't help matters any. The fact that the threadbare plot ultimately leads to a simply absurd climax is just the final insult. Porky's is noted for helping to launch the teen sex comedy genre. It may be among the first, it's certainly among the worst.",Porky's
53,Karl Self,A porker of a movie,3,30 October 2008,"This movie is loved by many who saw it as teenagers. I saw it somewhat later in life (last night), and, man, I hated it. This is one behemoth of a bad movie with no redeeming quality to it. Sorry, all you Porky-lovers.The story centers loosely around a group of high school juniors and seniors who are all played by actors who are roughly ten years older. In the case of the girls, fifteen years older. Some seem to be pushing menopause. Others have brought along their children and grandchildren. One of the gang, Pee Wee, is desperate to get laid, others are peeping into the girls' shower (allowing us, the audience, to finally cop some T&A) and end up getting busted by the aptly named coach Ballbricker (geddit?), two teachers have it off and she (played by Kim Cattrall of Sex And The City, who somehow, throughout her career, consistently managed to get the part of the cute sexpot) howls like Lassie, and another plot involves some of the gang getting thrown out of a strip joint by the evil Southron Porky (hence the name of the movie) and his Southern Sheriff brother, and then taking revenge so epic and disproportional that it makes the bible's seventh son of a seventh' son rule look conciliatory. Some depth is added by addressing the weighty issues of antisemitism (""How do you know to fight so well?"" -- ""As a Jew, it's either that or having to eat sheet. I don't like sheet."" -- ""How often did you have to fight before?"" -- ""First time."" -- ""So what was that talk about the difficulty of prevailing as a Jew about?"" -- ""Never mind, let's get on with the movie.""), violent rock'n'rolling fathers, and pig-ugly fat prude cock-blocking sports coaches with 'double-entendre' names.I found the plot arbitrary, ambling and pointless, and the humour puerile, scatological and boorish. I felt like Jesse Jackson at a clan rallye. I didn't like the fact that men share a woman and discuss her sexual eccentricities among each other, I don't think it's good, clean, harmless fun for boys to peep into the girls' shower and stick their private parts in, or to collectively lose their virginity at a brothel or by group-banging a prostitute, or for a girl to have it off with a boy she doesn't fancy but merely at the behest of a group. I wasn't offended or anything, I was just bored.Like I said, if you have fond memories of watching this movie in '82 in a packed house, good for you. But right now you'd need a time machine to enjoy it.PS: I thought that the actor playing Pee-Wee, Dan Monahan, looks like the spitting image of Ally McBeal's Peter MacMillan. I had to look them up here at IMDb to find out they're not identical. PPS: The movie has three redeeming features: the Porky's neon sign, Porky's pink car, and the car's horn which makes the sound of a squealing pig. Cool!",Porky's
54,gftbiloxi,Unspeakably Vulgar. I Loved It!,7,18 April 2005,"Some fifteen years ago, my then-teenage nephew coaxed my sister into renting this for him and after dinner we plunked it into the VCR. Ten minutes later my mother declared it ""UNSPEAKABLY VULGAR"" and stomped out of the room while uttering dire warnings about the fate of those who exposed themselves to such puerile material. Well, Mother was right: it is puerile, maybe even to the point of being unspeakably vulgar! But it's also a lot of fun.The plot is lightweight: a group of sex-crazed Florida high school boys desperate to lose their virginity try to do precisely that by visiting Porky's, a swamp-water red-neck brothel and general den of iniquity. When they get robbed and beaten up by Porky and his minions, they plot an elaborate revenge that is... well... sure to bring down the house!The plot is really just the string that holds together a series of elaborate practical jokes--the sort of jokes you always heard about when you were a kid and wondered if any one ever really could pull them off. The largely no-name cast, especially Dan Monahan (Pee Wee, so named for his, er, shortcomings), Kaki Hunter (Wendy, the high school floozie), and Nancy Parsons (Beulah Balbricker, the Godzilla of girls' gym teachers), play it with an engagingly light touch--and somehow manage to give it an aura of innocence that adds to the movie's charm.The film drags a bit due to the script's well-intentioned but ho-hum subplot concerning the racism a Jewish boy encounters at Angel Beach High School, but that aside the comic episodes are a laugh riot--and it's impossible to describe them without giving the fun away. There's Cherry Forever, the discovery of why Miss Honeywell is called ""Lassie,"" the truly hilarious and infamous girls' shower scene and its aftermath in the principal's office... just one after another, thick and fast. It will never make any critic's shortlist, but if you're looking for mindless lunacy done with a youthful innocence, PORKY'S may just be the film you're looking for. The DVD has near-zip in the way of extras, and although it is offered here in pan-and-scan there are widescreen prints available. Recommended for that rainy afternoon when you want to remember what you wished your teenage years were like!Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Porky's
55,Mister-6,The guiltiest of pleasures....,8,15 August 1999,"No one goes into a movie like ""Porky's"" expecting greatness.  But if you get at least one good laugh, that's good enough.  Two laughs, even better.  Three, great.  Four, fantastic.I got more laughs than this out of ""Porky's"", but since I went in expecting them to reach the lowest common denominator, I got just what I came in looking for.Who doesn't know the story, o connoisseurs of lowbrow humor?  What you want to know is if it's funny.  Of course it is, but this isn't the best movie for family video night (then again, it depends on the family).I won't spoil any of the gags for you but I can tell you the biggest ones depend, separately, on eggs, oversized condoms, holes in the girls' showers and a prank call to the local diner.

They're our guilty pleasures, movies that we never tire of, but don't brag about. ""Porky's"" is one of mine. It's insipid, inane, and amateurish. The plot doesn't make much sense, and the characters don't behave rationally. But I don't care. ""Porky's"" is fun, transporting me back to a mythical time in America when it was great to be a teenager. Life was a lark, issues were black and white, and all endings are happy. In this regards ""Porky's"" resembles many of Disney's movies like ""Pollyanna"", a haunt of other guilty pleasures. Sheer fantasy, sheer entertainment.

This story of high school buddies trying to infiltrate a Florida brothel in the 1950s is neither classy nor sophisticated.It is, however, quite funny. Just sit back and watch the group of pals playing tricks on each other and sticking together when things turn serious. Watching it today brings back memories of some of the stupid things me and my high school friends did back in the late 1980s and early 1990s. We all tried to get into strip clubs before we were 18. We didn't see any trouble with breaking the law as long as nobody got hurt. We all were out to have a much sex as we possibly could. That's what a good portion of growing up for us guys is all about! That said, the events depicted in this film, such as destroying a night club and sticking our manhood through a hole in the girls' shower didn't happen. That's why films are made. They take ideas in our heads and try to show what would happen if they actually played out.Only the coldest and stiffest of men couldn't find anything to laugh about with this movie. It is in no way meant to be taken seriously. It has been criticized to the point of no return, though. Why? Are some people unable to laugh at juvenile pranks, or were they on the receiving end of them when they were in high school?If you had fun growing up, you will probably like this film.

This film has a lot of gross out comedy, it goes on and on about sex, it is a bit stupid but it is pretty funny. There are only three thing that Porky's  misses. The first is a moral, which both American Pie and American Pie 2 have (true love) or a grand theme (like FREEDOM and FUN in Road Trip). The second is a real cool character, like Steve the Stiffmeister' Stifler in American Pie or E.L. in Road Trip (all three times beautifully performed by Sean William Scott). Third and least, Porky's misses a good script, which means, that there are times in which the film kind of falls flat and gets a bit boring, because people are trying to create a good story where there is no good story. The jokes are good though and not too gross enough (not going over that line, which Freddy got Fingered passed with terminal velocity).

I don't have a problem with low-brow, gross-out humor, but I expect a movie to have at least one redeeming quality - a likable character, an unpredictable plot, good one-liners, or, at the very least, funny jokes. Porky's has none of those; every character is a flat and familiar caricature, every joke can be anticipated thirty minutes in advance, and there's no motivation to root for or care about anybody. It may indeed be the ultimate teen sex comedy in that it adheres to every possible cliché to the letter. If you want a hilarious comedy centered around horny young people doing dumb things and trying to get laid - compare and contrast Animal House, released only four years before. That's a real comedy.

62,PeterMitchell-506-564364,Pork this,8,5 December 2012,"Porky's deserves to be credited as a good teen comedy. Many years before American Pie came along, this little treasure did. The actors here, most who never went on to anything, are so good and damn believable, they simply melt into their characters. Sadly one actor, Wyatt Knight, a.k.a. Tommy Turner, the impish teen who was always at war with Ms Beulah Ballbreaker, the overweight female soccer coach, topped himself last year as suffering from some cancer. One guy, pee wee (Dan Monahan) the laughing butt of his friends, wants so desperately to get laid, one classic hoax scene near the start of the movie, has him scared out of his wits, running down a highway, naked. He even has a penis chart he keeps tabs on. At the advice of one of their friends, where his own advice nearly gets him half dead, they head to this bordello out in the Florida glades run by fat corrupt owner, Porky, who's brother runs the sheriff house next door, just as corrupt. Porky's promising them a night to remember, rips them off, the most cheesed off of the boys, Mick (Roger Wilson?). The Sheriff even smashes up Mick's car a little, to stretch his warning, to never return. Mick goes back and back, obsessed with getting even with Porky, the second time, the most dramatic, with him ending up in the hospital, so a certain revenge awaits, as the boys of Angel Beach with a help from authorities (Mick's brother a cop) get revenge, two fold and pee wee finally gets laid. Porky's is not all a comedy. It has a little drama, where a little is to be said about racism too. One of the new kids, Brian, a Jewish boy, isn't accepted by one of the mob, Steve, because of this. But we see why. Steve's dad, a real piece of .... has drummed it into him as well as his fists where he's a regular punching bag of his Dad's. Porky's is better than a lot of sex comedies, whether it's Up The Creek, Where The Boys Are, or the unbelievably cheesy and degrading, Screwballs. It's a sex comedy on a higher plane of worth, dealing with real characters and real issues. The eye peeking scene through the girls shower block is funny, but what will really crack you up, so much, you almost feel like you're having a heart attack is the next one. Ms Beulah Ballbreaker, such a miserable so and so, who pulled onto something she shouldn't of, is describing to the small and gawky principal, 70's, in great length the incident, but more so her plan of strategy which has the three basketball coaches in the background, in fits of laughter as this scene will have you. It's one of the funniest scenes in movie history. One head, drowning in a bowl of chili scene, may put you off it for good, plus witness the world's biggest rubber, that fits perfectly over Pee Wee's head.",Porky's

I saw American Pie and i found it more with joy to watch because of the love of the characters and how funny the situations were.

64,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,Kim Cattrall's Basic Instinct,8,26 March 2021,"This was one of the only movies that my dad used to reference constantly but we never watched it together. I think it was the ONE that he deemed ""too lewd"" to show me (though I grew up watching the gnarliest of horror movies with him at a very young age, like the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre, for example). I did the math and it came out when he was 36 years old. Now I'm 36, so it seems fitting and almost coincidental that I finally watched it this year.This was a lot better than I expected it to be. All I really knew about it was that it is considered one of the original ""raunchy"" comedies, and is generally considered one of the least tasteful films ever made. Tons of the humor is dumb and plenty of it is completely inappropriate now but a lot of the jokes, moments, and beats are actually really funny. The whole thing ends up feel like American Pie 20 years before American Pie, crossed with Grease, but replacing all the musical elements with exploitation-style transgressions, and elements of, like, Road House.Let's not pretend though - the best, and most iconic scene of the entire movie, is definitely Kim Cattrall's breakthrough appearance. Every moment with her is divine - the delivery of each line, the overall concept, and... the most obnoxious orgasm ever put into a non-XXX film. Such a legend - and it's so satisfying to know that ""SAMANTHA"" began here - it makes so much sense. Porky's was Kim Cattrall's BASIC INSTINCT.There are several completely absurd, over-the-top sequences in this that one cannot forget, such as the bizarre prostitution/machete ""prank"" in the early segments. It was also fun seeing other unexpected small roles like Art Hindle, the lead actor from Cronenberg's THE BROOD, as the local sheriff. And other characters like MEAT, I will not not be forgetting anytime soon.If you're into perverse, inappropriate comedy - you should probably see where the movement began.

I thought so when it came out, at age 17, and I think so now.Other than the film --- and I really hate to even call it that --- having virtually no character development, abysmal acting, onion-skin plot, and blatant hucksterism in spades, what's really offensive about it is how the ""characters"" react in the face of all this outright degradation...they think it's a scream. Hey, being a crass, insensitive moron is HYSTERICAL.The late Bob Clark, while being an OK director, had some talent buried deep within him --- it flashed briefly with ""A Christmas Story"" and ""Black Christmas"" --- but when he wasn't doing movies set in December, the guy's range was shockingly limited. He obviously would do anything for a fast buck, judging by his list of credits, and it looks like that integrity extends to his family in the wake of his untimely death a few years back...If this kind of juvenile crap turns your crank, fine.

Whites hated just about anyone that wasn't like them--even if they were white! They didn't like Jews, adolescents, Negros (preferred word deleted), and women were just objects of sexual desire. But--there were virtually no sexual outlets--even Playboy was considered pornography in many areas. This lead to a lot of sexual practical jokes by both peers and adults on adolescent males. People were not any hornier then now they just had no place for it to go.""Porky's"", although way over the top in the prankster area, really, more than any other movie, really capture the flavor of the fifties and was definitely an American comic classic.

70,mnpollio,Quintessential sex comedy remains a guilty pleasure,6,14 April 2011,"Accept the fact from the start that no one is intentionally viewing the Porky's films for scintillating social commentary and high art, but rather for cheap low-brow humor and titillation and you may actually end up enjoying this guilty pleasure. Porky's pretty much came out of no where in the early 1980s and became a surprise smash hit - largely due to its imaginative ad campaign, but also because the film delivers on exactly what it promises.Set in the early 1950s at a Florida high school, the film follows the mischievous adventures of a gang of high school students on the hunt to lose their virginity, with various obstacles thrown in their path. Porky's is the name of a legendary strip joint where the gang is thrown out of and humiliated at in the beginning. Porky's is owned by the titular character - a Boss Hog-type involved in various shady activities whose brother, the sheriff, aids and abets. The gang agrees to set aside personal differences to pool resources and get some revenge on Porky and his pals.Dissed by the critics who could not understand the film's popularity, the film is really like American Graffiti with nudity on Viagra. The success of the film as a sex comedy is not hard to understand. First, the guys that comprise the gang are distinctive enough and well-played enough to engage the viewer. A number of familiar faces and character actors pop up. It is not a stretch to wonder whether Kim Cattrall's performance as a sexy gym teacher nicknamed Lassie did not help influence her casting in her ideal role years later on Sex and the City. Solid actors like Alex Karras, Susan Clark and Boyd Gaines show up in various roles. Nancy Parsons is pretty hilarious as the nightmarish gym teacher Ms. Balbricker, who becomes a thorn in the side of the guys. The sequence where she tries to convince the principal to have a line-up of the male students' privates so that she can identify which private she caught in the girl's shower room, while her fellow gym teachers snigger away behind her is worth the price of admission. Of the guys, Don Monahan is probably the most memorable as the eternally luckless Pee Wee, who forever manages to get humiliated in some fashion. Kaki Hunter is also pretty good as the lead girl, delivering a healthy dose of no-bull bluntness.The film has a good share of belly laughs and is not afraid to push buttons. It even manages to sneak in an anti-bigotry message. It also succeeds because it is actually able to appeal across the genders. While the search for guys to lose their virginity was recycled over and over again in other films, few had the success of Porky's and its sequels. This is for several reasons. First, while the guys are not above leering at naked girls, the girls are not afraid to give back as good as they get and are oftentimes in on the joke. The film's matter-of-fact, unguilty embrace of sex and nudity is a plus. The notorious scene with the guys spying on the girls in the shower becomes far less exploitive when the girls discover the perpetrators and start antagonizing them. On a side note, what a refreshing twist it would be to have a scene like this with the genders reversed - do filmmakers not think that young girls have any sexual curiosity? Additionally, while the film has a healthy dose of female nudity, it is also refreshingly awash in male nudity - including surprising frontals - so that the girls dragged along to this by their significant others at least have some eye candy of their own to enjoy. This is something other films of this ilk more often than not failed to get.In the end, for low-brow laughs, nudity and titillation, it is simply hard to find another sex comedy - then or now - that delivers it better than Porky's. The fact that this remains true nearly 30 years later must count for something.",Porky's
71,whatch-17931,Might well be the funniest movie ever made,8,22 October 2020,"TRIGGER WARNING, ** this was made in 1981 and set in 1950s in the extreme Deep South. As a period piece, it does have a lead ""good guy"" character dropping an N bomb. However, it's also explicitly condemned by his friends. **It's raunchy juvenile high school humor, so you have to be ok with that. And some of it- particularly the fat jokes toward, um, Ballbricker, were as mean in 1982 as they are today.But, it does kind of make it feel like you're in High School and you're hanging out with your pals. Much of the film is these kids pulling practical jokes on each other. And the great part is, you are ""in on"" the jokes.And some of them are hilarious, like the ""Cherry Forever"" bit. This would probably work! And you get to watch the ""backstage"" of the joke where the large dude they hired to be Cherry's lover can't stop laughing hysterically.There's also plenty of low brow silly humor like ""Michael Hunt"" over the PA, and when Ballbricker tells a coach to keep his (basket)balls off her mat.The ""tallywhacker"" scene with Ballbricker, the principal and the coaches is one of the funnest I've ever seen. Again, you feel like you're part of it. And amazingly, this 4 minute scene appears to be one long take.Aside from all that is the prominent B plot about racism. It feels very much like an Afternoon Special. It's weird because you have these same school kids who are staging ""Michael Hunt"" jokes then being wise sages about racism.",Porky's

They were all smiles, and universal in explaining just how funny they thought it was. It sold me and my wife and I tried it.The movie was indeed at times absurd, often juvenile, and one of the absolutely funniest movies I've ever seen. It may well have the single funniest scene in any movie, ever. (Ms. Ballbricker explaining to the principal and the coaches about her desire for a 'lineup'. If you haven't seen the movie, this doesn't sound like much. Watch it and see. You'll turn red and be holding your stomach for all you're worth before the end of the scene).When you feel you are in the mood for a sometimes silly, often raunchy, but VERY VERY funny movie, put this on some Friday evening.

You people need help FAST. Yes, it is true this movie isn't refined, sophisticated and its attempts at sociology (EG the antisemitism angle ) are paper thin; yes, it is true it belongs among the juvenile junk movie production of the reagan era, even if the movie isn't a full fledged US production; yes, it is true characters are stereotypical & paper thin...as with most character of juvenile 1980s movies anyways; yes, it is true actors no way look like ""16-17yo"" (that is high school, not middle school like some accurate critic suggests ), but that is true of most juvenile movies, including the pathetic ""Beverly Hills"" of the 1990...Luke Perry looked what, 38? And I laughed crazy at another 30-something-looking actress playing the maladjusted teenager; yes, it is true they laugh too much on screen, but so much for many other bigger productions. HOWEVER This movie still oozes some kind of (weird) charm because -let's face it- it depicts highschool years like we wanted ours to be...fun...sleaze...pranks...some minor violence for thrills, but nobody dies, gets permanently hurt or sent to jail for life. Sure, women are mainly praised for a bunch of hair down there...but if the movie is women-hating, then women looking at which car men drive or the like (=movies ) are men-hating. That is how teen years are supposed to be, while old eyes see this and react to this like Beulah Balbricker. Not award-winning material, but neither the vile, demeaning tripe some want it to be. Or perhaps those people in high-school were debating global warming, exploitation schemes in perspective since Gengiz Khan & so forth. As well, end titles give 1981 as year of release. That period (late 70s-early 80s) was plagued by escapist movies, preferably set in the 1950-60s...remember the cold war was at its highest, and masses needed escapism.",Porky's

Very weird characterization in this. The director cant tell whether the protagonists are funny adolescents or dorky sleezebags. Everyone did okay with their roles. All of the characters are similar with the exception of meat.Cinematography:
The scenes,camera shots/quality, and audio quality were all crap. Now trust me I've seen tons of 70s and 80s movies with 10x better quality than this movie. It was made extremely cheap. the director is always adding in zooming shots that last way too long and it shows how little knowledge he had about film.Story:
American pie before it was a thing. Now in saying that I loved american pie.. but this did not have the same charm. The characters are barely funny if at all. All the characters are very similar and unlikable. They are nerdy and perverted but not in a funny adolescent way. The story is fairly random as well with no objective except get laid. A lot of scenes were pretty piss poor with zoom shots, too long of scenes and boring dialog. Tits here and tits there. wow very creative,not.

The odd thing is that there doesn't seem to be any real reason why it's taking place in the 50's, except maybe to get across the message that teenagers have always been, and always will be, horny. Also, to the people who say this is ""dated""... you guys do realize it's taking place 30 years before it was made, right?It's not the funniest movie you'll ever see, except for a few truly hysterical scenes, but you have to love the way it captures the fun irresponsibility of high school.

As a matter of fact, I found some of the jokes to be way too mean-spirited (I didn't find the torturing of nice, innocent Pee Wee to be funny at all) and I wouldn't put this in the same league as the ""American Pie"" movies.  Though both raunchy sex comedies, the ""AP"" movies have wit and the gags are delivered with fine timing and delivery.  ""Porky's"" is one of those effortless sex comedies where the actors literally laugh at themselves while delivering the gags.  There are some funny moments, but I wouldn't go as far as to call it a riot.  However, I was oddly engaged for the most part.  One reason was because I felt the boys' rage in getting back at Porky and his whole establishment.  The good ol' revenge plot can go pretty far. But as many insults as I have about the film's writing and direction, ""Porky's"" works as a pretty good guilty pleasure.  But I don't believe it's one of the funniest sex comedies ever made.

It's high-school, folk(s). Yet you will be compelled to laugh out loud. I've seen this monster more than 5 times and I still get teary eyed. Interestingly the situations by themselves are only mildly funny, but the spin and nuance the actors/actresses apply to their characters transforms what could have been ever so much more lame into over-the-top hilarity. There is magic in this movie. You feel it and sense the great fun the cast had doing it. This movie gels in every way. The same thing was attempted in 'Porky's 2' and seemed forced - which translated into a rather lame follow-up.Not for the easily offended or naive. Ultimately the driving force for nearly everything in the plot is sex. Yes, there's nudity but it doesn't get past a high PG-13 or low R, IMO. Also of interest is there doesn't seem to be an abundance of foul language. Oh, it's here alright but it seems appropriate and not gratuitous or indulgent.I'm not going to even cite examples from this movie. It would take too long and you're better off just going out and viewing it. Even if I told you what happens it wouldn't spoil a thing anyway - and that is what makes this an all-time classic.

Yes Porky is in reference to the looney tunes character Porky Pig. It is a logo to a strip club Porky's. The owner of said establishment also goes by the name Porky. A portly man who is so freaking annoying. It starts with Pee Wee measuring his morning wood. It seemed like it would be like American Pie but twenty years before American Pie which is both a positive and a negative to the movie. Positive for being ahead of its time sex comedy wise. Negative being it did not really stand the test of time. Pee Wee had the potential of being a funny character but there was more time spent on the other characters. His friends set out to help Pee Wee lose his virginity. But first a minor detour that took way too long to get to its punchline. The woman's husband returns prank sending a dozen naked boys running across the county for fear of this fake husband. Pee Wee and Wendy always pulling pranks on each other of which the crank call being the best one.

One of the most insulting stereotypes ever given in a movie, and copied in stuff like the American Pie movies. At least compared to those movies, this one is hilarious. It was actually quite funny back in the eighties. The fact that this was the most high-grossing film in Canadian history even up to the new millenium is proof of how horrible the distributing in this country is. Movies like The Sweet Hereafter and Goin' Down the Road have trouble making money, but this does well? Well, to be fair their weren't many good movies in the eighties from Canada, even though there was a few in the seventies and increasingly more in the nineties.

I instantly felt better. I realized that no matter how bad things got in my life, at least I could say that I would neither subject another human to such mean spirited humiliation and juvenile hijinks nor lower myself to support such productions.Anyone involved in the making of this movie should be disemboweled, boiled, kicked in the face, and then spat upon.",Porky's
99,xenazues,Thankfully this has hit blu ray!!!,8,19 January 2017,"I was so glad to find this movie on blu ray I got super excited. I don't know where I found this at. I know I bought it from Wal-mart and I'm pretty sure it was in the 6 dollars. Yes you got it 6 dollars for a remastered classic like this from over 30 years ago. I can't really explain how I hate that missed the late 70's and 80's. I was born 77 so i missed a lot of these great classics and was able to judge for myself.Now when you hear the name kim catrall you think of sex in the city. I put sex and the city on my list with the notebook (although the notebook ranks higher) with sappy things that are so focused around women and unreal I won't even play it at the house or allow anybody else to play it. But she had a wonderful decade just being a sex symbol. And honestly she didn't get her just due. You don't hear her name mentioned now do you? I mean Kim used to bring it with her looks. In this movie its no different. She was very beautiful and very attractive. And I'm so big on movies I read all the trivia for the movie plus I watch the movie in the directors voice so I can hear the trivia and him describe each scene and what it meant to him.Kim basically called him up to do the part. She wasn't too hot about nudity but she said ""sure no problem"" when the director asked. Back then females didn't mind dropping them down to do a scene or two cause at the end of the day they knew if they were a great actor they will be noticed for it. Only the female actors who have nothing to offer are remembered for that. Sharon stone did the same thing in basic but casino she was known for her acting. Same in this movie.Kim basically stole the show. And this might be the start of these sex teen movies. I have not seen them all. And I kind of want to see them. I grew up in the 90's and the fcc put a stamp on it. And when the late 90's hit i was in my 20's and they weren't showing movies at the theater like this. Not even close, nor will most directors do movies like this or the actors. So the private schools and the fast times at ridgemont high were long gone.And another thing the movie was actually funny. Yeah I watched animal house and that has a cult following now. That wasn't nearly as funny as this nor nearly original. Oh and the director said all these things for the most part did happen. Which is why I didn't get any of that corniness when girls lean over for a kiss or go ""dammit you need to like me, make it happen"". What does happen is like in this movie the girl will be aggressive and just like the guy above the gym we take it from there.As far as all the destruction they caused, they lost 2 points for that. But this movie had sex, a beautiful woman that everybody could love, a bunch of students who were funny, cops who acted like cops, and simply a bunch of bouncers and bar people who didn't like. But they made the film. The early 80's did a great job with nudity and showing horny teenagers. Not sure what happened after this generation. I guess filming for teenagers was still pretty new. You have to get your foot in the door somewhere. Now with modeling and a bunch of other avenues maybe they don't have to take that wrote. And if anybody is upset about the movie and the nudity. Well that is fine too.",Porky's
100,jimbo700,Telephone call for Michael.....,7,1 February 2006,"Porky's is the original teen sex comedy.I had the great pleasure of seeing Porky's in a late night showing on opening day in March 1982 in a theater packed to the gills with 18-25 year olds (although I was 30). I hurt for 3 days from laughing so hard.There is a portion of the movie, beginning close to the 1 hour mark that is the absolute funniest 14 minutes ever put on film. This includes these three hilarious scenes: Coach and Lassie in the boys locker room (Coach Brackett finds out why they call Miss Honeywell Lassie), then it segues to the guys peeping through the holes into the girls shower room, where Beulah Balbricker gets a 'handle' on Tommy's situation, immediately followed by the scene with Coach Brackett, Coach Warren and Head Coach Goodenough in Principal Carter's office with Beulah describing the ""incriminating mole"". There were people out of their seats, laying on the floor of the theater screaming with laughter. I have yet to see another motion picture invoke this kind of hilarity in a movie theater. I saw it in the theater 2 or 3 times in it's original theatrical run with the same response. When it became available, I bought the VHS copy, then the laser disc copy and when I got the DVD a few month's ago, I watched it for the zillionth time and I still laugh my butt off when I see those scenes. The acting is great for a bunch of no-names, there are actually great multiple plot-lines (in addition to the typical ""get laid at any cost"" plot) and the cinematography, editing and sound is above average. They made this movie in 90 days for less than $4 million and it grossed $7 million opening weekend and has grossed over $100 million in theaters to date, most of that in 1982 dollars. The only thing I can say bad about Porky's is that they should have stopped after the first one. The first pathetic sequel (The Next Day) lacked humor, the second sequel (Porky's Revenge) had 30-year-olds playing teenagers and they had long-since lost their youthful charm.",Porky's
101,Kreme,"surprisingly decent overall, very funny",7,21 September 2004,"Porky's is no ANIMAL HOUSE or FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, but then again, what is? Still, it has one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in film. The 'Lassie' scene? No. The 'shower' scene? Nope. The scene following the shower scene, featuring the coaches and the school principal discussing the possibilities of a 'line up' is still hilarious.The comedy is raunchy, that's true. The 'plot' is simplistic, sure. The acting is passable, but nothing remarkable, OK. But it is funny, and it is still a lot of fun 20 years later. And, of course, it spawned a thousand imitators and two sequels. None quite capture the original's humor and somewhat innocent raunchiness.Keep an eye out for Kim Catrell in an early role as ""Lassie""",Porky's
102,Bats_Breath,Not modern? Give me a break,10,9 August 2001,"One commentator named Jerry said American Pie was ""more modern"" and teen movies came a long way since Porky's.  How so?  I'm assuming Jerry is or at the very least was a teenager 2 years ago in '99 and thus is biased towards American Pie.  Fair Enough.  I was 23 when American Pie came out 2 years ago and I thought it sucked.  I suppose if I was a teenager my opinion would have been different.  Granted, Porky's was a bit before my time as well.  I was only 5 years old when Porkys came out.  Its not like I was a teenager back then and I hold some heavy bias towards Porky's.  But Porky's is just as raunchy and I dare say even more raunchy than American Pie.  Its a common misbelief to think that as time goes by, things get more raunchy and racy. What they didn't have sex and raunchiness in 1981?  They had it all in the first century A.D. Jerry.  Now I had some similar beliefs around 1994, 1995 when I was in my teen years.   Every teenager thinks their generation is the coolest and most ""hip"" and ""raunchy"", then another bratty generation comes along and thinks they are better.  When in reality, teenagers NEVER change.",Porky's

The gym scenes, Miss Balbricker grabbing things, oh please! Very farfetched but funny. Sadly, most of the story dealt with the pressure Pee Wee felt about getting laid. As if getting laid makes would make him a man and give him confidence. Any High School flick always generates thoughts of when we were all in school. When this film came out I was in High School myself and so was my wife. As a matter of fact, Dan married my wifes cheerleading coach, and voted for my wife to be a cheerleader at cheerleader tryouts!

Now you will think: ""this movie is offensive and it´s sexual content is too much for me"". Even if you are 90 years old, don´t tell me you didn´t think of doing (or didn´t do) what Pewee and friends do in this film because I don´t believe it. Now, look at Porky´s again; now pay attention to a pair of scenes in it that are antological: the one in the girl´s shower-room (I can´t describe it, you have to see it with your own eyes), and the one that comes after it (the gym professor telling the school director what happened in the shower-room). And I can count more like them. I think this movie is worth a look (and then some).It is hilarious and addictive (just read the other user comments about it). I don´t understand why there were no more ""Porky´s""; they are essential to my mind and for everyone´s too. So please you people: be more open-minded.

110,MaximumCheese,An unfunny waste of time...,1,24 July 2008,"I decided to watch this movie with much higher expectations. After all, it's routinely spoken of by so many as the prototype teen/college movie, so I figured it would be several times better than today's movies of the same persuasion.I was wrong. The movie seemed to get off to a good start, but quickly lost steam and became nearly unwatchable due to the low quality of the filming. Twenty minutes into the movie, I wanted to turn it off. The hallmark of a classic movie is that it still holds its appeal 20, 30, or 40 years after it was made. Porky's is not a classic. From a cinematic point of view, the character development is horrible by today's standards. Also, he movie is made like it's the first movie ever to contain female breasts, which is extremely irritating.The jokes are horribly outdated, even for 1982. They might be funny to the 50 and 60-somethings who appreciate crude misogyny, racism, and fart jokes, but to me, they were just pathetic and heavy-handed.For whatever reason, this movie seems to enjoy copious play on cable, bur I think it's best to just retire this over-rated suck-fest to the trash can.",Porky's
111,slcagnina,That was then,4,25 July 2009,"In the early 1980's, I attended Leroy D. Feinberg, an elementary school located on Washington Avenue in South Beach (for those not familiar, if you've heard of Ocean Drive, Washington Avenue is one street over). Behind Leroy D. there was a large white building that used to be an adult school; some of our classes were held there. This building was also the set of Porky's. I was too young to see Porky's in the theater – had to wait for that all-important late-night cable sneaky-view – a staple of teenagers in Generation X. I loved what I saw, but what boy wouldn't? You talk about sex a lot, and show naked girls, any teenage boy is gonna be smiling. And I felt a connection to it because it had been filmed at my school. But recently, for fun, I've been re-watching movies that meant a lot to me as a kid. Some, like Risky Business and The Sure Thing, still hold up. Porky's, though, doesn't hold up, but it is interestingly odd.First off, they don't make them like this anymore. This kind of unabridged sex urges and casual racism doesn't fly in the PG-13 world. In many ways, these kids' (who bordered on actually being 30 when the movie was filmed!)racial attitudes are both despicable and realistic given they're supposed to be 50's era high schoolers. There's a scene at the beginning where three characters discuss the plan to hire a ""N-word"" to scare the others in a prank; yeah, two of them scold the southern boy for using the word, but it's a casual scold and then answer, yeah they ""got one."" Their description of him is even more offensive, right down to his low-level labor-status and gold teeth. There's another scene where two of the kids tell the Jewish kid that, hey – they're sorry about the racism of their friend, but he ain't a bad guy and they gotta support him because, you know, he's their bud. The casualness of all this is shocking – the film kinda accepts it as correct – which it is, given the era the film is representing, but still. This is a comedy and it's bordering on maybe being too accurate in the worst ways.This doesn't make the movie evil, though. Bob Clark wrote and directed a slice of life film that got the reputation for being the daddy of all high school sex flicks. It is a sex comedy, but I think it's also a 50's era portrait of high school. It's not well rendered on that level, but it is that. And so Clark incorporating racism and casually dealing with it isn't offensive on that level – and to be fair to him: In the end, the characters bond with the Jewish kid. He does try to come out on the right side of things.But the weirdest part of the film? It's acted and shot in a way that the majority of the characters are difficult to distinguish; if you noticed, so far I haven't named any characters, because I can't remember them. Save for Meat or Pee Wee, named for their, um, god-given abilities, it's tough to remember these characters' names. I think that has to do with the big three: the writing, acting, and mainly the direction – unlike most films aimed at teenagers, Clark avoids cloying musical interludes, close-ups and punch-line dialogue – instead he films group shots with a lot of overlapping speech, offhand jokes, and laughter (have you ever seen so much on screen laughter in a movie? I haven't and I admit, it works – it does make a lot of scenes seem funnier, especially the tally-whacker inspection scene). If you think about it, either Clark's techniques here are unexpectedly arty or incompetent and make the film uninvolving on a character level (probably both). It's a slow film, too, with often telegraphed from a mile away jokes that still many times hit, somehow (case in point: the screamer. Who couldn't see the joke coming – Clark takes forever to get to it and yet, it does end up getting some chuckles.) Outside of those chuckles, though, what's left for a modern audience to enjoy? Not much. It's a raunchy comedy with a slow pace, little music, and remote, often boring personalities played by actors who look like they're in grad school rather than high school; it contains casual racist and sexist attitudes that are bound to un-funnily offend because they aren't underlined and loudly pronounced bad. The Regan Era was the last time that the 50's could not only be romanticized, but tolerated. That era of segregation and conformity has passed us by, thankfully(it had cool cars, though). Rock n'Roll was a sign, as were the Beats, that something was off in this decade for so many, and no matter how much Regan wanted to paint the 50's as the perfect America, he was bound to fail; nostalgia for this decade worked from the early 70's into the 80's because of all the strife going on, but eventually, I think people realized or remembered a lot of that strife happened because of the 50's way of thinking. Porky's was a Regan Era film thru and thru which ironically, he would have hated. But nowadays, like the 50's itself, it seems racist, sexist, and a little slow.",Porky's
112,billjsw,"Below average at best or Dull, misogynistic ""comedy"" for those the lowest common denominator.",1,14 July 2006,"For years I've passed up the chance to rent Porky's although it had a reputation of being the mutha of all teen comedies (i.e.immature sex romps). However I'm truly surprised I didn't fall asleep watching this dud. The plot is dull and seemingly obligatory that just loosely ties a bunch of tired and unfunny ""gags"" and a few mean-spirited pranks together. And don't even start me on the shower scene by saying ""wow, nudity."" Big deal. Just because someone is well-endowed that does not make him any good in the sack. If you catch my drift. I've seen nudity in several teen sex comedies. This all done in a very not-sexy, not-funny (or fun for that matter) generic way.There are other films of the same time that were not misogynistic, one dimensional and mean-spirited (see The Last American Virgin, Fast Times At Ridgemount High and The Party Animal). And even more so - those films are actually funny and have characters that you remember. Porky's main cast are pretty faceless, generic ""guys"". There's no depth or real personality to any of the characters to speak of.They are a group of friends who don't even seem to like each other. Pee-wee is perhaps ill-suited with these guys and then there's a rather tacked-on sub-plot of anti-Semitism involving Tim who is abused by his Father. Are we supposed to not feel sorry for Tim for being abused because he's an anti-Semite? Very pedestrian film-making aspiring to be a bit more indeed. Perhaps the film-makers are trying to tell us that prejudice, abuse and misogyny apparently were very much a thing that only existed in the 1950's? Actually I don't think they gave it any thought.If you are emotionally-stunted to that of a 9 year-old you may like this (because you don't know any better) and for those who believe that everything made in Canada is funny (If SCTV is a 10 then this is -8).",Porky's

It's actually a pathetic imitation of the real innovator, Animal House, the movie that really got the genre started. Animal House had some of the same problems but did have good writing (Doug Kinney and Harold Ramis), good direction (John Landis), good acting and was, well, funny. Porky's makes Animal House look like The Brothers Karamazov. It's a vile pastiche, patched together from somebody's infantile memories of high school, a dumb practical joke gone bad. And boring? Isn't this the one where the kid wakes up in the morning and refers to his male member as ""you big husky"" and tries to encourage it to, uh, rise? How funny. It does have one redeeming value: a sign of a significant generation gap between those raised on comedy which began (and in some ways ended) with the early greats (Lloyd, Keaton, Chaplin, Mac Sennett, Laurel and Hardy, W.C.

Add to this several just plain funny practical jokes mixed in between the other scenes and you get an entertaining movie.

119,imzadi001,A Genius coming of age film dressed as a Goofy Comedy,10,17 February 2017,"I saw this when I was a little kid and didn't appreciate the underlying themes till I just re-watched it today.On the surface you get a lot of goofy, seemingly shallow comedy elements. The ""Tallywacker"" conversation is pure gold. But underneath this movie is quite the genius of a comedy film with some pure, natural Drama thrown in for good measure. Every Character is cool (even pee-wee). They're so cool they laugh at themselves as they fail to take themselves seriously at all. A couple of the female characters are insanely hot. Particularly Kim Cattrall in her role as ""lassie"" and that Genius scene in the Gymnasium. But beyond all the cool comedy elements there's some purely paced Drama too, albeit not much of it, but what Drama there is, very effectively deals with themes of friendship, prejudice, overcoming that prejudice through friendship, parental abuse and backing your friends up. I know this movie is pretty old, but it still doesn't give a you know what. A lot of Comedy movies seem forced and borrowed, but this, this movie plays out as naturally as a normal day in the life of a passionate adolescent.One reviewer said only adolescents will understand the comedy of this movie, I guess i'm mentally still an adolescent in some aspects then, because I totally get it and live it in some ways!",Porky's

More recently there has been a fairly successful revival of this genre, with the likes of American Pie (and it's sequel), and Road Trip. I still believe Porkys to be the best. The shower scene is an all time classic, preceeded by the famous ""Lassie"" scene, and followed by the hilarious ""Penis Line-up"" requested by Miss Ballbreaker !

Tolerable after a few beers.Unfortunately, most of the jokes are old and stale or obvious with too long of a set-up. ""Mike Hunt"" may have been hilarious in 1953, but not in 1981 and certainly not today. The opening scene where the boys are naked waiting to get laid and a black guy jumps out with a knife seems to go on forever and the joke is spoiled before you even get to see it. We already know what's going to happen because they tell us and sure enough, that's exactly what happens. The film makers are violating some basic rules of comedy here.And even the much lauded scene where the two gym teachers have sex scene is likewise ruined. Gee, I wonder why they call her Lassie? Why might that be? Now having said that, a young and enthusiastic Kim Catrall saves that scene from being completely dreary.And what's the deal with the characters laughing like hyenas all over the place? There's nothing worse than someone trying to tell you a joke who can't spit it out because they're laughing so hard. Funny for them, not for you.

The only teen-sex movies made that deserve recognition are American Pie 1 & 2.The dialouge is tedious, not funny at all. It is a tedious 2 hour movie, and I struggled my way through it. Sat down and continued to wait for the funny part, which never came.It tries to tackle social issues of the 50's and currently (well, 1980's anyway), like gender, racism, anti-semitism & contraception, with very very very limited success. If it weren't for the woman who orgasms like a ""Lassie"" (another lame piece of dialouge and comparison), this would get a 0.However, she was hot. So it deserves a 2.",Porky's

130,Tristo99,a disgrace,1,5 December 1999,"Porky's is a comedy entirely based on humiliation.  Therefore, when the jokes occur, we cringe, rather than laugh.  There is no character development, or even any true sense of fun to speak of while watching Porky's.  But then again, if you have a cruel sense of humour, and find humiliation funny, you may enjoy this raunchy teen comedy.  If you're looking for any kind of originality or cleverness you certainly won't find it in Porky's, a raunchy, sexist 80s comedy disguised as 1950s nostalgia. Serious filmgoers avoid at all cost (unless you're interested in the kind of social criticism I so obviously relish.)",Porky's
131,mewnlxxb,When films used to be fun,8,26 November 2020,"While it suffers from a few of the problems most comedies do, Porky's is fantastic in all aspects. The actors and actresses are all great. It's way funny and consistent with funny jokes. The direction is also great, it's well filmed and extremely well paced. The soundtrack and the music are both good.",Porky's
132,1lawyer,Proverbial American Humor,10,23 January 2005,"Everyone who has ever seen this movie seems to remember it in great detail. Chuck ""Porky"" Mitchell is an action figure that will always be remembered by the audience for his very real portrayal of a ""river entrepreneur"". This is a movie you will NOT forget. It is a ""peoples movies"", not for the faint of heart. It borders on being an ""Art Film"". The photographic quality of this move alone sets it apart from most other films. It appears to have been shot on real locations, not in a studio lot. The signage on Porky's establishment is eye catching and cleverly portrays what he is offering to an adoring adult male public. If you are a ballet fan or a classical music fan, you will doubtless NOT want to view this film. If you are a ""Red Stater"" politically, you will find this movie to be a must see - several times at least. It embodies the spirit of the Television Series ""Happy Days"", except with a bit more edge, especially regarding the moral climate in which ""shotgun weddings"" were in vogue. It is one of those ""FEEL GOOD"" movies that has a mostly happy ending and makes the viewer crave more. And there are two EXCELLENT follow ups.",Porky's
133,nialldude3,Not that funny but has its place,4,10 February 2019,"One of the most successful comedies of its time, Porky's has been somewhat written out of the history books for better or worse.For me the film doesn't deliver a lot of laughs, the jokes are at worse immature and drown out way too far. The characters aren't particularly likeable and some are down right irritating with the actors doing a middle of the road job. Unlike other raunchy comedies of the day like Animal House and Caddyshack, the film doesn't have any memorable moments or quotes with the exception of the infamous peep hole scene.With that said, the film is actually quite influential in the teen genre. Although not the first comedy to do crude and low brow humour, it was the first to do it with teenagers and has paved the way for American Pie and The Inbetweeners. All of today's dumb comedies owes them selfs to the film.Overall, the film is not very good but it doesn't get the respect it deserves.",Porky's
134,sokol-51856,Funniest movie ever made,10,17 July 2019,"I have seen this movie dozens of times, know what is coming and still laugh hysterically every time. Classic scenes in the bathrooms and principals office, awesome characters, it just keeps on entertaining. Some of it is just silly stuff but so funny. Come on over and we can watch it again!",Porky's
135,sgtpepper_74,funny as hell!,10,6 February 2000,"Porky's is a blast to watch and it's unique. The characters, most notably Pee Wee and Meat, are guys that YOU would wish to hang around with at school. 10 stars!",Porky's
136,ccmoore,The Epitome of '80's T & A Flicks,9,27 December 2000,"This whole franchise is great for what it is:  gratuitous sex and hi-jinx with a group of friends.  If you view it for that reason, Porky's is a very entertaining movie.  I always thought it would be nice if they did one of them in college, but anything beyond a third installment of a movie is usually trash.",Porky's

138,djkopacz,Pitiful Movie,1,29 July 2001,"This movie is the only one I've walked out on in over 20 years!  It's supposed to be a comedy, but it's not even funny.  I like lots of ""silly"" movies such as Animal House, Caddyshack, and the like.  This movie is just dumb!",Porky's
139,SomethingLikeHuman,A really good time. Lots of laughs,9,13 November 2001,"Never in any film have I wanted to laugh so much.  How this film accomplishes it, is pure Genius. For every joke you get 2 laughs! One for the joke and one for the cast laughing at it.  Laughter is contagious and no other film actually portrays laughter better then this film. Its amazing how the director got the actors to react the way they did. The gym scene shows what I'm talking about better then anything. Laughter in that scene looks so legit. If they were faking the laughs then I'm one of the many who were fooled!  Great job!!",Porky's
140,wabbit99,Keep it in context and you won't be disappointed,7,6 December 2001,"If you are looking for a cinematic masterpiece, then Bob Clark's comedy about a group of teenagers at Angel Beach High School is not for you.However, if you are like a majority of people who like a damn funny movie for pure entertainment purposes, then ""Porky's"" is definitely worth the rental or purchase price.
Clark's 1981 film about Edward 'Pee Wee' Morris and his basketball buddies at Angel Beach is the quintessential teen comedy. Its raunchy, very adult in its humor and nature and hilarious, especially in the gymnasium scene.While this is not Clark's best work (see 'A Christmas Story') this is a far cry from being as awful as others believe it is. Go in expecting a laugh or two, and you will be satisfied beyond belief.7/10",Porky's
141,chastrigg,Excellent,10,4 October 2003,"I first saw this film because my mum recommended it as funny.  I watched it and thought i wish id have been in that movie. It must have been so much fun to film the cast are all hillarious and the mischievous characters are amazing. Tommy Turner one word - phoaw - Billy, Brian and Mickey joint second and the rest of the gang joint third.  The humor in this is way beyond any young comedy i've ever seen, sure Scary Movie and such like are funny but this is pure humor, not ripping off or following the ideas of someone else, this film is original, with the best cast to do the amazing side splitting comedy justice.  Anyone who doesn't find this film funny needs their heads reading.",Porky's

144,ahmadibeem,"who can beats porky,s",9,17 March 2016,"Always i find my self attached to this movie even after 25 years of seeing it and still the scene of the incriminating mole in the principal office for me is the climax of the movie , which i keep repeating on and on , and i still laugh out loud . No wondering that this movie is one of the gems of the eighties . and the movie is full of smart scenes and how to make life so funny , so worth of living with spirit . no body should miss it . funny enough in this movie that most actors and actresses couldn't make it in large caliber movie business except may be for kim catrral ( miss honeywell). some of them died . for other movies one would remember the sure thing , though in different scale , revenge of the nerds . but porky would bypass the animal house even ,in this category .",Porky's
145,MICKEY-57,Worth at least seeing once,8,20 May 2006,"Funny movie, as long as you go into it with an open mind and realize ""This ain't suppose to be Shakespeare"".The concept is raw and a bit sophomoric (s) but, it is a great mindless movie to sit back, have a beer and some chips and kill a couple of mindless hours.Like Caddy Shack, it is a movie worth seeing only the first in the series. The sequels should be lost in movie obscurity. If you were ever a teen age guy most of the gags in this movie will ring true, if only as a thought you once had of actually doing (i.e. The guy, the hole and the girls locker room}.",Porky's

147,miztexrgv,rotflmao!,8,3 August 2006,"O.K....First, I am 48 years old, female, and a teacher. second, I have seen all the Porky's movies multiple times. I saw the original first release in college with friends and peed in my pants laughing. I read a comment by someone here that if you still like this movie after 40 that you need help. Thank GodI can still see the humor in this movie. My husband and I watched it together and both died laughing all over the place again. I hope I am never too old to laugh at sex jokes, pompous teachers and administrators, red-necked bigots, and horny teenagers. A sense of humor has helped me to survive 25 years of teaching and right wing conservatives with absolutely no sense of humor(I think that, more than anything, is why I am not a conservative anything!!). Parents wanting to know about this movie: 1.15 and under; No way! (They wouldn't get the best jokes anyway) 2. 15 and up; with parents (but only if the nudity doesn't bother you.) 3. Language is very crude (Hey, it's supposed to be High School!!!) 4. I saw it in college, which I believe is the perfect age for this flick. You can really appreciate the high school stuff (not too far removed) but you can see the adults side of the movie. 5. Basically, this is just your old fashioned ""us against them and we get 'em Good"" movie with a lot of penis jokes.",Porky's
148,rathompson,Hilarious High School Hijinks,10,30 June 2006,"Porky's was the only chance for the sex crazed students of Angel Beach High School to satisfy their needs. Unfortunately Mr. Porky just didn't like the uppity punks from ABHS, except to rip off, beat up and just generally abuse. And thus the stage is set for the ongoing battle between the forces of horny and evil. When not waging war on Porky the students are constantly pulling all the pranks, almost always sex related, that you remember from your own high school days. Funny from beginning to end, you don't need to look for the ""hidden meaning"", the ""statement being made"" or any other underlining truth. It is just totally straight ahead funny! Good ol' locker room humor and definitely not a movie you take your Mom to!",Porky's

Cheers, and be pure!",Porky's
150,torskie,Still one of the funniest high school comedy movies of all time,9,3 December 2006,"Porky's was a pleasant surprise to me when I watched it years after it's screening. If I had been in a movie theater, I would have made frequent trips to the urinal and likely evicted for loud, uncontrollable laughter.The practical jokes, the sexual tensions of the teachers, and the sheer lust of high school vs. the moral majority is magnificently depicted. The shower scene was classic, only to be followed by Ballbricker's plan for catching the culprit. I still laugh until I cry when I see this, even on highly censored TV screenings.This should be a classic teen comedy, if it isn't a cult classic already.",Porky's

It is literally the worst movie I've ever seen.",Porky's

153,rebeccameily,Great fun,10,8 October 2007,"I first saw this movie when it came out and have seen it at least 5 times. It is one of the funniest movies ever. You need to see it twice to really catch all the nuances. It is just as hysterical to me now, at age 50+ as it was when I was younger. It's a little raunchy at times but not so bad that I can't watch it with my teenage kids. It shows them a little slice of what kids were like during that time period...a little harmless fun and games. The movie's writers also fought against racism long before others had the nerve to do so. I would definitely recommend the movie to anyone with an irreverent sense of humor. In fact, see all 3; the naked KKK guys being paraded into the stadium are hysterical.",Porky's
154,FilioScotia,This was spot on the real 50s,10,9 February 2021,"Porky's is the finest and most accurate recreation of small town high school kids in the 1950s I've ever seen. It WAS the 50s. I was a teenager in a small town in the 50s and let me tell this is the way it was. The raunchy language we used indiscriminately, mostly by the boys and the females who pretended to be virginal, but were a little loose with their ""charms. Putting all that into an outlandish plot to get revenge on a corrupt saloon/brothel owner is the funniest thing you will ever see. Be prepared to laugh your ass off.",Porky's

The movie is quick moving and introduces everyone fast so they can cut straight to the action. This is exactly what is needed for a teen comedy and this movie is just too fun! The follow up I thought was funnier than this one but I recommend you watch all three as they seem like a great series. Love the fact its set in a fifties high school, nice touches with the fashion and styles - you are always kept within the era. Possibly funnier for teens of my age but overall a class coming of age drama - well worth the watch and quite a feel-good movie.",Porky's

They could have very well been. I worked part time at Porky's from 61-63 and never saw so this much excitement, but the thousands of college students that came all knew about Porky's and was the place to go back then if you had the right identification, because you were checked at the door. It opened at 8PM and closed at 4AM and always had the best entertainment in South Florida. Porky Baines was nothing like the character playing him, but these films were great for lots of laughs.I have several of the Porky films and they are great entertainment.Jack Proctor",Porky's
