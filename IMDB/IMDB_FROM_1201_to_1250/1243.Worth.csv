0,blanche-2,The 9-11 Victims Compensation Fund,8,7 September 2021,"Michael Keaton stars with Stanley Tucci, Amy Ryan, Tate Donovan, Shunori Ramanathan, Laura Benanti, Talia Balsam, and Chris Tardio in ""Worth"" from 2020.Worth is the story of the attempt by the government to manage the inevitable lawsuits that will come after the 9/11 tragedy. An attorney, Kenneth Feinberg, who wants to help, signs on pro bono to bring in 80% of the survivor families and decide on an equitable payment for each person.Feinberg and his assistant, Camille (Ryan) soon learn that it's an impossible task. They are dealing with diverse situations in each case, not to mention angry and grieving people who are convinced the government is out to cheat them.Feinberg sets up parameters, but they're a disaster. Those who discover later that they are ill from being on the scene are not eligible, gay partners are not eligible, and on and on. The big earners, represented by Tate Donovan, want their award increased.Charles Wolf, a man who lost his wife on 9/11, sets up a Fix the Fund organization, which has many members, while Feinberg can't get sign-up from 15% of the people. Eventually Feinberg begins to understand where Wolf is coming from, the need for justice, and for the worth of life being predicated on individual factors.Several New York actors here, including the talented Laura Benanti as a widow who learns about her husband's secret; Carolyn Mignini, another Broadway presence, Victor Slezak, and a few others.The acting is wonderful. Keaton plays a man struggling to understand what he's gotten himself into, and Tucci is an intense and passionate person struggling to convince Feinberg that he's going about his job backwards. Both of them are opera fans, and both men care about the survivors. All of the actors are very natural and realistic.Having lived two neighborhoods away from the Twin Towers when 9/11 happened, reliving it was no picnic, especially for some reason seeing all the flyers pasted on storefronts with photos of lost people. The fire department a block away from me lost everyone. Such incredible loss of good people with families left rudderless. It was a traumatic and horrible time for them. And it's still going on, as people are developing illnesses even now from their presence on the site.One thing we know, there isn't enough money in the world that will bring their loved ones back. What they wanted was someone to listen, to acknowledge their grief, to help, and to look at them as individuals. It took awhile, but Ken Feinberg and his staff finally caught on.As an aside, I am a former opera singer. Everybody and their uncle was asking me about the song with the words lost my father, lost my ticket etc. The song is I Lost a Sock from something called Lost Objects performed by Bang on a Can.When the movie begins, there is a number from Die Fledermaus. On the train, Feinberg listens to the Lakme duet. When he and Tucci discuss Cecilia Bartoli in the office, they are discussing the aria Parto from La Clemenza di Tito that is playing. Hope this helps. So many questions, so little time.",Worth
1,Calicodreamin,The other side,7,7 September 2021,"I enjoyed this film particularly for its portrayal of the other side of loss. Something I would have never thought of as a fallout of 9/11 would be compensating the victims family's. The characters were well cast and well acted. The storyline was unique and captivating. Overall a good film, though maybe too Hollywood of an ending.",Worth
2,siderite,Keaton could not save this self serving by the numbers film,5,13 September 2021,"Ironically, the movie is about a guy who wants to solve problems by the numbers, a technical guy, a lawyer who needs to pay off thousands of relatives of the 9/11 victims so that they don't sue, bringing down the economy. The fact that victims of the terror attack using planes could sue airlines for it is something that is taken for granted in this film, like it's normal. It's like kitchen appliance shops could be sued for stab attacks, but I digress.Obviously, the guy sees the error of his ways when he hears the heartbreaking stories of the families. How could he not? He wrote a book about himself and then it got made into a film. Yet the movie cannot do the same thing and everything, from acting, setup, the artificial way people interact, the soundtrack, the emotions portrayed to the white on black text at the end giving some real but carefully edited facts is... formulaic. There is no emotion to be had at ant moment of the film. The crying families appear as insecure and angry and dumb. The lawyers coming to understand what they are dealing with are like people coming to a seminar or scientists observing the behavior of indigenous primitive populations. Even the dramas they picked were stupid: some guy who is incredibly loved by his wife and brother, but then there is a mistress with two kids who wants some of that money, a gay guy who wants to be recognized as the significant other, even when the state law and the parents of the deceased refuse.There was no explanation on how they ruled who gets what money. There was no visibility for dramas of people who had nothing left after the family provider died. It showed a period of two years in two hours and they didn't touch one bit how regular people dealt with this while waiting for the money. And as other reviewers noted, the film dramatized and fantasized the story so much that they ignored the fact that all of these people got money as a pay off and the heroes of the film facilitated it.Bottom line: Keaton was great as usual, but he had nothing to work with. I don't even know if the story was interesting, as I have the feeling that the book was mostly about the one lawyer and the film didn't research anything else. It was boring and unimaginative. Just like a lawyer.",Worth
3,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Reliably sturdy drama,9,14 September 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningKen Feinberg (Michael Keaton) is a legal expert, who finds himself appointed as Special Master, along with his Administrative Deputy Camille Biros (Amy Ryan), of the victims compensation fund after the 9/11 terror attacks. However, not everyone finds themselves as high on the pecking order as everyone else, and people are awarded different amounts based on their individual factors. Charles Wolf (Stanley Tucci), who lost his wife in the attacks, forms an independent support group for the victims, making them aware of their rights versus what they may have been told, with strong vocal support from bereaved fireman Lee Quinn (Tate Donovan), plunging Ken into a battle of the heart and mind.The Earth shattering events of 9/11 have been making headlines again recently, hitting the milestone of the twentieth anniversary, and leaving us to ponder at what a different world we now live in. And so director Sara Colangelo's film has a downbeat timeliness about it, finally arriving on Netflix after premiering at the Cannes Film Festival in January 2020, but obviously being put back because of the Coronavirus pandemic. In a story that reveals more and more disturbing new layers, here we learn of how lives were deemed to be more or less deserving of worth.Comeback kid Keaton has an assured presence in the lead role, the type of dynamic, humanistic role he can almost play in his sleep, ably propped up by a solid supporting cast, most notably Tucci as an equally learned man, able to match wits with the central protagonist, and the two create an infusing chemistry. They're equally matched by strong, realistic writing, that feels authentic to the story.It's another 'life is stranger than fiction' tale, and certainly much crueller, showing one of the worse aspects of human nature, with an unfortunate but fitting timeliness to it. ****",Worth
4,Cineanalyst,By the Numbers,3,3 September 2021,"Kenneth Feinberg as first written by Kenneth Feinberg in his book, from which the Netflix-distributed ""Worth"" is based, ""What Is Life Worth?, comes off quite well here, including being portrayed by the likeable Michael Keaton. Now, I don't know whether Feinberg deserves such a portrayal or not and, as his character in the movie might at least say, it doesn't really matter--it isn't about whether he deserves it or not. The bottom line is it's self-serving--about the ego that Feinberg in the movie is even willing to admit might've played a role in him taking on the job of determining how to distribute the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund enacted by Congress to, as the movie says, prevent the airlines from being sued and that potentially leading to general economic damage. Consequently, as far as the movie is concerned, Feinberg is ""the bridge,"" which is to say it's about him.Regardless, it's a grim job, I concede, but it doesn't necessarily make for an uplifting or heartwarming drama. Indeed, it seems the turning point is the concession that ""Moneyball"" on tort law for actuaries doesn't make for a good movie. Besides, Feinberg's mathematical formula is supposedly above reproach, as if it were an objective science and not based on capitalist and other philosophical assumptions. This isn't calculating the distance between the Sun and the planets. So, we get a movie about Feinberg listening to the families of the 9/11 victims tell their stories about their lost loved ones--not a movie about the families telling those stories. Its background in the horror of the 9/11 terrorist attacks may be moving, but it's a dull, even formulaic, legal drama otherwise.The main artistic thing this one tries to do, too, has been done better before, which is to place an appreciation of art within the art that is the movie. In this case, it's opera. ""Philadelphia"" (1993) and who knows how many other films have done this before. Another picture I saw recently, ""Margaret"" (2011), which is set around Manhattan and also, albeit less so, references 9/11, exploits opera far more thoroughly and in interesting ways. Here, it merely humanizes the character and provides for his eureka moment of what's portrayed as being little more than a change in marketing strategy to enlist signatures to the fund. Quite disappointing for a star-studded release timed before the upcoming 20th anniversary of 9/11. The cold calculation being that the loss of this movie would be negligible.",Worth
5,imseeg,"Great start, with good acting by Michael Keaton, but I felt this story became a feel good movie, while there is nothing to feel good about...",6,1 October 2021,"The good: excellent acting performance by Michael Keaton. Photography and direction are great as well.What's missing? Anything bad? Well, this movie turns into a feel good movie, wherein all the 9/11 vicitm's families suddenly start treating the government as a friend, while in real life there was no such thing. In fact there is still a lot of resentment towards the government because of the fact that a lot of volunteer aid workers did not get a penny. Not even for their severe disabilities.Still not a bad movie, but a movie which feels like someone is whitewashing the mistreatment of many aid workers by painting a rosy picture of a terrible mistreatment of volunteer aid workers.",Worth
6,yusufpiskin,Something missing.,4,3 September 2021,"Stanley Tucci, Ted Donovan, Michael Keaton. Three big names. In the script, there is Max Borenstain, who made a big break with the movie Godzilla vs Kong. But their way of handling the subject is very boring. The audience cannot empathize with any of the characters.",Worth
7,valleyjohn,A different look at 9/11,7,9 September 2021,"There have been hundreds of films and TV shows documenting what happened on 9/11 and to be brutally honest , I stopped watching them years ago because it seems like it has become a bit of an obsession. I only decided to watch Worth because of its cast and it coming from a different angle and I'm quite glad I did .Michael Keaton plays an attorney in Washington D. C who battles against cynicism, bureaucracy and politics to help the victims of 9/11 and although that sounds it a little dull , it really isn't.There is no doubt that the best thing about this film is the performances from Michael Keaton and Stanley Tucci. Tucci probably being the better of the two .There are no shock tactics used in this film which is good because we've seen it all before.Instead we get a view of how it was almost impossible to put a price on the lives of the people who died or were injured in the terrorist attack.One scene stuck with me . They we discussing compensation with the representatives of highly paid workers and low paid workers and true to type the latter just wanted as much money as the could possible squeeze out of the government and the lower paid were totally grateful at their offers .This won't be everyone's cup of tea because it's very dialogue heavy but I enjoyed it much more than I was expecting.",Worth
8,AudioFileZ,The 9/11 Story Few Thought Could Be Made So Well,8,8 September 2021,"A group of new 9/11 documentaries have and are appearing in this 20th anniversary year. While most focus on the events immediately after the attacks this movie is about the process administered by the government to compensate the victim's families and avoid myriad civil and class action suits which we are told could wreck our economy. Sounds pretty un-savory to the point one might say not interested. That would be a mistake as this became more. A bending of the government's heavy hand in the favor of fair settlement that began not so much that.Michael Keaton gives a very credible performance that will take the viewer from a healthy dose of distaste to the feeling that he found his own best self. Using some of the family's stories gives this a beating heart that at times is wrenching. The many stories of those left behind changed a man who likely accomplished the impossible while discovering his own humanity. Finding the way to this proves to be a compelling watch while enlightening the viewer to a part of 9/11 most never pondered. Yes it's a movie and not a documentary, but it is respectful look into the legal morass that followed realistically. Michael Keaton continues to impress and carries this story well.",Worth
9,qui_j,Not special but it works,7,19 September 2021,"The questions asked and the theme itself are both standard fare for any Philosophy 101 course. They are woven in against a background of 9/11 compensation, and the issues that emerged with just using a mathematical formula to assess human worth. The movie is nothing special, as the theme has been addressed many times over, but it gets the job done and the message across in an interesting manner.",Worth

11,DukeEman,"So, what is the WORTH of a life?",9,10 September 2021,"20 years on and I thought every angle on 9/11 was covered. But not so! WORTH dwells into the dreaded job of how families who lost loved ones in the 9/11 attacks were compensated. This movie takes that path and does it so well with director, Sara Colangelo (The Kindergarten Teacher) and writer Max Borenstein (who believe it or not wrote the current Godzilla movies). The movie has a thoughtful tone and structure that creates an emotional depth without being melodramatic and over-explaining. The scenes involving Keaton (who ages like a fine wine) and Tucci, are so well played out that on occasions it felt like a documentary. Even the bit actors playing the 9/11 grieving families had an impact, enough to make me tear up with stories of their lost loved ones. And the greed from the politicians, corporations, and the top-end of the food chain, was enough to make me sick...",Worth

13,Movi3DO,Impactful,8,4 September 2021,"A new movie on Netflix where Michael Keaton offered to be the bad guy in one of the worst time period in US, thinking that he was making a difference.I don't know anything about this situation, nor do I understand all the terms used in this movie. Because of this, I only judge the movie for what was on the screen.Wow this was an impactful movie. Our main character, played by Michael Keaton, was portrayed as a proud but awkward man when it comes to interacting with others. The way he reacted and responded to some characters baffled me and was just awkwardly hilarious. It was a journey for him to properly sympathize and empathize.This was where the complicated stuff came in. Each side, the victim's loved ones and the law firm, had their own situations and valid reasonings for their goals. It clearly wasn't an easy situation for the firm and Michael Keaton's character, and I myself wasn't sure what I would have done if I was in his shoe. Although this complexed situation changed the main character, at the end it wasn't entirely clear how exactly he solved the situation. I wasn't 100% convinced of the transition.However, another great aspect from the movie was that the writer and director paid respect to the victims by spending a large chunk of the runtime dedicating to individual stories. Some were honestly heartbreaking. I'm glad that I was able to listen to the whole stories from many people.Overall, great performance and complexed arguments made for a deep and impactful movie. 8.5/10.",Worth
14,lareval,"Poignant, human drama",8,3 September 2021,"Money makes the world around and most of times everyone tend to forget how important people are, more even if their lives are shattered or lost. And in a deeply fierced and greedy system like this, we ought to forget our human values. So it's refreshing to watch a drama like this and feel genuinely moved by it. It's a small Big movie. One that made me wish that all the righteous and social work made by the protagonists were abosulutely truthful. A feel good movie about a shattering tragedy that stills shake the world today, at the same time that reminds us there's still good people out there to help you and help themselves in learning to do so. An excellent surprise!",Worth
15,Xavier_Stone,"A controversial subject, all questions and no answers.",3,8 August 2021,"This is a difficult job to negotiate a fair settlement for the victims of any tragedy, and most insurance and large corporations have formulas for paying out in the case of injuries and death. Everyone knows this from old motor vehicle recalls and class action lawsuits.So when people start saying it's not about the money, well, it's about the money and they want more is all.Maybe the adjuster listened to more people and tinkered with his formula in order to get more claimants to sign on, but the bottom line is that he just paid them more is all. This obvious oversight is completely missed in the film and we are all supposed to believe that everyone agreed on their settlements 'cause it was good for the economy to recover and move on. Sure. Believe that with a truckload of salt.Everyone just wants a chance to spill their story and help persuade other into thinking that their loved one was someone special and deserved more than average. This film does nothing to convince me that thousands of people agreed to settle last minute out of the goodness of their hearts.Why make a film if you are going to gloss over the catalyst of the entire negotiation ?????? 3 stars for drama, but nothing really compelling to recommend this.",Worth
16,sweidman-28016,A Bit Unremarkable,6,17 September 2021,"""My daughter's worth just as much as anybody in a corner office.""Worth is about an attorney in Washington D. C. who battles against cynicism, bureaucracy, and politics to help the victims of 9/11. An important subject, it focuses both on the victims and families lost in the attack, and how it affected those who didn't experience those great losses that day. It's taken a long while for this to come out. With its premier at the Sundance Film Festival back in 2020, I would've expected it to drop sometime last year, but they waited almost two full years to release it on Netflix. It makes sense to drop it close to the tenth anniversary of the tragedy. I would've expected something more like Spotlight given the subject and the same producers along with Michael Keaton on board. Unfortunately, the movie comes off unremarkable. It explores all that it wants, but nothing more. I'm sorted of reminded of a movie like White Boy Rick or The Mule or some other recent Clint Eastwood movie. The movie does the job but never goes as deep as it should. There are a few emotional scenes that I liked and hoped would stay in that direction. But shortly after we get that bland biopic formula.The two main performances from Michael Keaton and Stanley Tucci are good. I preferred Tucci's character more than Keaton's, but still good. Who stole the show for me was Laura Benanti. She has a few scenes and she crushes them. Those were the scenes I wish the movie could've been. I also did like these interview scenes throw in throughout. We then get more stories besides the struggle to understand how to compensate the families. The script had its moments. I would say the dialogue was mostly good, but could come off as uninteresting with scenes dragging on. Sara Colangelo had good ideas when it came to direction. The scene on the train when the attacks take place has a good use of music and a good one take. That's the most I can say. The movie has its moments. But it comes off forgettable in the end. I didn't feel like I retained as much as I could. The subject is interesting, but I lost internet watching. This could be something people are really into, especially those who experienced it. I just think more could've been done.",Worth

19,joelwatchesmovies,Solid mix of legal procedural and emotive drama,7,7 September 2021,"A smooth and well-balanced mix of compelling legal procedural and emotive drama that ends nicely with the climax of Ken's character arc (""You're nothing like him""). Some of the script is a bit on the nose, some supporting performances slip up, and the dead screen-space for some of the dialogue scenes is strange, but it's made up for by some moments of cinematic excellence (see the gradual realization on the train), great performances by the main trio, and some cool camerawork in other places.",Worth
20,steiner-sam,A good reminder of the chaos and myriad stories that emerged from 9/11,6,27 September 2021,"It's set from 2001 to 2003 in Washington, D. C. and New York City and tells the story of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund through the eyes of its Special Master, Kenneth Feinberg. The movie is ""based on"" Feinberg's book, ""What is Life worth""?The movie opens by setting up Kenneth Feinberg's (Michael Keaton) bona fides as an expert on compensation for loss of life from a sudden loss of life by accident or violence. After 9/11, Feinberg, a longtime Democrat who had worked for Ted Kennedy, is asked by Attorney General John Ashcroft (Victor Slezak) to be the Special Master for the compensation fund. Feinberg welcomes the invitation, and with the help of his assistant, Camille Biros (Amy Ryan), and staffers Priya Khundi (Shunori Ramanathan) and Darryl Barnes (Ato Blankson-Wood), begins the process of meeting the claimants.Initially, Feinberg is an insensitive number-cruncher who alienates the relatives of those who lost family members. We hear snippets of many stories of victims and follow a few more extended stories. These include the gay partner of a victim who does not fit the ""formula"" because Virginia, where they lived, did not recognize civil unions. Another involved the widow and children of a firefighter who had other children the widow presumably did not know about. Other characters are critics of the Fund's rules, Charles Wolf (Stanley Tucci), and a lawyer representing only the highest-income families, Lee Quinn (Tate Donovan).The storyline follows Feinberg's transition to greater empathy and the challenge to get at least 80% of the claimants to sign on to the Fund by the deadline.At some levels, this is a heartwarming story of growing empathy. However, I wondered what the real Kenneth Feinberg thought of his depiction. In the beginning, he's a tone-deaf bureaucrat, which seems odd for someone reputed to be an expert in compensation cases that requires meetings with survivors. This rattled my believability gauge, which is always crucial for me in biopics. In addition, I found Keaton's ""Boston"" accent more distracting than reinforcing. And the ending surge to the finish line seemed a bit pat.But I found the story engaging and a good reminder of the chaos and myriad stories that emerged from 9/11.",Worth

The things that fail in the film are the duration of this, it is very long, the ending is predictable and the main problem was solved very suddenly.For me the film works very well, especially for the direction and the performances, but I feel that it lasts too long for the story it is telling and for the small number of cases that it exposes in detail.",Worth

It is surprisingly compelling.I'm not sure, however, how well the movie will be understood or received by those who do not have any background in law, economics, or policy.

Also it's a great movie showing the feelings of the victims, that they didn't deserved to be dismissed by a number on a bank cheque.

She captured what was the difficulty of the reality and completely avoided sensationalism, politicizing or pandering. I believe that Max Borestein's script made that possible. It skates closely to the edge and yet remembers the purpose of the story.The entire cast is spot on brilliant. Their performance allowed me to remember that day and also remind me of the job that needed to be done.

28,BijeshNagesh,Splendidly Portrayed,9,3 September 2021,"The movie initially played at Sundance Film Festival 2020 and came to Netflix only as late as September 3rd, 2021, which was when I got to see it. The film was absolutely worth waiting for. It was jam-packed with intrigue, intensity, and amazing performances.Stanley Tucci's Charles Wolf and Michael Keaton's Ken Feinberg were the real scene-stealers in this amazing 9-11 drama that was originally titled ""What Is Life Worth?"".Max Borenstein did some neat work on screenplay. His dialogues were deep and sharp.Sara Colangelo's direction kept the flow of the film focused and undeviating.Let me get something out of the way... There's nothing particularly new or original about ""Worth"" 2021 movie on Netflix. It covered a topic that has already been done times one hundred, namely the 9-11 terrorist bombings of the Twin Towers, aka World Trade Centre, in New York.This story focused mainly on lawyer Ken Feinberg, who was appointed to defend against the 9-11 victims. The 'prosecutors' included the families of the victims, i.e., those who weren't inside the airlines that collided into the Twin Towers. The court battle was not against the terrorists who perpetrated the crime but involved American political, financial, and bureaucratic systems that encouraged companies - in this case the airlines in question - to 'prevent lawsuits and avoid losses'. This plotline, more than anything else, made the film worth watching.Though his heart was in the right place, Ken found himself at his wits' end, especially when dealing with one of the family members, Charles Wolf, who lost a loved one in the crash, namely his wife Catherine. Charles started the 'Fix The Fund' website, which made all sorts of legal waves - among the dramatized events portrayed in the movie.Another person who lost someone dear to them was Karen Abate (played by Laura Benanti). Her husband, and father to their two children, was one of the firefighters who was called to the scene of the blast. He never returned home. Karen was quite compelling in her role.Part of Ken's team was Camille Biros (played by Amy Ryan) who brought great emotional and professional balance through her role as deputy administrator working on the 'Victim Compensation Fund' case.This was a movie about Humanity, and it beautifully covered several unforgettable angles in that regard. It was smooth and simple, and heart-wrenchingly emotional. If there was ever a time you wanted to see a realistic and truthful 9-11 movie, add ""Worth"" to your watchlist - you won't be sorry you did.",Worth

How much would a stranger think you're worth?,8,8 September 2021,"Michael Keaton deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the man responsible to work out how much every person's life is Worth after the world-changing catastrophe of 9/11. His nuanced performance balances smug naivety with deep down heartfelt sympathy with the victims' family.Keaton's Feinberg has to balance the chequebook, so to speak, in paying off victim's families without bankrupting the economy. Like an insurance claim calculated with an algorithm, as Fight Club so colourfully informed, the lawyer turns numbers into weapons in a fight for justice that may not shine for everybody involved.The cold hearted politics interimposed with the dramatically emotional events post 9/11 make this film one of the hardest to watch dry-eyed! Being based on truth adds to the weight it bears!For the company that also determined the Catholic Church's payout amount to victims, its job seems much like playing devil's advocate, where the government wore the horns in this case!

I remember Dan Rather at the six o'clock news saying ""good evening, you'll remember this day, for as long as you live."" While that was true of course, I never really followed the 9/11 fund drama. I suppose I just didn't think about things like compensation for those injured. However this film brings this fascinating story to light in a way that turned all of those victims into real people. ALL of the performers are first rate!I must say my opinion of the legal profession as a dirt-ridden tool of the wealthy was also well supported. The idea that CEO families should be made not just solvent, but super-wealthy again infuriated me. It's as if every contingency of life must be made soft and luxurious for the wealthy. Patoohy to that!The stories of the real people were heartbreaking. The gay partner who was left with nothing had me in tears.

That's the premise of Worth recounting the story of the compensation for the victims and families of the 9/11 attack. It is a fascinating subject ably handled by Michael Keaton playing the lawyer assigned to the case to determine the compensation. But there is a problem because if law suits prevailed the amounts paid out could be so enormous as to ""crater the U. S. economy"".So what to do with so many stories, so many victims and get this resolved within 2 years. Or in this case in 2 hours the average length of a film. And therein lies the problem with this film. It's a long process with many twists and turns and stories. Two hours doesn't do it justice but in this case two hours also plods along like the long case study this was.This film ran like the TV movie of the week. Fascinating, well acted, well meaning but plodding as gain only snippets of the people impacted. And the issues involved that seem to vary and change depending up on the victim. Is the worth of the mail boys life any less than the CEO? And that is one of the questions of the film.

This prevents that any kind of tension or drama to be generated.The movie also fails to create a connection between the viewer and the characters. It just doesn't show enought of any of them for you to care. All it does is throw in a bunch of victim testimonials and expect it to be enought.

This wasn't grappled with as title suggested it would be.* The filmmakers focused on two cases out of thousands to escalate the tension (a adulterer and a homosexual couple) which in my view diminishes all the other less interesting cases. This is real life, not for entertainment purposes.* The special master attorney did not get a fair shake of his skills and prior cases to gives us context of his own humanity.* The link of this story to congressmen that did legwork on it was given no attention.* The moral victory did not hit home, this almost felt like it would have happened without all the players if it took its own course. This is bad in that you don't have much of a movie within this plot.* The activist tendencies took so much time away from the central premise of how we value human life. Widows having to pay big mortgages and private school tuition is too privileged a concept to explore. The greater truth is all lives rich and poor matter and their pain is just as great. Justice includes those kids continuing the life trajectory they were on. That's how terrorists truly don't win.* The political tropes were naïve, likewise the outro and credits. Committees and congressmen flagged to look into compensation issues indefinitely. 911 compensation was not ever going to be a rush.* The performances were not great in consideration of the raw emotion available for this reality brought to screen. The initial community consultation scene worked well +1* Boring execution, with no character arcs outside of new information about cases coming forward. The appointed attorney challenged the idea of worth from the opening scenes.* The NY jew comment in Act 1 was not necessary, it doesn't add anything to the story, there were plenty of other way to portray the victims outrage.* Kenneth Feinberg's speaking fee is in excess of $30,000. Nobody should be under any illusions of his worth and other vocations that need figures assigned to them. Anecdotes of pay to slay programs by Jihadi's abroad had plenty of opportunity to be mentioned.* Real B roll and associated images was decided against which could have taken this film into the stratosphere and begging for a ballsy producer on the next attempt.* This script turned into a story about attorneys instead of victims. If that was intended, fair enough.* I struggle to sympathize with the passed away cheater in spite of him being a courageous 911 hero. His children's lives would have been broken in a deeper way, if and when they found him out in the land of the living.* The State is responsible to millions of tax payers. Calculating something outside of what they might have brought home is problematic. Everyone mentioned is rendered as a superficial caricature. The plot is too ambitious. Some novels like the one they borrowed are not adaptable to screen.",Worth

This wasn't due to the idea behind the movie, but due rather to the execution, script, and acting.The hecklers did a pretty good job, and the widow acted very well (she should appear in more movies), but the rest of the acting felt kind of fake or detached. I did also appreciate the question of what life is worth at the beginning of the movie, as well as the interesting facts told at the very end.As for the question itself, what is life worth: I think in reality that question is BS; that is, it's not really what's in question in a situation like this. I like the argumentation made by the protagonist: money is just money, it helps feed a family and put a roof over their head, take care of their various issues, etc. That and the 80% goal are what really should dictate the valuation to be applied here, not ""how much a life is worth"".Interesting considerations to make about all this can be found in Eccl. 10:19 and Lev. 27.",Worth

A fascinating start where the implications of 9/11 are presented, explained and the initial strategy conceived. But then not used sufficiently to maintain full engagement with Kenny's commitment to the formula. There are some vivid depictions of the real impact of the event on innocent players but handled through case studies without real develoment...except the Donato family story which became incongrous with the tone elsewhere.

This movie uses (reuses,rehases to death) the sentiments we all felt after 9/11 and the scenes between the victim's families and friends fall so flat. The scene where the widow comes in with 3 children is so hammy and doesn't work as Feinberg (Keaton) is just so unlikeable. As are all his fellow colleagues trying to find this magic formula. On that subject, what was the formula? Put some people together in a bar and they would come up with pretty much the same ideas!

The editor and all those involved in the final cut certainly deserve a lot of credit for that.The acting is as good as you would expect it to be.

77,twodrinkcinema,Didn't achieve that 80%,6,12 September 2021,"As we approached the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, Sara Colangelo's Netflix film Worth, starring Michael Keaton, Amy Ryan and Stanley Tucci, presented as an emotional, untold story, led by a high-accredited cast asking audiences the question 'What is life worth?'. In the end, much like Keaton's character, it seems to face its own impossible task and unfortunately falls short.Worth brings us the previously untold story of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, created by the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act. Ken Feinberg (Keaton) is appointed as Special Master and, together with Camille Biros (Ryan), faces the impossible task of administering the fund and assigning a dollar value to the lives of the 9/11 victims. While that seems like a dry, legal drama, filled with discussions of numbers, algorithms and percentages, its a part of the impact of these attacks that are largely unknown.To try and combat the dryness, Max Borenstein (known for Godzilla vs Kong) tries to tell the stories of those left behind and the effect the attacks and loss of loved ones have had. These are some of the strongest emotional moments in the film, as you'd expect. But as the movie continues they seem to be surface-level accounts. No particular story or particular name is memorable. It feels as though out of 7000-plus victims, Colangelo and Borenstein picked a 'representative' of each 'category'. As a result, while the emotions are strong and we feel for every character presented, the depth of sorrow that could have been achieved for these people isn't there. It also reduces the characters to an almost stereotypical level. A mother cries, a father gets angry, a sister's eyes get misty and a brother is furious. We also get to see the immigrant group grateful for their pitiful payout, while the rich white lawyers threaten Keaton with court action if their payout isn't increased.But we do meet Karen, the widow of a New York firefighter. Laura Benanti's portrayal of this tired-grief stricken widow is exceptional. But her story is rushed and the additional trauma of adding a 'mystery affair' towards the end of the film seems there to purely show another aspect of the trouble of the fund.If telling the legal, economic and personal stories wasn't enough for this film we meet Charles Wolf (Tucci), whose wife perished in the attacks. We meet Tucci in the opening, don't see him until one scene 20 minutes later, and then he's a powerful force in the last 20 minutes. Wolf's story is captivating. He leads the charge against the unfairness of the bill and the fund. He has an incredible history of advocacy, both before and after 9/11. But it took some extra reading to learn this about him. Tucci's performance is outstanding of course. Whenever he is on screen his gravitas outshines even Keaton and Ryan. But he doesn't have much of a story to tell or much space to use his incredible acting chops.Overall the acting is by far the strongest part of the film. The script is lacking depth, it's a big step from writing for a monster flick to an emotional-legal-political-drama, but Keaton, Ryan and Tucci are as strong as you would expect. Benanti's performance adds a realism that represents all victims and loved ones. The rest of the dialogue roles on as you would expect, without any deep commentary on the question posed in the opening 'What is a life worth?'.Colangelo's directing swings between basic storytelling and attempted-artistic, with varying success. Most notable is a fondness for framing the main character to the side of the screen. While in many cases it worked to highlight the rest of the setting (the wall of missing posters or the absence of another character), it occasionally detracted from the presence of having such high-quality actors on screen.The stories that Worth is trying to tell are incredible stories: the administration of a fund which can not conceivably work; the fallout of the 9/11 attacks for those left behind and who are asked to 'move on'; and the man who takes on the high-powered lawyers who are enacting a bill brought down from congress. There are moments where you're engaged in the task Feinberg and Biros are facing and the incredible process they must go through. There are times when your eyes might start to mist over with emotion, particularly widow Karen. There are opportunities to root for the work of those fighting against the fund, led by Worth. But there isn't the time or the scope to tell all of those stories to the level they deserve.A Keaton vs Tucci movie would have been captivating, directly pitting the distant Feinberg against the 'man of the people' Wolf. A Keaton vs 'the people' film contrasting the emotionless lawyer against the distraught and hurting 'claimants' could have been exceptional.",Worth

83,zddman-911-892844,Kept my attention but the tragedy continues...,10,30 October 2021,"I would of liked to see this made into a series; as this is still going on for the family's and victims of 911. People are still coming down with cancers and other ailments related to the 911 attack, this is a horrible life long consequence of the 911 terrorist attacks. There are still ""victims"" and citizens walking around that don't yet know they are going to be another casualty of 911. That is all I have to say about it.",Worth
84,canrahoooly,This is what film is about. GO WATCH IT,10,9 September 2021,"I just finished this movie and turned immediately to IMDB to give this movie a 10. I am disgusted to see that this masterpiece of a film only has a 6.7. All the reviews who say this movie is boring simply don't understand what the movie is trying to achieve. This isn't a compelling thriller meant to engage you in a cinematic ride for entertainment purposes. This is a carefully put together film that takes a sensitive topic and treats it with the utmost respect (or Atleast as much as a film can). To appreciate this movie you must be interested in learning about what went into getting the 9/11 victims fund of the ground and the lives that were impacted on that fateful day. This movie is a hard hitting drama that attempts to only show the viewer the devastation that went into 9/11 and the family's that were impacted; but also to make viewers understand that life is not fair and far from just, but it's doing what you can for the people around you that really counts. This movie is beautifully paced and kept me focused and engaged the entire time. There's not anything remotely close to a full performance in this entire film, everybody is at top notch. I'm not an overly emotional person but I found myself weeping like a baby during my watching. This film does an impeccable job at bringing the victims and victims family's of the 9/11 attacks to life and makes you realize just how complicated things got for those people as a result of the terrorist attacks. If your looking for a thrilling movie then this is not for you. However, if you want a touching movie about the tragedies that plagued this country on that fateful day and the people that did there best to help those people, then you will be astonished how touching this film is.",Worth
85,thedesq,An engrossing film on what a person is worth,8,20 March 2020,"What is a person's life worth? That is the opening question of the movie as a law professor Kenneth Feinberg poses the question to his law students. After the 9/11 attacks, Michael Keaton (as Feinberg) is a lawyer tasked as a Special Master by the President to decide what each one of the 9/11 victims or their next of kin should receive in terms of monetary compensation. The government has stepped in to help with the compensation because to allow individual lawsuits against the major airlines and the businesses within the twin towers would alter the entire domestic economy. The movie is a very well-acted drama of the business aspects of the aftermath of 9/11 put into human terms.The movie focuses on several groups of characters: the very wealthy who think they are worth more than others, first responders represented by two firemen, and a gay couple whose relationship was not recognized by law at the time. Finally, a civil activist (Stanley Tucci) who lost his wife in the towers, and is fighting to make the compensation from the government ""fair"" and more personal than the callous, ""formula"" that Keaton has come up with.As the movie progresses, we see that Keaton, through Tucci, discovers that every person has an individual story and circumstances that determine their worth. Questions arise during the movie such as, are all people worth the same as human beings or do we determine the worth of an individual by their place in society or the dependents they left behind? As we see in the opening scenes in the law classroom, generally a person is worth what they think they are worth. Yet even then, is our sense of worth overinflated or underinflated? The bottom line is we all have worth and we need to realistically discover what that worth is. What are you as an individual adding to society?Compelling aspects of the film were the use of actual footage of the attacks on 9/11 and the aftermath, including pictures of those trying to locate their loved ones who were missing or more likely incinerated during the attacks on the towers. It made for a more realistic look and remembrance of just how horrific that day was in American history. Music, especially opera music, was prevalent in Keaton's character's life. As the chaos and turmoil are going on around him, he often has his earphones on and is listening to opera music, which seems to isolate him as to what is going on around him. However, as the stress mounts, he is not even able to enjoy the music, because he cannot get the victims out of his mind. It isn't until this point that he changes his attitude and decides to truly help the victims find their worth.",Worth
