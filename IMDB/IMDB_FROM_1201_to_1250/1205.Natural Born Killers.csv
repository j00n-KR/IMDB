0,MartinHafer,proof that Oliver Stone is nuts,1,30 April 2006,"The first few Oliver Stone movies I watched I liked. WALLSTREET and TALK RADIO were good films. Then, apparently, Oliver Stone either went insane (the most probable assumption) or he became so ""full of himself"" that he thought he could do no wrong--and make up facts as he went along in films such as NIXON, JFK and Alexander. However, despite his ""truth impairment"", this is not the biggest reason I think Stone is nuts. No, it's producing an ultra-violent film (sort of like a snuff film) and then having the absolute gall to say it's a film that's ANTI-VIOLENCE!!!!! That's like viewing THE BIRTH OF A NATION and saying it's a film that encourages positive race relations,...or watching THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK and saying it's ""pro-Hitler""!!!! So, either Stone is full of himself and also full or crap or he really is 100% crazy to produce such a vile and violent mess and claim it's done to help curb and expose our violent society! Get that man some therapy!!",Natural Born Killers
1,Leofwine_draca,Controversial media satire,7,1 September 2016,"Oliver Stone's most controversial film is a breakneck satire of the media's attitude towards violence. This notorious movie tells the story of a couple of mass murderers who end up getting caught in a media whirlwind as they're pursued by a shock journalist desperate for the 'number one' interview. Stone goes all out on style with this movie and it's one of the craziest you'll see: back stories are played out in the manner of '50s sitcoms, all manner of media is called into play (black and white film stock, back projection, hand camera) and the film itself is an over-the-top glorification of violence and insanity that just screams offence at just about everybody.It's actually a very good satire – one of the most biting I've ever watched – and also one of the darkest movies you'll see. That's after you get past the first hour, that is. Word up – I absolutely HATED the first hour of this film, which tells the story of a modern day 'Bonnie and Clyde' and their murderous antics. Stone's outrageous direction is matched by the outrageous performances he elicits from his stars, and it got very tiring after five minutes or so. There are plenty of better films in a similar vein and the previous year's KALIFORNIA, also starring Juliette Lewis in a very similar role, was much better.Then the killers are caught and the film becomes interesting AND original. Obnoxious TV journalist Robert Downey Jr., is introduced, sporting an annoying Australian accent and giving the craziest performance of his career; he damn near steals the movie from everybody else. Tom Sizemore's on hand to show that perverts don't just exist on the wrong side of the law, and then the whole film moves to a prison for the last third where it gets REALLY good. Stone depicts a prison riot as a trip to the very depths of Hell and his use of the hand-held camera during this bloody moment of mass insanity recalled to me the gut-wrenching depths of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. This final set-piece is bigger, starker, and darker than anything that's come before, and it's where I REALLY sat up and started taking notice.I don't really like 'message' films as such – and there's plenty for Stone to dwell on here. The cult of celebrity, the media's obsession with violence, true crime programmes, insanity, true love, crime and punishment, it's all covered here with plenty of intelligence. Woody Harrelson holds everything together with the bone-chilling performance of his career and while I've never liked Juliette Lewis, she's impossible to ignore here. Tommy Lee Jones goes way overboard as the agitated prison governor and Stone has a lot of fun with the violence, script and twisty-turny plot. Weird – a film I started off hating ended with me absolutely loving it. NATURAL BORN KILLERS is one heck of a roller-coaster ride.",Natural Born Killers
2,SnoopyStyle,Cinematic chaos,8,3 June 2015,Mickey Knox (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory Wilson (Juliette Lewis) are crazed killer-lovers. Mickey rescues Mallory from her abusive digusting father (Rodney Dangerfield). They get 'married' and go on a killing spree gathering media attention. Detective Jack Scagnetti (Tom Sizemore) is pursuing them as well as tabloid journalist Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr). Director Oliver Stone has made a wild unrestrained satire on violence and the media. It's audacious and controversial. I don't think Stone has made a celebration of violence which is basically 90% of movies nowadays. It is deliberately weird and off-putting to not make this rip-roaring brutal fun. Juliette Lewis is great as always as the white trash flighty crazy girl. Woody has a zen about him that his violence is even more compelling. Their chemistry together is great and has that star-crossed lovers vibe. Some have complained about Stone's other violent movies and the hypocrisy of this satire. My feeling is that he's the perfect person to make such a movie.,Natural Born Killers
3,Hitchcoc,Why was it necessary?,2,23 March 2006,"When something comes along in the mainstream that is just plain sick, I have to respond. I realize that there are characters like the one in the movie. Heaven knows what a society we have where we, as an audience, glorify the absolute scum of the earth. Not all movies have to be judgmental and tongue clicking. I love the Coen brothers and there aren't many who can be as violent. This, on the other hand, has no element of belief and regards these sickos as some kind of grand people. I'm afraid when I saw Bonnie and Clyde, in the last scene I thought, ""Well, that's the way it goes."" As pretty as they were, they were murderers and thieves. I'm up a stump with Woody Harrelson. His biggest effort these days seems to be to provide legalization for hemp. I think this is a good idea too, but it doesn't help his acting career. He seems half stoned every time I see him. I know that I am being hard on this film, but I really believe he is a talented man with great comic timing. His roles are really beneath him.",Natural Born Killers
4,claudio_carvalho,The Psychopath Lovers,7,23 April 2018,"When the psychopaths Mickey Knox (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory Wilson (Juliette Lewis) meet each other, they immediately fall in love with each other. Mickey kills Mallory´s abusive father and uncaring mother and they go on road trip, committing crimes and killing cops and ordinary people. When they finally are arrested, the sensationalized journalist Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.) promotes an interview in the penitentiary with Mickey. What will happen next?""Natural Born Killers"" is a film written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Oliver Stone with stylized violence. The love story of the psychopaths Mickey and Mallory has bizarre characters and a criticism to the yellow journalism. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Assassinos por Natureza"" (""Killers by Nature"")",Natural Born Killers
5,kosmasp,Love it or hate it,9,4 April 2007,"I'm pretty sure, many who reviewed this movie here, have used this summary line. It's just the fact that it is true. It seems that most people can only love or hate this movie. They can not be indifferent about it though ... Which is of course something that suits Mr. Stone better than a ""the movie is OK"" statement. I'm pretty sure he wouldn't like that! And as much as he wouldn't like that, the same bitterness (or maybe hatred) is coming from Quentin Tarantino. He absolutely loathes what Oliver Stone has done with his material (original script is by Tarantino). Although I can't say, what a more accurately Tarantino script would have looked like as movie, I can say that I do like what Stone did. I'm more than satisfied with his interpretation and re-imagining of Tarantino's original draft! For some it might be too violent, for some too crazy (some shots just seem ... out of this world, which is of course the point). The colour palette Stone uses is also incredible (especially the green tone for certain emotional charged scenes, because green represents something in the movie ... when you watch it you will figure it out), but he was also experimenting a lot with this film. He used different cameras, different lenses, different formats ... anything he could get his hands on that would produce ""film"".This paragraph sees a comparison with another movie, if you don't want to read this, just skip it! Many have compared it to Bonnie & Clyde, but for me there are more parallels to the Terence Malick movie Badlands to be found here!And of course his experiment was incredible successful (I'm not saying that you will like it, but that was what Stone was aiming for!)",Natural Born Killers
6,lee_eisenberg,"interesting idea, killing us softly",7,15 June 2006,"Watching ""Natural Born Killers"", I can certainly see why it caused so much controversy. Portraying husband and wife mass murderers Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory Knox (Juliette Lewis), the movie doesn't leave you with a soft feeling in your stomach. But I think that simply writing the movie off as a violent screed misses the point. It was also showing how the TV interviewer (Robert Downey Jr) glorifies them; isn't it protocol in our society for the media to heroify killers? So maybe the two murderers here are the protagonists. When you think about it, Oliver Stone is showing the degenerate state of our society. We could try to do something about the conditions that drive people to become killers, but we lock them up and let the media lionize them. In short, we have become the Law and Order-obsessed Sensationalistic States of America.Anyway, I do actually recommend this movie. I do not blame it for school shootings; I blame society. Are Mickey and Mallory a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde? That's debatable. Also starring Tom Sizemore, Rodney Dangerfield, Jared Harris, Edie McClurg, Russell Means and Tommy Lee Jones.",Natural Born Killers
7,jboothmillard,Natural Born Killers,9,8 September 2006,"This is a really clever film that uses all media that we are used to, whether it is drama, documentary, film itself, the news or even a comedy sitcom, to tell a fantastic violent love story, from Golden Globe nominated director Oliver Stone. Mickey Knox (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory Knox (Juliette Lewis) are two psychotic killers on the run and madly in love, they even cut their hands so they could join their blood for a fake marriage, in front of God and his land. For a while it tells how they met and what they escape after committing many murders, and then they are caught and imprisoned. Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.) is the documentary maker who is interested in and almost cares about Mickey and Mallory's killings and relationship together. Warden Dwight McClusky (Tommy Lee Jones) is the easily angered man who will stop at nothing to make sure they are kept in custody, or dead! Also starring Tom Sizemore as Det. Jack Scagnetti, Rodney Dangerfield as Ed Wilson - Mallory's Dad and O-Lan Jones as Mabel. This film, along with A Clockwork Orange, has been criticised for controversially glamorising violence, in this case, making Mickey and Mallory media heroes. The soundtrack for the film, with songs like Leonard Cohen's ""Waiting for the Miracle"", Cowboy Junkies' ""Sweet Jane"", Patsy Cline's ""Back In Baby's Arms"", A.O.S.'s ""History (Repeats Itself)"" and Leonard Cohen's ""The Future"" is brilliant. An excellent satirical crime drama, with fantastic performances from Harrelson, the gorgeous Lewis, Downey Jr. and Jones, with plenty of romance and violence that a film needs, a must see. Robert Downey Jr. was number 62 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very, very good!",Natural Born Killers
8,ccthemovieman-1,"One Of The Wildest, Sickest & Craziest Films You'll Ever See",7,5 November 2006,"Yikes, this is a sick movie and one of the wildest I've ever watched. THE GOOD - This is so stylishly-filmed it's unbelievable. The wild camera techniques - quick flashes, sudden changes from color to black-and-white and back, distorted sound bytes, tilted camera angles, wild colors and symbolic images, distorted sound bytes - are all fascinating to watch. Then there's the crazy story, which ranges from really good to really bad. It's good to see the tabloid media mentality mocked for the trash it is, glorifying evil just to get ratings and the evil killers feeding off that media frenzy. Most of the characters in this film, as bad as they are, are definitely attention-getting. The two leads, ""Mickey and Mallory"" are two names that now go together, thanks to this film and the ultra-sleazy portrayals of them by Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis.THE BAD NEWS - Most of the people in this film, if not all, are so vile, so profane, so morally bankrupt, so disgusting you want to take a shower after watching this film. Even the film critics who gravitate toward evil were repulsed by this movie. I actually enjoyed the story up to a point: about the halfway mark. After that, it becomes one gigantic mess, almost too difficult to watch in one sitting. I am mainly referring to all the scenes in the prison including the drawn- out riot/prison break, which goes on way too long. Over 20 usages of the Lord's name in vain - almost all of them in the second half of the movie, didn't help in my rating. Tommy Lee Jones, as the warden, and Robert Downey, as the Aussie scumbag tabloid reporter, absolutely go over-the-top.OVERALL - In order to stomach this film, you have to look at it as some outrageous satire on violence and the media and take these characters as extreme cartoon-like people and nothing else. Take nothing seriously here. It might help to wear earplugs, too, in profanity and just plan noise bother you.",Natural Born Killers
9,rmax304823,Warning: Movie May Be Hazardous to Mental Health.,5,29 January 2010,"What a whirlagig of a movie. It is in your face every second of its running time. It never stops. It may take a lickin but it keeps on blaring. The only soothing thing about it is the musical score, which ranges from ""A Night on Bald Mountain"" to the heftier portions of ""Carmina Burana"" when the electric guitars aren't whanging and the electronic drums not palpitating.The story, insofar as I could make it out among the glitz, roughly follows that of Starkweather and Fugate in the 1950s. Woody Harrelson is Mickey Knox. He runs off with teen-aged Juliette Lewis after he kills her hated father. They indulge themselves in a spree of moral nihilism. Dead bodies abound. There are bath tubs of gore. The screen, and the people on it, are riddled with bullet holes.The malignant duo are turned into heroes by the media. Fan clubs spring up. Their Hooper rating goes up with each new pile of cadavers. Finally, though, they are cornered by police, led by Detective Scagnetti, famous as the author of a book called ""Scagnetti on Scagnetti."" The two are isolated for a year in the same penitentiary.A rabidly ambitious Australian journalist, Robert Downey, Jr., who hosts a TV program called ""American Maniacs"" is given permission to interview Harrelson. But Woody, no more of a slouch in the department of brains than in gonads, grabs a shotgun during the interview, rescues Lewis, and shoots his way out of prison, while the elated Downey follows them with his TV camera and immortalizes them.Well! This movie raises a lot of questions. The first question is, ""Why was it made?"" The director was Oliver Stone and I guess his message is clear enough. The media and violence feed on one another. You know -- ""If it bleeds, it leads""? But was it really necessary to put the viewer through the wringer like that? Okay. Stone understandably disapproves of the degradation of vernacular culture, but what did WE ever do to him? I can't speak for you, but he doesn't even KNOW me! Some of the cinematic chicanery is germane to the story or the message it puts so much effort into conveying. The tornado that permits Harrelson to escape from his first prison is straight out of ""The Wizard of Oz."" During scenes of violence, there are momentary inserts of cartoon monsters. Lewis's tragic home life is presented with a laugh track as a situation comedy. We get it. The visual media intrude into every aspect of our lives and we frame our experiences in accordance with the models they provide.But other exercises in directorial pyrotechnics lead nowhere except to confusion. There is an ordinary two-shot of law enforcement officers -- Tom Sizemore and Tommy Lee Jones -- walking along a corridor. The simple scene goes from color to black and white to negative and back; from slow motion to step motion; to point-of-view shots of Jones' shoes. Why? The tricks tell us nothing about the story, the characters, or the moral principle.The title of the movie, ""Natural Born Killers"", is Harrelson's reply to Downey's query about why Harrelson committed those dozens of murders. Inmates have ready responses to questions like that. (In sociology they're part of a generic process called ""accounting."") Harrelson is saying, ""I did it because that's the kind of guy I am."" He goes on to explain that murder is part of nature. That's not bad as far as it goes, although it's utterly meaningless. Other, real examples that I've heard inmates give for theft or murder include, ""It was nothing personal,"" and (for a killing in prison), ""He had no business being there (in the wrong wing)."" They're not meant to be taken literally. They're just a way of indicating that logic is dispensable because there is no answer. Incidentally, when Lewis unzips Harrelson's trousers in the visitor's room, that conforms to my observations at the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo. (I was there for a job interview as a psychologist.) I hope that last paragraph wasn't too scrambled. I think I'm still a little dizzy. How did all these tiny butterflies get into my office in the dead of winter? Gee. They're chartreuse.",Natural Born Killers
10,BA_Harrison,"In the words of Mickey Knox: ""I'm not 100% sure what it's saying."" But I like it.",8,19 April 2015,"When I originally saw NBK back in 1994 I didn't enjoy it very much: I think it overloaded my senses. Now, years later, having experienced a lot of extreme cinema from all over the world, I've come to appreciate the film for what it is—a daring, experimental, psychedelic, surreal, audio/visual trip into a world of psychotic violence that delivers symbolism, social commentary, and sheer excess in spades. It's a film that, in all honesty, I probably need to watch a few more times with the director's commentary turned on to totally 'get it', but at least now I can see what some, if not all, of the fuss was about.Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis play Mickey and Mallory Knox, two psychos in love, who lead a trail of terror across America, becoming icons of popular culture in the process, glorified by the media, worshipped by a generation for whom exposure to violence has become an everyday part of life. Working from a story by Quentin Tarantino, director Oliver Stone uses a vast array of film-making techniques to tell his tale: black and white imagery, canted angles, strong lighting, over saturated colours, grainy stock footage, hallucinatory animation, crisp 35mm film. The effect is both chaotic and unsettling, mirroring the messed-up psyches of its central characters.Not only is the film a feast for the eyes and ears, it also provides plenty of food for thought: Is the media guilty of promoting violence? Is killing simply in some people's nature? Are those representing the law sometimes as corrupt as those they are chasing? Is Juliette Lewis as mad as she seems? Is the Rodney Dangerfield sitcom sequence one of the most disturbing scenes ever filmed?",Natural Born Killers
11,moonspinner55,Comic-book violence taken to the bloody extreme...debased satire is sometimes pungent but seldom funny,3,29 September 2010,"Psychopathic sweethearts on the road to Hell, gleefully leaving a trail of dead bodies (including those of her parents) in their wake. Director Oliver Stone's loco-manic rendering of cartoon depravity, shot in black-and-white and carnival-nightmare color, never once attempts to get its viewers from Point A to Point B without first a nihilistic display of violence (usually brought on by sex). Stone, working from a script cobbled together by David Veloz, Richard Rutowski, and himself (from a story by Quentin Tarantino), hypes the action up to the nth degree, to a level where the sadistic images finally don't mean anything--nor do they provoke a reaction. The picture, variably made and acted, benumbs the audience, so there's no sense of exhilaration in the technique. However, one can intrinsically perceive this is essentially a square piece of goods posing as a mocking diatribe against our already-benumbed society: it thumbs its own nose at the world and then congratulates itself. *1/2 from ****",Natural Born Killers
12,Quinoa1984,"Crazy and disturbing, one of the best films of 1994",9,20 March 2000,"Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers is one of the oddest pieces of cinema I've ever seen. I say this even as I know (and have read parts of) Quentin Tarantino's original screenplay, taken out of his hands by a mix of Hollywood elements, was mish-mashed into Oliver Stone's wild, very symbolic vision of satire on violence and media in America. But somehow, as an Stone movie it does work. That's not to say it isn't a difficult film on a first (or second or third) go around, but it has more power and uncompromising vitality in its style than many films could care to mention. Like Stone's later film Alexander, it will polarize audiences, but that doesn't mean Stone doesn't try- and, indeed, this time around he is a lot more adept at keeping the screws tightening and keeping track on the outrageous nature of these people. What helps is the cast including Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Downey Jr., and Rodney Dangerfield in the surprise cast of the moment (Tarantino reportedly hated his character, easy to see why, but its such a screwed up challenge its mesmerizing. The core story itself, however much it sticks to the source, is worth telling, and springing out of it Robert Richardson's delirious and spectacular camera-work is among his best. And when it does get violent, even through its exciting moments it still goes lengths to critique itself. The point of the film could be perhaps summed up as this- these characters, both killers and their media counterparts, have no shame, but what about us then? One of the strangest trips of an exploitation flick-gone-Godard-gone-Corman ever to be released (or escaped) onto celluloid.",Natural Born Killers
13,wes-connors,A Red-Blooded American Man and Woman,9,1 September 2008,"In 1994, Oliver Stone held a mirror up to the face of America's preoccupation with mindless violence, and most recoiled in disgust. It was a good sign! Alas, the obsession remains; and, with a few twists and turns unforeseen in Mr. Stone's film. Perhaps, it won't end until a ""reality show"" films an actual ""Mickey and Mallory Knox"" in action. Until then, ""Natural Born Killers"" gives the lowest common dominator exactly what they won't admit they desire: ""The gory details."" Thankfully, Stone and his skillful crew depict the violence in an artful, poetic, and (sometimes) humorous manner. Violent or not, it is an excellent piece of film-making. Stone, with photographer Robert Richardson, uses film types and techniques in an extraordinarily powerful way; the differing styles are a relevant enhancement of the story, rather than a catalog of gimmicks.Stone brilliantly captures 1990s TV media (and beyond). In particular, Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of an Australian Geraldo Rivera-type interviewer ""Wayne Gale"" is a dead-on treasure. This type of interviewer peddles the perverse as entertainment; and, with viewer ratings, turns ""folks"" like Charles Manson, Bonnie, and Clyde into celebrity stars. A decade later, Chris Hansen's ""To Catch a Predator"" proved media could sink even lower, by celebrating pedophilia. Woody Harrelson and Juliet Lewis are individually chilling and brave, in the lead roles; somehow, they aren't as memorable together as other criminal and/or degenerate couples (""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""Sid and Nancy""). Perhaps, their relative aloofness is intentional. Mr. Downey Jr. and Tom Sizemore are award-worthy, in their supporting roles; the former's portrayal is the best example of the film's uncomfortable resonation. Stone's soundtrack choices (Yo! Patti Smith) rock. The ""Nature/Nurture"" balance/influence on the film's anti-heroes is explained during the appropriately placed ""Super Bowl"" TV interview. ********* Natural Born Killers (8/26/94) Oliver Stone ~ Woody Harrelson, Juliet Lewis, Robert Downey Jr., Tom Sizemore",Natural Born Killers
14,BandSAboutMovies,Does it hold up?,5,21 July 2019,"What seemed subversive and important in 1994 feels silly and weightless today as I sit here, 25 years later. At one point - let's say 2006, when Entertainment Weekly published their list of the most controversial films in history, it placed eighth. I call BS on any list that doesn't list Salo and has Cannibal Holocaust at twenty.The movie started as a screenplay written by Quentin Tarantino. But back then, it was about a married couple going on a killing spree, and the future director would sell it for $10,000 after failing to direct it himself for $500,000. That's when Oliver Stone got it.It's obviously a Tarantino script, because Mickey Knox is named after Mickey Knox, who wrote the English dialogue for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West. Scagnetti is also the name of Mr. Blonde's probation officer in Reservoir Dogs.Stone rewrote the script, keeping much of the dialogue but focusing on the killers instead of the media. In truth, so much changed that Tarantino was only credited with the story. Originally, the producers saw it as an action movie, but once the 24-hour news cycle kicked in with O.J. Simpson, the Menendez brothers and the L.A. riots, all bets were off.Stone told Roger Ebert, ""When Quentin wrote those two characters, Mickey and Mallory, they were originally based on, I guess, Bonnie and Clyde. But he basically wrote a different movie than the one I've made. He wrote a very nice, clever take-off on an AIP picture with a '90's wryness. It was mostly about the TV journalist, and Mickey and Mallory were just sort of crazy, stick figures. It was a clever script but he didn't want to do it so he moved on to do Reservoir Dogs. I think he was hurt that I rewrote it so much. But I told him that I really can't make what he, as a 26-year-old, would make as a first film. As a 47-year-old filmmaker, it doesn't interest me. I want another level of socio-political comment and I want to deal with the whole justice system. I want to deal with the killers; where they come from, who their parents are. Quentin hasn't seen the movie, so who knows what he'll say?""He didn't have to wait all that long. Tarantino said, ""I hated that CENSORED movie. If you like my stuff, don't watch that movie.""It only took 56 days to shoot Natural Born Killer but nearly a year to edit it. What's left is a kinetic burst of energy that pretty much was what 1994 felt like.We start with Mickey Knox (Woody Harrelson, whose father once bragged from prison that he had killed JFK) and his wife Mallory (Juliette Lewis), who go from eating in a diner to murdering everyone inside it.We then flashback by way of a sitcom of their lives, where Mallory living in a home with her sexually abusive father (Rodney Dangerfield, who himself was verbally abused by a mother who never loved him, who was born Jacob Rodney Cohen but would become Jack Roy and then give up on comedy, who was married twice to a woman who never loved or respected him before reinventing himself as Rodney Dangerfield while never truly finding happiness, who wrote all of his own material for this film, who is one of my truest heroes), absentee mother (the fabulous Edie McClurg, a great character actor who shows up in Carrie and Eating Raoul) and her brother Kevin (Stone's son, Sean). Mickey breaks out of jail, kills her parents and they go on the road together.Sure, there are some problems along the way, like Mickey assaulting other women, but soon the happy couple has claimed fifty-two lives and is being hunted by Detective Jack Scagnetti (Tom Sizemore), whose mother was killed by Charles Whitman when he was just a kid, and tabloid journalist Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.), whose show American Maniacs turns them into heroes.Mickey and Mallory get lost in the desert and ingest mushrooms. Warren Red Cloud, a Native American mystic, senses a demon in Mickey and attempts to pull it from him, but the two end up killing him. It's the first murder they regret and soon, they've been bitten by numerous snakes and are caught in a drugstore.A year later, Mickey and Mallory are about to be transferred to a mental hospital when Waren Dwight McClusky (Tommy Lee Jones) tells Scagnetti that he has one chance to kill them both during the transfer. Meanwhile, Gale is planning a live interview with Mickey after the Super Bowl. Of course, all hell breaks loose and nearly everyone dies, save our heroes. Or villains.For as many people and things that ended up in the movie, tons ended up on the cutting room floor, including scenes with Ashley Judd, Denis Leary, Bret Hart and Peter and David Paul, who are The Barbarian Brothers (The Barbarians).Tarantino hated the final version of the film until a chance meeting with Johnny Cash, who told him that he and June were fans of his and loved the movie. Plus, once his original screenplay was published, he felt a little better, despite the quote above. For what it's worth, Steve Buscemi and Tim Roth both turned down the role of Wayne Gale because Tarantino would never have cast them in a movie ever again.The film led to so-called copycat killings including Columbine. Then, Oliver Stone and Time Warner were sued by Patsy Byers, with the support of author and producer John Grisham.How did that happen? In March 1995, eighteen-year-olds Sarah Edmondson and Benjamin Darras did acid and watched this movie, then were so inspired that they shot and paralyzed Byers and killed a cotton gin manager named William Savage who was a personal friend of Grisham.Grisham publicly accused Oliver Stone of being irresponsible, saying that he should be responsible for the actions of those inspired by his films. He used the laws of product liability to go after the director. The trial went the whole way until 2002, when it was finally dismissed by the Louisiana Court of Appeal.Before reviewing it for this week, I hadn't watched this film in twenty-some years. Hopefully, I can break that record before I see it again.",Natural Born Killers
15,michaelRokeefe,Oliver Stone masterpiece.,9,28 April 2009,"Not meant for the passive or comatose. Directed by Oliver Stone, this Quentin Tarantino story is high octane violence with super manic situations and little ability to be governed. Mickey(Woody Harrelson) and Mallory(Juliette Lewis), are star-crossed lovers obsessed with violence. They catch the nation's attention with a gory killing spree that begins with Mallory's dad(Rodney Dangerfield)and mom(Edie McClug). Society being sensation hungry as it is, fame is sustained by TV newsman Wayne Gale(Robert Downey Jr.)featuring the murderous duo constantly on his show, American Maniacs. My favorite scene is Mickey in prison telling a story with explicit hand gestures.Cinematography is hyper kinetic and switches back and forth between black-and-white, vivid animation and stark color. The story advances with rapid-fire delivery and brilliant editing. This film is not recommended for the faint of heart...the chaotic approach and disturbing images and subject matter alone make for a very strong R rating. Supporting cast includes: Tommy Lee Jones, Tom Sizemore, O-Lan Jones, Ed White and Pruitt Taylor Vince.",Natural Born Killers

17,Theo Robertson,""" Why Are They Making F***in` Stupid Movies "" ...",2,9 November 2003,"... asks Woody Harrelson`s character Mickey and was the one and only time in the movie I found myself agreeing with him . Not that NATURAL BORN KILLERS is a stupid movie - It`s worse than a stupid movie , it`s an egotistical one as Oliver Stone shows through one movie how many directing styles he learned at film school . It goes without saying that as a director he fails with this , the only exceptions being "" The Mallory home life sit com "" and the title sequence that features a pumping soundtrack , but it`s saying something when the impact of the film is down more to a Patti Smith track than the director . Oh and can anyone explain any contextual reasons for all the differing styles ?For a film that claims to be a satire the script lacks any type of intelligence , wit , or even satire , a problem I would have thought in a satirical film . The script can best be described as "" BONNIE AND CLYDE on acid "" which probably suits the "" MTV on cocaine "" type of directing . What`s the subtext ? Everyone has the capacity to be a killer ? Yeah like I`ve never seen an edition of the news or seen quiet guys - Girls too - go violently mad after a few drinks .

There also seems to be a bit of a flaw to the structure , you know that oft shown clip of people around the world praising Mickey and Mallory ?

18,Hey_Sweden,Get ready for the future: it is murder.,7,25 May 2012,"Director Oliver Stone's incredibly wild take on Quentin Tarantino's story is a candy store full of surreal images, soundtrack choices, film clips, newsreel footage, and satire. It's not going to be for every taste, as ultimately it's such an attack on the senses that it becomes a little numbing. It takes jabs at a number of aspects of pop culture, specifically the way that certain media types conduct themselves, how they and the public make celebrities out of criminals, and the utter fascination held for certain crazed individuals. Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis have two of the best roles of their careers as Mickey and Mallory, two lovers, each coming from traumatic backgrounds, who fatefully meet and celebrate their union by going on a spree of mass murder. Robert Downey, Jr. is Wayne Gale, the tabloid journalist with a sensational TV program who's determined to capitalize on their infamy. Tom Sizemore and Tommy Lee Jones contribute truly over the top supporting performances, and many familiar faces appear in roles both big and small. Stone experiments with all sorts of styles and goes for dutch angles at many different points, but there are times when the weirdness is reigned in somewhat and the story becomes more straightforward. Still, things get cranked up to a high level for the climactic prison riot, of which Mickey and Mallory take full advantage. Perhaps the oddest moment in the whole thing is the way that Mallory's demented home life is presented in the style of a sitcom, laugh track and everything, with none other than Rodney Dangerfield as her ultra creepy dad. (Director Stone's son Sean plays Mallory's brother in this sequence.) The tone is set right up front as Mickey and Mallory raise Hell in a diner and things stay, let's say, *interesting*, for about two hours. Particularly potent is the jail house interview with Mickey and Wayne, modelled after the Geraldo Rivera / Charles Manson interview. Of course, this also works as a love story - a thoroughly unconventional one - but a love story just the same, and after all the digs the movie takes at various subjects, it doesn't go for a safe, Hollywood style resolution. There are no ""good"" or purely ""bad"" characters here; everybody's got their flaws in this story. Continuing the tradition of law breaking lovers also portrayed in films such as ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""Badlands"", ""Natural Born Killers"" is definitely something one doesn't just watch but experience. And when it's all over, it's not something easily forgotten. Seven out of 10.",Natural Born Killers

His only film of note has been The People vs. Larry Flynt, and he doesn't impress me here. Juliette Lewis doesn't have an impressive resume either, but she fits the part of Mallory to a T. Whether she is Mickey's (Harrelson) partner, or the daughter of the lecherous Rodney Dangerfield, she fits in the ro9le.What is impressive about this film is Ston'e direction. The changes from black and white to color, and the addition of the cartoons at critical points makes this film more a work of art than just a film about killers and the media. In addition, Robert Richardson's cinematography was brilliant.Tommy Lee Jones as the warden was brilliant, and Robert Downey Jr. put in the best performance Ihave seen from him.In an age of Paris Hilton coverage from dusk to dawn, this film about the media is not to be missed.",Natural Born Killers
21,Boba_Fett1138,The most tripping movie ever made.,10,21 July 2008,"If you don't want to take drugs but still want to experience a tripping experience, ""Natural Born Killers"" is the perfect alternative solution.There is no holding back Oliver Stone in this one. Oliver Stone movies of course often feature weird camera angles, extreme editing and cuts and at times dream like atmosphere but ""Natural Born Killers"" really goes to the extreme. The cuts are extreme, making this one fast hell of a ride, with dream (or better said nightmare) like images. Oliver Stone used all of his tricks, by using many different film formats, old stock footage and random images and animated sequences in between. This all ensures the movie its constant hallucinative look and feeling. It's comical, it's violent, it's odd but yet it also remains to know perfectly accessible to everyone.It has a story (originally written by Quentin Tarantino) that is filled with violence. It's about a psychotic couple on a killing spree and we mostly get to see things the way they experience them. It makes us close to the main characters, despite their extremely violent nature. They are like a modern Bonnie & Clyde. But the story is of course about a lot more of things, going into many different directions, mainly concerning how violent hungry the world has become, especially concerning its media, as gets perfectly depicted by sensationalist reporter Wayne Gale, played by Robert Downey Jr.Quite ironic of course that Robert Downey Jr. plays in such a tripping movie, considering his drug past. Same goes for Tom Sizemore. Both must had had no difficulties coming into character and capturing the right mood of the movie with their performances. Besides those two, the movie has many other different great actors in supporting roles. Tommy Lee Jones is of course especially memorable in his totally crazy role as the prison warden Dwight McClusky. The movie further more also features Rodney Dangerfield, O-Lan Jones and Dale Dye among many, many others.But despite having many great and well known actors in it, the movie still gets mostly carried by it's two main principal actors, Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis. They are actually really a cute couple together in this movie, as weird as this might sound, considering all these things they are doing in this movie.One of my favorite movies of the '90's.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Natural Born Killers
22,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Cinematic excellence,10,7 November 2004,"I haven't seen too many Oliver Stone pictures; JFK, Scarface(which he wrote, not directed), and this one. I don't know too much about his directorial style, but if any of his other films are like this one, I'll have to watch more of them. The visual style is amazing. The whole film has sort of a psychedelic visual style, and utilizes constant cuts and constant change in color scheme, often changing between powerful green, blue, red and even black/white. Of course, none of this is random. It's there to project symbolism and keep the mood intense and constantly evolving, and, believe me, it works perfectly. With many references to popular media(television, mainly), demons and the desensitizing effect of television. The effect of half of the imagery being seen through a television screen or hallucinated is amazing. The film is experimental and psychological. As Stone puts it in the documentary, it's a film about two people breaking the rules, so it's only fitting that the film-makers are also breaking the rules. It's chaotic and wild, insane and mentally exhausting. It's a film about pain, violence and giving in to cravings and desires. But it in no way romanticizes the aforementioned three points. Quite the opposite. I believe someone once told me that the film makes killing and violence look appealing. I can't even explain how wrong that is. This truly is an amazing film. If you can sit through this, and you (honestly) think of yourself as perceptive and intelligent, you have to see this movie. It's not just recommended or a good idea to watch, it's mandatory for anyone that 'get' it. The plot is great and well-paced. It's never boring. The acting is great. The characters are well-written, credible and so easy to understand and sympathize with that many will hate the film for it. The whole film is amazing on so many levels. I recommend it to any person who believes himself or herself to be hardened and intelligent enough to sit through it, and, more importantly, understand it. I recommend you get the directors cut, as it keeps everything that the other released version cut off. Highly recommendable. 10/10",Natural Born Killers
23,view_and_review,True Romance Part 2,6,17 August 2020,"I loved this movie when I was younger. Back then I had no cares and no responsibilities, so the idea of a ruthless Bonnie & Clyde type couple just going around senselessly killing appealed to me. Now I watch it like: WTF?I still like the individual characters. Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) were something. I loved Warden Dwight McClusky (Tommy Lee Jones), the warden at the prison MIckey and Mallory were housed. And Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.), the Aussie Geraldo, was great. If there could be a movie with all of those personalities minus the extreme violence, then that'd be a wonderful movie.The imagery and violence was so hyperbolized that I can only think it was done to see if it was possible to offend the sensibilities of the public. It was almost like: ""I bet we can make a movie about two depraved mass killers who kill wantonly and people will love it."" And that's what they did, and people loved it--including a 17-y/o me.

The media embraces the sensation thanks to the hype driven by a program called ""American Maniacs"", hosted to great enthusiasm by Wayne Gale.

In this case he wrote Natural Born Killers, a story that is completely his style, a style that not everybody will like but I think most people know by now whether they like his stories or movies, or not, so watching this movie if you don't like Tarantino is just a waste of your time. The movie is directed by Oliver Stone, which is kind of a guarantee to be special and succesful. The cinematography is excellent, it's sometimes overwhelming but that's a good thing. The combination of movie and cartoon was clever and artful. The story is violence from the beginning till the end, which is kinda obvious with a movie title like that so don't complain about that if you don't like it. As for the acting it was what to expect with such a great cast. Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis are perfect in their roles. Juliette Lewis is one of my favorite actresses, almost everything she does is just good, expect her personal life choice as a member of the delusional scientologists which is completely crazy and unattractive. It's very disappointing for her fans, but she's still a wonderful actress nonetheless, she's just not marriage material. Robert Downey Jr. had a bit of an annoying character in this movie so I wasn't a fan. But the rest of the cast was just great and contributed in making this movie a cult movie.

As it is all begins well and as we get used to the fragmented and imaginative style and hectic pace both Juliette Lewis and Woody Harrelson seem in fine form. The TV sitcom spoof halts the film in its tracks. This is no longer going to be a freewheeling extravaganza, somebody wants to make a point. Director Stone just cannot resists the opportunity to explain how things turn out the way they do and what we all do wrong. By the time we get to the prison we are bored of the delinquent pair, embarrassed at the awful accent, overacting and 'satirical' element of Robert Downey Jr's role only to gasp at the craziness of the comic book screaming of Tommy Lee Jones.

29,namashi_1,Oliver Stone surpasses himself in this wacky fare....,9,1 November 2009,"'Natural Born Killers' is a controversial satirical crime film directed by Oliver Stone, about a husband and wife pair of mass murderers and the media coverage given to them. This 1994 flick is amongst Legendary Filmmaker Oliver Stone's finest works.Quentin Tarantino's story has been executed amazingly by Stone. I've seen 'Natural Born Killers' way back, but yet this flick haunts me for it's horribly violent sequences & it's grabbing narrative. Everything looks so real, that you can't afford to but hate Mickey and Mallory Knox.The performances are power-packed: Robert Downey, Jr. is the life of 'Natural Born Killers'. He plays the reporter amazingly, and yes the way he gets killed it's indeed depressing and funny at the same time. Woody Harrelson is excellent as Mickey, and so is Juliette Lewis as Mallory. Both get into the skin of their characters, and deliver memorable performances. Tommy Lee Jones as the Warden is hilarious. His intro is indeed clap-worthy. Others are passable.On the whole, 'Natural Born Killers' will always be one of my all-time favorite films. Two Big Thumbs Up!",Natural Born Killers
30,JamesHitchcock,Natural Born Trash,2,16 April 2009,"Although I may occasionally disagree with Oliver Stone's politics, the likes of ""Wall Street"" and ""Heaven and Earth"" show that he is capable of making good films. Unfortunately, ""Natural Born Killers"" shows that he is equally capable of making bad ones.Stone's protagonists are a young married couple, Mickey and Mallory Knox, who go on a killing spree across the American South-West, murdering over fifty people. They are eventually arrested and imprisoned, but later break out of jail and resume their killings. The film is (very loosely) based on the Starkweather-Fugate case of the 1950s which also inspired Terrence Malick's ""Badlands"", and is also influenced by Arthur Penn's ""Bonnie and Clyde"", although Stone's film does not really deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as either Malick's or Penn's.To say that I disliked the film would be an understatement; I loathed it, for two main reasons. The first is stylistic. The film is shot and edited in a frenzied style, with Stone employing just about every stylistic trick in the book, including frequent switches between colour and black and white footage, unusual camera angles, the use of filters to give unnatural colour schemes, animation sequences, rapid cross-cutting and the brief insertion of images unrelated to the plot or the film's subject-matter. The section dealing with the relationship between Mallory and her dysfunctional family (her parents end up as two of the couple's victims) is done in the style of a 1950s-type sitcom called ""I Love Mallory"" (clearly based on ""I Love Lucy""), complete with canned laughter and closing credits.None of these devices are bad in themselves; indeed, they can often be used to great effect. (Think, for example, of Woody Allen's use of animated sequences in ""Annie Hall""). Penn used innovative editing techniques in the final death scene in ""Bonnie and Clyde"", cutting between images shot from different angles at different speeds. The trouble with ""Natural Born Killers"" is that the whole film is shot using this technique. What in Penn's film was a special effect, designed to give particular emotional emphasis to its closing scene, becomes in Stone's film his standard modus operandi, dissipating its effect. ""Ars est celare artem"" said the Romans- the art is to hide the art, or perhaps the technique is to hide the technique. Stone is not interested in hiding his stylistic gimmicks, but rather thrusts them to the centre of the stage, shouting ""Look at me! I'm an auteur! This is what we auteurs do!"" Technique here detracts from the film's storyline and message rather than advancing them- in fact the technique actually becomes the message.My other reason for loathing this film has to do with Stone's attitude to violence. Those who criticise the film are often accused by its defenders of ""missing the point"". With all due respect, this is a film where it is virtually impossible to miss the point. Even if Stone had not stated in numerous interviews that his aim was to satirise the way in which the media glamorises violent crime, the film itself shrieks that message at you from the rooftops. The principal representative of the media seen in the film is television journalist Wayne Gale, who hosts a sensationalist show called ""American Maniacs"", and who is chiefly responsible for turning Mickey and Mallory into celebrities. Gale is so fascinated by the couple that he even assists them in their jailbreak, only to become one of their victims when they turn on him. Satire is also aimed at the law enforcement and justice systems themselves, personified by violent and corrupt cop Jack Scagnetti and violent and corrupt Prison Warden Dwight McClusky.Stone's treatment of the subject was influenced by the fact that his film came out shortly after several highly-publicised celebrity trials, including those of O.J. Simpson and Tonya Harding. Now, it is undoubtedly true that the media are sometimes guilty of glamorising or sensationalising, crime, although in fairness to journalists and broadcasters I should point out that the word ""media"" also includes the cinema and that Hollywood has always been at least as guilty of this sin as the press and television. I should perhaps also point out that on occasions the media are guilty of the opposite sin, that of demonising the innocent rather than glamourising the guilty. (Much to the disappointment of sections of the media, Simpson was acquitted by the jury and Harding also walked free after the more serious accusations against her were dropped). Stone's satire, however, is of the heavy-handed, sledgehammer variety, so over the top that it generally misses all its targets, especially as all his characters are grossly exaggerated caricatures. Robert Downey Jr's Gayle, for example, is such a booby that it is hard to take him seriously as journalist, even at the most downmarket and sensationalist end of that profession. None of those who appear in the film, including Downey, Tommy Lee Jones, Juliette Lewis or Woody Harrelson, can be said thereby to have enhanced their reputations.Moreover, Stone might criticise the media for glamourising murder, but he is not entirely innocent himself in that respect, falling into the trap of becoming the thing that he is satirising. Mickey and Mallory are a cool, attractive young couple who specialise in shooting people who are neither cool not attractive- abusive fathers, rednecks, ethnic minorities. The only murder about which they feel any remorse is that of the old Indian shaman, about whom Mallory exclaims, ""You killed life!"", implying that he was worthy of living whereas their previous victims were not. A young man exclaims about them ""I'm not a serial killer, but if I were I'd be Mickey and Mallory!"" The film ends with the couple killing Gayle, thereby symbolically killing the media, and escaping to a life of freedom. This was the film which Stone described as ""ultimately a very optimistic film about the future"". Who's glorifying violence now? 2/10",Natural Born Killers
31,Smells_Like_Cheese,What the hell was Oliver thinking?!,3,14 August 2001,"First off, this movie is a gigaintic music video. Very poor acting. And I didn't see Mallory as a sick twisted girl who just got treated unfairly in life. And Mickey was just plain stupid and sick. Both Mickey and Mallory were very sadistic and should of gotten killed in this movie. It could still be a good movie, but needs a lot of improvement.3/10",Natural Born Killers
32,MovieAddict2016,You'll love it or hate it.,7,4 May 2005,"I remember ""Natural Born Killers"" making a huge fuss when it was released because the media and conservative families were in an outrage over the level of ""glorified violence"" in the film. To some extent they were right -- the violence isn't glorified but much of it is unnecessary. The movie could still be a brilliant satire of society/the media without going into such graphic detail -- it's been proved in cinema before that sometimes seeing less is better than gratuity. If Oliver Stone's movie has one outstanding flaw, it's the lack of subtlety.That said, if you can handle the level of violence and take it tongue-in-cheek, ""Natural Born Killers"" is so bizarre and funny that it's worth the ""trip."" (Pun intended.) This is a crazy drug odyssey that would have made Hunter S. Thompson look like Ronald Reagan. The film is twisted, outlandish and out of its mind -- Oliver Stone has gone stone-cold crazy and it's awesome.Despite my reservations about his lack of subtlety, there is a flip side to the coin: It is a story about excess. Stone's film-making has gone somewhat awry over the years (look at the pointless excess of his films after this), but this fits the bill because it IS a story of excess.Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis play the titular ""Natural Born Killers,"" Mickey and Mallory, a pair of crazy serial killers who both suffered traumatic childhoods and are now rampaging America on a literal killing spree.After they are finally apprehended, the media has by now turned them into such icons and glorified personalities that the public and media seems to respect them as titans of filth.This is where the social satire of the film comes into play, essentially saying: We focus more on the killers than the heroes.I do think it's a bit hypocritical of Oliver Stone to attempt to point this out, as he is a die-hard liberal at his core and, as the controversy surrounding this film's release proved, the conservatives are too conservative to praise killers. It seems to be the liberal media that glorifies violence (to some extent of course) so I thought Stone would be the last person to ever criticize the media.So yes it does come across as somewhat of a moot point but nevertheless the film is still enjoyable despite its sometimes sickening amount of over-the-top violence (the opening sequence of the Director's Cut is stomach-turning).The cast is superb - Rodney Dangerfield, Robert Downey Jr., Tommy Lee Jones, Tom Sizemore, Edie McClurg (the rental car agent from ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" and Rooney's assistant in ""Ferris Bueller""!) and Denis Leary and Ashley Judd in deleted scenes included in the Director's Cut.The story was conceived by Quentin Tarantino (and it's very similar to his ""True Romance"" script -- a sort of modern-day ""Bonnie and Clyde Redux"") and re-written by Stone (much to the chagrin of QT). I'm not sure which would have made for a better film but, despite its flaws (which are mainly a none-too-subtle message and too much violence), ""Natural Born Killers"" is a sort of bizarre, outlandish masterpiece of drugged-out cinema. --",Natural Born Killers
33,Red-Barracuda,A visual tour de force but not exactly entertaining,7,4 March 2011,"I don't really know truly what to make of Natural Born Killers. I have given it a quite generous rating but I can't say I enjoy it all that much. I guess I feel that it deserves some credit for its relentless editing and visual invention. I appreciate that this filming style was no doubt used as a means of depicting its two anti-heroes in a banal MTV-style way. But it was well done and does give the film a look that is undeniably memorable. The actual content of the film does leave me cold though. It is a satire, no doubt about that, but it's hard going at times, seeing as it's characters are all cardboard and intentionally lacking in any real depth. So empathy is out the window.As a violent crime film, it doesn't register very much as it's always obvious that Oliver Stone is continually making a statement about how the U.S. media glamorizes serial killers. So it doesn't take thriller principles at all seriously and is certainly far more of a (black) comedy than anything else. It has to be said though that on occasion the satire is bang on and original, such as the sitcom segments depicting Mallory's home life with the canned laughter and the hypocrisy of bleeping out swearing while showing everything else; Rodney Dangerfield is great here in an extremely unpleasant role. As I said before, I give credit where credit's due for the aesthetical look of the film and its occasional moments of inspiration.

34,cherold,"starts okay, doesn't stay there",3,28 October 2003,"I thought the first hour of Natural Born Killers was decent.  The movie clearly wanted to be some sort of fever dream contemplation of celebrity worship, and while there's little wisdom and no subtlety, the film has an engaging hyperkinetic energy and some entertaining set pieces that make it fairly entertaining as it hammers home its trite points about the media.  At times one could almost say the movie is cool in a sort of MTV-video way, even if it does always feel a bit false.  At pretty much exactly the halfway point though, NBK runs out of ideas.  I don't mean it runs low on ideas, I mean it is out of them entirely, giving us essentially an hour of noise and blood without a single idea worth considering.  Whatever grudging good will I had towards the film evaporated while sitting through the utterly tedious second half.

35,FeastMode,unique and artistic,7,24 June 2019,"Pretty awesome, especially for an old movie. very unexpected and different. They were beasts and I was rooting for the killers to win (2 viewings, 4/28/2020)",Natural Born Killers
36,ElMaruecan82,"I have no doubt about Stone's intent but sometimes, the film's too showy for its own good...",8,15 April 2020,"""Natural Born Killers"" provides the kind of intellectual challenge no critic, amateur or pro, can refuse. It has so much to tell, so much to show and (oh yeah) so much to comment on that it's almost impossible to cover every ground without missing a few spots. So any attempt to condensate a reaction into a 1000-word review, either to praise it or to tear it into pieces, will be partial and unsatisfying, which is already a credit to Oliver Stone's thought-provoking script. I honestly don't know how much of Tarantino's original draft survived the adaptation but since he disowned the story, it's only ""fair"" to treat Stone as the sole author.And yet even Stone complained that the released version was butchered and the parts that landed on the cutting room floor could have enhanced his personal statement against media frenzy. So while I'm aware that one missing minute can deconstruct the meaning, I'll still base my review on the shown rather than the intended; starting with the obvious: the film is about Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallaury Knox (Juliette Lewis), a couple of killers. They love each other fiercely, madly, insanely with the same level of demonic passion inhabiting them during their killing spree across America's Midwest.But they're no Bonnie and Clyde and certainly no modern Robin Hoods. They kill and they enjoy killing, it's almost an artistic endeavor with their ""works"" carrying the same signature: killing first and leaving one witness to tell the cops, then the media, then the people. They have no redeemable value whatsoever but they have ""style"" and their screen chemistry is so palpable that it seems to catch the eye of the camera. Or are the lenses so enamored with them they make them look so stylish... or cool? To any scholar protesting against Hollywood glorification of violence, a film like ""Natural Born Killers"" is the perfect target.How dare Stone edit gruesome and merciless killings as if they were to MTV clips! What a nerve intercutting them with images borrowed from random images: excerpts from ads, from Stone's scripted films like ""Midnight Express"" or ""Scarface"", animal documentaries, World War II footage or sometimes the same image shot in every possible format (black and white, amateur, seen from TV, 8 or 16mm and so forth) even the vertiginous editing of ""JFK"" feels boringly linear in comparison with ""Natural Born Killers"".Aesthetically, the film is so visually extravagant that it feels like Stone felt intoxicated with the whole madness surrounding him, recalling three key characters who know one thing or two about maniacs: Tom Sizemore as the man who arrest them, Tommy Lee Jones the man who keeps them behind bars and Robert Downey Jr. who's dedicated a whole TV show to them. Apparently, you can't deal with maniacs without embracing their insanity but unlike cops and wardens, journalists are agents of transmission, they have more responsibility and their handling of criminals contribute to our desensitization, trivialization or our ""sensationalization"" of the worst, for the sake of entertainment.It was a French TV Channel CEO who said: ""our mission is to provide Coca Cola enough brain availability"". In the middle of a shocking interview, Stone gratifies us with the Christmas polar bear ad that illustrates the statement, reminding us of the way images of death and hunger are sometimes mixed with indecent calls for consumerism. The power of TV is to be an attention-seeker, a meaning-giver and a fascination-builder, camera provides -if not a meaning- an access to posterity, the Knoxs know it just as Manson, Whitman the perpetrators of high-school or mass shootings knew. In his diatribe against media, Stone doesn't go for nuance and strikes very hard, galvanized by the very power of imagery he condemns. The catch is that his attempt to question the 'natural' aspect of violence isn't as strong and insightful as the cultural one.Mickey Knox believes that within the demon that inhabits us, there's a call for murder, like for the wolf or the rattlesnake. In the end, it's debatable whether civilization is the poison that endorses violence (totalitarian regimes are examples) or the antidote. After all, the rattlesnake is used by an old Native to explain the nature of deadly animals but it's also the symbol of the medical world. Nature, like the media according to Stone, seems like the easy scapegoat for the Knox couple, they never take full responsibility for their actions, they're just true to the purest and deepest expression of human form and that's where I feel the film sins a little.To put it simply, the film's showy when it accuses the media, too subtle when it comes to accuse the Knoxs. It's indeed convenient that Mickey invokes the laws of nature when he insisted on having a wedding ceremony, a staple of human civilization. Take also one of the most applauded scenes in the film: the sitcom parody where Rodney Dangerfield steals the show as the abusive father who sowed the first seeds of violence through his behavior. Didn't Mickey deliver meat with clothes all covered with beef blood. How evocative of Mother Nature are meat factories?The sitcom part is here to highlight the way media are literally brainwashing the audience and sugarcoating the material but the blood in Mickey's is also indicative of his own hypocrisy. But that's a detail easily overlooked in a film where the whole media-driven civilization is being accused. And that's the problem with the film: there's always. a fine line of what the film shows and what it tells. Stone shows the way society becomes a catalyst for violence, the media helping, the problem is that all his editing and stylish directing ironically uses the same tricks than TV, and creating such a maze of a film that the responsibility of Knoxs and the fallacious nature of their so-called obedience to the laws of Nature, is easily missed.",Natural Born Killers
37,paul2001sw-1,The dream life of devils,3,21 November 2006,"Oliver Stone has made many films of some merit, but this merit is often drowned amid background noise; Stone simply doesn't do quiet. Quentin Tarentino has made some brilliantly clever movies, often featuring a deliberate lack of restraint that sometimes makes one gasp in admiration, but which sometimes seems utterly gratuitous. Put them together, as in this film (which Tarentino scripted, and Stone directed), and unfortunately the result is not a masterpiece, but a film that appears to be all gratuitous noise and very little else. Superficially, the film is a satirical attack on the media celebration of serial killers, not unlike the Belgian film 'Man Bites Dog'; except that the film is a celebration of them itself; and except for the further fact that the whole movie is so over-the-top in every way that in fact, a word like satire is simply rendered meaningless. The result is certainly vivid, and the imagery that Stone marshals seems to hint at some kind of intended political message, but what we actually get to see is more like a drug-addled nightmare. I have to admit, I didn't really get the point of this movie, and Robert Downey Junior's hyperactive character is virtually unwatchable. Perhaps it's just too clever for me; but I suspect, it's simply a lot less clever (and a hell of a lot less funny) than it thinks it is.",Natural Born Killers
38,bowmanblue,Probably not as controversial as you've heard,8,14 July 2021,"Back in the nineties, and Quentin Tarantino's name was the epitome of 'cool' and 'hip' film-making, the prospect of another of his films coming out (after both the much hyped 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction') was almost too much to handle. Yes, there were many who pointed out that - technically - 'Natural Born Killers' was not actually one of his films were he did all the writing, producing and directing, but, as it has his name attached, none of us cared.Then it got banned. Apparently, it was too violent for the general public and its depiction of serial killers randomly executing innocent people would turn us easily-influenced viewers into the monsters we saw onscreen. All it really did was make us want to watch it even more.Back then we were forced to watch it on, er, 'less official' means which certainly could never live up to the experience of seeing it on the big screen, or even on your own TV (properly). Therefore, everyone enjoyed it - despite it being blurred, juddery and a terrible picture. No one dared say anything other than it was a 'masterpiece.'Luckily, these days, 'Natural Born Killers' is available to buy on most good DVD sellers online and you can see it in all its glory (albeit on the small screen). Plus, without the 'mythos' surrounding its release, you can relax, sit back and actually watch it with a little more of a neutral head on. Yes, it's still a good film, but probably not one you'd watch often.Two killers: Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Malory (Juliette Lewis) go on a killing spree and that's about it. Yes, there are plenty of people who see the story as some type of satirical take on the American way of life and try to read 'deeper' meaning into the story. It's one of those films that probably hard to truly recommend. Yes, there's plenty of grotesque and uncalled for violence. And, rather than Tarantino directing, Oliver Stone takes the chair and gives us one hell of a psychedelic trippy ride, using every directing trick in the book in order to give the feeling that you've been taking every illegal drug possible before you sat down to watch.There's plenty of famous faces on the cast list, not just the main two, but expect Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Downey Jr also chewing up the scenery, really giving us 'cartoonish' impersonations of cold-hearted - yet supposedly good - characters.Is it a masterpiece? Well, it's definitely not your normal 'Classic Hollywood' film. If you're in the mood for something very different to everything else that's on Netflix these days then it will certainly make you think Just make sure you have a strong stomach when it comes to excessive violence, swearing and generally bad people getting away with things.",Natural Born Killers
39,g-bodyl,Crazy Movie!,8,24 June 2013,"Natural Born Killers is one of the most craziest movies I have ever seen and one of the most interesting uses of cinematic techniques used in film. This film has a Quentin Taratino vibe to it and it almost feels as if he directed it. The film also has a message to it portraying the media as an organization who glorifies mass murder and makes it acceptable to all the young Americans. Cinematic-wise, I really enjoyed the lighting and stock footage and they made this film less conventional.Oliver Stone's film is about a husband and wife murder gang and the movie follows their tale from the beginning as the media begins to take hold of these cold-blooded murderers and show them to the public in a positive way.The acting is really good. Woody Harrelson put himself onto the map with his blood-lust role and he was superb. Juliette Lewis made a name for herself in the 1990's and this film is one of the reasons why. Downey Jr, as with most films, is the heart and soul and had some funny scenes. Tommy Lee Jones also does no wrong in his warden role.Overall, this is a fun, bloody film that may have a true message or two. It's different than most films and it reminds me of Taratino. However, if Taratino directed this, we may have even gotten a better film. The movie is not for those of faint heart because there is plenty of violence and blood. I'm quite shocked critics did not receive this film well. I rate this film 8/10.",Natural Born Killers
40,secondtake,"Dazzling, with great acting, unbridled editing, and style to the hilt...",9,23 December 2010,"Natural Born Killers (1994)The one two punch of Tarantino writing and Stone directing, and a swagger from both of their recent successes, makes this a crazy memorable and slightly indulgent (or not so slightly) showpiece.To be sure, this movie lacks elegance. It can't be elegant and chaotic at the same time, I suppose, but there is a kind of artlessness to all the artiness. But truly, the effect of all these effects, the shifting imagery, the surreal layering, the slightly asynchronous parallel editing between black and white and color, the symbolism (snakes are big), and lights and the frantic camera-work, all of this is overwhelming in the best way.And there are the two leads, for starters, both rather perfect at being white trash badass heartless romantics. Woody Harrelson is snide and smart and unflustered as the man who kills almost to show that killing is possible and so therefore why not, a kind of power trip but with no interest in really using the power. Juliette Lewis is layered and wary and deceptive as the woman who kills as a kind of abstract revenge for a bad childhood and abusive father, but who pushes this beyond revenge into a kind of self-satisfied glee.Yes, these are killers beyond real life killers, a parody that steps just barely beyond what is reasonable. Not that serial killers are reasonable, or have boundaries. But as if to prove that everyone is too much to believe (and therefore fun to watch), Robert Downy Jr. is an obsessed television producer, and Tom Sizemore is a slightly psychotic researcher into psychoses. Both push their limits, and ours, as they pursue the two killers. The movie is horrifying, if you take it literally. It's disgusting, even, or just so insensitive it's sick. But I found myself laughing with appreciation through most of it. I don't mean the Rodney Dangerfield parts, where he is a ham as usual (and an ugly one), but in parts where Lewis is deflecting in her insouciant way, or where Harrelson analyzes something with some absurdism that actually seems just about right. And it colorizes the whole notion that our culture nurtures these kinds of anti-heroes through the superficial media--think of Charles Manson (who never directly killed anyone, by the way). Is the movie good? Well yes, by any measure, it has so much audacity and originality, and some great acting, it's good. But it does stretch its first hour and a half thin, so that the core idea or two is repeated and to some extent made secondary to the effects, and some of the crazy dialog. Once you get to the prison scenes, it perks up and goes ballistic, just in time.A classic of its time, whatever its flaws. I wish Tarantino had directed, actually, because it might have had more velocity all through, and more elegance. But then, it's not a lyrical subject, is it? No, it's a brutal, jagged world portrayed appropriately. Watch it with some aesthetic detachment.",Natural Born Killers
41,Irishchatter,My head is spinning from seeing this yesterday....,10,12 May 2015,"I literally got a headache after looking at this movie yesterday afternoon in which I still do today. I wouldn't suggest to anyone looking at this at night because you won't be sleeping until sunrise! I would mostly recommend watching this during the daytime so that you would get a good night sleep. It would be better then thinking about hearing gunshots in your head for the rest of the day . It worked for me however it mightn't work for some. Everyone's different!Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis were honestly the best actors at playing extreme psychopaths. It would really pull you to the world of what an actual serial killers thoughts and emotions are like. I find it extremely sad that their characters had rough childhoods. I was so shocked when Rodney Dangerfield appeared as the abusive father, he looked too lovable to play the character. He was an excellent actor at the same time!I honestly loved Robert Downey Jr, his fake Australian accent was so awesome! Not many American actors can do the Australian accent too well but he was unbelievable. I wish he used it more often then the American accent haha. I even loved his attitude as a crazy journalist, he just would hurt your jaws from laughter of his goofiness! Great actor and he doesn't need to be known as Iron Man to prove it!With Tommy Lee Jones, man he had that 'bad guy' attitude, you wouldn't want to be messing with him! I've never actually seen him too angry before like before this movie, I only knew the dude in Men in Black so after seeing this movie, I'll not forget him in this either! Great movie to watch but don't show this to kids, it can get pretty freaky and ugly!",Natural Born Killers
42,callanvass,Brilliant Just Brilliant!,10,24 March 2005,"This was a brilliant movie just brilliant, with 2 fantastic performances from Woody Harrelson, and Juliette Lewis. It has some bizarre imagery, and it's quite powerful at times, the finale,is especially crazy!, Stone goes all out here.The only tiny qualm i have is The 1st Half is a bit stronger then the 2nd, but the 2nd half is still engrossing, especially the last 30 to 40 minutes!. This movie is not for everyone's taste, and many may be turned off by it, but i loved it, and will be buying the DVD eventually!. It's especially well written by Tarantino, and all the characters rocked, plus the chemistry between Juliette and Woodi is fantastic!. The Direction is Fantastic!. Oliver Stone does a fantastic job here, creating tons of bizarre images, great use of colors, and some shots that just blew me away,great use of black and white plus it's extremely stylish, and he kept the movie at a very fast pace!, awesome job. This movie is extremely bloody. We get, Hundreds!!!! of extremely bloody gunshot wounds, gory flashes, 2 bloody gunshot wounds to the head with blood and brains splattering, bloody stabbings, slicing and dicing, headless corpse, slit throat, hole shot through hand,blood everywhere and TONS and tons of blood splashes. The Acting is amazing!. Woody Harrelson, is outstanding here!, i never knew he was this talented, he gives an outstanding, creepy performance here, he had amazing chemistry with Juliette Lewis, and shocked the hell out of me with his outstanding performance. Juliette Lewis is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS!, and gives an AMAZING performance here, i always thought she was a very talented actress, so this is one of her best performances!. Rodney Dangerfield, is amusing as Mallory's's dad. Robert Downey Jr., got on my nerves, but he had a few moments where he amused me as the reporter, but he totally over did it. Tom Sizemore, is good as the weasel detective. Tommy Lee Jones, is good here, he is an awesome actor. Overall a MUST see, regardless!, and in my opinion it's a classic! ***** out of 5",Natural Born Killers

The media soon turn this sick romance into the main sensation, and the pair of brutal psychopaths into cult anti-heroes.This controversial achievement of Oliver Stone was blamed for inspiring real-life murders and I do not doubt that there is some truth in it, but it's so damn fun to watch. 35mm, Super-8, animation, back projection, fast color-switching, black & white, skewed camera angles, quick-cut editing, loud rock soundtrack, and various special effects make it a superb adrenaline roller-coaster. Why should you see it? Because this film is already a matter of general culture. Why should you love it? Because the original script was written by Tarantino, because Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, and Robert Downey Jr. nailed the lead roles, because you will listen to the music of Leonard Cohen, Lou Reed, Bob Dylan, NIN, RATM, Manson, because it is extremely entertaining and simply awesome in every way possible.10/10",Natural Born Killers

In fact, it soon goes downhill with a cheesy sitcom sketch that is meant to be clever but falls flat. This is perhaps the worst movie ever made by an Oscar-winning director, as Stone is at his self-indulgent worst, utilizing such cheesy tricks as tilted camera angles, random use of black and white cinematography, movies playing in the windows of houses, and animation.

46,Dr_Coulardeau,Killing is a social trained fatality and curse,9,16 January 2007,"This film is both cultish and scandalous, if not horrifying. A standard viewer in a standard audience would react along three main lines according to their belief whether the film is a true story or not. Imagine two young people who in three weeks killed fifty-two people. And it all ends in a prison riot and a prison break that leaves dozens of people dead in the prison. I will stick to the director's cut and its official ending, not the alternative ending. In this official ending the couple survives after their prison break by getting underground and lives a long happy life with something like three children, the whole family living in a mobile-home moving from mobile-home camp to mobile-home camp and you can imagine if they moved often they would not attract too much attention and could easily blend into the American landscape, social or not.The first reactive line would be: ""It is a true story and it is a frightening fact that such people do exist in our society and they get to killing dozens of people if they can on a very regular basis."" The feeling then is a feeling of fear, the simple fear that one day you may find yourself in a public place where such a mass killer would turn up and start shooting. But let me be clear: that is NOT terrorism. That is pure mass killing and the causes are not some political or even social objective. It is the result of a mentally deranged psyche and that deranged person has been through various causes evoked in the film: disrupted family, unemployment, family violence from the father, alcoholism, very often abuse from one parent onto the children, boys or girls indifferently, father or mother indifferently too, and at times the monetization of this abuse onto the children with outside grown- ups paying for the opportunity. And you have to keep in mind in such a situation a child who needs contact, physical contact and love will accept anything that will provide him or her with that contact and that love, even if it is more rape and exploitation than love. How can he or she know?The second reactive line would be: ""It's a true story and our police is ineffective to stop such criminals, when they are white at least, and the people I work with or I meet in the street or who just go along in the street might be such sick killers ready to start again anytime."" Here fear is amplified by the obvious ineffectiveness of the police to protect me, you, us all against such sick people who find pleasure in killing other people including children. This is paranoia for such viewers of such films, but this paranoia is quite justified in real life, even if such crimes are marginal, even if we take into account terrorism which is nothing but mass killing with a political, religious or ideological dressing. Mass killers, particularly terrorist mass killers do not survive nowadays: they explode themselves or kill themselves after doing their ""business""; they are killed on the spot during the attack by some security force; or they are killed in the manhunt that follows their escape. In such situation the police seem to generalize the attitude of theirs towards Black offenders: Kill first, even with five bullets like in Saint Louis in 2011, and ask questions later, if you have any time to waste. So you can imagine the fear of viewers who know some of these mass criminals or mass murderers do survive and get underground.Watching such movies for people who are slightly paranoid on the subject of mass murderers, serial killers, or mass criminals is like people who are prone to experiencing vertigo in some situations and who cross the Grand Canyon on a flimsy pedestrian rope bridge, if possible on a windy day and looking down over the ropes, or between their legs to the river a few hundred yards lower. But it takes all sorts of fearful people to feed the paranoia of our consumer society.The third line is to know this film is fictional and then the fear is only short lived and the end of the film will give a tremendous relief with a big sigh: ""That sure was a good film. I nearly wet myself. But let's get an ice cream cone to push the film down."" That's why fiction is so useful: to provide people with fears and other emotions that they might never experience for real in humdrum everyday life.But, surprise, surprise! The film was an obvious fictional story based on a real couple of mass murderers. ""The horrific murder spree of Charles Starkweather and his fourteen-year-old girlfriend Caril Fugate ended much like bank-robbing folk heroes Bonnie and Clyde—in a hail of bullets. The only difference was that both Fugate and Starkweather survived and were finally apprehended after leaving eleven people dead in their wake—including Fugate's parents and her two-year-old sister who Starkweather stabbed to death."" (http://dangerousminds.net/comments/the_real_mickey_and_mallory_cand id_pics_of_mass-murderer) Technically the film is great because we never know if it is a real film or if it is some kind of collection of TV shows, news programs, documentaries, in situ reports, oscillating between the black and white of old archive documents and the colors of modern coverage, but after all at times it looks as if the black and white sequences were the color-blind vision of one of the two murderers who could not see the world the way it was but only the way they like it: as a shooting target alternating black and white circles.Have a good trip!Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",Natural Born Killers
47,johnnyboyz,Confrontational and outlandish piece from a combination of minds which go so far as to produce something thoroughly worthwhile.,7,23 April 2010,"Oliver Stone's rant on violence as a spectacle got across by means of the media and mediums of both television and cinema, conjoined into a film from a script initially by Tarantino before morphing into 1994's Natural Born Killers, is a rant worth absorbing. The film is a terrifying piece, shot like somebody's bad dream through a number of filters, tricks and gimmicks culminating in a blood soaked finale as a persistent undercurrent of hate and anger runs throughout it. The film is the sum of a film-maker all about shouting out about why the things that America stand for and represent are less than worth getting excited about, with the hotshot-at-the-time independent film making and writing mind of Quentin Tarantino; America's then crime-infused writing prodigy whose work at the time included the truly magisterial efforts of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. While the respective heads behind Natural Born Killers saw anything but eye-to-eye in the transitional process from script to screen, the film ended up somewhat of a triumph of all things substantial and outspoken.The film feeds off that consistent element in most of Tarantino's work of around the time, that young couple in love but on the wrong side of the law; something used to great effect in the opening and closure of Pulp Fiction and to a lesser extent as the entire drive for 1993's True Romance; a film about two young lovebirds on the run and getting up to their necks in it during the process. The film is consistently stylised and over the top in its violence, but that doesn't mean it stylises and makes violence visually appealing. Constructed by way of obscure angles, deranged filters and inconsistent film-stock; Natural Born Killers manages to paint an ugly, often scary aesthetic to its tale whilst systematically tap into everything it is that makes colourful; casually violent; edited so as to incorporate-a-cut-every-other-second American 'action' pictures the dross; manky; dressed-up nonsense that they usually are.In every sense of the construction, Natural Born Killers begins with an action set piece; this time at a road side diner in the middle of dusty, rural America. The chief antagonists inhabit the diner, the Knox couple of Mickey (Harrelson) and Mallory (Lewis) loitering around and taking a pit-stop in the midst of their spree across the nation. Mallory, young and flirtatious in her dancing to attract the attention of some travellers; Mickey, cold and stern in his sitting at the bar, shades on (despite already being indoors) giving him an un-Earthly look. This as an odd sequence kicks in which resembles a flashback, but in actuality, is just him from another angle through a different filter as he sits there. To a pumping soundtrack and a ton of camera tricks and cuts, they let loose with a flaying of knifes and haymakers cutting everyone down to size bar one.The introduction is stark, relatively by the numbers and without much in the way of comment; suggesting a set up for a pretty bog-standard road movie/crime film that just so happens to have some odd visual traits. But from here, Natural Born Killers transcends into a scathing attack on how it is we view violence by way of two dimensional visual mediums and the majority's reaction to it. There are numerous examples of characters enjoying death and destruction as a form of spectacle in the film, whether it's Mallory witnessing her parents' demise; the prison inmates watching on by way of a television set an interview with one of the leads towards the end of the picture or an immoral police officer named Jack Scagnetti (Sizemore) enjoying the sensation of strangling a prostitute to death. Each example carries with it a different sense of perspective, that of a first hand witnessing of the events; a third hand witnessing of the investigation into a violent character with consequent motivation to recommit violent acts as well as a first hand instigation of an act of violence which leads to death.An interesting point the film makes on violence and ill-begotten content is in the form of Mallory's back-story. She lives with a dysfunctional family unit featuring a mother, father and younger brother essentially acting out roles in a cheesy, early evening TV sitcom. The abuse she absorbs at the hands of her father is purposely trivialised, inter-cut with live-audience reactions that range from laughs at grotesque jokes her father cracks; to 'awwwing' and 'whooping' at respective times and on cue. The idea that audience's have lost the ability to properly interact with a range of disturbing material is apparent, and is a scene I must point people towards if they are amongst the many that chuckled during 2008's The Dark Knight; in which a man's life is ended by way of an assault with a pencil, and the perpetrator's actions thenceforth are the sorts of activity we're invited to be amused by. This systematic trivialisation of both murder; terrorism and detrimental psychological well-being is the sort of thing a film like Natural Born Killers wonderfully shows up.Mickey and Mallory's celebrity infused status resonates with the American public; they love them, pity them and probably want to be a bit like them. Like many-a degenerate youngster ill-informed with the issues at hand, kids dress up like the character's from their favourite texts such as the aforementioned Dark Knight: idolising and feeding off of said text's characters' attitudes and mannerisms. TV mogul Wayne Gale (Downey Jr.) is the living embodiment of this exploitation/trivialisation driven ideology figure, whom feeds 'the crowd' what they want; exemplified by the man's quote relating to the people that watch his programme on criminals being passive and ill-suited to the subject matter. The film is a brave and challenging text; something that dares to ask questions on where action sequences become unnecessary violence and how texts can ill-advisedly construct sequences of adult subject matter in child-like manners.",Natural Born Killers

52,Anonymous_Maxine,A stylistic masterpiece!,10,24 February 2008,"I remember being blown away when Natural Born Killers was first released, not because it was so good (I was in high school at the time and didn't really have a good grasp on what ""good"" really was in a movie), but just by how COOL it was. As I mentioned, I was in high school at the time, so anything that glorified violence was just cool and fun to me. As I went through college I heard more and more people talk about how terrible it is, because it's all about killing and murder and bloodshed and who wants to respect a movie about those things?But after more than ten years it has become clear that Natural Born Killers was never about violence, it is about the culture of broadcasting violence in America, about the American peoples fascination with crime, as exemplified by things like the seemingly endless O.J. Simpson trial and the L.A. riots, both of which received astonishing amounts of media coverage. Especially O.J. Simpson. My God man, I swear people at home watching TV knew more about that case than the jury. Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis are perfectly cast as Mickey and Mallory Knox, America's favorite serial killers. They travel across the country on their killing spree, but after a while you begin to notice that very little time is spent showing the killings - much more is spent on the media's and, by extension, the public's reaction. Consider, for example, Robert Downey Jr.'s character, a journalist, jumps for joy as the killings continue, because it's such a big story. Even the law enforcement involved is clearly brimming with glee at the publicity.More than anything else, Natural Born Killers is a satire about the American appetite for violence. And when I say appetite, I don't just mean how much we can swallow, I mean how much we demand. It's all an extension of things like the O.J. Simpson trial, or even shows like Cops, which is one of my favorites, where we can all sit back in the comfort of our own homes and watch someone else on TV having their lives screwed up, whether they are innocent or guilty. It doesn't matter, as long as it's someone else! I freely admit that I enjoy watching shows like Cops for exactly that reason. I got in trouble with the police a lot in high school so I know what a gigantic pain it is to have to deal with what comes next, and it is fun to watch it happen to other people because it reminds me of my own freedom.But Director Oliver Stone goes a step further in Natural Born Killers. The movie doesn't satirize America's acceptance of punishing criminals, we accept and glorify the actual violence, symbolized by Mickey and Mallory themselves.

What it does is draw attention to the structure that perpetuates and refines it, and at that which envelopes it for mass intake. The film emerges from a time when that achieved an extraordinary altitude.The most familiar claim regarding the film is that it's a send-up of the scandalous '90s media celebrating killers for the benefit of ratings, a showbiz culture in which the media commemorates violence. The film indeed apes self-styled ""reality"" shows and confronts an all-consuming media that's bled into each area of civilization. Actually, even while deriding TV, the film also searches the socio-cultural troubles of a media-inundated public. It's not simply that they reward depravity, but that such depravity affords mammoth ratings. They do what we want them to: It's our subconscious.The MPAA menaced the film with the NC-17. They compromised after appeals and cutting, but I could name a dozen more violent films before and since that left the MPAA undisturbed. Stone struck a nerve: This film isn't about violence, it's about our reaction to violence, and that's genuinely shocking. Maybe the natural born killer is within us all doesn't reveal itself in as unvarnished way as in this film, yet in an abstract sense, we do facilitate it by regarding actual killers as icons. Ultimately, if we do so, it's because it's become a long-established American practice.Here, befittingly, we become absorbed by two mass murderers, seemingly less corrupted than the establishment, which is a fantastic dissident statement, setting in motion what's essentially a revolution in the prison riot climax, during which the system is seen clearly as the chicken and the egg, good and evil metastasized. The preventive measures are all part of the committing elements. We see panicky, fearful patterns, unsettling quiet, cruel handling of prisoners, the persistent danger of their reprisal against the system. We hear bizarre animalistic noises emanating from within the walls. It's a much more real nightmare than before.Before, when we see Mallory's upbringing, for instance, shot in the fashion of a garish TV sitcom, with Rodney Dangerfield as her sexually abusive father, we hear a laugh track. Everything's hilarious to the ""live studio audience,"" because Dangerfield's timing is suited for gags, no matter how alarming the content is. Who actually pays attention to sitcoms, anyhow? Suddenly, Stone cuts to a demon, then instantly to a Coca-Cola commercial. This is an inspired way to illustrate the ability of commercials to pacify us.Back to Tommy Lee Jones as prison warden McClusky. He's seen too many movies, drunk on the event of being on TV. He shouts, blathers, oversees his prisoners like disturbed slaves. And then there's Robert Downey, Jr., as Wayne Gale, who hosts a syndicated tabloid news show. With an Australian diacritic that makes the entire thing into theater, he's so elated to be in the same frame with these legendary murderers that he barely minds what happens to him. Notice his reaction in the ultimate blood-doused riot, when he assumes he's untouchable because he's got the camera. Stone intercuts numerous old stock shots of American families: That's us, out of harm's way of this nightmarish prison.The extremely stylized format's largely a thematic pronouncement. To be sure, the inimitable look is indeed bred by whoever the central character happens to be at a specific moment. The black-and-white, for instance, creates simultaneous inner and outer versions of scenes. We're within the brains of two killers, delirious, delusional, on the road, at the onset. We don't know what will happen next, like them despite their sway over an entire crazed culture. When Downey emerges, the format transforms into a glossy TV style. The movie is constantly shifting, scrambling to find and not finding the reality of the 1990s.We may be in a cinematic terrain of channel-surfing rear-screen projections, cartoon sequences, the whole gamut of formats, continuous light changes surging elliptically, all used to unsettle, deconstruct. We're also in a country's consciousness trapped in the command of fear, spellbound by the entertainment of it all at once. We view Mickey and Mallory with the same separated allure as we do the local news freak shows, reviling their wickedness but bathing them in unbroken interest, even unspoken awe. And they'd see us the same way: Believe it or not, another pivotal element of the film is love. They're lost without each other. Mallory shows Mickey how to love, he shows her how to feel secure. The real story, to them at least, has been the intensifying devotion between them.And at the end, we find the boundary between reality and what we've just seen melt. Channel-surfing supplants. In the framework of the proceedings, Mickey and Mallory's lives feel somehow less bizarre. The closing footage flickering more and more rapidly, Rodney King, Tonya Harding, the Menendez brothers, Waco, Lorena Bobbitt, and naturally, O.J. This was the certainty of the time, the seed of Natural Born Killers.",Natural Born Killers

I expected it to be much more serious, but I must say I still loved the way this film was formulated. Harrelson will never be able to top his performance here as traumatized psycho, Mickey Knox, who meets lover-killer-wife to be, Mallory, (the always impressive Lewis). She's harvested so much anger and hate over a suppressed secret, which involved sexual abuse from her bastard of a Dad (yes (Rodney Dangerfield 7/100 for acting honors). After burning down the house with Dangerfield and his wife, (Edie Mcclurg) save for little brother, her and Mickey begin a cross country killing spree, taking hostages here and there. I can't believe after they're caught, the tally only equalled 52 victims. Robert Downey Junior is just great, as a heartless, blood sucking, vain gloried news reporter who hosts his own show, American Maniacs, donning not the best of Australian accents, but he's totally out of his own self, totally un Robert Downey Juniorish. NBK has humour too, from Tarantino's pen, obviously, we at times forget Oliver Stone's pen ever touched this script, but it would of been interesting to see what the film would of been like if Quentin had acquired 100 percent artistic control over the script or the whole project itself. For sickies NBK delivers a lot of gore, mostly in a lot of loud flashy images. The constant changing of black and white to loud colour is interesting, especially in the opening cafe scene where this one victim is not the only guy to lose his schlong. It's great too, The Drug Zone pharmacy scene, it's interior lit up in fluorescent green. The impressively inventive cartoon piece, that evolves from blood ecaping after Mickey and Mallory bloodily make their vows on a bridge, rocked, as does Tommy Lee Jones's over the top performance, as a crazed prison warden, not your average variety. Tom Sizemore's character as psycho hating cop, Jack Scagnetti who takes down our lovely media superstar pair, a strongly acted part. Reason being, for Scagnetti's hate of psychos, comes as when he was a boy, his mother was a fatal victim of one of Lee Harvey Oswald's bullets. Nice angle. NBK is a image movie, and at times when listening to the dialogue, you would think it was written in a haste, but it's certainly different, and a violently colorful larger than life flick, which at it's end, has you feeling dizzy and dazzled. As with Lewis's Kalifornia, we see two lions humping each other this time.",Natural Born Killers

57,billcr12,Woody Rules,8,12 September 2012,"Oliver Stone directed and wrote the script from a Quentin Tarantino story which caused friction between the two due to radical changes to the plot. Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis are Mickey and Mallory, two amoral misfits who meet and begin their fun at a diner in New Mexico by shooting down three rednecks who make the mistake of grabbing Mallory in a physical assault. And thus the carnage by the sadistic pair of killers.Next to the desert, where our lovebirds recall, with flashbacks, the first time that they met. Mallory is the sexually abused daughter of comedian Rodney Dangerfield; who is hilarious in his bathrobe, acting in a stranger manner toward his daughter. Mickey steals his car and goes to jail for the theft, but he escapes and later kills her parents. They hit the road, and on the journey, murder 52 people, and are made media stars by a tabloid reporter, Wayne Gale(Robert Downey, Jr.), who uses them to further his career. They wind up lost in the desert and encounter a Native American, Red Cloud, who chants around them to remove their demons, and Mickey kills him. They next are bitten by rattlesnakes and find a drugstore for an antidote. The pharmacist sets off an alarm and they are captured by the police after a shootout. A year later, as the two are to be transferred to a prison from a mental hospital, where a vicious warden played by Tommy Lee Jones plans to execute them as a vigilante. Wayne Gale sets up an interview with Mickey, who declares himself a ""natural born killer"" and the finale is a chaotic prison riot, with blood flying everywhere. The violence caused an uproar at the time of the movie's release, but it is necessary to the material. I love Woody Harrelson and Tommy Lee Jones; they seem to be having a great time as villains. Stone is known for his over the top style, and it is a fun two hour ride.",Natural Born Killers
58,Polaris_DiB,The televised event,6,23 August 2009,"Alright, so...Batty mental man Oliver Stone makes a movie about violence and television in American culture. Everyone understands that. Before you've even seen the movie, you probably already know the ""point"" he's trying to make. But it's upon actually watching the movie that opinions diverge... Did Oliver Stone make a good point about how televisized culture sets up celebrity for violent psychopaths, or did he contradict himself and end up making an overly stylized movie that in fact glories in the violence a bit too much? I say--and this might be frustrating, but here it goes--neither. He made televised violence. Just that, simple, and nothing more. Profound? No, but it's not intended to be. Elegant? Eeeeeehhh... maybe.The key sequence (or, rather, in my humble opinion, the BEST sequence) is the family drama episode, in which Mr. Stone utilizes laugh tracks to make what, for anyone like me who doesn't LIKE television, and thus rarely watches it, a pretty obvious point: laugh tracks say the joke is funny, but it isn't. At all. Rodney Dangerfield is well cast in this situation as someone that you know is supposed to be funny--but is not, and is not intended to be, period. That is the split between television and, well, good ol' fashioned ability to understand a story for yourself. Television actually has to tell you when to friggin' laugh, and yet that just proves that the joke wasn't all that good from the beginning.And so but so anyway of course I stress again that this, this is not profound. Anybody who actually pays attention to that flickering boobtube has their complaints and their ways of criticizing and the fully stated though for some reason never understood knowledge that television is rather degrading to consciousness. But the point in here isn't that the television event causes violence, it's that Oliver Stone is making the violence a televised event. You want to watch television, you could just as well watch this movie as you would any other show. They have the same logic.So he does well at that. Sometimes it feels as if, well, things just aren't following. That's, 'cause, uh, television will interject random things that don't follow. Sometimes the action breaks to show something else. That's cause channels be flipped. Whatever. I'm cool with that. The problem is that I also don't really LIKE television. So I have to admit, that in some ways Stone was good enough at reproducing the ""logic"" of television into making this movie an event, that it inspired in me the same thing that television does: boredom. Go figure.So anyway, I think the really disturbing thing about this movie isn't much how it's done, what it has to say, or the graphic nature of it--all stuff done better, and with a more decided hand, before and after, to varying effect. It's that I have actually seen people watch this movie for entertainment. Stone certainly didn't want it to be entertaining. The theme certainly doesn't want it to be entertaining. But Stone made it such a good televised effect, that during the family drama scene, I'm sure there were people laughing--because they were cued to.--PolarisDiB",Natural Born Killers

If nothing else - I'd say that this impotent, white-trash, Romeo & Juliet story certainly earned itself a couple of loud & robust ""Bronx Cheers"" for its efforts to at least try to say something relevant, but (inevitably) failing miserably to deliver (thanks, of course, to its disease-minded screenwriter, Quentin Tarantino).With its cynical ""Tabloid"" mentality, Natural Born Killers (NBK, for short), stands tall as one of the most over-the-top, narrow-minded statements about the insatiable American media-machine (and its on-going love affair with its most sadistic and deranged citizens) that I've ever seen.If you were to completely strip away the novelty of NBK's often-impressive camera-work, along with its pseudo-psychedelic imagery, then about the only thing you'd be left with would be a truly dismal story about a bunch of despicable characters who aren't even worth the slightest bit of notice.Featuring a non-stop barrage of ""in-your-face"" violence & brutality (for the sake of itself), I think that director Oliver Stone clearly missed the mark in the realm of sick & twisted humour.In NBK, Homicide detectives sniff discarded women's underwear for ""evidence"" and its serial killers' victims are all looked upon as people who deserved to be murdered.And, finally - Right from the start, I thought that actress Juliette Lewis, as Mallory Knox, was nothing but an irksome, pain-in-the-ass flake.",Natural Born Killers
60,kevin_robbins,This is a magnificent stylish film way ahead of its time that also stands the test of time,10,28 September 2021,"Natural Born Killers (1994) is currently available on Tubi and tells the tale of two troubled souls who find peace in eachother and try to live a life away from society.

The cast selection and execution in this is absolutely brilliant across the board, including some great cameos (Steve Wright and Dangerfield). The script and mannerisms fit the cast so well and the violence was brilliant and fun. This feels like a Rob Zombie movie decades before Zombie.

61,dee.reid,"Hypnotic, but...",10,20 December 2003,"...people really need to take another look at ""Natural Born Killers.""The plot: Mickey and Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis in roles that are a little too convincing) are a husband/wife pair of serial killers whose vicious crime spree across the country has made them into media superstars.This movie is a barrage of frightening and surreal images, and is damn near hypnotic to watch.I can see where the controversy surrounding this film comes from but what I don't understand is where the hate is coming from.1994's ""Natural Born Killers"" has to be one of the best movies of the 90s - its sole purpose on this planet is to showcase America's fascination with violence.But lets try to understand the hate.  This movie is here for one reason and I think that we can all agree on that reason.  Oliver Stone is a competent and accomplished filmmaker and most of the hate seems to be directed towards him.  Stone, who is working from a script that has since been virtually disowned by Quentin Tarantino, pretty much took over and shaped the screenplay to his own vision.I can understand why fans of Tarantino have a right to be p*ssed off, but I find it extremely difficult to believe that they truly hate the finished product, and the same goes for Tarantino.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Tarantino fan myself, and I'm sure he didn't appreciate Stone re-writing his script, but he should be proud of what was done with it.The message, if you can call it that, is that we are obsessed with violence, and Stone exposes our love for it and spits it back in our faces.  To quote Marlon Brando -  ""The horror, the horror.""  I say to hell with the hypocritical people who find this movie offensive for they are the ones that this movie is truly aimed towards.Yes, horrific images are displayed in this movie and terrible things happen to people all throughout, but it's giving us we want, and we hate it.  The hate surrounding this film is extremely misguided.  My high school paper recently did an article about sex and violence on television and one of the supposed outlets of that violence would be our fascination with the war in Iraq and the Jessica Lynch story.It said that we are much, much more concerned with the sex (I personally don't think today's teenage girls are THAT impressionable, but who knows?), rather than the violence (which apparently seems to be causing a misguided sh!tstorm of controversy, too, and like the sex, I don't think that people are that impressionable), namely the kind that is seen in music videos and such.  Though the article refused to go into specifics (but we know who the people being discussed are and I'm sure they do, too), it brings me back to ""Natural Born Killers,"" which I think people need to take another look at.In this day and age, violence on television is becoming more and more commonplace, and this movie's relevance seems to make its viewing that much more important.  Before we go and continue to bash the hell out of it again, people need to come back and take a look around themselves and watch ""Natural Born Killers.""",Natural Born Killers

No, it's not a daft, all-gore-no-brains B-movie: this film (based on an original story by Quentin Tarantino) is a ferocious satire about the mass media, especially television, that keep influencing our lives, and not always in a positive way. It's the kind of media that turns everything into a spectacular event: criminals are treated like movie stars and reporters think of themselves as bigger than the story they're supposed to tell (the perfect example is Aussie idiot Wayne Gale, played to awkward perfection by Robert Downey Jr.). The truth is, among all these ego-fueled maniacs (including Tommy Lee Jones'Dwight McClusky), Mickey and Mallory seem to be the most sane people around...Slick, provocative and funny, it's Oliver Stone at his most excessive and anarchic.Like Terrence Malick's Badlands, but high on LSD.",Natural Born Killers

Stone over-directs so much it's difficult to know what's going on much less enjoy any of it. It's not thrilling, just brainless violence that's so stylized it's incomprehensible. If that's what Stone had in mind, then he's made a masterpiece. Nevertheless the film has more than just bad direction working against it. The casting of non-entities Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis as Mickey & Mallory, a white trash version of Bonnie & Clyde, whose crime spree is chronicled in gruesome detail by muckraking TV reporter Robert Downey Jr doesn't help. They don't have the depth or gravitas to shines through the muck left behind by Stone's direction. They're lightweights when the film needs the likes of Dennis Hopper and Sissy Spacek. The rest of the cast doesn't fare too well either. Tommy Lee Jones is embarrassingly bad as the prison warden bent on capturing the couple and Downey, affecting an Australian accent, is dismal.

Images of the natural world are indeed ""cool"", or at least they could be, if the camera lingered on the images for more than half a second. And I loved that Leonard Cohen background music, especially ""The Future"".That said, ""Natural Born Killers"" is awful. With a story ostensibly about two young lovebirds that go on a savage murder spree, the film glamorizes violence; the apparent message to kids: killing is ""cool"" ...The B&W/color cinematography combo is flashy, gimmicky, and funky. In other words it's cartoonish, to draw in the prepubescent crowd. The film's commentary on the media is superficial and unconvincing. The film is all glitter and glitz, to mask the absence of substantive thematic content. When you look at the writing credits, the explanation for this sorry mess becomes clear.Given all that ""cool"" photographic swagger, other film elements are rendered largely irrelevant, especially the casting and acting. Who cares who's cast as Mickey and Mallory? When images come and go at the speed of light, who can analyze the quality of the acting? Is acting even important here? Is the dialogue important? To these last two questions I'd say probably not.Of the Oliver Stone films that I have seen, ""Natural Born Killers"" is the only one that I did not like. But then is it really Stone's movie?

65,jimbo-53-186511,Classic case of style over substance,1,14 May 2013,"Natural Born Killers is a really bizarre film revolving around the lives of husband and wife serial killers Mickey and Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis). What is interesting about this film is that whilst Tarantino was behind the original story, it is Oliver Stone who has directed this film and actually altered his story (which Tarantino wasn't happy about at the time). Stone seems to have directed NBK in the same style as Tarantino - you can tell this by the fact that the film keeps constantly jumping from colour to black and white, the random animation, the bizarre cut scenes. Whether this is a good or bad thing is a matter of opinion, but I personally found all the cut scenes both pointless and unnecessary and served as a distraction more than anything else. But the editing and direction weren't the only problems I had with NBK,The opening scene shows Mickey and Mallory in a cafe and Mallory gets up and starts dancing. 2 men enter the cafe and Mallory kills one of the men when he starts flirting with her and Mickey takes care of the other bloke. This was a pretty good opening scene (despite the rather strange 'cut scenes' in between). In the next scene we see how Micky and Mallory first met - they meet at Mallory's house, get talking go for a drive together and then plot to kill Mallory's parents - her dad (played by Rodney Dangerfield) was abusive to her and she also blames her mum (played by Edie McClurg) for standing by and not doing anything about it. OK - up to this point I was still buying it - there was at least a motive for this crime (abusive father and passive mother), but the film seems to base Mallory's whole motivation on killing lots of people on her troubled child hood. Really? Whilst I understand why Mallory might want to kill her father due to him being abusive to her and making her have a pretty traumatic child hood, I just couldn't see someone going out and killing lots of innocent people for that reason alone. Mickey's child hood is touched upon later in the film whilst he is being interviewed by TV Reporter Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr), but again the motivations for mass murder don't seem to be apparent.Another problem is the relationship between Micky and Mallory wasn't very well developed. We see they initially meet, go for a drive, kill Mallory's parents and then they get married - talk about rushed. Their child hood issues aren't really discussed and seemed to just be shown in occasional flashbacks (presumably just to be stylish).The acting was generally poor. Tommy Lee Jones was appalling as the prison warden and just seemed to be over acting in every scene he was in. Robert Downey Junior didn't fair much better (although his over acting wasn't quite as bad as TLJ's). Juliette Lewis was OK and Woody Harrelson faired slightly better (not brilliant though).I also thought that the opening scene would somehow tie in with the rest of the film as it was shot out of sequence (as with Pulp Fiction) but it didn't which was disappointing.As mentioned above, this film is full of style - lots of killings, black and white effects, nice animation etc. However, the film had no substance - bad script, dubious character motivations and direction and editing that were all over the place.

Particularly the scenes with Rodney Dangerfield (mimicking trash TV that indeed was popular in the US: ""Married with Children"", etc.) The scenes with Mickey and Mallory, becoming lovers and co-murderers in order to escape from their respective dysfunctional families are graphic and bizarre; Yet, look at the daily menu on American TV: Jerry Springer and white trash is NOT the status quo in Europe or the Far East, at least during the several times I have visited.Stone was making a statement. I have noticed that he evokes a love or hate response. Thank you, Oliver Stone, for showing us America through your viewpoint. 9/10",Natural Born Killers
73,aidanratesmovies,"Lots of talent, little execution",6,20 May 2020,"Unique, and solidly acted, Natural Born Killers suffers most from a large amount of ideas, without ever executing any of them fully. The film contains many strong performances, most notably by its two leads- Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis. It also contains some of its best performances from its supporting cast, most impressively Rodney Dangerfield in the role of Mallory's abusive father, and Robert Downey Jr. and Tommy Lee Jones in smaller, but equally notable roles. The film is not very entertaining, and at times the muddled plot and storyline can seem to be quite difficult to follow, not to mention the artsy interruptions it seems to tackle throughout its whole runtime. The distractions seem interesting at first, but soon prove to be quite stale, and the story is interesting, but seems needlessly complicated. In the end, Natural Born Killers is not a total success in the scheme of things. It has its great touches and moments, especially considering the talent involved, and is quite unique. However, the direction the film went seems needlessly overbearing, and probably left as it was originally intended. I am a huge fan of Tarantino, and feel a bit bad for him knowing they changed the film's script (of which he originally wrote) so drastically, and realizing this makes me believe that his originally intended version was most likely a lot better, and a lot more fun to watch.
My Rating: 7.25/10",Natural Born Killers
74,rbverhoef,Blame the media,8,20 March 2003,"Natural Born Killers is a disturbing film. It is a great film as well. Visually it looks great and between all that violence there is a message. Criticizing the influence of media with another form of media called film.With a lot of cuts, strange camera angles, different colors, the kind of music and a lot of symbolism the sick world of mass murderers Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) is presented. And the sick world of how people react to their violence. Director Oliver Stone shows it to us with this satire in a great and really disturbing way.Harrelson and Lewis hit the right tone for Mickey and Mallory. Tom Sizemore as a cop, Robert Downey Jr. as a journalist (representing the whole media) and especially Tommy Lee Jones as the prison warden are great too. Originally written by Quentin Tarantino, although he was not too happy with the result in the end, this is one of the best satires I have seen. May be it is not for everyone, the images are not always that nice, but the meaning must be for everyone.",Natural Born Killers
75,a_chinn,Read Tarantino's original script instead of watching Oliver Stone's indulgent mess,5,22 October 2017,"Oliver Stone's indictment of the media told through the story of young lovers on the run, serial killers Mickey and Mallory Knox, Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis. Based on an early script by Quentin Tartantino, Tarantino took his name off of the film and instead asked for only a ""story"" credit. He's been quoted as saying if you love the film, that was Oliver, if you hated the film, that was Oliver, essentially disavowing the film, which I didn't really see why he'd want to distance himself from it at the time, but rewatching the film now, it was a smart move on his part to distance himself from this mess. I was shocked by how poorly this film has aged. It may be a case of it having been imitated so many times since then, both in terms of style and content, that the film has lost it's original impact; much like rewatching the original version of ""The Exorcist"" (thought that film is still good, it's just not as scary). After my disappointment re-watching this film, I got out my copy of Quentin Tarantino's original script and pretty much all of the moments in this film that do work were straight out of Tarantino's original version; a cool opening credits sequence with crazy rear projections, Robert Downy Jr. as a sensationalistic Geraldo-like TV news reporter, some sharp dialogue from from Tom Sizemore as Seymore Skagnetti and Tommy Lee Jones as Warden Dwight McClusky. When the film drifts into Stone's seeming obsession with Native American mysticism, indulgent mix media visuals (Rob Zombie used this same style to much better effect in his films), and everyone trying to out overact the person next to them ruins what could have been a tough, nihilistic young lovers on the run ""Badlands"" homage. Where I will give Stone credit is the casting of Rodney Dangerfield as Lewis' dad, in a flashback sequence to Mallory Knox's abusive dysfunctional home life prior to running off with Mickey, presented as a nightmarish sitcom from hell, complete with a laugh track that punctuates societal indifference to domestic atrocities. That was not in Tarantino's script and Rodney is a positively demonic and terrifying version of his usual comic on-screen persona. I'll also give Stone credit for a dynamite soundtrack (or at least for hiring Trent Reznor to produce the soundtrack) which includes Leonard Cohen, L7, Patti Smith, Duane Eddy, NIN, Cowby Junkies, Jane's Addiction, Barry Adamson, Lard, and many more. Downey, Sizemore, and particularly Jones seem to strike the best tone of giving completely over-the-top performances, but doing so without winking at the camera, which I think Stone allowed Harrelson and Lewis to do too often throughout the film. Sure the on- screen media frenzy surrounding Mickey and Mallory and their cult of personality was fed, created, and sustained by the media is Stone's major point of the film, but it makes the characters too much to take. You can catch glimpses of a good film every now and then, buried beneath Stone's sound and fury, but in general this film is a preachy, heavy-handed mess. Do yourself a favor and read Tarantino's original script instead of watching Oliver Stone's indulgent mess.",Natural Born Killers
76,triple8,Oh what a movie.,8,20 August 2003,"Horrifically fascinating,Violent, brutal, twisted and dark Natural Born Killers is an amazing movie. I think anybody, even if they didn't like the movie would have to admit that it's a movie that stands alone in sheer originality and that on some level there's never been a movie like it.I remember when I first saw this movie on video at a friend's apartment, in a major city in the middle of the night....Natural born killers isn't the sort of movie you can apply normal terms to  like ""well, that was cool wasn't it""-at the end your sort of left speecheless not really sure what you saw.I'm not a fan of violent movies(usually). Can I say I liked this movie? Yes. Can I say I loved this movie? I don't know about that. Can I say I'd sit through this movie again?

77,Movie-ManDan,Breathtaking!,10,26 October 2014,"This has got to be the weirdest, coolest and most trippin' movie I have ever seen. Oliver Stone is notorious for doing shocking and controversial films, but this might be his most shocking. But I will have to say, this movie is not for everyone. There is explicit content that can really make somebody uncomfortable. The movie is about Mickey and Mallory Knox (Harrelson, Lewis) that both suffered bad childhoods that go across the country killing people for the fun of it, with the media glorifying them. The general story alone is enough for people not to watch. Thing is, the media glorifies and horrifies anything they can get their hands on. Look at they way the OJ Simpson trail was handled. I'll have to say, Mickey and Mallory are cool killers, like at the level of Leatherface and Michael Myers. Their murderous rampage is brutal and unsettling, which is genius. But what this movie often gets flack for is the way it it filmed: brief animation incorporation, odd colour changing, messy angles, and many cuts to different shots and angles. So the way it is made will make you uncomfortable, or even sick and annoyed. But if you can sit through this, you will not be disappointed. This movie was very hard to make (I do have experience making movies), so I was very impressed. This movie was so much fun and so well made, it takes my breath away every time I see it.",Natural Born Killers
78,Easygoer10,An Outstanding Film,9,4 July 2019,"As much as Oliver Stone's career has had it's ups and downs, this film is my favorite directed by him. There are other very good ones,; however, noting is a darkly humorous (to put it mildly) as ""NBK"". From 1990 through 1994, in my opinion, there were about four stunning films. This is one of them. It was so off the wall, I couldn't help but laugh out loud even years later at home alone. It's the same way when I watch ""In Bruges"" (2008) which has a stunningly great performance from Colin Farrell (and others). Also, the Bluray disc has some hilarious outtakes as well. Pardon the digression. NBK as I (and others) call it, is a completely different film, but has the same beyond dark (almost black) humor. A must see for anyone with a wicked sense of humor.",Natural Born Killers
79,Sandcooler,"Potentially good, but gets lost in its own style",5,27 August 2011,"There are actually a lot of positive things to say about this movie. The screenplay for instance is excellent, how can it not be with guys like Oliver ""Scarface"" Stone and Quentin Tarantino (who sorta co-wrote, but not enough to actually like the final version) behind it. The actors are also universally good, with great performances by Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis and highly amusing bit parts by Tom Sizemore, Rodney Dangerfield, Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Downey Jr. And though the subject matter of this one has been done many times, it still leaves room for some exploration and stays really interesting. There's just one problem about all of this though: Oliver Stone never really makes full use of these elements because he's too busy being artsy. Every pretentious art movie cliché can be found in this movie: copious shifting from color to B&W for no reason whatsoever, confusing edits, overuse of flashbacks, random color filters, I guess it's nice for Stone that he knows some neat camera tricks but there's no need to bother the audience with them. Some film buffs may find something profound in all of that, but the ones that don't are stuck with a jumpy movie that annoys the hell out of them. This is especially really irritating in the first half, where it actually feels like work to figure out what's happening. The second half is filmed in a (slightly) more straight-forward manner and thus infinitely better, in this last hour you finally get a taste of the raw power the movie could have had all along. This movie is pretty good, but at the same time it's a huge chore to watch. Missed opportunity.",Natural Born Killers
80,Matt_Layden,"Oliver Stone skillfully creates a film that is ""in your face"".",6,16 December 2006,"Mickey and Mallory go on a killing spree road rage and become famous with the media. Their love for each other is strong, but they eventually get caught and end up in prison. While on the inside they start a riot and successfully escape, continuing their roaring rampage pf hell on the streets. They are Natural Born Killers.In the film Natural Born Killers, Oliver Stone skillfully creates a film that is ""in your face"" in terms of black comedy, violence and it's message of the media. Throughout the film, Stone uses Dutch angles and the different camera types to emphasize the fact that the main characters live in an askew universe. The Dutch angle is used to portray the psychological tension in the film. The entire film is not grounded in any reality, this is evident in the scene after Mickey and Mallory kill the Native American and she breaks the fourth wall barrier by talking to the audience. Throughout the film, Stone also uses black and white scenes which show the inner and outer moments for the specific character. For example, when one of the two men who enter the restaurant talks ill about Mallory to Mickey, the scene turns black and white as Mickey has an outer experience and imagines himself in blood killing the two men. Also in the ""I Love Mallory"" segment, Mallory is groped by her father. This scene is also in black and white, but he probably never grabbed her; her father, in her mind, is groping her with his words.One of the main symbols in the film is the snake, which is a symbol for knowledge. The rattle snake saves Mickey while he tries to break out of prison by biting the horse the guard is on, but then the snake is also the reason that Mickey and Mallory end up in prison again. Stone uses colours throughout the film creating a surreal experience. The colours he uses are red and green and show evil and sickness. The colour red appear whenever Mickey's inner demon appears, right after the interview he kills everyone and it fades to red, then fades into the prison brawl. The colour green occurs when something violent is about to happen, such as the Drug Store shootout and the lime pie at the beginning.I for one had a headache after watching this and can only recommend it as a one time only viewing. If it weren't for the over-the-top performances by every single person in this film, I would have graded it lower. With the exception of Lewis, everyone does an outstanding job of adding fuel to the fire of this film. Harrelson gives one of his best performances of his career as the insane, blood-thirsty Mickey Knox. Harrelson carries this film on his back and he is the driving force behind what is actually good about it. Tommy Lee Jones and Tom Sizemore play the ""authorties"" and again, over-the-top performances from both of them. Robert Downey Jr is the media journalist and his transformation at the end is funny and horrifying at the same time. Downey Jr was a perfect choice for that role. It's Lewis that drags the film down, with her annoying, scrawny ass yelling and kicking all over the place. She isn't the best looking person either.To sum up the film, it would be that it gives off that feeling that it was a student film with a big budget. Sure everything could have meaning behind it, but where does one draw the line. I don't know, but I can tell you that Stone crosses it. There's using something artistically, then there's overkill, NBK is full of overkill. I can only imagine what Tarantino's script would have been like if it were filmed, and not what Stone did. The black comedy, although good in some places, didn't really need to be in here. The film suffers from it. With Stone it is usually hit or miss. NBK is that odd one that lies somewhere in between, more along the line of a miss, but not over it. It's certainly not his best effort, but not his worst either. Give it that one viewing that it needs, then decide whether or not you can stand taking Tylonol Extra Strength after every viewing.",Natural Born Killers
81,gangstahippie,Disturbing and Good,9,19 July 2007,"Rated R for Strong Graphic Violence,Language and Sexual Content.Natural Born Killers is a very violent and controversial film.The two Columbine school shooters were said to have have watched this film over and over again.Its a very violent film and not recommended for children who cannot handle this type of material.I am 15 now and I saw this film when I was 13.It didn't affect me in any way.I play plenty of violent video games and watch violent movies and they don't make me want to kill anybody.This is because I can separate fantasy from reality.Anyway that was my rant...now on to the film review.Natural Born Killers is an underrated and excellent movie.Im surprised its only 6.8, I think it should be in IMDb's Top 250.The performances in this film are great.Woody Harleson the actor who played Mickey Knox ironically had a father who was a hit-man.Anyway the story is great as it shows how the media portrays murderers.The film basically shows the life of Mickey and Malloryy knox.In a comedic ""I Love Lucy"" spoof, you see Mallory's life at home with her abusive father.Mickey is a butcher who delivers meat and delivers it one day to Mallory's home.The two both led disturbing lives and basically they kill Mallory's family and start going on killing spree's.After a while, they get caught and go to prison while a reporter wants to do an interview with Mickey.A prison riot breaks out and basically they are set free.A cool aspect about this film is sometimes during the violent scenes of the film, you see some trippy images.Natural Born Killers is a great film worth watching for anyone who can handle it.",Natural Born Killers
82,brando647,"Wow, This Movie is Awesome...",9,29 April 2012,"It might take a few viewings to fully bask in the madness that is NATURAL BORN KILLERS, but I thought this was one twistedly awesome flick. When I first saw the movie, I thought it was too bizarre to take it all in at once. The hyperkinetic editing, the constantly shifting visual styles, the absurd surrealismit was too much to absorb. This movie really is a piece of art. In a time when modern audiences are more apt to drop their hard-earned cash on cookie-cutter blockbusters or rom-coms, director Oliver Stone releases a lightning-paced, abstract film commentary about the world's obsession with the villain and the role the media plays in glorifying the worst elements of humanity. On the surface, the movie follows the violent exploits of serial-killing lovers Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) Knox as their murder spree down Route 666 continues across America. Meanwhile, the media focus on the couple has created a cult fan-base of people cheering the duo on as if they were heroes of the latest generation. The actions of the killers has grabbed the interest of two particular individuals: homicide detective Jack Scagnetti (Tom Sizemore) and host of the hit show ""American Maniacs"", Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.). Both pursue the couple for their own interests. Scagnetti's twisted mind has both a boundless hatred for two and a perverted interest in Mallory, while Gale pursues his own career interests in an attempt to garner an exclusive interview with America's most beloved murderers.I love this movie for how unapologetic it is. NATURAL BORN KILLERS is a blatant slap in the face to the modern media and their obsession with the lowest forms of humanity. Flip through the bottomless pit of cable stations out there and you'll find loads and loads of true crime documentaries, unsolved murder mysteries, and tales from prison bars. On that same note, modern television is chock full of reality shows where we celebrate personalities we wouldn't suffer in person for more than a minute. ""Jersey Shore"", ""Real Housewives"", etc.: it's as if Oliver Stone was a prophet and predicted America's downfall in the world of entertainment. But he didn't just create your usual crime drama with some half-hearted message tagged on. NATURAL BORN KILLERS grabs you by the collar and rips you along on its roller-coaster ride of insanity. It's frenetic pace and MTV-era editing keeps you consistently off balance as the madness unfolds. The whole movie plays out as if broadcast straight from the eyes of the killers with bizarre color schemes, blink-and-you-miss-them cutaways, and animations. The whole thing is one big, awesome mind trip. And it doesn't pull any punches. The violence in the movie (at least the director's cut, which is the version I've seen) is brutal and it shows the world's audience eating it up. It's disgusting and you hesitate to believe that, in a real world scenario, such a response would occur. But then you look at our ongoing obsession with these reality shows and their lowbrow content and you have to wonder, well just maybe Everything in this movie is hilariously over-the-top and that includes the performances. Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis are perfect as Mickey and Mallory. Harrelson has got serious charisma and even the role of a cold-blooded murder isn't enough to dampen it. You know you shouldn't, but you end up cheering for him. Lewis on the other hand is downright twisted. Her character, Mallory, is a young girl mentally and emotionally deformed over years of abuse from her father until she meets her ""hero"" in Mickey and embarks with him on this journey. She's a maladjusted little deviant. Now keep in mind, in this movie, there are no ""good"" guys. Just as Mickey and Mallory are evil for their murders, the usual ""heroes"" are no better. The cop on the case is crooked and battles his own demons, venting his personal issues on his criminal targets. The media feeds on the case and feeds Mickey and Mallory into the television sets of the hungry public around the world like a drug. And the penal system, the system created to control and reform these sorts of people once their in custody, is a time bomb waiting to explode under the tyrannical rule of it's media-hungry warden (Tommy Lee Jones in an awesome bit of madness). There are no heroes in the world of this film, only villains. It sounds like a pretty pessimistic view on society that Stone is portraying here, but the worst part is how close it's come to realization. NATURAL BORN KILLERS is an adrenaline-fueled warning of where humanity's obsession with criminal ""celebrities"" can lead.",Natural Born Killers
83,DeeNine-2,Another romantic comedy for the grunge set,7,3 January 2000,"One night Oliver Stone was watching David Lynch's ""Wild at Heart"" (1990) and he thought, ""I'll show that half talent how a romantic comedy for the nineties is REALLY done,"" and he made ""Natural Born Killers."" It was a lot of fun. Well, actually he also watched Kalifornia (1993) and thought, ""Juliette Lewis is kind of sexy and she's has potential. She doesn't really need to be THAT dumb."" And so he reprised her role from that film, and saw that it was good.Juilette Lewis as Mallory is Laura Dern on speed, and Woody Harrison as Mickey is Nicolas Cage tweaked. This is one bad ass film. Ah, but there's a deeper layer. Oliver Stone has targets. Somebody has to be satirized or what's the point? Well, Geraldo gets it with both barrels, that is obvious as Robert Downey Jr. plays Wayne Gale, a sort of Geraldo with a Brit accent. (It plays since the British invented sleaze journalism). But beating up on Geraldo is too easy. What is really being satirized in this film is the audience! Ah, yes, pick their pockets and laugh at them. As Red Cloud says we've-that is us, Mickey and Mallory in our dreams-we've been watching too much TV. Mickey replies (innocent of being the target) ""It's kind of like the twilight zone."" Yeah, that's TV, the twilight zone. Red Cloud further says we're (again we are M and M) ""lost in a world of ghosts""-the ghosts of TV and the movies and the tabloids. Funny in support of this satire is the Japanese media girl who remarks as a commentary to the ""Drug Zone"" drug store capture of Mickey, ""He has a rather large gun."" And when Mickey has to surrender, she adds, ""He's now rendered impotent.""In case we miss the attack on the media, we are surrounded in our motel room by images from the TV coming through the windows. (We are literally surrounded by this crap!) It should be pointed out that we get the media we deserve, just as we get the politicians we deserve. Somebody's buying those supermarket tabloids; somebody's watching Jerry Springer and the nightly news. As M and M get ready to do the mating dance, on the small TV plays animal shows with lions and beetles and such doing the wild thing. Attacking animal shows! Is nothing sacred? Of course not. Stone's main purpose is to satirize the American psyche and get paid for doing it. And he does. And it's fun.There are so many nice touches: ""Route 666""; Wayne Gale's vain use of a nose hair clipper; his calling M and M ""the most charismatic serial killers ever"" for his TV show ""American Maniacs,"" which is logo'ed like ""American Gladiators""; the adoring crowds cheering our psychos on like the Beatles in their prime. But what I especially loved was the sit-com clips near the beginning with Rodney Dangerfield as a ""Father Knows Best,"" ""Married with Children,"" burlesque of a psycho dad.But it's really sad how Oliver Stone loses his concentration toward the end of his movies. Here we have something close to a satirical masterpiece, but he just can't finish. The absurd near- finale as they break out of prison dodging bullets as in an old time Western just wasn't up to the quality of the rest of the film (although Tommy Lee Jones had fun as the warden). The tacked- on little sit-com ending with Mickey as something like Chevy Chase in a Land Cruiser with a pregnant Mallory as his wife in maternity garb (with a cute little boy and girl already in tow) was precious and should have been expanded to replace the silly shoot 'em up at the prison.Philosophically speaking (and of course an Oliver Stone movie has a philosophic position, otherwise where's the pretension?) we really are just animals who kill anything that gets in our way, the rain forests, all those cows and chickens (burp!), any other species, each other-what the hey, death's not that big a deal. It happens to everybody.The Leonard Cohen recording, ""The Future"" played into the trailing credits has just the right tone and feel for this cynical look at the American mass mind as we enter the third millennium of the current era. May God have mercy on our souls.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",Natural Born Killers
84,xredgarnetx,Gory comedy,7,1 July 2006,"NBK is a gory sendup of America gone wild with guns and violence, an indictment of too much TV and too little manners. Director Oliver Stone clearly has a message to deliver here, although it runs dry about two thirds of the way through after Harrelson shaves his head and really gets crazy. Up until then, however, NBK is a pretty compelling satire of the American way of life as lived in the outside of the Northeast, where guns are a birthright, ignorance is bliss and life is one giant dustbowl. Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis are great as modern-day Charlie Starkweather and Carol Fugate characters, and the unending, sickening violence they are capable of begins 30 seconds into the flick. Stylized to suggest their abused states of mind, NBK is like watching the biggest train wreck in history. You either go with it or you walk away from it.

When speaking about ""Natural Born Killers"", all you hear about IS the violence. But this film has so much more.As a Broadcast Journalism student, I found alot of attention to the media in this film. This movie raked the media over the coals and it deserved to be. What was done in 1994 is common place today, one should have paid more attention to that message. When viewing the film of late, I cannot stop shaking my head seeing the current similarities.What I did like the most was the film direction and techniques used by Oliver Stone. Any body studying film technique should see and study this project. (Anyone studying screenplays should not.) When this film was released, Oliver Stone already had a name so by throwing in everything you could use in a film, you'd think it was a Grad Student or first time director going for the attention. Instead it was Stone going for the Gold and what you will see is as visually as wild as the violence contained within.But ignore as I try, the violence is a part of the film. It's raw, wild, unflinching and without a heart. I'm sure there was more story and development to the two central characters beyond their violent rampages --- but ya know, I got the grasp of the situation and why they were like they were regardless. It wasn't glorifing violence to me, it was showing a a result of abuse, conditioning and its results....but that's a study for another day.",Natural Born Killers

I had the ultimate misfortune of viewing this twisted piece of cinema a few nights ago, and it hurts to have to remember all those hypnotic film techniques and disturbing images. Natural Born Killers is a chaotic experience, to say the least. First off, I'll just say that I didn't hate this film. There are some solid performances, with Robert Downey Jr being the stand out in my opinion. The script is decent, as is the soundtrack, and when the movie isn't going over-the-top with the off-kilter camera angles, flashing lights, slow motion, subliminal images, and different colors, it can be interesting to watch. However, there is just way too much of the above mentioned ""effects,"" and they detract from what could be an incredible movie. I don't know what purpose they served, other than making the film have a ""unique"" (and headache-inducing) style. The film's style isn't the only thing that'll make your head hurt. Natural Born Killers was made to criticize and satire America's obsession for violence, and while at first a fascinating concept, its constantly shoved down your throat nearly every five minutes, so much so you'll get a headache from that too after about an hour.And I hate to sound like an old fart, but the film did go overboard with the violence. It's not so much what is shown but rather the nature of it; I don't want to give anything away, but some of the things shown sickened me (most of all some subliminal flashes of what looked like graphic images from The Holocaust; completely unnecessary and offensive in a film like this).The violence is gratuitous and forced, and while that is probably the point, that didn't stop it from making me feel nauseous and even a little angry. Still, check it out if you have a strong stomach and are willing to see something unique. It's not a bad film, but my God is it brutal and inhumane.",Natural Born Killers

91,mattymatt4ever,Does Oliver Stone have A.D.D.?,2,19 March 2002,"I'm not going to complain about the graphic nature of the film.  In fact, most of the violence is sustained and left to the imagination.  The physical and psychological violence didn't disturb me.  It was the style of filmmaking that disturbed me.  I'm sure Oliver Stone had some valid points to make in doing this film, but it's all muddled in this hyperkinetic, rambling, incoherent structure.  Stone is known for his paranoid style of direction, but it's usually effective in films like ""Nixon"" and ""Any Given Sunday.""  But in this film, he went to extremes.  ""Natural Born Killers"" is more like an acid trip than a movie.  The opening sequence is quite fetching, but from that point on I couldn't engage myself.  I had a massive headache after watching this film, and I got absolutely nothing out of it. The numerous cuts simply detached me from the story, for good reasons.  This is a well-intentioned but extremely annoying and highly pretentious satire that definitely didn't deserve massive critical acclaim.  Michael Bay's films have half as much cuts as this film, but he gets criticized for his style of direction.  Well, at least his films are usually fun to watch, despite being highly superficial.  The only part I enjoyed was the hilarious mock sitcom sequence in which Rodney Dangerfield plays the arrogant father. But if you have A.D.D. or you're on an enormous acid trip...this film will be an absolute treat.My score:  2 (out of 10)",Natural Born Killers

93,hall895,Media loves murder,7,21 July 2011,"Natural Born Killers is a bloody mess. And you can take that a few different ways. There is the obvious, the fact that the movie is drenched in gallons of blood, violent to the extreme. There is also the wildly chaotic visual style Oliver Stone uses to tell his tale. Stylistically the film is barely controlled chaos. Color, black and white, animation, film, video. And a sitcom parody tossed in too. It's a mess. But it works. More or less. Perhaps it would work a little better had Stone been a little more restrained. Instead he threw anything and everything at the screen and the result at times veers towards sensory overload. The story, and the film's message with which Stone was so concerned, at times gets lost in the haze of all the visual shenanigans. But Natural Born Killers is certainly an entertaining film and a powerful one. It's a movie not so much about murderers but about the media which makes the murderers stars. What hath our nation's media wrought? Stone gets his point across and manages to provide some great entertainment too. The movie certainly has its flaws but there's enough good stuff here to make you want to give it the benefit of the doubt.So apparently Stone was the one guy who watched Cheers and saw a psychotic serial killer lurking inside country bumpkin bartender Woody Boyd. What convinced Stone that Woody Harrelson was right for the role of psychopath Mickey Knox I'll never know but Harrelson manages to pull it off. As the equally psychotic and murderous love of Mickey's life, Mallory, we have Juliette Lewis who really revels in the opportunity to go gloriously unhinged and kick some serious butt. From our first introduction to Mallory it's obvious this girl is an unholy terror and Lewis captures that wonderfully. But while Mickey and Mallory are of course the Natural Born Killers to whom the movie's title refers other characters are perhaps more important in the way Stone presents his story. Mickey and Mallory can kill dozens of people, and they do, but it's not until the media latches on that the story really picks up steam. It's the media who make Mickey and Mallory stars, cult heroes. And the American public eats it up, can't get enough. Chiefly responsible for Mickey and Mallory's ascent to twisted superstardom is tabloid television journalist Wayne Gale. Mickey and Mallory are great for ratings and that's all that matters to the shameless Gale, played in gleefully over-the-top fashion by Robert Downey Jr. Speaking of over-the-top there's Tommy Lee Jones as a prison warden who is way, way out there. We also have Tom Sizemore as a detective seeking his own share of the spotlight. And even Rodney Dangerfield turns up, in a way you've never seen him before. There's a lot more here than just Mickey and Mallory slaughtering people. It's a movie about all the events which conspire to make Mickey and Mallory stars. And about what their being made into stars says about us.There are times when Stone comes dangerously close to losing his grip on the movie. He throws so much different stuff up there that there was no way it was all going to work. The Dangerfield bit for instance is exceptionally contrived. You wish that instead of veering all over the place Stone could have been a little more focused, walked a straighter line. But when the movie does work it works very, very well. Never more so than in the final act which is beautiful, glorious mayhem. Yes, this movie is a bloody mess. But that's not necessarily a bad thing.",Natural Born Killers
94,sharky_55,It's just murder.,6,27 December 2015,"Early on, the celeb serial killer couple stop at a roadside diner and order pie, and the bored waitress rattles on about the options, but then we switch to black and white, and there is a seductive twist to her words, and she spits them out with a devilish smile. And I thought there would be something interesting here, how Stone constantly switches between the colour and B&W stocks and rapidly contrasts perspectives. But that is all there is to that, because the rest of these switches are arbitrarily chosen, with no real distinctive reason other than to bamboozle. Stone couples these cuts with a change of distance and scope and zoom and of course angle - dutch is the favoured one for much of the film, and you will find yourself tilting your head as you try to orientate the frame's contents.Packaged with these are more devices that seek to parody the hyper-kinetic and frenetic nature of the 90s MTV culture; montages of increasingly ridiculous costumes and scenery exposed over sexual content, the soundtrack buzzing and fizzing like a radio on tilt, lurid tints of red and neon green bathing the frame entirely, broadcasting shaky stock footage through window panes, comically following knives and bullets whizzing through the air while opera serenades the murder, and sometimes the action slows to a hallucinogenic pace before kick-starting again feverishly. The first half of this film does not hold back, and is nigh incomprehensible. The second half allows for a little more clarity, and the characters are allowed to shine through, but every 3 shots Stone will still insist on tilting the camera to a 45 degree angle. And if you dare to complain about these stylistic choices, you will invariably hear the same defensive arguments; that parody is supposed to be extreme, that the whole point is to be messy and chaotic, that it is meticulously crafted and the work of a genius. The problem is that the satire is surface level at best, and despite persistently pressing his case and inducing sensory overload and nausea, the issue is treated with little tact or thought. To be fair, the performance are all brilliant. The pair of lovable killers, America's sweethearts, are delightfully deranged, and together they terrorise a rampant path. Their love is equally unhinged. But Stone asks more of them, and here is where it fails; having been taken in by a lone Navajo family, a mad dream causes Mickey to accidentally kill the father, and as they stumble out of the camp, Mallory screams ""Bad bad bad bad bad bad!"". There is no subtlety or characterisation here - this occurs after the sequence which digs (although not deeply) into her past issues of sexual abuse in the form of a sitcom, and the canned laughter chimes in incessantly. Don't you get it? She has been abused as a child and has been morphed into this strange monster, but she is still a human being! And so there is a smattering of remorse as they flee, and we are supposed to sympathise and wonder why the media has acted as an accomplice. Meanwhile, Stone distances himself from four dozen or so murders they have committed sadistically and without a hint of remorse, showing it via blurry surveillance footage or in a mocking re-enactment, so he does not actually have to breach the issue. The other characters suffer a similar treatment. Tommy Lee Jones' Warden McClusky is crotchety and whiny, and he plans a nefarious plot to murder the two with a similarly despicable cop, Scagnetti, who openly admits to crimes on a similar scale and is sexually consumed at the sight of a women. Stone ramps these characters to their extremes, so that as Scagnetti attempts to sexually blackmail Mallory, we are actually supposed to feel sorry for and side for her. And Robert Downey Junior's Gale is a fantastically performed character, adopting the dialect of shock jock Steve Dunleavy, and intentionally butchering and hamming up the accent to humorous levels of insane dedication all for the sake of ratings and sponsorships. As he interviews, he indignantly blasts the pair's crimes before winking once they cut for commercial (the Coca Cola polar bear making a cameo, and I think the film was correct in little areas - the Super Bowl has indeed become a massive television event, of close scrutiny, and its graphic violence, once needing to be censored, is now a dime a dozen), and during the chaos and violence of the prison riot, he is giddy with excitement, because all of this points to more publicity.Stone, I think, wants us to root for the pair in the final scene, like their hordes of American admirers. He does his best to; they grin and giggle as they point their guns, as Gale squirms and pleads that he, as the camera and surveyor, needs to tell the tale and bask in the fame of the entire incident. His character becomes a nasty caricature rather than someone in a sharp satire; he is drunk with vigour at the thought of so many people tuning in to watch the riot, and is made overly despicable as he attempts to come clean about an affair and instead loses both women. If this is what constitutes good satire - needing to ramp every character other than the actual serial killers to a impossibly nefarious level, then it is a disappointment. As we close, another montage shows Gale cackling evilly wearing devil's horns, and that just about sums it up.",Natural Born Killers
95,educallejero,Awful director ruins story with potential,1,16 September 2018,"I'm not offended by senseless violence. Even less so if there is a point. But here it gets to the limit of what I can support, because everything and everyone was just unlikeable, making it just pointless and boring.
And the same happens with the story. The director decided to make filming and editing experiments for no reason, destroying the heart of the story that is out there under the trash he created.
We watch two ""natural born killers"" and the irresponsable media reaction to their story. We have both characters origin and their relationship. And some of those bits are interesting. But the director invades it with pointless provocations and stylistic choices, making it seem that all that there is, is violence and dark comedy that is just not funny and boring.Watching it, I felt it was like a Tarantino movie but made by a mediocre Youtube influencer (there are really talented ones). Later, I read that indeed was a Tarantino script. I'm not even a real fan of his, but obviously he could've made a more coherent and watchable movie.",Natural Born Killers
96,aciessi,"Unrelentingly Disturbing, but Significant",9,25 June 2015,"Natural Born Killers is a film that almost doesn't need to be critiqued. It's already a critique in itself. A critique of how our hypocritical, scummy media at large sensationalizes psychopaths, murderers and serial killers. Oliver Stone rightfully gives the media a baseball bat to the head, in what I could only describe as ""propoganda-murder porn"". It's a 2-hour, vicious, ultra-violent montage that not even Sergei Eisenstein could've imagined in his worst nightmares. It's such an emotionally unshakeable experience, you won't be able to get your mind off of it. I don't know if I should consider Oliver Stone one of the great geniuses in all of pop culture, or a man possessed by the demon he has captured on celluloid. Be warned, at how brutal this picture is now considering the impact it has had on the impressionable sick-minds it inspired. Hauntingly, this movie accurately predicts and predates some of the worst atrocities in U.S history (ex. Columbine, Sandy Hook). To this affect, I can't say that what Stone has created amounted to any good at the end of the day.. but perhaps he knew that it wouldn't far better than we all did. It's no wonder why Quentin Tarentino wanted his name off of the picture. When you think about it, Stone took Tarentino's movement of comic brutality, flung it back in his face, with his own characters and said ""checkmate"".",Natural Born Killers
97,Stampsfightclub,A production marvel,8,18 December 2009,"Married couple Mickey (Harrelson) and Mallory (Lewis) travel across America leaving a wake of dead bodies behind, both spurred on by their troubled childhoods.Having watched True Romance a few days prior to seeing this for the first time I was geared up, in crime mode for a full belting actioner and I wasn't to be disappointed. This is a great exploration of various genres and an insight into experimental film production. For example the opening scene establishes the setting of America's countryside with some good mood settings such as landscapes and animals. Then straight into a café and Juliette Lewis is dancing solo to a song on the Jukebox. Some shots are shown with colour; others develop in black and white. There are numerous cuts and various weird angles and some brave moments of character establishment, which continue throughout the entire film. Then after a random loser tries to socialise with her she beats him to death and Woody joins in the mix and everyone bar them and a man are dead. This man, left alive to pass on the legend of Mickey and Mallory.Truly remarkable assassination sequences here and a gloriously effective POV shot of a knife flying through the window give off the vibe of the original story maker, Quentin Tarantino. This establishing characterization is quite something and as the film moves forward through a brilliant sequence in a car we dive into a replica of how the two met, in a comedy sketch no less.So within the first twenty minutes you will have never seen anything so unique in your life. I was completely spellbound because it was brilliant. However there is a major drawback with all this. You will have been so drawn into the marvel of special cuts and the production the story can take a back seat because of it. You are always wondering what will happen next? Why has the director chosen this shot? Why is this scene in green? And where there is no doubt in the brilliance of it all perhaps the story can suffer. There is simply too many ideas going on and the focus is lost.The plot, though slightly hindered, has plenty going for it. Like Badlands and Bonnie and Clyde, this is a tale of two murderers rampaging around America trying to get what they want, although this picture does have a better foundation for their reason. Through that comedy sketch at the beginning we saw Mallory's troubled childhood which sees her character develop into a woman pumped up on rage and violence. Mickey's isn't as concrete because we see brief flickers of images in his mind. Then through a completely exaggerated staged TV interview we get an unnecessary preaching destiny styled speech that makes it sound daft rather than religious. Thankfully this does not upset the balance of what preceded it and we can take stock in viewing a film that truly gave every single camera shot a working and with a lively script and well staged action montages it is definitely worth seeing.",Natural Born Killers

This is another of those films that was banned because of its controversial contents such as A clockwork Orange and The exorcist and when you do actually get to see it you realise that it should stay banned, not because of the violence but because it is total drivel. It's difficult to explain what Natural Born Killers is really trying to say because it is so wacky that it loses the viewer. Every Great Director , such as Oliver Stone , makes a turkey during his career and this is his. Even more irritating than the cartoon graphics and flashing lights is Robert Downy Jnrs accent. Where is he supposed to be from? I Hope he is not trying to put on an English accent , if so , its the worst since Dick Van Dykes in Mary poppins.

99,KnightsofNi11,Cruel genius,8,21 December 2011,"Here is what controversial filmmaking is all about. Oliver Stone knows how to get people talking and he certainly does with his brutally violent massacre film, Natural Born Killers. The film stars Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis as Mickey and Mallory Knox, a young and frivolous couple who go on a southwest killing spree which creates a media firestorm, inappropriately idolizing the two mass murderers. It's a brutal attempt at satire, examining the way we idolize those who do should not be given the attention they receive. It's a twisted and chaotic film that sparked a maelstrom of controversy which even landed Oliver Stone in court defending that the movie does not incite violence in those who watch it. This was because of the killing spree two youngsters went on after watching Natural Born Killers, creating a whole other story to go along with the film, raising Natural Born Killers to an all new height as one of the most controversial films ever made.You simply will never see anything quite as chaotic or disturbingly wacky as Natural Born Killers. With over 3000 cuts, the film is a sporadic and electrifying film that is in a million places at once. It uses all sorts of crazy color schemes and wild tilted camera angles that give the film a nonstop feeling of unstoppable chaos that only grows more and more harrowing as the film gets crazier and bloodier.Yet, while the film maintains this cartoonishly over the top rambunctiousness that is equal parts disturbing and entertaining, it also allows for a lot more to be going on underneath the explosive surface. Natural Born Killers is a deep and existential film that delves deep into the mind of madness and chaos, exploring the idea behind senseless killing. The film doesn't sympathize with murder, rather, it takes a close look at what insanity is capable of. It sharply examines the demons within all of us and how nobody is safe from insanity and we can all be victims and criminals at the same time. As Mickey Knox puts it, ""Nobody's innocent."" Natural Born Killers has no heroes and no villains. It takes a look at the grey area and takes it to hyperbolic extremes, making this film what it is.Natural Born Killers is part genius and part twisted evil. It has a clear message, but there is so much going on within the confines of this explosive film. You will never see anything like it, especially from a visual standpoint. But it is rare that you will ever see this kind of subject matter examined like this and, if you do, it will likely not be as impactful as Natural Born Killers.",Natural Born Killers

Winner of The Pasinetti Award for Best Actress (Juliette Lewis, who plays Mallory) and Special Jury Prize for director Oliver Stone at the Venice Film Festival. The version I saw of Natural Born Killers, was the unrated director's cut which runs four minutes longer than the theatrical cut. The film has some very stylish direction using LSD style sequences as well as using TV clips, animation and even using some black and white filming. The acting is all very good as well and is a nice film to look at cinematography wise. Where the film goes wrong is the script. The film starts out promising and has some very inventive and neat ideas which I liked but the film just started to go more downhill as it went along. There really isn't an awful lot to this film and after awhile all it feels like you are watching is just violent scene after violent scene and it gets tedious and boring. The film also tries to mix humour, action, romance and satire while making a point all into one film and it doesn't really come off working and in some ways I don't always know what they were trying to do. I understand that Oliver Stone, wanted to make a political point with this movie and it does to an extent and the movie is not terrible for reasons I mentioned above (mostly because of the look of the film and acting) but it just got tedious and almost annoying after awhile.

101,The_Movie_Cat,"""Junk food for the brain.""",4,20 May 2001,"The curious state of British censorship means this film can currently be shown on television but not released on video. A strange turn of events, as Natural Born Killers is less likely to induce mimicry of violence, but just irritate you to death. A mish-mash hybrid of Quentin Tarantino's 30-something pop culture references and Oliver Stone's middle-aged sensibilities it never really satisfies.Stone again mixes black and white, slo-mo, constant slanted angles, sped-up film, crackles, red filters, fades, off-focus, hand-held, animation, green filters, distortions, back projections, negatives, blue filters, strobes, stills, unsynchronised sound/images and reverse shots. About the only things he doesn't include are x-rays and an endoscope. Mind you, he always directs from his back passage doesn't he? Maybe that counts.Exceptionally irritating, most of the attempts at irony are just gratingly overstated. The motivations for the lead characters are unsubtle yet also underdeveloped. One shot sees the words ""too much t.v."" superimposed over their chests. This was probably Stone's desire, his film resembling the worst excesses of a cut and paste MTV. However, as a motivation it's only half-developed and the whole thing must qualify as possibly the most indulgent movie ever made.Lots of the actors, Lee Jones and Downey Jr. particularly, are seemingly encouraged to overplay their roles, with only the leads playing it straight. This perhaps leads to a dull ""who are the crazy ones in society?"" debate. The proportion that victims of sexual abuse grow up to become psychotic is also highly questionable.When Harrelson remarks that killing Downey Jr.'s character is a statement and that ""I'm not one hundred percent sure exactly what it's saying"" you feel that it's something Stone himself could have said. The second half of the film chronicles media glorification of violence, something the movie itself does, despite superficially condemning it.Quentin Tarantino has been very disparaging about the film, despite never having seen it. It's perhaps a little ungracious, but he certainly had a point. If nothing else, then he would never have opened and closed a movie with the sound of Leonard Cohen. 4/10.",Natural Born Killers
102,cchase,We Have Met The Monsters...And They'll Be RIght With You After This Commercial Break!,9,5 December 2008,"In your most feverish dreams - or nightmares - did you ever wonder what a movie collaboration would look like between Oliver Stone and Quentin Tarantino? Well, chances are that you've already seen it.NATURAL BORN KILLERS, the controversial, blood-drenched, blackly funny satire from 1994, was actually based on one of QT's early original spec scripts. Filtered through the sensibilities of no less than three different (credited) writers: David Veloz, Richard Rutowski and Stone himself, the whole affair still looks, sounds and even 'smells' like the PULP FICTION/KILL BILL wunderkind. You could no more erase Quentin's influence from this movie any more than you could have a Dracula or a Frankenstein movie without Dracula or the Frankenstein monster. (Well, a good Frank or Drac movie, anyway.)For those who have no idea what I'm talking about, NBK is a movie that redefines the ""chicken-and-the-egg"" question as ""Which came first...the killers or the violence that made them?"" And even then, that's simplifying the question too much.Critics waggled their own fingers and clicked their tongues about how Stone and the producers were hypocrites; indicting the media for making movie stars out of monsters with tons of hype and extremely gory violence, but then using the very tools it condemns to tell the story.So: are they right? I'd have to say to some extent - yes. But there is something undeniably compelling about watching two actors in roles they were practically ""born"" to play.NBK's demented all-star cast is led by Woody Harrelson (no 'CHEERS' moments here, folks) and Juliette Lewis (STRANGE DAYS) as amoral mass murderers Mickey and Mallory Knox, who fancy themselves to be a latter day ""Bonnie and Clyde."" Only problem with that is that by drawing comparisons to that Arthur Penn classic, it points out NBK's biggest shortcoming. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway's duo could still be viewed through a rose-colored patina of likability, due to the fact that they were primarily bank robbers, and the ""unfortunate"" casualties left in their wake were allegedly unintended. Mickey and Mallory have no such illusions...With any sense of naiveté burned away by their scabrous upbringings, they kill whomever and whenever they feel like it. As someone in the movie so aptly puts it, ""They just don't give a s---.""Stone (and by proxy, Tarantino) never forgets to remind the audience of their own duplicity in the equation by using mixed media formats in a way to propel the story that is downright unsettling. Mallory's appalling homelife is shown in flashes as the sitcom-from-Hell, a black little confection called ""I Love Mallory,"" which features Edie McClurg as her brow- beaten mother, and a nearly unrecognizable Rodney Dangerfield as her pusbag of a father, in a role that twists his nervous, everyguy persona into something lecherous and putrid. If you ever got the sense that the late comedian could turn his image on a dime into something truly vile and nausea-inducing, this role will confirm your worst suspicions. It's also a mark of how under-appreciated the man was as an actor.And so it goes, as stock footage, verite footage, news clips, animation and faux interviews are used to show how we maintain the care and feeding of the monsters we love, and how they return that appreciation by giving us more of what we want: carnage, carnage, carnage.In a completely off-the-wall performance, (and that's saying something in a cast that co- stars Tommy Lee Jones and Tom Sizemore), Robert Downey Jr. plays Australian media bottom-feeder Wayne Gale, who's fictitious yet suspiciously familiar-looking ""docu- tainment"" show American MANIACS leads and feeds the growing frenzy for ""Mickey and Mallory-Mania."" If (despite the accent) Downey's anything-for-ratings flack reminds you of Geraldo Rivera, Maury Povich, etc. - the resemblance is absolutely intentional. These are the kinds of talking heads whose tawdry shows have always immortalized and even glamorized the baddest of the bad. O.J., the Menendez brothers, Charlie Manson, John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer...hey, why not a gruesome twosome like Mickey and Mallory?With what we know about him now, the casting doesn't seem that far-fetched for Tom Sizemore, playing Det. Jack Scagnetti, an unhinged policeman who's been getting into his job of hunting down killers far too deeply for far too long. It's his M&M encounter that sends him sailing over the edge, cackling gleefully all the way.Which brings us to NBK's second problem: because the characters for the most part are so relentlessly, unrepentantly amoral or downright unlikable, you're left with virtually no one to identify with. Sure, you're SUPPOSED to feel for Mickey and Mallory. Two crazy, horny kids in love on a brutal killing spree? How could you not like them when you have to choose between professional leech Wayne Gale, closet serial sex perv and strangler Scagnetti, or Tommy Lee Jones' Warden Dwight McClusky, a man so unburdened with anything like a conscience or a moral compass, he makes Hannibal Lecter seem eligible for a Nobel Prize.In closing, NATURAL BORN KILLERS is definitely a well-made movie, undeniably well-acted and directed with the usual passionate, imaginative flair that we've come to expect from Stone (even if we don't always get it.) It should definitely be seen by movie buffs and the passingly curious alike. Just don't be surprised if you feel like spraying down your TV real good with Lysol when you're done.Oh, and just a P.S.: this review refers to the Director's Cut. The Extras will show you exactly what about QT's original script might have been toned down (the sequence with the bodybuilders is almost enough to make you want to turn it off!), plus for those completely bummed about the original ending - check out the Alternate Ending. Having Arliss Howard popping up from time to time in the movie as M&M's ""guardian angel"" Owen will suddenly make a helluva lot more sense.",Natural Born Killers
103,FilmOtaku,A bizarre acid trip of a film that has good and bad points,7,20 October 2003,"Oliver Stone seems to have outdone himself on this one.  Not only is Natural Born Killers a visual masterpiece, but it is probably one of the most insane and nonsensical social commentary films I have ever seen.  Disappointing, since it was penned by one of my favorite film directors, Mr. Quentin `Bad Motherf***er' Tarantino himself.  The elements of a good story are there: Boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love and go on a mass murdering spree which is lapped up by the media.  While there is definitely a strong social statement, the story is too erratic and scattered to be completely coherent.
Visually however, Natural Born Killers is stunning.  It is intensely colorful, unflinchingly violent and innovative in its cinematography. This movie is not for most, but if you decide to try it out, be warned:  It is not for the faint of heart, and not for the weak of stomach.

I doubt that I even need to name the director, since this is sort of his trademark. Oliver Stone strikes again. However, underlying all that is the fact that we, all of us, know that there are people out there exactly like these two. Some people just simply enjoy killing. And that's what scares us. It's why some folks really like films like this. It reminds them that they might be someone's next random victim. I have really mixed feelings.

That's basically the plot (escaping from jail).I rented `Natural Born Killers (NBK)' because it looked interesting; Great cast (Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Robert Downey Jr., Tom Sizemore, and Tommy Lee Jones), catchy title, and because I wanted to see how Harrison could play a cold-hearted killer.I go home, watch it.  I end up being disgusted.  I'm not disappointed, because I wasn't expecting a classic out of this one, but very disgusted. This film gross, and cold-hearted.I feel that Oliver Stone tried to make Mickey convince people that killing wasn't that evil; And after how many people Mickey and Mallory killed, I just stopped caring about them.  No pity, man.  Lewis isn't that pretty, and they tried to make her like a babe who kills people; And Harrelson's character cheated on Mallory by raping one of his victims.  It's pure scum. I didn't care what would've happened.  Maybe if Quentin Tarantino directed it, it would've been a whole lot better.Don't see this film, unless your a cult-film fanatic.",Natural Born Killers
107,tomimt,A somewhat failed satire,5,22 March 2006,"Natural Born Killers is a movie that has lot's of things to say. At least that is the basic idea seen behind the bloated mass of the movie.Mickey and Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelsson and Juliette Lewis) are two psychopaths, rummaging the America and randomly killing whomever happens on their way. We see flashbacks on Mallorys life before she met Mickey: how she was molested by her father in a screwed up home.They are chased by detective Jack Scagnetti (Tom Sizemore), who is a bit questionable law-enforcer himself. Later, when the couple is caught we meet sleazy reporter Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.) who sees the murderers as his next big break, as a personal key to everlasting TV-fame.The movie is bloated with stuff: references and ideas of the basic nature of men, of how we all are the Knox, if we are just given the right stimulant. But it's bloated way over the means of Stone's abilities to really direct this kind of a satirical view of hypocritical media controlled world, where a murderer can become a idolized star. The satire inside the film overflows and becomes meaningless inside of the pseudo artistic choice made by Stone. He points his finger many times, but as many times as he does it he as often looses the thing he was pointing.Not all the scenes are a miss. There are some effective, well done segments in the story and on the way they are portrayed. But those couple of scenes aren't enough to save the film as flawed as this.",Natural Born Killers
108,virek213,NATURAL BORN KILLERS--Pointed or Pointless?,6,27 July 2001,"Perhaps no other film made by a front-line director during the Nineties aroused as much critical and social invective as NATURAL BORN KILLERS did in Oliver Stone's hands.  Taking off from a script by PULP FICTION maestro Quentin Tarantino (who publicly disavowed any connection to Stone's film), N-B-K charts the course of serial killers (or is it mass murderers?) Mickey and Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis).  Their little mass killing spree occurs along old U.S. Highway 666 in the American Southwest in which they systematically kill more than fifty people before being caught by the law.But their story gains a hideous amount of media attention from a nation starved for entertainment of ANY, and I do mean ANY, kind.  Enter into the fray Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr., in a performance so deliciously over-the-top), a tabloid TV show host who interviews Harrelson in prison to milk the man's fifteen minutes of celebrity for all its worth.  N-B-K takes aim at everything America had become in the 1990s--obsessions with mass murderers, cops as violent, sadistic Gestapo squads, prison conditions, etc.But the question is, how relevant is NATURAL BORN KILLERS.  Is it, as Stone once claimed, a satire?  Is it pointed or is it pointless?The jury is still out, and there will always be debate about that.  For me, I don't know that Stone is saying anything about the media's obsession with sensationalism that wasn't predicted eighteen years before in NETWORK.  And while Stone has sometimes raised the name of Stanley Kubrick as one of his idols, he doesn't exactly have Kubrick's gift for cutting-edge satire as was shown in DOCTOR STRANGELOVE.  Practically everyone's performances here are so ludicrously over-the-top, perhaps none more so than Tommy Lee Jones as the deranged prison warden Dwight McClusky.  NATURAL BORN KILLERS, however, is unavoidably violent, and extremely so, with the bombardment of all kinds of music from retro-Sixties to Trent Reznor to Carl Orff's ""Carmina Burana"" on the soundtrack ear-splitting enough to induce a migrane!I'm giving this film a 6/10 rating, however, due to its craft and its montage editing, and its occasional inclusion of clips from other films like Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH.  It is not the total, violent, and immoral disaster that its detractors claim it to be.  But it isn't a masterpiece, either.",Natural Born Killers

That's how I'd describe the whole 2nd half of the movie: A damn quagmire! I honestly thought the movie was an 8/10 up until then.

113,Rickting,Satire at its best,9,27 July 2016,"Oliver Stone's sometimes funny, sometimes terrifying but always compelling satire of the mass media's obsession with violence tells the story of a couple going on a cross country killing spree. Natural Born Killers is incredibly over the top, it's loud, it's nasty and it's in your face brutal. This is balanced with the humour in parts, but more importantly the characters are developed and the film even makes you care about the murderers. Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis and Robert Downey Jr. all give terrific performances, and the frenzied, psychedelic and mesmerizing direction is hugely effective. The best thing about NBK is that it doesn't act like most films of its type. Most films like this go down the route of being highly difficult to watch, but this is disturbing because of the highly intelligent way in which it manipulates viewers' emotions, and by the end I was left feeling very unsettled. Despite this, it's a highly enjoyable and enormously energetic movie much of the time, and it never ceases to be fascinating and provoke thought. 9/10",Natural Born Killers
114,Aylmer,a love-hate kind of movie-viewer relationship,6,13 August 2002,"This was one of the first ""R-rated"" movies I saw about when I was 14 and it didn't really have much of an effect on me, probably because I saw it basically back-to-back with Desperado, Pulp Fiction, and a host of other violent movies that were all the rage at the time.  Sure it was violent and weird, and stuff, but far too long and drawn out to maintain the attention span of a 14-year-old.  I found the many parts of the films which go over-the-top and the weird editing to be juvenile and silly, even at that young age.Years later, I bought it on DVD as the ""directors cut"" and I must say that my impression is very different.  Personally, I am not too impressed with the overall film, but it has enough little touches to make it immensely rewatchable.  Scenes like the massacre in the cafe, the ultra-cheesy ""American Maniacs"" TV show, the stylish early scenes in the prison, and of course the chaotic ending riot set to the tune of both Pakistani music and ""A Night on Bald Mountain"" all combine to make this a truly memorable and entertaining film.  Most of the violence is totally unrealistic and cartoonish, as are most of the performances, so this really isn't the sort of movie to be taken seriously.  Stone makes a point of the media and bad parenting causing the young people of today to either become serial killers or worship serial killers... but it's pretty much lost among all the MTV-style editing. Personally, the editing is the main reason I absolutely love this film. Where else can you go to find shots cribbed from CAPTAIN SINBAD intercut with stock footage of nuclear tests, praying mantises, horses running in negative-colors, rabid rabbits, and world war 2; yet all put together fairly cohesively.  It's an absolute shock to the senses, and mixed with the graphic violence and cartoony performances, a film which you'll either love or hate depending on what kind of mood you're in.",Natural Born Killers
115,PIST-OFF,Director's cut way way way better.,10,13 May 1999,"Much like Terminator 2:Judgement Day this movie suffers a lot from editing. It's got alot of great scenes cut out. Including a horrifically violent courtroom scene in which Mickey kills a witness with a pencil, a hilarious ranting raving sketch by my hero Denis Leary, another hilarious but brutal scene in which two twin weight lifting actor brothers have they're legs cut off with chainsaws, Tommy Lee Jones's head being ripped off and slapped on a stick a more brutal opening fight sequence between Mallory and a hick, extra footage of Stephen Wright, and an amusing scene in which Mickey is chased away by a prophetic sheep. This movie featured more cuts than any other movie ever and has great cinematography which together result in a twisted acid laced viewing experience of extraordinary magnitude. The soundtrack has over 30 great songs. Great performances by Woody Harrelson (who has taken an odd twist from his sweet dumb guy persona on cheers) and Juliet Lewis (who specializes in playing girlfriends of Psychos). Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Downey Jr., and Tom Sizemore pitch in great suppoirting performances. Plus Rodny Dangerfield in quite possibly his funniest roll ever. Definitely his sickest at least. Plenty of great lines Oliver Stone does a great job at directing this. Seeing a Quentin Tarantino version would have probably been at least as interesting and completely different. Some people love this film and others hate it. It's very controversial and is often blamed by the media as a movie that sends kids off the deep end.

The violence ceased to be disturbing after a while. Screen violence is never really convincing, since one knows it is just a movie, and before long here it just washed over my head, and grew tedious. Only psychological torture actually hurts. The psychology here is limited to rather soppy romance, except in the case of Mallory's repulsive father, who got what was coming to him. The message of killing being naturally born was plain enough.Juliette Lewis was good in her part, and Woody Harrelson was OK in a less demanding role. However, Robert Downey Jnr, and the rest of the cast, when it came to the prison riot, were little more than a multiple pain in the neck. This was especially true of Downey and his twitchy face, which became exceedingly annoying and irritating. His would-be Australian accent seemed utterly pointless. The riot went on and on to no purpose, and while it may have entertained the public, when shown on television, it soon ceased to entertain me.

117,Al_The_Strange,"""It's just murder. All God's creatures do it.""",8,18 January 2015,"This might be the most psycho movie ever made. Not just because it's a movie about a couple who gleefully mass-murders people, but because of the relentless style. The movie is such a zany and noisy audiovisual presentation that it can be exhausting and nerve-wracking.Presentation is a large part of what makes this film memorable; from start to finish, it is a rapid-fire onslaught of images upon images that collectively tells the story of murder and mayhem. The editing is often brilliant in the way it juxtaposes related images in an expressionistic manner. It can also be very weird, especially when animation, black-and-white photography, stock footage, overlays, and bizarre background effects are used in such short proximity. If you can stomach the craziness, the film does have plenty of memorable scenes, including a kick-butt opening sequence, and a finale filled with all-out rioting and bloodshed.The story is pretty simple, but the characters take the front stage. You might think it's hard to relate to these brutal, twisted people, but their romance, rebellion, and carefree attitudes make them the most charismatic pair of criminals since Bonnie and Clyde. Thanks to the way the film is shown, and the way it dispenses pop-culture images all over the place, the film delivers an underlying theme of violence, and the way it's constantly exploited in the mass media to be delivered to the whole world as a product. It might be seen as pretentious and hypocritical that it's a violent movie preaching against violent movies. However, I don't see this as glorifying violence, since there's nothing glorious about it. It's a trashy and ugly affair, full of ugly characters and ugly acts. In the end, the film serves as a bold and shocking descent into the pathology of the minds of mass murderers, and perhaps also an exploration of the people who idolize them.This film has some incredibly crazy photography; the camera tends to float around each scene, with a lot of skewed angles. Editing is very fast and relentless, with each scene intercut with a myriad of different images. Acting is intense; Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis inhabit their characters perfectly, while Robert Downey Jr and Tommy Lee Jones are extremely batty in their roles. Writing is good. Half of the sets, props, and costumes used are rather cheesy and fake-looking, but then the other half tends to look gritty and more real. Music is often pretty loud and obnoxious, but it matches up with the film well.The style and violence of this film is incredibly dense and zany, but it is a heck of an experience that provides a stark expression of unbridled psychosis.

Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis play two lovers who were abused as children who now for some reason feel that the best way to spend their time is to travel around brutally murdering people. By the time they finally end up in jail, they end up becoming media superstars and worshiped. This film is basically a satire on America's fascination with criminals and nothing more than that.

120,Flagrant-Baronessa,"The 8th most controversial film of all time, according to Entertainment Weekly",9,29 July 2006,"Note: This is probably the longest review I have ever written and it mostly deals with the source of controversy surrounding Natural Born Killers, so if you just want a brief summary of why this film is worth watching, skip to the end!I remember when Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers was released in 1994 and delivered a well-deserved kick up the arse to American audiences. Stone set out to criticize media for its mindless glorification of violence and criminals in the media and did so through a sharp satirical spectacle about two infamous killers-turned-idols, starring the ""it"" actors of the early 90s. Unsurprisingly, conservative American families were outrageddisgusted at what was presented to them and saw the film itself as a mindless glorification of violence and criminals as opposed to criticism. Indeed, they were so outraged that, when teen-fans left their Oklahoma home to go out east and shoot fellow Americans, parents blamed Natural Born Killers for having inspired the shootings. Oliver Stone was left with blood on his hands, while more murders were being linked to his masterpiece. Lawsuits were filed; cases were tried and reinstalled, until finally they were dismissed in Louisiana in 1998. The reason I bring this up again, after so many years, and so many more violent films later, is because Entertainment Weekly has published a list of The 25 Most Controversial Movies of All Time and Natural Born Killers is ranked as #8. Now, I don't want to knock Entertainment Weekly as they report on reality, but when a film like NBK gets a high ranking as 8, they should be called Entertainment, Weakly. My point is, rather, that this is a film that dealt with such an important, realistic issue that it should never have been controversial in the first place. So why was it?The reason for this high ranking, I assume, is the ending of the film. Instead of opting for your typical, clichéd cop-out in which the ""good guys"" win and the ""bad guys"" are punished, Stone lets Mickey and Mallory Knoxthe glorified killersget away with precisely everything and ride off in their car on the highway. This was what lead to a public outcry and what caused an anti-violence film like Natural Born Killers to be mistaken for a pro-violence advertisement. Firstly, it is my opinion that audiences who need everything to be carefully spelled out for them in a film in order to get the message and morals right are probably devoid of morals in the first place (no offense, Crash (2004)). So because Natural Born Killers did not have a perfect righteous ending with a ""good guy"" shaking his finger and telling you that this was unacceptable and having the bad guy repent their crime, some people took this as homage to serial killers. This fills me with concern for your average movie-goer. Secondly, Natural Born Killers shouldn't have inspired this much controversy because, while it often exaggerates to get its message across, it is realistic to the coreand why should realism be labeled controversial? Isn't it just the opposite? Having violence in a film is a realistic portrayal of the world today. Having media glorify violence is even more so, because that is what is happening. By making Mickey and Mallory Knox into infamous symbols (""If I were a mass murderer, I'd be Mickey and Mallory!"" one worshipping teen tells the TV camera team), Stone is parodying reality. He is parodying the idea of media turning serial killers, like Jeffrey Dahmer, into celebrities. Dahmer was on the cover of new magazines more than once, for example. The prison interview with Mickey is based upon the Charles Manson interview with reporter Geraldo Rivera. The story told on ""American Maniacs"" about Mickey killing a cop after asking him for directions is taken almost verbatim from a story made up by J. Edgar Hoover in the 1930s about bank robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker in an attempt to try to silence the couple's growing fan base. In other words, no one can argue that Natural Born Killers is not a realistic portrayal of the media's response to criminals.Now thirdly, it is my guess that the film struck a little too close to home when it opened and therefore attracted unfair criticism. It pointed to things that were too familiar with audiences. Take the famous sitcom scenes of Mallory's family, featuring hammy acting, clown-like sound effects and canned laughter. All the stylistic elements were present it was just the content that was overblown; Mallory's father made lewd suggestions and it all culminated in a ruthless killing spree. Yet, somehow, it was still funny because it was so close to the average sitcom. This was Stone's intention. In prison, when Mickey is being interviewed on national TV, the film cuts to a simple black and white image of a typical American home. The family is sitting around watching the interview, glued to the television like mindless zombiesthe very same people who hated this film. That's biting irony.So, controversial? I have watched Natural Born Killers many times and cannot see anything else than a satirical masterpiece. I also do not think that exaggerating images or scenarios is overkill  I think exaggerating morals and 'happy endings' to get a point across is overkill. Natural Born Killers had the perfect balance and was meant to be taken tongue-in-cheek. It doesn't glorify violence; it shows how desensitized the media and the public have become to it. And it does so with flair and fury. 9 out of 10",Natural Born Killers
121,majikstl,The Worst Movie Ever Made -- Period!,1,3 July 2001,"Seriously, I can thank Oliver Stone because when people ask me what is the worst movie I have ever seen, I now have an answer. This movie represents the greatest waste of movie-making effort (not to mention my time) of any film I have ever seen. Director Stone tackles one of the most complex subjects of our time -- the relationship between violence and the media -- and has absolutely nothing original, insightful or even entertaining to say about any aspect of it. Instead, he tries to hide his shallow observations by filming every scene from 52 different angles and with 18 different stocks in a C-minus film student's attempt to dazzle us with his clever use of audio-visual equipment. What does he ultimately have to say? That the public is fascinated with criminals and the media feeds on this fascination. Oh, wow! Worse than the utter emptiness of his hyperkenetic film style is the contemptuous hypocrisy behind it all. He condemns the media for glamorizing violence and creating heroes out of psychopaths by making a movie that glamorizes the violence of his psychopathic heroes. Every act of murder in this grotesque satire is filmed like an MTV ballet of pop video clichés. The victims of the violence are treated like jokes or inanimate special effects props. He shows no more compassion for humanity then his ersatz hero and heroine. In wallowing in such violence -- make-believe though it may be -- he becomes the very sadism-loving showman that he so arrogantly seeks to condemn. ""But,"" he seems to be saying, ""I do it for art, not filthy commercial greed, so I am above reproach."" Stone may think he can stand back and be the aloof observer, free of responsibility, but as long as he perpetuates the glorification of violence he cannot claim the moral high ground. ""Natural Born Killers"" is an ugly, hateful, meaningless insult to the very ideals it pretends to defend. Like ""A Clockwork Orange"" (a better, but equally hypocritical film), NBK thinks that a few scattered high-minded platitudes can somehow overshadow the impact of its corrupt, brutal imagery. Pictures speak louder then words. Stone knows this, but pretends he doesn't.",Natural Born Killers

Galvanized by the editing and visual pyrotechnics of JFK, Stone takes his craft to the next level as he and his collaborators go to town on a story by Tarantino (who can not vilify this film enough) and switch the dial to eleven. DP Robert Richardson throws nearly every film stock and format ever conceived into the mix, and the electric cast have a field day.

Not of what the early 90s were like but of what they stood for and were preoccupied with. As such, this might be the last, truly relevant film Stone ever made, back when he was a force to be reckoned with and an artist who really did have things to say.Your ability to enjoy this while sober will depend on your capacity to enjoy a film for its craft and ideas as much as for its sole entertainment value.

Incredible piece of filmmaking, you would expect some level of wildness from Oliver Stone, but never to this degree. Normally, a movie that would deal with the story of Mickey and Mallory would risk telling the story with known formulas, and make this a 90's Bonnie and Clyde. But Oliver Stone is no normal filmmaker, and everytime he comes up with a movie, it has got to be a definite boom, and it has to cry out loud. And this movie cries out louder than anything you have seen the in the silver screen. Movies sometimes tend to slow up the pace somewhere in the middle, but this one never slows up or allows us to even breathe. Charging the viewer with set piece after set piece and with cuts after cuts, the result is a jaw-dropping two-hour-long montage sequence, that invades all the senses and is the closest thing to a film depiction of hallucinogenic effects. Probably, it is also one of the most violent films ever, but the irony that flows through this one won't let you stop and smell the flowers: just check out the ""sitcom"" sequence!

While it is true that it may have something to say - it is an overstatement of biblical proportions that it has ""lots"" to say.

Rather than castigate the media culture for raising the remorseless killers into some sort of folk hero status, Stone's film rather seems to half believe that they are worthy of such status and he often depicts their army of hapless victims as a gallery of grotesques that have it coming.The violence and imagery of the film is disturbing and not in a good way. There is literally no restraint or sublety...anywhere. Not in the direction, not in the acting and not in the - although I am loathe to use this term for this screenplay - writing. Whereas Bonnie and Clyde may have been romanticized for cinema, NBK's Mick and Mallory are appalling in every way. Certainly no one could possibly sympathize with them. They murder people for kicks and basically get away with it. If anything, the fact that the film has any complimentary critical accolades and supporters merely cements my assertion that if legendary lousy film director Ed Wood had been born later, he would have been deemed a genius. Stone's film is incoherent, rambling, overlong, largely pointless and drenched in violence. His imagery is completely foolish and oftentimes laughable. Characters will be sitting in a hotel room, while babies float by the window. While traveling down the highway, a giant monster stomps by the car. It is like Stone raided the stock footage department and pell mell superimposed it into the background of his wretched film. When depicting Lewis's crummy home life, the film suddenly takes on the guise of a bad TV sitcom. Stone apparently thinks these flourishes are brilliant, but they instead remind one of Woods' work - with Bela Lugosi narrating while stock footage of an unrelated cattle stampede is interspersed.Acting is universally horrible. Robert Downey Jr. probably comes off best as an Australian news documentarian, but even his work is spotty. Lewis, well on her way to becoming to go-to girl for white trash roles, is dreadful, and Harrelson manages to condescend to equal her every step of the way.Some people insist the film has a message, but the problem is that Stone makes his point in the first 30 minutes and spends the remainder of the running time sledgehammering it home. The point is not deep and the biggest problem is that Stone the filmmaker seems just as in awe of his murderous amoral central character as the film that supposedly derides their supporters and the society that makes them celebrities. Stone and his film has absolutely zero sympathy for the human wreckage that they leave in their path, which makes both the director and his production more than a tad hypocritical and ultimately pointless.",Natural Born Killers

133,Greatornot,Not exactly your average folk heroes.,9,27 September 2009,"This movie hits the spot. Another one of those movies that are timeless. Americans do not care where they get their heroes ,even if its born out of violence and murder. This movie was not necessarily pre internet,but about the onset of the internet, where the internet is irrelevant. Still this film showcased 2 young murderers , Mickey and Mallory Knox, that terrorized small southwestern towns in and around NM.Also you had intertwined were clips from the old TV shows, like Beaver. I guess Mr. Stone wanted to show how America is an obsessed TV society and feel insulated from the outside world. Deep movie with lots of symbolism. I digress. M and M were bonded by bad childhoods and somehow they become a twisted Romeo and Juliet. Notice the ironies when you watch this movie. Close ups of the dead animal on the pickup and various close ups and references to snakes. Basically Mr. Stone is bearing out that humans are no different than wild animals or reptiles. The acting was wonderful. Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Downey Jr. , Yes even Rodney Dangerfield in flashback role as the child molesting father of Mallory. These were articulate murderers that wanted notoriety. Thus they always kept around one person from their bloodbath rage to 'tell the story' of Mickey and Mallory . Robert Downey Jr. was excellent as the reporter looking for fame in using Mickey and Mallory for his own selfish reasons. Depressing film in the sense of how it views human nature. Sadly, though its on the mark. I can not give it a 10 because some of the happenings were far fetched. The movie had a spoofiness about it that holds well today.Remember too, This movie came out right before the OJ Simpson tragedy. Mr. Stone is even more genius than we realize and prophetic I might add. We are obsessed with murder and you will become obsessed with this film. Enjoy.",Natural Born Killers
134,werefox08,Stone Fails.........Completely,1,29 March 2013,"This Oliver Stone movie (written by Quentin Tarantino) is 100% experimental. Stone thinks if he goes ""way over the top"" in a story about two young lovers....who go on a killing spree, he will revolutionize cinema. It turns out to be a mega flop. When one thinks about the technology (and history) he had at his disposal, this really is poor movie making. This is cinemas Jackson Pollock. But, as art forms they are a million miles apart. Stone has made several good movies (without experimentation) and maybe he thought this was his ""Pollock"" moment. It really does not matter what drove Stone to make this utterly pretentious film. The important thing is...it is a complete bore.",Natural Born Killers
135,Jacques98,Just a cute movie with a trite Disney moral.,4,1 December 2008,"It's sad to sit here and read all the positive reviews of Natural Born Killers. I can understand all the drugged-up adolescents who mindlessly love itthey don't know any better. What I mean is, it's sad to see intelligent people who think this film is intelligent and a masterpiecethey do know better. I guess this is how low the entertainment industry has come, and I can't find a single film that expresses it any better than this one. By all accounts, this should have been a freaking amazing movie. It appears to have all the elements that makes movies like Pulp Fiction so amazing, and for the first half hour it was amazing. Then it became a carbon copy of every other movie just like it, and, dare I say it, completely unoriginal and bland.There are countless negative reviews because of the violence cheesiness, but this isn't one of those reviews. I'll talk about the violence later, but I want to get one thing clear right now. This is a negative review simply because Natural Born Killers lacks anything even remotely original or different or intelligent, contrary to the popular opinion. That is why it's bad. Does it have some entertainment value? Sure. But it's entertainment I've seen a thousand times before, in better movies.The directing style is a mix between Quentin Tarantino and Takashi Miike, but doesn't come close to the perfection of either. At times it's just so cheesy it ruins the entire mood. Oliver Stone relies heavily on surrealist imagery here that may seem completely original to the moderate movie watcher, but to someone who knows anything about fiction, it's old news. Very old news. Though Natural Born Killers is far from all-out surrealism, it uses the same old tricks that surrealist fiction has used for centuries. It makes the viewer think they're watching something original when it really is just using weird images to mask a painfully unoriginal plot. Without the directing, the bare-bones plot is your standard serial killer story that you could watch on one of the woman's television networks. Nothing more.The supposed deep moral has likewise been used hundreds of times. Media's fascination with violence. So what . . .? Media is obsessed with violence because the public is obsessed with violence because of human nature. Didn't we learn that in Sunday school before we were old enough to go to the bathroom on our own? It's nothing new. The ancient civilizations even knew it. It's no more intelligent for Natural Born Killers to repeat that than it is for me to repeat one of Newton's laws. I read one reviewer who said anyone who calls Natural Born Killers shallow has a shallow mind, but that's just paradoxical. It's not shallow for a person to realize something is shallow. Study up on your psychology, bud.On every level, minus maybe the directing, it's completely typical. Even the iconic characters are just typical rednecks with little personality. So what's the big deal with this movie . . .? The violence is even generic. After reading countless reviews, both negative and positive, making me think this was the biggest bloodbath on screen. Here's a big, loud: ""What a joke!"" I watched the director's cut, and I didn't even seen enough violence to justify this as a PG-13 movie. In fact, I didn't see any violence at all. Literally. Just like every other annoying kids-movie-in-disguise, as something even mildly violent happens (even a fist fight) the camera cuts away and looks at the wall or the floor or something else BUT the violent act. Every single time. Most gunshots don't even leave visible bullet holes or visible blood splatter. I'm not exaggerating in the least when I say there is more on-screen violence in the PG-13-rated James Bond movie, Quantum of Solace. And, seriously, compared to movies today like Saw III, Natural Born Killers Director's Cut is, as my title suggests, nothing but a fun kids movie. But don't take my word for it, I was an adult when I first viewed this. Instead, read the forums on this site and count how many 10 and 12-year-olds watched this and weren't disturbed in the slightest. The number is even higher than I estimated.Besides the lack of any on-screen violence, the supposed ""disturbing"" content wasn't disturbing, either. It's all just typical rape references and and lack of morality you can see in PG-rated westerns, not to mention modern cartoons. Sure, these are terrible things in real life, but as a desensitize society, this is no worse than a formal conversation. Dark has ceased to be dark to us in art because we've seen it so many times. But instead of try to re-sensitize our society by playing out things that are genuinely disturbing, Natural Born Killers once again just rehashes old clichés.And here is where I really drive the stake into Natural Born Killers. There is something that I have not seen a single review mention, and it's the fact that it fails as the parody it tries to be.Aren't parodies supposed to be so over-the-top that they point out a flaw in whatever they're parodying? Every single flaw I've just mentioned above adds to why there is NOTHING over-the-top about Natural Born Killers except the cinematography (and even that is a lot more typical than most people would expect).In short, Natural Born Killers fails at everything it tries to accomplish. It takes a very promising idea from Tarantino, then reverses it and ultimately ruins it by trying to be intellectual.4/10",Natural Born Killers

138,galileo3,"A frenzied, manic, bloody orchestration of piercing sounds and astonishing images...",4,30 December 2007,"NATURAL BORN KILLERS (1994)Cinema Cut: R Director's Cut: NC-17It's an unusual Oliver Stone picture, but when I read he was on drugs during the filming, I needed no further explanation. 'Natural Born Killers' is a risky, mad, all out film-making that we do not get very often; strange, psychotic, artistic pictures.'Natural Born Killers' is basically the story of how two mass killers were popularised and glorified by the media; there is a great scene where an interviewer questions some teenagers about Mickey and Mallory, and the teenager says 'Murder is wrong.... but If I was a mass murderer I'd be Mickey and Mallory'. Mickey describes this with a situation of 'Frankenstein (the monster) and Dr. Frankenstein' - Dr. Frankenstein is the media who has turned them into these monstrous killersMost Oliver Stone films examine the flaws of the America, the country that the director loves and admires. I guess 'Natural Born Killers' is about the effect of mass media, technology and how obsessive as a nation, Americans are (and most of the world) over things such as mass killers and bizarre situations.The killers played by Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) are executed astonishingly by two excellent actors who step into the lives of two interestingly brutal killers. Mickey and Mallory believe that some people are worthy of killing, perhaps in the cruel theory of Social Darwinism (survival of the fittest) - Mickey says in his interview in prison, that other species commit murder, we as humans ravage other species and exploit the environment; the script is interesting, but it is questionable how much this film amounts to, in the sense of making us think about society and human behaviour, rather than the intensity of a 2 hour bloodbath that we have seen.The last hour of the film takes place in a maximum security prison; we see the harsh realities of prison life; the attitudes of the warden etc;overfilling of prisons - maybe Stone is questioning the future, the path that society is leading to.Two other interesting characters; First, a reporter who runs a show about 'America's Maniacs' and is obsessed with boosting ratings, that he goes to any length to capture the story of Mickey and Mallory. The other is police officer Scagnetti, an insane, perhaps sadistic officer that is in love with Mallory - he also has some weird obsession with mass killers, since his mother was killed during the massacre at Waco, Texas by Charles Whitman.The cinematography is superb; different colours, shadows, styles create a feeling of disorientation; the green colour most evident of all is green, to resemble the sickness of the killers (in the drugstore when they are looking for rattlesnake antidote).The camera work is insane; shaky, buzzy, it takes some determination to get use to it and accept it. Highly unorthodox, psychedelic and unusual.'Natural Born Killers' does not glamourise the existence of insane murderers, it questions it and how we as the public may fuel this attribute...Although the above review sound quite positive, I did dislike the film. Quentin Tarantino, who originally wrote the script for the film, was not pleased with the altered screenplay and he asked for his name to be removed. I can see why. While mildly interesting at times, Natural Born Killers is a mess of a picture.4/10",Natural Born Killers

140,happyendingrocks,This killing spree has a killer soundtrack,9,4 November 2009,"In addition to being one of the most iconic films of the 90's, Natural Born Killers can also rightfully be considered the film that cemented director Oliver Stone's status as a gifted, albeit slightly insane, auteur capable of using the film medium to deliver damning essays about man's inhumanity to man, even as he satirizes his own message. In many respects, Natural Born Killers is an acid trip of jumbled images meant to entice the viewer into assigning meaning and symbolism to film-making tricks that are more likely present because they look cool and feed the film's music video mentality than because they have larger purpose within the scope of the movie. As a result, NBK is film that assaults the senses, its often-nightmarish juxtapositions of brutally horrific and deeply romantic sentiments forging a cinematic experience in which the sum total of these images is more important than their individual significance. This is to say that much of what we see in this movie simply doesn't make sense, but the senselessness is likely precisely the point.Nestled in this art film within an art film, there is a straightforward narrative of sorts. The pulse of the film is of course the love story between our titular Killers, Mickey and Mallory Knox, who spend a great deal of the film remorselessly executing random victims for sins ranging from deplorable acts like child molestation to decidedly benign crimes like giving bad oral sex. Stone's first big trick is to solicit our cheers for M&M, no matter what heinous deeds we see them commit. Whatever dicey logic we are forced to overcome here, Stone's ploy works, because in addition to being ruthless and cunning, Mickey and Mallory are also the most charming and likable killers we've ever seen, and the strength of their love amidst the bloody and tangled web they leave strewn in their wake is inspiring and, aw shucks, truly touching. Credit this to stars Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis, both of whom give career-defining performances and who display undeniable chemistry and passion that is essential to our acceptance of this duo despite their homicidal faults.We could demonize Stone and accuse him of swallowing his foot for admonishing our violence-endeared society for romanticizing mass murderers in an unabashedly violent film that romanticizes mass murderers, but the black comedy and satire elements in Natural Born Killers are simply too spot-on for us to accuse Stone of missing the mark by far. When NBK switches gears and allows Robert Downey Jr.'s film-stealing media parasite Wayne Gale to tell the tale of Mickey and Mallory, we have to concede that we, too, would likely plop down on our couches and revel in the unsavory truths of their killing spree, and the world-wide fanfare that accompanies the couple's murderous rampage isn't all that absurd when you consider that Japanese boutiques actually do sell Charles Manson T-shirts.There are many interesting subtexts hidden within Natural Born Killers, and this is certainly a film that lends itself well to repeat viewings. I've seen it at least 30 times, and I'm perpetually amazed that I still find at least one new point of interest every time I watch it.Upon the viewing that prompted this write-up, I deciphered a very subtle piece of information that I always puzzled over before. There is a scene that offers us a re-enactment of a chase between a Sheriff and Mickey and Mallory after the pair shoots a police officer. During the chase, as the two parties trade bullets and epithets, Mallory turns to a bicyclist pedaling down the side of the road and guns him down almost as an after-thought. As the cyclist tumbles down, both the film and the sound slow to a crawl, as if asking us to take a second and consider what we've just seen.As I took the second Stone requested, I starting asking myself why Mallory would draw her attention away from the pursuing lawman and open herself to his gunfire to shoot down a harmless bystander. Furthermore, in the heat of the battle, how did she even know the cyclist was there? Mind you, she had her back to the road as she traded shots with the Sheriff's car, so she had to turn around to level her shotgun at the cyclist. It was then I realized that it was not Mallory who killed the cyclist, but an errant bullet fired by the over-eager pursuing lawman.We view this exchange through the eyes of the media, and the idea of Mallory shooting down the cyclist both exonerates the police officer's mistake and further emphasizes the cold-blooded elements of Mickey and Mallory's cross-country mayhem. In this case, the ""facts"" are not true, but they make the story better. Therefore, the media's take is forever altered to more dutifully serve their vision and give their audience what they want to see.As with many parts of Natural Born Killers, my interpretation of these events is certainly debatable. But one of the most clever twists in Stone's odyssey is that the unexplained remains just that, and the viewer is not only welcome to invest their minds into the affair, it's practically demanded of us. Stone doesn't hit you over the head with what it all means. He expects you to come up with some ideas of your own. For better or worse, Oliver Stone is assuredly one of the few film-makers who consistently challenges his audience to invest themselves in his work. That challenge is never as labyrinthine, or as rewarding, as it is when applied to Natural Born Killers. Yes, NBK is violent, shocking, and wholly misanthropic. But this psychotropic bloodbath is also one of the most undeniably unique movie experiences you will ever have. And, more importantly, it's one hell of a fun ride.",Natural Born Killers
141,mistoppi,I wanted to love this film,4,6 May 2016,"I rented the director's cut and I'm trying to figure out what's the difference between the cuts, apart from being four minutes longer. Anyway, since I have only seen this cut, so I'll just have to go with this one. I was mostly interested in this film because of the original script written by Tarantino. Apparently the original however was heavily edited by Veloz, Rutowski and Stone, so I don't know what parts of Tarantino are actually left. I'd really like to read the original script, but I don't know if that's even possible.My dad actually gave me a warning of this film. He said it was extremely heavy and distressing. It definitely is, and during some parts of the film it's done marvellously. The beginning of the film is a good example. The dialogue in that is pretty regular, it could be the beginning of any movie. The dialogue is something we could hear everyday, that's not what makes it distressing. That's done with the music. I've never liked Leonard Cohen's music, but it definitely spices up movies by making scenes extra creepy. I've had the soundtrack of this movie for a while, and most of the songs sounded extremely good, but when I saw the actual film I was slightly disappointed. Apart from few, like Leonard Cohen in the beginning, many of the tracks are easy to ignore, as they give nothing to the actual story. They just are playing in the background. If Tarantino had got to direct the movie his way, the soundtrack would've been so much better.Also the cinematography makes the film unnerving. Fast shots, camera is tilted, some shots are in black and white... Let alone all the small symbolic things in between what's actually happening. The writing could be almost anything, cinematography like that does everything else. I've seen the same kind of visual side in Slipstream (2007). That movie was complicated anyway, so the symbolic fast shots of something random suited the film. The plot of Natural Born Killers isn't complicated. All that symbolism gets lost when the film isn't watched by someone who actually knows about symbols. Everyday watchers won't have time to analyse what a snake here and there means. If Oliver Stone didn't mean this movie to be watched by someone who doesn't want to analyse every little detail as an important symbol, he's pretentious. The way this film was shot is good: tilted shots, fast shots, black and white shots, the colours... Those work. But like getting random shots of something isn't always that necessary. It's kind of like Stone wanted this film to be way more artistic than this plot could be. The story is artistic in the way how it can be analysed, but that's it. There's no need to make it an art film. I wanted to like this movie, but it's hard. While it had everything I usually like in films, it felt too pretentious and overtly complicated. I was expecting something so much simpler and therefore so much better. And that's the reason why I'd want to see what Tarantino originally had. He's an excellent writer, and I feel like his original story was made into something needlessly weird. When you think about it, Natural Born Killers is a good movie, if you judge it like critics do and all that. In technical sense it's excellent and all that, but it's annoying to watch. Natural Born Killers isn't something you can just throw into the DVD-player and watch it when you have nothing better to do, you have to really, really watch it, and that might ruin a film a little. If it's on TV, you can't just start in the middle if you missed the beginning and so on. While I appreciate what this film is, I can't say I actually like it.",Natural Born Killers

It makes sense, given that over 3,000 cuts are used during the movie (the average being 600-700), but that is about the only thing that lines up.The first half sets a scene (supposedly), but I found it more grating than anything. You have no empathy for the characters, the wackiness is borderline headache-inducing, and the plot seems thin to say the least.Towards the latter half I did begin to engage slightly more, and I actually thought it was the best Robert Downey Jr performance I've seen; despite this, I was not convinced that this was anything more than an artistic experiment - and not one that needs repeating.",Natural Born Killers

145,kurciasbezdalas,Probably the most talked-about film in history of cinema,10,5 November 2008,"I've seen this film a few times and still not sure what to think of it. Is it a satire like some people think or is it ""A Bible of Terror"" like other's think? At first I thought that this is a satire, but it's obvious that it's much more than just a satire. Most people talk about some important messages than this movie brings us. One of them was that media is poisoning our minds and it's true but I don't care, if you don't like it than don't watch TV. I get another message. It's that everything in this world is the way it should be. And that people are the way they were born and the way society made them. Not much depends on us. This movie is also known for inspiring some mass murders and serial killers. So this movie is really something to talk about. Anyways it's also a very entertaining film full of action, beautiful visuals and some black humour. Woody Harrelson is a very charismatic actor though his popularity is very unstable but he's still one of my favorite actors. Juliette Lewis did great as Mallory Knox, she was very suitable for that role, very similar to her another role from movie Kalifornia. Other actors were good to, like Robert Downey Jr., Tom Sizemore and Tommy Lee Jones. I know that Quentin Tarantino didn't like the way this movie was changed by Oliver Stone and it's possible that Tarantino's version would be even better but I think than Oliver Stone did a great job too.

I get the message, but just felt a little lost and ridiculous at times.Woody Harrelson is great as 'Mickey Knox' and even though he's a total psychopath he is very charismatic.I get the message that we crave violence and can be in a way addicted to it, and so the film tries to portray this with excessive and unnecessary violence in a hypnotic manner. But does everyone have to be completely idiotic and incapable other than the two main characters?The biggest and best message in my mind was the Native American's story about the rattlesnake. Go ahead and nurse a wounded snake back to health, but in the end don't be surprised when it bites you. You knew what it was to begin with.

The music, the black and white shots, the cartoons, the slow motion, the casting of Rodney Dangerfield as an evil child molester, the incredible portrayal of a corrupted society spiraling down the toilet. Wow! Yes, Stone is a show-off and that is what he does in this film, shows off his talent, his ability to make a visually stimulating film. However, story is where Stone comes up short here. Stone set out to make a movie that showed how Americans have become so lost, that they glamorize the lowest dregs of society. In fact, they make heroes out of ruthless outlaws. Moreover, in the first half of this film, he goes about showing just how bad Mickey and Mallory (the two killers and stars of the film) are. They are evil, just plain evil. Sure, they have troubled backgrounds and can show moments of decency, but still. OK, I get the point, we do make stars out of dregs and idolize them in a sick kind of way and this is wrong. Stone was on the right path here. HOWEVER, what does he do in the end? He turns the two horrendous murderers in to just what society does, celebrities. What a cop-out!! We should not trivialize violence and glamorize villains? However, that is just what Stone does in the end. No, I cannot overlook that, regardless of how stylish this film was, the breakdown of the overall point of the story is inexcusable.

I think the two tools that stone used here was both based on the American attention span. The first was through channel flipping and then projecting multiple things on screen and not being able to focus on just one thing. I think it was clever and it brought into the movie that relationship with media with the viewer and did not just make it a movie where the blame the media. I really thought there was some amazing performances there and I loved Tommy Lee Jones over the top warden. Robert Downy is still up in the air whether I think he is a good actor or not. I need to see more movies of his before I can decide. I think the dialog when they actually stopped to do it very nicely written and well executed. I like how there was no mistaking the heroes and the villains in this. The whole time I was cheering for Mickey and Mallory and I think the director did a good job of making the viewer drawn to them and what they stood for. Il liked the soundtrack a lot and the use of any Rage against the Machine with Leonard Cohen in the same movie is something to be respected. I was reading some of things that IMDb considers mistakes and it was obvious that they did not get it. I am not saying that this is the best movie ever and some of scenes were really well done and as a whole movie experience it was a great vision, but as a whole the movie was a little too over the top. I realize that it was supposed to be, but I think the message would have been a little more effectiveif it was not o over the top. My favorite scene in the whole movie wasthe Roger Dangerfield scene where it was set up like a sitcom. I am all about a message, but for me it was made over and over again and I think it might have been interesting if one could have seen some of the scenes play out in a more realistic fashion.",Natural Born Killers
153,thefan-2,Extremely graphic but make yourself watch it,9,19 May 1999,"The tenderness and affection Mickey and Mallory show for each other is the most shocking thing about this movie.  The self-enclosed little world they inhabit together never changes -- it's filled with all the love and forgiveness no one else will give them.  But the instant they look outside, their thoughts turn to violence and murder.  You don't want to meet them, you can't be ""nice"" to them in any way that will save your life. Two more horrifying creatures were never filmed, and we have Oliver Stone to thank. I give it a 9 out of 10.",Natural Born Killers
154,Jonathon_Natsis,Romeo and Julietwith guns.,8,2 February 2011,"Directed by the man comically referred to as 'the most dangerous filmmaker on the planet', Oliver Stone, Natural Born Killers could, very seriously, be the most dangerous film of all time. Never one to avoid controversy with preceding films like Scarface (1983), Platoon (1986) and Wall Street (1987), Stone caused his biggest storm yet with this hardcore satirical comment on the relationship between the media and the violence that feeds it. This twisted, extremely graphic film centers on Mickey and Mallory, star-crossed psychopaths who decide they've had enough of people putting down their relationship, so they naturally embark on a cross-country murder trip across America to profess their love, with media heavyweight Wayne Gale following their every move, turning them into media superstars in the process. The uniqueness of this film in almost every aspect is added to by the respectable performances of each cast member. Tommy Lee Jones' prison warden is a prime example of how overacting in a film can be excused if the construction of the character calls for it (see: Tony Montana), while Rodney Dangerfield is menacingly brilliant as Mallory's lecherous father, so much so that you, as the viewer, will find yourself almost cheering when he meets his demise in an appropriately graphic fashion. As citizens of this country, it's very easy to criticise flavour-of-the-month Robert Downey Jnr. for not exactly nailing the Australian accent required as Wayne Gale. Despite this setback, he contributes positively to each scene; none more enjoyable than when he finally cracks and lets his 'inner demon' get the better of him during the action-packed climax. Naturally, Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis run the show as Mickey and Mallory Knox. Harrelson's performance becomes infinitely more enjoyable if you've seen Zombieland (2009) beforehand, where it becomes obvious that Tallahassee is just a caricature of Mickey. Don't get me wrong, both characters have a sense of humour, but that dosen't mean Mickey will make you laugh. Coming off a subtle and criminally underrated showing in Cape Fear, Lewis gives a career-best performance as the unconventional femme fatale, stealing every scene and bringing to life one of the greatest roles ever written for a female in doing so. With the impressive variety in acting out of the way, it is the cinematography of Natural Born Killers that gives it its exclusive look. Stone and Richardson lay a no-holds-barred attack on the senses, switching frequently between technicolour, monocolour, black-and-white, animation and back-to-front projection. One does get the impression, after a while, that this is just done without purpose, but a little bit of research proves that each physical change in the film's appearance symbolises a different aspect of the themes being pushed.Too often, film connoisseurs get swept up with two very irrelevant outcomes of Natural Born Killers. Firstly, the influence that this film has had on society (i.e. encouraging mentally- unstable people to commit crimes) may be substantiated, but should not be included in a critical review, which should instead focus on the film as a stand-alone piece of art. Second (and I must admit I was once encompassed by this way of thinking) is the well- documented fall-out between Stone and scriptwriter Quentin Tarantino. While many of the scenes and dialogue from QT's original script are retained, an exact copy of the original tells us that Tarantino intended to have Wayne Gale as the centrepiece character, and I don't believe the film would have had quite the same impact if Harrelson and Lewis were forced to take a back seat to RDJ. And let's not forget, after consciously separating himself from any involvement with the film, QT released the masterful Pulp Fiction that same year. If he can move on, maybe everyone else should, too. In a single sentence, Natural Born Killers is a quirky, art-house film adapted for mainstream audiences. In retrospect, I've probably gone somewhat overboard reviewing the acting aspect of this film, but that wouldn't be the case if I didn't think those involved were impressive and innovative in their performances. Definitely not for everyone, but appeals to the evil in all of usand dosen't Stone know it.",Natural Born Killers
155,RickHarvey,Visually appealing,8,30 August 2010,This film is most certainly visually appealing with the constant change of colours and the so often presence of moving images against the ceiling and walls. This may lead to major distractions . Everything is interesting but is it effective upon your first viewing?. The truth is is that you will most likely need to watch it more than once to fully appreciate it but after the first viewing i'm not all to bothered about it anymore.It a totally different movie experience in which you will either love or hate. Everything is so surreal that you can't dig into the minds of the two killers . The whole tale is about how the media can turn notorious killers into iconic figures amongst the citizens but it takes a whole hour before the media spotlight is introduced . Before that we watch these two killers do nothing but kill in cold blood.The finale was shot brilliantly but everything just seemed to fly past my head. I would recommend it for the visual experience alone and for the few laughs that this gives. Also credit to the brilliant acting,Natural Born Killers

Contains some of the most graphic depictions of violence and mayhem ever captured on film and certainly lived up to its reputation in that respect. But the 60s-style filmmaking (black and white, 8mm, and film alternating) gets repetitive and whatever point Stone was trying to make (i.e. The OJ Simpson trial, which was going on when this film was released) is lost in this sea of disturbing violence.

Quentin expressed his dislike for the film. The original story Quentin wrote was much different if you read the original script. That being said this is still a unique and very weird film.

159,cofemug,"Interesting, thought-provoking",10,3 February 1999,"I can be honest and say that I am officially jaded to violence, sex, and other forms of indecency...and I am only 17.  NBK did not do this to me, everything else in the world did.  This movie shows what is wrong with society.  However, those of you who do not like to think about movies, and like to be entertained with mind-numbing pieces of happy-happy, will think that this is pure and utter crap which is just sensational violence for money's sake.  I do not think so, and I say to you is stick to your type of movies...maybe ""Patch Adams"" is more to your liking?I love this film.  I saw it for the first time staying over late at night at a friend's house in ninth grade.  I did not know what to think of this movie.  My friend thinks that it is just gibberish.  He is not smart, and I will say it.  I did not have the chance to watch it again for two and a half years when i bought the director's cut in eleventh grade.  I love this movie.This movie shows the killer's thoughts and motivations.  They were jaded by reality, whereas I am jaded by fiction.  Mickey and Mallory became killers because of their culture, and the rest of society.  In the first scene, they killed perverts and voyeurs.  Everything was justified to them.  I am one of those extremists and think about killing many people at many times. Sometimes, I think that it is even justified.The reason this movie is not just pure violence for its own sake is that is seems to reflect the state of our society when it was made.  Nowadays, there are less publicized serial killers.  Manson has been glorified to unknown heights by the media.  I even knew that he was somehow related to Helter Skelter before I knew that it was a song.  Axl Rose used to wear Manson shirts on stage, and later made a song by him.This movie was hypocritical in that it criticized media's exploitation of violence by showing massive amounts of it.  I think that some level of hypocriticism is needed when criticizing the media.  If you want to do that, you have to use some form of media, hence you're hypocritical to the people who operate on obvious levels.In conclusion, this movie is, like me, all media and hollywood, take away the good parts, with the exception of love, and crank the volume higher than it can go.  Love is its redeeming quality.  Fate played a major part in this movie.  Watch the Indian scene for that one.  If this is part of the problem, I would like to hear some suggestions on how everything in this movie could be fixed for those who need solutions.  There are no easy answers.  10 out of 10.",Natural Born Killers

Savage, shocking, and merciless are but a few of the phrases which can be used to describe this film.As many of you doubtlessly did before me, I rented it out of curiosity-I wanted to see what all the fuss was about! I stuck it into the VCR with some apprehension, anxious to see it, yet a bit nervous-I wasn't quite sure what to expect, despite having read Roger Ebert's excellent review beforehand.To my pleasant surprise, I actually liked it! I found it to be a daring media satire and a memorable viewing experience. Granted, it doesn't always work in it's individual moments, but overall it's pretty good, especially with that cast! Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis make THE perfect outlaw couple who have no morals .I admire the scene where Woody's character (Micky) is interviewed in prison, where he claims he simply has ""a certain purity"". I do NOT agree with the sentiment, mind you, but it sums up these characters' attitudes perfectly.Tommy Lee Jones is great as the crazed prison warden (""Destroy them!""), and the casing of Rodney Dangerfield as Juliette's (Mallory's) abusive dad is 100% pure genius! And did I mention that the scene is done in sitcom style, complete with canned laughter???Of course, you can tell it's an Oliver Stone movie just by looking at it. It's full of every cinematic trick in the book and then some.  Earlier on, I had seen ""Nixon"" and ""JFK"", and I must admit his style takes some getting used to, but once I got around to seeing NBK, it wasn't really a problem.If you think you can take it, see it!

And I never thought Mickey and Mallory were serial killers to begin with...I think they're actually angels of death who were eventually rewarded for their work with not only their freedom, but a family as well.

163,NateManD,The most breathtaking major studio film I have ever witnessed!,10,28 July 2005,"It's been said that director Oliver Stone was experimenting with mushrooms when thinking of ideas for ""Natural Born Killers"" I think Oliver Stone should do more mushrooms and do another 20 films like this one. NBK is simply amazing. It fuses together elements of dark comedy, satire, 70's style Psychedelic imagery, and a little Roger Cormen like exploitation. Many complain that Tarrentino's script was ruined by Stone. I disagree, Stone has created a disturbing, surreal masterpiece of uneasy laughter and shocks. The story is a satire on the media's obsession with serial killers. Micky and Mallory Knox are a crazy couple who drive across America killing various people. The performances by Woody Harrolson and Juliet Lewis are excellent. Their characters were abused as children and well it... screwed them up! They kill for kicks, but most of their victims are very unlikable people. The couple become celebrities and people cheer for them like they would for a Hollywood couple. The media basically helps to sell their image for ratings and profit. What I like is that the film shows that police and authority can sometimes be worse than killers. This is evident with Sgt. Scagnetti (Tom Sizemore) and the redneck prison warden (Tommy Lee Jones). And you can't forget annoying media whore Wayne Gayle (Robert Downey Jr.), who joins in the killing during the prison riot. ""Natural Born Killers"" is blood filled, violent and chaotic. Many critics didn't get it. Too Bad, because it's actually pretty funny in it's mockery of media and institutional hypocrisy. Because of its satire, this is probably one of the most risky Hollywood films ever made. Do watch, and make sure it's the director's cut!",Natural Born Killers
164,claudonio,My head is still spinning,8,18 September 2000,"I just finished watching ""Natural Born Killers"" and my head is still spinning. The film's dizzying portrait of two lovers who go on a cross country murder spree is intoxicating. Director Oliver Stone's use of different film stocks mixed with animation and stock footage is actually clever, it lessens the impact of the violence in the movie, though this movie is not as violent as it was made out to be. Behind ""Platoon"" and ""JFK"" this is Stone's best work. I think ome critics misunderstood the films fancy editing and critized Stone for being an egomaniac. People felt he was showing off what he could do as director and that the movie had litle substance. I really don't understand the controversy over this movie's violence, ( I have seen horror movies which had more violence) ""Saving Private Ryan"", while being a superior film had 5 times the amount of carnage the ""Natural Born Killers"" did, and yet Stone had to edit the movie 7 times to get it passed for an ""R"" rating. I highly recommend this movie.",Natural Born Killers
165,DeuceWild_77,Stone establishes a parallel between the pureness of love and murder in this dark humour satire about a homewrecker couple on the run for a killing spree...,9,21 September 2019,"I'm gonna start this belated review of one of the best films that came out in the 90's, referring to the Quentin Tarantino's backlash against this work of art and some other users here that carries him like if he's some sort of a Messiah of the filmmakers.First of all, like every other work penned by Quentin, ""NBK"" and Tony Scott's ""True Romance"" ('93) are part of the same 'original story', which QT blatantly 'borrowed' from three cult classic films (the first two of them are 'genre' masterpieces) based on real life facts: Arthur Penn's ""Bonnie & Clyde"" ('67); Terrence Malick's ""Badlands"" ('73) and Steven Spielberg's ""The Sugarland Express"" ('74).Secondly, Quentin himself wanted to direct it, but was obliged to sold his 'original story' that captured Oliver Stone's interest and after re-wrote the screenplay (we thank him for that) he made his own movie, because it's an Oliver Stone's directed film, which means Oliver's vision, not another aimed for teenagers rip off flick directed by the former videostore clerk who stole it from 10 other better films made prior, that the general viewers seemed to forget (or don't even known) their existence.Thirdly, after the ""Man in Black"" Johnny Cash himself met Tarantino and told him ""NBK"" was the best film featuring his name in the credits and loved it to death, QT changed his initial reaction to bash everything about NBK (he went as far as forbid his 'stock actors' to appearing in it, think Tim Roth & Michael Madsen, threatening both of ban them from his future films if they agreed joining Stone's project) and reconciled with both the movie and its director only several years later.Tarantino's bitterness aside, and now focusing on what really matters, ""Natural Born Killers"" is a psychedelic ride, a visually intense movie experience that not only entertains the viewer, but it's also very smart in its intentions.
Stone's provocative style of approaching a subject matter never was so out of control, but at the same time, dashingly effective on its satyrical tone as in ""Natural Born Killers"", an acute criticism on glamorizing violence and its perpetrators and the media role of expande and overpraise it to a point of turning serial-killers and mass murderers into rock 'n' roll stars.The movie may be full of excesses and gratuitous violence (but much more suggested than showed), is not for everyone and wasn't intend to be, it hits you like a punch in a face, and at the same time embraces you in its wicked love story and makes you laugh with tons of dark humour, including a humorously staged segment envolving middle-class suburban life allegory projected like if it was an old 50's sitcom, one of the highlights of the film.The editing is energic and hallucinating; Stone's usual collaborator Bob Richardson's quirky camera angles were then creative and inovative enough to establish a new visual style that predicted the nowadays oversaturated shacky cam / 'flashy' mainstream films and Stone's direction is nothing less than mad genious, he always knew what he was trying to achieve.In terms of acting performances, Woody Harrelson as Mickey Knox is everything what Matthew McConaughey tried later on to accomplish with his on-screen persona, he's natural in his craziness, self controlled over-the-top sometimes, both creepy and goofy, manly & childish, but hypnotically appealing.Fresh from her Academy Award Nomination in Martin Scorsese's ""Cape Fear"" ('91) and the similar themed movie, ""Kalifornia"" ('93), which was, like ""NBK"", based on the real life case of the Starkweathers' infamous killing spree, Juliette Lewis, plays Mallory Knox, Mickey's fiancee, with daring sensuality, tons of riot girl / punk rocker attitude and that rock star aura in her movements, dancing & singing that led her to form a rock 'n' roll band years later, ""Juliette and the Licks"", when the movie career went off the tracks. She plays here the opposite of her naive character in ""Kalifornia"" even if both characters came from the same background of broken homes.The well-casted supporting roles include Robert Downey Jr. as Wayne Gale, the 'Gordon Gekko' of the TV Hosts; Tom Sizemore as the slick / sociopath cop, Jack Scagnetti, a role tailormade for him; Tommy Lee Jones, re-teaming with Stone after ""JFK"" ('91) and the previous year, ""Heaven & Earth"", as the Warden Dwight McClusky, looking and acting like if he was the indie director John Waters on acids and the legendary stand-up comedian, Rodney Dangerfield as Ed Wilson, Mallory's abusive father.The soundtrack featuring Leonard Cohen, L7, Cowboy Junkies, Duane Eddy, Patsy Cline, Patti Smith, Jane's Addiction, Nine Inch Nails, Lard and Bob Dylan are among the best that came out in the 90's.The deleted scenes featured on the DVD and Stone's own director's cut of the movie shows some poignant scenes that were left out in the cutting room floor for reasons of lenght and pace, including the infamous trial scene, featuring Rachel Ticotin & Ashley Judd; the Dennis Leary's interesting monologue and a hilariously made segment with Peter Paul & David Paul, the former wrestlers 'The Barbarian Brothers' turned actors, playing the Hunn Brothers, the surviving amputated victims of Mickey & Mallory's outrageous rage.
There's also an alternative ending featuring the guardian angel. played by Arliss Howard in an extended appearance, the strange inmate who helps Mickey & Mallory evade from the prison.In short, and now quoting: ""Tarantino disowned the film, saying, ""I hated that movie. If you like my stuff, don't watch that movie."" Well, Quentin, i don't like your stuff, but i'm in love with NBK since it was released and in years to come it will be more praised and highly regarded than yours, ""Death Proof"", ""Django Unchained"" or ""The Hateful Eight"".Kudos to Oliver Stone, my vote is a 9 !!",Natural Born Killers

I mean, just for sickening starters, there wasn't one, single, solitary character in this entire film who was even remotely likable.As an offering to the masses, Natural Born Killers was director Oliver Stone's perversely twisted satire on America's insatiable infatuation with crime and brutality.With a bludgeon firmly in hand, Stone delivered his derisive points on the subject of media-mania early on in the film. The rest of the picture was just a madman's fury, all hollow, reverberated echo, over and over and over.Even the hyper-kinetic, psychedelically inspired, 60s film-making style of Natural Born Killers became boring and repetitious far too quickly.Prior to its initial release back in 1994, a whopping total of 150 cuts to the final product were ordered before Natural Born Killers could receive an ""R"" rating.",Natural Born Killers

But this is just a nasty romp with endless color-shifts and gratuitous mind- bending effects. It's like watching a dream, not stark reality, which takes the effective tension out of it.The characters create little empathy for their tragic childhood cause, and I see no purpose to the material as satire, either. The sheer scale of the killings overwhelms the supposed deeper message. OK, some people are twisted, now what? If anything, this movie is a parody of Hollywood itself, where too many plots are based on psychotic behavior that takes no real effort to write. ""The Last House on the Left"" (1972) is the closest thing I can compare it to.I'm baffled as to how anyone but a drug-addled weirdo could enjoy this film enough to watch it twice, as some have claimed is necessary. It's just too Helter Skelter, even if some bigger message is present. Stone has done much better pictures. That it was ever critically acclaimed is the scariest thing about it; as a reflection of its makers and viewers.",Natural Born Killers
169,Chrissie,Is this what all the fuss is about?,1,3 May 1999,"Lots of quotes come to mind after trying to watch Natural Born Killers.

I think of Lizzy in Pride and Prejudice running down the stairs when summoned and concluding, ""Is this what all the fuss is about? I had thought that at least the pigs had got into the garden.""When Alan Parsons wanted to tinker with quadraphonics,he gave us the wonderful musical money-sounds intro to Pink Floyd's ""Money."" It IS possible to experiment without subjecting your audience to every cockamamie notion that wanders through your head.

170,unakaczynski,Tarantino and Stone together? Sounds like a dream!,8,30 December 2005,"Natural Born Killers Drama/Black Comedy Like I did with Minority Report as my first, finally, review of a Steven Spielberg filmI'm also finally reviewing an Oliver Stone flick. And I've started with arguably his most violent and sadistic film. A film that tries painfully hard to be so over-the-top that at times, it's downright difficult to watch. Top it off with the story coming from the maw of Captain Dementia himself, Quentin Tarantino, and I was pretty sure I was in for a good, psychotic, violent time.This is basically the story of a lunatic couple, something along the lines of Bonnie and Clyde, but ""cranked to 11"" and high as a kite in the sun. Woody Harrelson and Juliet Lewis play our psychotic ""Bonnie and Clyde"" duo who's love for each other is only matched by their love of total, hair-raisingly blood-thirsty mayhem. Robert Downy Jr. apparently managed to stay sober enough to actually have a role in this film as a sleazy television news exploitationist drooling to do a story on Mickey and Mallory (Harrelson and Lewis) because he's a sucker for higher ratings. The film basically chronicles the last days of their depravity-laden freedom, their capture, and their brief incarceration. All of it covered with a fine coating of sadistic, violent, cruel, inhuman behavior towards pretty much everyone. But, let's not forget, there's that love story quality hidden beneath those gallons of blood!Here's the breakdown:The Good:--Well, I'm a horror fan and a gorehound. So I'm a fan of movies pushing boundaries of sheer violence and gore. And this movie had violence. And it had it in spades.--Generally, pretty good acting, with an interesting flavor to it all.--Fantastically wild cinematography and artistic style. Very over-the-top and flashy. Also dreamy and tensethis film passes itself off as some sort of hellish, barbarice, drug trip perhaps Downy was lending a hand to more that just acting here This is rampant cinematography that has to be seen to be believed or really understood. Unbridled zoom shots, quick flashes from color to black and white to grainy old color to grainy older black and white, with some shots still in negative form coupled with quick flashes of violence, bloodied Mickey, or flashback montages. This film has a lot of energy.--The tense, dark atmosphere through and through really carries the characters through their trials and tribulationsand near endless homicides. --Generally, good use of sound.--Entertaining ""segments"" of the film themed differentlynamely, the ""Mickey meets Mallory"" scene set up like a ""Married, with Children""-style sitcom, but far nastier.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--The story itself is really nothing too special. This film is sold on the cinematography, style, and shocking violencenot so much the substance. We've seen better versions of this kind of story in other places, for instance, another penned by Tarantino: ""True Romance"" is a better story, with deeper characters.--Not a whole helluva lot of character development, some minor depth, but for the most part, these characters are 2-dimensional at bestonly Mickey and Mallory have any amount of depth given to them, and even that seemed a little thin. We have one ""thoughtful"" scene near and during the film's climax with Woody Harrelson's Mickey, and a few flashbacks to troubled childhoodsbut that's about it.--Some decent music choices and some odd ones.The Bad:--The extensive violence will be as much a turn-off for some people as it is a turn-on for others.--The wild, flashy cinematography can get to be too much after a whileit's like watching a music video for two solid hours, and often times detracts quite a bit from the dialog. The film's intense imagery and energy can be drainingalmost physically exhausting to someafter a while. This easily tops the ""crazy cinematography"" that Rob Zombie tried, and generally failed, to pull off in ""House of 1000 Corpses.""--Pretty much every person in this film is a horrible, psychotic, or depraved human wretch. Not quite as bad as the truly awful human qualities crammed into the ""people"" in the ""Creature Features"" remake of ""How to Make a Monster,"" but still pretty low.The Ugly:--Depending on the individual, a whole lot of this film is ugly.Memorable Scene:--The climax in the prison.Acting: 8/10 Story: 6/10 Atmosphere: 9/10 Cinematography: 10/10 (Will not be to everyone's liking) Character Development: 7/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 8/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 3/10 (Very brief nudity, but a decent amount of other sexuality) Violence/Gore: 9/10 (Tons of violence, tons of blood, very very little actual ""gore"") Dialogue: 8/10 Music: 7/10 Direction: 9/10 Cheesiness: 2/10 Crappiness: 1/10Overall: 8/10What's that you say? Something wrong with my Violence/Gore setting? Think it should be a ""10?"" Well, you clearly haven't seen the multitude of depravity I've witnessed in years of horror film addiction. ""Evil Dead"" and ""Dead-Alive"" (""Braindead"") both easily top this film in pure violence and gore. Let's not forget ""Day of the Dead"" or ""Zombie"" (""Zombi 2"")both also much higher in the violence/gore department. But don't get me wrong, there's tons of violence in this film, particularly during the climax in the prison. That said, you gotta be a sucker for bizarre, extremely violent, sadistic films to really enjoy this oneso it's not for everyone. The wild cinematography will be a turn-off for a lot of people as well. So, take the psychotic drug-trip induced visuals of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" and combine it with the rampant violence of most any given war film, remove a lot of character depth and most any heart or humanity and you have this film.www.ResidentHazard.com",Natural Born Killers
171,Det_McNulty,"Oliver Stone's Recipe For Disaster Remains Essential Viewing, Even When It Is A Complete Catastrophe",10,3 August 2007,"Media outrage followed the release of Natural Born Killers, a film of much controversy and delayed release, whereby months of extra editing had to take place to satisfy American censors. Countries such as Ireland banned the film for years, newspapers, magazines and critics would accuse the film of ""warping the fragile minds of its viewers"" and censorship boards would force cuts upon the film. The reputation of the supposed social-commentary was tarnished by its gratuitous, juvenile and artificial presentation. Very few people commended the film as a ""social-commentary depicting the immorality of our time"", but rather hailed it as an excuse for lashings of ridiculous extremity. Debates still rage today within the film community today; with a number of film-buffs claiming it to be a masterpiece and others ranking it among the worst films ever made. Ultimately, Natural Born Killers is a film of mixed views, being one of the definitive ""love/hate"" films. I am within the latter group of that ""love/hate"" equation.The corrupt media -the group Natural Born Killers most vigorously attacks- are the ones who were the most affected by the film's blatant criticism of modern society's obsession with degeneracy. This is one of the few things I respect about the film, the fact that it caused the media to realise what the film was attempting to say behind the horribly rambling front-layer of emotionally deficit narrative. If it was not for the fact that Natural Born Killers was so poorly executed and absent of understanding then the film might have been recognised for being the imperative social-commentary that Quentin Tarantino had originally intended with his story. Regrettably, Quentin Tarantino was for financial circumstances- obliged to sell his story, a remarkably inventive idea which could have spoke something vital of today's fast-food culture.Natural Born Killers is a film which refuses to comprehend the art of subtly. Although it can be argued that the film's repetitive fallacy and inappropriateness echoes that of a television show, does not mean that Oliver Stone should feel the need to consistently do the same just for the cause of cramming a message down the viewer's throat. I have always felt that Oliver Stone lacks the ability to create a work which is shrewder and less manipulatively persuasive in its approach towards sensitive and focal themes of the modern world. I would be lying not to say that I consider him a one-note, manipulative and constrained director who lacks the talent to acknowledge a problem through a more graceful use of vivacity. Films, such as, Oliver Stone's political epic (JFK) and eyewitness-take on the Vietnam (Platoon) could have been genuine cinematic achievements if it was not for this overly intoxicating style of execution.Here lie the primary flaws of Natural Born Killers, how its craftsmanship destroyed the film's possibility of being socially gratifying. The film is certainly not conventional, which is a remarkable talent for many films, but not in the case of Natural Born Killers. The potent combination of dark humour and exaggerated realism is overused beyond belief, crafting everything in a manner which is ill-suited for a film of its archetype. The film charades the supposed eccentricity by deliberately prolonging every aspect through gauche, uncoordinated camera positions and absurd cutting techniques and camera spins, which will regularly place subliminal images during intense sequences. The editing just makes the viewing more painful and successfully produced tedium of mind-numbing incapability during my viewing experience. The humour is tasteless, providing me with more reason to consider the film inexplicable. Blundered misconceptions occupy the running-time, with the backfired ""meaningfulness"" becoming a deranged opportunity for Oliver Stone to exploit his themes and then claim his film to be speaking about society's ethnicity.More than anything I find it disturbing that Oliver Stone's is so noticeably opinionated that he gets away with conveying the ego-driven media and cruelty-driven law enforcement as inferior than the senselessly gawky killers portrayed on-screen. The fact he attempts to make them intelligible people who do at times have a meaning behind their actions is utterly ludicrous. The pseudo-sophistication that kicks in during the prison scenes leads the film down a path whereby any distant respect I might have had was inconceivably destroyed. The film exaggerates and misfires all facets, from the mockery of replicated modern culture (such as the neon ""DRUG ZONE"" store logo), to the notoriously chaotic, ""acid trip"" editing.Yet, even with the almost incomprehensible idiocy of Natural Born Killers, there are still some impressive features that can be found beneath the havoc. Examples include the soundtrack, which is used to an excellent degree of suitability and helps add an extra taste of pop-culture to the film's inapplicably strained style. The acting is more than satisfactory from Robert Downey Jr, who offers a great depiction of a stereotypically frenzied, self-indulgent television buffoon. Tommy Lee Jones also provides a role of flamboyant zest, portraying a somewhat insane prison officer. However, the film's two main stars (Juliette Lewis and Woody Harreleson) do not perform to an even adequate level, with the exception of Woody Harreleson who at times does show aptitude, but usually outweighs his performance through an unconvincing approach.It may sound strange for a film I share such an intense dislike for, but I would be prepared to view Natural Born Killers again, partially due to it being a film of wasted potential and also for being a film where -because of the laughable faults- there is a lot to digest. Personally, I believe that this is not contradictory (considering my hate), but shows that I believe the film had the opportunity to be something, which is evident during viewing. It is sad to think that a premise of such capability lost everything due a director's lack of attentiveness and talent. Still, Natural Born Killers deserves to be seen, so that you can acknowledge how it had the potential to become something truly groundbreaking.",Natural Born Killers

Christley,"Preemptive satire (a rare commodity, indeed)",10,3 June 1999,"On my list of the decade's ten best films, ""Natural Born Killers"" takes the #2 spot (behind ""Schindler's List"", if you're curious).Oliver Stone shows here, if in no other film (with the possible exception of ""JFK""), that he has mastered the medium of cinema.  He's said exactly what he wants to say, exactly how he wants to say it.  It's a thrill ride, it's numbing, it's depressing, it's shocking.  And with a fraction of the usual hubris we expect from Stone.Juliette Lewis gave a mesmerizing performance, Woody Harrelson is excellent, and there isn't a false note struck by anyone else in the cast, either.  Oscars should have been given to Robert Richardson for his photography (just thinking about his limitless creativity with this film amazes me), and to Stone for his phenomenal directing job.",Natural Born Killers
173,TheAnimalMother,"An Exploited Kiss, From The Devil They Born!",9,3 November 2009,"Many have been quick to judge NBK as a senseless exploitation film that glorifies violence. When in fact the film is quite obviously a jab at news media and the Hollywood T.V. and film industry for their lack of true depth, and insane glorification of brutal violence. The very propaganda that has led to an extreme level of desensitization for a large percentage of the general public, and as a result, an inevitable increase in violent crimes. For years, Hollywood and other media outlets have been glorifying violence as a progressive means to an end. To the extent that even our own news media reports almost exclusively from the point of view that war is often necessary, and can lead to a positive outcome. While Oliver Stone's film is filled with over the top violence and hilariously profane dialogue, it strikes a very true cord in its symbolic and open references. NBK also poses interesting questions about the natural instinct of murder, and the overly programed thoughts and reactions of a deeply fabricated society. Mostly, Natural Born Killers is a satire of exploitation, to kick dirt in the faces of the senseless and irresponsible. Not that they would understand the film of course, nonetheless, Stone's bulls-eye is squarely planted on their foreheads. NBK is certainly an entertaining and thought provoking film for open minded individuals. The film is filled purposely with larger than life characters that are wonderfully performed by some of Hollywood's finest actors. Most notably...Tommy Lee Jones, Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Robert Downey Jr., Tom Sizemore, Edie McClurg and last but not least, Rodney Dangerfield. While NBK certainly is a film that exploits violence, no film this interesting and thought provoking really qualifies as senseless.""Doesn't anyone out there in Hollywood believe in kissing anymore?"" - Mickey Knox9/10",Natural Born Killers

175,andrewmerritt-31652,Bonnie and Clyde on speed,9,25 November 2019,"Natural Born Killers stars Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis and is directed by Oliver Stone. The story follows Mickey and Malory Knox's journey as they steal and kill people and later become a media sensation. Mickey and Malory Knox are like the 90s Bonnie and Clyde if they did lots of cocaine and every other drug I can think of. Natural Born Killer is a twisted version of Bonnie and Clyde as Oliver Stone takes two popular figures and turns it upside down. The story was originally written by Quentin Tarantino, but Oliver Stone hijacked the script and turned the script into an out of control roller coaster. This movie is complicated to follow so I'm going to do my best to break it down. The main key element is the media and how the media corrupts everyone, but not Mickey and Malory since they are already corrupted. The media turns Mickey and Malory into a media sensation with a large cult following. The media makes Jack Scagnetti (Tom Sizemore) into a heroic detective who is secretly psychotic and deranged. And Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.) represents the media as innocent and pure. But even something that's innocent and pure has a demon lurking inside of them. The plot may seem simple, but it is far from it, as I have no idea where the script is going. One minute we go from a dark 1950s sitcom to commercials, and finally to the story of Mickey and Malory Knox. But based on everything I saw while watching Natural Born Killers my representation of this film is I picture myself watching T.V as well as the rest of society. I think the message that Oliver Stone was trying to make is that society is fixed on their T.V's so much that they ignore the rest of the world until Mickey and Malory Knox came along. I think that's one of the main criticisms is that people don't really understand this that they're afraid of exploring it further. Even I don't understand it, but I find myself watching this in the near future coming up with my own conclusions. Overall, this is an out of control, insane movie that can be interpreted in many forms that I myself didn't understand. I couldn't tell if the script is genius or that Oliver Stone did a whole bunch of drugs and went all out. I personally found the movie to be entertaining that I felt insane as well as every scene and dialogue is bizarre, but in a good way.",Natural Born Killers
176,writerasfilmcritic,"This Sick, Twisted, Depraved Movie Is NOT Art; It is Evil",1,17 August 2006,"Despite the testimonials of the participants in this highly offensive and extremely indulgent exercise, it is not so much ""surrealist art"" as just plain slop thinly disguised as art. It's not for ""sophisticated audiences,"" either, unless that's what it takes to sit through a courtship of evil by a group of misguided devil worshipers. Somehow, I think these people are unaware of what they've actually concocted here, and what a sham for Oliver Stone, who is capable of inspired effort, to serve up such gore-filled refuse and talk about it as if he had created something wonderful. And what a waste of half-decent acting talent. Their performances were way over the top, especially in the case of Robert Downey Jr. and Tommy Lee Jones. The former, that insipid little turd, couldn't have been more annoying (""genius"" my rear end), while Jones, never one to play it low-key and understated, sprayed so much saliva in the faces of anyone near him that it's a wonder somebody didn't sock him in the jaw. In the entire movie, there were perhaps one or two half-interesting scenes, the first being the opening sequence in the roadside café, when the girl suddenly and unexpectedly starts kicking ass on the surprised redneck, his partner gets carved up with a Bowie knife, we watch as the same knife is thrown through the window in slow-mo to strike a third man in the back, and the waitress watches as a spinning slug approaches her face, once again in slow-mo, before it blows her brains out. It was all downhill from there. Did I actually hear Oliver Stone decrying excessive violence in films and offering this rank stench of a movie as some form of critical commentary about the phenomenon? Geez, what hypocrisy. This ragged, rotten, rancid vehicle reminds me of everything I hate about the Hollywood establishment and the media in general. They play with fire and pretend they don't even know it. After slinging this pound of scalding hot crap into the can, to then advertise the stinkin' thing as something only enlightened viewers will understand and appreciate is the height of desperation or self-delusion. Just think, all the power of modern movie making was put into the hands of people who spent lots and lots of money and all they came up with this wet fart of a flick. Hide your heads in shame, people. This vomitus should never have been made, and once it was, it should have been dumped into the nearest incinerator and the burner turned on high. It's sick, twisted, depraved, and worst of all, BORING.",Natural Born Killers
177,jonathandoe_se7en,See it after you've watched JFK (1991),6,2 September 2001,"In the same way Oliver Stone's JFK was suggesting a different background to the Kennedy assassination, so is Natural Born Killers suggesting what the media is capable of. I don't think Stone is saying, this IS what the American media does, he's just weighing up the odds. Still, with that out of the way lets get down the issue, is Natural Born Killers a good film? Well, not entirely. It's thought provoking and the most you could call it would be different, but the film is very heavy-handed and also many of the scenes are in the worst possible taste. Stone uses actual stock footage of holocaust victim and real crime scene photographs, and one has to ask Stone weather he realises that his film is exactly the kind of thing his film is attacking.I've often thought it very ironic when a film maker uses a film to condemn another film; this is why movies like Funny Games and Man Bites Dog don't work. Stone however seems to be having a great old time splicing together his multi-media style opus, mixing colour film with black & white, film with video, 35mm with 16 and 8mm, you can call the film a visual head f**k, but because the morals are so messed up it's hard to take seriously. The performances are OK, Harrelson and Lewis are taking the whole thing very seriously (I have nothing against them personally but they're not greats) whereas more talented actors such as Tommy Lee Jones, Arlis Howard, Robert Downey Jr and Tom Sizemore seem to be playing it more deadpan, creating an odd juxtaposition in mood.Another problem I have with the film is Stone's editing techniques, I think I've reached the maturity in my life where I don't need a visual interpretation of each word of dialog, I'm not kidding, if someone says the line ""shot in the head"" stone shows a two second scene of grainy war footage, depicting a man being shot in the head, it gets very tiring very quick. I'm not going to dwell on this being based on Quentin Tarantino's script either, because it may be misleading to people reading this comment, instead I'll just say that despite the flaws in the film, the real irony is that in some way Stone got it right, when the film was released the media caused a Sh*t storm of controversy, with accusations of Stone glorifying violence, much like Stone had predicted with the film in question. So because of our over bearing media, a slightly mediocre film, actual gains some kind of social importants.Only in America, 7/10",Natural Born Killers
178,Manthorpe,"Beautifully over the top destruction and violence, ala media mockery.",10,29 June 2004,"Definitely and positively not for everyone with it's gratuitous and extreme violence, Natural Born Killers still manages to find it's way to hearts and minds of those who love movies. Oliver Stone, with the help of a story written by Tarantino, shows us once again that he likes to take hallucinogenic drugs while filming....giving the viewer a true treat straight from the screen. We've seen this before and got a taste of it in The Doors, but here Stone is really able to take it over the top and with reason. Strange lighting, off center camera angles, moving and disturbing back drops, and cut scenes of violent images and cartoons that help express the emotion for the story is what it's all about. Some don't like the film simply because of that but I happen to love it and find it quite suiting. Not only that, it is quite an insane, sick, and perverted film that is difficult to watch so it's no wonder it's not widely received.The acting is second to none, an all out picture perfect cast. Harrelson, Lewis, Downy, Sizemore, and Jones all give unforgettable performances that come burning off of the screen and into your eyes. One of Stone's true talents is his ability to get his actors to give the performances that are best for the film, as we have seen many times in the past, and it is utterly undeniable here. All five give absolutely flawless performances for their equally disturbing characters. The film's premise if over the top, and naturally so are the characters and everything else in the film.The whole premise for the film is that the media glorifies violence and murderers, and NBK mocks that fact into oblivion beyond the infinite. For a film to mock the blood lust of the US media, what must one have? Violence, and there's buckets of it here. Everything in the film, including the violence, is over the top to try and express this point about blood lust and is why a lot of people find it hard to watch. Completely understandable. This applies to myself in certain scenes. However, it's also too bad for those who simply can't bear it because many like myself consider this to be a great film despite it's graphic nature. I feel it loses many points in some viewers eyes simply because the film is perfectly disturbing, twisted, and sometimes sick to make it's statement. It's either that or the fact that people have trouble identifying with the main characters and don't know why they should feel remorse for them. That's the whole point, you're not supposed to feel remorse for them or any character in the film! It's simply stating that all people can be inherently evil on some level, just look at all of the characters, and some people are not as evolved as they'd like to think...which also ties into people's desire to glorify violence and killers in the media. Some might find this ironic or contradictory. I do too, but think it's quite humorous. The fact of the matter is, there's not any finger pointing going on here, it's simply an observation made of the public that has been exploited to display it.Mind-boggling film technique, incredible acting performances, a strong message that ironically must contradict itself, and with a masterful director at the helm, NBK adds up to one extremely entertaining and great film. One of the strangest films I've seen. Love it or hate it. As a fellow reviewer previously stated, a nearly impossible film to review. See it and decide for yourself, if you think you're up for it.Highly misunderstood, but also highly recommended.",Natural Born Killers
179,Stibbert,Great movie about this screwed up world!,7,6 September 2005,"This movie brings up several important issues about todays society. Does this movie make too much use of violence. When it first came it brought up a lot of debate. Some refused to show it because of it's violence. When I saw it, I wasn't shocked by it and I found that frightening. However, it made me start to think about the world we're living in and the power the media has to affect peoples meanings and opinions. This movie is one of the most anti-violent movies I have ever seen. Some say it is just violent, but I clearly see a anti-violent message in there along with criticism of the media making heroes without thinking about the consequences first. While some action movies got you all worked up with all the shooting and heroes this movie just makes you sit there and think: ""What the...?"". It may not rise as much debate today, as we are getting used to more violence, but it certainly opens you're eyes and it's criticism of the media is now probably even more topical then it's ever been.I think Oliver Stone did this Tarrantino story very good. On the other hand there was some elements I found confusing and effects I didn't quite get the meaning of. However, this is one of them movies you can watch several times and still see something new each time. This is probably not the last time I've seen it.The acting is great. There is really not much more to say. The casting did a good job finding the right actors for the roles and the actors deliver.The cinematography is also very nice done. There are no boring or unnecessary shots and the lightning is just magical. The change between color and black and white is also nice. You notice it at the beginning, but then the you don't notice if the color is changed from green to red. It all just seems natural and right at the moment. It's the same with the sound. You notice some songs, but mostly it's just there creating the atmosphere just as it should.This is a movie everyone should see.

Oliver Stone was sued by parents believing that the film had inspired kids to murder each other. The question I have about that is why were the kids allowed to watch the movie.

I see that a few people have said it is the worst movie ever. Two people even commented on the acting being bad. Let me ask this : WHAT MOVIE DID YOU PEOPLE WATCH?!? Natural Born Killers was one of the best- acted films of the 1990's, and Stone's direction was innovative, brilliant, and exciting. The satire was unending and obvious, just like the atmosphere of violence. And that was Stone's intention. That's what movies are SUPPOSED to do : make you react. I personally fell in love with Mickey and Mallory, not as people I'd like to be around, but rather as fantastic, fascinating characters. And that's another thing Stone does intentionally : he makes them characters, not realistic imitations of people. The cartoon superhero images didn't get there by accident. Perhaps what many disliked was that obviously Stone fell in love with them as well. Instead of allowing them to be made examples of for the purpose of his satire, he allowed them to become heroes, and they win in the end. But here we are again at what makes movies great. YOU NEVER KNOW. When I first saw it in the theater, I was very surprised when they actually survived.

184,mgtbltp,Natural Born Killers (1994) Noir on Acid,9,8 April 2016,"A surreal, satirical, Neo Noir, sensory overdose. A psychedelic, acid road trip to Hell. It's a bizarre black comedy satire of the American 24 hour news cycle celebrity/violence culture, much in the vein of Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) satire of mutual assured destruction, and A Clockwork Orange (1971) satire of ultra violence. Believe it or not I'd never seen this film until last year. I hadn't even heard of the controversy surrounding the film. I can see why though. It's because it hits too close to home, it's too real, it touches a nerve, there's an inconvenient veracity of cause and effect to it all. Is it Nature, a frightening genetic component of human beings that is in all of us. Or is it Nurture, as is illustrated through the fragments of flashbacks we get of Mickeys and Mallory's abominable family life, that causes them to go off the rails, if the wrong code buttons are pushed? I've been going through the Neo Noir lists from various sources and either viewing or acquiring those titles that I'd either never heard of or just missed. I believe my experience of watching this was all that more enhanced since I've begun delving into Noir and Neo Noir so heavily. This personal steeping in everything Noir has given me a huge visual catalog of cinematic memory ripe for discharge. This film may not work the same going into it cold turkey. Natural Born Killers, gets my synapses sparking. My RPMs are red lining. Like a delayed strobe the film sporadically flashes between Black & White and Color film, it has these insanely canted Dutch Angles while at other times they tilt, back and forth, teeter-totter like along with other visual Noir stylistics. It uses documentary style footage and live breaking news parodies, animation, TV sit com satire, super 8 film sequences, TV quasi News Special Bulletins, and music video style promos. It is hyper violence mixed with cultural and natural Iconography all in a assault on the senses. Every potential affront to sanity and integrity is exploited. It's an indictment of the media feeding frenzy we have with disasters, mass murder, terrorist attacks, and public executions. It's INSANITY, with a complimentary soundtrack, and it's as American as apple pie. They got their kicks on Route 666. Our tale begins with the desert and a montage of natural born killers, a wolf, a rattler, a hawk, it then segues to the human kind. Natural Born Killers is full of these little ""just killing"", (as Donald Trump uses the phrase) picaresque noir vignettes and others, that flesh out the characters and propel the tale forward, that stick in my mind amidst all the designed chaos. Here is one can call Mallory The 1990s Femme Fatale, where a jealous Blondie-Mallory goes off half cocked away from Mickey. During a love making session Mickey is paying more attention to the pretty hostage they have tied up in their motel room that to her. Mallory ends up seducing a town pump gas jockey on the hood of a Corvette in the garage bay. She hops up on the hood of a Corvette Stingray and wants him to ""go down"". He starts to do so but loses control jumping up on her. Mallory frustrate-edly pushes him off pulls a revolver out of her bag and blows him away. She then grabs her shed panties and flings them at the corpse exclaiming ""that was the worst head I ever got""! and stomps off. Other times these vignettes are just brief homages to the past cinema. When Mickey and Mallory are dancing at the diner the sequence changes from full traditional lit color to a silhouette reminiscent of Astaire & Rogers Musicals shot in low key chiaroscuro. We also see Horror and Monster movie clips. The vast pans of the Southwest deserts, and a prison farm escape during a Wizard of Oz tornado, recall countless Westerns. Again, over all, Natural Born Killers is not about Mickey and Mallory but about the infamy of their killing spree and the nutjobs they attract. A Geraldo Rivera inspired TV expose program American Mainiacs, is hosted by a shock journalist Wayne Gale who affects a Robin Leach accent and provides a live Lifestyles of the Depraved commentary on the hunt for Mickey and Mallory, their capture, trial and a year later on a prison riot. The program as Wayne Gale puts it is "" for all the morons watching out there in zombieland."" Tom Sizemore is Jack Scagnetti a high profile celebrity cop, author of ""Scagnetti on Scagnetti"" who is seriously warped. Tommy Lee Jones is redneck Prison Warden Dwight McClusky and Everett Quinton is Deputy Warden Wurlitzer who does a pretty good impression of Hugh Cronyn in Brute Force. You'll find yahoo's on either end of the spectrum will superficially either embrace this film for all the wrong reasons or condemn it, rather than see it for the statement it makes about the sick state of the media news cycle trap that feeds current society where even the really wicked sometimes, get off scot- free.

But there's one thing i do know, this isn't your normal thriller, its bizarre, ominous and very grotesque at times.Its an orgy of wild images, psychedelic colours and wacky and nauseating camera shots.Now this is where I'm unsure, is this a piece of cinematographic art? or just trash made by a high director?. Its really for you to decide. For example, when they the couple are in a motel room, you can see surreal images outside such as Nazi's marching and wolves howling. Some people may see this as a representation of how disorientated the characters feel or it could be seen as a misled attempt in unique film making. I am really not sure.Don't get me wrong, I love eccentric films such as A clockwork orange and Kill Bill yet i feel that this is going slightly too far. But I've gone through some reviews and its described as 'Brilliant' and as 'a rush'. So its really for you to decide. I tried to be fair with my rating so i rated it in the middle with 5/10 Beauty or Trash? You decide But be ready for a rocky journey of psychedelic cinema5/10",Natural Born Killers
186,maxastree,Worst nineties movie of any decade.,3,6 January 2016,"For starters, I can't stress enough that I liked the idea of divorcing conventions in mainstream cinema. The mantra ""corporate Hollywood sucks"" gains more depth and weight as the years go by, from what I can tell.BUT - I can't stress enough how embarrassingly bad Natural Born Killers is as a story and acting piece. Viewers will be entranced, and more than a little scared by the ultra quick-edit pastiche of different film styles, pop culture references and post production tricks employed in creating this movie, but unfortunately that's all the film really has to offer - an advancement of wacky and experimental editing and post production tricks.While the films style supports a basic theme - that we live in the midst of over saturated, dehumanizing media narratives, the actual story to support this idea kinda sucks. What (appears to) happen in the main part of the story is this: a couple of underclass crazies go on a crime and killing spree, attracting the attention of the mainstream media.The main actors in the piece are wealthy sitcom actor Woody Harrelson from ""Cheers"" and Juliette Lewis, of the overtly classist Scientology cult, also pursuing a very minor career as a rock singer.Anyway, logic prevails - you have to criticize the work, not the people; if you like/don't like the actors in the film, it doesn't matter much, as director Oliver Stone (believe it or not, Stone was a hot property in the nineties) buries their performances under layers of music video style visual effects, cutting their every statement and emotional response into a fragmented, decentralized point-of-view that is ever changing and thoroughly constructed, rather than organic in any sense.Therein lies the films other problem - its basically a self indulgent mess parading as a ""serious comment"" on society. I can't stress enough how embarrassing Harvey Keitels overwrought acting and peculiarly shot scenes are in the films third act, it seemed as if Stone was literally striving to assassinate his credibility as a decent character actor.The film does have one or two interesting scenes though, in particular a hallucinogenic retelling of an incident where the two killers find a snake in a native American settlement, and a few other shots involving the sudden use of blasting nineties rock music. Basically, this movie is like a bizarre, trying-to-be-edgy music video that goes for an hour and fifty nine minutes, and even then, I'm not sure many songwriters out there would want a music video as thoroughly filled with trick editing overkill as this flick.",Natural Born Killers

It is soon after that though that the viewer realises that this isn't a challenging, experimental new cinema but an extended MTV rock promo which outstays its welcome long before the extended and excrutiatingly boring prison scenes.  There are a few good ideas in the film - nothing too new or too challenging and vaguely reactionary.  Isn't Natural Born Killers the type of media overkill Stone is attacking?

191,bulleetz37235,Natural Born Classic,8,7 October 2005,"I think this is a seriously underrated film. I know that a lot of people would probably say it's a load of non-sensical violence portrayed to make America look bad. Well I think George W. Bush does that anyway. This is simply a film, which some also said influenced rises in crime (yeah stupid isn't it?). I can't believe the controversy surrounding this film, it is a great and pretty intelligent film, with great performances from Woody Harellson, Juliette Lewis, Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Downey Jr. This film is not a load of trash, it is not merely aimed at psychos to give them kicks. It is a sly dig at the media's apparent fascination over violence, and it IS true. You cannot deny that the news shows, for the most part... Bad News... Wars in Iraq, wars in Afghanistan, Serial Killers on the loose, Celebs in steamy affairs, and of course violence is (unfortunately) everywhere. NBK shows this in the only way it can, with sheer severity. Heck, it was probably the MEDIA that heckled this films sly attempts to pose its message. It is a classic for definite, it gives us characters who we can understand. From childhood abuse to inevitable violence, the film even mocks TV and the media by presenting the childhoods as sitcoms, that is what makes this film BRILLIANT. The fact it conveys its subtle message in little unorthodox ways that the average Joe Blogs wouldn't pick up on... and I must admit I had to watch it a few times so I could merely believe my eyes, and then I watched it again to try and see the intentions of the film makers, I think I have pinned them down well enough, and I don't want to spoil this film too much, so I gave you the gist. Serial killers on the rampage, in a seriously underrated classic that offers great messages and controversy... WATCH IT. LOVE IT.

192,dvanhouwelingen,One of the best films of the 1990's!,10,28 September 2000,"NATURAL BORN KILLERS is probably the most misunderstood film ever made. Since its release, Oliver Stone has been sued many times over the content- the claims that it inspired people to kill because of its glamourization of violence. Nothing could be further from the truth. Stone's Natural Born Killers is one of the few movies ever made that commends the glamourization of violence in the media. Stone doesn't just blame the killers for their actions but society as a whole. The violent police (represented by Tom Sizemore's Jack Scagnetti, a sex obessed murderer), the penal system (represented by redneck Warden Tommy Lee Jones) and yes, the media (represented by Wayne Gale, brillantly played by Robert Downey Jr.) The film doesn't stop at just blaming Gale and his TV show ""American Maniacs"", which profiles a different mass murderer every week. After all, if people didn't watch, the show wouldn't be on the air. The film points the finger at our society as a whole- how we all love to see violence on TV. We all have bloodlust, but only a few enact on that lust. The film has been heavily criticized on both sides of the political specter- everyone from Bob Dole to Joe Lieberman has criticized it. Maybe if they took a closer look at the film, they would see what it was really about, and not just the flashy surface. My Grade 10/10",Natural Born Killers
193,cyberknight,The Worst Movie Ever!,1,24 March 2005,"I watched this movie only because a friend said it was the most violent movie he had ever seen (not that I like violent movies, it was just that I love Cinema and watching ""the most anything"" is mandatory). Well, I almost slept in the middle of the movie (the only thing that kept me awoken was my hatred on it, I'm of the opinion that, if you want to throw a movie in the trash, you must watch it from head to tail, so no one can blame on me not watching it all for not liking it).This movie is useless trash (can't even be recycled!) It has no story, just a proposition and a series of not connected scenes (you can put the ""end"" - who could call THAT an ""end""?! - before the title screen that it would make absolutely no difference!) Some people could argue that ""NBK"" is an ""art movie"". Well, surely they have never seen true artwork movies in film festivals (unfortunately, art movies don't reach the commercial screens, mainly the short movies, so those that love Cinema have to go after the good festivals). Art movies have one thing that ""NBK"" does not: experimentation. Art movies are about testing new concepts, new ways of capturing image and audio, new ideas of how to tell a story. ""NBK"" uses long tried methods, like discontinued storytelling (watch Monty Python!!!), mixed media (oh, how innovative, using video recording, nobody thought about that before, duh!), parody (damn, what was that ""I Love Lucy"" or whatever he was trying to parody there?!) and, ohmyholygosh, ""gray slow motion psychological camera""?! Be serious!!!Now, what really annoys me about this movie. You have Tarantino, I hate every work he does, but I have to admit that he has some good ideas. You have Oliver Stone in direction (have I to say anything about his skills?!) You have a good set of actors (maybe not the best, but being ""NBK"" what it is, I'm sure better actors would make it even worse - ah yes, I KNOW that nothing is so bad that cannot become worse!) And when you blend all these things, you get... The worst movie ever made! I had to use earplugs to lower the volume of the nasty soundtrack! Tarantino absolutely has no taste for music, yuck! I really don't understand how could a so promising cast do such an awful work! Yeah, you are right, humans can!My suggestion to those that, for whatever reason, liked this ""movie"" (yes, okay, it does move, but it annoys me to put it together with ""real movies""), go watch some good movies. Try the short movie festivals. Try also the animation movie festivals, they are the best for experimental artwork.But if you are just after unjustified violence, take a plane to Iraq and see the Americans murdering unarmed people on the streets, no fake blood! Or go to a U.S.A. college in some ""small ville"", if you are ""lucky"" you will get some degenerated and sexually frustrated teenager blowing people's heads up (too bad they end up killing themselves, U.S. government could use them in their gory plans to take over the world, good soldiers, that are on it for the killing, not the payment, are hard to find...)",Natural Born Killers

Rodney Dangerfield does a great job as Mallory's bastard of a father.  The way Oliver Stone made it like a sitcom with studio audience laughing in the background was genius. How else could you make incest and abuse funny? The last hour which takes place at the prison, is a fast paced ride.  Tom Sizemore, Tommy Lee Jones, and Robert Downey Jr have great roles.  Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis give great performances and this film should be more recognized, instead of put down for being too violent. 7/10",Natural Born Killers

I think the story and social commentary is very good in this film however.

198,soymilk,An awesome movie...in theory,6,11 July 2005,"I'd been hearing mixed things about 'Natural Born Killers' over the years. Either it was an awe-inspiring, bracing social satire that deftly explores the relationship between real-life violence and the juicy spin put on it by the media, or just about the most amoral, unbearable, mind-numbingly brutal exercise in senseless killing ever applied to film reel. Needless to say, it turned out to be one of those movies that didn't quite live up to either side of its press.On the one hand, Oliver Stone has certainly crafted an extremely well-made and visually arresting piece of film-making  a mind-bending montage of black and white camera work, animation, wildlife photography, freeze frame slow motion and outré imagery that comes lunging straight at you, and has you helplessly dissolving in this ferocious joy ride of a movie. And his eye for media complexion is equally a sharp one, lampooning everything from newscasts to sitcoms, and creating many an unforgettable moment in the process (not to mention landing a devilishly effective cameo for Rodney Dangerfield). Superficially, it all packs quite a nerve-jangling punch. Only when you start rooting around for the real purpose underneath all this sensation is the true extent of its genius called into question. Let's bear in mind that it is, after all, a lavish exploitation of media violence, out to demonstrate how the media exploits, and inadvertently glamorises, violence for the sake of sensationand this, it would seem, is where the line between its admirers and its attackers is usually drawn. Call it a work of pure ironic genius or the most shameless hypocrisy of the 20th Century - either way, Stone approaches it with an exceedingly heavy-hand, and the moral undertones are never developed quite strongly enough to atone for just how disturbing and unpleasant this rampage can become at times (the scene where the young couple of killers on the run hold a teenage hostage gagged and bound in their hotel room, for example, is utterly nightmarish  but while Stone never glamorises these actions exactly, he doesn't really do a great deal to condemn them either).The morals themselves are rather mixed and muddled  the major aim is supposedly to reveal how society is, in some way or other, completely to blame for the crime that imperils it. And yet, Mickey's finest moment, in the context of the movie anyway, comes through proudly declaring that his homicidal impulses are entirely innate and he shouldn't be forced to curb them (is the title intended as ironic or isn't it? Who could tell from how this movie goes...). Above all, it fails to turn either Mickey or Mallory into likable, sympathetic characters we can genuinely root for, and thus blunders head-first in its objective mission to have us side with the serial killers. After all, would that not have proved its very point, that the media, even in the form of this flick we're currently watching, has the power to desensitise us to violence? Instead, Stone launches his attack from the opposite end, by making everyone who opposes Mickey and Mallory into domineering monsters in their own right, and seemingly justifying Mickey's claim that everybody else in the world, with one stereotypical exception, has done something they deserve to die for. The later scenes in particular seem determined to prove that the murderous protagonists are actually fighting a perfectly righteous cause, by heeding their in-built urges and, in the process, turn the film into a self-consuming moral mess, one that's lost track of exactly what it was it originally set out to say. As I said, we do get caught up in the movie, but thanks mainly to the artificial touches  that it is, the visuals and the soundtrack, which are mesmerising, but not enough to veil just how repulsive the endless acts of brutality really are, or keep us from wondering why Stone isn't doing more revile them. By the time the movie starts looking smugly down on us for our part in (or so it assumes) kicking back and enjoying the story, we're far too dazed and worn out to care.In the end, I guess the only whole-hearted way to enjoy 'Natural Born Killers' would be to detach your mind beforehand and leave the entertainment value to wash you over, which, strangely enough, is exactly the viewpoint it's supposed to be countering. It was a wildly ambitious project, and to some degree I admire Stone's headstrongness for undertaking it in the first place. Sadly, the results of his labours is, in this case, a technically impressive misfire and, whatever the disputes that went on between them over this movie, the long and the short of it is that this isn't the most flattering example to feature either Oliver Stone or Quentin Tarantino's (two otherwise fine screenwriters/directors) name in the credits. Like most rides gone out of control, it's hugely exhilarating, but hugely nauseating too.Grade: B-",Natural Born Killers
199,BlackBalloon,Stupid,1,13 July 2001,"When I first saw this movie upon its theatrical release, I was seventeen, mad at the world.  I had a blast.  I knew other kids my age liked it for the same reason I did, so I wasn't surprised when I heard two idiots were blaming the film for their crimes.  It's been a while since I last watched the film, but I can tell you in retrospect I don't think I would like it as much as I used to.  I don't even care to see the director's cut.  The image of the severed head on the back of the box turned my stomach.  This is the sort of thing I welcome from a stupid horror movie, not from mainstream Hollywood and a movie that, yes, hypocritically purports to convey some sort of ""message"".  If someone has to sit through this dreck to get it in their head (assuming they didn't know it already through osmosis) that, yes, the media is corrupt and glorifies violence, then they are probably better off living in ignorance.  This is like making a film with the ""message"" that eating results in excrement.  We all know we live in world that is often corrupt and ugly.  This film would not be HALF as hard to take if it were simply a violent, fun, exploitation-type movie, as it would seem Tarantino originally intended.  I know I would think of it more favorably now.  This movie was just complete overkill in so many areas, that it is genuinely stupid.",Natural Born Killers
200,AdFin,"Although Stone fudges the Issue, it's still a very relevant one",7,23 February 2002,"As I pointed out in my comments for the highly overrated Man Bites Dog, the idea of a motion picture attacking the media for sensationalising violence is not only morally questionable, but also a harsh contradiction.  Films are also a form of media product, and the thought of a film-maker allowed free reign to depict violence as explicitly as he/she wants in the name of satire seems like a misjudgement on the part of that particular film maker, just how far can they go before their attack on exploitative violence becomes exploitative violence in its self.  And that is one of the issues with Natural Born Killers.  The idea of Natural Born Killers, or at least the idea that Oliver Stone brought to the table when he took over the project, is the public's fascination with fame, and just how far would someone go to get their fifteen minutes.  Although Stone's visual style contradicts his own ideas, filming the proceedings with an almost comic depiction of violence (bullet point of views and sitcom formatted incest are all scored to cheesy Tom & Jerry style music) his message and intent seems much more (self) important.  We've seen a barrage of reality TV shows and so-called docu-soaps of late (and I keep coming back to this), focusing on a whole host of boring individuals clowning in front of the camera believing they are saying something so important that we (the audience) should be hanging on their every word.But that's the problem, shows like Big Brother, Temptation Island, and in the UK shows like Reps and Pop Idol promote the message that everyone, no matter how un-talented and boring should be given the chance to go out into every living room in the nation.  They also show just how willing the public are to humiliate themselves on these programmes, Pop Idol for instance showed us some of the most desperate bunch of losers ever seen, people where actually turned away on the grounds that they were too ugly, and they accepted that.  And then we have a show like Reps, which follows a group of club reps at a holiday resort aboard.  The stars of the show are a bunch of common losers, who spew foulmouthed obscenities amongst a hail of vomit and alcohol, not to mention every single young person exposing themselves to the camera.  Now I may sound like I'm over-reacting, but this sort of thing only promotes not only a negative review of that person, but also the decline of television entertainment and as some would say, the decline of civilization (ok, that one does go a little far).That's the issue at hand with Natural Born Killers, that people buy this kind of garbage, that people are actually interested in the lives of a bunch of drop-outs, who, although a sad fact, will never do any thing of use with their lives again, ever.  And that is what culminates at the climax of Natural Born Killers, as the audience sits mortified by the idea of a televised riot in which respected news journalists get involved with the killing.  Like I said, Stone doesn't do the greatest job of promoting this issue, because as I also pointed out, the entire notion of film condemning television is a pot/kettle scenario, they two go hand in hand.  But thank god for a film maker who is not afraid to kick-up a storm.  Stone doesn't give the audience any easy answers, nor does he make the viewing experience all that relaxing.  Black & white footage is crosscut with colour, video spliced with film, 16mm with 35mm, animation and digital effects, each, not only signify a change over in the character mentality, but also a strange channel surfing feeling, never allowing the viewer to settle in one place.  
I think I've already used up far too much room, on what would appear to be another useless diatribe as I try to summaries this challenging piece of work.  Although not entirely successful, and it does raise far to many moral issues that it can handle, Natural Born Killers is still a fresh and daring film, that should be seen in it's Director's cut format, for the interested only.  7/10",Natural Born Killers
201,mcgrew,Stone + Tarantino = Zero Value,1,4 April 2004,"I haven't liked any of Oliver Stone's (or Quentin Tarantino's) movies, so here's another one.  Where - for instance - ""Pulp Fiction""  or ""Wall Street"" had one of the three ingredients that a good movie requires  -- plot, dialogue, characters -- this movie positively glories in the fact that it has none.  Billed (eventually) as a parody of media coverage of violent crimes, this apparently endless shoot-em-up traces the lives of two low-lifes whose only talent is killing people.  Alas, this story as already been made, and very well, too: Bonnie and Clyde.  To try and differentiate his ""opus"" from B and C, Stone kills many more people, in scenes paced so badly one can only use the fast-forward to move it along (woe unto those who had this inflicted upon them in a theater), fills it with characters who are too stupid to live (fortunately, most don't), and not-even-cardboard-deep, uses a plot apparently written with, shall we say, chemical assistance, and tries for an MTV and/or NYPD Blue and/or Nissan-commercial look, which didn't help at all.  The opposition is so stupid, so cowardly, and so loud (could Tommy Lee Jones shout any louder?) that the audience, in my view, is completely cheated -- sound and fury, signifying nothing but some extra bucks in Oliver Stone's pocket. (Of course since it was made by Oliver Stone - who has yet to make a movie that wasn't horrid - it was hailed as social commentary.)  See a John Carpenter movie instead, ok?

203,eddie052010,The worst film ever made.,1,29 January 2015,"For some it's Battlefield Earth. For others, it's Showgirls. For others it's Plan 9 From Outer Space. Whatever the case, there are many candidates for the worst movie ever made, but there can never be a definite answer to this question, due to how despite whatever the collective consensus may say about the film, there is always an opposing view. Sure there maybe many titles up for this dubious honour,but never one that all can agree on, except for what our own personal opinions may determine about the film as a whole. It is also why I feel that Natural Born Killers, despite its strong cult following and acclaim is to me the worst film ever made, and one everyone should avoid at all costs.The first major problem is the story. The plot is that a married couple, Mickey and Malorie Knox are on a murder spree, essentially killing everyone they meet. Meanwhile, the media reports on their actions, which potentially might be the bigger bad guys, glamorizing their rampage and giving them a lot of fans in the process. While it may sound very complex first, the plot is almost non-existent, as it consists of one murder to the next with little context to connect the scenes together and occasionally as clip about the media, just to trick you into thinking the film has more substance than it actually does. The only time any story comes into play is during the prison climax, but by then, it's too little too late. The non-linear storytelling also doesn't help, as it makes things needlessly complicated, and helps to make the film have less sense than it already did.The film also has a very bizarre, MTV-esque style, that may be unique and is used brilliantly here and there (mainly in a pharmacy shootout shot in green), but often makes it feel like you're on a very bad acid trip, and it gets very annoying, very quickly. It doesn't help that while the film shows off many stylistic choices (black and white cinematography, comic book sections, a sitcom homage), most don't work and feel random, making the film feel even more messy and poorly put together than it did previously. The dialogue also suffers because of this, consisting mainly of Tarantino-esque dripple that would even make E. L. James or Frank Miller feel dirty due to its pretentiousness. It doesn't help that the film has an absolutely woeful script, one that is so awful that you feel that the style is only there in order to mask many of the script's failings. The first problem is that NONE of the characters are likable. The main couple are a bunch of serial killers who despite their childhood abuse backstory aren't interesting, considering that they kill innocent people for pleasure. The supporting cast are equally as unsympathetic, whether it be Robert Downey Jr's reporter (who adopts an odd Austrilian accent to create an utterly irritating character) or the cop characters in the film, who either act in a sleazy or sadistic manner, and even the usually reliable Tommy Lee Jones acts like a Saturday morning cartoon villain in his role as police chief. The worst thing about the film is that it is a morally bankrupt venture, that has many poisonous messages laying under its skin. Not only does the film expect you to sympathize with a bunch of serial killers, but also makes that lifestyle seem inviting to many, due to how the killing gives the characters pleasure, they gain a strong fanbase and that they will be minimal consequences for your actions, especially considering that they are eventually freed from death row during a prison riot. It also doesn't help that all of the cops in the film are morally corrupt, as they are either perverts, sadists or want to cover things up, and killing them is a good thing (something highlighted when Downey's character says that he feels alive after killing one). These are alarming messages to be sending out, and while I'm often against the idea that fiction inspires real-life crime, this is sadly a case where the naysayers may actually have a point. Sure some may argue that the film is a satire of media glamorizing violence, but the movie is quite hypocritical here as well, as it is itself glamorizes the violence in the film and expects us to care for and worship the main characters, in the same way their fans do. It also doesn't have any sort of counterpoint to this either something which other controversial art (i.e. Fight Club, Manhunt, a lot of rap music) has. Because of this, it isn't surprising that the film has been linked to many real life crimes and tragedies, providing even more evidence to the film's questionable ideology.It is due to these attributes that I consider Natural Born Killers to be the worst movie ever made and one which has no redeeming value whatsoever. Whether it be the non-existent plot line, OTT style, unlikable characters, awful dialogue, hypocritical attempts at satire, dreadful acting and godawful politics that can corrupt many who see it, Natural Born Killers is a true stinker of a film that should be left to rot in the deepest, darkest hole you can find. I understand that back in the 90's, this may have seemed rebellious and exciting to the Generation X crowd, but considering that we aren't in the 90's anymore that we'd grow out of this and reevaluate this for being the absolute stinker that it is. Sadly, since it still has a strong fanbase, I can only assume that many believe that this is a brilliant movie that everyone should see. It isn't. Don't watch this evil movie, as not only is it a bad film, but the worst ever made and a truly reprehensible one at that. Truly shameful.",Natural Born Killers

205,talarisw,"Oliver stone's surreal look at 1990's America and the media's obsession with Micky & Mallory, lovers who go on a cross-country mass murder spree.",10,2 May 2013,"I haven't seen all of Oliver Stone's movies but I'm a fan of his and this has to be one of his best movies. Quentin Tarantino one of my favorite directors, wrote the screenplay and this was before Tarantino became a famous director in which he probably would'eve directed this himself. But supposedly the final film had little resemblance to Tarantino's original story and he wasn't happy with it but the story still feels very Tarantino to me. Since Bonnie & Clyde and the 1967 movie about them their have been a lot of people in real life and in fiction who try to imitate the whole lovers on a crime spree thing but no one done it ""better"" then Micky and Mallory Knox. But what makes this movie great is that it's about a lot more then just lovers on a crime spree, it's a witty, satirical look at our violent culture in 1990's America. The film has a lot going for it, a great story, great characters, great performances, a great visual style, great music, humor and social commentary. This movie should of been nominated for an Oscar, for this film effects you on a deeper level as Stone gives us a truthful look about how violent American culture has gotten through a warped and surreal point of view. I absolutely love Stone's direction here. I love the surreal look of the film, this film is a masterpiece of surrealism. Other directors tried what Stone did but never did it as good as him. I love the slanted camera angels, the switching from black and white to color, the channel surfing, the bizarre cut-aways, the random pieces of animation and the psychedelic backgrounds are all perfectly done. The surreal visuals never become overwhelming or distract from the story or characters. It's like an acid trip and perfectly creates the world of psychopathic lovers Micky & Mallory. I love the different type of music used here. The film's endlessly imaginative, visually creative and the surreality appropriately makes the film that much more intense or disturbing to watch. Some might disagree with Stone's viewpoints like how he blames the media for turning murders into celebrities but there is some truth there, just look at Casey Anthony or Jodie Aries. But the best thing about this movie is the story of Micky&Mallory. M&M are two of the greatest movie villains ever along side other fictitious killers like Hannible Lector or Norman Bates. Woody Harleson is perfect as the cool and calm but ruthless Micky and Juliet Lewis was born to play the more unstable and erratic Mallory. My favorite scene is the opening where everything seems all safe and peaceful with M&M at a small diner along side the highway, Malory does a sexy dance while listening to music but a drunk guy comes on to her and soon all hell break lose. Mallory begins to beat the guy to death and soon Micky joins in killing everyone else. They leave one person alive to ""tell the tale"" and the two then celebrate with a ballroom dance. Harlson & Lewis are all too believable in their roles as heartless killers. I love the flashback showing how they met and Mallory's horrific upbringing. It's a perfect satire that's shown as a 1950's TV show called ""I love Mallory"" with bright colors and a laugh track. Legendary comic Rodney Dangerfeild gives one of his best on screen performance as Malory's horrible father who physically, verbally and worst of all sexually abused her. And it's disturbing hearing the laugh track while Rodney molests his daughter. They don't exactly say how far the sexual abuse went as in did he have sex with her but Micky came to the rescue and together they killed her dad and her mom(for looking the other way). But unfortunately it didn't end there as the two got married and went on a road trip that ended in brutal mass murders wherever they go, ultimately killing 50 people in just 3 weeks. Unfortunley they never went in detail about Micky's upbringing but gave the impression that his father was abusive towards him and his mother and that his mom verbally abused him. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Wayne Gale a spoof on Geraldo Rivera. Downey is brilliantly over the top as a self centered news reporter glorifying M&M for his own gain. Tommy Lee Jones is also brilliantly over the top as a sleazy prison Warden. Tom Seizmore was great as the not too honest cop trying to capture M&M. All these characters are great but there's no one who's not morally bankrupt here, there's no real good guy. Micky's interview with Gale was a great scene where he expresses his unapologetic belief in murder, which led to the prison riots but it was creepy seeing black and white images of 1950's like families watching the horrific events on TV. At it's core this is a great romance, us against the world but the movie does make perfect satire on how people idolize them even though their mass murders. I like when Mallory does a sexy thing with her tongue during a deleted scene. The ending however seem unsettling as M&M get away, not killed but in the credits we see a glimpse of them having a family, happily ever after. I understand that some people felt that Stone treated M & M too much like anti-heroes then villains but I also understand that Stone wanted to go against our expectations and the evil killers live happily ever after. But a deleted scene gave a more satisfying ending where Owen, a prison inmate who helped them escape rides with them but unexpectedly kills them, which is perfect. M&M are not killed by the cops but by another psycho, a prisoner like them who most likely was in for murder. I wish he would'eve used that ending. But one of my favorite movies of all-time, a classic!",Natural Born Killers
206,toonyjakes,"A completely twisted, chaotic work of art.",10,6 May 2020,"Modern day cinema takes little to no risk these days, in favor of being politically correct. Natural Born Killers is a full-fledged, in your face anthem about the glorification of violence in American history.Plot- Mickey and Mallorie leave their life behind after murdering their parents and embark upon an aimless rampage, gathering extreme media attention. It's about the very raw nature of serial killers, and how the media virtually feeds off of tradgedy for a story. It's a wild ride.Characters/Acting- The main characters are obviously awful human beings, but they have enough humanity to observe and admire, much like watching a gangster flick. All of the acting is outstanding for how frantic and sometimes grimly comical this movie can be.Writing- The writing is solid, but I would have liked to feel more of Tarantino's spice, for the final script ommitted most of his content aside story.Quality- This film was shot in 18 different formats. I'd say it's so perfectly edited, animated, and shot for the tone, that I'd recommend psychopathic people don't watch it. It truly gives you the frantic feeling of madness, while also being in a psychadellic trip.Overall I can see why this film caused an uproar and how it triggers some violent people out there, but for someone who loves cinema and seeing something unabashedly bold, this movie is worthwhile. Just don't watch it on drugs or alcohol, you'll spin out.",Natural Born Killers
207,ctrout,Controversial and Misunderstood,7,4 December 2005,"Natural Born Killers is the story of two young lovers (Harrelson & Lewis) who are just having a good time. The only problem is the way they get that good time. It's by killing people whenever they want and whenever they feel like it. Of course, this is a horrible thing to do and it's too sadistic to even think about. So we must stop them by any means necessary. As the story goes on, we realize that the people that are trying to stop them are just as equally insane in their own way as the two main characters.A premise like this could only come from one man and that is Quentin Tarantino. However, the movie version of his story is nothing like the idea that he came up with and that's why his name doesn't come to mind when we think of this. The name that does is Oliver Stone. Stone has done many things that were controversial when they were released and he's influenced many young filmmakers to push the envelope just enough as to say that this is original. When this particular film came out, we thought he'd gone too far.And yet, you don't here much about this movie today. It's over a decade old now and it's had enough time to sink in with the public. When I finally got around to seeing this film, it didn't seem nearly as violent and corruptive as people made it out to be. But I didn't see it when it first came out. No, I saw it only about a year ago. There were many things going through my head about why a film like this isn't as contentious as it once was. I've come to realize and remember that back in 1994, a mostly pre-Tarantino world, our lives weren't as defiled by the media as they are today.This made me come to the conclusion that the film, which actually provided a strong message about who we think are normal people and who we trust, came out at exactly the right time. It was just crazy and original enough to cause an uproar of controversy. If this film were to come out today, it wouldn't be a big deal at all and maybe that message would make its way across a little more clearly.The film itself is just an okay one though. The acting is all right and it does have a good cast that works well together. It's interesting, with minor confusion. The tiny flaws that are in the film keep it as an average one for me and not as a great one like it could have been if Mr. Tarantino could have kept his hands on it. Overall, it's a good film that makes you think and I liked it.",Natural Born Killers
208,blackberrybabe,Naturally Scared Stiff,3,9 July 2004,"I did not care for this movie. It was WAY too violent. I know that was the point, but that didn't make me like it any more. It is definitely an eye-opener on how criminals are perceived by the media. The best in this movie was Robert Downey, Jr. He is wonderful in everything he does, and this was no exception. He plays Wayne, a reporter fascinated by Mickey and Mallory. He tracks their killing sprees and meets up w/them for the final prison battle. Throughout the film, I was on pins and needles wondering what was going to happen to him. By the end, I was crying. This is a movie for people to see if they have a strong stomach, or if they are Downey fans. They will appreciate his talent, and maybe have a better understanding of how the media makes stars out of murderers.",Natural Born Killers

Many have said that it doesn't work as satire; I don't agree.  Look at your own TV, at documentaries, news shows, Springer and so on.  Personally, I don't find _Natural Born Killers_ to be much of a stretch from mass media as it already exists.As far as the editing and use of stock footage and various film formats goes, I believe it goes deeper than mere eye candy.  More often than not, these contrasts hint at deeper themes, and it's not the fault of the film if these themes are at times out of the grasp of the individual viewer.One of my all time favourites.

Jack Scagnetti,played superbly by Tom Sizemore(Harley Davidson And The Marlboro Man,True Romance,and The Relic)is hot on their tail,he is obsessed with capturing Mickey and Mallory Knox.Scagnetti is even as wacko as they are,he kills a hooker in a hotel room.Mickey and Mallory has to stop to get gas,they end up and an Indian's home,he invites them in and gives them something to eat.The Indian and his grandson can see they are sick.The grandfather tries to help them,but Mickey has a bad dream and kills the grandfather,they end up leaving and both get bit by some rattlesnakes.Mickey and Mallory end up at the drug store to get some ""Snake Juice""a.k.a. anti snake venom.The clerk recognizes Mickey from the TV he is watching and sets the silent alarm,he is killed by Mickey.

212,Unicorn-9,I love this movie...,10,9 September 1999,"You know, for years I put off seeing Natural Born Killers because I'd heard so many bad reviews, then last year I finally saw the Director's Cut and was stunned. What an amazing piece of film-making, not to mention social commentary, even though Stone goes over the top here and there and the middle gets confused and pointless in places (particularly the Corvette scene).Then a few days ago I saw the censored (release) version. Now I understand one reason why so many people hate it; that version has been cut up worse than the victim in a low-budget slasher movie. It's hideously trashed, and the censors turned a movie which rants against the glamorization of violence into a movie which glamorizes violence.Now I'm not generally a fan of violent movies for the sake of violence; I rate Tarantino's best at 2 or 3/10 and I still think the worst parts of Natural Born Killers are those where much of Tarantino's original script was left in. But in this case there's a reason for the violence; in order to show how much the media glamorizes and encourages violent behaviour, Stone *has* to show us the contrast between what Micky and Mallory actually do and the dire TV shows which turn their killings into entertainment. We have to see how sick they really are, and how the media turn them into fun-loving celebrities who just happen to kill people.All in all, it's a great commentary on the soulless fight for ratings in the media, the hypocrisy of cops, the idiocy of media-sponsored fandom, and the hidden undercurrent of rage in modern society which is just waiting to spill out into the streets. One of my favorite movies of all time.Oh, but watch the Director's Cut; don't even think about wasting your time on the censored version.",Natural Born Killers

I certainly won't be wasting any more of my time on anything he's involved in in any way! One final thing I will say... in this film Stone himself commits the primary sin of which serial killers themselves are guilty - he completely denies the humanity of everybody involved except himself... this isn't about human beings at all... it's only about Oliver's ego - and a very nasty piece of work it is too.",Natural Born Killers

Fortunately, bits and pieces of his original work still shine through the crap that is this movie--a few lines of dialogue, sometimes a scene is very nice. Unfortunately, Stone's dramatic weird ""jumping around"" (for lack of a better description) is very strong all through this movie.  More so than in any other Stone movie.

Repeat this brutishly simplistic message about 500 times VERY LOUDLY, and you have the movie.There are inklings of cinematographic talent, probably creditable to Oliver Stone, and traces of interest that appear to have survived from Quentin Tarantino's script, but they are overwhelmed by heavy-handed Stoneoid preaching and farcical acting. Just about any criticized element of this film could be attributed to an experimental approach to film, but this laboratory has exploded and a terrible odor is coming from the ruins.

218,Shecky J. O'Pootertoot,"MTV media monsters, courtesy of Oliver Stone",10,12 July 2000,"Natural Born Killers is pure chaos captured on film. My head was spinning after seeing this film for the first time. For some reason I knew in the first minute of the movie that I was witnessing something great. But at the same time, after repeated viewing i'm still not sure what this movie is. Boiled down, it's a finger pointed angerily at the media for being such hypocrites. It's darkly comic. It's intensely violent. It's a music video. It's pretentious. It might also be brilliant.I've heard 18 types of film were used in the making of this movie. I've heard there were roughly 3000 takes that made in into the movie. This is most definitely a visual masterpiece. I think Stone first started using this style of filmmaking in JFK, and has adopted in movies where you would not think it belonged (Nixon), but dammed if he doesn't pull it off every time.The cast, Harrelson and Lewis are both amazing. Robert Downey Jr. is hysterical as the Geraldo-esque reporter. Tommy Lee Jones is great in a comedic roll as a redneck prison warden. And give a hand for Tom Sizemore, always great to have him, though always in a supporting roll, darn it all. I wonder who was higher on set, Downey or Stone? This must have been a wild set to work on. I'll bet the stories are legendary, but for most i'm sure it's all a haze.Oliver Stone is a smart man, some would call him a genius, but I wonder how he would respond to the claim that he points blame at the media, television, print, movies, but never at himself. What is his roll in all of this? Is he just a commentator on the times, is his film a reflection of the times, or does he too deserve some of the blame? Think about this - there have been more copycat murders inspired by Natural Born Killers than the two Littleton, Colorodo high school mass murderers, and those boys recieved exactly the type of overexposure from the media that Stone seems to comment on. What does it all mean? I don't know, but I think Stone over estimates the intelligence of his audience. Many of those that he would like to see the movie and ponder its message will be put off by the rapid editing and hyper violence of the film. However, teenagers will love its MTV style sex and violence, with a soundtrack produced by a God to many teens, Trent Reznor. I've heard that it's already the movie of choice to view by teens when high. Are they really getting anything out of this movie? I hope Stone will continue to create such thought provoking films as this and hope his right to create such controversial films is never be taken away, but a part of me wonders if this movie ultimately did more harm than good. I don't know what the answers are, but I do think it goes beyond the media. What a sad world we live in. Even a visionary like Stanley Kubrick made the decision to pull A Clockwork Orange after reports of copycat violence and rape, so what are we to do?This is a great film, controversy aside. a 10/10 stars.

219,nazztrader,More of a social commentary/absurdist comedy than anything else.,7,26 December 2012,"I saw this back in the mid 90s and at the time I remember thinking that it achieved its goal for me, if that goal was to make a person not want to see ultra-violent films any more. Watching it now, 17 or 18 years later, I find it difficult to take seriously. It does seem like everyone involved was in a drug-induced mental fog when it was filmed. And now it also seems like prediction of what the USA would be like if the vast majority of the nation had gone ""Tea Party"" long before the right wing billionaires decided to ally themselves with the ""Mickey and Mallory"" types. So today, it works for me, now and then, as a comedy, but with some sort of a social commentary edge. However, quite a bit of the time it's not easy to watch because so much of it is simply ridiculous.And then there was the recent Newtown massacre of the innocents, along with all the other homicidal rampages of recent years, which forces the viewer to either turn off NBKs or think of it as the equivalent of pointing fingers of blame at the audience, saying to them, ""by watching these kinds of movies (the non-absurd ones especially) you too are to blame, just as the parents of children who go on these rampages are if they give them easy access to assault rifles. On the other hand, people in nations with very low murder rates watch the same films. I'm not sure if I should give this a 7 out of 10, but I did because it is inventive and does have its moments. If it was meant to make Americans reexamine how they view murderers and guns, it clearly failed, except for a few (like myself). To be sure, I still find subjects like psychopathy interesting academically, but not entertaining. Moreover, I also found it more difficult to ""suspend disbelief"" after watching NBKs, so for example, films like ""The Bourne Identity"" were not as entertaining as they used to be for me. Perhaps your reaction to NBKs will say more about where you are in life when you watch it than anything else.

It kept pulling my attention towards it and I would be interested and then repelled and then pulled toward it again.It displays pure and utter depravity. Mind you it never overtly idolizes these values, it simply displays them. It must have been an experiment on the part of Oliver Stone to create a film with minimal plot line and only chaos, psychadelic visions and violence. Harrelson's character defends his actions by saying that they are pure and he is right. This is pure. No realities were allowed to interfere with Stone's vision of pure death.

Whatever statement Oliver Stone was trying to make with this film is lost in this extremely bloody nightmare. Oliver Stone must have been on serious drugs while making this, and Tarantino must have when he wrote the original story. I have lost some respect for both of them after viewing this horrible film.""Natural Born Killers"" is about a girl named Mallory (Juliette Lewis) who is molested by her father (Rodney Dangerfield) and has a strange childhood. She then meets Mickey (Woody Harrelson), who helps her break away from her scary home life by killing her parents. The two psychos then set out on a killing spree across the American desert. Along the way, they encounter an obsessed journalist (Robert Downey JR using an Ozzy accent ), a corrupt cop who wears women's underwear (Tom Sizemore), and a prison warden (Tommy Lee Jones).The point Oliver Stone was trying to make (I think) was that the media glorifies killers and murderers. But the film is told in such a grotesque and strange manner that there is nothing likeable about it. And the fact of the matter is that this film could have been told very well in a toned down manner, but Stone felt the need to glorify the gory deaths and glorify these sick sick people, who are probably the scariest people to ever hit the big screen.I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, but maybe someone out there might like it.

Not a conventional movie by any means. The problem, though largely glossed by tour-de-force acting direction and editing is the movie's fundamental paradox. The script, whether intentionally so, or presumably unintentionally falls prey to all the same things it satirizes. The serial killers are sympathetic characters who are the protagonists. Also the whole robert downey jr. geraldo rivera styled tabloid journalist now seems dated, something I never would've thought would've happened to this movie. This is a film like Triumph of the Will in my opinion - you might not like it, once you think about it a little you probably won't agree with it, but if you appreciate film you should definitely see it and appreciate it. The original ending made a whole lot more sense, too.",Natural Born Killers

I was shocked to find that it had only a 47% on Rotten Tomatoes and reading all the negative reviews on here. This was a good movie, but people consider this to be a very polarizing movie, it's either a love it or hate it movie for most people, but I think this movie deserves a lot more respect than it gets. As far as I'm concerned, this might be Oliver Stone's best film, but then again, I didn't get around to watching JFK or Platoon yet. The film's detractors either say that the movie glorifies violence, that it contradicts it's own message, or that it's visuals are ugly, all of which are erroneous claims. The criticism that the movie is too violent Andy graphic for it's good is not a valid criticism. That's what I'd like to tell these people. I just don't get why A Clockwork Orange was rated so much better than this movie, despite being similar in theme being another social commentary movie that's disturbing and has a anti-violence message. That being said, this movie is very underrated and deserves more attention. Woody Harrelson does such a good job in the leading role, so do Juliet Lewis and Robert Downey Jr. in this movie. Please take my advice if you're reading this and watch this movie. If you do heed my advice, go watch the Director's cut to get the full experience. Just go watch it.",Natural Born Killers

I was a little bit worried going into this considering it was originally written by Tarantino and him not being satisfied with the final outcome. I was wrong. This film is action packed until the very end. The story itself is strong. The film follows a murdering couple crossing the country in one hell of a bloody road trip. The acting is one point, with this being (in my opinion) Woody Harrelson's best performance. Do yourself a favor and check out Natural Born Killers. 9.5/10",Natural Born Killers

The metaphors it shoots for a far overblown, and the attempt to use the two main characters to symbolize the violence in America is disingenuous. All this film did for me was to leave me feeling exhausted and dirty. Only Robert Downey Jr. pulls off director Stone's intent to show the hypocrisy of our society. For those who view the film industry as an art form to reflect the mores of our culture, this movie fails miserably. Ironically, because of this movie's twisted and foul nature, it will most likely be considered a cult classic, which itself is an unfortunate comment on American society.",Natural Born Killers

The only reviewers and journalists that I heard criticising it were ones that work for media that revel in carrying the stories, _and exclusives_, that this film is about. Such hypocrites are shown in a very ugly light. This film is not just about killing, it's about the hypocracy.It's so well acted in the main that you can't help but sympathise even with characters you think are despicable. As an example, look out for the journo's mobile call to his estranged wife towards the end, it should put a smile on your face even though the scene is painted with blood - not the most smile-inducing environs.Has lots of turns of phrase that are not long enough to really be quotes, and won't be understood out of context. e.g. ""Bad bad bad bad bad"" - it won't mean anything until you've seen the film.

It's so cool and slick you would honestly not believe it was an ""older"" film. It could easily be pulled off as something that came out last year. It has stood the test of time better than many other films ever do.The story is what makes this film great. It's outstanding it's so interesting and often sick?! and at the same time twisted. It's not a film of beauty in anyway it's ugly and twisted but that is what it does so well you can't help but fall in love with the film and the characters involved.The story is pulled off that well that i actually thought it was based on a true story until i found later it wasn't. Stupid me but it is pulled off and written so well i guess it shows.With phenomenal performances from Woody and Juliette. I don't think i've ever seen characters come to life on screen like i did in this.It's not Juliette and Woody your seeing it's Mickey and Mallory! It's a great film that i think anyone with a good taste for films will love.Also look out for great character acting from both Tommy Lee Jones & Robert Downey JR (Playing a Australian documentary interviewer).And come on 7/10? what the hell is going on there.

233,mrda1981,Nuggets of genius amidst a meandering narrative.,6,27 April 2012,"A hyperstylized, visually jarring, at times disorientating story about serial killers and the vulture culture that arises around them. Some parts work, like Mallory's abusive home life being filtered through the medium of sitcom; other moments seem unsure of themselves, as if Stone can't decide whether he wants to be serious or satirical. As a result, the film can come across as a series of random sequences piecemealed together. Good thing all the meandering gets a top-notch soundtrack!Still, I think the character of Wayne Gale an amusing and potent creation, acting as the embodiment of the collective's fascination with predatory killers. His line-blurring between spectator and perpetrator hint at some kind of vicarious yearning waiting to be tapped within those who celebritize the serial killer. Stone's way of implicating and indicting his audience, perhaps? (Also, this is the second film I've watched this week featuring O-Lan Jones as a diner girl: what's with that?)",Natural Born Killers

Afterall, at that point in time it was ""cool"" to ride the Tarentino bandwagon, however one can only wonder just how good the film actually could have been had it been directed by Quentin. The version in question of course was directed (sadly) by Oliver Stone and love him or hate him, he always TRIES to be provocative... even if he comes across as juvenile and foolish. Like I said though the film was quite an experience, problem was though that was the FIRST time. I remember running around and raving for days about it, so naturally I had to go and see it again. What I got the second time was far from the film I got off on, it was instead like a massive MTV commercial. Dont get me wrong, the movie was fine in some senses, but once you stripped away all the glam and glitz it fell incredibly flat (even  moreso if you see the extended version, it really tries ones patience visually since it seems that the whole film is static shock images for 12 year olds). The violence in the film was really its only saving grace, but you know even with it having so much excess violence (always a plus in my book) it STILL fails miserably as a film due to the weak cast and in some cases (Woody) horrid performances. The film brings to mind another Tarentino written vehicle, TRUE ROMANCE, but unlike that film (which FELT like a Tarentino movie)it has no staying power. Romance was masterfully directed by Tony Scott and had a tour de force cast, and even after 9 years it grows on me even more every time I see it, but thats not the case here, as the film actually made me ill the last time I watched it due to the stale and typical performances.

Its got so many sick sad yet real meanings in it displayed through stylish visuals, like the use of the 50's family watching TV for the first time in a little happy world, but wait their watching murderers doing what murderers do, ironic and also very true. People watch anything, enjoy suffering of others, and the media loves to show it to us. This movie is about many things, some hard to describe, others, so obvious it hurts. You should see it for yourself just to get a little, i mean huge, eye opening. Its definitely one of the most thought provoking films ever, its truly an experience that is so easily understood yet still confusing. Like i said its hard to explain, and it means a lot, so to define the whole movie would be impossible so i guess it requires many views, but its hard to sit through because it you know whats its about, you just cant figure it out, its like a puzzle where the pieces don't fit, on purpose, so you'll spend the rest of your life thinking about everything Stone was trying to say with it. It does have flaws, but it is also brilliant, i thought it had a bit too much smut (smut as no place in movies, it just harms them, it can add to the feel of the movie, maybe thats why there's so much, but i don't really need to watch other people doing it, sex is a private matter that 2 people in love should share, not an amusement), the violence is not overly graphic, but its more of a pshycological matter, there's isn't very much blood when compared to Saving Private Ryan, but then again American History X wasn't that violent either in terms of graphic, but more of a shock event. Oliver Stone is the third best director ever, behind Ridley Scott and Spielberg, he as proved that with Alexander, JFK, Platoon, Born on the fourth of July, and this, and no director will ever have more balls then him.

238,cinemaofdreams,A Failed Satire With Moments of Brilliance,4,7 November 2009,"OK, it is 15 years after all the controversy has subsided and this film is essentially a footnote in cinematic history. I have never been a fan of Oliver Stone so I usually avoid his films. Ever since the disappointment I felt with Platoon, a film I ranked 7 out of 10, and the over the top, poorly acted TV mini-series Wild Palms I have not taken Stone too seriously. Platoon is a good movie, but I felt it was overly-lauded. But I digress here. Natural Born Killers is not what I really expected. In fact, I have never seen a film in which I have struggled so much as to what I think of it. I did not realize it was as over-the-top, and cartoonish. When people comment on feeling dizzy at hand-held camera shots in films I giggle. The first ten minutes of this film made me understand what they are talking about. This is not a movie. It is an overly extended music video for the MTV generation. I get Stone's point and I don't disagree. There are moments of brilliance in some of the things he does here but there is simply no emotion or element of awe or mystery to keep me compelled. The satire is overwrought. The narrative is too frustrating, and hyper to deconstruct. What I saw was an LSD trip that OD'd on SPEED. I must laud Stone for his nerve, and daring to bring experimental elements into his film. I can appreciate what he was trying here, and cheer the moments that worked. The acting is quite good. No arguments there. Nonetheless, this is a failure as a movie. Perhaps it would have worked if there had been no characterization at all but had been just a series of montages. If those we see were anonymous, and the main characters not portrayed directly but merely background characters celebrated by the masses. Maybe then it would have worked. Something more akin to Kenneth Anger rather than traditional Hollywood fare. The outcome for me is that this is a mediocre film with some greatness coming through now and then. 4 out of 10.",Natural Born Killers

Many of the crimes and activities of the main characters are shown by numerous images through television and news programs, as well as swift cut and paste footage as well as elements of satire and parody. The film starts in a café, but the violence is in the first ten minutes and is purely horrifying. This film is controversial for a reason, and whether this is to be admired or not is still unclear. The acting is great, with Woody Harrlesson giving an impressive performance. The film will leave you feeling sick with the killers very obvious lack of empathy and the brutality of the crimes, but the film goes beyond that, exploring topics such as worshiping people in the news, which paints the leads as Charles Manson- liked and adored by many, but are in fact, are brutal killers. No spoilers here, but the film becomes excellent by Trent Reznor's (lead singer of Nine Inch Nails) soundtrack, the way the film is shot, the uncompromising skills of Oliver Stone and the satire that it plays on culture with the use of it's dark themes.

240,Cloud20,"The turn-point of ""F""-ed up film-making...",8,4 February 2006,"Natural Born Killers (1994) Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Robert Downey Jr., Tommy Lee Jones, Tom Sizemore, Rodney Dangerfield, Arliss Howard, Edie McClurg, Kirk Baltz, Balthazar Getty.Oliver Stone's ""Natural Born Killers"" is one of the hardest films to sit through and review. It definitely makes a case for one of the most talked-about, hyped up, and controversial films of the 1990's. It is a masterpiece of film-making, but I would not necessarily call the film a favorite of mine.The story is about two mass murderers who go on a killing spree across America. It started as a murder out of rage from their pasts, but they are influenced to kill again from the media's coverage for them, and their fame across the nation, and even the world. After killing dozens of people, they are finally caught by Officer Scagnetti (brother of a character mentioned in ""Reservoir Dogs""). In prison, Reporter Wayne Gale offers Mickey to express his feelings on TV and what made and makes him a murderer.Now, the storyline may not sound very interesting, but you have to see it to believe it. When I first saw the film (I saw the Director's Cut first), I didn't like it at all, and thought that the overuse of style and violence totally killed the film. But after watching the theatrical version months after seeing the Special edition, I have different thoughts on the film.One of the main reasons that this film was controversial was because of the violence. In the theatrical version, I had no objection to the use of it. Knowing that I was purposely viewed it and saw the media's coverage of the killers in a sick way, I didn't take it as seriously. In the Director's Cut, there was an overkill of violence that didn't make me find much else.Another reason could be what goes on inside the killer's minds (The demon). When I first saw it, I thought ""What is this???"" to myself. I found it very messed up, bizarre, and the weakest and most horrible part of the movie. But now I understand what everything means. This isn't a motive for serial killers, but what went on inside the minds had to do with the mood that they were in. And that didn't only happen with the killers, but other characters in the film that do crazy things.""Natural Born Killers"" is a scary film. But it isn't scary because of just Mickey and Mallory's actions, but how everyone reacts to them. The rest of the world encourages them to keep on what they are doing. One random teenager being asked about them says ""Not that I believe in all these killing, but if I were a mass murderer, I'd be Mickey and Mallory."" The film is much scarier where you realize that Mickey and Mallory are not only the crazy ones, but everyone else is too in a somewhat corrupt and twisted society. However, the dark comedy is unexpected, but does good with its presence.I can't really say that I recommend the Director's Cut of the film, but some might find it better. The extra bit that is added in is mostly more violence that kind of draws the film away from the message. The deleted scenes aren't good at all, in my opinion. However, we do get to see prison inmate Denis Leary much crazier than everyone else, which was somewhat interesting. The alternate ending may be worth a look.This is arguably Oliver Stone's most daring film. Stone, not new to controversy, gives us probably his most mixed and stylish film to date. ""Platoon"", ""Born on the Fourth of July"", and ""JFK"" being three of my all time favorite films, Stone is one of the best directors of modern cinema.In the end, ""Natural Born Killers"" does come off as a powerful and unforgettable experience in movies that I may never see again. It is bizarre, strange, chaotic, and brilliantly made. It isn't for all tastes, and not for the squeamish. See it at your own risk as this film varies different opinions. 4 out of 5 stars.",Natural Born Killers
241,Libbets,Pure Mayhem (Possible Spoilers),10,14 December 1999,"I found this film to be completely fulfilling. Its funny, violent and satirical of the media driven world we live in. Micky and Mallory meet, get married and go on a killing spree. They are heavily influenced by violent films, such as ""Scarface"" and have had traumatised childhoods (We learn Mallory has been sexually abused by her father and Mickey saw his father commit suicide when he was a child).The images that are used in the film are remarkable, all pure natural images, horses, snakes etc. Oliver Stone directs remarkably the whole film is one long dizzy trip that never lets up. It as visually stunning as it is thought provoking.The media and its power is a predominant figure throughout the film. Mickey and Mallory become cult icons through the media hoopla. In one scene they are shown as getting mobbed by adorning fans as they leave court. During M&M's bloody jail break sleazy journalist Robert Downey jr says ""are we getting this"" referring to the fact that they are broadcasting on live TV.

I was actually stunned to what this film turned out to be. It's a hit against basically everything in our American culture. How we have to have stories to go along with every crime, how it intrigues us to watch gruesome violence on TV and how we act as if death is a big deal even though it happens all the time. It pokes fun at all of us in a scene towards the end when our 'hero', played by Woody Harrelson is being interviewed by a very over- the-top Robert Downey Jr. I would appreciate these messages more if they weren't downplayed and introduced only towards the very end. For this reason, it just felt like a violent drama that felt the need to have some sort of meaning to it all to not be criticized just for the violent nature of itself. What made it stand out to me more was the interesting cinematography and clips of stock footage spliced into the film. It was a less subtle approach to keep our eyes on the screen and our attention, but I appreciated it for its uniqueness, nonetheless. Overall, this film brings itself slightly out of the crowd for having some interesting situations and unique characteristics, and for some over-the-top performances.",Natural Born Killers
243,tangietangerine,"I guess I was born, naturally born, born bad",10,4 August 2014,"I was introduced to this film without much previous knowledge on Oliver Stone's filmmaking. When I watched it for the first time, I had no idea he was known for his controversial themes and points of view. Knowing what I know now, I would say this story written by Quentin Tarantino fits like a glove. This movie reeks of experimental innovations and mind-blowing statements. But I don't think it's simply a contemplative artistic film; it's also a very sarcastic and frantic portrait of the 20th century American society. A society that glorifies violence at the same time that it sets the moral rules as to who deserves to live and who doesn't. Stone couldn't have casted better actors suited to the role than Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis. Their performance is the heart and soul of the movie, seeing their great chemistry together on-screen and ability to convey such intensity to their characters, which at times leads us to think they really might be Mickey & Mallory in real life, or something like it – Robert Downey Jr. and Tommy Lee Jones are great too. The perfect example for Lewis' performance is the scene where McClusky introduces her to Scagnetti: ""you know her, you love her, you cannot f*cking live without herMallory Knox."" And then she comes running blood-eyed and bangs her head straight against the door, a shot that injured both cameramen who attempted to do it. I only wish Juliette appeared on the cover of the movie, it was not only long ago I realized she can be seen on the reflection of Woody Harrelson's glasses. I know that Mickey is the one who gives the philosophic dimension to the discussion proposed by the movie, but Mallory is as important as he is; to me, she is the utter personification of insane raw and sexual power and aggression and the fact that she is a woman just makes it even greater (""How sexy am I now?!""). One of my favorite parts of the movie are the ironic sitcom scenes, which can also be seen as a commentary on our society's sick way to deal with pain and how trivialized it has all become, literally a freak show. I also love the way they interposed all sorts of images, from actual war footages to a cartoon version of Mickey and Mallory, a fascinating representation of the last century's culture and how it is all fed to us through an insane explosion of images, colors and subliminal messages, much like is shown in the movie. Other remarkable moments are Mickey's interview conducted by the hilarious Wayne Gale, where Stone succeeds in proving his point, and the scenes shot inside the prison where chaos rises. I cannot imagine what it must have been like, to have shot inside an actual prison and everything, but it certainly enhanced the performances and the reality of it all.",Natural Born Killers

It's incredible that these two (Mickey and Mallory) were able to commit this much violence...I kept wishing that the damn snakes would just kill them...

As Harry Callahan in the Enforcer would say: ""Very stylish"".I generally avoid Tarantino (involved in the script) and underdog martyrdom. Film as an art form, some would argue, entitles it to experiment with different approaches. The problem is using excess violence to parody violence, as this film does, goes too far. It was difficult to watch in places. It has been linked to Columbine and other such events. Even one death caused by the film, invalidates the approach. It seems not everyone has the mental stability to cope with such an arty film.Finally Robert Downey Jr (I'm a fan), gave a lacklustre performance with an unrecognisable accent.

From the start I was blown away by this movie! It is a full assault on your senses. I was afraid to blink for fear that I'd miss something. I loved this movie because of what it does to the viewer. After the movie my girlfriend said, ""Isn't it sad that we're so jaded that we don't even have any emotional response to this movie!"" I was floored because it was then that I realized that that's exactly what Oliver Storm wanted! In this satirical movie he depicts how blood-thirsty the media is...even more blood-thirsty than Mickey and Mallory! Oliver Stone wove this movie in such a way that the viewers almost cheer for the twisted mass murderers. Supporting roles like Skagnetti (the murderous and sleazy cop/hero), the prison guard (Tommy Lee Jones), and the shallow reporter (Robert Downey Jr.) are shown in such a negative light that the viewer almost hates them and cheers for the natural born killers. At the same time that it shows how demented the media it is it shows how society as a whole may be as mad as Mickey and Mallory Knox! It even makes the viewer wonder why their cheering for the dubious duo and why they aren't disgusted by what they are seeing. This movie is worth the time and buck and half to watch it. Go out and pick up a copy. The visual effects alone will blow you away but it will tantalize your mind and eyes and the same time.",Natural Born Killers
250,Erick-12,Post-script on Hypocrisy,9,10 February 2005,"Natural Born KillersReleased just long enough ago to be forgotten by today's standard of speed amnesia, this film by Oliver Stone is worth seeing again. The violence in it was sickening just a few years ago, but such things have quickly gotten normalized in our culture's ongoing desensitization. Ironically, this very process of media desensitization is precisely the topic of this film's satire. NBK has since even been the subject of copycat crime sprees, or so the culprits claimed. This is troubling, because while the film works hard to analyze the dubious process by which violent killers are turned into romantic heroes in the mass media, NBK seems unable to escape from the same orbit, ending with the killers as living happily ever after, justified by the brutality of their backgrounds, and morally superior to the prison officials and popular journalists who pursue them. But as a postmodernist satire of media saturation-violence, from wrestling to sit-coms to real crime dramatizations to obsessive live news interviews, Stone's film is a thought provoking exercise that is stylistically mesmerizing.As a postscript, several people accused Stone of inciting copycat crimes and called for him to be sued for damages-- which happened. The lawsuit was dismissed. At the least he was negligent, they argued. Interesting to me that the glorification of violence found everywhere in the thriller genre is taken to be safely neutral, while a powerful satire of glorification is condemned as, well, too violent. The last time I checked, this was always defined as ""hypocrisy"". The major contradiction in media culture now is that on the one hand, Natural Born Killers is reviled for inciting violence, while on the other hand, it is reviled for being _too obviously_ critical of media violence in a simplistic and unsubtle manner. But can we have it both ways? No.A 2nd postscript on another form of hypocrisy: Quentin Tarantino, the reigning postmodernist ""King of Cool"" who plays with pastiche of pop culture genres, wrote the script for Stone's Natural Born Killers, but then criticized the way the film was directed. Ironically, Tarantino then copied several formal film techniques and innovations straight out of NBK for his later ""Kill Bill"" films. -- with the key exception that Tarantino continues the tradition of glamorizing violence. The Tarantino crowd sees itself as properly aesthetic and cool, far above the ham-fisted Stone! Creepy isn't it?",Natural Born Killers

252,Loothor,"An almost-wonderful, ultimately overdone, film.",7,19 February 1999,"The thing about Oliver Stone is, he doesn't seem to know when to stop. ""Natural Born Killers"" is a movie with a timely message, a strong script, a very gifted cast, and some really remarkable moments, but ultimately it undermines itself by using so many intense visual effects and such bizarre camera work that the film-making itself becomes more attention-absorbing than all other elements of the film combined.This is not to say that the frenetic visual style is inappropriate, just over-used.  In some scenes, the camera work is incredibly appropriate and indeed, it could be said that because this film is about media, you should be forced to examine the media of this film itself.  This is undoubtedly true, but Stone simply loses sight of any other aspects of the film, and in his heavy-handed fashion, satisfies his need to make an ""art"" film and draw attention to himself as director rather than what could have been a truly great film.That said, this is still a film well worth seeing.  The casting of Rodney Dangerfield is inspired, and he gives what is certainly the greatest performance of his life in a role that is unlike anything else he's ever done.  The script is intelligent and displays the Quentin Tarantino talent of ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Reservoir Dogs"", and ""Jackie Brown"".So watch ""Natural Born Killers"" and enjoy, but just remember to bring your barf bag, and give a big ""what if..."" for how great this movie might have been if Tarantino had directed it himself.",Natural Born Killers
253,jdowling,Much deeper than the killing & violence on the surface,7,13 August 2006,"This is not the kind of movie I usually like to see. I hate violence and gore and don't see a purpose to horror movies that just seem to be about how they can scare you. My daughter got me to watch this movie when she was a teenager, because it was her favorite and I wanted to understand her better by understanding what she likes.I don't think my teenage daughter got the same thing out of this movie that I did. I think she focused on the emotional rebellion and how the actions of the main characters related in her life in a world that appears to be hypocritical where she didn't seem to fit. I was able to connect to that theme, though, in seeing the message about how the media, politicians, the audience (users of the media), and others act similarly to killers - without morality. How different are the journalists who report on it and the politicians who exploit it for their own purposes? How different are the people who obsess with hearing about news that exploits these people? If you watch the movie with the idea of how violence plays out in our society, you will get something out of it that can be constructive. If you love violence and want to emulate the characters, which few people in our society are actually naive enough to do, you need to note that this is a fantasy and written to make a point, not to realize someone's perversion.",Natural Born Killers

Not by a long-shot---as guilty as our 'Big-Pharma'? Nope. Our 'cig-industry'? Nope. The potential mass-extinction, of humanity, via the Green-House? Nope. Small change, simply portraying 'victims' of a dangerous-laden criminal society---that is the core of this work. Bravo! Now some of you don't 'get-it'--2,000,000 wasted Phillipinoes, before and after they helped stop the Japanese invaders? 3,000,000 Indo-Chinese, after violating The Geneva Convention's lawful ruling--Nixon destabilizing Cambodia, leading to Pol Pot's 'killing-fields?

Sad, but true--Zhukov would have torn the other allies apart. That is why we waited for invasion, 'till Normandy--not to save Europe from Hitler, Russians did that, but to get men there to counter them--'the bomb' settled that deal---a nation of 'Natural Born Killers'---don't blame Mickey & Malloray--simply a product of a murderous history---did the Canadians need a Revolution?

255,bibleboyiam,-10/10,1,24 July 2003,"I had originally heard of Natural Born Killers on a tabloid show when it instantly caught my attention. They described it as one of the most controversial films of all time. Once hearing this I just HAD to rent it to see what the hype was all about. To this day I wish I hadn't made that mistake. This movie was a ridiculous attempt at controversy and acclaim. Oliver Stone's methods of throwing extreme gratuitous violence in the face of viewers was utterly shameful and pathetic, and I'm usually not one to complain about pointless violence in movies. In particular, near the ending of the movie when the prison riot ensues and everyone involved decides to take up arms and slaughter one another, I could feel my brain welling up with hatred for every individual involved in the making of this movie. I began to wish that whoever was responsible for releasing such complete sewage into the general public should be crucified and burned simultaneously, namely Oliver Stone himself. This movie accomplished nothing, except to release a wave of nihilistic bullsh*t into the minds of those who were unfortunate enough to be living during the time that it was created. I never thought that I could feel such contempt for a film, but this one opened my mind up to a whole new world of pure disgust. If anyone ever wondered how it feels to be suicidal, then they should watch this movie, afterwards they will be banging their head against the wall in hope of losing all memory of what they had just seen. This movie should be sent straight back to hell where it came from. The worst movie I have ever or will ever see. I give it a negative 10 on the 0-10 scale.btw: although my username may lead one to think it, I am by no means some religious fanatic trying to rid the world of evil.",Natural Born Killers
256,TomiusJ,Overrated and surprising dull.,3,4 February 2005,"NATURAL BORN KILLERS, directed by Oliver Stone has probably earned a space in my vault of movies I consider to be totally overrated and incredibly bad. And believe me, there's not that many. I'd heard this was a great film from some friends, and many reviews I'd read said it was ""Original"", ""Fresh"" or ""Breathtakingly Marvellous"". So, being a lover of film, I bought it. I've never been so let down in my life. Many will say, ""You're not looking into it!"" or, ""It's arty and metaphorical."" I understand that, but that still doesn't make it good. Oliver Stone has done some amazing stuff, like PLATOON or the script for SCARFACE. However, he has truly let himself down with NATURAL BORN KILLERS. It may seems vibrant and colourful, but truly it's duller than a black & white version of THE SIMPSONS.But, as people differ, I may be the only one who doesn't like it. I'll let you decide yourselves, don't take my word for it. Rent it out though, just in case you really do hate it. Oh, and guess what? Quentin Tarantino wrote the story and he doesn't like the movie at all. (3/10)",Natural Born Killers

Yes, the media irresponsibly glorifies violence, but this movie ended up being the worst offender of them all.  Okay, this movie defines the problem, this movie BECOMES the problem, and offers absolutely no suggestion on how to fix the problem, which makes it appear to me that Tauranteno and Stone are just two wise guys sitting on the sidelines taking potshots.

259,mikelepost,Does not hold up,3,16 February 2016,"Watched this movie back in 1994 when it was released (and I was 18 or so) and again just recently when it ran on IFC. At the time of its release I thought NBK was ""meh."" Now with the benefit of 20 years of hindsight I think it's a bit of a disaster.There are several problems with NBK but the biggest issue is that it's a total failure as satire. I get the sense that Oliver Stone intended to satirize the media's infatuation with and exploitation of true crime stories and serial killers. This would be fine if Stone himself didn't completely romanticize and even mythologize Mickey and Mallory, the young killer protagonists of this film.I kept waiting for Stone to contrast the ugliness of their crimes with the spectacular way they are presented by the media. No such luck. Instead, all of their victims are shown to be disgusting human beings who deserve their fate. The highly stylized way the violence is meted out adds to the sense that we're supposed to be rooting for these two murderers and to view them as the victims of the film.In a nutshell, Stone is guilty of the same sensationalism he pretends to condemn in this film. The tone is all wrong and we the audience are never sure whose side we're supposed to be on or why.Aside from this huge creative miscalculation, the movie is wildly overedited and constantly shifting from black and white to color to odd angles etc. This is mostly annoying and didn't add anything to the film. The main story is also totally clichéd and the film doesn't even work on the level of satisfying exploitation, featuring far less violence or sexuality than I expected.Overall just plain bad.",Natural Born Killers
260,crazy-ben66,A cruel butchering of a perfectly good original vision,7,23 December 2010,"In 1990 a young inexperienced Quentin Tarantino set out to make a dent in the movie- business. The year before he had sat and watched in tears as the majority of his debut feature entitled 'My Best-Friend's Birthday' went up in smoke (quite literally, an editing fire). A broken man, Tarantino was destined to learn from his mistakes and so, he set out to make a movie people would talk about. 'Natural Born Killers' was scripted and after a failed attempt to shoot the movie himself (on a lean budget of $500,000), Tarantino gave up and instead opted to make a more realistic first feature, which eventually became the cult-classic 'Reservoir Dogs'. As for his 'Natural Born Killers' script, Tarantino optioned it with a studio and used the cash to help fund his movie. In 1993, Oliver Stone set upon said script with the intention of making a movie which was easier to shoot than his previous effort 'Heaven & Earth'. Stone set to work re-working Tarantino's original script with his two friends and what came out of that exists today as his blood-soaked epiphany 'Natural Born Killers', easily Stone's most controversial work. The final product is a gross, butchered version of the original script (available in most good book-stores as a published book) leaving little resemblance to the intentional crime piece Tarantino had wished it to be. Whereas the original script focused heavily on the character of Wayne Gayle and the media-coverage of the murderous rampage by Mickey and Mallory Knox (in an obvious attempt to liberate Tarantino's feelings towards murder in the media) Stone instead focused on the psychotic duo at the heart of the story. He mixes in text-book filming with film-school style 16mm shots and random nature footage, weaving together an obsessively broken tale. The cuts are so frantic and ridiculously placed, it is difficult to find meaning within them and ends up wounding a possibly brilliant movie. The tale of Mickey and Mallory Knox, two star-crossed lovers hell-bent on the destruction of man-kind is almost justified by Stone with his, at times, sensitive direction. His presentation of the law is hideously twisted, forcing them into the villain's seat and pushing Mickey and Mallory forward as the anti-heroes. He almost justifies their wrong-doing by emphasising Mallory's painful past and writing in lines detailing their obvious dis-regard for the modern world. The performances are mostly, much like the editing style, frantic and un-called for, with the few exceptions being Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis in the two lead roles. Tommy Lee- Jones' possibly superb turn as a prison warden is sliced down by idiotic scripting and painfully O.T.T. direction and Robert Downey JR.'s early role as journalist Wayne Gayle is butchered by a horrifically camp and silly Australian accent. Harrelson is the true star however, sitting atop a mound of ambitious, talentless half-wits all attempting to make their mark, instead overstepping their boundaries and vomiting unidentifiable garbage onto the screen. It is he and only he who presents his psychotic counter-part with the wisdom and thought he deserved, playing him as a calm and reasonably well-mannered psychopath but with enough menace and fear to make the character truly unlikeable. I feel the other performances could have definitely matched up to this, had they been reading from the original script. Overall I believe Oliver Stone's 'Natural Born Killers' is, on its own, a decent re-working of a common crime tale. However, the frantic cuts and pointless exploitation of useless footage does not work and mostly just fractures the possibly-great movie. The film waits a good hour before truly hitting its stride and even then has its moments of unbearable pretentiousness. Personally, I believe Quentin Tarantino's initial script would have worked much better than Stone's and really would have given this gruesomely controversial story of love and death the movie it deserved. Sadly, this is not the case and so we can only look back at would could have been and hope that one day, Tarantino decides to dig out his old scribblings and give it another go. I doubt that will ever happen (he said himself that it is no longer his movie to mess with) but we can live and hope. 7/10",Natural Born Killers
261,Julien-11,Would-be satire,5,12 September 1999,"This film begins as an account of two brutal serial killers who always leave one victim behind to tell the story of the rampage.  But anything Oliver Stone had to say about it is lost with his completely inane  (and insane) filmmaking style.  Scenes shift from cartoon to black-and-white to color to slow-motion to brief cuts of countless television series and old horror movies back and forth, without ever interrupting the dialogue.  Stone's attention to detail this time looks sick, like filming a live scorpion getting run over, or Tommy Lee Jones licking his lips, or a close-up of Robert Downey Jr's hand injury.  The solid satire is not helped by the uncontrolled performance of Jones, Downey Jr, or Juliette Lewis.  Only Woody Harrelson is credible.  But I have to say sometimes Lewis is credible, cause when I see a movie with her, I just think of this perversity.",Natural Born Killers
262,The_Eighth_Passenger,A visual assault on your senses. Bold and brilliant.,9,16 April 2007,"Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers is quite possibly the most controversial film ever made. No other has sparked such a debate of violence in cinema, and has caused such a divide between lovers and haters. Many people see it as a poignant social commentary, a wickedly funny and dark outlook at a society gone mad with the idea of celebrity and media obsession. Others see it as depraved celebration of sick violence, and a catalyst for what it seeks to undermine. The film certainly contains scenes of horrific, deplorable, violence, but I would argue that the over-the-top 'cartoon' violence is done to let the audience know that the film is not meant to be taken too seriously. Yes, the message is serious, but we need a bit of black comedy with our satire, otherwise it's just like watching a very boring fact based documentary. The violence (and the whole film) is completely over the top because that is what Stone is telling us; ""We have gone too far.""Based on a script by Quentin Tarantino, the film follows two young lovers, Mickey and Mallory (Woody Harrelson and Julliette Lewis) as they travel across America killing because it's what they want to do. Hot on their heals is hot-shot cop Jack Scagnetti (Tom Sizemore) who is not quite what you would call an ""honest cop"". Also along for the ride is sensationalist journalist Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr) who hosts (and produces, and directs) the cheesy tabloid show 'American Maniacs'. The first 45 minutes of the film shows us how Mickey and Mallory meet, and shows us their murderous rampage across the country. Like Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, the first act of the film is the most shocking part. Most people who have turned off either film has done it by the end of the first act. The two films share many other things in common; at the end of the first act our antagonistic protagonists are caught and sent to prison, they both have ""graphic violence"" and are hated by politicians and mother's groups, and both have much to say about our society and the mindset of it's outcasts. NBK is very much the A Clockwork Orange of the 90's.Whilst incarcerated Mickey gives an interview to Wayne Gale, and it is here that the film is at its most interesting. He provides a thoughtful, in-depth insight into why he is what he is and does what he does, and the brilliance of the film is that it makes us see his point of view. Of course, this is also where the film makes itself vulnerable to attack because anybody who goes out and murders somebody, and happens to have a copy of the DVD, can be said to have been ""warped"" by the films 'pro-violence' message. The film is about as pro-violent as American History X is pro-Nazi, but unfortunately far too many people are unable to watch a film with an open mind, or a view to learn something new, and so the message goes over their heads. *SPOILER* If NBK had ended with Mickey and Mallory being killed by a relative of one of their victims then I'm sure everybody would applaud it's ""profound message of evil never triumphs"". Instead, Mickey and Mallory escape from prison and are last seen walking into the sunset, so therefore Stone must like killers because he lets them live. Right? *END SPOILERS* How can you talk about NBK and not mention the fabulous look of the film? Shot on everything from grainy black & white 8mm to glossy Super 35mm, and using in excess of 2500 edits, the film is a visual feast. Stone uses 'vertical cutting' to show what a character is reading into a situation, rear projection to show what is influencing their thoughts and decisions and many other great techniques which make NBK the most unique film I have ever seen. Unlike Tony Scott's cinematic turd Domino the style is not done merely for the sake of it, to ""look cool"", it is done to place us amongst the chaos of the film. Plus, it looks really friggin' cool! I must also mention that all of the performances are top-notch. Harrelson and Lewis fit their roles perfectly and really convey that these two people love each other. Sizemore also gives a solid performance, as does Downey Jr, who is absolutely bloody hilarious! The best of the bunch, however, has got to be Tommy Lee Jones as the prison warden Dwight McClusky. He oozes with creepy redneck sliminess, but is also incredibly funny and charismatic.NBK is without a doubt one of the finest pieces of art ever produced. For years to come it will be talked about, and I'm sure it won't be long until another murder is blamed on it. NBK sets out to show us that we are far too obsessed with fame and celebrity, and in my opinion it does just that. The media makes celebrities out of criminals whilst people who deserve recognition go unnoticed. How many of the 9/11 victims can you name? How many doctors who have saved hundreds of lives can you name? How many of the Columbine victims can you name? Can you name the killers? Probably. THAT is what NBK is all about, and that is what it seeks to discourage.",Natural Born Killers
263,bringing-sexy-back,You've gotta see this one,10,13 May 2001,"I'd wanted to see Natural Born Killers for ages, but as it's not available in the UK at all, I haven't been able to. I watched it when it was on last night when it was shown on TV , with high expectations - and I loved it. Natural Born Killers is one of the most original, inspiring movies of the nineties. All the fuss made over it is unfair, OK it is quite violent, but I don't think Oliver Stone was glamorizing the violence, but instead trying to show what made Mickey & Mallory do it and how the media only encourages this, and turns them into icons. The acting was great too. If you haven't seen NBK, then you should try to see it soon, it really is something else. Brilliant - 10/10",Natural Born Killers
264,slcagnina,Technique versus Experience,5,13 June 2009,"This is a tough film for me to rate. On a technical level, as well as a balls-out fearlessness, I'd give this film a 10. It's a masterfully done movie which presents characters whom are cynical, and then proceeds to find secondary and tertiary levels of cynicism in these characters. It's relentless. The only non-cynical people are the killers, Mickey and Mallory.Is that a problem? I don't think so -- because the film exists in the media consciousness. It's really about the way the media needs cruelty, especially television media --- highlighted by the brilliant flashback of Mallory's family life; instead of drama, Stone presents it as a sitcom with Rodney Dangerfield as the boorish, pedophile dad. The presence of that canned laughter over horrific moments rounded off with punchlines makes you realize how phony and cruel real sitcom behavior is.But I can't score the film higher than a 5/10, and I think that's because of Stone. He's made some great movies, and Nixon is one of my favorites, but in this film he's probably the best and worst person who could've handled this material. His hallucinatory, multiple film stock and media style he created with JFK is perfect for this movie, and his willingness to blast messages is spot on as well. But that's also why the film is a tough, tough one to sit thru. It's full of blast -- it's loud, it's the loudest film I've ever seen, from the Trent Reznor soundtrack but mostly, from the emotionally dialed up characters and their whirlwind presentations. No character dials down, and I know the media is 24/7 and never shuts up and maybe Stone is relaying that. But a message is one thing, a story is another, and as a story, Natural Born Killers is a lot of noise about ideas and images that can hold for an hour, but are not enough alone to carry a full feature. You need some counterpoint, something beyond the continuous anger and emotional cynicism.This is a film that is peerless with technique, well acted and well directed, but also, with so little variance in terms of tone and ideas that it becomes a relentless, unpleasant experience. A movie about two psychopaths who get idolized by our culture doesn't scream out for pleasantness, I know, but nevertheless, if a film is so relentlessly unpleasant so as to be nearly impossible to sit thru, then the art of storytelling is amiss. Much to be admired, but awful to be experienced.",Natural Born Killers
265,crazydrazy,9/10 - brilliant.,10,4 August 2001,"I first heard from people how bad this movie was but lucky for me I watched it and found that those people were dopes. I figured it was bad as in bad directing, acting, etc. but the morons felt it was bad because it was nothing but mindless killing. I thought this movie was excellent and is one of my favorite films of all time in which I watch constantly! It ranks up there with The Wizard of Oz, Watership Down, Heathers, and Titanic.I laughed through this movie not because I think molesting, rape, and killing is funny, but more at the thought of all the fake happy people who were watching this and what they were thinking. The directing was great from the start: the two in a car driving through fake backgrounds with nothing but mind numbing music playing in the background...to the Sweet Jane seen...to the I Love Mallory scene... and the quite moving Will you Marry me Mallory scene. I thought that scene was very sweet and I realized the movie was more like a love story.People read way to much into it with the message and should just relax and go with the flow. I also don't think you can connect with the movie if you don't come from the same place the characters Mickey & Mallory come from. You know.... the ""a nauseating 2 hour MTV video"", the ""so many different types of filming & quick cuts it made me dizzy"", ""it was empty with mindless killings"". I think the movie would thank the viewers for all those comments because that is just what it is and wanted to be: empty, dizzying, unstable, with no-soul-type-of-movie like its Characters who ""just don't give a damn"". It was the type of film that kicked you in the face, punched you in the groin, spit on you while you were down and then kicked you somemore. It was an art film that threw all the colors on the canvas then smashed the canvas over your head. It was wonderful!People say they couldn't stand Woody Harrelson after this movie and I think they are idiots as well. He is an actor and did a great job of acting the part and like Oliver Stone and the rest of the cast, they all deserve a lot credit in taking a step out and doing a movie other safe directors and actors like Speilberg would be scared to do (although he gets credit for Shindler's List-something different from his usually safe family films). A definite cult-classic!Now the only reason why I won't give it ten stars is I thought the second half of the movie should have followed the first half in terms of visuals and I thought the directors cut was better with M & M dying. But still if a movie has everyone complaining and talking, it MUST BE GOOD!Rating 9/10and please..if you say i am sick from liking this film you are just as sick from liking all those cartoons and letting you kids watch them like looney toons where characters constantly stab, maime, beat, fry, and basically hurt each other to death. so please go check yourself.",Natural Born Killers

With films like JFK, Platoon, Nixon, The Doors, and Born on the 4th of July, Stone created personal, controversial marks in the world of cinema that have shocked the world. And Natural Born Killers is no exception. I believe that this is his second best film, second to Platoon. I love the way that he uses the camera in this film. It seems to glide awkwardly around the characters. I also appreciate the way that Stone chose to use color. Some shots would be shaded in only one color, such as red. Some shots were in black and white, as well. There is also a touch of animation that flashes at random during the middle of a sequence. As a director, he truly is an artist who uses his paint brushes wisely. The plot was very well thought out, too. He used Quentin Tarantino's script as a blueprint for the movie that we have today. This film comments on the absurdity of the media, and attacks it with guns blazing. Natural Born Killers also displays how violent violence can be, which is very similar to Stanley Kubrik's A Clockwork Orange. The love story between the main characters is one of epic, Shakespearian proportions. I understand that if Tarantino would have had the opportunity to direct this film, it would have been very different. I am a fan of Tarantino, but I believe that it would not have been able to be as artistic as Stone's version. It still would have been great, however.",Natural Born Killers
268,Cinema Buff,This film has been wrongly accused!,10,13 May 1999,"I recently had the pleasure of watching Oliver Stone's ""Natural Born Killers"" and I must say that this is truly a gem of a film.  I am seventeen years old and a junior in high school, and so I have heard quite a bit about how this film has corrupted us and turned us to violence.  I feel that the problem is that this film is being wrongly accused by people who have not even seen it.  My mother, when I mentioned that I rented it, responded by sticking her finger in her mouth in a gagging gesture.  She has not seen it yet, nor will she ever.  That is truly sad, because I believe that ""Natural Born Killers"" is a true declaration of how our society has become.The film traces Mickey and Mallory Knox, two mass murderers who kill 52 people on their honeymoon.  The movie is not about the killers, as the title implies.  For in the film are Wayne Gale (played by Robert Downey, Jr.), a tabloid reporter who will do anything to get a good story for his show ""American Maniacs"", and Jack Scagnetti (played by Tom Sizemore), a cop who will do anything to get his name known around the nation.  The film is about how these two fellows are able to turn Mickey and Mallory into national events.  The two murderers get numerous disciples and fan clubs (one teenager says to a news program, ""Sure, killing is wrong, but if I WERE a serial killer, I'd be Mickey and Mallory!"").  The tagline of the movie is, ""The media turned them into superstars,"" and that is what the film is about. This film, with its remarkable style and powerful message, is a wonderful movie for our time and one that I believe should be seen by those who are able to be open-minded enough to understand the true message that's being said here.",Natural Born Killers
269,mdisandro14,Disappointing,6,5 June 2019,After reading the plot of this movie and understanding its about a serial killing couple I thought this movie would be very cool watch.

These are damaged human beings, from horrific childhoods and traumas. Believe me, I'm really not a huge Stone fan. I mean come on, 'Something About Mary as the other of a football team? Please, I still laugh at the thought. And I totally get his hubris in trying to be clever, his ego demands it. But unless you live under a rock, you've had nightmares and your own demons to face. This film takes you into illogical minds, created from illogical tragedies. Even Scagnetti sees his mother blown away before his eyes as a child. I agree with a lot of people who say you'll either love this or hate it, its a lot to digest. But I'm happy to say this is a Stone film I appreciate, regardless of his always familiar flaws. All the flashbacks and tv all and nonsensical images show their back stories, from damaged minds. If you don't like violence, don't watch it. If you want a trip and an understanding into traumatized minds, then it's a must see...",Natural Born Killers

I knew once I saw the title it was going to be violent but the way it's represented is excessive. The way it's filmed with weird angles, crazy transitions, effects and filters became a torture for my eyes (I mean it literally tired my minds). I just knew why it was the film that inspired lot of murderers, the formula is grotesque.Maybe you would like it, because it has good points, good performances and known faces like Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Tommy Lee Jones...

272,wesleybh,"""...the Tale of Mickey and Mallory Knox""- Robert Downey Jr.",7,3 September 2008,"Let me start off by saying that the first time you see this movie you will be confused. There are metaphors randomly flashing through out random parts of the film. Once you understand what is going on, you realize that this movie is an art; another Oliver Stone master piece that almost measures up to Platoon.Natural Born Killers is violent and disturbing. The violent scenes are filled with unsteady camera angles and flashing between color film and black and white film. Many people have a problem understanding the purpose for creating this film, but it is quite simple, America's obsession with violence and its influence on the media. Don't go into the film expecting a great action film, be skeptical about what you see and you will enjoy it. NBK it not meant to be focused on violence, just the obsession. I fully understand why people hate this film, but I like it for the reasons people hate it. It was a great film with a great cast. Robert Downey Jr. (Wayne Gail) gives a brilliant and credible performance who represents the whole media in the world and its focuses on violence.10/10",Natural Born Killers
273,bhicks-2,back + forth,9,11 October 2000,"Every time I see this movie, I form a different opinion, and I always wonder... is this a good thing? I mean, I AM watching it again and again, yet I can't really grasp it the same way I do other movies. I do know I enjoy Oliver Stone's director cut more than the studio cut.Stone's movies are of an acquired taste for people. You either love him or hate him. I just think he's the kind of controversial director, much like Spike Lee, who either hits the mark, or doesn't. For the most part, he hits the mark here.NBK is visually groundbreaking and can easily fit into the top ten of inspired movies of the 90s though I'm not quite sure it fits the top ten best. When I first saw it in '94 at the age of 13, I was disturbed by it. I really didn't think Mickey and Mallory had anything in their personalities for the audience to root for as they went on pointless murdering sprees, beating the prison system, killing the ""media"" (which I always enjoyed:) and getting off with no punishments whatsoever. Stone's explanation is that this really does happen, and perhaps he is right. The movie starts off with such fiery anarchic energy as it switches from color, to b&w, to 8mm, to sitcom, to commercial, to locked away emotions, to acid trips, and to dreams broadcasted in hell. But, at the same time, I can't help but wonder if Stone's political ax grinding is too loud over what original screenwriter Quentin Tarantino had attended. Any fan can obviously hear QT's notes under Stone's symphony.... ""Bad asses never die."" And the Indian Shamen's story of the snake, just to mention a few. Plus, the rhythm slows down to a screechy stop near the end when M&M are in prison and attempt to escape. The whole thing with the demon and how love beats the demon sounds like preachy, superstitious b.s., and the riot takes an excrutiating long time as M&M escape. I think this hole in the movie is distracted by all the controversy this movie carries on its back, and all the ambitious visuals, hyper-editing, and unique style that carries the film to be praised by people.
NBK is also strictly a satire and should not be taken seriously, trust me, you'll enjoy it more when you view it this way. It's over-the-top can't you tell? Just watch the overacting of Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Downey JR., that's a pretty big hint. What can I say, I still don't have a complete opinion of it. So why am I posting a critique? Maybe I'll watch it again and see it through a whole new perception.",Natural Born Killers
274,streetsofla,"A dazzling, post-modern masterpiece",10,6 July 2001,"I was rather shocked by the amount of people on this page who gave this film a bad review. Sure Oliver Stone rams his `The Media creates heroes of killers' message right home with such a brutal and blatant force it hurts, but there's more to this than just it's deeper message.  It's a film of style, and great style at that. He use's his trademark of crossing different films stocks, cutting from Technicolor to stark black and white and overlaying sound tracks all over the place, but here he goes for all out extremeness.  Never before has a film looked like this, or even sounded like this. He crams so much into our faces in 5 minutes of this film than other directors have managed to do in their entire careers.  And he does it so much style and confidence that one can't help but be impressed. Maybe this is Stone's greatest achievement, pushing together everything the nineties stood for into 2 frantic and hectic hours, before slamming it's audience back to ground with unrelenting force, maybe not. But still it beats the unforgivable waste which is `Any Given Sunday'.",Natural Born Killers

The film is an annoying assault on the senses, often projecting non-sequitur words into the background and adding a laugh track to scenes for apparently no reason other than ""it would be really cool"".Everything about this overlong music video was apparently designed to make the viewers' heads explode: Woody Harrelson's terrible country-fried accent, Juliette Lewis' retardate imitation (something she has done in almost every one of her movies since...yeah, you're braindead, we get it), completely random and pointless killings (could we at least get SOME semblance of a motive?) and the utterly disgusting ""romance"" between the two that made me wish for nothing more than ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan to pop out of nowhere and give them three plugs each from his .44 magnum. Anything to end this tripe.",Natural Born Killers
276,Yossarian-,A Stunning Social Commentary,10,20 February 2000,"'Natural Born Killers' is very possibly the finest movie to emerge from the 1990's, epitomising all that is wrong with American, and indeed Western, society. In that sense it is a scathing social commentary. The style is big, bold and very intense, making it the perfect representative of 1990's cinema.The plot, which at times resembles a wild bucking horse, is driven forwards by the two lead characters, Mickey and Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis), as they blaze across the desert of southern USA (on 'Highway 666') leaving a trail of bodies behind them. Their motivation is never fully explored, though it is revealed that both were traumatically abused by their parents as children. Perhaps they are seeking revenge against a world that has long tortured them, or maybe the demons which were created within them are merely being released. Whatever the motivation, the result is 50 dead ('52, but I'm not counting').The tale of Micky and Mallory Knox is adopted and hyped into a frenzy by the media, primarily narcissistic TV presenter Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jnr), star of American Maniacs, itself a sick parody of the plague of television series' that cash in on the 'morbidity/human suffering factor'. It is here that Stone lays the weight of his message, that the media brought the exploits of the Knox couple to national attention and to an extent made their actions allowable. Public response to the Knox's polarises into those that want Mickey and Mallory fried and those that want to actually BE the killers. Eventually the couple are captured by police in one of the most spectacular scenes I have ever seen, climaxing in a dramatic parallel to the King beating.As the story continues Stone expounds upon a further theme during the live interview between Wayne and Mickey, that of 'pre-destination' (for want of a better word), though Mickey does not elaborate upon this. To do so would slow the pace down too greatly. Stone does return to this second theme throughout the prison riot chapter but the lightening pace of things leaves the audience with little time to fully comprehend it.Watching 'NBK' is a audio-visual treat, simply like none other I have ever seen (though 'Wild At Heart' would come the closest). Stone uses pretty well all possible types of film stock available from 35mm through to Camcorder and even animated comics. It was a dangerous gamble, but the 11 month period it took to edit the footage has resulted in a flawless visual and audio masterpiece. There is not one cut that I would change at all in 'NBK', from the menacing opening titles to the closing rolling credits. On top of the visual eyecandy (filters, digital effects, etc) are the credited 50-or-so song audio soundtrack. Music constantly accompanies the visuals, flicking from song to song as the pace demands. The two minute intro credit scene alone contains about a dozen song tracks. Many have described 'NBK' as boring and tedious. I am a little unsure what to make of these criticisms as I barely blinked in the first hour (and I KNOW I didn't blink at all in the second). The pace is rollercoaster fast and the visuals kept my eyes glued to the screen at all times. If people got nothing from the message the least 'NBK' gave them was one hell of a ride. In short, the visuals are impeccable, the shots never held for more than a few seconds (in fact, come the live interview, shots that are held for a line seem eternal), and the music brilliantly accompanies the action and pace.I feel it necessary to comment on the violence in the movie, as there have been many comments directed to the excessive amount of it. I beg to differ. There is very little gore in 'NBK' (well, the standard release anyway). There is violence ever-present throughout the movie, though usually it involves one of the characters shooting a victim off-screen. Occasionally there are flickers of gore, for example as Mickey and Mallory drive past a barn a photo of a badly damaged head is superimposed over the barn wall for perhaps a second. Yes, this is quite disturbing and I sure would rather not see it, but it has to be said that there are a plethora commercially released movies with more graphic on-screen violence, such as the face-transplant scene in 'Face/Off'. Maybe one of the reasons why 'NBK' caused so much stir over the violent content (despite the R rating) was that it didn't glorify violence. For example in 'NBK' a dead human was not a symbol of freedom ('Braveheart', 'Saving Private Ryan') or someone who suffered a slapstick death ('Commando', even complete with comedy line: 'let off some steam'), instead a dead human was merely that: a carcass, devoid of life or emotion. We are so used to seeing violence portrayed in a humorous (ie. 'Home Alone 1, 2 & 3', 'Denace the Menace') or vengenceful (ie. 'The Rock', 'Falling Down') manner that a movie that portrays violence with truth is found shocking and controversial. The violence in 'NBK' is a commentary of the state of modern USA, not a cheap attraction to win over audiences (which is far more noble than most other movies can boast).I personally think it all works. At the end of the movie I was left stunned at what I had seen. I showed the movie to my father and we sat and talked about it for some time. 'NBK' is not a satire, comedy, thriller, action or a piece of trash, it is a social commentary. It is a critical observation of modern American society. The story is exaggerated, but not beyond plausibility, and that's the terrifying part. To describe 'NBK' as pretentious is a little absurd, as I've yet to see anything that outdoes it. Not for traditionalists or the conservative-minded.",Natural Born Killers

I certainly enjoyed the first half, Mickey and Mallory on the run and their backstory, but things turned a bit dismal and predictable as they were caught and the TV/Jail ""overly-long"" sequence began.

It really does take a lot for a movie to shock me but I was practically left in awe by the end of this one, wether that's a good or bad thing I really don't know.Whilst the film is truly shocking and violent, there is some method to the madness as the movie is clearly one big satire of the media and the way it seemed to glamorise serial killers, which resulted in original screenwriter, Quentin Tarantino, disowning the movie due to its satirical and disturbing nature.The bizarre yet brilliant style and cinematography also added some extra points on to my final score.

282,grkhetan,"Nice for the Thoughtful, Bad for the Rest",8,12 May 2003,"There are three different ways a movie can be evaluated according to me: 1. How the viewer ""feels"" during and immediately after seeing the movie. 2. The art, skill and talent put into making the movie. 3. How it changes the viewers of the film in the long run from the aspect of knowledge, understanding, perspective, behavior, morality, culture, etc. An important question is - which one of those questions is the most important? The movie critics mostly assume the second question to be the most important. A typical film viewer assumes the first one to be the most important. What do you think about the importance of the third?From the 1st questions point of view, the movie will cause the viewer to be ""highly disturbed"". Many people will simply reject this film, and will not even be able to sit through the complete movie. I myself had to garner up lots of courage to just keep my hand from pushing the stop button throughout the movie. The movie is ""real bad"" if you think the answer to the first question is the most important for you, and hence you should stay away from the movie.From the 2nd question point of view, although I do not have much knowledge of film critiquing, I can estimate that the movie is quite good artistically. The movie's direction, music, special effects, screenplay is quite good. However, the 3rd question is the most interesting for a movie like Natural Born Killers. The intention of the movie, as the makers of the movie would want to emphasize, is to make the general public realize that proper ""culturing"" of kids, young people is necessary for the society to sustain itself. If there is no concept of morality induced into people, especially when they are young, they may grow up into anti-social elements. And moreover, the current state of American Society is lacking the culturing exactly which is essential. So the questions raised by this movie in my mind were:- Is it necessary to have a proper culturing of the masses for them to behave morally? Or will they ""just understand""? Is the right to expression of ideas by way of showing violence on the TV screen and the big screen more important than telling people what is right and wrong and how to behave yourself? Is the media' role more as a user ratings seeker or as communicator of culture? Thus there seems to some interesting thought provoking stuff out here (the questions are not new - but it still raises questions - which most movies just don't do), but there exists a PRIMARY PROBLEM with the movie which is quite obvious. The film might be thought provoking in the right sense to only a small fraction of the viewers - perhaps those who are willing to think. However, for the vast majority of the audience, the film may have the opposite effect to that what it wants to have. It will teach them violence. The film will serve to do exactly what it tries to say as ""wrong"": it will show audience that violence is not a wrong thing - violence is normal. This is a very strong negative point of the movie. Comparison with Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange: The Stanley Kubrick Masterpiece was way above this movie. 1: Disturbing, though much less than Natural Born Killers.2: Artistically much better than Natural Born Killers.3:  Clockwork Orange raised more deeper and more novel questions than Natural Born Killers. The questions directly raised by Clockwork Orange in my mind were: What is the basis of morality? Why should you behave morally? Why are most people in the world behaving more or less morally? How would you convince a person to behave morally? Is simply establishing association between immorality and feeling sick enough? Is simply establishing association between immorality and getting punished enough? Is morality only important for not getting punished or is there something higher? Is establishing an association between immoral behavior and feeling sick equivalent to convincing him what is right and wrong? Is religion only for convincing people to behave morally? Can religion give a logically sound reason for behaving morally?Why should I care about others? Is today's politics only about trying to win votes, or they really try to think about the people? And the basic problem present with Naturally Born Killers that it may actually germinate violence in the viewers is not present in Clockwork Orange because Clockwork Orange shows more cultured and less anti-social behavior than harmful. In Conclusion, watch Clockwork Orange(my rating 10/10), and avoid Naturally Born Killers(my rating 7/10).",Natural Born Killers
283,HISTORY_OAC_gheins,none,9,10 December 2009,"As a young man trapped in an everlasting inner monolougue, chasing after the irrelevant and unattainable answer to the question ""why?"", Natural Born Killers had an especially significant impact on me. I feel like the point of the film was too make comment on the foul way in which the masses have lost touch of reality in a world inundated with an everflowing waterfall of misguiding media. And this Oliver Stone observation couldn't be more astute. We are a generation living vicariously through a TV screen. The bigger the screen, the better the life. People will ignore the harsh realities of a violent world, because from their point of view (a soft couch in a warm room) violence and immorality almost become surreal. This point is especially driven home by the crowds of people who applaud Mickey and Mallory for their murders, giving them celebrity. How would these fans feel about Mickey and Mallory if the two brought their murderous ways directly to them? The film falls on the same line as Fight Club, a commentary that touches on the the confusion involved in the modern person's life. Once the hippy generation won their war against establishment, their successors were left to live in a world marked by the illusion of choice. Americans are free because we have the ability to choose the direction we want to take our lives in. But we are slaves because the things that dictate our lives on the most fundamental level(media, education, social expectations) are so oppositional from what really motivates us. Is any human born with a burning desire to be a professional anything? Or instead, is proffesionalism a way of providing the illusion of choice, the illusion of individualism, and most tragic; the illusion of happiness.",Natural Born Killers

NBK beats you over the head, pounding the viewer nearly senseless until there's no genuine irony or satire at all.

I hated it back when I saw it (I was in the sixth grade by the way), I didn't care for it as the years went by, then, just over a year ago, I rediscovered a masterpiece . . .Oliver Stone.  What can I say.  Hands down, he's my favorite filmmaker, because he takes risks and has a firm vision, doing things HIS way for all theses year, WITHIN the cynical studio system.  From the beginning of his career, he's had the heat follow him, being unfairly tagged and bludgeoned, creating controversy at every turn.  And ""NBK"" is no exception.  In fact, I believe it's one of the most controversial films ever made, because it still has such a major effect on society today.  It's being blamed for murder after murder, which completely confirms the film's message, that society is media-obsessed.  I mean, how exactly can you SUE a movie for the act of someone that was insane to begin with, and chose to perform the act ON THEIR OWN?  The movie doesn't say, ""Hey!  Go out and murder because you saw me!""""NBK"" is also the most misunderstood film of today.  The critics were split, and a certain Leonard Maltin couldn't see it for what it is:  sheer brilliance.  It's attacked for everything, and the MPAA had their heads in their back sides while rating this, if you know what I mean.  And what's with this DIRECTOR'S CUT?  It disappointed me in some areas, especially when the Nine Inch Nails song ""Burn"" was removed from the ending; that was my favorite part.  The ""Scagnetti-Pinky"" scene was HORRIBLY EDITED:  Pinky's bra flashes on and off simultaneously, a mistake that seems so obvious. And the deleted ""extras"",well, they're worthless.  But I did like the restored prison sequences, in that they convey a tighter feeling of chaos and mayhem. In short, make up your own mind.  I personally was more predisposed to the withstanding form.So if you are unaware of the film's plot, it's simple:  Harrelson and Lewis are murdering lovers on the lam who become major cult objects on their rampage and soon become exploited by Wayne Gale (Downey), only to survive a prison riot being broadcasted on live t.v.

295,Alex-506,The worst movie-watching experience of my life.,1,20 May 2001,"I love Oliver Stone.  I think he is one of the best directors working right now.  He has produced one of my favourite movies (JFK) and two other excellent ones (Nixon and Platoon).  I can not understand what he was thinking with this one.Stone attempts to put forth a satirical comedy which indicts the media's unhealthy obsession with violence.  This is hardly a new idea, I've been saying that the media over-glamorizes violence for about twenty years. Stone pounds away at this one point with a complete absence of humour, satirical insight and most of all compassion.The movie is incredibly violent, but I have no problem with violence in movies.  I loved GoodFellas, and that was a very violent movie as well (although nowhere near this bad).  But GoodFellas has an incredible amount of truth about humanity in it.  This movie has no truth whatsoever.Worse, Stone becomes hypocritical near the end of the movie with his stupid prison-break sequence which plays like a standard overly violent action movie.  This sequence makes you feel cheated and conned, in addition to be drained by the rest of the movie.The cinematography is a joke.  Stone used a similar style (although not nearly as noticeable) of quick-cutting in JFK.  However, in that movie, when the camera changed angles, when we went from colour to black-and-white and back again, there was a purpose, and it made you feel something.  This just plays like an MTV video.The movie really assumes we are stupid and can't get Stone's message.  In comparison, look at an excellent satire, The Truman Show, which was also an indictment of the media.  But The Truman Show knew that it had to present more than one witty point over and over again.  It was also about our own tenuous grasp on reality and our yearning for new experiences.  Natural Born Killers, in comparison, plays like a demented Saturday Night Live sketch dragged on about 115 minutes to long.The movie just sits there, moving, flashing, making noise, but it's all empty, all blank, and without a point to it.  You sit there watching back, equally blank and empty.  The movie really is a natural born killer.  It kills you two hours at a time, every time you watch it.",Natural Born Killers

297,rylojr1977,"Go in with an open, receptive mind & you'll be surprised.....",8,16 May 2007,"There was a massively hostile reception towards this film when it first did the rounds here in Britain. It was even originally refused a video release as a result of cynical ""concerned"" political pressure from MP's and media hysteria in the wake of the James Bulger murder. I believe that attempting to manipulate public feelings towards the shocking, savage murder of a little boy for one's own political gain shows who the real evil people in our society are.Having looked at interviews with the filmmakers, primarily Oliver Stone, and looking at the film in the context of the time it was shot and the decade-plus that has followed it, Natural Born Killers was strangely prophetic. We live in a media age, where everything is obsessively recorded and replayed. Stone's film goes way beyond the simplistic Tarantino outline and adds the media-as-evil angle. This may seem simplistic and a get-out clause for Stone, but I for one cannot watch televised news or read newspapers without being inwardly sceptical. Particularly in Britain. We have a tabloid gutter press to be ashamed of, written by idiots for imbeciles. Maybe that's why films like this get labelled with ""violent/shock/murder/gun/video/banned/outrage"" tags by our particular media.Get past the violence  which is always a stumbling block for many people  and you will see that it is an engaging, exciting film, with wild, original characters and a great soundtrack. It is a genuine risk-take that is all too rare in Hollywood output these days. In terms of entertainment value, there is much guilty fun to be had here. Contrary to many reports, this film will not make you go out and kill your parents.It will however, dazzle you and make you think about the world around you a bit more. Think people...OPEN YOUR EYES. Turn on Sky News, CNN, BBC News 24What do you see? Images of school shootings in the US, daily carnage in Iraq, Afghanistan, Checheyna; bombings in London, Spain, Turkey, Bali..Not make believe is it? Maybe some of the censorship policy makers, who feel that we are not adult or mature enough to watch fantasy stories with sex or violence, are trying to take the light off the more important issues which are in our faces every day. I have yet to see anything in a piece of fictional filmed entertainment that has the same power or horror as any random night spent watching the news. Praise be to the internet. At least it is free of censorship and ridiculous political fear-mongering.Isn't it..????",Natural Born Killers
298,Aeirould,Oliver Stone at his best,9,25 June 2003,"This movie can be hard to watch.  Given its subject matter, it *should* be.A lot of the detractors of this movie can't seem to ""get past"" the stylization of it - the I Love Mallory sequence, the Jim Morrison sequence, etc.  The whole *point* of those sequences, though, is to show how pop culture idolizes the serial killer.Whoever wrote the first of the post-Asimov Foundation books got it right - people like that should have their names expunged and just referred to as ""Moron #"", rather than by their name.  This idolatry of the violent is dangerous for society as a whole.This movie expresses that far better than I can, though - go watch it. See it as what it is - a deconstruction of American celebrity.  Don't try to watch it as a popcorn flick - if you do, it *will* fail.  (deleted), if you can eat while watching this, you're already too far gone.",Natural Born Killers

This movie is a SATIRE crime film that tries to make a point about how mass killers are glamorized, which is more true today than ever with social media and whatnot.This is a movie chock full of symbolism and double meanings which you have to watch a few times to properly understand. It's amazingly shot, incredibly violent, and has an amazing plot and dialogue. Although I always wondered what Tarantino's version would've been like had he ended up doing this movie instead.I'm not going to give any spoilers but it's a love story made in hell and it's a crazy ride.

Too often and too superficially compared to Tarrantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" (both are dark, violent comedies about young criminals within the American underclasses), it may actually be the better film.  It certainly deserves a second look -- or a first look by those who stayed home because of the initial reviews.",Natural Born Killers

This movie is more than just eye candy, it's a demented love story that also works as social commentary about the 1990s'. It shows how fascinated the media is with murder, and how we also encourage this.  Stone is really blunt about this and makes the movie near unwatchable, but how else can he send the message across more effectively? An excellent movie with great over the top performances; this is a must see film.",Natural Born Killers
304,kylezombie,"Good social commentary, but that's as far as it goes *spoilers*",1,2 July 2000,"What is said about the media in this movie is absolutely true.  The media puts so much hype into mass murderers and psychopaths that they are as glorified as movie stars. However, I did not understand whether Oliver Stone wanted us to just ponder about our society, or to root for the two main characters.  They were products of terrible childhoods, but that doesn't condone their actions. He states that the media is the bad guy, but as the movie progresses, he makes the main characters more and more glorified in the news.  He makes his characters more ""appealing.""  He's almost contradicting himself.  It's not until the end that they put an end to Robert Downey, Jr.'s character that there is a justified murder.  He was the one who was to blame for their allure. I think that people should see this just to re-think their views of today's media, but shouldn't take the film itself too seriously.",Natural Born Killers
305,the-gil-monster,A stunning and provocative tour de force- provided you're 12 years old,2,3 August 2008,"I actually hadn't seen this film until just recently. My wife was telling me how awesome it was when she saw it way back in her high school days, and how she'd like to see it again to see how it holds up. It doesn't. ""Natural Born Killers"" is one of those movies for film students to act like they like.Oliver Stone- who proves as adept with satire as beluga whales are with unicycles- tells the story of Mickey and Mallory Knox, a husband and wife pair of self-obsessed, boorish thrill-killers who travel the highway and shoot and stab people whenever they feel like it. But before you pass judgment, know that their prison warden (Tommy Lee Jones), the television cop out to arrest them (Tom Sizemore) and a ghoulish TV reporter (Robert Downey Jr.) are ALSO all psychotically unhinged idiots. So whenever Mick and Mal blow away a terrified waitress after a game of ""Eeny-Meeny-Miney-Moe"", go easy on them, okay? They're the GOOD GUYS, after all.In a pitiful attempt to camouflage NBK's train wreck of a story, Stone imbues the film with bizarre and ""trippy"" visuals such as modern-day graphics superimposed over graphics, constant switches between color film and black-and-white, and footage of other movies, like the far more entertaining ""Night Of The Lepus"". I've stripped a star from its rating because of every crappy modern-day horror film director that saw this over-budget student film as inspiring (I'm looking at you, Mr. Zombie).Especially when Mick and Mal talk about their love/scream at each other in the same manner as the preteens this film was likely targeted at, forcing us to concentrate on the film's soundtrack (which is, thankfully, incredibly good.) The performances are also well done and in the spirit of the original screenplay, and the film is indeed memorable, though I'm not sure if that's really a good thing. I also liked how an adrenaline-packed shoot-out is just what any man needs to stave off the hemotoxin from a rattlesnake bite, and how our prison system would gleefully let the Most Dangerous Man In America dance and joke about in a room full of shotguns while a full-scale prison riot rages. The celebrity of serial killers indeed warrants discussion (and if that idea disgusts you, then stop dressing up like a pirate on Halloween.) But sorry, Ollie: let Tarantino do Tarantino- instead of being irritating, self-indulgent and hypocritical, the film would merely have been irritating and self-indulgent. All I got from this overlong rock video was a yearning for ""Night of The Lepus""- and when your high-quality art-film persuades its viewers to see giant rabbits tear apart a Texas town, just strike the set.Only see ""Natural Born Killers"" if you're a zebra who loves to hear the lions preach to you about how awful and despicable those darned hyenas are. 2/10.",Natural Born Killers
306,torturedsoul,An unbelieveable movie,10,20 June 2001,"When I first saw NBK, I thought I would be in store for useless violence that had nothing to do at all with anything that resembles anything in society. When I finished it, I felt I had witnessed a movie that is a perfect portrait of society. A portrait that is possessed by the greedy hands of the media. A portrait that shows all of us what the media is all about. Of course Mickey and Mallory deserved to be punished for the crimes they committed, but Wayne Gale and his media ratings-feast glorified the two lovers and made them look like loveable characters so nice they could be in a feature cartoon next to Mickey  and Minnie Mouse. So for people that criticize NBK for its violence, think about this: instead of dissecting NBK's content, you should dissect the media and ask yourself what they are all about.

307,mackey3000,"Forget a great film, this is a terrific HUMANE achievement!",10,7 July 2005,"Oliver Stone's aggressive, in-your-face, timeless bloodsoaked masterpiece NATURAL BORN KILLERS is a film that NEVER gets old! The power it has the first time you see it is exactly the same power you'll feel when you see it for the eight or ninth time. This is one of those movies like REQUIEM FOR A DREAM that is just ridiculously AMAZING! It's hard to believe a filmmaker who's just a regular human being like everyone else could succeed so perfectly and astonishingly in capturing and showing every single message and critique he wanted to put in the forefront. Though it's sharp, audacious, angry, unapologetic, eye-opening satirical attack on the greedy and soulless disgrace that is mainstream media, and the awe-striking way in which it constantly shows in so many different ways why the media is such a lying fear-promoting monster, is what makes it such a MONUMENTALLY important film, it would be brilliant film-making even without it. Stone has always been one of the most energetic, ambitious, and visually creative filmmakers in America, and he uses those skills to the max in this, the standout of his amazing career. Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis couldn't have nailed the psycho persona, and all the different emotional and psychological wreckage that comes with it, more dead-on! But the real acting standout of this film is the wonderful Robert Downey Jr.'s remarkable, raw, unforgiving, explosively hysterical turn as media scumbag Wayne Gale. He may have a Robin Leach-like accent, but don't be fooled: There is no doubt that this is f**king Geraldo Rivera IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY! I'm surprised Rivera wasn't throwing the same disgraceful, disgusting, and shamefully self-righteous hizzy fit that the pathetic John Grisham threw, since the film captures (with a depressingly small amount of exaggeration) everything that makes Geraldo such reprehensible media vermin. To all the people who said this film was responsible for inciting violence: Shame on you! Isn't it funny that the vicious and dangerous moral and PC police always targets the best films? Like DOGMA, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, this is one of the most socially conscious AND socially valuable films of it's time. And, like REQUIEM, it is a film that puts most film-making to shame and transcends the power of it's medium, thus becoming not just a great film, but a terrific humane achievement.

OK so maybe my expectations were too high. Coming from a story by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Oliver Stone, i was expecting almost a masterpiece, but all i've got is 2 hours of trashy, cheesy, pointless crap. There is really no apparent storyline, and even if there was, the editing is so jumpy and fast it's hard to keep up with it! The dialogue is diabolical which creates zero affection or engagement with the characters, and the camera-work is so amateur it makes me think if they picked up a drunk old guy from a local pub and threw him a camera at him.

That a downright awful film gets a cult following because of it's director (or screenwriter), however, is more rare. What made so many people crazy about this film, apart from loyalty to ""annoy-the-establishment"" Oliver Stone is beyond me. It's not funny. At all. In fact, the parts that were supposed to be ""funny"" made me even more angry than the ""provoking"" parts of his other movies (the deleted scene with the courtroom was so sadistic it made me want to see Stone and Tarrantino's heads on plates - and i usually like Tarrantino's films). It's not suspenseful either, since you're hoping the main characters get killed through the entire movie. Finally it's not original -it's been done a million times before. So basically i just felt sick and angry. And who goes to the movies to get angry and sick? Stone is trying to rant about the hypocrisy of modern media while making a total gorefest for millions of moviegoers to see. Now who's hypocritical?

Another brilliant thing about this film and which i praise tarantino for is there is no sequel even after ten years. What i loved about the film like all tarantino films, its so confusing and so bizarre you just have to watch and ultimately it keeps your interest, what more could you want.

Oliver Stone is Cinema! tHat's why to some people ""natural born killers"" appears odd. It is not about what is being told, but how it is being told.  One must try to step beyond metaphores and allow for metanarratives. This film is about everyone but Mickey and Mallory, it is about the natural born killers, it is about a society governed by the TV box and living in the spectacle of the TV box, where every experience of living has been transformed the animated image of TV shows. There is nothing original in what Oliver Stone tells us - it is about how our behavious now governed by the standards of the TV discourse.  Yes this is the basic thesis of Guy Debord, but what is new is how that thought is transmitted.  Last but not least it is new to Holliwood.    Everyone in this movie is sick.  So sick that M & M appear innocent and natural, in comparrison to the law-abiding citizens.     I first saw this film when I was 15.  What happened that night might be yet anoher wild story of individual liberation (maybe to be told in the future), so wild that it just may supercede the Natural Born Killers.

If you have checked my rating(which is quite possible) you will have already understood that i belong to the lovers of this movie and i don't believe that you will find many in the middle.I mean this movie is made to separate people into two contradicting sides.So i ain't gonna explain why i liked it so much....what i am gonna do is to fight the opposite side,always with good intentions...I don't believe that the point of the movie is to show two psychopaths serial killers and their daily routine, but, firstly, to make clear that mass media have chosen such subjects to attract viewers.The main point of the movie is blatant.In every second we can see that mass media,TV mostly,are the ""third eye"" through that,sometimes, a person see the world.For example if somebody make love with a woman or man what his/her third eye does is to make he/she see porn or beautiful sex scenes from his/her favorite TV series or rocky balboa making love his sexy wife and i don't know what else and that's media content.The main point is that one of the most important sources of association of ideas is mass media(TV mostly)and media needs characters that will attract and allure the viewers such as two natural born killers.In this movie these associations of ideas are shown through the Knox couple whose minds are already harmed from their childhood and the only thing that they get in return is ""information"".The information that TV gives which make them go nuts.They know that their new parents are mass media and they finally get to understand that media is not that better than their previous parents.I believe that oliver stone didn't want to underestimate common people and make two psychopaths look better but to show that these two psychopaths are partially a national product and this product has the support of justice ,science and government in order to stay active and profitable.",Natural Born Killers

321,courtjester,contradicts its supposed message,1,23 July 2001,"*Spoilers* Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is brilliant criticism of the media obsession with violence. But this contention ignores the actual content of the film. Oliver Stone could have shown his serial killers as vicious, inhuman murderers of innocent people and contrasted this with a morbid media fascination. Instead he lends them justification.  The movie portrays just about every victim as someone who deserved to be hurt. Engaging in vicious stereotyping, Stone presents the victims as unpleasant caricatures - dumb rednecks, broken-English speaking immigrants, lazy fat people.  The one person that the homicidal lovebirds is also a stereotype. Of course they befriend the old, hallucinogen-using American-Indian - because they're trendy, dude? Let's make him an admirable character.  Fat, Chinese clerks and ""hicks"" are uncool, so let's make it seem like the deserve to die. Instead of twisted,hateful that are corrupted by their misdeeds, their rampage makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are made sexy and cool and surreal visuals are bound to entice more impressionable people. Justice is mocked.  The police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal, ugly and scowling compared to the GQ murderers. Again, this is not in the media reports within the film but in the ""reality"" in the film. There is no nuance or subtlety in the film - just overblown performances and visuals. The film says nothing new or specific about the obsession with violence. The proof that the film fails in its message lies in actual real world reactions to it. Some impressionable young people who saw this movie cited it as inspiration for murders that they committed. The film's ""message"" is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with horrendous real-life results.  The clever message is nowhere to be seen.",Natural Born Killers
322,timskinsella,The satire doesn't quite work,4,12 October 2021,"This film is very clearly having a go at the way the American media obsesses over violence and violent people, but the problem is that the movie indulges so much in the vile behaviour of its main characters, Mickey and Mallory Knox, that it falls short of successfully delivering its message.The audience is not only positioned to sympathise with the serial killers, but to admire them, so it's easy to see why the film has inspired a great deal of real-life violence over the years.Black comedies superior to this are better able to distance the audience from the psychotic characters in the film. Usually, the psychopaths get their comeuppance, but this is far from the case in Natural Born Killers as it's all happy ever after for Mickey and Mallory.Visually, this movie is incredibly cartoonish, and crooked camera angles are overused to the point that it becomes headache-inducing. Conceptually, however, the film is far from cartoonish, and genuinely disturbing.There were parts of this film I enjoyed, and/or appreciated. The soundtrack is fantastic. I am generally a fan of Tarantino's screenplays, although in this instance I feel as though the film would have suffered more if he had directed it. Overall, the movie has some things going for it but ultimately fails to work as a satire or black comedy.",Natural Born Killers

Woody Harrelson was beautifully creepy and evil.Most people will dwell on the violent actions of Mickey and Mallory and miss the art that Stone has created. The editing is really outstanding. I love the visual styling of the movie. I can watch the movie repeatedly and see more depth each time.Those of you that hate this movie need to give it another chance.

324,tomgould749,Brilliant,10,3 July 2016,Supreme this film is as harrowing as it is visually stunning. Harrelson and Lewis portray serial killers with an almost perfect level of subtle menace that makes you almost want to route for them. The sheer magnitude of the piece is electric and Tarantino and Stone weave together a piece of artwork that should be watched and respected by any die hard movie fan. Although it has been dismissed by some as somewhat repetitive I would be inclined to argue that any film that deals with this topic needs to be reminded of the fact that in the evil world that these people inhabit repetition comes with the territory. It is the way that it is delivered though that makes it stand out.,Natural Born Killers
325,TheHip14,One of the most important films in the last 25 years.(Minor Spoilers),9,7 August 2005,"Natural Born Killers is unlike any film you have ever seen before. It challenges us, it insults us an it shows us who we are, where we are and where we are going. The movie is essentially about two people who were terribly abused as kids and now they have grown up, fallen in love with each other and gone on a killing spree. The movie then shows how the entire nation is absolutely obsessed with these two serial killers Micky and Mallory. Micky and Mallory's fans adore them. One guy says that he values human life but if he were to become a serial killer he would be Micky and Mallory. It is kind of sick to see this nation obsessed with these serial killers. And who's fault is this. the media's. The media glorifies them, they make them superstars, the media keeps doing it because the audience is eating it up and the media gets their ratings. People love seeing violence and hearing about it on TV. Yet by drawing us to this movie and making us watch it is Oliver Stone insulting us? By going to see this movie we are the same as the people in the movie. In the movie the people are drawn to their TV sets to see the latest about these two serial killers. While we flock to see this movie which is essentially about these two serial killers. And then admit it, we are cheering for them at the end of the movie when they escape. We are the same as Micky and Mallory's fans in the movie. This movie could be one of the most important films in the last 25 years or it could be viewed as one of the least important movies in the last 25 years. It is important because it shows us where we are and where we are going. By viewing this movie you realize that if the media continues to glorify these serial killers and we continue to eat it all up and worship them then will we essentially become serial killers to either get media attention or to follow our heroes? Yet this film might not be important at all. Do we already know that we are media hungry and do we know that the media usually shows stories with a bad ending because they know that is what we like. Do we know that we love these serial killers and are cheering for them even though what they are doing is abhorrent? Are we aware of it and don't even care? Well whatever the case is Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers is a real eye opener. It takes a few viewings to fully understand but once you understand it, it hits you that what he is saying is true and you start to realize it. You turn on the news and you see the stories they show. You turn on the T.V. and you see hundreds of fans cheering for O.J. at his trial. Or even more recently hundreds of fans cheering for Michael Jackson. This film might insult us at the beginning but then it turns us around and makes us realize what kind of society we live in and we thank the film for that.Every main character in this film is essentially evil. The thing is though that Mick and Mallory are probably the best characters in the movie. They realize they are evil, they admit it, Micky says he's a natural born killers, they are also somewhat remorseful. Yet, Wayne, Scagnetti, and the Warden are all evil but don't realize it.Wayne is just a money hungry tabloid reporter. In the interview with Micky he doesn't care what Micky's saying he just wants good ratings. He doesn't care about what anyone says, if it gets him good ratings then that's fine. That is why at the end no one sends helicopters to find and save him. Because no one cares about him.Scagnetti is also evil. He is a corrupt cop who has a huge ego. He kills that girl for no reason. Then he tries to make a move on Mallory and ends up getting beaten up by her. He also issues a beating on Micky when the cops catch him outside the drugstore.The warden just wants fame. He'll let anyone do anything in his prison if he will get recognition. He only wanted Mick and Mallory at his prison so he could get some recognition. He also treats his prisoners terribly. That is why they dismember him at the end Yet after all his said and done Oliver Stone will go down in history as one of Hollywood's greatest director's. For he shows his influential and interesting view of the future, past and present.",Natural Born Killers
326,commieluke,keep the camera still moron.,1,28 December 2005,"*CLANG-CLANG-CLANG* That's the sound of the movies message being relentless beaten into you. Other sounds that you might here during the film is the swallowing of headache tablets and the snoring of someone who's taken the easy way out leaving you to slog through the rest all alone.This film can be summed up in one word. You might pick garbage, tedious, or just plain stupid. But in he end i think we have a winner in obnoxious. Two words? Really obnoxious. I'm sure some people can come up with explanations for why the film switches between black-and-white and colour at random intervals, I'm sure the random use of slow-mo didn't strike them as odd, nor the lens switching. Some people can see the future in chicken guts, I guess if you look hard enough you'll always find what you're looking for. And did anyone else think ""Battlefield Earth"" with all the tilting camera shots? What is it with bad films and the inability to keep the camera level?I have no doubt the story was just as inane as the direction. Alas i can't remember a damn thing about it, maybe it didn't even exist. That'd explain all those directorial flourishes, who gets annoyed at the lack of plot when they've got a pounding headache? Bravo Mr. Stone! Bravo!When the film settles down for the second half (or maybe I just started blocking out all the tricks in a desperate bid to get to the end of the film without snapping in frustration) it gets slightly better, or more accurately less bad. It's still a terrible film but I was so relieved to be able to tell what was going on my opinion shot up from ""this film really really sucks"" to ""this film really sucks"". Adios Natural Born Killers, I hope never to watch you again.",Natural Born Killers
327,Darkknight575,Natural Born Killers has a bad rap,8,27 June 2004,"Natural Born Killers is a brilliant film and easily Oliver Stones best film after JFK. The greatness of Oliver Stone comes from the subject matter and the passion he brings to each project. Like all great filmmakers each time he makes a film he has something to say, and it's something that's important to him. Natural Born Killers is a statement on society even today and the media that stands to profit off of it. The United States is one of the only countries in the world that elects to cover a child kidnapping or a drive by shooting instead of important issues that stand to better the community. In this film Oliver Stone tackles the issues of our country and the amount of fame and coverage serial killers receive from the media. It delves deep into the characters to the point where we actually cheer for them at the end. These two people are murderers, killers, evil and sadistic people that we grow to care about. Why? Because we can relate to them and we have gotten to know them profoundly. Now I understand many people complain about the films editing. I found it refreshing and visually captivating as it fit the nature of the material. In other films, like his god awful attempt at the corruption of professional sports in Any Given Sunday, the editing there doesn't fit. It's too fast paced. Natural Born Killers takes us into a surreal landscape drawing us into the mindset of these two fascinating characters by being creative in it's editing techniques. The use of black and white, the images in the background, even the animation is all used for a reason. Many times creating a mood or feeling otherwise overlooked. The editing here is first rate. At no point do we get lost or confused by the images. It's never too fast. Even in the chaotic scenes like the prison riot we can clearly see what's happening. It's not like Armageddon where you can't tell what's going on. It's a real shame that many people haven't given this film the credit it deserves merely because it doesn't fit the standard format many people expect. Unlike many of Tony Scott's films where the editing is done just to be flashy, Oliver Stone, especially in Natural Born Killers, creatively used this unusual technique to benefit the film.",Natural Born Killers

329,CBD,One of the finest films of the 1990's,10,17 January 2002,"An Orgasm of twisted brilliance.  This film says it all.  It sums up our culture in two hours.  It shows us how we perceve murder and just play it off as some sort of joke.  It shows us how we can bring up brutal death and chat about it casually...without any remorse for those killed.  What we are served up is an eclectic collage of society and I loved every minitue of it. This movie is only for certain people who are smart enough not to pass it off as ""Rubbish"" (as other reviews have stated).  These are the people who wake up every day, go work, come home, fall asleep, wake up, go to work etc...and don't think about anyting else.  Whose horrizons are limited and don't know art when they see it. For you Brit's justifying any sort of ban on NBK all i can tell you is get a life. Your the type of conservative mindless mice running in a little wheel who want movies like ""A clockwork orange"" censored...fine...but we live in a free soceity...we're adults...do you need some government censor telling you what you can and can't watch?...I can make up my own mind thank you very much.-Dustin Cohen",Natural Born Killers

331,mgatton,Terrible,1,18 July 2005,To this date Natrual Born Killers is the only movie I have walked out of and demanded my money back. I must say out right that I can not stand Woody Harrelson in anything but Cheers and his subsequent work has tainted even that for me. Oliver Stone still just keeps pumping out this trash and calls it art. Everything he does feels agenda driven; sort of a glitzier version of Michael Moore's low rent Socialist Propaganda films.To the extent that I did watch this film I will say that I did find that Rodney Dangerfield played his part well. This was not his standard character.,Natural Born Killers
332,archyon,Obviously good script mis-directed by Stone,6,16 October 2000,"Don't get me wrong because of the one-line summary. I think Stone is a very good overall director (Platoon comes to mind), but Natural Born Killers is his all-time worse movie.It's not that I mind extreme violence. I'm a giant fan of Tarantino, and his script on the movie is obviously intelligent and witty. When it comes to the script, this movie is absolutely fine. But when it comes to the directing...I don't know what happened to Stone when he directed it. Maybe he was half-asleep, in a bad mood or just was tempted by the devil. But anyway, this movie has been turned by his inept direction into a juggernaut. A sinking juggernaut.The switches of color to black and white, the insane delusions, the below average soundtrack, the twisted colors, the worst joke ever in a movie - the absolutely stupid sitcom spoof, which is dumber then ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", which does make you crack in laughter - but because you are laughing at the director's stupidity.Once again, Stone is a great director. But I don't know what happened to him.P.S. If Tarantino would have directed it, it would surely be a masterpiece.

335,Scissorhands007,A Wretched Film that Had the Potential for Greatness,1,28 June 2007,"I regret having to give this film one star- zero stars isn't an option. Neither is negative 3 stars. That would've been acceptable. Quentin Tarantino has stated that he wants nothing to do with this film; and that is understandable. The sad thing about this is that if Tarantino's script had been kept (or, if Tarantino had kept that script for a few more years and made this instead of Jackie Brown,) this would've been a great movie. Sadly, however, the script was re-written and the film directed by Oliver ""Lotsa Guns Lotsa Sex"" Stone. The satire and social commentary Tarantino intended is lost; overshadowed by the gratuitous violence and ""trip shots,"" which are completely random shots of creepy things that interrupt the story and have absolutely nothing to do with the film and therefore should not have been included. Stone seems to have been more concerned with showing the audience that he can do all sorts of neat tricks with his camera than telling a meaningful story. Super 8, black and white, slow motion, fast motion, all right, we get it! What's the point? The film became everything Tarantino's original script stands against: a media car crash that's all style and no substance.",Natural Born Killers
336,barkerj-874-410111,"Probably not the best film ever made, but probably my favourite",10,28 April 2015,"My love for this film began for me aged 15 or so, when I chanced upon it showing on television. At the time I didn't really get it, instead I saw it at it's face value, an extremely stylish, extremely violent action movie that had strayed away from the mainstream, replacing blockbuster explosions with artistic merit. I always preferred this type of film, doing something almost entirely different. To this day, it's films like this that put other pictures to shame, done on a fraction of the budget, and built on passion from the entire team. Since then I've watched it, usually around twice a year. It's always a treat, and I always learn something new. Having recently seen Platoon, as well as an interview with Oliver Stone regarding this film just before my bi-annual viewing, I was able to see this film in a whole new light again. We can see how twisted the media has made this film clearly, but if we Look Closer, we can see just how twisted the guy is who made it. I don't mean twisted in a bad way of course. We can see Stone's whole philosophy towards life in this movie, it's chaotic and a little bit anarchic, but it isn't trying to suggest the worst in 'killers', only the insignificance of murder in the general scheme of things. I think going to war for Stone changed him completely, I don't know what he was like before, but his philosophy is more true to life than people want to accept. - One of the deleted scenes, the courtroom scene, we witness a woman who would swear in front of a court of law, her friends and her family, that Mickey Knox wasn't human, was incapable of being human, that somehow he was not of this earth, only in an attempt to protect her own lie about the events that had occurred during the murder of her husband. If she would look a fool out of herself to protect her little lie, then how much of a fool are we all looking by protecting our lies to ourselves, around the destructive nature of the world, of ourselves, of all the life we have killed. If you're to place a value on life, then it shouldn't matter whether it's intelligent or not. Mickey Knox claims to have 'evolved', I don't believe that, I believe he 'revolved', or devolved into an evolved state.It may sound like I'm babbling nonsense here, but I really believe the deeper message of this film is to basically get real about the nature of humanity and to remind ourselves that intelligence doesn't equal a right to live.",Natural Born Killers

338,smithwarrick,My worst movie. A repellent and unfocused mess,1,29 March 2006,"What I thought about while watching this movie was how very ugly it is. In many ways. Yes, some could argue that Oliver Stone is portraying the graphic violence here as making the viewer think ""hmm, Stone is testing me here. I'm enjoying watching this violence, but I shouldn't"" But for me, I hated these repellent characters. What they did, how they acted.There has to be some moments of humanity or grit in a violent movie about serial killing, or you just get stereotypes and a totally unpleasant movie experience. I hated how the characters didn't even die at the end. They got away with it! Now, I don't mind films that break away from the conventional. I understand there doesn't have to be a ""nice"" character in a serial killer film, but there should be some shades of gray. I think of John McNaughtons ""Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer"" as an excellent example of a serial killer film which had no ""good guys' in it, no happy ending. It just played out as a grim urban horror tale. WITH REALISTIC CHARACTERS. It was very uncomfortable to watch, but fascinating all the same.Natural Born Killers did not interest me at all. Just made my blood turn cold.",Natural Born Killers

The vast majority of movie goers who saw this movie, even if they enjoyed the experience, overlooked so much about this film.  The main and most prevailant theme in this film is the negative effect of the media on how people view events in society.  This is shown by how Mickey and Malorie are elevated to the status of hero (which they obviously should not be) by the classic scum journalist Wayne Gale.  The next theme is the love story between Mickey and Malorie.  So much time in the movie is spent on this, but it is largely overlooked.

348,GRLtech,"Tries hard, but never accomplishes anything",6,14 January 2004,"Natural Born Killers is a truly tumultuous ride, and one that quickly becomes unpleasant.  Ranging from truly offensive to mildly humorous, the film never stays in one place and never decides how best to deliver its message.  And while the visual imagery of the film is an interesting but gimmicky touch, the film never really reaches the place it wants to be.(Minor Spoilers)The film's message is clear - it is a condemnation of our society's love of violence.  To portray this message, Stone weaves a simple tale of mass murder around the gimmick of color transformations and stock horror footage. However, for all of Stone's manipulation, Mickey and Mallory Knox never become likable characters.  Whereas most films would portray the police and jail guards that imprison the Knoxes as heroes, Stone bends reality (in much the same way as many screen visuals are bent) so that the police are corrupt and the jail guards inept.  However, while the authorities themselves are inept and unlikable, the magnitude of the evil of the Knoxes does not let the audience side with them.  No matter how hard Stone tries to make the authorities and the Knoxes foils for each other, the Knoxes will not come out the better; they are the extreme base of life, and even the pathetic creatures that the authorities are still come out looking better.  And for all of the false philosophy that Mickey spouts, murder still is not cleansing, and all people do not deserve to die.  During Mickey and Mallory's escape from jail, I was rooting for the police to shoot the Knoxes dead, even if it meant the loss of a hostage.  And that was not the emotion Stone intended.There may be almost no instances of justifiable homicide, but the 'murder' of Mickey and Mallory Knox would be one instance it was acceptable.For the film to be truly effective, the audience would have to side with the serial murderers; since the message of the movie is that our society loves violence and the Knoxes represent pure violence, then we should like the Knoxes (assuming the film's premise is correct) as much as we like violence.  However we never befriend the two murderers, and even though one can argue that they are just lovers trying to live a life together, no real logic can defend these two.Stone truly fumbled with Natural Born Killers and the film never lives up to the artistic and satiric delight that it apparently wants to be. While the message of the movie is an acceptable message, the movie can not deliver the emotional impact necessary to drive this message home.  Stone apparently noticed this, and tried to fix the movie's shortcomings by using a rather visually pleasing style, however the novelty of this style quickly wears off and soon becomes annoying.  All in all, Natural Born Killers is neither the masterpiece it wants to be nor the gospel that fans believe it to be.",Natural Born Killers

Oliver Stone's pure butchery of a good screenplay written by none other than Quentin Tarantino proves to be nothing less than an excuse to jam 2 hours of somewhat entertaining into a box and make 15 dollars. It has the makings of a good movie, but right when you expect it to convey some sort of message, it just flips back to the mindless Rob Zombie-esquire garbage that this country is so used to. The movie has a good concept, it just fails to back it up, and leaves the end open for a sequel.

But the Book was great too and I know that Tarantino wasn't too happy about Stone's version. If they filmed it like it was written in the book, it would probably be censored anyway. Thank god there are still some movie makers that dare to make more violent and graphic movies. I miss movies like The Bad Luitenant, True Romance, Pulp Fiction...They exist, but not enough if you ask me. What I also liked in this movie, was that Juliette's character Mallory was just as bad and a murderer too, just like Micky, but she also had a good spirit.

357,docrog-2,Mesmerizing,9,9 August 1999,"Being in my early 50's (mid 40's when NBK was released) I find it fascinating to read the disparity among the personal reviews of this movie. It is well within the top 10 of my favorite movies for many of the reasons mentioned in others' reviews.  Seeing it in the movie theater was an experience similar to very few films in my life (""Deliverance"" and the first 1/2 of ""Silence of the Lambs"") in which the pace and tension COMMANDED my attention, immersing me totally in the director's point of view.  I felt that (to steal an expression from Mary Hartman) ""giant eagles were beating in my chest"" throughout the entire length of NBK.  But this film also had the scope of social commentary which, for me, placed the overall experience not too far removed from the #1 film in my lifetime: ""Godfather 1"", in which we witness how the perverted values of an insular family unit feeds off of AND corrupts ""normal"" society.  I cannot remember such a well made film that was totally ignored at Oscar time (although I doubt that Oliver Stone needs Hollywood's public approval), where at least the principals should have been given kudos, while far more inferior films (including, for me, that great waste of time ""Pulp Fiction"") were heaped with honors.  While not an Oliver Stone groupie (I much preferred ""Full Metal Jacket"" over its contemporary ""Platoon""), I just don't understand the vilification of much of this director's body of work.  NBK seems to be among the most controversial films of the 90's, and for that we must acknowledge that Oliver Stone accomplished what he sought to do: stimulating adult conversation by forcing us to confront the malevolence and glorification of the outrageous that permeates our ""honorable"" society.",Natural Born Killers
358,steve-33,Not bad for a film about killing.,9,25 January 1999,"Yesterday I watched Cronenburg's ""Crash"", and for all those that want to slate a film for inappropriate violence then watch that.  Natural Born Killers was my favourite film of the week.  Personally I thought that none of the characters emerged as heroes and I ended up wishing that many of the characters should not have been born in the first place.  It didn't really matter what the final outcome was or who was dead or alive, as all the ""sides"" involved were screwed up to the core.  The weird images and angles and colours worked pretty well in my opinion to enhance the psychotic nature of the main two characters, made the whole thing visually captivating.  The Aussie reporter was a bit over the top, as were some of the other characters, but perhaps this just enforced the stance of the film as a satirical reflection on a messed up society spawning messed up people at all levels...including people who voice their opinions on movies.",Natural Born Killers
359,cgaros,one of my favorite movies,10,27 July 1999,"a lot of people complain about the excessive violence and/or meaninglessness in this movie.  these people don't get it...both were goals that oliver stone set out towards for the sake of making a statement about them.  as mickey says, ""killing people like you is making a statement.  im not sure what it's saying, but...""  thats sums up the movie for me.  its making a statement, but im not sure what it is.  this is not because im stupid or oliver stone is a bad moviemaker.  its because the movie is supposed to be senseless.  i was really impressed by a bunch of scenes in the movie, particularly the scene with the old indian guy and the scene where mickey goes crazy on the guards after the jail starts rioting.  watching mickey and mallory meet the indian, i was hoping that they would spare him, so that i could justify my rooting for them.  i liked mickey and mallory, even though they were bastards. i thought that maybe that one time they could just meet someone, talk to them, and part amicably. of course, if that had happened it would have been too easy; mickey had to kill him.  in the other scene, i just liked it on a visceral level...i knew that mickey and mallory couldn't stay in jail, so my anticipation was building, and then ""bombtrack"" started up and mickey started killing people! yeah!  i know its screwed up to like violence, and that one of the things oliver stone is trying to point out is that we like violence too much, but that was awesome.  i also liked the soundtrack and all the supporting actors, esp. the guy who played scagnetti, the NIN stuff, and dan zanes.  BTW, if anyone can explain to me what the heck dan zanes is doing in this movie or give me a copy of the song/tell me where i can get one, it would be much appreciated; he was born in the same town as me, he's friends with my dad, ive met him and i like his music a lot!",Natural Born Killers

I recorded it on video and seen it at least 20 times since. Every time I review it I discover something new; I am still amazed by the performance of Oliver Stone, definitely, next to Tarantino, the best director in the world.I just can't say anything more. It's great. Everything about it. The satire to the media and the way the media reflects stuff like this, about murderers (especially the sitcom satire). The way Harrelson and Lewis acted. The way the camera keeps moving, and the way the movie is edited. The permanent change of colour and black/white. Perfect.I will always watch NBK with a lot of pleasure and I will always consider it the best movie ever made.",Natural Born Killers
363,tanec9,Probably the best movie ever made,10,9 May 2000,"I have seen NBK a year ago, knowing that it's violent and contested by many critics. But I loved it. I loved it so much that I bought the video tape one day later. And I watched it at least 20 times since, and I still haven't had enough of it. Since the beginning I was totally amazed by Oliver Stone. The alternance of color and black/white, the always moving cameras, the angles of filming: super! A feast for the eye and for the mind. Itþs the movie with the maniest symbols I've ever seen. I had to re-watch it five times to see everything Stone wanted to say. Even then, there were all kinds of elements, in the background, that I missed. It's a big performance by a movie to be ""on fashion"" for so long. Six years from its premiere, but still people are talking about it, outraged or fascinated. I think there are two kinds of people in the world, that have seen NBK. Those who loved it and consider it a top movie, one of the greatest ever made (including me), and those who were very shocked by the courage and the performances of Stone, people who are, and will always be, outraged and surprised(negatively) by the movie. Of course, it's violent. But it has an ""R"", right? So what's the problem? If you don't like violence on the TV screen, don't watch the movie. Watch outside, on the window. You'll see a world twice as violent as in NBK. After all, Harrelson sais, at one point, ""love beats the demon"", right? Anyway, therefore, it's great. It's a feast for the eye and for the mind, a movie that you can't miss. It's a crime not to see it. I loved it, and I'll always love it, no matter what anyone sais. After all, ""shit, man, I'm a natural born killer!"". Rating: 10 (out of 10).",Natural Born Killers
364,conorguiney,The Rebels Without A Clue,5,12 May 2006,"Olver Stone's Natural Born Killers was certainly a different change of mood and style for what he is more famously known for, Stone's NBK fails to be appealing apart from the hypnotizing colors, camera angles and uncensored violence, but aside all that it hasn't got much of an interesting story line. Written by Quentin Tarantino i was expecting good things, but after Stone got through dissecting the original script i was totally disappointed. I had read the original Tarantino script after i had watched it and i kinda think Stone should have stuck to his guns and maybe this movie might have been worth something. Another thing is that Stone shows us how experienced he is in the art of film-making, NBK has been labeled as the biggest experimental student film ever made, Stone used 18 different camera formats, from 8,16,35 mm cameras, black and white, Super-8 tape etc. Another unique quality this movie has is the enormous amount of cuts (the editors and negative cutters had to cut between 500-3000 negative images, which is the biggest project ever undertaken by optical house), i have to admit it's nothing short of being visually spectacular. A lot of people say this movie glorifies murder and vile acts of mindless destruction, and i have to say i am one of those people, Stones NBK script involves the cold-blooded killing of 50 people who are totally innocent, and only when the mysterious Indian ""Shamen"" gets killed are we meant to feel sympathy. Stone's blood soaked Natural Born Killers is the ultimate renegade movie, this is a movie you love to hate.",Natural Born Killers
365,msennel1,Read the tag-line.,10,26 June 2006,"Natural Born Killers is one of those movies whose true point gets often missed by its rough exterior. As violent as it is and as trippy as the camera-work is, the very last scene explains the whole point of the movie quite clearly, turning a two-hour psychedelic killing-spree into a shot at the media and how they will go so low as to glorify and exploit acts of horrific violence to make a buck. This is not a spoiler; the tag-line under the title basically says what I just did.This is one that either gets loved or hated, and, more often than not, the people who hate this movie generally miss the point (as explained above). Watch it in its entirety and watch it with an open mind (but perhaps put your five-year-old to bed first), and make sure you realize that the violence is INTENTIONALLY gratuitous (i.e. if you asked Stone if the violence was gratuitous he'd probably say ""yes"").Anyways, excellent movie.

Tom sizemore plays the insane cop who strangles prostitutes for a living.To me the best character is Dwight Mclusky played by Tommy lee Jones hes is the warden of the prison he is hilarious alright hes cleary insane and Tommy lee plays him brilliantly with the odd hairdo.In the second hour it veres from violence to comedy with hilarious support from Tommy Lee and Robert Downey jr.Itsa brilliant film well made a satire with a twist  and withQuentin Tarantino doing the story and script its bloody brilliant.Not Oliver Stones best film but one one of his best.A classic and very Contoversial.",Natural Born Killers

Woody Harrelson really can get into character for a crazy killer/sex fiend and the accent is done very well, Juliette Lewis is a great actress, she plays roles well, her character went from being dull to full of life and kicking ass and taking names all while maintaining sexy.

368,CallaWolf,"In the media circus of life, THEY were the main attraction",9,24 February 2010,"Natural Born Killers is a film that has created controversy. It was accused of praising and instigating violence, hatred, and almost every negative emotion one can feel. It was accused of being the film many people based their murders on just because ""people saw it so much it drove them to murder."" Does the film have graphic violence? Yes. Does the film have some rather frighting feelings to it? Yes. Was the film made in order to praise violence? Absolutely NOT.As Roger Ebert said in a review, this film requires two viewings: the first for it's initial impact and the second for it's actual meaning. I couldn't agree more. Of course you're not going to get the full message of the film, only if you take the film for face value. That's the point of this film, you're not supposed to take it for face value. There are some parts of the film that adds to the over the top nature to TELL you you're not supposed to take it serious (i.e. the laugh track during the scene where we first meet Mallory's family, the weird cartoons written in throughout the film, or the scene filled with sexual innuendos between the cop and Mallory towards the end), but some would seem to miss it.In this film, almost everyone can be seen as a bad guy, from the two serial killers, to the cop who only cares for fame, who eventually hires and kills a prostitute in cold blood after sex; to the sadistic prison warden who takes his job WAY to seriously. This shows that even those who are meant to serve and protect can be just as bad as the killers, only difference is one has a badge and a gun, the others just have a gun. I'm not slamming police, but the film states that there could be a bad side to things, even those that are meant to protect.The film is one that satirically represents a culture that gives high ratings to killers and the reporters giving these killers fame. Wayne Gale, played by Robert Downey Jr., is an obvious play on Geraldo Rivera, one of the most infamous reporters out there. This film is a great portrayal of the rise to fame through violent acts. It's a dark film, but also a thought provoking film.",Natural Born Killers

First of all, the chemistry between Woody Harrelson (Mickie) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) is absolutely wonderful. Generally, the casting is exceptional because we see very talented actors such as Robert Downey Jr.(at this time he was a very promising actor) and Tomy lee Jones. The scenario is very well written and it's from Quentin Tarantino and the director is Oliver Stone. This is not a movie for everyone. You will either love it or hate it, because it contains too much violence and excessive language and the directing is a little bit weird.Totally not suitable for children and for those who are getting offended or frightened easily.For everyone else i highly recommend it. A definitely must see",Natural Born Killers
370,Spike6363,An odd film revels in it's own strangeness,8,25 July 2003,"Natural Born Killers is the penultimate mindgame. That's all there is to it. The film follows the trail of two victims of troubled childhoods who become serial killers, Mickey and Mallory Knox. The more they kill, however, the more the world is fascinated by them. They all want to know what the two are going to do next. What fuels this obsession? Why, the media, of course.In one of the most disturbing scenes in the movie, we see Mallory's childhood as a sitcom, dubbed, ""I Love Mallory"". We see her incestuous father, played by a creepy Rodney Dangerfield, her mother, who does nothing, and her little brother who just sits there. This section of the film is filled with canned laughter, silly noises, and other sitcom sensibilities. It's really quite disturbing.Another way the movie satires the media in a more major way is in the character of Wayne Gale, played with a bizarre Austrailian accent by Robert Downey Jr. Gale is a man who is reporting on the killers' murderous spree, and who is getting extremely high ratings from the Knox couple. Gale goes as far as to help the killers, just because he is that greedy. He shows us that the modern day media turns mass murderors into a sport of sorts.
Another dispicible character after Mickey and Mallory is a cop named Jack Scagnetti, played by Tom Sizemore. Scagnetti is the most egotisical character I have ever seen in any work of fiction. He even wrote an autobiography, titled appropriately, Scagnetti on Scagnetti. He also killed a hooker. Want to know why? Just because he could.Yet another opposing character is the warden of the jail, Tommy Lee Jones in a psychoticly interesting role. He plays the sadistic warden of the jail Mickey and Mallory go to when they are caught. Another horrible person...Oliver Stone directed this visual tour-de-force with a style unlike anything I've ever seen. It's like you're in the killers' mind, seeing everything differently. We see visions of the devil covered in blood, Mickey also covered in blood, TV signals projected onto windows, and the ability to see things as if we are on an LSD trip. Also, the film uses no less than an astounding 18 film formats. This includes animation, 16 mm, 35 mm, color, black and white, grainy film, clean film, and more. This is mixed with a very quick way of cutting. This film uses over 2,000 cuts. Most films use 600-700. That should tell you something.Natural Born Killers is one of the most disturbing films ever made. Not everyone will understand it's satirical message, and focus only on the ultra-violence of it. Some will have to see it multiple times in order to understand it's message. However, it's a great film because it challenges out society, our ideals. It will make you think. It's worth watching, but only to those who can handle it's extremity.",Natural Born Killers

Striking with fear and attracting because of our personal monster which is inside us. We are all ""Naturally Born"" to kill but refrain our monstrous killer from actions. The most outstanding feature of the film for me was the tale of old Indian about a snake and a woman. The wisest and awful fable I've ever seen.Brilliant experiments with Anime and TV soap-opera gets the aim.  It gives strange sense of anxiety which almost always proves the quality of the movie. Thanks to Robert Richardson and all Visual Effects crew. One thing depresses - the film is too dragged out in time, you feel it while watching the prison events.Of course, I'd like to mark the wonderful play of Woody Harrelson, Robert Downey Jr. and especially Tommy Lee Jones.Leonard Cohen's music is great!",Natural Born Killers
372,svet14,A crime against humanity and the result of several copycat crimes.,1,1 June 2012,"I recently got to watch this film due to my class study of the violence and crime in films and their impact of society, with this film being the result of several copycat crimes. Even though i got to watch it for free i still feel ripped of about it. It is a utter and complete piece of trash and a total time waster, which by the end of it i was so mad i lost my temper (and sanity) and ended up punching out the poor fellow who recommended this to me. I have seen several Tarantino and Stone films and none of them is worse than this. The story starts with Mal and Mickey, 2 loony physco's who start shooting people in a cafe after the police officer flirts with Mal and is beaten the sh*t out of by Mal, with her bare hands and feet (yes a woman) who looks more like a ""Broomstick"" (as her father calls her). Right from there i knew this was one of those films i was not going to like and i wish i had just stopped the DVD right there.As the story goes further random people, thoughts and images are flying about on screen alongside the current day image which not only makes you lose interest in the story and only wonder what the f*ck is happening. The director repeats this several times which is rather annoying and no doubt this was picked up from Tarantino.Afterwards during the prison riots (the most annoying part) they escape from help with Wayne (News reporter) who's friends and crew are all shot dead by Mickey. Just before the escape about 10 to 15 armed to the teeth officers are shot and killed at once by an injured Mickey and Malorie and the news reporter who's never held a gun before. The escape so easily despite being surrounded by dozens of armed officers who cant shoot because they care about the stupid news reporter (they think he's an innocent hostage) who in the end goes crazy and is eventually killed by Mickey.During the credits they are shown still on the run (Yup two of the most notorious widely known murders who killed over 50 innocent civilians and sh*t loads of police officers are never captured) and to make sure it had the worst ending ever the director even threw in two of their kids (who presumably must have been born on the road somewhere or in the back of their car and the surgery was performed by Mickey).One thing i didn't and wont ever understand is that was the audience supposed to like these two maniacs??. Well if yeah then i can totally see where the violence comes from in today's society and can definitely blame it on films like these. 1/10.. Sorry it couldn't get any lower.",Natural Born Killers

I do think that the acting and the cinematography can be great at times, but this movie is best described as a colossal mess and it could have been something great. The choice of making a lot of the early shots in the movie feel like they're a dream, or some type of silly movie/tv show just feel pretentious and were clearly just easy to make. Granted I did enjoy that half of the movie because I liked the goofiness of it. The second half tried too hard to be edgy, and the movie started to even make less sense.

Natural Born Killers is shot very well. There are many very well done, cinematic shots that are worthy of recognition. The screenplay is spectacular. It tells the story of two youngsters who run away from home and go on a killing spree, and the problems and struggles that they encounter. This screenplay packs action, drama, emotion, and comedy into one brilliant piece of literature. This movie may be violent, but the violent is necessary. It is a movie about a killing spree, so you can't expect it not to be a little violent. Lastly, the acting in this movie was very well done. All the actors do a very good job expressing emotions through speech and action.

379,harpua,One of my all-time favorites...,10,28 December 1998,"I'm not going to get into why I disagree with all the others who have posted and said this movie was horrible, worst-ever, pointless, etc.  You are entitled to your opinions, and you can stick to watching the Titanics and the Armageddons and the such, and continue to encourage Hollywood to churn out more and more mindless cinema.I, on the other hand, enjoy watching filmmakers dare to turn out something different, and that is what Stone has presented with Natural Born Killers. I admire Stone because he has balls - he dares to push the envelope.The intent of this film, I believe, is to illustrate the phenomenon of celebrity-status.  Who really makes someone popular?  The media, the public, or the celebrity themselves.  Who is the public willing to embrace and raise to the level of hero-status?  And who is responsible for the end result? These are questions the viewer should be asking while watching this movie.As for the performances, Harrelson is brilliant as Mickey.  I can't really imagine anyone else doing the part.  I've never been a huge fan of Juliette Lewis, and NBK did not do much to change my opinion (although her scene in the jail cell with Scagnetti is very good).  The rest of the cast is superb with the exception of Tommy Lee Jones as the warden.  Typical example of how overacting can ruin a performance.While I don't expect to change anyone's opinion out there with this review, I just want for those of you who disparage this film to look beyond the supposed ""bad"" message it portrays (although in my opinion, to quote Mickey Knox, ""I know some people that deserve to die"") and look at the the deeper meaning of it.  We live in a media-fueled society, and the public in general is willing to idolize just about anybody, no matter what their accomplishments are.",Natural Born Killers
380,*Fiesta*,The most provocative movie I've ever seen,8,25 June 2000,"It's amazing how passionate some IMDB reviewers get about the content of this movie -- they either love it or hate it.  The truth is, this is not a movie you should either love or hate, but one that should make you reflect on the times that we live in.  Loving this movie is buying into all the crap that this movie makes a statement against, and hating it is essentially denying the issues that it brings up.This movie made me violent for a short time, and I think that's because, as a child of the 80's, I grew up socialized by TV.  The comment that you need to remind yourself of where you are and who you are after seeing this film is right on the money.I've never seen a movie, maybe except for Apocalypse Now, as provocative as Natural Born Killers.

Turn off your brain and enjoy the ride.I don't think the film has much of a profound message; others (Stone included) might point out the cynical and somewhat self-referential swipe at the media's portrayal of violence. Don't be fooled by this: in a truly self-referential twist, the film becomes nothing more than a glorious piece of superficial eye-candy.For those who actually _do_ find the plot profound, I would heartily recommend ""Badlands"" - a deeper, more elegant film by a long chalk.",Natural Born Killers

A friend of mine asked me to go with him to see this and I had no idea what this movie was about etc... This is by far the most pretentious drivel every to receive a large budget.  I really like a movie that has a message, but Stone insults the viewer's intelligence by taking a theme and making it into some sort of public service announcement you'd switch off in disgust if it came on during Monday Night Football. He does the same thing with every other aspect of this movie.  A good example of sewing socks with a pile driver.

384,uncmick,That roller coaster ride that you just love to do over and over again...,10,8 February 2004,"What a wonderful film.  The message (how our cultural love affair with violence fuels the media depiction of violence), the unique techniques used to convey the message (Mallory's abusive upbringing as a sitcom), and the fascinating (and yes, music video-type) editing are all first rate.  Why then is this movie hated by so many? I think there may be two main reasons: First, many people are quite regimented and conservative.  They expect life to proceed in a predictable and orderly manner.   Two follows one and three follows two.  End of story.  If not, these people get very anxious, and anxiety breeds contempt.  In NBK, things do not proceed in an orderly and predictable manner.  Camera angles are often extreme, color keeps alternating with black and white, the story line is oblique and symbolism is projected onto people and objects in preposterous ways.  People like those above (and you all know who you are) will NOT like this movie.  Secondly, there are those that live for the destination and those who enjoy the ride. This movie is a roller coaster; it is not the destination that is important, it is the ride.  For those that seek the destination and don't care about the ride, this movie will disappoint.  For those that keep getting back on the roller coaster over and over again(even though you know full well the destination) just for the ride - this movie is for you.",Natural Born Killers
385,theaustin,Unfortunate Disappointment,3,7 March 2007,"I didn't like Stone's directing in this film. The camera/editing effects were a bit much, just as the violence. I understand what he was trying to say, and I agree, glorifying violence is a problem in our society, but it was just too much.It's like when you first learn how to use editing effects, you want to use them on everything. But you soon grow to understand that less is more. This goes along with his use of violence also.There's a great scene in the deleted scenes where a witness (Ashley Judd) from one of the Mickey/Mallory massacres testifies in court. That scene is the best scene of the entire film. I haven't the faintest idea of why Stone cut it out of the final version. I think he should have dropped some of the other violent scenes (perhaps some of jail scenes?) and kept this in the film -and its still a violent scene, but it justifies the message Stone is trying to get across much better (when the audience in the court laughs as he mocks the victim about the killing of her brother, etc.).I was disappointed.

The plot was faultering, and left me with absolutely no satisfaction in the end.  Besides the horrible story line,two people going around killing just anyone for the heck of it, the constantly flashing demonds and bloody breasts throughout the film made it almost unbearable.  One didn't even get a sense of true love here because both of the characters cheated on each other sexually and fantasized about other people.  Not that one could ever suspect two demented psychos like these to ever have enough morality to actually be true to one another.  In the end, the two main characters are together and are horrifically spawning children to carry on their sick, twisted little worlds.

'Natural Born Killers' is a film which shocks and maybe even sickens the viewer, yet there is a point to the violence, there is a message. Woody Harrelson is perfect as a psychotic killer, you would not expect this from his appearances in films such as 'Money Train', 'White Men Can't Jump' and 'Kingpin'.

Robert Downey Jr puts in a sub-par performance with an appalling Australian accent, Juliette Lewis' blond wig manages to out-act the starlet herself, and Woody Harrelson is... well, Woody Harrelson, as he has been and will be in every movie he has ever appeared in. The story of a husband-and-wife Serial Killer team who streak across Highway 666 leaving a trail of blood and destruction behind them, Natural Born Killers attempts to handle the intricate and fascinating issue of Media glorification of violence by beating the audience over the head with a sledgehammer (or some other,less subtle instrument). The response is roughly as expected, braindead audiences don't notice the difference, but those who appreciate cinema will be offended by Stone's ineptitude and lack of grace. Don't let your braindead friends tell you otherwise, this movie is about as intelligent as Troll 2.

When I first watched this movie I couldn't stop watching it. It had me there at the edge of my seat. When you watch this movie you see the love between Mickey and Mallory some people would say who cares they where killers but if you watch the movie the love bond between them is amazing. This movie has great appeal the screen shows you things that only Mickey and Mallory feel or see. This plot of the movie is great. If you like movies that are romantic and yet action felt this is the movie for you! This movie is great This is my favorite movie I know every line of this movie.

392,sindellemorte,A film that turns us into exactly what it is speaking against,10,7 February 2010,"Natural Born Killers received a lot of flak when it came out: it was too violent, too violent, too violent. It glorified violence and murder, they said. Yeah, that was pretty much the point.Natural Born Killers accomplishes exactly what it claims the media does in our country: it glorifies serial killers. It takes two deplorable characters who deserve no sympathy whatsoever and makes them sympathetic. Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) Knox are worthless, despicable not-even-human characters and yet... weren't you rooting for them? I certainly was. And not just because I always go for the ""anti-hero."" Quentin Tarantino knows his audience well and he knows what his film is trying to say.Natural Born Killers is a film with a serious message to get across and it accomplishes it not only by portraying the media as worse than the serial killers they have elevated to beyond the point of rock stars but also by provoking the same reaction in the audience. Even as you are taken aback by the violence of M & M, you cannot help but root for them. To feel sorry for them. To sympathize with them. Tarantino makes their violent behavior not only palpable but understandable, even forgivable. It is all too easy to forget that these are two people who kill other people for essentially no reason. In fact, the only victims who are killed for any reason at all are Mallory's disgusting, loathsome father (played BRILLIANTLY by Rodney Dangerfield) and her limp dishrag of a mother (played wonderfully by Edie McClurg). No real reason is given for any of the other killings, of which there are over 50. The reason then is that they simply enjoy it. And yet, we forgive this as we watch. Natural Born Killers never becomes bogged down in violence for violence's sake as do many others in this genre. It is in fact a love story in many regards. Or at least, that is how it is intentionally portrayed. Maybe because love does indeed ""beat the demon."" It is this exact reason that we are able to sympathize with and root for M & M when they so clearly don't deserve it. It is also because the villain(s) in this movie are so clearly defined as people OTHER than M & M. Mickey and Mallory's characters are fully-developed. We are able to see where they were mistreated, abused and given reason to be ""bad."" Other characters, such as Wayne Gale (played by Robert Downey, Jr.) are not given this level of development. This is intentional and very well done. We need to understand them as humans if we are going to be able to sympathize and Tarantino accomplishes this well indeed, allowing us sympathy for M & M but none for the media faces and other ""villains"" in this picture.The one exception to this is Jack Scagnetti (played by Tom Sizemore), the detective who is M & M's nemesis in Natural Born Killers. We are given some background on Scagnetti and find that he is, in effect no better than Mickey and Mallory, yet he is a celebrated police detective and they are serial killers. This seems to be another attempt by Tarantino to expose the hypocrisy of the media and authority figures, a theme present throughout the entire film.The characters are developed and realistic, the acting superb. Oliver Stone's cinematography could not be better. The combination of Tarantino and Stone simply exploded on screen in this powerful and enigmatic piece. While the violence may be a bit much for some at first, Natural Born Killers absolutely deserves a watch. And another. And another.One of this reviewer's all-time favorite films. 10/10 stars.",Natural Born Killers
393,uihl_commish,WOW,10,29 September 2003,"Where to start?...Well, Natural Born Killers had me on the edge of my seat for the entire ride. Before watching the film I did not expect a cinematic masterpiece but that's exactly what I got.The look to NBK is like no other and is one of the main reasons it puts this film in a class of its own. There's great acting all around especially from Woody Harrelson, Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Downey Jr.Many people put this film down for its strong portray of violence but in my opinion it really isn't about that at all. Yes it is violent and yes it is bloody but the movie depicts more on how the media clings those aspects in order to get better ratings.All in all this is a great movie and is one of those 90s movies that you just have to see. 10/10.",Natural Born Killers
394,phobosromulus,Artsy-Fartsy Experimental Mess.,1,24 August 2012,"Natural Born Killers may be one of the most overrated films ever produced, and I can't let this stand.Many directors, when past their prime, venture into the surreal and bizarre world of experimental film. While I'm sure it has worked out well in some cases, this one doesn't.Any plot to speak of in this film is buried and obscured by an array of ever increasing ""experimental"" means of filmmaking. One second the movie is in black and white, the next in over saturated color, the next cuts to animation, followed by odd photo montages, most often badly shot and composed. The characters, as I clearly understand, are extremely unlikable, which I'm sure was Stone's intention, but it isn't pulled off in a good way.Harrelson is a wasted talent in this film, quite possibly the most wooden I've ever seen him. And Juliette Lewis, being Juliette Lewis, is just as crazy and obnoxious as ever. While the two are meant to be disliked, they instead come across as just really annoying, not brutal. For a more successful character in this vain, I'd rather point you out to Anton Chigurh, of the Coen's ""No Country for Old Men"".This movie doesn't even come across as violent, but rather as juvenile representation of it. And once again, all the ""unflinching"" violence is obscured by horrible excuses of ""clever"" shots and transitions.Stone, in my opinion, a barely adequate director to begin with, sets his bar even lower in this huge steaming mess of artsy-fartsy crap.",Natural Born Killers
395,vaileto,Tarantino style spoiled by Stone,5,18 January 2005,"A stupid movie about two serial killers on a killing-spree. The story is not bad but you can tell where Quentin Tarantino's style has been altered by Oliver Stone. It is shot to look like the visions of a drug-addict (a technique that succeeded in ""Fear And Loathing in Las Vegas"" but not here). In my opinion Woody Harelson is one of the worst actors in film history- in that movie he is even worse. A similar thing can be said about Juliette Lewis and Robert Downey Jr. The only good actor in ""Natural Born Killers"" is Tommy-Lee Jones, but even his performance isn't one of the best. A Tarantino fan like me can tell that Oliver Stone really wished to make a movie like ""Pulp Fiction"" or something in old Quentin style, but just didn't make it. Well, I guess some have it and some don't.",Natural Born Killers
396,kurthectic,Well directed... too well,7,7 July 2005,"The story of Mickey and Mallory Knox's killing spree remembers me of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow (though my only references are a Serge Gainsbourg's song and a Lois and Clark episode), anyway, the point is that this story, which of course might seem ""a little violent"" is not so much the main interest of the movie.When you walk out of the theater (or in my case, turn off the TV), you get the impression that all this violence was meant to shock, that's for certain, but most of all, I believe Oliver Stone used it to show his talent as a director.The problem is that it's only thing you see. At every shot, the screen changes color, the lenses are different, the quality of the picture, you go from an hallucination shot to an animated one. All this gathered seem to tell the audience ""hey look how good a director I am"". I kind of had the same feeling watching FF Coppola's Dracula (or is it Bram Stoker's ? I never got to know the real director). But when Quentin Tarantino does it, it looks better: the animated scenes in Kill Bill illustrates an entire story and does not just picture the present state of mind of the hero.As for the script, though it is told to have been modified from Tarantino's original, I find it rather interesting, especially the criticism over the TV and its permanent lust for ratings. Of course, it's a little too much emphasized but on this point, the direction is coherent with the story.Eventually, it was brave of Stone to dare shot this script because its overwhelming violence might have frightened a lot of producers. Good call on the Coca-Cola commercial though...",Natural Born Killers

This movie has got everything, love, horror, action, drama and at the same time it brings thousands of messages to you. This is a very good way of Tarantino and Stone to publish their social criticism and that is where I think the negative reviews has their sources.

398,kidsparrow-760-609079,Just 'wow',9,9 August 2013,"Fear and Loathing seems bland in comparison. If I could only watch ten DVDs for the rest of time, this would be one of them. Oliver Stone did something with NBK that I hadn't seen since (and still haven't since). Not only is it well made but the actors act (strange, I know). It truly is a visionary achievement (well, let's face it with a story from Tarantino it was never going to be simple), it's use of colour, opposing styles and iconography, throughout, make it impossible to ignore. Okay, granted it IS ridiculous but it's that special kind of ridiculous, the ""f*ck it, we're here now, might as well"" kind, and it gets me every time.I won't spoil it or give you the story: just prepare yourselves for a masterclass in true cinema. It wouldn't suit any other style, I can't imagine it being shown in any other way. Mickey and Mallory remain one of the greatest screen pairings of all time (the same to be said for Lewis and Harrelson), badder than Beatrix and Bill, cooler than Trinity and Neo. It's fast, it's vicious but it NEVER lets your eyes wander away. A gripping story throughout.But if you like your bones white and your coffee black and your tie in the centre of your suit; this isn't for you.",Natural Born Killers
399,thepukingtoad,"Smart message, rather stupid movie.",5,8 May 2007,"Now, on a purely aesthetic and shallow level, I rather like this movie. The editing is tight and fast, the shots interesting and near the end, the blood bountiful. Every actor does his or her job adequately, ranging from the near-sublime (I'm talking about you, Woody Harrelson) to the barely tolerable (That's you, Robert Downey Jr. I can say will full confidence as an Australian that you DID NOT pull the accent off.) But that's all on the basic surface level. That's not what this movie is about (supposedly). The movie is of course about how the mass media glorifies and welcomes violence, how American society reacts to violence and about the two main protagonists Mickey & Mallory and how they came to be what they are.I get it. Really, I do. The media made them heroes when they shouldn't have been. What they really needed was guidance. Well done. Move on. This movie doesn't quietly sneak its message in, or even deliver it; it POUNDS IT IN and doesn't let up. For not one second does it believe that its audience has the cranial capacity to deal with what it's saying. ""Yeah guys, this is WHAT you're doing. This is what America is doing. Look, you're doing it right now! To prove it, I'm going throw some more near-subliminal shots of devils and blood up on the screen!"" And nice little irony (which Oliver Stone found surprising) is that the movie really made its profits from the media's outrage over the amounts of violence in it. What I'm surprised by was that Stone was surprised by it. I really am quoting him here this time, not a mockery like before: ""Yes the film's violent but that's only the first step, what about the secondary, or even the tertiary?"" There is no tertiary stone. 'Natural Born Killer's' is violent and has a flat message which it yells at you. There is no third level. You just got indulgent in your first two.Another groovy little irony for those who haven't read Tarantino's original and witty screenplay is that there was a good chunk of the movie devoted to a film within the film about Mickey and Mallory that some arrogant director was making. There would have been interviews with the 'actors' stating things like ""I didn't play Mallory as a murderer. I played her as a woman in love."" It's scary how close this mockery of Hollywood films pretty much became the end product.So no, to those who would say otherwise, I don't have a problem with violence. I love cinematic violence. I'm a gore hound. And there were certainly enough close range shot-gun blasts in this movie to appease me there. I even liked its message, for the first ten minutes or so before I realized it was just getting continuously repeated ad nauseum.So dear me, this is basically a big ol' pop-corn action flick trying to have a brain. Which is simply can't do because, hey, it's meant to be a good ol' pop-corn action flick.",Natural Born Killers

401,applescruff-88131,"Excellent Film, One of My All-Time Faves!",10,17 January 2021,"First off I want to say that I cannot believe how many people apparently hated this movie, just looking through the reviews on here. To each his own, but in my opinion this is one of the best films out there. I first saw this when I was in high school, circa 1997\98, & I had never seen anything like it. It got me thinking about all kinds of issues that had never before crossed my young mind, primary of which, of course, is the f'ed up relationship between violence & media, the way that we click to stories that highlight the worst of human nature- illustrated by Mickey & Mallory's stratospheric rise to fame. Frankly, there are no parts of this film that didn't work for me. I loved it all, even the cringy scenes of Rodney Dangerfield as the world's worst father & the creepy moments detailing the detective's growing lust over Mallory. Woody Harrelson & Juliette Lewis were at the absolute tops of their game (as was Robert Downey Jr., but IMO that man shines in whatever he's in, so....). Now, all of that said, I could definitely understand why this wouldn't be some people's cup of tea. There are more than a few of the aforementioned ""cringey"" moments, & pretty much the entire subject matter of the movie is dark & ugly, bit that's kind of the point. Stone wanted us to look at the darker sides of human nature & to recognize that those elements exist in all of us. A lot of other reviews I read on here have said that they felt the movie didn't hold up on subsequent rewatching, & again, I could not disagree more. As previously mentioned, I was a teenager when I first watched NBK, but I own the DVD & have researched it regularly throughout the years. If anything, as I get older I find MORE in it to relate to & recognize additional messages that went over my head when I watched as a kid. I would recommend this film to people who like movies that push the boundaries, that think outside if the box, & who aren't easily offended, especially by gratuitous violence. And to those who didn't like it, especially if you only watched it once years ago, I say, give it another try, & try to look at it from another point of view. You might just be surprised by what you see.",Natural Born Killers
402,indiedaze,acid-fuelled highway ride to hell!,9,22 February 2006,"For those of you who haven't seen it, it tells the story of Mickey and Mallory Knox, who together embark on a murderous rampage. They soon become cult heroes because of the non-stop media coverage they receive. Their notoriety soars, and they get arrested and taken to a maximum-security prison. Media interest still surrounds them, and they finally agree to an interview with Wayne Gale, a serial killer specialist. The interview takes place live in the prison, at the same time a riot escalates in the prison around them.This is for me, the most impressive part of the film. Oliver Stone uses colour-orientated scenes to represent the emotion as well as the amount of power a character has in the scene. The main colours used are green, red, and blue, sometimes black and white for close-up shots cross-cutting to entire body shots in colour. The black and white close-ups are when the audience is supposed to take note of something important said.The prison sequence uses a wide variety of different perspectives. For example, when Mickey is being interviewed our point of view is from the camera man's angle, and then occasionally cut to the live video feed that is being reported from a news desk, then suddenly it will change to Wayne Gale's view of Mickey, all happens while we can still hear the interview going on.There are so many hidden subtexts going on in this film, that it is hard to notice them all on watching the film for the first time. Even the more obvious subtexts are intellectually stimulating. Oliver Stone clearly wants the audience to understand at least some of the film and perhaps hopes that those who choose a second viewing will begin to unravel the layers of meaning.The film puts forward the idea that everyone has their own demon inside them, and it takes a certain moment or event in a persons life to set the demon free. In the interview Mickey is trying to explain how he is an evolved soul, and accuses Wayne Gale of still being an ape as he is so spiritually slow for evolving. He is the Media. Oliver Stone uses the interview scene to portray his own opinion that these two men are demons of two kinds. He makes this point by using the interview scene instead as a critique of mass media, inter-cutting sudden shots of Wayne Gale with a pitchfork and horns, and later uses the same ""demon"" distortion effect on Gale's face as well.When the prison riot begins, more audience point of views are introduced, we see the action through security cam hooked on a wall, two or three hand-held cameras, and a whole range of different effects added on with smart editing. These include short intervals of animation, TV clips from the 1950s, video distortion and some fast cuts of a guy dancing like a Native American. These cuts are very relevant to what's going on in the film, and to what has been before in the subtext of the film.The music used in this film fits with what's happening on the screen. Oliver Stone used the current grunge bands that were around at the time such as L7, Janes Addiction and stranger choices like Leonard Cohen, Patti Smith, Patsy Cline and The Hollywood Persuaders (a side project of Frank Zappa). I would like to draw attention to the choice of music during the riot scene. What would be expected of a normal riot scene would be the average aggressive nu-metal music, but instead, Stone uses a song by Nusrat Fateh Ali Kahn, an Indian singer who focuses on expressing spiritual enlightenment. Instead of feeling out of place, the music fits perfectly into the riot sequence. He creates an energetic, tribal, back-to- roots type feeling that just accelerates the emotion of the moment. The rest of the film is very much the same, mixing slow grunge music in the magically acid-fuelled parts of the film with natural and unnatural sounds that fit the landscapes they travel through.This film is so twisted in its narrative, and fragmented into different filming techniques with the different P.O.V's that it is constantly changing its genre, and blends it so well without the audience noticing it sometimes adds two different sides to the same story being told on screen. These are moments that make it hard to decipher what is reality and fantasy. For example, when Mickey and Mallory first met, the genre of the film changes completely into a disturbed, grotesque version of a 1950's family sitcom. This is tied in with many debates had over the years on what makes a murderer, whether it is biological and tied in with the family, or whether it is Stone's point of the film, that it's the media that makes the killer. The 1950's sitcom sketch may just be seen from Mallory's perspective, thus distorting the truth as well as narrative on what really happened when they met.",Natural Born Killers

411,peeweesex,"Stone, Rutowski and Veloz's Work, not Tarantino's",10,22 June 2002,"This movie is great, it's a work of art, beautiful editing, excellent soundtrack, innovative cinematography, and a great society theme that tackles almost every subject about the United States society. I won't continue praising this movie since I think it's unnecessary, however I've heard people say that this movie is good thanks to Tarantino who wrote the original script. Well this is totally untrue, the original script is totally different from the output.First of all, let's start with the basic difference: Tarantino's script would output a movie which would tackle the subject of the way media glorifies the violence, the subject of the corruption in the prison managing, and an action movie with dialogue being the main source of entertainment, just as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.Stone's script instead, tackles not only those issues, but it also attacks the way movies glorify violence, it's a satire about violence used as entertainment in movies. Remember in the intro sequence when Mickey throws the knife and it plunges into the cowboy's back. In a typical movie, the audience reaction to someone throwing a knife, breaking a window, and reaching someone would be something like ""cool"", therefore Stone mocks about it and shoots it so that the camera follows the knife flying and we hear beautiful opera music, making fun of the ""how beautiful, a knife plunging into someone, cool"" feeling that normally joins a sequence like this in movies. Or he shoots Scagnetti's murder of an innocent prostitute with ""football game"" music to tackle the way the audience would normally feel entertained by this kind of scene.Now, if you analyze carefully, the kind of movie that Stone attacks is exactly the kind of movie that Tarantino makes. All those ironic scenes that NBK show us were supposed to be serious scenes according to the original script. Then that would be the reason why Tarantino is mad at Stone, because he made fun of his script, at the same time, that would be why Tarantino denies any connection with the film, because the output is totally different from the one he planned in all aspects. Therefore, one could say that the only contribution that Tarantino made to the movie was to sacrifice one of his scripts by giving it to Stone and letting him use it to make a satire of. Now let's go into cinematography:1. Remember those long, steady shots of Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta walking through the hallways of a building, compare them to the rapid cutting with black and white, slow motion and abnormal juxtaposition of images of NBK.2. The dialogue between Scagnetti and McClusky in the prison corridors would have been very much alike in terms of cinematography to the one of Travolta and Jackson.3. The interview between Gale and Mickey would have looked like Mia Wallace's date with Vincent Vega.4. The ironic and confusing mexican standoff with Mickey and Scagnetti would have looked like the still mexican standoff in Reservoir Dogs with Harvey Keitel.5. The intro sequence of NBK would have lost its loud music, its tilted angles, it's black and white shots, and would have looked like the final breakfast scene in Pulp Fiction. Etc.Now, back into the themes showed in NBK, the movie also attacks the society by exposing characters like Wayne Gale, totally egocentric and thirsty of power and fame; Jack Scagnetti, the real portrait of famous cops who are really detestable people and just care about themselves; Dwight McClusky, a corrupt prison warden that enjoys the suffering of the prisoners and uses the concept of  justice and law to excuse his attitude.Unlike Tarantino's script, Stone's script focuses on the attack on the United States society, and believe it or not, it's a movie about values, because it's about the lack of values that the society has. It's also an action movie, no doubt about it, but everything has a more profound meaning that attacks the society, the sitcom of  `I love Mallory' which satirizes the audience's desire of seeing suffering, the happy music heard in violent scenes, the Coca-Cola polar bears providing a fake feeling of safety, the Drug Zone showing the culmination of technology unsuccessfully trying to give happiness to people (remember those signs like `sexual tension' written in the walls of the store), etc Tarantino's script has a profound meaning also, but it keeps using violence and funny dialogue as entertainment.",Natural Born Killers

Simply said. This movie has achieved what many films fall short to even coming close to accomplish; they are able to contrast. OK now your saying ""big whoop"", but this film does it subtly, blatantly, but the point is that within every frame there is contrast between the good and evil to the point where you are questioning what is good and what is evil. It's nothing short of genius. On top of that this film amazes me with it's smart and sarcastic comments on society. Whats also great about the film is it in it's entirety is pronouncing itself as an entity to which is commenting on.

The film delivers on that theme with expert precision, but other than that, the film is a technical nightmare. The cinematography doesn't have any clear vision, and is essentially a bunch of random styles meshed together to make a pile of nonsensical crap. The acting is absolutely unbearable in some scenes. If you are excited about seeing Rodney Dangerfield in this movie, don't be, because his character is one of the worst I have ever seen and carries no weight on the plot of the film whatsoever. Juliette Lewis is once again horrible and is even more unbearable in this film than her recent installments. Woody Harrelson does the best job in the film, but his character is extremely underused and is horribly utilized in the context of the film. The last thirty minutes is where the brakes really come off and the film just careens out of control, completely losing itself in character motivations and a need to go out with a bang, the film loses all interest in most viewers at this point.I don't recommend this film, especially to Oliver Stone fans.

This was an important film because of its stylistic avant-garde approach which has been copied several times by such great films as Run Lola Run and Darren Aronofskies masterful Pi and Requeim for a Dream.

The characters were purposefully over the top and there was very little character development. Also, most of the feats pulled off by the main characters(Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis) are nearly impossible. I realize that the director, Oliver Stone, was making a point about society's growing immunity to emotions caused by violence, but it makes a really bad movie. Leave the political statements out of films and stick to making classic movies. I gave this movie 2 out of 10 stars. The only highlight of the movie is a scene where you hear some personal beliefs of Harrelson and get some insight on his philosophy.

423,bleedingfart,A poor attempt at satire,3,24 September 2005,"I'm simply going to say that this movie was poor and it seems like it was made to reach the obtuse. The massive number of reviews which praise it provide much better satire than this film ever does. Not only was it lacking in any kind of subtlety or cleverness, it was way over the top to the point of stupidity at times. I can stomach violence, even extreme violence in some great movies, but in this case it was simply disturbing with no redeeming qualities.What little message there was in this movie was spoon-fed to the point where I felt insulted. Does Stone think we are total numbskulls? Oli, we can link together that her dad's violence against her lead to her own violent actions without being reminded every single time by superimposing images of her violent dad. If there's satire in here, it's about as subtle as a barium enema.And the TV fad interviews where kids think Mickey and Mallory are cool - retarded. I can't think of a better way to word it. Way over the top. That scene alone destroyed any credibility the movie might have had. Was Stone really implying that your average teenager thinks serial killers are cool? Does he truly feel that because of violence in media, your average teenager is so devoid of morality that they'd celebrate two ruthless killers?I'm sorry I watched it. It is a perfect example of a powerful execution of a fuzzy idea. Stone force-feeds the audience a vague message wrapped in style and steeped in the ridiculous. It reeks of self-importance, killing its own potential for satire or comedy.

424,Jeunes,Better than Brilliant?,10,10 May 2006,"I wouldn't fault Posthuman's review except he unfortunately did not have the space to go into even more detail to demonstrate the artistic complexity of the NBK film. I want to add just one item to illustrate that multi-layered satirical commentary: Mallory's early family life as portrayed with Rodney Dangerfield as her dad. It's virtually impossible to miss the TV serialization of her mythic youth in the ""Married With Family"" format artfully twisted to parody that TV series which is a parody of U.S. family life on its own. Who or what is presenting this dysfunctional U.S. family with its canned audience laughter in the background? Who or what created this ""family history"" of sexual, physical and psychological abuse that is supposed to explain the ""why"" of Mallory's self-centered life? Why is the audience laughing at this horror show? As Posthuman said, because the U.S. mainstream can't see its own degenerative condition. Daddy fondling and pimping his own 14 or 15 year old daughter is funny to the now documented obese and overweight generation of TV addicts who respond to audience prompts, not to reality. INMHO, this family vignette in NBK is a microcosm of the film's total satiric and bitter evaluation of the great U.S. film and TV addicted audience.

Unless you're into EXTREME violence I would NOT recommend this movie. I'm not a huge Oliver Stone fan, but do have to concede that he is one of the best in his ""genre"". He is great at exposing the ugly, visceral, raw side of life (Born on the 4th of July, Platoon). In this movie he was obviously exposing the sensationalism of the ""outlaw"" and the rebels by American media. This being said I also think the movie takes stereotypes and grinds them into the ground. The scenes with Mallory's father (Rodney Dangerfield) were hard to watch for anyone who has a sliver of conscience. It would be interesting to know if Dangerfield actually wanted to be in this movie or if he simply needed the money.

A very poor film.,2,30 March 2007,"While this film tries to provide a critique of the media's glamorisation of violence and crime, it instead quickly becomes just another example of it. Without a real plot and more of a drive to point the finger, I was disappointed as to how it all turned out. I couldn't help but feel that I was supposed to be rooting for Mickey and Mallory as though they were anti heroes and the only bad guys were the media and those who incarcerated them. Awash with a quite frankly obscene amount of increasingly horrifying violence and emotionless cruelty it is of little surprise and somewhat ironic that serial killers, such as those who carried out the Columbine massacre, were inspired by the events in this film. Had the film instead concentrated on the pain and suffering caused by these random acts of violence and the lack of empathy from the media towards Mickey and Mallory's victims, the message might have been delivered as intended. Instead it seems to be given a back seat to the gratuity of the murders committed by the two main characters. Anyone who has a reasonable amount of intelligence doesn't need a film like this to explain to them the responsibility that film, TV and media industry as a whole have in the violence that some members of society feel compelled to commit and its message will be lost on those it should actually be speaking to who won't be able to understand the point Oliver Stone is actually trying to get across.",Natural Born Killers
430,abramz86,WOW Oliver Stone at his best,10,22 September 2005,"This is one of my all time favorites. It's a dark tale about two serial killer love birds (Mickey and Mallory Knox) on the run from the law on a murderous rampage. I first saw this movie at a friends house and I had never heard of it before, in the first ten minutes I was in awe. Later I found out that it had a massive cult following- no wonder, it's brilliant!! Mallory is molested as a child, and both Mickey and Mallory have had violence in their lives always, so of course they become serial killers. I was rooting for them all the way as they carved out their trail of terror into route 666. Has some dark commentaries about society involving the media and American family life and other issues. Woody plays of the part of the psychotic gun wielding criminal very well. It is angry and anarchistic. The scenes with Robert Downey Jr. (he plays a media whore Geraldo Rivera type character who hosts the show ""American Serial Killers"" or something like that) and the whole media aspect of the movie I like because they are the truest. The first ten minutes though are by far the best part of the movie just because of all the awesome visuals and camera shots!!! The visuals are a bit much at times, but they also make the movie. I'd say when you watch it, don't expect anything just sit back and enjoy.

This movie is filled with chaotic shots and angles, fast cuts, handheld and shaky cameras, psychedelic scenery and just insane visuals. The moral of the story focuses on how media creates stars out of the deranged and begs the question: who is a better being? the media or the criminals? It kind of reminds me, in a way, of what ""A Clockwork Orange"" asks us, the viewers. We have the criminal couple juxtaposed with the media people, inviting us into analyzing the traits that make both parties ""horrible"" and ""evil"", but the Knox's evil regards the cold blooded killing, whereas the media's evil regards the control over the population, feeding us lies and establishing zombiedom. Now, the main concerns that a lot of people have regarding this jewel are that ""the production and filming are too blurry and shaky and fast paced"", that Oliver Stone paints the same picture and asks the same question again and again throughout the movie and that it's just impossible to watch and too obnoxious. In my opinion, the production and the chaos of the movie are perfect in telling this story through the lens of the killers and through the lens of the masses. Everything is filled with adrenaline and I think that suits the movie really well, we are witnessing the madness live, unedited and raw, just like the husband/wife pair and the masses through the perspective of the media. And the thing with Oliver Stone's message being to obnoxiously thrown at the viewers, this movie does not consider itself mysterious in any way: it's not ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""The Holy Mountain"" or ""Inception"", the message it's in your face, just like the couple and the media.

So to all the people who missed it, I would suggest watching it again and watch carefully for the shadowy figure who keeps watching Mickey and Mallory at various points through the film. Oliver Stone even filmed an alternative ending to the film, that showed him killing Mickey and Mallory with a shotgun.The person to watch for appears in the first major scene in the diner, he is reading a newspaper, notice that although in the film they habitually kill everyone except for the one obligatory witness, he just vanishes. He appears at different points in the film. He pops up in the prison and shows them a way out, but promptly vanishes again. In Stones alternative ending he is in the van with Mickey and Mallory and suggests that he take Mallory for a test ride, then kills both of them at point blank range with a shotgun.

444,stephe-67897,Unhinged genius with a missed message for the future.,9,19 September 2019,"Natural Born Killers is an out of this world love story at heart. It has been two decades since I last saw this film. I took a trip down memory lane to relive the 90's cult classics. This star-studded cast performance is not for the faint at heart. This wacky tale of love enduring through all, is an unhinged version of the movie Desperado. Natural Born Killers gives an over the top approach to most action films being a love story at heart. The film also hits several topics of the post-OJ Simpson trail area. Chief among them are the celebrity like appeal our culture form around barbaric individuals like Ted Buddy and Charles Mansion.
About the story: The film follows Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) two mass murders madly in love with one another. A chance encounter Mickey called fate gave Mallory a way out from her sexually abusive father's claws. The first victims were personal after that it was anyone who crossed their path came face to face with the reaper. As their killing spree grow so did the couple's fame, this modern-day Bonnie and Clyde had fans all over the world. However, this also brought in Detective Jack Scagnetti (Tom Sizemore) a monster in his own right tasked with apprehending Mickey and Mallory. After several twists and turns, the legendary couple is captured. However, that is just the start of the tale of Mickey and Mallory, not the end.
The cinematography and visual design set this film apart from anything director Oliver Stone has ever done. The use of chaotic and unfocused scene spliced throughout the film gave a great insist into the unhinged mind of Mickey and Mallory as the demon of their upbringing torments them. The background around Mickey and Mallory show predators that capture the couples true nature. Several scenes jump from black and white to color; everything in this film is intense from the colors to action.
However, through everything, I listed above a critical point is lost in this film. Wayne Gale's (Robert Downey Jr.), Jack Scagnetti, and Warden Dwight McClusky (Tommy Lee Jones) obsessions lead to their demise. The pursuit of fame, fortune, and higher ratings can be just as toxic as murder. The level of harm depends on how much of the morals you lose in the process.",Natural Born Killers

The characters were were played out, and you could actually see their logic even though you knew they were nuts. Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis should have gotten an award.

This move was so screwed up.Its one of the worst movies i have ever seen. Everyone else thought is was going to be good because Quentin Trantino wrote the script but Oliver Stone changed it and turned it into rubbish. Natural born killers is rubbish and the violence in it was lame. This movie sucks. If you want waste your money on useless junk then waste it by seeing this lame movie. This movie was also poorly filmed. It is sad to think that some people out there actually think this movie is good. Iam a big fan of violent movies and this one disappointing.,Natural Born Killers

Kill Bill) You will find the same cartoon sequences, over exaggerated violence and black and white sequences. These are almost identical to those in ""Natural Born Killers"". Obviously this film taught him a lot. So before you degrade a film, pick good arguments, not just theories you've come up with. Oliver Stone is a master of film, and this is arguably his greatest work. It puts great emphasis on the role of violence in our society. It does this all the better because it glorifies and belittles violence at the same time, an amazing feat. This is compelling film, riddled with metaphors, that comments on our society, if only one is astute enough to see the subtleties of it construction.",Natural Born Killers

The casting is brilliant in my opinion as the actors and actress's, i feel, really capture the events and feelings in the film.I decided to do my film essay on this film as it contain so much detail and things for me to speak about in the essay.Many people i have spoken to about this film don't like it and say it's just mindless violence. I think this is rubbish and they haven't obviously gained the full perspective of what the film is trying to present and obviously don't understand Satire. I have no problem with people disliking to film but i dislike it when people comment on the film as just being mindless violence and not giving the film it's chance to show it's potential.

455,kendalledwards-67673,"Buckle up, you are in for a ride...",10,19 September 2021,"This film is the perfect mixture of romance and violence as newlyweds Mickey and Mallory Knox, played by Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis, set off on a haphazard killing spree. These characters are made for one another and they prove that true love never dies although true love can certainly kill. Imagine the 1967 film, Bonnie and Clyde laced with a concoction of sex, intoxication, and a dysfunctional upbringing that is presented to us in a helter-skelter fashion. This movie was unpredictable and was filmed with techniques that earns its place as a piece of motion picture art.Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis were convincing as both complimented the other exceptionally throughout the film. The mixture of Mallory's crazy and Mickey's rage was the perfect recipe for this beautiful disaster. Despite their psychotic nature, both characters had unconditional love for one another that was impossible to sever.Director Oliver Stone used sporadic camera angles alongside dramatic shots in various colors in order to pull the audience into Mickey and Mallory's chaotic adventure. Animated shorts of their internal demons were creatively used throughout the film and added a special flair to its style. There is a specific scene in the film where the couple arrives at a diner and Mallory begins a hypnotic dance as the camera circles around her. After luring him in, Mallory begins her attack on the unsuspecting victim that leads to tumultuous camera movements supported by encouraging sounds of rock.The music and sound effects within the film are as important and descriptive as the film's visuals. During the scene where Mickey and Mallory first meet they are in a sitcom show setting that is accompanied by soundtracks that add subjective emotions and reactions to the couple's interaction with one another. The sound effects added to the animation shorts add an intensity to the madness Mickey and Mallory are experiencing in their minds. It is an intriguing use of sound that keeps viewers yearning for more.Natural Born Killers is a worthwhile watch for viewers who enjoy an unsettling and satirical depiction of demented love as it pulls them along for the ride. With the storyline written by Quentin Tarantino and the directorial talent of Oliver Stone, this film creates a unique experience for everyone who watches it. The film's cast, which includes amazing supporting actors such as, Robert Downey Jr., Tom Sizemore, and Roger Dangerfield, added to the film's unconventionality and success. This film closes with two separate endings that I strongly advise viewers to watch since both provide different perspectives based on foreshadowed karma or inevitable fate.",Natural Born Killers
456,makefhfgoaway,Didn't live up to the hype.,1,6 November 2002,"I was told over and over again that I HAD TO see this movie, since I am a fan of movies like Pulp Fiction, etc.Huh? What movie did other people see?This movie reminded me of a bad cross between Quentin (who did write the original script) and David Lynch (who is often weird in movies, just for the sake of being weird).The film switched back and forth between color, B&W, 16mm and 8mm, not to mention animation, so often that you quickly became seasick. Worse there was no rhyme or reason to it, except to do it. I know some people like to believe there are hidden secrets behind the camera shifts or that the director is so innovative and interesting that each camera angle and format change requires in-depth analysis... but, often this is just a director bored with the script and trying to invoke something that isn't there.The basic story was interesting and inventive... two ""natural born killers"" find love through killing. The ""message"" that the media loves killers was heavy handed and far too obvious, although Robert Downey did his usual fantastic work as the Geraldo-like reporter trying to get the story on Micky and Mallory.Overall, this is a good movie for pseudo intellects to see and then sit over a cappuccino to discuss the meaning behind why the director chose to use black and white as the bullet traveled through the air.
However, for true movie fans, it is a movie worth missing",Natural Born Killers
457,BakerElement31,Unjustified Insane Violence,6,1 November 2009,"There are some parts of this movie that are well made and I won't deny that. But, I think this movie showed lots of violence without a purpose. If Oliver Stone really believes that this movie didn't promote and showed it was wrong, he is wrong. The movie ends with Woody Harrelson saying ""we are a product of our society."" This is just an excuse for showing all the brutal violence the film just showed. Not only is this line not original (already used by Charles Manson), but it is a cop-out. This message was not delivered very strongly throughout the movie and then was suddenly thrown at us at the end. Furthermore, this statement is not even true. Society as a whole is not that violent. In fact, it was this movie that made many in society more violent. The reason serial killers do become famous, is because there are so few of them. Other than this I also thought it was a major plot hole that Mickey and Mallory ended up in the same prison. That would never happen in reality. They would be kept in entirely different prisons. One compliment I would give to this film are the performances by Robert Downey Jr, Tommy Lee Jones, and Rodney Dangerfield. I think all the scenes with these actors overshadow the performances of the two main characters because of the emotion and brilliance. The opening sequence was also a very interesting way to start the film. Quentin Tarantino wrote the original script, but it was strongly re-edited by another writer. Apparently a lot of the dialogue written by Tarantino was kept, but a lot of the plot was changed. I think it really shows because the majority of the dialogue was very good, but the plot was not completely successful. Overall though, this movie did not satisfy me very much and Oliver Stone should not have an easy conscience about the consequences of this film.",Natural Born Killers

Don't you think that those murderers who kill bunch of innocent people for no reason should be burned alive? Or do you agree with all those junkies who think that mass murderers like Charlie Manson are heroes? After all, you made a very clearcut statement in all the movies you made about the Vietnam war.

459,yendorbu,"Awful, no surprise Taratino disowned it!",1,13 July 2007,"This movie could have been good. Unfortunately some one let Oliver Stone touch it. And then it begins to spiral down.Tarantino's original vision could have been executed with only the legend himself at the helm. Perhaps, even some other director could have pulled it off as the Writer intended. Oliver Stone however, turns the movie into what HE wanted, and ruined it.The film is riddled with plot holes and revealing mistakes, and usually we can enjoy a movie with such things. However, they are so grossly visible and over bearing in this film that you're constantly pulled out of the story to notice that everyone's weapons are magically reloading, and that supposed knives and razors do no damage to people. The 52 person killing spree that Micky and Mallory went on supposedly lasted only three weeks, yet law enforcement and others do not immediately recognize the antagonists despite the fact that their faces would daily be on every major news network and paper. They even check into a hotel, where their I.D.'s would have been required, or at least some other form of identification, yet there is no mention of this.The characters were poorly cast, as Mallory inspires no sympathy. Micky ditto, Woody seems very uninterested in his character and often you can imagine he's just come out of a big yawn as the scene started due to his dazed and uninvolved look. Guards, Police, and other good people are shown in an evil light, and although this is the point of the satire, it's effect is lost in the unrealistic execution. Guards gun down one of their own, yet hesitate to shoot a reporter. Officers open fire on hostages in the prison, missing the antagonists (Micky and Mallory), yet hitting nearly every hostage.Tarantion films are famous for taking surreal and unbelievable and turning it into something one can buy AND enjoy. Stone destroys this story, as per usual. See it if you must, but remember that Tarantino had nothing to do with this film after they stole his script.Not even worthy of Satire, the violence tries to shock us (With a string of films like Saw and Hostel, it's hard to be shocked by violence). This film as actually caused the death of people, showing that Oliver Stone's movies ARE so awful they do create the want to kill in some people. Perhaps after watching World Trade Center to see if it's good (I'm not holding my breath), I'll pay Mr. Stone a visit.",Natural Born Killers

Oliver Stone's vivid imagery and whiplash editing add volumes of texture to the Tarantino-penned story about the American fascination with the macabre. Stand out performances from Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis highlight the tale of Mickey and Mallory Knox, the dysfunctional children of the reagonomic me-generation who graduate from abuse-driven hopeless to mass murder.  Their anti-social behavior draws the ire of best-selling-tracker Jack Scagnetti (Played by the talented Tom Sizemore) who seeks to exact his revenge while the pair are under the watchful eye of Warden McCluskey (Tommy Lee Jones in an over the top yet brilliant performance.)

Like Billy Bob Thornton's ""Sling Blade"", if a nominal amount of violence is inherently part of the story, then the important thing is not the violence.  Like all movies, judgements should be based on criteria such as tightness of screenplay, quality of acting, focus of the director, and similar facets.  Whether the movie can be seen by your three-year old should not be important for these awards.  Three-year olds don't vote for Academy Awards!

The style, shooting and format of the film are farcical, and as such the characters and events are not believable. Consequently it is hard to be shocked or moved at all by any of the violence; when it is filmed in such an unrealistic fashion - appearing to cater for an immature audience.

First of all, I would like to say from reading a couple of the other reviews by some IDmb users, I would like to say for all those who didn't understand the film and didn't like it... Guess what, "" You to way uptight and ignorant to even understand the film"" "" Oh my god,there's so much violence and all those weird film shots "" To bad people, cause it's supposed to be like that. This movie is not exploitating violence and murder. It's simply telling all of us what a messed up world we live in, when killers like Menendez Brothers, OJ Simpson, and Charles Manson ( just to name a few from different time frames ) can become celebrities and famous, even more talked about than actualy even more than Actors or Musicians, themselves. All those people who didn't understand this film are those people who are so uptight, but haven't actually been given a Nice dose or reality yet. I have a friend who was abused and raped as a child, try putting yourself in her shoes for a minute and realized how much can you stand and put up with. Realized how much more abuse and depression can you go through just enough for that person to just go insane. There are people in our world, who are very crazy and they don't really know the difference from right and wrong, just like Mickey and Mallory......... So the reason you are seeing all these weird, creepy, and over the top film shots that are in Natural Born Killers is because you are seeing the world from Mickey and Mallory's eyes. You are seeing the world from 2 very psychotic, Serial Killers who were raped, abused, tormented, and who were taken to a very deep, dark & twisted world in which they are the only ones who live in it.... meaning that they are simply Crazy, and don't think and act like no one else in our world, because no matter how sadistic it may be; they have their own way of thinking.................. To sum it up, Natural Born Killers is an ugly, but beautiful surreal piece of art house cinema.It may have been very over the top and sadistic. But just simply look at your TV and see how fake and evil this world really is. The media and TV viewers ( puppets) make people like Mickey and Mallory famous. I really hope people be very more openminded and willing to accept a movie like this, because it's the one of the first of it's kind and very Artistic. You will never see a movie like this, except for for    ( Requiem for a Dream, EraserHead, Becoming, etc.. )Oliver Stone is a genius and a rebel.

470,s-dickerson91,short review,7,11 March 2010,"like many other people I had to watch this film more that once to get a better understanding.The two characters Mickey(Woody Herrelson)and Mallory Knox(Juliette Lewis) are a married psychopathic serial killing couple. This part was understandable from the start. What I didn't understand from the first viewing was why the camera was tilted and they would often use black in white clips in a movie that color. Then after gaining a bit of camera knowledge i decided to watch it again.(1994)Natural Born Killers, is a very weird movie. It almost seemed to me as if they were playing threw the sight of a psycho or threw the stand point of one of the killers Mickey or Mallory Knox. I also notice that that Mickey and Mallory Know both came from a corrupt childhood. This lead me to the this was fuel for them to kill.Almost the whole movie uses Dutch-angle-shots. This was very interesting to me because people don't usually record that much of a film using Dutch-angle. This really did a good job at informing you the characters are really screwed up. Then you have the black and white clip that were also dutch angle. That were unusual as-well these antics really help you get the whole feel of the movie.This is a movie you would definitely have to watch more than once because it gets confusing at times. Spoiler:example the scene were Mickey and Mallory Knox went to that Indian mans house, when they walked in they had projector like names on there shirts that said demons and other thing like answers to the little Indian boys questions. I really did not understand what was going on then when they walk out the ground it full off rattle snakes.i could grasp that concept.

472,laura_cutie_123,A Controversial depiction of society,7,18 May 2010,"NBK Oliver Stones controversial film describes Mickey and Mallorys journey through America going on a Killing Spree.The film could be seen as a comment on medias influence on society through the use of different mediums of visual codes and technical codes. Visually NBK is complex, offering a variety of formats such as Cartoon and Black and White and includes specific detailed objects in the mise en scene to provide the reader with deeper meanings that suggest the films message of a dysfunctional society (the appearance of the American flag upside-down). Combining Colour and black in white with Stones criticism of media (particularly the inclusion of television in colour and reality in black and white) could represent how society see the constructed media as a far more real experience than life itself. The film also focuses on the desensitisation of violence withing the culture and society of the modern day. Killings are generally graphic and random, not following the 'Rebel with a cause' theme suggested in other Lovers on the Lam genre films. The American dream, a motif that occurs frequently is apparent throughout NBK. The appearance of signs such as 'Murder me Mickey' provides evidence that, in society today even serial killers can become famous as though a star.

However, it is behind the camera where the problems start to occur. Oliver Stone's insistence to completely ignore the story and focus entirely on mindless and repetitive violence which leaves the film feeling empty. Some very 'distinctive' camera-work makes an original effort at conveying certain character moods and states, to a certain degree of success, but the minimal success is coupled with the audience being led into a uncomfortable state of nausea, questioning whether the film was actually just a boring,violently charged hallucination.",Natural Born Killers
475,rugellin12,Natural Born Killers,7,25 April 2011,"The movie Natural Born Killers is about a couple, Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) who travel across the Midwest, ruthlessly killing innocent people for the joy and fame. Mickey and Mallory's trademark of their work is that they will kill everyone around them at a dine-in or store, leaving one person alive. The one person that survives is made to remember their names and to share the story of their actions. As time goes on, the Media has been following the footsteps of Mickey and Mallory, broadcasting to the world, which creates a huge fan club creating signs, shirts, and tabloids supporting the insane violence. Eventually, Mickey and Mallory get caught and put in jail where they are diagnosed with insanity. Before Mickey and Mallory are transported to a mental institution, Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.) wants to interview the killers for sky-high viewer ratings on his criminal justice show. This leads to the escape of Mickey and Mallory while using Wayne as a hostage to freely walk out the front doors of the prison at ease while a live camera has been rolling. As soon as the three of them arrive at a safe location they finish the end of the interview. Once everything has been said, Mickey props the rolling camera up on a rock, pointing up at Wayne as Mickey and Mallory point their guns at him. Wayne pleads to stay alive, trying to change their minds. There was nothing Wayne could say to persuade their minds, so he accepts his fate and stood with his arms spread out as if he were on a cross, ready to die.The theme of the movie represents the influence that media has over people. The media shows a large amount of violence because of the high rating scores they receive from viewers. Natural Born Killers explains that people waste all their time watching too much television, which turns them into mind numbing zombies.Two techniques in the movie that was used often are dramatic camera angles and different color lighting in specific scenes. The tilted camera angle and the constant jerking view gave a sense of feeling the experience of the action Mickey and Mallory had throughout the entire movie. The scene where Mickey, Mallory, and Wayne followed another convict into the showers in the prison trying to plan out an escape route; the entire screen is viewed in a green tint to represent the feeling of Wayne's greed by only thinking of himself.",Natural Born Killers
476,dk999,Not bad but has nothing new to say,6,4 May 2011,"Having been a fan of many of Oliver Stone's previous and subsequent works as well of those of the writer Quentin Tarrantino Natural Born Killers was a mild disappointment. The good things in this film include strong and convincing lead performances from Harrelson and Lewis and more than capable support from Sizemore, Downey Jr and Tommy Lee Jones. Furthermore it contains impressive set pieces that bookend the film nicely as well as some fine dialogue that means the film doesn't lack a degree of originality. However the middle section of the film lets it down with some inexplicable and even dull events that digress and rob the film of any sort of drive. Worse still is that the film is largely pointless and says nothing further on the subject of mass murderers and their glorification in the media. Films such as Bonnie and Clyde and Terrence Malick's Badlands were more the last word on this genre whereas NBK tries to upgrade this by having excessively bloody and gruesome sequences. Lastly a word on the style of the movie, Stone departs from traditional editing and throws in lots of cutting and splicing of imagery and even entire sequences in surreal settings. depending on preference viewers will find this interesting or irritating. Natural Born Killers is not a bad film but rather it is unremarkable amongst some of the better films of this genre. Overall it is a sub-par effort considering the other work done by Oliver Stone and Quentin Tarrantino.",Natural Born Killers

When NBK came out, people lost their sh*t which in all honesty is completely justified. You will either absolutely love this movie like I do, or you will hate this movie and side with all of the people who either misunderstood the message, or can't look past all of the violence. If you can deal with a bit of blood, then definitely check out this movie. (SPOILER)The main reason that the media flipped out, is that after all of the coldblooded, heartless crimes they commit, they get away.

What is most pitiful (or dangerous?) is to see how it has become a cult movie for a whole teenage (and no so-teenage) generation.

484,bryanludwig,Did not care for it.,3,23 June 2012,"Let me preface this review by saying that I bear absolutely no animosity towards the aestheticization of violence in film. I generally find that when violence is used appropriately, it is an almost gratifying visual tool. This movie though, is completely vulgar and tasteless. I had to stop watching past the sitcom scene for about an hour. I consider myself to have a pretty high threshold for dark scenes in movies (American Psycho is one of my top ten movies), but the whole sexually abusive father set to a laugh track really put a sour taste in my mouth, to say the least. I believe the scene is absolutely disgusting. To represent child abuse in such an evilly facetious way is absolutely repugnant, satirical or not. From a technical standpoint, most of the camera angles and constant switching back and forth is completely nauseating. I know that there's probably a lot of symbolism behind the constant fumbling and diagonal shots, but for a film of this low grade, I'm not too keen on looking deeply into it. To be fair though, I thought that the movie did have a few good moments in it. I can see just a little bit of QT in the screenplay (especially the Mexican standoff). I'd say that probably my favorite scene in the movie is the scene where he is being interviewed. I can see why some people may like this movie, meat-head jerks and sociopaths especially. Over all I did not care for it, but it has a few moments that were tolerable to watch.",Natural Born Killers

487,amandacore55,Great example of the shameless exploitation of the media!,8,31 July 2012,"This is an interesting take on the love story of two psychopaths whose murderous intent grows as their love grows, and the mass media that glorifies the murderous soul-mates killing spree. This blockbuster film was directed by Oliver Stone, written by Quintin Tarantino, and filled with various stars, including Woody Harrelson as Mickey Knox, Juliette Lewis as Mallory Knox, Robert Downey Jr. as Wayne Gale, the TV journalist following the Mickey and Mallory story and Tom Sizemore as Detective Jack Scagnetti, the cop whose obsession is catching Mickey and Mallory.The theme of Natural Born Killers is that two people can be living separate lives with traumatizing childhoods and be fine, but once united in love can turn murderous, and the media is very irresponsible on how they can make a story such of this filled with violence and glorify so the murderers look like celebrities.The story begins in a diner, with Mickey and Mallory. Mallory is playing songs on the jukebox when a group of rednecks start making crude comments. She smiles and plays coy with them before they beat everyone to death in the diner except one witness. They tell their remaining victim their name so everyone knows who committed the crime while stating their love for each other.As the movie continues, it flips back and forth between flashbacks of their traumatic childhoods, cartoon fantasies, memories that play out like sitcoms and senseless violence. Each seems to end with some expression of their undying love. They are followed by the obsessed psychopathic cop, Jack Scagnetti and the TV journalist Wayne Gale. They are treated like celebrities and even have groupies. The culmination of the film was after they have been arrested and put in prison and are about to be transferred to a mental institution for the criminally insane. Wayne Gale comes to do a big interview with Mickey and Mallory and a prison riot erupts. Detective Scagnetti is also at the prison, as he intends on murdering them during their transfer to the mental hospital and claiming they tried to escape. Mickey and Mallory escape, killing Scagnetti on their way out and taking Gale with them. Gale even begins to start helping them, shooting at the guards as the leave. Once outside the prison they inform Gale he must die too, with his camera left as the witness. The film then flashes to the happy couple in a RV with a very pregnant Mallory.A movie with a similar theme would be 15 Minutes, starring Ed Burns and Robert De Niro. It is also about the media's shameless exploitation of crime and murderers. Motif was used brilliantly in this film to illustrate the theme, such as the images of their psychopathic fantasies in cartoon, or their lives as a sitcom with a studio audience laughing. They rotate the motif between fantasy and reality, so you can feel and experience how insane they both are. The angles used also achieve a similar goal of illustrating how crazy they are, alternating angles in different scenes, such as when they're using drugs.While this movie is insane and violent, it definitely is unique in a disturbing way. It also highlights our society's obsession with pop culture, whether it be celebrities or murderers in a very demented way, which is sadly how morbid our culture's obsession is in real life.",Natural Born Killers

489,icultcollectors,cult collectors review,7,31 January 2013,"Natural born killers is a wild ride of death, violence, and romance. This cult movie has an original and creative plot, is an excellent philosophical fan flick, features big names is popular cult cinema, and if you haven't seen the directors cut ""you ain't seen nothing yet"". Two lovers Mickey and Mallorey Knox travel across the country in a bloody reign of terror. They value absolutely nothing but their love for one another. Mickey and Mallorey's cross country massacre turns them into celebrity icons with the of the fiction television persona Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.).The film has been called a parody of violence in American pop culture. People who don't understand the deeper meaning of the film can become confused and write off the movie as just been filled with senseless violence. But for fans of this classic its a visual master piece with stunning cinematography. Throughout the film clips transition from color to black and white, from animation to footage, the images move like channels moving on a television screen. This classic piece of art is an attempt to expose the dark side of modern culture. Natural born killers stars Woody Harrelson (The People vs. Larry Flynt) as Mickey and Juliette Lewis (From Dusk Till Dawn) as Mallorey. Other notable cast members are Rodney Dangerfield (Caddy Shack), Tommy Lee Jones (No Country for Old Men), and Tom Sizemore (True Rommance). The films original story was written by Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) but was heavily revised for screen play by the films director Oliver Stone (Platoon). The directors cut of this cult motion picture includes the best available extras. The disc contains a commentary, deleted and extra scenes, bonus footage, plus cast and crew interviews. It also features Ashley Judd's courtroom scene, Tommy Lee Jones' impaled decapitated head, a shot of Robert Downey Jr.'s hand wound, and a never before seen performance of Denis Leary (Suicide Kings).

491,Tyler_Durkin,"Directed Beautifully, although not as big as it was hyped up to be.",7,27 December 2004,"Well what can I say; I'll start with the bad then move onto the good. I thought the first hour of this film wasn't particularly good. It was too experimental. They used too many different shot variations (which where all great and everything but all in one film was too much) and for a so called shocking film I was disappointed. The killings were not portrayed like the killings in other films. For example Scarface, Oliver Stone could well of used similar techniques used in the chainsaw killing in that film so that the audience may not have seen the killing but knew what was going on. Since Oliver Stone was part of the Scarface production maybe he should have taken the experience from that film to this? The first half should have had more violence more killing and should have portrayed the characters a lot worse than what they looked to be.Moving on to the second half of the film which I was awoken by an improved script whilst still having the directing genius of Oliver Stone. The scene of with the Native American I thought was the turning point. It told us more about them being controlled by a devil similar to the exorcist if you like. The characters seemed to become something else. When they were imprisoned they became loved for what they did (Murder) maybe a little unrealistic.The choice of actors for me was slightly confusing. With a script by Quentin Tarentino and Oliver Stone in the 'chair' why didn't this bring names like DeNiro or Spacey to play the part of Mickey, and maybe Carrie Ann Moss to play Mallory (sorry couldn't think of a female actor off hand to play Mallory)? These actors could well have given the characters a lot more meaning, and Mallory and Mickey could well of been bigger than Doctor Hannibal. I do think that Tommy Lee Jones did perform very well and he defiantly played a great part in this film.Natural Born Killers was filmed in around 53 days so to do this must have been stressful for the cast and crew. So I feel they all deserve a big pat on the back.For a film which had been 'bigged' up to me and for all the controversial killings that had happened due to people being influenced by this film, all I can say in response to this is that it is not what I would call shocking cinema, but more like a creative and experimental film montage which in my opinion is good. In no way can this film be responsible or blamed for the actions of the audience.Oh and the marriage scene I thought was probably one of the most effective pieces of camera work I have seen. I loved the way the camera took the audience across the two characters and over the edge of the bridge. I felt as if I was actually there looking over the edge of the bridge.I really hope they don't make a sequel because I can't really see it being better than this.",Natural Born Killers

Give or take slight exaggeration, it portrays a clear example of the media's influences of mindless western masses to an immoral act that the majority of human instinct should be able to over power. I do believe killing is a natural animal instinct that as an evolutionary species, most humans should be able to distinguish as wrong. Yet when these 'natural born killers' create these anomalies of the human being, through media their faults can be praised and cheered, as the decreasing presence of morals, values and individuality of western society become history. But maybe all is not lost in western society. It is uplifting to see a couple truly devoted to each other.

This is because of the poorly put together nature of the film. Oliver Stone took a great script idea, (two mass-murdering lovers who become idolised by the media for their gruesome deeds. Sounds like promising material for a cutting satire? maybe some Tarantino dark humour?) and made an overly pretentious, shallow movie. Many people mention the 'beautiful' use four different film stocks, however it does little more than act as a shallow diversion and does little to enhance the movie, Oliver Stone fails to pull it of with half the artistic talent that Tony Scott achieved in 'Man on Fire'. The use of back projection allows for some entertaining, and in some case actually relevant, visual metaphors. There is some truly excellent scenes but having read the original Tarantino screenplay I have to say Oliver's changes did little to improve it. Showing none of the intelligence the original script had and removing many of the scenes which actually relate to the media based themes, and throwing the original carefully scripted use of various film stocks to the wind to create a disjointed visual style which while helping show how Mickey and Mallory view the world, may not help the reader with his/her enjoyment of the film. May I suggest you don't spend your money on this film, but try your best to see it for its style and ultimately relevant, if diluted message.As an experiment in filmaking give it 10/10, as a piece of entertainment it barely makes 5/10.

My friends prematurely dismiss this movie because of the ultraviolence and surreality, but that is what gives the movie its essence. It's all fake, and that is what Stone wishes to portray: It's only a movie, and movies are entertaining. This one happens to entertain only those who have the stomach to watch it. But, if you do watch it, you will appreciate how closely Stone relates our obsession with violence with fictional violence.

500,FutureLegend,Stone Butchers Tarantino!,4,24 July 2006,"First off, I'd like to say that I saw this movie on literally the same day that I read Tarantino's original screenplay, which was FANTASTIC. However, I noticed that the movie was described as ""deviating so much from Tarantino's script that he took his name off of the movie"". I should have taken that as a warning.The first and last scenes of the movie are ALMOST the same as Tarantion's version. From there, however, it devolves quickly into Oliver Stone's personal acid trip dealing with child molestation, the media, etc.This was NOT Tarantino's idea; it's quite obvious when you read his version. Simply put, Mickey and Mallory are supposed to be a twisted perversion of the old-fashioned 1950s couple who married for love and see themselves as the only two people on earth who really matter. They love rockabilly, they drive a 1960s car, and they cruise the back highways of America. However, they just love to kill people; they're ""natural born killers"". And they didn't kill Mallory's parents because they were abusive; it was because they didn't get her father's permission to wed. And she didn't have a brother; she blew up her entire house! And why did Stone turn them into these back-woods sounding rednecks? Mickey is supposed to be a highly intelligent, very calculating mass murderer. And also, Mickey and Mallory never fight. NEVER. They love each other unconditionally (I will add that that means ZERO infidelity as well!!). There wasn't supposed to be a message about society in ""Natural Born Killers""; it was simply a projection of society! Why did Stone have to screw with that?Granted, Woody Harrelson and Robert Downy Jr. perform wonderfully as Mickey and Wayne, but I believe that the movie was, all in all, an exercise in wasted potential. 4 stars out of 10.",Natural Born Killers

It's hard not to like Woody Harlson, but all I can think to myself is, just wow. If you're in the mood to have your mind blown watch this movie. If you can't pay attention, and you need a solid plot that actually makes sense I'd watch a different movie. It's not that the movie is bad, it's actually very comical. It's just that I have no idea of what's going on. It's a very similar film style to Pulp Fiction, it's very reminiscent of the 70's but with hints of the 50's thrown in. If you wanted a great Tarantino movie, I'd suggest you watch Pulp Fiction. At the very least Pulp Fiction has a stable plot that can be understood by anyone who is not Quentin Tarantino. A good movie, but not enough acid in my system to understand. But I've only watched 9 minutes and 38 seconds, so take my review with a grain of sand.",Natural Born Killers
502,sloofy,Easily one of the best and most influential movies of the 90's...,9,15 June 2005,"I've watched this movie countless times, and like another poster had mentioned, ALL of Oliver Stone's movies are easily watchable more than just once. Another great movie of his is U-Turn. I own the unrated version, and after watching the interviews with the crew involved in making the movie, i was like ""I knew it! I knew SOMEONE had to be on shrooms making this movie!"" fact is, mostly the entire crew was. Excellent ;) The best part about this movie is the amount of different types of film, and the numerous cinematography methods that were used in creating it. The fact that the media blames this movie for motivating kids to kill people is just absurd. If someone is able to be influenced by a movie or music into doing something like shooting or killing someone, THEY have MENTAL issues that go waaaay beyond blaming a movie for the reasons WHY they committed these crimes. The movie is in fact VIOLENT, but there are plenty of other movies out there that are just as violent, or even more-so. (I.E. Kill Bill, Ichi the Killer, Saving Private Ryan, etc..)The point Oliver Stone tries to make in this movie is that the MEDIA itself GLORIFIES death and killing, and serial killers. You can't turn on the 6'o'clock news without hearing about someone being shot or killed, or stabbed. Rarely do you hear of honorable and positive things on the news. This is the same reason why people tend to ""LOOK"" when there is an accident on the side of the road... people are attracted to death and things out-of-the-ordinary by NATURE. All in all, this movie is one of my favorite movies of all time, and proves the point of just how f*cked up the media has become, and how IT is continuing to effect society negatively.",Natural Born Killers
503,thenfev,Drug Infused Lovers,8,18 January 2016,Started watching this good old film as I have heard a lot about it from my friends in the police force. I am happy to say I enjoyed it. The violence is very realistic and thoroughly deserves an Oscar for murder. I also found that this film reminded of school shootings I have been to during my 20 years at the force although I have found that I can relate to the main Character Mickey as the way he struggles through the film is very similar to the way Mickey mouse struggles in Mickeys mouse club house as the quest is very similar. I found that scagnetti was very similar to me as I have also killed a prostitute and also a few random people as a side hobby to keep me entertained when the crime dries up. And finally I believe the political environment was not realistic for Skyrim at this time. SKYRIM BELONGS TO THE NORDS. finally this film has a hidden message that Bonnie and Clyde's death was an inside job.This review is done by Mickey Knox in 1200 BC,Natural Born Killers
504,areabastarda,This is the NINETIES,10,15 December 2010,"This is easily one of my all-time favorite movies. It's, well, a hell of a ride, but it's actually much more than that: it's wildly, fiercely creative, it takes no hostages... and it's about where the world was heading at by then, and that's, YEAH... where we're stuck right now, almost hitting 2011.I also love this piece of art because of a melancholic reason: it simply summons what the 90s were. Whenever I want to look back at that pretty crazy decade, I put NBK on...... And I always get chills doing so, because, as Mickey says, ""we've seen nothing yet"".",Natural Born Killers
505,rootbeerlily,This movie gave me vertigo,1,30 March 2020,"I don't know if it's just me, but the way it was filmed, with the constantly changing angles and weird shot transitions made me feel dizzy and nauseated.That being said, it was certainly an interesting film, and I think it was worth a watch (but I will not be watching it again).",Natural Born Killers
506,cherry_drop_gizmo,What I Think,10,4 August 2005,"I know a lot of you out there don't like this film, but yeah, it is in my top 5 favourite films, true, I'm not into Oliver Stone's directing much...but the film itself stood alone, his name didn't even have to be on it and i would still love it.Some of the movie was a bit patchy and sent me wondering, but it came all together at the end i thought, i couldn't wait to watch it over and over, and have been doing since i saw it for the first time. The characters strike me as being well written. But that is just my opinion, i know most of you may not agree with me.Juliette Lewis (personal hero of mine) was excellent in it, along with Woody Harelson, they all play great parts in the film, it was mind blowing for me, sent my whole film world into another dimension...So yeah, just to put my views up.Gemma xx",Natural Born Killers
507,JBrack218,Blood never looked so lovely.,8,16 November 2005,"Not only is Natural Born Killers a shoot-em-up--kill-em-dead flick, but a brilliant commentary on the Nation of Fear the media is said to create, and more importantly, a beautiful love story. Nothing can tear Mickey and Mallory Knox apart and their oh-so-manifested lust for blood only brings them closer together in ways only a psychopathic killer could comprehend. From the moment Mickey comes back for Mallory, killing brought them together. The sweet, rational passion in which Mickey kills Mallory's parents was the first true testament to their unbreakable love.Oliver stone's direction and cinematography add rich aught to the themes and motifs of the story. Natural Born Killers, though an acquired taste, is the mind trip of all mind trips, combining blood, sex, gore, violence, vulgarity, and hate with romance, passion, beauty, art, and love. After all, it's just murder.",Natural Born Killers

509,carmeloigm,Don't waste your time watching it,3,31 August 2006,"Some weeks ago, I found the DVD of Natural Born Killers in a bookstall at the price of 390 and I decided to buy it and watch it. What I can say about this movie after watching it is that it is a sort of mix of Clockwork Orange, Bonnie and Clyde and Easy Rider, but it is done very badly.It is a mess of useless violence, blood, senseless images that come on the screen without any reason. The story is not interesting, the action sequences are at the same level of the worst Steven Seagal movies, the only positive thing is Tommy Lee Jones that plays perfectly.I want to recommend not to watch this movie, prefer rather the movies I cited in this reviews (Clockwork Orange, Bonnie and Clyde, Easy Rider or even Steven Seagal!). For me, it was a waste of 390 and of two hours of my time.",Natural Born Killers

The philosophy it described in the first half and the philosophy it described in the last half completely contradict but it doesn't matter because it's not possible to focus on the movie and understand something!",Natural Born Killers
511,jeffin42,"I liked 1 shot in the entire film, so it gets a 1.",1,3 June 2006,"everything in this movie seems to be done with the general thinking, ""Just because"". The opening scene does little more than make me dizzy with totally unmotivated cuts from black&white to color. this is again repeated at the end we're Woody Harolson, who surprisingly gave a usual good performance despite the idiotic directing, cocks his shot gun several times before actually firing it. Then there's the scene in the supermarket where no one bothered to change out the fluorescent lighting, and tried to cover up the stupid mistake by blowing out the green color to make it ""artistic"". WHAT EVER!!!!!Damm you Oliver Stone. If someone took one of my scripts, and turned it into that, I'd swear never to let anyone get a hold of my stories again too. And this could be the only time you hear me defending Quentin Tarantino. Not that you really know who I am or even care. Not that anyone's going to actually read this, but like I said. what ever.",Natural Born Killers
512,Kornispeachy666,A surreal adventure which makes killing fun!,10,21 July 2006,"Possibily one of the greatest films ever made. Oliver stone bring excitement back into films with this innovative and creative ride through the adventure of Mickey and Mallory. The good thing about this film is also the mix of comedy moments, such as the opera music used when someone is killed by a knife. Mickey and Mallory make an excellent pair and Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis play the parts perfectly. The relentless killing spree they embark on is entertaining and extremely watchable. With the mix of surreal bits thrown in now and again to describe the possibly torment of the characters this creates a drug filled effect. My favourite scene being the scene in the drug store where the use of heavy green lucid lights create a luminous effect and makes the viewer a little dizzy. The prison break is a clever piece of filming. The use of hand-held cam puts the viewer into the action and showers the torture of the guards and the mayhem and chaos of the rioting. With also the use of a good soundtrack with the like of nine inch nails and rage against the machine put to good effect, it makes this film and awesome experience! Mickey and Mallory make killing fun! and turn it into a crime of passion and lust!",Natural Born Killers
513,macciecx,"crime , murder and blood on live TV",9,31 August 2013,"This is not the movie for an average American , who sit watching sitcoms all day . This is a movie about the mind of a killer , this is a very serious and poignant view into the brain of a mad people who live in this world , most Americans can not comprehend how the mind of the killer works , but Hitler and Stalin were just like that , they loved their ideas , and by killing innocent people they were elevated into belief that they were above average person , Mickey tells it exactly how it feels , he thinks he is above everyone , because he can kill . I can understand why so many Americans hate this movie , because it shows how media glorify violence , and show it all the time to gain viewing from everybody . Wake up people , this not a lie , this is not even close to real life madness and murder , This is happening all over the world , don't you remember WTC ? videos of cutting the heads of the body by al kaida ? tortures in Guantanamo? Drug wars in Mexico? This movie is nothing compared to violence going on everyday on this planet.",Natural Born Killers
