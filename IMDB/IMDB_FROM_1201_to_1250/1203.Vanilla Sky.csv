0,bkoganbing,The Lucid Dream Option,6,13 November 2008,"Tom Cruise as David Aames has it all, as we used to say in my neighborhood by the short hairs of the scrotum in a more earthy manner. Unlimited wealth, good looks, what is there in the world to want for. He's got an occasional sex partner in Cameron Diaz, but a chance meeting in a bar with Penelope Cruz, tells him she's the one.But it's not to be after he gets into an automobile accident and becomes horribly disfigured. We're talking here about a man not used to having too many really bad life curves tossed at him. However with his wealth he can take an option not too many of us have. Cruise gets himself cryogenically frozen with a 150 year expiration date in the hope that science will develop the technology to fix his face. He even gets to dream with implanted images of the good times.Director Cameron Crowe used some old movie clips for things Cruise identified with in Vanilla Sky. The one that would have explained it all was from Forbidden Planet where Warren Stevens after he takes the Krel brain test, tells Leslie Nielsen that those Krel forgot all about the Id. It's that Id that keeps screwing up Tom's dream, turning it into a big old nightmare. Vanilla Sky is a good film, could have been a lot better for me if I had some warning of what was going on. The film is like a big budget remake in some ways of The Trial, that Kafka drama that starred Anthony Perkins and Orson Welles. Except Tom's trial was all in his mind.Tom's worldwide legion of fans should like it though.",Vanilla Sky
1,SnoopyStyle,interesting confusion,6,5 October 2015,"David Aames (Tom Cruise) is a vain publisher playboy in NYC. His friend Brian Shelby (Jason Lee) brings his date Sofia Serrano (Penélope Cruz) to a party and David finds the love of his life. Volatile ex Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) drives his car off a bridge to kill herself and disfigures his face. At a later time, he is wearing a mask in jail charged with an unknown murder as he recounts his story to psychologist Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell).This is a confusing movie. I'm not sure Cameron Crowe is the guy to adapt this strange Spanish movie. I think it would be more compelling to have more of this movie to be dreamlike in a visually surreal way. Cameron Crowe is not a visual director. The empty streets of New York are an interesting way to start but he needs to do more. It is a pretty interesting confusing movie but something keeps bugging me about it. My take on the ending is coma but it could mean so many things.",Vanilla Sky
2,Hitchcoc,It's Quite Innovative and Highly Engaging,9,11 January 2017,"Even if I don't always like Tom Cruise, the man, mainly because of his pomposity and his L. Ron Hubbard stuff, I seem to really enjoy his movies. In this one, his character is much like him. He is not heartless, but not far from it. He is spoiled and entitled. He has expectations of others, including women, that he is the be all and end all. One day his life changes when he is in a car with the Cameron Diaz character, whom he actually exploits. She is willing to kill both of them rather than live without him. What follows is one of the most circumlocative plots, with apparent supernatural elements, dream sequence, cryonics, etc. A criticism of this film would be that it is so bizarrely convoluted, that reality is hard to discern. There is some validity to that, but it also makes it incredibly interesting. Sometimes I'd rather see a director or producer try to exceed their grasp. I would also recommend that the previous film ""Open Your Eyes"" is its own film. Must we always try to demean something because it has an antecedent.",Vanilla Sky
3,jboothmillard,Vanilla Sky,2,23 February 2009,"This is a remake of a Spanish thriller film called Open Your Eyes (quoted in the film), from director Cameron Crowe (Jerry Maguire), I think I'd prefer the original to this. Basically, in what looks like a not-too-distant future, David Aames (Tom Cruise, also producing) has inherited a playboy lifestyle from his dead parents, and at a party he meets the girl his friend Brian Shelby (My Name Is Earl's Jason Lee) brought, Sofia Serrano (Razzie nominated Penélope Cruz), and he instantly falls for her. He wants to find out more about Sofia, but he is being stalked almost by jilted lover Julie Gianni (Golden Globe nominated Cameron Diaz), and she ends up crashing her car off a bridge, with David inside. While Julie died, David survived and had his face reconstructed, and not long after, he is finding it hard to distinguish between his dreams and reality. He is desperate to be with Julie, but being in an unstable condition, he is first trying to get back to reality, with the help of psychiatrist McCabe (Kurt Russell). In a ridiculous twist ending, you find out he has been dreaming for ages, because he is in fact dead, but he still has the chance to decide whether to go into a dream where he can have anything he wants and be happy, never ageing, or go back to reality and have a normal life, and thank goodness, he chooses reality. Also starring Noah Taylor as Edmund Ventura, Timothy Spall as Thomas Tipp, Tilda Swinton as Rebecca Dearborn, Alicia Witt as Libby, Johnny Galecki as Peter Brown, Conan O'Brien, and look for Steven Spielberg as a Party Guest. This film is one of the most confusing and ridiculous I have ever seen in my life, and I hope I never do again. All the actors are wasting their talents, the story is filled with material you cannot understand - in terms of story and putting on screen, and it just seems like director Crowe wasn't putting enough effort into making a good a film, which I can safely say it isn't. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for Paul McCartney's title song, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song. Tom Cruise was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Pretty poor!",Vanilla Sky
4,Tweekums,What is reality?,8,15 July 2009,"Before starting to review this film I must say that I have not yet seen the Spanish film on which it is based so can't say whether it does justice to the source material or not. This is one of those films one has to watch more than once to understand as things we learn at the end of the film effect how one views the events earlier on. Often it is impossible to tell if what we are watching is real, a dream or a delusion.Tom Cruise plays David Aames a yuppie who has inherited his father's publishing empire. He is sleeping with Julie but there is no real relationship in his mind they are just friends who occasionally spend the night together she however believes it means far more than that. At his birthday party David meets Sofia, a beautiful Spanish woman played by Penélope Cruz, he spends some time with her but nothing physical happens. When he sets off for work Julie is there and asks him to get into her car, she then starts raving about how he must love her then crashes her car off a bridge.Things then start to be fairly strange, one minute David is well and talking to Sofia the next he is seriously disfigured from the accident talking to doctors about how they can help him, at this point all the can offer is a rubber mask which gives him an appearance that is almost like a statue; fairly realistic yet cold and emotionless. He is later told that there is a radical new treatment that will repair his face, he has this and when the mask is removed he is back to his old good looking self. He starts to have nightmares though, sometimes he imagines the disfigurement has returned, other times he thinks that Sofia is in fact Julie. He even believes that he has killed her but isn't certain which one of them. He is taken into custody and his world gets more and more insane, eventually he is taken to a company which specialises in cryogenicly freezing people immediately after they die, here he learns an alarming truth.Tom Cruise did a great job as David, it is rare to see a good looking major star playing a character which for much of the film is disfigured unless it is the sort of serious film that is angling for awards. Penélope Cruz was also good as Sofia. I'd certainly recommend this to people who like to watch something different and don't mind not understanding everything they see as they see it.",Vanilla Sky
5,moonspinner55,The subconscious mind is a terrible thing to waste...,4,10 November 2005,"An elongated, overproduced ""Twilight Zone"" episode, written and directed by Cameron Crowe, starring Tom Cruise as a magazine publishing mogul in New York City who is having a hard time distinguishing reality from his dreams; soon, he finds himself imprisoned, masked, and talking to a doctor about a murder he has apparently committed. Proving that the greatest asset a film can have is a strong screenplay, ""Vanilla Sky"" is a series of half-hearted whims and self-indulgent larks. The shards of reality and non-reality, interpolated in rapid succession, aren't so much truthful glimpses into our hero's psyche as they are Crowe's cocky idea of a mind-screw. Americanizing the 1997 Spanish-language film ""Abre Los Ojos"", Crowe is like a jovial rich kid messing with the switches until his film becomes the equivalent of a joy-buzzer. It's both a curious paean to popular culture and the (would-be) ultimate brain-gasm. ""Vanilla Sky"" (terrible title!) doesn't make much sense in the end--and it doesn't elicit much interest, either, because the majority of the characters are cyphers. ** from ****",Vanilla Sky
6,blanche-2,Interesting but ultimately disappointing,5,28 January 2002,"This film is worth seeing on several levels but ultimately it disappoints. The lead role was a perfect fit for Tom Cruise - normally, I find him external and not really believable; however, in this part, I liked his acting.  His scene before a panel of doctors is especially effective. I always love Cameron Diaz.  As for Penelope Cruz, I will only ask, what is the big deal.I thought I was going to be watching a compelling murder mystery.  Turns out that wasn't really the case. The way the true plot is introduced, very late into the film (like the end), I felt like it was the kitchen sink being thrown in.  That is one objection I have.  The other objection I have is, though the film only ran about two hours, it moved very slowly and seemed MUCH longer.  Whenever that's the case, you know there's a problem.  Fifteen minutes at the beginning could easily have been cut and we would have gotten the point of the main character's life and lifestyle, and the pivotal scene of the film would have been moved back considerably.Nevertheless, if you're up for seeing something that will spark discussion, intrigue you and has depth to it, this is a good one to see. It doesn't succeed but hey, Cameron Crowe tried.",Vanilla Sky
7,Quinoa1984,"Pretty strange, but entertaining and slickly crafted",8,16 December 2001,"Cameron Crowe's (originally Alejandro Amenabar's) Vanilla Sky is a film where reality and dreams (er Nightmares) are blended together into a maddening yet almost refreshing look at one man's trip (that would've been a good explanation) through love, death, and other things in life.  This man is played by Tom Cruise who runs half of a magazine business in New York who has a affair lover on the side (Cameron Diaz who isn't that bad in her scenes), but then falls in love one night with another woman (Penelope Cruz) and then the plot unfolds from there.  You can try to follow along with where the film is going, but be warned that at some point the film diverges into the stranger, and more surreal, though it's explained at the end. Worthwhile despite it's shortcomings, with actual human characters enriching the atmosphere.  Jason Lee and Kurt Russell also star. B+",Vanilla Sky
8,wes-connors,The Iceman Cometh,5,16 August 2008,"The less read about this vanity project, before you watch it, the better (provided you haven't seen the original, acknowledged to be superior 1997 ""Abre los ojos"" aka ""Open Your Eyes""). The main problem is that young, handsome, and wealthy Tom Cruise (as David Aames)'s ""David"" is neither likable nor engagingly unlikable. Mr. Cruise has good taste in women, like precious Penélope Cruz (as Sofia) and jealous Cameron Diaz (as Julie Gianni); but, the movie isn't very sexy. Ms. Cruz played the same role in the original, sexier film (with Eduardo Noriega). Ms. Diaz and Jason Lee (as Brian Shelby) are most enjoyable, in supporting roles. Cinematographer John Toll is also outstanding. Cruise and director Cameron Crowe have excellent taste in music; they take an ""everything but the kitchen sink"" approach to the soundtrack by sampling The Beatles' obscure ""Revolution 9"", without the screaming Yoko. It's a ""Revolution of the mind"".***** Vanilla Sky (2001) Cameron Crowe ~ Tom Cruise, Penélope Cruz, Cameron Diaz",Vanilla Sky
9,michaelRokeefe,When the dream of a life becomes a nightmare.,7,14 January 2002,"Director Cameron Crowe strikes gold with an intelligent, erotic and frustrating romantic drama. This is one of those love or hate movies. I absolutely love it. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a multi-millionaire that seems to have the whole world by the tail. Inheriting leadership of a multi-faceted publishing business at such a young age has not endeared him with the seven member board of directors. His womanizing is legendary and subject to much speculation. He is stalked by an obsessive lover(Cameron Diaz)and his life soon becomes very scrambled when he meets an attractive Penelope Cruz at his birthday party. The Diaz character gets fed up with competing for lover boy's affection and decides to commit suicide by driving off of a bridge with him in the car. Aames is left disfigured and charged with murder.Whirlwind flashback sequences accompanied with a tremendous soundtrack pace this mind wrecking, nerve snarling, and confusing, but interesting piece of storytelling. Cruise is totally in control of his talents. This is one of his best performances. Miss Cruz is adequate and highly overrated. The perky, gorgeous Diaz is sexy and haunting. Kurt Russell is compassionate and strong as Dr. McCabe. Jason Lee is underrated and deserves kudos for his part as the best friend of the egotistical lead character that seems to always be there to be s**it on and humiliated.The star studded soundtrack features music by R.E.M., Peter Gabriel, Jeff Buckley, Nancy Wilson, Bob Dylan and the haunting movie theme song ""Vanilla Sky"" by Sir Paul McCartney. This project also features the singing debut of Miss Diaz singing ""I Fall Apart"" written by Cameron Crowe and Nancy Wilson.Like this one or not; understand this one or not...this movie will give you something to contemplate and more than enough to talk about.",Vanilla Sky
10,sunwarrior13,A Different Type Of Psychological Thriller,10,9 October 2011,"Vanilla Sky is co-produced,co-written and directed by Cameron Crowe. The film stars Tom Cruise, Penélope Cruz and Cameron Diaz, with Jason Lee and Kurt Russell.It is a remake of the 1997 Spanish movie Abre los ojos (Open Your Eyes).The movie is a psychological thriller about David Aames,a successful publisher who takes all he has for granted; his wealth, his inherited company, his good looks and his relationships.It catches up to him when a friend/casual sex-partner is disappointed with their relationship and leads him to a car accident.Then the movie transform itself into a surrealistic psychological film. I had to see this film twice to fully understand and appreciate the story of the movie.It is not a film for everyone as it consists of symbols and meanings.The performances were great in this film particularly that of Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. The music in the movie was great as well featuring outstanding original song, Vanilla Sky by Paul McCartney; and two Radiohead songs, Everything In Its Right Place and I Might Be Wrong.A highly recommended film for people who are into psychology and who wants deep thinking when watching a film feature.",Vanilla Sky

12,Theo Robertson,Attractive Cast In A Shallow Film,7,30 April 2004,"I`ve never seen the Spanish movie ABRE LOS OJOS on which VANILLA SKY is based but do recall that everyone who has seen the original European movie destest this Hollywood remake . I will be honest in saying that I absolutely loved this version first time I saw it . In fact it came close to beating BLACK HAWK DOWN as my second favourite release from 2001 ( FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING being my outstanding favourite movie from that year ) but then when I saw it a second time I was far less impressed ***** POSSIBLE SPOILER ***** Because the plot twist at the end this is not a movie that stands up to repeated viewing . In many ways it`s like watching a whodunnit where you know fine well who the murderer is which means all the suspense of working out what`s happening to Tom Cruise`s character has totally evaporated , it`s to all intents and purposes a one trick pony . It should also be pointed out that by 2001 the premise of this movie was starting to go stale since the central idea of TOTAL RECALL and THE MATRIX and its sequels have similar ideas , and watching it again I do get the impression that it`s a rather shallow film despite - Or because of - the director putting in a large amount of pop culture into the proceedings . I should also point out Tom Cruise seems to have a problem playing such a bitter and twisted character , yeah he was a revelation in BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY but can`t seem able to inject enough anger onto his on screen performance here
But no doubt a lot of women hired this on video simply because it starred Cruise . It`s not really fair that one man can be so good looking especially since the only film star this reviewer resembles is Gollum from THE TWO TOWERS . I can`t help also noticing that most of the comments from people who hate this movie are male . I honestly believe this comes down to wives watching this on video in the comfort of their home , dragging their husband to bed as soon as the closing credits start , making wild passionate love and screaming "" TOM "" at that most intimate climatic moment . Well Ive got a question for you ladies - Who do you think your husband was fantasizing about during that mind blowing sex session ? Was it Penelope Cruz or was it Cameron Diaz ?",Vanilla Sky
13,preppy-3,Another lousy Tom Cruise movie,1,27 December 2001,"Long, boring, stupid movie about Cruise...oh forget it!  I can't be bothered!  This movie was total crap--bad script (especially the end), very dull and overlong...I believe 5 people walked out of the theatre...I should have joined them.The acting--Cameron Diaz is very good--sadly, she's not in the movie enough to make a difference.  Penelope Cruz tries but the script isn't there for her.  Jason Lee is surprisingly very good as Cruise's best friend.  As for Cruise...well...he can't act.  He's truly pathetic in this film...it was almost embarrassing to watch.  His character comes off as a total blank because Cruise doesn't know how to play it.  The guy has just two facial expressions--grinning or having a slack-jawed ""I'm stupid"" expression on his face.  Hopeless.  He's ugly too.  Also, he's playing a 32 year old here. Come on!!!!  Cruise is 39 and looks it!This is a total waste of time and money.  AVOID!!!!!!!",Vanilla Sky
14,LeonLouisRicci,"A Frantic & Fanciful, Disturbing & Distinctive Experience",8,3 February 2016,"""Sh-Boom, Sh-Boom...Life is but a Dream...Sweetheart""...The Crew CutsA thorough Review of this Movie requires Spoilers, so Let's Not go there. It's a Surreal, Complex, and Confusing Movie that can be Painstaking to Penetrate because the Film has Multiple Layers of Reality and Existence.It really can't be Enjoyed in the Traditional sense, it must be Experienced as a Puzzle of the Mind and probably has a Multitude of Interpretations. After Viewing, if one is Inclined, there is a goodly amount of Verbiage that can be Uncovered about its Meaning or Lack Thereof.It was Constructed by Writer/Director Cameron Crowe, Remaking a Foreign Film that Translates as Open Your Eyes (""Abre Los Ojos"", 1997), as a Pop-Culture, Pop-Psychology Movie with many References to Art in and around the Cultural Landscape.Tom Cruise, in a Difficult Performance, is Up to the Task, with Good Support from Penelope Cruz (cute and sweet), Cameron Diaz (very disturbing and scary), with Jason Lee, and Kurt Russell.But the Film is the Directors, Utilizing Visual and Aural Flourishes that are Artistic and add to an Ease of accepting the Density within the Story, and it is Very Dense. So Much so that many Viewers find it Frustrating and Incomprehensible.Overall, Not an Easy Watch that can be Awkward but very Creepy at times. A Film Not for Everyone and a certain amount of Patience and Attention is Required. The Closer one Looks the More that can be Found. But it is possibly too Laborious for Casual Movie-Goers.",Vanilla Sky
15,Boba_Fett1138,Good movie but suffers from the same minor problems as the original.,7,21 October 2005,"The original ""Abre los ojos"" was a great but not perfect movie. It had a bit of a dragging beginning and especially middle-part. Unfortunately this remake suffers from the same problem and is even a bit worse with its dragging parts. In the first hour and an halve it's still mainly unclear where the movie is heading to and makes perhaps a bit of a pointless impression. Just like in the original, the ending compensates for this even though the ending for this movie isn't build up as a good and executed as in the original was the case. Yes, it's a pointless remake. ""Abre los ojos"" is perfectly watchable for everyone. You don't have to be a fan of European cinema to enjoy that movie. The original is also just a tiny bit better but that doesn't mean that ""Vanilla Sky"" itself is a bad movie on its own. It has some great acting performances from Tom Cruise and especially Cameron Diaz in it. Quite honestly, I have never seen Diaz acting better in any other movie. Other well know actors in this movie are Penélope Cruz (who reprises her role from the original but she isn't halve as good in this movie as she was in the original.), Kurt Russell, Noah Taylor, Jason Lee and Timothy Spall with who Cruise later teamed up again for ""The Last Samurai"".The atmosphere is good. New York is the perfect background for the movie its story. The story is good and surprising enough for everyone to enjoy even though at times it tries too hard to be confusing.It's a good movie but you're still better of watching the original. Are the many difference between this movie its story and that of the original? Hardly, both movies are very similar with the story, sequences and even dialog. Still ""Abre los ojos"" is a better movie because it builds up the story and characters better and has a better, more powerful and surprising executed ending.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Vanilla Sky
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"A very interesting and fascinating film, though the original is better",8,12 June 2004,"First, I'd like to mention that since watching this, I have seen Abre Los Ojos(or 'Open Your Eyes', as it's called in English), the film which this is a remake of. Upon comparison, the Spanish original is by far the better film, in my opinion, in that it is more ambiguous and dark, and more of a science fiction piece, less of a drama. I won't claim that this means that this movie is nothing more than a Hollywood version of the original(as some might suspect it is). This does have its own merit, and Crowe does a fairly good job of translating the film without losing the essence. The film is very interesting, as it's based on a pretty old idea in science fiction(which I won't reveal here, as it's impossible to tell it without giving away the twist of the film, thereby pretty much ruining the experience of it), and it utilizes this idea, which is pretty much the main theme of the film(though you don't know this until the very end) very good. The plot is very good, something most people can relate to, and it moves along at an pretty good pace, but on repeated viewings it does get a little boring. The character development is well-handled, you know what you want and need to know about the characters. The acting is all good, there isn't really any of the actors who doesn't do his or her job well. The characters are well-written and credible. I enjoyed the humor in the film, and the well-placed self-irony of Tom Cruise's character in some scenes. There isn't a lot of humor in the film, but the amount there is, is just right, I think. I liked the film for messing with the audience's mind so much. I will, however, agree with those that say that the end explained too much; it didn't leave much room for further analysis, instead it just handed the answers to you on a silver platter. That was a bad decision, definitely, and it was far better in the original, Spanish film. Explaining everything might have opened it up to a broader audience, but dumbing it down like that disappointed a lot of people who could have figured it out by themselves, and should have been given the chance. Alejandro Almenabar is, by far, the superior director, and his version, the original, Abre Los Ojos, is definitely better than this, and more intelligent, less mainstream. I do think Cameron Crowe did a nice job, though. I recommend this to fans of science fiction and drama, who have the patience for it, and the ability to think about what they see, instead of just taking it for being exactly what it seems to be. 8/10",Vanilla Sky
17,view_and_review,I'm Slightly More Pro Than Con,6,2 February 2021,"""Vanilla Sky"" is a movie in which you have to wait for the payoff. I know you may be saying, ""Don't you have to wait for the payoff in every movie?"" Yes, for the most part, but they don't leave you confused as they deliver you to the payoff. ""Vanilla Sky"" leaves you in a state of semi-bewilderment as you wait to find out what it's all about.Our main character, David Ames (Tom Cruise), is a rich inheritor of a thriving magazine publisher. He owns 51% of the shares in the company which gives him a controlling interest in the company. He is a rich playboy who is heavily resented by the seven member board which he pejoratively calls the seven dwarves. His whole life changed when a scorned lover/****-buddy (Cameron Diaz) tried to kill him and herself in a car crash. Or did his life change before that when he met Sofia (Penelope Cruz)? Whichever moment was ""the"" moment it was all screwy from then on.""Vanilla Sky"" is a psychological romance. I wouldn't call it a psychological thriller. Much of the movie was a whirlwind of pre-passion, passion, and post-passion between David and Sofia. It was a lot of mushy stuff that I could do without, but I stayed engaged to find out why he was dictating all of these events from a jail cell to a psychologist (Kurt Russell). If you decide to watch, and I'm only slightly more pro than con, the ending is a wee bit redeeming. Put it this way: watching until the end certainly changed my rating from about a 3 or 4/10 to a 6/10.",Vanilla Sky
18,evanston_dad,"You're Out of Your League, Cameron Crowe",4,28 July 2010,"Writer/director Cameron Crowe let the Oscar he won the previous year for ""Almost Famous"" go to his head and dives headlong into this narratively ambitious but mostly incomprehensible dream film.Crowe is out of his element, and in any case he would have needed better actors than Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz to pull this story off. About the best thing that can be said of it is that it has a pretty good title song, which brought Paul McCartney an Oscar nomination.Diaz generated quite a bit of Oscar buzz herself at the time, but for once the Academy made a wise decision and left her off the short list.Grade: C-",Vanilla Sky

I saw ""Vanilla Sky"", ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" over a 4 day span and sit here truly satisfied in my movie going for the first time in more than a year.  At times, ""Vanilla Sky"" feels like you are on the runway at a super model convention, but the beauty of the actors does not take away from the tangled web that the screenplay weaves.  I was enthralled by the twists and turns of this wild ride.  Some twists were easier to spot than others, but the recent wave of ""Sixth Sense"" wannabe's are put to shame by Cameron Crowe.  Not being a huge fan of Cruise, Cruz or Diaz, it took a remarkable story line to keep me there.  Some nice support work from many, especially Kurt Russell, who looks solidly middle aged for the first time on the big screen.  Cameron Crowe is now a top draw for me.  If he is involved, I am headed to the theatre. He knows a good story and is amazing in his ability to create believable scenes.",Vanilla Sky
20,anaconda-40658,Crowe's Great Followup to Almost Famous.,9,10 March 2016,"Vanilla Sky (2001): Dir: Cameron Crowe / Cast: Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee: Spellbinding film ripe with disturbing yet wondrous visual images straight through to the end. Similar to Mulholland Drive in that it leads a twisted and confusing path that nonetheless still intrigues. It relates to a clash of images that are not entirely there. It stars Tom Cruise who keeps having strange reoccurring dreams. He soon learns that he is up for murder and a white mask consumes his identity. He tells of an accident as his jealous girlfriends drives them over a bridge. The film depends on its bizarre vision and the skill of Cameron Crowe who previously made another great film called Almost Famous as well as direct Cruise to another very different performance in Jerry Maguire. Here Crowe succeeds in a triumph of visual design and imagery. Cruise plays a great victim to his own vanity. Cameron Diaz is excellent as his crazed ex-girlfriend whose image haunts his tortured mind. Penelope Cruz appears as his new love interest in an element that is shockingly double sided. Kurt Russell is terrific as his attorney who tries to help him sort out the confusion. Jason Lee plays an author and friend to the Cruise character, and who introduces him to Cruz before the domino effect that descends from it. Bizarre film about vanity and the dangers of lust.

She loved David, and he couldn't think with his heart towards her. Over all, a good movie. I do watch it sometimes still, I saw it in the theater, so of course I wanted to buy it to fully get the story.

22,=G=,Cheap shot,6,22 May 2002,"Filmdom is full of cheap shots; easy ways to bemuse, titillate, shock, etc. in the name of entertainment. The old screeching cat jumping out during a contrived suspenseful moment is one of the cheapest shots. Palming off dreams as reality only to later reveal they were dreams is another. Playing with the time domain is still another. Etc.In ""Vanilla Sky"" the makers play with the reality domain  while telling a nonstory and loading it up with sensationalistic crap to con the audience into a sense of having been entertained. Beyond that there's no meaningful commentary more profound than looking at billowing cumulus and seeing faces.",Vanilla Sky
23,MovieAddict2016,"Better than expected, still doesn't hold a candle to the original though",6,26 April 2005,"""Vanilla Sky"" suffers from a bit of mainstream Americanalization. (Is that a word? I don't think so, but oh well.) It's the US taking a popular and successful foreign film (the Spanish ""Obres Los Ojos,"" a.k.a. ""Open Your Eyes"") and re-working it with... Tom Cruise in the lead? ""Vanilla Sky"" is, then, the ultimate cliché of the America/remake fascination inherent in most mainstream Hollywood films these days. People on this site love to bash Hollywood for doing this - they consistently take foreign films and remake them with popular American names. Casting Cruise is a bit too much of a cliché to be true. He's America's most popular actor alive (statistically, anyway).Surprising, then, that the movie isn't bad. In fact, it's quite good, at least in a watchable sort of way. Although it doesn't hold a candle to the original, Cameron Crowe (""Fast Times"" scribe and ""Jerry Maguire"" director) is still pretty capable behind the camera and Cameron Diaz proves she has some amount of acting abilities as she portrays a character unlike any other in her resume.The big disappointment is Penelope Cruz, returning to her role in the Spanish film, only this time playing it in English. And she's not very good at speaking English and we have to wonder, ""Why did they cast her?"" Plus, and maybe this is just me... but I don't find her very attractive. Between her and Diaz, I'd take Diaz, even if she was a suicidal maniac.Overall I was rather entertained and amused by the film, even if it's nothing special. And believe me, it's not. But Tom Cruise is better than expected. And his notorious vanity pays off -- we finally get to see his face all messed up. Alas, he can't remain like this for the entire duration of the film. That would be American Hollywood sacrilege. I can just hear the producers: ""Tom Cruise playing a facially disfigured man? WHAT?!""",Vanilla Sky
24,sddavis63,Picks Up Steam As It Moves Along,6,18 May 2003,"After the first hour or so of this movie I was thinking ""this is truly bizarre."" I was finding it very difficult to follow and in all honesty not particularly interesting. But it does get better as it moves along, and by the end of the movie it had actually turned into a decent sci-fi adventure whose ending I was really very interested in.The story, as I suggest, is a bit confusing in the first hour or so and it takes some real commitment to stick with it, but it's helped along by better than average performances from the main leads - Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz. The love triangle that's represented by the three is a bit of a mystery, particularly the nature of the relationship between Cruise and Diaz, and how that relationship ends is quite shocking and was the point at which I really started to sit up and pay close attention. From there on it's interesting to watch as Cruise tries to sort out fantasy from reality and comes to terms with his ultimate fate and the decision it leaves him with.Overall this is a better than average movie; a bit long perhaps, but worth the time to watch.6/10",Vanilla Sky

26,bowmanblue,More 'Lynchian' than love,8,22 January 2018,"It's hard to imagine that in 2001 a love story starring Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz was actually considered a Box Office failure. But then that's because it wasn't a love story. However, much of the marketing that surrounded it concentrated on the 'relationship aspect' of the film, lulling people into thinking this was what they would be getting. Therefore, by the time they had left the cinema and their heads had stopped spinning, they possibly were among the many who simply described 'Vanilla Sky' as a 'mess.' Yes, the story is centres around a print billionaire (Tom Cruise's) slowly falling in love with a struggling artist (Penelope Cruz) while at the same time trying to fend off his existing lover (Cameron Diaz). So far, nothing particularly out of the ordinary. However, once the film gets going (and I say this referring to much that comes in the second half, as the first half sets everything up without giving too much away as to what's about to come) things start taking a turn for the weird.Dreams are mentioned more than once and that's a good analogy as to how the film progresses. Things happens that appear a little random, leaving the audience to wonder whether there may ever be some form of supernatural influence involved. The story chops and changes and deliberately leaves the viewer feeling pretty disorientated, much like you'd feel upon waking up from a particularly vivid dream. Naturally, this form of story-telling doesn't make for an easy ride when it comes to understanding the narrative. I can see it leaving some people a little confused (it took me a couple of watches to actually 'get' the film entirely!).I mentioned 'Lynchian' in my title. This refers to film-maker David Lynch, who's famous for his weird, surreal, completely NON classic Hollywood narrative way of telling a story. He, like 'Vanilla Sky,' likes to leave a fair element of the story up to the viewers' interpretation, rather than spoon-feeding them every plot point. Therefore, this is most likely a film that you're going to find yourself discussing with friends after a viewing (although, in my opinion, 'Vanilla Sky' actually gives you a lot more answers than the average David Lynch film!).If you know what you're in for I think people who are in the mood for a particularly weird and slightly disturbing type of film will quite enjoy this. You definitely have to be in the mood. I've seen it a fair few times, but, if I'm simply craving car chases and shoot-outs, then this isn't the film I put on. I think if anything sums it up best it's Cameron Diaz's performance in 'Vanilla Sky' - on the surface, sweet and frothy. However, dig deep and you'll find dark and creepy (and that's not an insult - she's really good in this!).",Vanilla Sky
27,dromasca,A Strange Combination,7,25 August 2002,"This film is a surprising and strange combination. It starts as a kind of crime psychiatric story, gets fast into the rich-boy-has-all-and loses-all track, drives through many sentimental twisted with Tom Cruise split between the beautiful but brainless singer (Cameron Diaz) and the intellectual true love Spanish dancer (Penelope Cruz) and towards the end turns into something very different that I will not describe in order to avoid writing a spoiler.The film has surprising twists. Its main problem is that it is too long - it could have been a much better film if it was 20 minutes shorter. American directors did not learn that long shots are effective in European movies only because they are backed by psychological depth. Even so, the length of the plot and some of the flat acting (Kurt Russell for example) are compensated by the intriguing development at the end of the movie. As a viewer I was rewarded by the sentiment that I saw something different than the usual banal stuff, even if my patience was badly tried.",Vanilla Sky
28,ThomasDrufke,Life Extension,5,5 April 2017,"I love the unique style and background Cameron Crowe brings to his films. It's like an unexpected mixture of juvenile wonder and adult innocence that appeals to me about his films. Vanilla Sky is by far his darkest feature, but also the one with the least amount of heart and pizazz. In fact, most of it is just a dull mess.Vanilla Sky is an American remake of the 1997 Spanish film, Open Your Eyes. While I haven't seen that film yet, I can imagine it's probably a little more coherent. The remake poses some thought provoking questions and themes, including questions centered around life, death, dreams, guilt, regret, and a few other heavy hitters. But the way in which those themes are covered is less than impressive. It's a poor pun, but perhaps it isn't too surprising that this film feels very vanilla.The performances were great all around, and became the main driving force for my dwindling interest as the film went along. You can see Tom Cruise's passion for this role dripping through the character of David. This may be the best Cameron Diaz has ever been, as the creepy but seductive Julie Gianni. And of course, Penelope Cruz is great as Sofia Serrano. As much as I love their performances, it's difficult to become invested in any of the relationships when the script isn't where it needs to be. It's a dull screenplay that feeds off your attention span, or lack thereof. By that I mean that the film is only as interesting as you make it out to be. It takes plenty of twists and turns to keep your interest enough, but what's the point of a twist if you don't really care where the characters end up?Vanilla Sky is essentially a melodramatic soap opera disguised as a romantic mystery. I wasn't necessarily bored during the film, but it didn't grab my interest the way a film like this should have. Great acting, trippy visuals, and a classic Cameron Crowe soundtrack wasn't enough to save this dreamy picture.+Acting+Poses interesting questions-But takes too many twists and turns for those questions to mean anything-Dull script5.6/10",Vanilla Sky

I guess I'm probably on neither side and I'm just going to say that this movie was okay. There was one thing that I really felt weighed it down. It was too long. There was a time where he took off his mask that I seriously thought the movie would end there. Instead, it kept going! This was a DVD given by a friend for a birthday present. This may be the last movie I ever watch before getting a Netflix account. This movie was perfectly passable. I admit that it got a little predictable. I knew it was going to be that there were dreams involved.It was probably for the best I had no clue what this movie was about. It features Tom Cruise's character as a rich guy who finds a girlfriend and then his ex tries to kill him. Yeah, I didn't see that coming. He survives, but is left disfigured and tries to adjust to life this way. It wasn't that hard to follow but it certainly got weirder as it went on. The acting is pretty good, but I guess it's just not quite the movie for me. I guess it might be because I just saw the ""Agents Of Shield"" episode ""Self Control"" that I saw a much better story of people in a dreamlike state. **1/2",Vanilla Sky

All the characters are amazing, and it will leave you thinking about it for a long time after you have finished watching it, believe me, plus Tom Cruise(especially), Cameron Diaz and Penélope Cruz are all simply incredible in this, and Kurt Russell is amazing!. I have not seen the original Open Your Eyes yet, but I found this film to be simply incredible ,and Tom Cruise delivers another dynamite performance, as he pulled off an incredibly difficult role with perfection, plus I found this film to be extremely creepy for some reason (but in a good way). Cameron Diaz also deserves tons of props with her incredible performance as she was also creepy, and The car crash scene is especially disturbing, plus the ending while confusing was absolutely brilliant as it blew me away!. It's brilliantly made and written, and all the characters are extremely likable, plus Cruise had outstanding chemistry with both Diaz and Cruz. However if you don't pay strict attention you will get lost, as it is a very hard film to follow, and Cruise's smashed up face was extremely creepy but wonderfully done and realistic looking, as I don't know How Cruise managed to pull that off but he did,plus it's very, very complex as well. This movie will especially not be for everybody, as it really is one of a kind film, and is an acquired taste, plus the psychiatric scenes with Cruise and Russell were fantastic. I really loved the incredible angles Cameron Crowe did, and This film has plenty of disturbing and shocking moments as well, plus that mask Cruise had to wear was very chilling. Even at 136 minutes it was never overlong, and I would put this in Cruise's top 5 best performances, plus this should be way higher then 6.8 in my opinion. It's also a brilliant Sci-Fi film as well, and The opening dream Cruise had was really cool, and somewhat creepy, plus I loved the script as well. I will be definitely checking out the original, since I loved this one, and dare I say this should be in the top 250?, plus I think it's quite cool that Penélope Cruz decided to play the same role twice as she played the same role in the original!. Everybody was just perfectly casted, and all the stars look just great, plus while I am a huge Cameron Diaz fan I wasn't sure if she could pull this off or not as it was quite a difficult role, boy did she ever prove me wrong. I don't know if anyone could have played his role as well as Cruise did,and as far as remakes go (even though I have yet to see the original) this is as good as it gets, plus Cameron Crowe proves here why he is considered one of the best directors out there!. I'm going to say anything more, because I want the viewers to go in without knowing anything. This is one of the most incredible films I have ever seen, as it's absolutely mind blowing, with a mesmerizing story, and stunning performances,and if you haven't seen it please do so immediately, every movie buff should watch it!. The Direction is incredible!. Cameron Crowe does an incredible! job here with amazing camera work, outstanding angles, giving it a really dreamy like feel to it and keeping the film at and incredibly engrossing pace.The Acting is simply stunning!. Tom Cruise is amazing as always and is incredible here, he had to play an incredibly difficult role and he did it with perfection he was also extremely likable, very charming, and you will feel for his character and what he is going through, he simply blew me away in a lot of scenes, especially when he is horribly disfigured just his walk, and his reactions it was amazing, he is especially incredible near the end,but fear not Cruise fans that smile will be seen often throughout the film, this is one his absolute best performances! (Cruise Rules!!!!!!!!!!). Penélope Cruz is also incredible here in her scenes as Sofia, she is incredibly gorgeous, very sweet and charming, had outstanding chemistry with Cruise, and was wonderfully energetic I loved her! (Cruz Rules!!). Cameron Diaz is amazing as always and is also incredible here, she is incredibly gorgeous, but also very creepy here, the famous suicide scene with her gave me the chills she was just so convincing, it really shocked me, she also plays the obsessive type extremely well too! (Diaz Rules!!!!!!!). Kurt Russell is amazing as always and is amazing here as the Doc, he is extremely likable intense, had some great scenes with Cruise, I just wished he had more screen time!. Jason Lee is awesome as Cruise's best friend he was funny and intense at the same time I really liked him. Rest of the cast are fine.

35,zkonedog,How Can You Be 100% Sure You Aren't Dreaming Right Now?,7,9 March 2017,"The strange thing about dreams is that, while in one, the dreamer usually does not realize a dream is taking place. Only upon the conclusion of the dream experience is an individual able to distinguish between dream and reality. That concept is the driving force behind ""Vanilla Sky"".
For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on David Aames (Tom Cruise), the heir to a vast business fortune who is very much a playboy. At a party one night, David is smitten by exotic beauty Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz) and begins a relationship with her. When jealous fling Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) finds out, however, she involves David in an accident that will change his life forever. Because this is a ""big reveal"" type of film, I will not say anything more here to prevent spoilers.
There are two primary reasons that ""Vanilla Sky"" is such an extraordinary film:
First, it is very much high-concept. Much like ""Inception"", or ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", this movie deals with dreams and how they affect the dreamers. This plot line is almost guaranteed to make you think while viewing, and it will likely be still rattling around in your brain for awhile after viewing.
Secondly, though, is that a film like ""Vanilla Sky"" can only work if it contains incredible character development, which it indeed achieves. In order to truly appreciate both the ending and the overall journey, both the writing and acting must be spot-on. It is, and as such will leave you feeling as if you truly care about the struggles of David Aames and his world.
Overall, ""Vanilla Sky"" is an excellent concept film that ranks right up there with ""Eternal Sunshine"", ""Memento"", ""The Matrix"", and the like. It even has very much of a romantic aspect for those who enjoy high emotion. Simply put, the only people this movie won't appeal to are those purely wanting action/adventure. This one will make you think, but it is more than worth it in the end.(After a recent re-watch, I dropped this movie down from 10/10 to 7/10 stars. This film has lost a bit of its luster for me in the re-watch process and feels a bit dated. The themes are still interesting and the concept is high, but it has been knocked off the lofty pedestal I once perched it on).",Vanilla Sky

This movie bogs down in its own pretentions. Overdone and overlong, this one confounds the viewer to the very end (when the ""cheat"" ending becomes clear). Tom Cruise cruises through this one like a man truly stunned by the hammer, but it's just not enough. Especially given the aforementioned lamebrained dialogue (which is straight out of some dreadful made-for-tv movie). It's just not an engaging film on any level. Much better was JACOB'S LADDER (although that film, too, punked out in the end with a much-used cheat ending that undermined everything that came before).",Vanilla Sky
37,leplatypus,We can remember it for you wholesale (dvd),10,15 August 2011,"This movie has flavor of this excellent story of my favorite writer, PKD, in the sense that we can't distinguish the reality from the imagination. We can also find the same idea to buy memories and have the tech support to come to help. In addition, the multiple ideal lover is a thematic very Dickien as well.This part gives breath to a movie that was rather a bit dull and dragging: the new Quasimodo life of a rich, egoist playboy is laughable: if the biggest challenge he has to face now is to go out and his biggest fear is that his lover would reject his disfigured, well, he knows nothing about life or love as well. As Penelope says, he really has to ""abre los oyos"".Maybe he deserves his fate after having ""stolen"" the friend of his best friend. But as i done that myself, i think that no red line is crossed because it's among friends not married couples. Moreover, loves needs courage and implies a connection that needs two people to exist, (except maybe in this movie).This fourth aspect of the movie, love, touched me a lot: This movie was simply the one that gets me into following Penelope's filmography: i remember to have just been struck by the trailer, with her cute accent, her smile, the slam of the door and the song. I always thought it was McCartney but i was surprised to learn that it's actually from his rival, Peter Gabriel and it's called ""Solsburry Hill"". For me, this ""electrical meeting"" ranks among the best scene of that kind in movies: the only other examples that come to my mind is ""Lost Highway"" with ""Magic Moment"" (that is a bit alike) or ""Bluest eyes of Texas"" in ""Boys don't cry"". Well, Penelope did such a great performance that she has added at least one more fan with this movie.Actually, I know that this movie is a remake of a Spanish film and as it stars luckily Penelope, i will meet you tomorrow after watching it !

39,funkyfry,Fascinating film,8,4 November 2009,"This was a fun movie to go into ""cold"", not having heard much about it. It seems to resolutely straddle a whole mix of genres, starting out seeming like a straightforward romantic dramedy and eventually morphing into a thriller and then a sci-fi film. It's a film about iconography and personality, the way we see our lives and the way we create a sort of universe for ourselves to live in, but in the Cruise character's case quite literally.Cruise's performance powers the movie, and at times he's very effective. Of course you couldn't find a more suitable actor to play this super-successful and gorgeous guy who's had everything in life. His friend (Jason Lee, who seems so casual that he's distracting) tells him about how you can't enjoy the ""sweet"" without also tasting the ""sour."" It's a simple theme that's developed through the movie in more and less complex ways.The relationship between Kurt Russell's psychologist character and Cruise's masked ""killer"" David is far more interesting and compelling than his friendship with the Lee character, and even perhaps arguably than the central romance between David and Penelope Cruz' Sofia. I really enjoyed Russell's work, and the moment of his self-realization at the climax is one of the most bizarre and effective moments of character acting in sci-fi genre history. The film is littered with fantastic character performances in fact; Timothy Spall and the always-riveting Tilda Swinton are among the best of these.Crowe's direction is less literal than usual, more vague and poetic. I still don't like the way he and his collaborators used music in this movie; I found it distracting. I realize that it was part of the whole idea of the iconography that's creating his world (the clue with the ""Freewheelin' Bob Dylan"" cover was TOO obvious), but the mixture of new and old rock songs makes the film feel like it's old people straining too hard to be cool. All the Radiohead and that type of thing gets very tiring, and the choice of older songs like Peter Gabriel's ""Solsbury Hill"" is too typical. I don't like the way ""Solsbury Hill"" was used for example; I really don't appreciate music with lyrics playing over a dialog scene. I find myself listening too much to Gabriel's fascinating lyrics and trying to figure out if they have any connection to the scene, and I missed half of the dialog between Cruise and Cruz.In the end though, the film is a big winner. It's the type of film that presents a lot of ideas and lets the audience chew them over. We want to know ultimately what is going on, and the climactic revelation manages to still retain some of the original poetry and mystery. That's tough to pull off. Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise have never been better IMHO; the weird sex scene between them towards the end is very disturbing and effective. The film manages to tackle some big ideas in a really entertaining way, and it's a nice film to look at.",Vanilla Sky

I found the way she slotted into this odd movie rather interesting and Penelope Cruz's best performance without a doubt. Tom Cruise not so sure about. He did well but it certainly isn't the one they'll be talking about when he dies (which would be Top Gun and Eyes Wide Shut). Since Kurt Russell wasn't in it for very long at all I did find it hard to make a decision as to whether he did well or not but considering he came in and tried to explain everything yet I was still wondering what was happening I'm going to say it was nothing memorable.

41,dfranzen70,"Never bland, but never terribly interesting (or comprehensible)",3,3 June 2002,"In an era of big-budget, super-duper special effects movies, a lot of people pine for the old days when plot meant something and characterization was key. Well, look what we get. A convoluted, disinterested absurd piece of pablum that's not worth the celluloid on which it was filmed.Vanilla Sky is about a dashing young publisher named David Aames (Tom Cruise) who has two women in his life - his ""buddy"" Julie (Cameron Diaz) and mysterious new woman Sofia (Penelope Cruz), who just happens to be his best friend's girlfriend. David feels he's being stalked by Julie, who wants more than sex, but he can't keep his eyes and hands off Sofia. You can see this is just heading for trouble.Much of the plot centers around a violent car crash in which David emerges with a disfigured face. What happens after that is quite surreal - kind of like floating in a dream in which at once everything and nothing seems to have meaning. Under such circumstances, one can twist logic and reality into whatever one desires (in this case, ""one"" would be the screenwriter). Anything can happen and be justified. That's great, but it doesn't always make for a good movie, just as free association doesn't make for a good novel.To begin with, Cruise himself seems miscast, although ironically so. He's the kind of movie actor who much of the world sees as the cocky, arrogant, preening archetype of male stars, always worried about how they look. And yet here he is with a horribly ugly face - is he trying to tell the world, ""Look, I can play creepy-looking, too!"" No, Tom, you can't.And for at least the third movie, I hear Cruise utter these words, or a variation: ""I've been set up!"" He sure gets set up a lot - see The Firm, this one, and the upcoming Minority Report, to name three. What it all goes back to is his characters' inability to believe they themselves have done anything wrong, ever.Secondly, there's a huge lack of chemistry between any of the three leads, especially between Cruise and Cruz. I'm sure there are legions of people who believe Penelope Cruz is the cat's pajamas, but don't count me among them. I didn't find her particularly attractive or alluring in the movie. I won't waste space picking apart her obvious physical issues, but please - let's not place her on some goddess pedestal. But for a couple that apparently fell for each other off the set, Cruise and Cruz don't seem particularly enamored of each other on it. Yes, they make goo-goo eyes to each other. Snoresville.And that plot! It's one thing to have twists and turns, each leading to more questions and mysteries, and it's quite another to have each twist cancel out the last twist. The movie kept negating itself. I know it was trying to show that the line between dreams and reality can be seriously blurred, but you can't have each scene render the last one irrelevant. Instead of being clever, all this does is confuse and frustrate the viewer.About the only real spark of life comes from David's best friend Brian, played by Jason Lee. And you know, when Jason Lee's the only one making things happen, you know you got yourself a crappy movie. There are supposed heavyweights in this movie - Cruise, Diaz - and your best performance is by Jason Lee of Mallrats and Almost Famous (another Cameron Crowe movie, like this flop)? Geez!I'm glad I didn't see this in the theater, although I might not have been so critical if I had (you know, it's the classic ""I spent $8 on this, so I'm gonna like it!"" rhetoric). I don't think Cruise's career is in any kind of jeopardy, as evidenced by his usual $20 million paycheck. He might want to develop an additional facial expression or two, however.This is a bizarre, pointless movie that seems to take delight in its tortured script, wallowing in its own nonsense.",Vanilla Sky
42,dee.reid,Understand a few things ***SPOILERS HERE IN***,10,24 June 2002,"Cameron Crowe's ""Vanilla Sky"" may not be the total mind bending ""alternative piece of film"" that we may have wanted it to be, but it sure is something to behold. I understand that this film has received quite a number of bashings (not like ""Pearl Harbor"", but even those criticisms weren't that necessary) and an equal amount of praise as well. This is definitely a thinking persons kind of film, though not on the level of something say ""The Usual Suspects"" but is close to being there with an ending where all the missing pieces fall right in. I've never seen the original Spanish film that ""Vanilla Sky"" was based on, so I'm not even going to waste my time making comparisons. I will say that judging from the reviews and the films story, that Cameron Crowe was not trying to outdo that film, but was trying make something close to it that all audiences, not just American could understand. Secondly, there is nothing wrong with the characters in the story. David Aames (Tom Cruise) is not a yuppie jerk, Sophia (Penelope Cruz) is acting no matter what people say, and Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) is not a total nut job because it takes a lot to tell someone that you love them THAT much. For me, the characters make ""Vanilla Sky"" what it is, which is an ""alternative piece of film"", which is what I wanted it to be. The two main female characters in this film, to me, are both direct opposites of each other. They both love David Aames, but in different ways. Sophia loves David only after he has the reconstructive surgery that restores his former beauty. Julie loves him because of who he is on the inside, not because of what his face looks like although ironically she made him like that. There is nothing wrong with the story either. If there are any faults in the story, it's that the science fiction elements in the story aren't that well thought out and that's it. Also, many people are overlooking the fact that as one previous viewer already mentioned, the story is just a series of nightmares and the ending proves this: David was just dreaming. So before you go making snap judgments, sit down and actually watch this movie. Who knows, you may just understand it. I know I do.",Vanilla Sky

Cameron Diaz was playfully wicked as the obsessed lover-friend. The movie's last hour is like something you have never seen in film.  It could be your best cinematic dream or your worst theatrical nightmare. It does get kind of nutty! But then again some of us like our vanilla with nuts and some of us don't. **** Good,Vanilla Sky
44,Chris_Docker,Dares to be different,6,26 February 2002,"A wealthy playboy (Tom Cruise) suddenly finds himself in jail for the murder of the woman he loves. Flashbacks show how he ditches his former girlfriend or `f***-buddy' (played by Cameron Diaz) and falls for another woman (played by Penelope Cruz). He gets in the car with Diaz however and she deliberately drives off a bridge, killing herself and leaving Cruise terribly disfigured. He settles down with Cruz but starts to have what seem like psychotic episodes where he mistakes her for Diaz. The ending is well worth the wait and explains the mystery completely. It's not an incredibly tortuous affair either. Everything is explained, but you have to pay attention  sadly some critics who admit to being `puzzled' couldn't be bothered to do this and it shows painfully in the reviews. There are also some gem-like scenes  for instance when Cruise does a pencil drawing of Cruz early on and draws a wonderful likeness that is at the same time more beautiful than the girl has yet shown herself to be, or the moment when Diaz looks helplessly on as an epitome of sadness  the `girl with the martini'. There are many metaphors that can be drawn about stardom but it is a movie worth seeing for its own story. (Stay for the final credits  you not only get Paul McCartney's beautiful Oscar-nominated title-song, but the haunting melody that it seamlessly fades into and which is sung by Diaz.)",Vanilla Sky
45,juneebuggy,This grew on me with a second viewing,8,29 October 2014,"The first time I watched this (years ago) I just didn't get it, but for whatever reason this time around I thought the story was pretty brilliant. I love figuring things out and there was a lot to wade through here. What's real, what's a dream. Who are the antagonist (s) Is David crazy? Who is Julie Gianni? I also liked how this movie turned into a sci-fi about half way in. Yeah, wasn't expecting that but it worked.Strong performances all around and a lot of whoa, that's cool moments following Tom Cruise as a self indulgent publishing magnate whose life of privilege is changed forever following a car accident.The mask was an interesting prop and I liked the scene where David wears it backwards in the nightclub, freaky. 05.13",Vanilla Sky
46,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,"Thrilling, romantic, and heart-warming romantic thriller",10,19 November 2005,"VANILLA SKY, in my opinion, is a thrilling, romantic, and heart-warming romantic thriller. I thought that Sofia (Penélope Cruz) and Julie (Cameron Diaz) were both very beautiful women... especially in the fancy dresses they wore at David's (Tom Cruise) party. As a matter of fact, all of the costumes were very well-designed. Also, after David's face had been disfigured, it was very hard to tell what was real and what was fake. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""Everyone involved in this film deserves a Golden Globe."" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Tom Cruise, Penélope Cruz, or Cameron Diaz, I highly recommend this thrilling, romantic, and heart-warming romantic thriller, that is, if you haven't seen it.",Vanilla Sky
47,NateWatchesCoolMovies,An ethereal classic of emotion and visual splendour,10,11 January 2016,"Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky leads you on an incredibly picturesque journey into the life of a wealthy publishing heir, played with impressive emotional heft by Tom Cruise. He once had an idyllic life that gave way to some tragic events, and is now in a way station of existential despair, lamenting his sad tale to a sympathetic psychiatrist (Kurt Russell) and daydreaming of his gleaming past. Crowe's films always have an impossibly bright, strikingly beautiful sheen in their composition, displayed here by a distinct urge to forge the melodrama, and melancholy not with dark, muted tones like some craftsmen might, but to keep a vibrantly lit, dreamy aesthetic that never lets go of beauty, even in dark places. Cruise is forced to contend with a jilted, unstable lover (Cameron Diaz) whilst pursuing his angelic dream girl (Penelope Cruz) into realms of thought, feeling and action that ripple through his life like scintillating reflections in a sunlit meadow pond. I'm purposefully being vague and poetic as not to disturb the veil hanging over plot and resolution, for the surprises which lay in wait for you are a riveting rop-a-dope and should be explored with a blank canvas of expectation and complete lack of any previous knowledge about the story. The supporting cast sees very memorable work from Timothy Spall, Jason Lee, Alicia Witt, Tilda Swinton, Michael Shannon, Ivana Milicivec, Johnny Galecki, W. Earl Brown, Tommy Lee and Noah Taylor. Cruise is compelling, finding the confused soul in his creation, Diaz scares wonderfully as the unpredictable live wire, but Cruz steals the show with her usual sweet disposition. This film is based on a Spanish one called ""Abre Los Ojos"" which also starred Cruz in the same role she plays here. This, however, is the superior version, for me a masterpiece and a personal favourite. Crowe makes poetry of light and colour, painting visual splendour that flows flawlessly in tandem with the achingly beautiful soundtrack, another aspect of film he always excels in. And as for the deep well of secrets that is the story? I'll tell you in another life, when we are both cats.",Vanilla Sky

Cameron Diaz what a hottie in this,, and of course Tom's wife Penelope.. is very hott to,, it was said in the special feautures on this disc, that as off 2001 that this is the movie that Tom Cruise is most proud of.. and i can see why,, it's sorta like a dream,, some flashbacks,, kinda like a great riddle or mystery as to whether or not he killed so and so,, or at what point is he dreaming or is it actually real,, what a great movie to see over and over again.",Vanilla Sky
50,alansabljakovic-39044,Mind is an intersting thing,7,10 April 2019,"I don't hate it because it is like most of the mindfuck movies, you don't know what is happening till the end. Well, I love Tom Cruise so this was on my watchlist for years and I finally watched it. Very interesting but messy movie.",Vanilla Sky
51,Agent10,"Better than I expected, considering how bad the trailer was for it",7,9 May 2002,"-contains spoilers-Quite honestly, I was surprised by this film. For some odd reason, Tom Cruise keeps displaying the semblance of acting ability. While Penelope Cruz felt awkward and sometimes out of place, her presence in the film brought an interesting contrast between her and Cameron Diaz. The grounded and self actualized brunette versus the out of touch and promiscuous blonde. Score one for the lovely brunettes of the world! Anyway, the dialogue gave up too much of the ending too early in the film. In my opinion, if the screen writer had made the messages more subtle and cryptic, this would certainly would be a classic in the sense of The Crying Game or The Sixth Sense. Also, I must commend John Toll for his amazing photography. I didn't even recognize his work in the fast paced world of within this film. And one last note, the music, cinematography and the action was amazing at the end of the film when Cruise finally makes his leap of faith.",Vanilla Sky
52,Samiam3,"Needs a few touches, but I enjoyed it",7,20 October 2010,"From my point of view, it is a bit difficult to know how much credit to give Vanilla Sky for integrity or smarts when taking into account that it is a remake of a film which I have never seen (Abre Los Ojos). Cameron Crowe's remake (regardless of what it owes to the Spanish film) has its weak spot but is fairly enjoyable. The movie is part drama/romance part surrealism. Surrealist films are pretty tricky. I like my surrealism to be appreciable and clever (Donnie Darko, Altered States) rather than self- indulgent and disorienting (Mulholland Dr.) Vanilla Sky is a case of the former. It is arty, yet manages to tell a narratively coherent story, which allows for viewer investment. Vanilla Sky can range from funny to frightening and or from cold to touching. It is full of mood swings, and despite the fact that the finished product feels like three movies, it is never dull. (although the ending may be a couple minutes too long)What I like about Vanilla Sky is how it (eventually) acknowledges that the viewer is being put on a borderline of dream and reality. Instead of an 'open to interpretation' scenario, The screenplay comes with a good share of climactic explanation, which enriches the thematic material and the emotion. It is essential that Vanilla Sky be a subjective story. We have to be one with Tom Cruise. Even though he is not entirely a respectable character, we come to understand him by the end. The character, I have no problem with. I was more bothered by the performance. Cruise brings his character to life in a fashion that is too spectacular for comfort. Basically he overacts. This kind of 'kabuki theatre' performance may have been more understandable if Stanley Kubrick was directing. In scene one, he drives through Times square, and there is not a soul to be seen. This I find impressive. It hard to imagine any film production company (not even Spielbergs) having the power to clear and block off one of the World's most famous and busiest commerical areas. (Usually movie companies come to Toronto to recreate New York). For all I know this could have been a digital effect. Either way, it looks flawless.If anything, it just goes to show that Vanilla Sky always has your attention, right from the beginning. To be able to sustain that for two hours in a movie that has a sense of unconventional artiness to it is impressive. It's not a terrific movie, but it has been thought through and executed well enough, that it is recommendable as both a surrealist movie and a emotional drama.",Vanilla Sky
53,triple8,"Wins the prize for ""most completely bizarre movie"".",6,22 August 2003,"SPOILERS THROUGHOUT!!OK-I was really looking forward to Vanilla Sky. It looked interesting in the previews though I went expecting more of a ""final analysis"" type of thing. What I got was something else altogether.This maybe the only movie that I walked out of as confused as when I walked in. The movie made absolutely no sense from start to finish. Yeah, I grasp the general concept but..I've always said there's unrealistic and then there's over the top. (Then there's another category all together-over the top multiplied by six. I think that's where Vanilla Sky is.)Anyway-the final plot was so unrealistic in certain areas and left so many questions unanswered it was almost embarrassing, not to mention unbelievable.This movie really plays games with your head. Just when you think you've got it figured out(the plot, not which girl Tom Cruise is making love to)it morphs into something else entirely. I understand plot twists, I favor movies with plot twists. But vanilla sky is more then a movie with plot twists, it's one long twister.There are so MANY plot twists you can't relax enough to figure out what's going on minute to minute and enjoy the movie. That takes away a lot of the movie's overall power.I think this movie could have been really terrible had it not been for the incredible cast who for some reason decided to do this(sc-fi, for lack of a better term.) Had the movie not been done with skilled actors/actresses like Cruz, Cruise and Diez this could have been not just bad but a joke. In reality though these performers are so incredibly talented they keep you glued to the screen in spite of all the movie's obvious flaws. I think that says a lot more about their acting ability then the quality of the movie.I hate when I see a movie that seems like it could have been done so much better. The question I have is why were so many questions unanswered in this movie? I'd like to know because despite everything I (somewhat) enjoyed this movie.",Vanilla Sky
54,TheOneThatYouWanted,6.5 out of 10,6,2 December 2017,"..like Vanilla Sky, it was televised. Finally - finally - finally got a chance to watch this movie. It was okay. I mean yeah, it does drag in some places and gets repetitive however it is original and interesting. And strangely a little forgettable. I am literally trying to remember how it ends. There is a reveal and explanation part and the character is given a choice but I can't recall what he does. And I'm too lazy to read Wikipedia right now.",Vanilla Sky
55,Sherazade,Poor copy,2,2 June 2010,"The problem with this film is that it's a poor scene for scene copy of the far more superior 'Abre Los Ojos' (Open your eyes) the Spanish treatment. Something was lost in translation and all the artistic part of the superior film was sucked out by the casting of Tom Cruise as the protagonist and Cameron Diaz as well. Penelope Cruz tried her best but she was 100 times better in the original version. I tried to like this film but you're gonna have to forgive me because I watched 'Abre Los Ojos' two hours before I embarked on this horrendous journey known as 'Vanilla Sky.' Rent Abre Los Ojos (Open your Eyes) instead and save yourself from one more Hollywood crap-fest film. My apologies to Cameron Crowe(in case you ever stumble upon my comments), I actually like your other stuff.",Vanilla Sky
56,Seraphion,Really balanced between two powerful genres,7,11 May 2015,"The movie presents a very interesting story, although it's not an original one. Furthermore I really like how the movie marries its distanced genres of romance and science fiction. The movie did a very great job in shifting the focus from the romance side, bit by bit moving it until the grand revelation of the science fiction side. Both of the genres were done quite powerfully. The romance side had its story strong enough with the conflicts coming in and out. The science fiction side feels rather unlikely at first but then gained its significance more and more over time. The acting work is a great overall job. Tom Cruise did his character nicely although his usual grin really bores people down. Cameron Diaz did her part well, having her character suddenly reappearing after the middle point. Penelope Cruz adds her accent very nicely to the romantic side of the story. Having big names like Kurt Russell, Tilda Swinton and Michael Shannon's kind of a cameo, in supporting roles really adds to the movie as a whole.",Vanilla Sky
57,ctomvelu1,Huge disappointment,4,11 November 2012,"Remake of a foreign film, VS is the story of a publisher who has a bad car accident and wakes up to a severely altered reality. The remake is a vehicle for Cruise, who is shown in loving closeup through a large part of the movie. His character stumbles through this altered reality, meeting a beautiful Spanish woman (Cruze) and a sympathetic police psychologist (Russell). He also encounters a strange little man who tries to coax him back into reality. Cruise has always been an acquired taste at best, much like Nic Cage and Keanu Reeves, so your tolerance for this uninspired remake will depend on your affinity for Cruise. What makes the film a bitter disappointment is the last 20 minutes, in which everything that has happened to the bewildered publisher is spelled out in excruciating detail by the strange little man, whose real name is Tech Support (are you starting to get it?). At this point, the film sharply veers away from surreal fantasy into pure sci-fi, and unfortunately its twist ending has been used many times before, sometimes successfully (as in STAY) and more often not. Cruise is simply hammy beyond belief here. If you want to see Cruise actually act, check out the ensemble flick he did several years ago in which he played a horndog motivational speaker. Now, that's acting!",Vanilla Sky
58,philip_vanderveken,Tom Cruise like we don't see him enough,8,1 April 2005,"I'm always on the lookout for the not so average movie. I don't mean things like horror movies with so much gore and blood that it makes it almost impossible to watch, I mean movies that try to be original and which don't seem like you've seen them already 25 times before, even though it's the first time you've seen this movie. Well, Vanilla Sky is such a movie.David Aames (Tom Cruise) is a very popular magazine publisher from New York City. He takes everything for granted: his wealth, his publishing company, his good looks, and most of all his relationships. He's a playboy who spends a passionate night with Julie (Cameron Diaz), ""a friend he sometimes sleeps with,"" and a night with Sofia (Penélope Cruz), a beautiful and smart dancer with a Spanish accent. But than he gets all kinds of strange dreams which may reveal something very important about him, something he never knew...Of course this isn't exactly the easiest of all movies and yes it is quite surprising. Surprising, not only because you get to see Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise in a role you wouldn't exactly expect from them, but also because of the ending. People who prefer easier movies probably don't like this one, but people who are used to watch alternative and European movies, will almost certainly love it. I guess that the main problem which this movie may encounter is the fact that it is a remake of a Spanish movie and only therefore will not be liked by many people on this site. This movie was based on ""Abre Los Ojos"" (or ""Open your Eyes"" in English). Personally I don't really care about the fact if this is a remake or not, but I know that many people do. I guess that's why it doesn't get a very high score, which is too bad really. Personally I give it at least a 7.5/10 perhaps even an 8/10. I really liked this movie.",Vanilla Sky
59,tomsview,Dreamscape Cruise,8,24 September 2013,"""Vanilla Sky"" is a journey into David Lynch territory without David Lynch. The plot for this film is unusual and boundary stretching, and contains more layers than Earth's geological record.The film begins with what could be a series of dreams and then develops into a series of flashbacks and flash forwards. Right from the opening scene, the audience knows the journey will not be an easy one.Tom Cruise's character, David Aames, awakes from a dream, or does he? Open your eyes is the command from his alarm clock and is a recurring theme throughout the movie as well as being the English translation of the title of the original Spanish film, ""Abre Los Ojos"". David is the heir to his father's publishing empire. He seems to lead a life of privilege and wealth despite pressure from the board of directors. David's love life is also privileged; he is having an affair with Julie Gianni played by Cameron Diaz, a beautiful model who seems carefree and independent. Although it does not detract too much from the story, David's role as publisher of three major magazines is rather superficially conceived – a Hollywood stereotype of the publishing world; not much more realistic than the ""Quality"" magazine office in 1957's ""Funny Face"".When David meets Sophia (Penelope Cruz repeating her role from ""Abre Los Ojos""), he becomes infatuated. Another odd touch is the way Sophia and David draw so well, they produce portraits of each other that would have done Norman Rockwell proud, but there is no explanation for their talents. David's affair with Sophia triggers a murderous obsession in Julie who tries to kill David and herself in a car smash. David survives but is disfigured, and his life is dramatically changed. The film takes a leap forward in time to David's challenged future. David is in a mental institution awaiting charges of murder. He wears a full-face mask, which must be said, does not aid audibility. A psychiatrist, Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell), attempts to unravel David's problems.Nearly all the leads play against type. Especially Kurt Russell who brings a great sense of integrity to his role as a psychiatrist. Cameron Diaz also gives her role depth.Tom Cruise plays privileged and spoilt perfectly. During the course of the film his character is assailed with facial disfigurement and a limp. These are the kind of characteristics that can lead to acting with a capital A. From ""Richard III"" to the ""Hunchback of Notre Dame""; actors find it hard to restrain themselves when the heavy make-up is applied and the foot is dragged. Fortunately, Tom only succumbs occasionally to the overwhelming theatrics of it all.Unfortunately, it is the movie that cannot stay the course – before the end, ""Vanilla Sky"" blinks.Unlike ""Mulholland Dr"" where very little is explained, ""Vanilla Sky"" introduces a character, Edmund Ventura (Noah Taylor), to explain things. The explanation is a get-out-of-jail-card. Taylor's character provides a reason for what has occurred – to a point. It is not a totally satisfying resolution. Although the denouement is unexpected and left field, those who hung in there could have expected an ending more in keeping with the human drama that had gripped their imaginations up until this point. The truth is that the script for ""Vanilla Sky"" painted itself into a corner and cheated a little to get out.Despite this, ""Vanilla Sky"" remains a complex, intriguing story that breaks away from easy formulas. It really does deliver something different.",Vanilla Sky
60,uds3,Kubrick would have liked this!,10,21 December 2001,"Not since 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, has a film generated such emotion (both on and off screen). It actually draws parallels with that film, amongst so many others, but we will get to that later! Curiously, it has attracted much the same critical disapproval as Kubrick's work. Seen by many as ""boring,"" ""self-indulgent"" and ""convoluted,""  it is none of these things. It IS however an unapproachably brilliant work of art, from my viewpoint at least perhaps the greatest film ever made and as close to 2001 in depth and visual brilliance as anyone is ever going to get! Cameron Crowe has not ""done"" it for me before, and I really couldn't care if he never ""does it"" again. Kubrickian in stature and mystique he isn't, more like the neighbor you never really got into, and whom you might stumble across in the homewares aisle in your local S-Mart. What he has achieved with VANILLA SKY however is mind-numbing greatness, to which so many people have contributed their very souls.To try to summarise or come up with an encompassing precis of this flick is to undervalue if not trivialise a masterpiece. Its greatness lies essentially in its opening line ""Open your eyes""...the only problem IS, you need to have SEEN the film to realise the staggering implications of what you are hearing. OPEN YOUR EYES of course was the original Spanish film from masterful newcomer Alejandro Amenaber who scaled the heights in Hollywood with this year's THE OTHERS. Rather than identify the film in question, aware viewers may well feel a sense of deja vu here, recalling to mind the line ""Open your mind...open your mind"" which was surely a precursor, if not the inspiration behind both films. Functioning along multiple awareness channels throughout its 153 minute run-time, VANILLA SKY is alternately, intellectually challenging and emotionally involving. Whether you view it as a thriller, a black comedy, outrageous sci-fi or even JERRY MAGUIRE on acid, this is pure brain-drain, a ""fix"" for the fanciful!The opening scenes, as Cruise finds himself in a totally deserted Times Square, seemingly in ""virtual"" impossibility sets the viewer up for what is to follow - a mind-trip through hell and beyond the infinite, literally!!! Think MATRIX, JACOBS LADDER, THE SIXTH SENSE, FIGHT CLUB and one other that I shall sensibly refrain from nominating and yes, they are ALL here, but still the mystery remains!Tom Cruise as millionaire playboy David Aames who inherits 51% controlling interest in his father's publishing empire, is a lost soul. Trouble is, right now he doesn't realise HOW lost! That this is the performance of his career is without question - its the performance of ANYONE's career! Running the gamut of experiences, from smartass yuppie to emotionally decimated and disfigured Joe Blow, the film orbits his character as surely as the planets in our solar system. As his legal advisor, Kurt Russell gives HIS greatest performance too, aided as it is by a script of sheer genius. Cameron Diaz, playing his long-suffering and heartbroken lover of convenience Julie Gianni, turns in one awesomely vivid performance, one that can only end in tragedy - though DOES it? You can never assume that what you see was actually what you think you saw!As for Penelope Cruz, reprising her role as Sophia Serrano in OPEN YOUR EYES, she really is a cutie. The chemistry between her and Cruise is just so obvious and up there for all to see. It is easy to see what Cruise could see in HER that Nicole Kidman could never exude in three lifetimes... at least, I can see it!Like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, the last quarter of an hour will either blow your mind or leave you cold, wondering ""Hmm what was all that about?"" Anyone NOT moved by the Gregory Peck/Bob Dylan revelations (this will make sense ONLY if you have seen this flick) should never have been watching this film in the first place, while the very last ten seconds of VANILLA SKY must wring and hang out to dry, whatever emotions the aware viewer has left, after this movie experience of a lifetime.Yeah, I liked it!",Vanilla Sky
61,DeeNine-2,Transcends the original,9,4 March 2003,"Here in Vanilla Sky, a thoughtful reprise of the Spanish film Open Your Eyes (1997), directed by Alejandro Amenabar, we have Tom Cruise, American heart throb and box office buffo paired with his current true love, the amazingly beautiful and very talented Penelope Cruz.Guess what happens. The public doesn't like him. Even though this is a more finely structured and comprehensible film than Open Your Eyes (we'll get to that in moment), Tom Cruise is NOT sympathetic, or at least it takes us until near the end of the film to feel any sympathy for him, and then perhaps what we feel most sympathetic for is the mask that is Tom Cruise in most of the later reels.I think the problem is that Cruise is miscast. Unlike Eduardo Noriega, who played the same part in the film directed by Alejandro Amenabar, Cruise is too cute and too privileged to elicit our sympathy. We almost feel his character has it coming. After all, he willingly got into the car with his ""stalker"" (Cameron Diaz) presumably to have a little sexual fun. And this just after spending a Platonic night with Sofia (Penelope Cruz), whom he is now supposed to be in love with. Furthermore--and this may be just a minor point, but a telling one--Cruise's disfigurement was not as gross as was Noriega's. One gets the sense that perhaps Cruise insisted on it being that way.From another angle, one might ask, is this deja vu all over again? Recall that Cruise was married to Nichole Kidman when he played opposite her in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. Guess what happened. The public didn't like it. Aside from the fact that they didn't understand it, what they didn't like was Tom Cruise. He was NOT sympathetic. One could not identify with his cruising various kinky sexual opportunities as a privileged married doctor.Having said all that, I still think that this film, directed by the very talented Cameron Crowe, who wrote Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) and wrote and directed Almost Famous (2000), is the better film. Why? Mainly because Crowe demonstrates a better understanding of the underlining theme of the film than did Amenabar. (Of course he had the benefit of Amenabar's film to improve upon.)What I am getting at is the precarious nature of our brain's experience of reality. On one level, I think that is what the film is really all about. (On another level of course there is a love triangle.) Throw the cryonics mumble jumble out the window and consider that we might, as some people believe, become software. As partial products of our own culture we will (at least in the beginning) experience glitches that will destroy our dreams, just as David Aames's guilty conscience destroyed his lucid dream and made him see a projection of his fear and his guilt instead of seeing his beloved Sofia.If we do become software, there will be imperfect matches between our biological nature and the artificial neural nets we will fuse with. We will not be freezing ourselves in the future. Instead we will merge with our machines as we live and become part human and part artificial intelligence--something beyond human. This is the glimpse of the future that Cameron Crowe extends to us, a possibility that he saw in the Spanish language film not fully worked out by Amenabar.Despite his miscasting, I think Tom Cruise gave a spirited performance, and I think only his celebrity and the compromised personality of the character he plays kept some movie goers from fully appreciating his work.Penelope Cruz is more playful here than she was in Open Your Eyes and her role here is somewhat larger. Crowe makes sure she has ample time in front of the camera to mesmerize us, and she does. At some point I realized that she reminded me a little of Audrey Hepburn. Perhaps she has been watching some of Miss Hepburn's films. (I would bet on it.) Regardless, she, whom I first saw in Belle Epoque (1992) when she was eighteen, is utterly bewitching.Also giving an excellent performance is Cameron Diaz as the fatally scorned other woman. She brings a sexy, haunting quality to the part that works well with Cruise's software ""experiences."" She is not quite as convincing a stalker as was Najwa Nimri in the original, however, and this may be another reason that this film only gets 7.0 out of 10 stars from the voters at IMDb while Open Your Eyes gets 7.8.Usually I prefer the original to the remake, the European film to the Hollywood production, but in this case I think it is Vanilla Sky that will be remembered. At any rate, look past Tom Cruise's celebrity and see this for Cameron Crowe whose vision of a virtually real future is intriguing and reveals that he did his homework.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",Vanilla Sky
62,DJAkin,I really liked this movie.,8,22 February 2002,"I saw this movie because I like Tom Cruise.  I feel he is a terrific actor. I never know that Keith Campbell was the actor who was in the scenes where Tom wore a mask and interacted with Kurt Russell.  Anyway, this movie is a love story intwined with some serious sci fi.  Tom Cruise plays a cocky 30 something year old who falls for Penelope Cruise (no relation to Tom......yet).  However, at one point Tom Cruise is in a horrible accident and must learn to live with his face all scarred up and disfigured.  The twists turn like crazy after this.  Jason Lee from DOGMA is superb as Tom's carefree friend.  The acting is great, the music is wonderful and the photography is unbelievable.  The end was criticized by many but I actually liked it.  Yes, this movie does deliver the goods.  7 thumbs up!",Vanilla Sky
63,Screen_Blitz,Unnecessarily convoluted and tedious romantic thriller,6,25 October 2015,"Director Cameron Crowe takes a wild and overly complex turn in this mind-bending thriller that demonstrates the complexity and elements of the human mind that many struggle to understand. Tom Cruise stars as David Aimes, a wealthy, inner city publisher and best friend of Brian Shelby (played by Jason Lee), who is in relationship with beautiful blonde Julie (played by Cameron Diaz), but seems to be in love with a Latino woman named Sofia (played by Penelope Cruz). When David is involved in a devastating car accident with Julie that leaves his face horribly disfigured, he begins struggling to tell between dream and reality. Kurt Russell plays psychology doctor McCabe who has David incarcerated and interrogated him on the events leading up to the fateful car wreck. Mixing elements of science-fiction, mystery, and romance, this film is a remake of the 1997 Spanish film Open Your Eyes, which also stars Penelope Cruz and follows the same story structure. As interesting as the plot and the premise are, I really wanted to like this movie. While I am not saying I hated this movie, there were some major flaws that made this one hard to enjoy. The film sets a promising start with a solid introduction of the characters of Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, Jason Lee, and Penelope Cruz. Then there is the intense car crash scene that leaves Tom Cruise's character with a horrendous facial disfigurement. From there on, the plot takes a whole bunch of of twists and turns that are far too confusing for not only the audience to understand, but the confusing for the film itself. This film tries so hard to be interesting but is completely unaware of the direction its trying to take, and it fails to give any sort of hints to what happens and instead leaves the audience consisting speculating. The plot feels like Cameron Crowe took the script and did some experimenting with it but got everything all mixed up. Throughout the story, there some questions left unanswered and scenes that serve no purpose. The cast's performances are decent, but perhaps nothing too impressive. Vanilla Sky has an intriguing plot and a premise. Overall, this is not a film for everyone and only for those who are fans of Cameron Crowe's works. While it's not totally bad, it would have been better if it the plot was more even and had a better and more structured direction.",Vanilla Sky
64,RNMorton,Surprised I liked parts (at least),7,29 September 2003,"There's so many things about this movie that I don't generally like (recent Cruise, Lee, trick plots) that I'm surprised I actually enjoyed the concept and some of its execution. It gets the thrill of new love right as well as some of the angst of rejection. I confess I tuned out and was ready to write this one off when things got too weird after the accident, but I turned back later and actually enjoyed the wrap-up. If only they could have done the beginning and the end and skipped the middle... Russell is almost always a treat, here in a very underplayed role. I can understand people disliking this movie, and I'm not even sure how I am with the package as a whole, but I was still thinking about it days later.",Vanilla Sky
65,baumer,"Without a shadow of a doubt, the best film of 2001",10,23 January 2002,"Warning: Does contain spoilers.Open Your EyesIf you have not seen this film and plan on doing so, just stop reading here and take my word for it.  You have to see this film.  I have seen it four times so far and I still haven't made up my mind as to what exactly happened in the film.  That is all I am going to say because if you have not seen this film, then stop reading right now.If you are still reading then I am going to pose some questions to you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you think.I remember my Grade 11 English teacher quite well.  His name was Mr. Krisak. To me, he was wise beyond his years and he always had this circuitous way of teaching you things that perhaps you weren't all too keen on.  If we didn't like Shakespeare, then he turned the story into a modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it.  Our class room was never a room, it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book at our own leisure time.  This was his own indelible way of branding something into our sponge-like minds.  I begin this review of Vanilla Sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly etched in my mind, like the phone number of a long lost best friend, and it finally made some sense to me after watching The Matrix.  Now if I didn't know better, I would have thought that the Wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher Mr. Krisak.  But giving them the benefit of the doubt, we'll assume it wasn't him.  But that was the first time this assignment was anything more than impalpable. He had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real.  Show me how you can tell that you are real.  This got the class spouting off all of the usual ideas that I'm sure you can imagine.  Everything from pain, to sense of touch to sense of loss to sense of hunger were spouted off to our teacher to prove to him that we were real.  After every scenario that we gave him, he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless.""What if you are nothing but someone else's dream?""What if you were someone else's dream?  What a messed up question that is. This was a question/scenario posed to us about 15 years ago, before the astronomical use of the Internet and rapid advancement of computers.  How possible could it seem back then?  But if you look at today's technology, now ask yourself, what it you were a part of someone else's dream.Another brilliant but surreal film this year, David Lynch's Mulholland Drive explored similar areas.  But Vanilla Sky goes deeper than any other film could hope to.  In short this is one film that will literally (if you let it) blow your mind from all of the possibilities that surround you.
Open your Eyes.Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a young, hot shot, righteous, full of himself publisher and owner of several magazines.  He inherited this from his father and although he has talent and business savvy, his board of governers, the Seven Dwarfs, think he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They feel he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them.  Early in the film we meet one of David's gorgeous toys named Julie Gianni, played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by Cameron Diaz.  David and Julie play a good game, both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in a monogamous, committed relationship.  This is the type of relationship commensurate with David's other flings he's had in the sexual prime of his life.  And although both talk a good game, we can tell that only one is really telling the truth. 
Next we meet Brian Shelby, played with a stroke of genius by Kevin Smith's good buddy Jason Lee.  Brian is writing a book that David is going to publish but they are also very good friends.  This is something that David has very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film.  Brian has one famous line that he keeps telling David over and over again.  And that is "" the sweet ain't so sweet without the bitter.""  He goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozies who inhabit his bed for a night or two.At David's huge birthday bash, (so huge that the likes of Steven Spielberg wish him a happy birthday) Brian enters with his date, Sofia Sorrano, played of course by Penelope Cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress.  This is a bash by invite only and at first David and Sofia seem intrigued with one another.  And in typical David fashion, despite his best friend being there, he begins to flirt with Sofia.  To complicate things, Julie shows up uninvited and begins spying on David. David then spends the night with Sofia, but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another.  There is no hanky panky.  The next day, as David is leaving Sofia's apartment, he is greeted by Julie, who offers him a ride and from there.......well, I think we have all seen the commercials.That is all I will really say about the plot, because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception.  We are introduced to a character played by Kurt Russel and a few other shady characters that all play a part in this labyrinth like haze.  There is a subtext of death and possible panacea-like cure-alls that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life.  This is just one of the intriguing possibilities the movie offers us, but it doesn't end there.Like many movies seem to thrive on today, this film has a secret.  Sixth Sense may have began this craze, but look even further back and you can maybe thank Angel Heart for starting the craze.  Regardless of how it originated, Vanilla Sky has one of it's own surreptitious gut busters.  And what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies you have just put yourself through.  I have seen this film four times and every time it has been because I want to see if there is something more I can pick up, something more I can understand.  To be able to work your mind in the theater, to enable it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a film.  All of the ersatz so called ""Best Pictures of the year"" have been good but nothing spectacular.  They lack substance.  A Beautiful Mind was intriguing but flat, The Royal Tenenbaums was interesting but uneven.  Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaves you yearning for more yet guarantees your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it.  I know this film has received mixed reviews but I just think that those who don't like it don't quite understand it.  This is what film making is supposed to be like.  This is what a film is supposed to do to you.  It is supposed to make you feel something.  Most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces.  This one isn't.10 out of 10  The best film of the year.  I would love to see this get nominated for best picture and I would love to see Cruz up for best Actress, Diaz for best supporting, Cruise for best actor and Jason Mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor.  Cameron Crowe should there as well. None of this may come to pass, and that is a shame.  This is one film that should not be missed.  And on a final note, I am quite sure Mr. Krisak would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question.  Can you prove you are real?  Or are we just a figment of someone's imagination? Are we artificially transplanted for someone else's bemusement?  This is a film that spawns more questions than it does answers.  And I'm sure that is just fine with him.Open Your Eyes",Vanilla Sky
66,DunnDeeDaGreat,Cruise & Crowe succed again in this masterpiece,8,22 December 2001,Vanilla Sky is a masterpiece of film. Crusie & Crowe had another succesful teaming up in the flick. The cinematography is amazing and the dialouge is unique. Tom Cruise desveres an Oscar Nod for his performance and Penolple Cruz is very sexy in her role. Cameron Diaz is also good. Alll in all this is a good film.,Vanilla Sky
67,vithiet,This was a weird thriller... but I liked it!,7,17 June 2020,"I remember liking it when I saw it way back then and I enjoyed it again upon recent viewing. I never knew it was a remake and still haven't seen the original so I can't compare but Vanilla Sky on its own is a pretty solid movie. It is very strange in its pacing and cinematography but it didn't bother me or felt boring as these exercises in style often do. Great thriller with very good acting performances overall, and unhinged Tom Cruise was the perfect guy for this crazy role in this crazy movie.",Vanilla Sky
68,kevin c,FLAWED MESS BUT WATCHABLE,2,16 February 2004,"Panned by the critics, but I like Crowe. So I gave it a go. I can see where the critics are coming from. It's overlong, and Cruise is not a sympathetic character. It is not in the league of some of Crowe's other work. However I do like the premiss, and it's a good tale for 2001; perhaps I'll catch the remake.",Vanilla Sky
69,mattymatt4ever,"Protracted and somewhat dragging, but overall one overwhelming, truly original motion picture that you won't soon forget",7,16 January 2002,"I was anxious to see this movie, being that I am--and please don't think I'm corny for saying this--a Tom Cruise fan.  I didn't like ALL his movies (didn't care for either of the ""Mission Impossible"" flicks), but he is a real cool actor, and that was made evident ever since his breakthrough role in ""Risky Business.""  Cruise turns in yet another terrific performance. It's a shame, being he is one of the handsomemest men in the universe, that they had to fracture his face throughout most of the film, but I also have to admire him for allowing viewers (especially females) to see him disfigured, proving (like in ""Born on the 4th of July"") that he is not just a glamour guy, just a pretty face, that he is up to taking risks in the roles he chooses.If you've seen the previews, you've seen the first thirty minutes.  And for that, I'm glad!  Because so many previews nowadays practically give away the film.  Anyone who has seen the previews for ""Cast Away"" knows that's true. Though it was a great movie, we sat there for three hours knowing that Tom Hanks would finally survive and return to civilization in one piece.  I won't give away what happens after Cruise gets into the car accident with Cameron Diaz, because the outcome is utterly unpredictable.  Cameron Crowe surprises you with plot twist after plot twist, making you think more and more.  After leaving the theater, I had a totally different view of life. All sorts of questions came into mind.  All those magical ""what if"" questions.  What if things aren't what they seem?  Though the outcome is pure fantasy--created with great imagination--it still makes you ponder what lies in the future.  Maybe this COULD happen.Jason Lee is a scene-stealer, as Cruise's best friend.  I am a great admirer of Jason, but after cringing at his disastrous role in ""Heartbreakers"" I was hoping he could stay in the independent circuit, and not even dream of co-starring in another big-budget motion picture.  But in this movie he plays the role he was born to play--what he's truly good at.  Playing the wise-cracking, intellectual, smart-aleck, know-it-all best friend.  The kind of role that put him on the map in such films as ""Mallrats"" and ""Chasing Amy.""  He is hilarious and brings great comic relief to this moderately depressing story.  So I hope to see him in more movies, small- or big-budget--just be careful how they cast you, Jason.
As for Penelope Cruz--I have to admit, I'm tired of seeing her on screen. I used to think she was attractive, but now I think she looks like a bird. But that's not my main reason for disliking her in this film.  In fact, I didn't mind her (small) role in ""Blow.""  I guess it's because her role was only semi-serious, playing a sex-obsessed cokehead.  In ""Vanilla Sky"" she plays a serious role that seems to have been written for an American, or someone with good control of the English language.  Here, she's struggling through her lines left and right, and the dialogue just doesn't sound convincing coming from her mouth.  Therefore, it's hard for her to convey any true emotion.  I've never seen any of her Spanish films, but she might've acted well in them, being she has great control of her native language.  So I'm not just being cruel.  I'm sorry, but I just find her accent to be annoying and distracting.At two hours and thirty minutes, the movie is too long for its own good and it does drag at times--a few scenes really didn't seem necessary and could've easily ended up on the cutting room floor.  But I guess Cameron Crowe is one of those directors who prefers to stretch out the running time, making sure not a single element is left out.  ""Jerry Maguire"" (also directed by Crowe) was also too long for its own good.  However, I'm still recommending this film because of the mere fact that it's like nothing you've ever seen.  It's the kind of film you won't soon forget and will definitely leave a lasting impact.My score:  7 (out of 10)",Vanilla Sky
70,jhclues,One of the Best of 2001,10,19 December 2001,"How strange the human mind is; this center of activity wherein perceptions of reality are formed and stored, and in which one's view of the world hinges on the finely tuned functioning of the brain, this most delicate and intricate processor of all things sensory.  And how much do we really know of it's inner-workings, of it's depth or capacity?  What is it in the mind that allows us to discern between reality and a dream?  Or can we? Perhaps our sense of reality is no more than an impression of what we actually see, like looking at a painting by Monet, in which the vanilla sky of his vision becomes our reality.  It's a concept visited by filmmaker Cameron Crowe in his highly imaginative and consciousness-altering film, `Vanilla Sky,' starring Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz.  At the age of thirty-three, David Aames (Cruise) inherits a publishing empire left to him by his father. His fifty-one percent controlling interest, however, has made him something of a marked man, as there are seven members of his board of directors, and each deems himself more worthy than the young Mr. Aames of the lion's share of the company.  And fueling the fires of discontent is their perception that David lacks the focus the job requires.Admittedly, David likes to play; still, he's in control of the business and does what he sees fit, whether the board (he refers to them as the `Seven Dwarfs') likes it or not, and no one has ever had the courage to challenge him directly.  But during a lavish birthday party in his honor, one of the corporate lawyers, Thomas Tipp (Timothy Spall) warns David that the seven are up to something behind his back.  At the time, however, it's the last thing on David's mind; he's been having a casual affair with a friend, Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz), but even that moves to the back burner when he meets a woman at his party that he can't get out of his mind.  Her name is Sofia (Penelope Cruz), and after knowing her for only one night, she becomes a pivotal part of his life-- which is about to be turned upside down, as on the morning after his party he makes a decision that will change his life forever.  And he is about to learn that sometimes, there is simply no going back.Director Cameron Crowe has crafted and delivered much more than just another film with this one; far more than a movie, `Vanilla Sky' is a vision realized.  Beginning with the first images that appear on screen, he presents a visually stunning experience that is both viscerally and cerebrally affecting.  It's a mind-twisting mystery that will swallow you up and sweep you away; emotionally, it's a rush-- and it may leave you exhausted, because it requires some effort to stay with it.  But it's worth it.  Think `Memento' with a driving rock n' roll soundtrack and a vibrant assault of colors proffered by the stroke of an impressionist's brush. There's darkness and light, and sounds that pound and drive until you can feel the blood rushing through your veins and throbbing in your brain. And all played out on a landscape of virtual reality swirling beneath that ever expanding vanilla sky.  Simply put, this one's a real trip; it's exciting-- and it's a mind bender.As to the performances here, those who can't get past the mind-set of Tom Cruise as Maverick in `Top Gun,' or his Ethan Hunt in `Mission Impossible,' or those who perceive him only as a `movie star' rather than an actor, are going to have to think again in light of his work here.  Because as David Aames, Cruise gives the best performance of his career, one that should check any doubts as to his ability as an actor at the door.  He's made some interesting career choices the past few years, with films like `Magnolia' and `Eyes Wide Shut' merely warm-ups for the very real and complex character he creates here.  And give him credit, too, for taking on a role that dispels any sense of vanity; this is Cruise as you've never seen him before. `Jerry Maguire' earned him an Oscar nomination, and this one should, also-- as well as the admiration and acclaim of his peers.  Cruise is not just good in this movie, he is remarkable.Penelope Cruz turns in an outstanding, if not exceptional performance, as well, as Sofia, the woman of David's dreams.  There's an alluring innocence she brings to this role that works well for her character and makes her forthcoming and accessible, yet she lacks any hint of mystery that may have added that special `something extra' to the part.  But Crowe knows how to get the best out of his actors, and he certainly did with Cruz.He also knew what he was doing with Cameron Diaz, who is absolutely vibrant in the role of Julie.  She's never looked better, and fairly sizzles on screen.  But make no mistake, this is no `window-dressing' part, and Diaz delivers a complete package with this character.  The quality of her performance can be measured, in fact, in the impact she makes with rather limited screen time.  And it's the persona she integrates so fully with her innate beauty that makes Julie so unforgettable.  Overall, a terrific job by Diaz.The supporting cast includes Kurt Russell (Dr. McCabe), Jason Lee (Brian), Johnny Galecki (Peter), Armand Schultz (Dr. Pomerantz), Noah Taylor (Ed), Mel Thompson (`L.E.' Man), Jean Carol (Woman in New York) and John Fedevich (Silent Ed).  About half-way through, this one may have you questioning your own sense of reality; but rest assured, by the end of `Vanilla Sky' all will be revealed.  It's a reality-bender, to be sure, and a wild one; but this is exciting entertainment that offers a satisfying-- and unique-- experience, one you have to see to believe.  It's the essential, and absolute, magic of the movies.  10/10.",Vanilla Sky
71,aciessi,What?,5,20 July 2015,"Vanilla Sky is what happens when a great director wins an award, gets surrounded by Yes men, and gets the opportunity to have full reign of his dream project. This has vanity project written all over it. It's just gobbledygook. I understand why people hate this movie. Cameron Crowe really didn't care if this movie polarized his audience, and it astoundingly did so. But, the people that liked it, to my estimation, either looked into it too deeply, understood it's intentions or just laughed at how utterly incomprehensible it was. I gave it a chance, and I was oddly entertained by it. At times I couldn't believe what I was watching, but I had to keep going. I feel aggravated, but accomplished for having watched it. Cameron Crowe has unfortunately never made a decent movie again after this. You can see that it's his tipping point. Pretension and sticky saccharine gloop practically are pouring out of the seams, about to burst. I'd like to get a Life Extension, and dream that Cameron Crowe still makes good movies like Almost Famous.",Vanilla Sky
72,CharltonBoy,Odd but interesting.,7,27 December 2002,Tom Cruise has done his career no harm over the last 3 years with the choice of films he has decided to do and Vanilla Sky is no exception although it's by no means his best. This is an odd film that is confusing for the most part but it's not a film that you can say is dull. It does have you guessing right to the end as to what is happening. Is he dreaming? Is he going mad? Is it actually happening? In the end the answer didnt really matter as the film was unique and highly watchable and very well acted.

73,carbuff,Tom really surprises me.,9,11 May 2015,"Wow, I really didn't think that Tom Cruise was actually capable of carrying a heartfelt movie. My opinion is that this is the best movie Tom Cruise has made so far. I actually only decided to watch this because I'm a car guy, and I knew that this movie had a Ferrari 250 GTO in it (turns out it's a replica). Interestingly, there were also quite a few other nice classic cars in the movie, such as a 1960s fastback Mustang and a Volvo 1800ES shooting-brake. It's a well-written and complex story that comes together at the end, but I don't want to give anything away, so I'm going to stop there. Normally, Cruise is a charismatic and energetic ""Movie Star,"" but not a particularly compelling or convincing actor, and until the end this formula was holding true, but then, for lack of a better word, the film blossoms. The way I would categorize this movie is that the French should have made it, but until they do, the American original will do nicely.",Vanilla Sky

But it did not end there and it became too long, because the moral of the film had already been named and the mystery had been solved. Good acting by Cruise and Cruz. I generally do not like Cruise that much (too much smiley, happy, slick guy) but he was good here. My absolute hero in this film: Jason Lee. HE RULES. Whenever I see him I must laugh. HE IS SO COOL.

Whilst the picture is often entertaining, it is confusing and uneven in parts and I had the impression that much of the film was made up as it went along even though at the end that was unlikely to be the case but that was the impression given to me. On the plus side....nice music, good special effects though the Spanish actress seem to be there more for her looks than talent. It is true that as the story unfold various ""clues"" are given as to where the plot is going but unlike for instance Matrix which can be said to be in the classic category, Vanilla Sky is a victim of its own confusion and that dilutes much of what ought to be a thought provoking theme.

78,itamarscomix,I like it more than I should,7,26 December 2011,"Vanilla Sky is, obviously, a very unnecessary film. Hollywood's ever growing tendency to hijack every somewhat successful foreign film and remake it in English for the local market is one of the worst diseases of the American film industry; this remake of Alejandro Amenábar's excellent Abre los ojos - made only three years after the original's release - is, by its conception, no better than any of them.And yet - and yet, I like Vanilla Sky. I can't say that I like it as much as Abre los ojos, but that's mainly because it lacks the element of originality. Some elements aren't as strong as the original, and there's definitely a Hollywoodian feeling that distracts, but the remake has many strengths as well - other than the obviously bigger budget, the biggest advantage it has is director Cameron Crowe. Crowe adapted the film nearly word-for-word and shot-for-shot, but he lent it his own style, his own penchant for pacing, and of course an excellent soundtrack which includes artists as varied as Radiohead, The Monkees, Red House Painters and Sigur Rós. Crowe's smoother, more elegant approach is just as appropriate for the story as Amenábar's grittiness, if not more, and it's actually quite refreshing to see these two different approaches to an almost identical film.Tom Cruise also does a surprisingly good job. While Jason Lee and Kurt Russell don't quite work out in their roles, I actually liked Cruise better than Eduardo Noriega in the lead. Cruise lends the role the same airheaded, self-important naiveté he had in Jerry Maguire, to darker results, and supplies one of his better performances. I also liked - nay-sayers be damned - the increased emphasis on the sci-fi elements, which work as a truly surprising turn when they finally appear.Vanilla Sky isn't as complex or intelligent as Abre los ojos. Instead, it's more stylish and more dynamic, and as a film by its own right, it works just as well. Despite the many similarities these are two different films, and I like them both.",Vanilla Sky
79,FilmOtaku,A worthy remake,7,28 March 2005,"""Vanilla Sky"", Cameron Crowe's remake of the 1997 film ""Abre los Ojos"", written and directed by Alejandro Amenabar, had two potential strikes against it from the onset: It was a remake of a film that was made four years prior, and it was a remake of a film where the original reeked of sheer genius. Luckily, Crowe was able to overcome these two hurdles and make a solid film that stands on its own merits.""Vanilla Sky"" centers around David Aames, (Cruise) a spoiled rich kid who has inherited his father's vast wealth and publishing empire. David is an attractive man (and knows it) who lives a jet-set lifestyle that involves having as much fun as possible in every given moment. Julie Gianni (Diaz), a girl with whom he has a casual ""sleeping arrangement"" is not able to subscribe to this lifestyle and when she tries to glean more from the relationship, is cast aside. On the night of his birthday party, David's best friend Brian (Lee) brings his new friend Sofia (Cruz), and the two develop an instant connection. In an attempt to get away from the now stalkerish Julie, the two escape to Sofia's small apartment and proceed to have a wonderful, meaningful evening together wherein David's life seems to have changed for the better. On his way out the door, he runs into Julie, who has followed him to Sofia's apartment, and she convinces him to drive with her so he can ""make it up to her"". What happens during the rest of the film is a mixture of intrigue, murder and romance, at times blossoming and others faltering, and eventually becomes a race for David to find out the truth about what is really happening with his life and those who are involved in it.I didn't want to get too spoilerish with the plot summary, because although the trailer for the film don't hide a lot in terms of plot points, some things that happen are still more shocking when you simply see them for yourself. ""Vanilla Sky"" has an intriguing and interesting plot that sincerely kept me guessing until the last five minutes of the film, something I was not expecting from a Cameron Crowe film. Cruise's David Aames is like Jerry Maguire if he was even more of an asshole in the beginning; charming, but so self-centered he practically leaks smarminess from his pores. I actually didn't think Crowe had it in him to produce such a well-executed psychological drama, but ""Vanilla Sky"" is a very good film. Once again, Crowe shines with his use of music, something that he has never faltered on. From ""Say Anything"" to ""Almost Famous"", he has exhibited the uncanny knack to take a song that is either historically beloved in its own right or one that one would never think to use in a particular film, and insert it into a scene that is so fitting that the song and scene become married to one another immediately. He did this with Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes"" in ""Say Anything"", he did it with ""Tiny Dancer"" in ""Almost Famous"" and the great musical moment (in my opinion) in ""Vanilla Sky"" was near the end when ""Good Vibrations"" by the Beach Boys is playing over a semi-chaotic scene. I'm not sure if this is one of them yet, but Crowe's knack for turning simple scenes into iconic moments in film is staggering and admirable.The acting in ""Vanilla Sky"" is decent enough, none of it was really a stretch for Cruise, and Jason Lee was his usual laid-back self. The surprising performances for me personally were Cruz and Kurt Russell, who played a court-appointed psychologist. I'm not a fan of Penelope Cruz, but I found her casting to be absolutely perfect (not a stretch since she reprised her role from the Amenabar original). She was cute and quirky, but her vulnerability was so subtle that anytime I felt any kind of emotion, it was usually in response to a scene she was guiding. Also, Kurt Russell, a mediocre actor at best, was great as the psychologist; his strength and warmth are so low key that when a significant plot point about him is revealed at the end, you almost have to slap your forehead in an ""Oh yeah!"" reaction.I really enjoyed seeing ""Abre Los Ojos"", and I think that it still has advantages other than its originality over ""Vanilla Sky"". But when gauging a film like ""Vanilla Sky"", a film that can be criticized as being Hollywoodized, bastardized and super-sized, it is a testimony to the film and filmmakers that it came out as good as it did. Being a foreign-film and independent film lover, I'll always like ""Abre Los Ojos"" thismuch better, but ""Vanilla Sky"" is a worthy remake. I highly recommend both. 7/10 --Shelly",Vanilla Sky

I was lost for a good part of the film and only the beauty of Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz kept me interested. I wasn't terribly impressed with Tom Cruise in this one and he's usually very good.

And if so, can we awake in a dream to figure out, that all around us is just an illusion, cleverly constructed by our sub conscious?Those couple questions sprung in my mind after I watched Vanilla Sky. It's rather interesting movie really, but it does have very poorly written and boring beginning as a romantic drama starring Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. Story it self turns good after the car crash. Then it really starts to examine reality if David Aames (Tomi Cruise), who gets his face mashed up, but who still manages to find love of Sofia Serrano (Cruz).Cruz is great as she always is. You just gotta love that accent. Other actress deserving praise is Cameron Diaz, who play Julianne Gianni, a occasional lady friend of David. She was amazing in that part. Tom Cruise became good actor after he made ""Eyes Wide Shut"" for Stanley Kubrick. That was the movie, which proved, that Cruise can act besides just being a pretty boy. That was just to say, that Cruise does helluva good role as Aames in Vanilla Sky. Could say, that he manages to keep the movie in surface.Oh, and Kurt Russel does nice job as Aames's psychiatrist McCabe. Now to the weak points of the movie. As I said it is partly very weakly written, especially the beginning, which is just boring and mundane. Then there is the direction of Cameron Crowe. He honestly isn't that great. He's not bad, but there are several moments in the film that could do some tightening up, I refer on the beginning here.Overall a decent movie. Above average.",Vanilla Sky
84,Christian_Dimartino,I actually liked it.,7,9 July 2010,"Tom Cruise returns in Cameron Crowe's Vanilla sky. I've been hearing about this movie for years. But nothing about it has been good. Vanilla sky reunites Tom Cruise with director Cameron Crowe, who did Jerry Maguire, a film that is far better and Crowe did Almost famous, which is his best film to date. Everyone hates this movie. Except me. I actually kind of liked it. It was confusing, but interesting, and trippy, and well acted. Though lots of things are left out of explanation, I still kind of liked it. But coming from Cameron Crowe, it is kind of a disappointment.Tom Cruise does well as a publishing tycoon who thinks he has it all. Until he meets Sophia(played by Penelope Cruz). The two begin to see each other. But things go out of control after Jane(played excellently by Cameron Diaz),a jealous former lover, get in a car accident. From here on, the plot gets harder to explain.I can't really describe this film. It's beyond words. It has it's flaws. For one thing, things are explained, but not well enough. Two: some of it doesn't make sense. Three: The film goes off the rails. But I am still recommending it.Why? I liked how trippy it was. I liked how complex it was. The acting was good, especially from Cameron Diaz. It's highly original, But yet I can only give it a B because you aren't positive about it. You don't fully understand it at the end.

85,Movie-12,excellent filmmaking supported by excellent performances. ***1/2 (out of four),8,26 December 2001,"VANILLA SKY / (2001) ***1/2 (out of four)(WARNING: Depending on what you already know about the film--this article may contain a spoiler. It does not, however, give away the ending.)By Blake French: Excluding setting and soundtrack differences, ""Vanilla Sky"" is very similar to ""Open Your Eyes,"" the 1997 Spanish production it is based on. ""Open Your Eyes,"" Alejandro Amenábar's existential thriller, questioned the realm of reality as it combined the filmmaking styles of Stanley Kubrick and David Lynch. ""Vanilla Sky"" blends the thematic depths of the same directors, but the styles of the two movies feel worlds apart. Director Cameron Crowe adds his own ingredients to this complex recipe; his version is more of an update to the original film than a remake.    With heartwarming movies like ""Almost Famous"" and ""Jerry Maguire,"" we never would have expected a film like ""Vanilla Sky"" from Cameron Crowe. But he expands himself far beyond our expectations with this complex, enigmatic, wonderfully frustrating tale. It's a side of Crowe we have never seen before, and it is a pleasant change of pace.The film opens with one of the most impressive sequences filmed all year. David Aames (Tom Cruise), sprints down a barren Times Square, frantically searching for any sign of life-but there is none to be found. No digital effects were used to create this shot. The city actually gave ""Vanilla Sky"" permission to shut down Times Square one Sunday so that the shot could be completed. It has an eerie, frantic sensation that digital alterations would not have accomplished.  David wakes to his luxurious life of wealth and position. He inherited a massive corporation from his father and has been enjoys his power and endless supply of beautiful women ever since. However, his latest bed-buddy, Julie (Cameron Diaz), gets a little too close for his comfort. When she invades his birthday party, David uses his best friend's gorgeous romantic interest, Sofia (Penélope Cruz), as a means to rid himself of her.The following morning, David finds Julie waiting in her car outside his apartment. She admits to following him, but somehow manages to coax him into her vehicle. In a jealous rage, she admits to loving him, accuses David of using her for casual sex, and drives the speeding car off a bridge, killing Julie and deforming David. But is Julie really dead? Is Sofia even a real person, or is she just a figment of David's imagination? David tries to sort it all out in a prison where he has been charged with a murder he does not remember committing.  Cameron Crowe fails to breathe life into a few areas of need, where the original film also lacked. For instance, despite engaging performances, we are never convinced that David and Sofia really love each other. The movie lacks passion. We never feel steam or heat from the screen, not even during an especially absent love scene between Cruz and Cruise. The attitude here is much too external; it questions reality, but never emotion.Also, the movie never shows us the emotion behind David's plastic mask, which he wears to shield his disfigured face. There is a striking scene in a dance club where David wears the mask on the back of his head, making it appear as if he has two faces. A fine metaphor to examine David's vanity, but ""Vanilla Sky"" does not provide the proper foundation.Luckily, this isn't a movie about passion or emotion, it's about conviction and ideas. It's excellent filmmaking the whole way through, supported by excellent performances. Despite his status, Tom Cruise allows himself to look hideously deformed after the car crash. His powerful character transformation is even more effective. He swings back and forth between bitter depression and tormented rage. The psychological inconsistencies are the centerpiece of the movie. And Crowe does expand on other areas where ""Open Your Eyes"" failed. ""Vanilla Sky"" creates a style twice as engaging as the original. Crowe dazzles us with brilliant editing and a lively, pop-culture soundtrack that gives the movie a modern edge. Even so, the twist at the end of this movie feels even less appropriate than in the original, perhaps because the film feels so modern. ""Vanilla Sky"" is not like ""Mulholland Drive,"" where no answers are given and there is much room for individual interpretation. This movie does provide an explanation-but it's without foundation or reason. We initially question the answers provided because we expect something more revealing, taut, perplexing. No need to look any deeper than face value. This movie explains every last detail in the finale, and the more it insists on explaining, the less interesting it is. Despite a disappointing conclusion and a lack of emotional exploration, ""Vanilla Sky"" ranks as one of the best remakes of the year. The movie does exactly what remakes are supposed to do. It pays dues to the original while expanding on the concepts and themes. ""Vanilla Sky"" is not better than ""Open Your Eyes,"" but at least it's on the same par.",Vanilla Sky

87,FlickJunkie-2,A mind warping experience,9,23 August 2002,"Cameron Crowe's dark remake of Alejandro Amenabar's 1997 Spanish film, `Abre los ojos' (also starring Penelope Cruz) is a mind warping experience. Welcome to a world where dreams and reality are seamlessly interwoven, so it is impossible for the characters, the viewers and maybe even Crowe to tell where one ends and the other begins.  This will be a frustrating film for anyone who hopes to make sense of it.  To enjoy it one must relax and allow oneself to be mentally flagellated for two plus hours.Like all lady or tiger stories, the film will generate great debates among the intelligentsia about which parts of the story are real and which are the dreams.  However, for the majority the response will be, `Huh?'  Crowe keeps us guessing until the very last frame at which point he throws us the final curve and abruptly ends the film.  In the featurette that comes with the DVD, it is clear the Crowe is relishing his role as tantalizer, taking great pains to make each scene as ambiguous as possible to keep it open to multiple interpretations.  That's what makes the film fun, if you like that sort of thing.  Personally, I like closure, but I can appreciate Crowe's deliciously evil intentions.As is always the case with Cameron Crowe, the presentation is innovative and visually interesting.  Crowe has a terrific and unique way of crafting his films that is very engaging.  In this film, he purposely avoids defining his characters, preferring to keep their motivations abstruse.  For him to maintain the vagueness, it is important that we remain confused about the characters' personalities.  In this regard, he succeeds spectacularly.  The film is a bit too long and bogs down slightly in the middle, but just when we are about to get bored, Crowe throws us another brain bender to keep it interesting.Kudos go to the makeup department in the creation of Tom Cruise's facial disfigurement, which is realistically hideous and effective.The acting ranges from good to great.  This is a particularly difficult film for actors since the characters are meant to remain indistinct.  It is hard to render a character when the director demands that his/her motivations and personality keep changing, but the cast adapts beautifully.  Tom Cruise is powerful and tortured as Aames, the convoluted protagonist.  Since the entire film is essentially shot from his perspective, it is important that we share his bewilderment and consternation, which means he must project those emotions onto us.  This he does with extraordinary effect, delivering a gut wrenching performance that takes him (and us) to the brink of insanity.  Penelope Cruz is excellent as his sexy and supportive love interest.  But Cruz is eclipsed by Cameron Diaz, who steals the show with minimal screen time.  Diaz swings from sweet and adorable to vicious and maniacal with such ease that it is frightening.  Jason Lee is also good as Aames' fickle best friend and rival.  Lee naturally projects a trustworthy persona, so when he turns on Aames it creates the startling effect that Crowe wants.  Kurt Russell is okay as the psychologist, but this is a more cerebral role than his skills can handle.  Russell is a naturally visceral performer, great in roles as the tough guy with a big heart.  Here he seems a bit out of place.This film is deviously crafted and expertly presented with deft performances by the cast.  It will drive most viewers a little nuts, which is its intention.  This will also mean that some people will really dislike it.  I rated it 9/10.  If you think you can figure it out, you're dreaming.",Vanilla Sky

David survives the crash, but is left with a disfigured face. He is then charged with the murder of Julie.

In the movie they all put off different things about there characters, like happiness, sadness, angry, etc. really well.

The beginning may be slow, but soon you'll be on the ride of your life.Tom Cruise is David Aames, multimillionaire playboy. He inherited three magazines from his late father, and lives the high life. He's friends with Brian (Jason Lee) and keeps up a strictly play relationship with Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz). Soon, however, Brian introduces Sofia (Penelope Cruz) to David, and Julie's upset, so what's to do? Drive off a bridge and kill herself, while just injuring David. His life, however, becomes a mix of reality and imagination, between dreams and actual happenings.If you want a light, easygoing, crowd pleasing flick that gives you all the answers and wraps the ending in a nice little package with a bow and express ships it to your heart, don't look here. If, however, you want an intellectual film that's both straightforward and confusing, this is a good movie. From swift camera movements to perfect modern music, this movie has it all.Tom Cruise (who, when in his mask and for a lot of the film, reminded me of Kevin Bacon in Hollow Man) did a good job of being a cocky millionaire who gets everything. Of course, to do that, he doesn't have to act much. Cruz, who starred in the original Abre Los Ojos, which this is a remake of, also worked well and had chemistry with Cruise. Diaz, although her part was small, did the best she could do, which was a lot. Kurt Russell, who plays a shrink, did a great job, too, but I wish he was billed before Diaz, because he had more screen time.I really wish I had more to say about Vanilla Sky, but there isn't. I found myself liking this experience more each minute. It did start off slowly, but soon gained pace. I do wish, however, that I could more easily tell between David's dreams and reality.

It actually was a bit of a mess, but also a daring, thrilling and interesting mess. Anytime a filmmaker decides to work in the area of dreams/reality/dream state - they can become lazy because of the freedom this genre allows. Something not quite making sense - something not quite pulled off??? Oh well - it's a dream. I can totally understand how Cruise would see the original and think., ""Man, I could play the hell out of this guy"" and he does. Cruise gives a good performance and this remake is actually better then I thought it would be but...(SPOILERS AHEAD+++++++++++++++++++++++++YE BE WARNED+++++): ...THE WAY EITHER CRUISE AS A PRODUCER OR CROWE OR THE STUDIO insisted on how things MUST be explained (and overexplained) for that matter, is insulting to adult audiences. The Spanish film laid it out there for YOU to decide what really happened and this film should have done the same. But obviously someone said NO - we must explain - we must paint a sign for the audience so that ends up being quite a letdown. The film is very well cast and Cruz (who is never as good in English as she is in her native tongue) probably gives her best performance in a Hollywood film (of course she's already played this girl in the original and she is as sparkling in this one as in Amenabar's version). The real surprise is Cameron Diaz's work. The role is a bit underwritten (or maybe trimmed down in the final cut) but she really gives dimension to what could be the one-note psycho stalker. When you think of her work in Being John Malkovich, Charlie's Angels and now this - she really shows she can bring good work to almost any kind of film : art house, action blockbuster, etc. By reading some of the other comments, i can see that many people don't want to be challenged by a film, they don't want to have to do any work as they watch a film, and that's fine. I understand that. But carp about it when a film DOES try and make you think. There are plenty of other mindless films out there, God Knows, so when movies like Lantana, Vanilla Sky, Innocence or even Mulholland Drive try and work outside the normal constraints of Hollywood movie making, give them a tip of the cap. My one other complaint with Crowe (who I admire very much) is he really has to stop with the wall to wall rock song soundtrack. We all know his Rolling Stone Magazine background, we know his wife is Nancy Wilson Heart, but there were many moments in Vanilla Sky where you DID NOT need a song to remind you what feeling might be needed. It was a bit much - trust a scene to work without the pop song hook. 6 out of 10 stars but worth a viewing.",Vanilla Sky

And in this film, we indeed open our eyes to the bizarre and intriguing life of millionaire David Aames.",6,12 June 2002,"Its a fantasy, so even if there are many unrealistic and silly moments, they can be excused. Solid (bordering on strong) performances, excellent direction and a generally clever script make this film one of 2001s most pleasant surprises.The film doesnt quite match Crowes previous effort, Almost Famous. It lacks the Oscarcalibre performances, the script isnt as well written and not every character is well developed. But he has still made a thoroughly entertaining and sometimes debatable film with quite a few memorable scenes.Here, Tom Cruise (Aames) makes the transformation from action hero to eventually troubled millionaire, and he actually does it quite well. While he occasionally overacts and seems nervous at times, he still does a fine job, even allowing us to sympathize with his character. It seems that, like in Jerry Maguire, Crowe knows how to get a good performance from the actor. Cruises current reallife love interest Penelope Cruz also gives a good display, mixing radiance with surprising effectiveness. Most of the stronger parts of the film feature her and Cruise, and chemistry between them is (unsurprisingly) strong. Meanwhile, Cameron Diaz is at ease in her overthetop, if slightly small role. These roles seem to suit her well, and she plays this one to great effect. Other notable performers are Jason Lee as Davids friend, Kurt Russell as a mildmannered psychiatrist, and Noah Taylor as a mysterious stranger. The film has many surprises. You feel involved in nearly every scene, and most of the time, you cant tell whats coming next. The final twist to the story is indeed unexpected, even if it is a bit too bizarre and causes the film to drag on longer than it should. Also, the film is maybe a little too sentimental at times, and the scenes dont always link clearly together. Thankfully, Crowe manages to prevent the film from becoming a mess. Set design is attractive, and the music, which includes the use of songs by R.E.M. and Paul McCartney, blends in well.I think calling this a masterpiece would be going a bit too far (its problems are all too visible, notably the slightly confusing beginning and overlong end), but this is a wellmade and constantly involving film which shouldnt be missed.",Vanilla Sky
98,moviemanMA,"So much to say, but I am speechless...",7,11 July 2005,"Cameron Crowe has written and directed some pretty good movies over the years. Starting with Say Anything in 1989, Jerry McGuire in 1996, and Almost Famous in 2000. But these movies don't compare to the complexity and splendor that is Vanilla Sky.In this American version of Abre los Ojos, Tom Cruise stars as David Aames, a rich publisher, thanks to his father, who has it all. His ""buddy"" named Julie (Cameron Diaz) is a little jealous about him meeting this girl at a party named Sophia (Penelope Cruz), who he was introduced to by his client and best friend Brian (Jason Lee). Brian is falling for Sophia but is sort of OK with Daivd making the first move. Julie becomes jealous and crashes her car with David in it. She dies and David is left disfigured. Basically, David's entire life is starting to turn upside down and doesn't even know what is real and what isn't. Intertwining throughout the movie is David talking to Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell) in prison, awaiting his sentence for a crime he doesn't think he committed. What happens next is hard to explain, and also would ruin the movie.This movie couldn't have been written any better. Cameron Crowe is on the top of his game. This smart, entertaining story of what happens to a man when reality seems to slip away is magnificent. The five main characters are phenomenal. Cruise, Cruz, Diaz, Russell, and Lee all give some of their best work to date. Although the plot seems to be confusing at times, Crowe does a nice job of explaining everything so it all ties together nicely. Vanilla Sky is a masterpiece. The screenplay is reminiscent of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Everyhthing put together makes Vanilla Sky one hell of a ride. ""This is a revolution of the mind...""",Vanilla Sky
99,supertom-3,What the hell? wow!!,8,1 February 2002,"How could you best describe this film? I say highly surreal at times, down right weird and do you know what? it was captivating, I left the cinema screen and since that time the film has stayed in my head. It has a David Lynch and Cronenberg quality about it, in that you never really know what is supposed to be real and what isn't at certain points in the film. All the performances are great, particularly the three leads, Cruise, Cruz and Diaz and for me like many critics the sexy, gorgeous, Cameron Diaz narrowly steals the show. You really must see this film, I love the fact that it has stayed lodged in my brain as I try to work out certain parts of the film. It is really strange, but it is wonderfully shot and excellently acted. Occasionally this film seems like a music video and at other times an advert for a phone company or something, and most of the film I was left with a look of bemusement but in a good way like with films such as Fight Club or Videodrome, just two that come to mind. Where this differs from some others of this sort of confusion based film is that it gives you an answer as to what is going on at the end which you won't see coming until quite close when they hint at it, but then you still are left doubting whats happening thanks to the rest of the movie. I really like this film despite the fact it annoyed the hell out of me, but it did so with good intention unlike some movies that annoy purely because they are bad. I recommend this definately, it stretches the rules of movie making to its limits and leaves you in a daze, some may dislkie this sort of film but I like many love the effect a film like this gives you. I think the director Cameron Crowe achieved what he set out to do, leave the movie in your thoughts long after you've left the screen. This gets an 8/10 it would get a ten but the twist could be seen as perhaps a mixture of ""thats a good one"" and ""yeah right!""

100,postmanwhoalwaysringstwice,give Cameron Crowe credit for trying,5,20 September 2006,"It's always nice to see Hollywood embracing alternate and foreign cinema, but sometimes I really wish that would mean that foreign films would get a wider release and acceptance in the U.S. instead of American audiences receiving yet another sanitized version of a great film from another country. This is exactly how I see ""Vanilla Sky"" (a remake of the 1997 film ""Open Your Eyes"").I must give Cameron Crowe credit for making a valiant effort at shooting such a seemingly unconventional piece, given his resume. In truth, unlike the psychological thriller that the story was previously, Crowe has made something far more romantic.A love for the original piece is clear throughout much of the running time, as it hits each and every beat of that film, and he even uses some of the same camera angles. Oh, Mr. Crowe truly liked ""Open Your Eyes""! Unfortunately it seems that Tom Cruise wasn't willing to fall in love and give himself fully to his character. Both movies deal with a man who is disfigured in an accident. Why is it that in this sanitized version the injuries don't seem all that bad? I could stand to look at Cruise more than the character from the original, whose face was deformed on the border of recognition.To top that off ""Vanilla Sky"" attempts to make sense of a very thought provoking premise.

Neither of the two competing horizontals, Penelope Cruise nor Cameron Diaz made any contribution. At least Ms. Cruz has breasts (we saw them), which Ms. Diaz did not (we did not see them). Ms. Diaz, driving to her death, had the line ""I swallowed your sperm"", which must have come directly from the Spanish script that inspired this still-born movie. I was barely able to keep awake for the whole of this head-banging experience and yearned to switch off: my partner somehow wanted to keep going, but couldn't explain why. I guess it's just wanting to see more of Tom Cruise's uncrushed and mashed facial features, which were restored several times during the incoherent script.

I am a big fan of Cameron Crowe and intrigued by Paul McCartney's title song, I thought this could be good but I was let down. The film stars Tom Cruise as...um, I don't remember the guy's name but it's really not important, Tom Cruise basically plays the same guy he always plays. The chief characteristics of the basic Tom Cruise character is he's 1) God's gift to women 2) Bold and very confident and 3) Has a chip on his shoulder, often something to do with a deceased father figure. Given the right plot, Tom Cruise can usually work well because the character progresses and usually brings the cockiness down to Earth while overcoming that chip on his shoulder, and we often root for him through the whole process because of attribute #1, woman find him good-looking and guys generally think he's pretty cool.        The problem is that there really isn't much of a plot here, so the movie is just on pretty faulty ground with Cruise as the protagonist, and the film eventually falls flat. The movie starts out pretty normal, Cruise wakes up next to Cameron Diaz, a friend who sleeps with him, and goes to work as a business executive, where has to deal with the board that co-owns the company and don't think that Cruise is as qualified as the company's former owner, his father (that's attribute #3). Cruise than goes to a party and falls in love with Penelope Cruz, who's not as easy to get into bed as Cameron Diaz. Yes, Cruise forms a solid friendship with her and is enthusiastic about meeting her cause, as I said he's in love. Then, Cruise is driving around with Cameron Diaz and she bursts with rage over being used by him, and she drives the car over a bridge. Yep, that kind of threw you for a loop, if you were hearing about the storyline for the first time, didn't it?         The real plot kind of gets underway here, but as I said, it's not much of a plot, at least in my opinion. Tom Cruise survives the crash but he's pretty badly injured, that's about the basics. Past that, things are going on in the storyline but not in any real discernable order, and reality just kind of becomes blurred. I won't give away too much, but if you stick with the movie, towards the end, things got a little easier to figure out. However, there's a lot of screentime here, where nothing's really even that easy to understand or that watchable. Also, the film has a sort of dark and depressing tone, and since the darkness didn't really serve any function, i thought that brought down the movie.       One of the bright spots of the movie, however, was Penelope Cruz. She really lit up the screen and it was easy to see why Tom Cruise was falling in love with her.       Past that, the other characters serve little purpose. Cameron Diaz is basically there to hammer in attribute #1 of Cruise's character, because she's very hot herself and her willingness to have sex with him without strings just so she can get closer to him. It makes her a really degrading person, but it makes it easier for Cruise to convince us that his character in this movie is God's gift to women. Jason Lee plays Cruise's best friend and helps develop attribute #2, Cruise's confidence. Because Lee's a complete pushover and clearly is the more subservient one in their friendship, considering how he give up Penelope Cruise for her, how could Cruise not be confident?             In short, this was an admirable experiment for Cameron Crowe, I still like his stuff, I even liked some of his small touches, but a lot of the things in the movie just didn't work at all for me.",Vanilla Sky

104,Med-Jasta,Too much,1,4 September 2020,Every scene is too long and overblown in an attempt to get the point across. A lot of talent involved too. I don't know what happened.

105,smakawhat,A Disapointment,5,14 December 2001,"Being excited once again to catch another Cameron Crowe flic yet again.  The director who brought one of the greatest films of last year into being if not the best (Almost Famous), and the work of Jeremy Macguire, gives us a rework of a Spanish film named Abre Los Ojos (open your eyes).
However the results of this work pale in comparison unfortunatly to Crowe's previous glorious shining moments.  This twighlight zone, dreamscape of a film ends up being not a fascinating memorable piece of work, but a tedious exercise.  While everything seems to be there, good casting, good actors, and an intriguing story, it doesn't flow.  It seems very choppy and more distintresting.  Vanilla sky has the unfortunate habit of leaving the viewer stranded, instead of letting them hitch on a more intriguing ride.
Basicaly Tom Cruise is a rich kid with an easy life, and easy beautiful woman he lusts after on one side, until he falls for Penelope Cruz when she comes to his birthday party.  As the film progresses we meet more characters, we are subjected to flashbacks, intercutting of scenes in the future, some in the past, all with that twighlight zone feel and leaving you disoriented (I can't describe more without giving away too much).  In reality we as the viewer soon begin to realize that we see is not the whole truth as the film toys with the idea of is this real? or is it imagined?  While this has been done greatly in films this year like Mulholand Drive, and the BRILLIANCE of films like Memento, Vanilla Sky leaves the viewer unwilling to even care.  Too many of the scenes go on for far too long, and I lost interest several times.  Many times I wanted this film just to end.  The film does make sense to me and I don't think a second viewing would add to my experience, if anything the first viewing was more of a chore, its one thing to watch a film and be motivated and be awed on screen, than to sit through a disoriented piece with no connection.
Cameron really missed the ball on this one and it's unfortunate.  His touch is there ecspecialy the incorporation of music and scenes (loved the opening scene of empty New York) but in the end this film fails.  So many people in the audience just kept groaning within the last 45 minutes as the scenes and developments kept popping up. I felt their pain.. Rating 5 out of 10.",Vanilla Sky
106,bix171,A Mess,2,18 August 2002,"Cameron Crowe finally confirms what's been suspected for quite some time--that's he's a shallow filmmaker with limited range and visual sensibilities--in perhaps the worst film produced by a major studio this past decade. Crowe reunites with star Tom Cruise to deliver a meandering, incomprehensible fantasy (based on Alejandro Amenabar's 1997 film, `Open Your Eyes', unseen by this reviewer) about the price of beauty and it's easy to see the appeal this theme would have to an actor whose career has been defined by his classic good looks. But Cruise has neither the intellectual prowess nor the acting chops to incite any curiosity (indeed, he spends half the time mumbling through a prosthetic mask or grisly facial makeup) and Crowe seems to want to do little else but indulge his star in wild bits of overacting. As usual, Crowe's staid writing style makes everyone else (including Penelope Cruz, Kurt Russell and Cameron Diaz) look bad too: each performer has some bad dialogue to deliver at one point or another and is forced to do it in an embarrassingly earnest way. Crowe, after incomprehensibly trying--and failing--to position himself as Billy Wilder (you can't be Billy Wilder without mingling romance with cynicism and Crowe doesn't appear to have a cynical bone in his body), seems to be setting himself up as a mixture of Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch, but he's far too pedestrian a filmmaker to capture the essence of either director and the result is a trite, talky, open-ended mess that ends up becoming little more than an ersatz science-fiction mess--albeit with a great soundtrack. You could spend hours trying to decide what it's `about'--and Crowe would love nothing more than to have you do just that--but it would be a waste of time because, other than the vanity thing, it's really about nothing at all. The harsh shock editing is by Joe Hutshing and Mark Livolsi and they destroy the decent, if uninspired, work turned in by cinematographer John Toll. No matter--nothing could overcome Crowe's dull cinematic style anyway.",Vanilla Sky
107,Dockelektro,Idyllic voyage through the stuff that movies are all about,8,24 November 2002,"A definite eye-candy, this movie explores a usually closed and difficult theme: the world of dreams. Carrying the plot on his back is Tom Cruise's engaging character, which plays a successful businessman, which can't resist a beautiful woman or an everlasting dream. His life starts being invaded by choices, errors and emotions, until something changes his life. Divided between an irritating but warm-hearted Cruz and a sexy although slightly mad Diaz, he ends up questioning what is this all about when he's charged with murder. But that's the secret of this movie, so just see it: with a soundtrack that's worth the admission alone, and a great performance by Cruise which shuts up those who think he's only an action hero and a pretty face, the movie also displays Cameron Crowe's skill in involving its viewers. And the movie never stops doing so, from start to finish also thanks to the beautiful cinematography by John Toll. Don't let the strange accent of Penélope fool you, this movie requires more than one viewing. And a movie like that is always worth seeing. If you go to the movies to escape for two hours, this one's for you.",Vanilla Sky
108,barberoux,Narcissistic exercise.,4,3 September 2002,"""Vanilla Sky"" was another Tom Cruise exercise in narcissism.  In the movie he suffers the worse possible fate.  His pretty face is scarred.  I found the first half of this movie to be rather nauseating.   The main characters seem to be a mutual admiration society always telling each other how great they were.  There was a scene in Penélope Cruz's apartment where Tom Cruise looks at pictures on the refrigerator.  The pictures were all of Penélope Cruz.  I did a survey over the weekend of my family's refrigerator pictures and most were of other people or of them with other people.  My own refrigerator is covered with pictures of nieces and nephews.  I found this scene strange that a person puts their own pictures all over the refrigerator.  I wonder if the Hollywood types even caught this.  The second half of the movie was somewhat better in a Sci-fi sort of way.  I had a real hard time caring for the main actors though.  There was no empathy developed because of their self-centered, inward looking lives.  They seem to care for nothing but their own reflection.  If you are in love with the main actors as much as they are in love with themselves then see the movie.  If not miss it.",Vanilla Sky

After that moment the film becomes intricate as David is being accused of murder by Dr McCabe (Kurt Russell) in a sort of parrallel part of the storyline which sees him trying to make sense of it all.

110,Silverzero,Excellent!!!,10,1 November 2002,"There is no way of summarising this film. But to be very brief, Vanilla Sky is filmmaking at its very best. Here is my overall statement in regards to it; I truly loved this film. Vanilla Sky really got 2002 off to a great start. Lets start with the acting.Asides for Oceans Eleven, (another great movie), Vanilla Sky has the best ensemble cast so far this year. First of all, Tom Cruise is the film's shining light. He plays the `Citizen Dildo', rich playboy part and the Elephant Man part supremely. And deserves an Oscar nomination, at least. Penelope Cruz gives a very credible performance and her relationship with Cruise off-screen was a further benefit towards the film. Cameron Diaz is only in the first 40 minutes of the film and any other time she appears in the film, there's something strange going on. Otherwise she's fairly good. Jason Lee, though initially unkempt, is perfect with his `2nd best' character. Kurt Russell gives another top-notch performance, this time as a sympathetic psychiatrist. There are other parts in the film varying from cameos to big rolls. Among these are Noah Taylor, Timothy Spall, Tilda Swilton, Alicia Witt and Steven Spielberg. So, the film has a strong cast and some excellent performances.Followed up by this is some impeccable directing. Cameron Crowe does an excellent job and creates a masterpiece.Vanilla Sky is divided up into 3 parts. For the first 40 minutes it's a witty, romantic slice of life with a thrilling finish. For the next 45 minutes it's a gloomy, dramatic, psychological thriller. The least of the 3 parts. And, the 3rd part. For the final 45 minutes, Vanilla Sky is a mystery thriller cum sci-fi drama.PLOT SPOILERS I liked the twist in the end. I'm well aware that its caused controversy, but I think that a sci-fi twist was the way to go. Without the cryogenation-half-way-through-the-movie, the film would not have worked. It explains everything, so that there's no questions asked. It also leaves you asking questions about philosophy and reality, afterwards. SPOILERS ENDIt covers SO many genres. It's a drama, thriller, romance, mystery, noir, comedy and a sci-fi. In conclusion, if you have a short attention span and/or are a sarcastic, moronic cynic, then don't watch Vanilla Sky. Otherwise, rent it NOW. 10/10.",Vanilla Sky
111,The_Wood,Haunting and Unforgettable 10/10,10,22 May 2002,"Like looking at a beautiful painting and not being able to turn away, Vanilla Sky is a film filled with great beauty and mystery.  Filled with wonderfully poetic lines, ""I'll see you in another life, when we are both cats.""  Beautiful shots that are heartbreaking -- the vanilla sky at the end of the film.  A soundtrack that will bring you to tears (the final song by Sigur Ros is especially chilling).  Tom Cruise and Cameron Crowe deliver one of 2001's best films.  A four star unappreciated masterpiece that deserves to be a classic.  This is some wonderful cinema.",Vanilla Sky
112,refresh_daemon,"Not quite compelling, but some interesting interpretations of a superior work",5,14 March 2008,"This remake of Open Your Eyes is mostly a point-by-point remake of the original film, but a number of changes in characterization and story drive the film to ultimately have a different (and rather confused) message and consequently, not as potent a work in terms of overall storytelling as its Spanish predecessor. It still has some merit in being a little bit of a mind-trip and slight meditations on the variety of themes that it chooses to embrace.The story is again about a handsome young man that has it all. However, it comes crashing down on him when he makes a costly decision and then things start getting weird. Part of the issue that I have with this film is that it really fails to strongly set up (and maintain) a motivation for the protagonist to make the later decisions that he does. While it does have a really good (and different) set-up with the protagonist and his relationship to his successful late father, this gets lost as the film progresses and somewhere in the middle of the film, the protagonist suddenly picks up a rather difficult to believe motivation in ""love"", which is difficult to believe because elements of his original motivation still drive a lot of his decision-making.In the end, this lack of focus on a central theme (or premise) for the film causes it to lose overall thematic coherence, lessening its impact. Director Cameron Crowe does manage to create his own unique take on the look of the film and at times it's quite impressive and unique to his own style. Another thing to note about the film is that it has a wonderful soundtrack. The film is full of great pop-rock-alt music. Unfortunately, the music hardly lets up for very long and gives the drama little room to breath. Furthermore, the mix throws the music up too much in the front and sometimes makes it hard to focus on the film. Never have I so hated the fact that such a great soundtrack was present in the film.On the positive side, the players all inject their characters with interesting performances that differ from the original's characters. The work overall isn't that convincing, especially in creating a dreamlike mood for the various dreams, but that might also be my personal taste for subtlety combined with my general foreknowledge of how the plot's going to play out affecting my perception.In the end, Vanilla Sky does manage to conjure up some interesting images and meditations, but falls short of being compelling. It's biggest weakness is the lack of believable character motivations and a coherent theme and premise to the story. That and the overdone soundtrack. I found Vanilla Sky to be just short of a passable watch in the end and while it might be a decent mind-trip of a film, if you want to choose between this one and the Spanish original, I highly suggest the original, a far more compelling, even if problematic, work. 5/10.",Vanilla Sky

Until half an hour passed, you understand almost everything that is happening, but then you get lost on purpose, the director wants you to get lost, just like Tom gets lost in his life. He drives you left and right, up and down, your starting to lose your patience with the movie and then, pop, your back in the driving seat again, why ?, because wow, you just understood something, you connected a few puzzling scenes and your feeling confident about the movie again. You feel for Tom, you are feeling sad like all of that is happening to you, not in some movie that already lost you a few times, but managed to get you back in the last moment. The ending explains it all, makes everything so perfectly clear, but many things leave you feeling pointless about the movie now, and that is why I don't like the ending.

Likewise, I enjoy a good thinking film open to interpretation. So reading these reviews I should of enjoyed this film. Wrong.
It was awful. I had no problem following it or understanding the plot ""getting it"" as many have said. It was just painfully dull & went against everything that good cinema is about. Dreams are difficult to effectively insert into films at the best of times but it was done terribly here.
Interpretations are all well & good, but I'd imagine no 2 people who even worked on this film would share a view exactly what went on. It asked some interesting questions & created some Matrix style ideas. Unfortunately, none of them were fully executed & you end up with more questions than answers.Maybe it was just the whole subject. This wasn't the film I set out to see nor had any idea it was a remake, but I get the feeling I won't enjoy the original, nor, heaven forbid, any future similar films.I gave it an hour & a half of solid concentration but then lost the will to live.

The action and the story is well told, and probably it is a little less dark (to adapt it to US market). On the other hand, neither Crowe nor Cruise are in their best moment, as Amenabar is much better than Crowe, and surprisingly, Noriega plays a better part than Tom.

123,Aidan McGuinness,Different is not necessarily brilliant,7,30 January 2002,"""Vanilla Sky"" is a hard movie to judge because it's not quite in the normal Hollywood mode, which is generally a good thing though it doesn't mean you end up with a good movie.It's hard to talk too much about the plot of the movie without actually spoiling the movie. It's sufficient to say that Cruise's character David is disfigured in a car accident somehow and has been arrested for murder. The details prior to his arrest are revealed in that, somewhat tired old narrative tool of flash-back. What makes the film more interesting is that it switches between a couple of time-lines and the time-lines themselves can shift in keeping with David's memory of events. However in the final third of the movie the plot takes a gigantic shift and asks the viewer to swallow some rather large doses of disbelief. The final ending whiffed a bit too much of ""AI"" for me in terms of tone and sentiment and was somewhat unsatisfactory. The plot may shift a bit but, despite what other reviewers would have you believe, isn't all that complicated. Certainly at the end it's hammered home as to what happened to David that only an idiot *could* be confused... and it also speaks too much of a ""big reset"" button. You'll know what I mean once you've seen it all.Cruise is good in this. Generally I'm indifferent to his acting, feeling he gets by on his pretty-boy looks but he finds justification for himself playing the tortured soul here. Penelope Cruz is adequate although doesn't exhibit a whole load of emotional range (presumably stymied by not acting in her native tongue) and Diaz has a tendence to put in a somewhat hammy-psycho-girl performance which I can not always take seriously. David's mate, played by Jason Lee, and David's lawyer, played by Kurt Russell, are both perfectly passable without being scene-stealing or giving the Academy anything to notice.As to Crowe's adaptation of the original movie, I found it for the most part well enough done. Firstly I enjoyed the sound-track, partially because it featured about 5 of my favourite bands but also because the musically was generally particularly well chosen (as someone pointed out the REM track ""Sweetness Follows"" is excellently placed). The cuts between scenes are generally well handled without being confusing or unnecessary and the production values, in the character's houses, reflect the personas well. Crowe can be a bit heavy-handed at times and this is of particular note in his overly-long explanation of ""what happened"" at the end of the movie. Perhaps this is for the benefit of the slower audience members but it made the ending drag out too much (again like ""AI"") - certainly I knew there would be a ""surprise"" ending and correctly guessed the main device that would be used (since Crowe made it quite obvious earlier on in the movie that it would be used - again too heavy). It's well done and capable - scenes like the much-touted Times Square are nice and add to the movie but it's nothing comparable to the sharper touches of David Fincher's ""Fight Club"" to which the movie has (somewhat erroneously) been compared.I'd recommend you see ""Vanilla Sky"" to form your own opinion. It's a breath of fresh air at least and is that bit ""different"" from your average formulaic 5 act movie. Whether you'll come across feeling somewhat mutely disappointed, as I did, is hard to tell. In the end I'll give it a 7/10 and look with interest to see if Crowe can do better next time seeing as how I enjoyed his last piece ""Almost Famous"" that bit more than this.",Vanilla Sky
124,Brogan,The talented Mr. Crowe.,10,12 December 2001,"Man oh man.  Leave it to Cameron Crowe.  Last year he directed the most whimsical film which was also one of the best movies ever made, (ALMOST FAMOUS).  Now he's directed one of the most thought provoking films ever made, which could also just as well be one of the best films this year, VANILLA SKY.  This is a film that will have you think about what you just saw and the more you take the film apart, the more meaning there is behind the film.  This isn't the same style of Cameron Crowe who directed the crowd pleasing, JERRY MAGUIRE.  This is more like the nightmare of Jerry Maguire. David Aames (Tom Cruise) ownes 51% of a major magazine publishing company, that he inherited from his father.  The other 49% of the company is owned and runed by the seven board members of the company, which David likes to call ""the Seven Dwarfs.""  He is despised by the members as being another ""rich kid who got daddy's business"" which has David feel that he is the victim of a conspiracy.  But outside of work, David is flirtatious, he is having an affair with a stunning blonde named Julie (Cameron Diaz).  David feels only lust for Julie, no love.  It isn't until David's best friend, Brian Shelby (Jason Lee) introduces David to Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz), that David begins to feel different.  David is attracted to Sofia, but he feels different, he is in love with Sofia, not lust.  And this leads David to realize that Sofia is changing his life, and for the first time in his life, from the flirting with Julie and the pressures at work, David feels great.  Julie sees David is attracted to Sofia and is jealous, she feels that David violated her by treating her like a sex object.  While David is at his peak, Julie is at her downfall, which leads to Julie crashing her car off a bridge with her and David in it.      When David wakes up from his coma after several months, he is living his nightmare.  He is being charged for murder, he is incarcerated, he's seeking psychatric help from Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell), and the worst thing is that David's face has been disfigured making him from looking handsome to horrifying.  David's worst nightmares are coming true, which causes David to mentally and physically try to bring his life back to the way it was. VANILLA SKY is a remake of the 1997 film OPEN YOUR EYES.  I haven't seen the original version, but for Crowe's version, it's a very stylish and well made thriller.  Crowe uses his skills to make VANILLA SKY similar to his previous films, with the entertaining dialogue, and excellent romantic chemistry.  You would think that at first VANILLA SKY is another retelling of Crowe's previous work JERRY MAGUIRE.  But then it turns into the darkest of nightmares.  Being disfigured, accussed or murder, the fear of not being in love anymore, being alone, and worst of all, being depressed is the darkest of feelings that any human being could feel.  Crowe makes an impressive turn at turning VANILLA SKY from a cute touch romance, to a intense and depressing thriller. The acting is brought out the strongest by it's star Tom Cruise. Unlike the flamboyance of MAGNOLIA, the anger of BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, and the confused JERRY MAGUIRE, David Aames is in a lot of pain.  Cruise does a outsanding job as the man who is suffering from the car accident and realizes that things can't be the way they were.  I also enjoyed the performance by Kurt Russell, who gives a strong acting performance as the doctor who is looking deep inside Cruise's character to see if he can find the answer causing David's pain.  And the support from Penelope Cruz, Jason Lee, and Cameron Diaz are all also good.  The romantic chemistry between Tom and Penelope is fantastic, you can see how they fell in love with each other in reality.  But it's the Oscar worthy performance by Cruise that helps carry the picture. I was also strongly pleased with the music soundtrack that Crowe and wife Nancy Wilson put together for the film.  I was amazed to hear the little known gem by the Monkees ""Porpoise Song (Theme From Head)"" being played in the movie.  Like HEAD, VANILLA SKY is similar in style by taking the viewer into a trip that is unforgettable.  And other songs by Paul McCartney (doing the title tune), Peter Gabriel, Stereolab, Chemical Brothers, Bob Dylan, and Spiritualized, is a fantastic soundtrack of mixing classic songs from the 60's with the similar style songs of the 21st century. Then finally there is Cameron Crowe's directing.  He has the viewer keep guessing on what is going on while watching the film until the very end.  It isn't until it's over that you do understand what is going on, and are still amazed by the twist.  And Crowe never does make the film boring, it might be weird or confusing, but never silly or boring.  Crowe also manages to take the film from one mood into another mood without any faults. VANILLA SKY is a film that won't please the Tom Cruise fans who would like to see him do more films like TOP GUN and DAYS OF THUNDER.  Nope, sorry folks, that Tom Cruise has hopefully passed on, this is the Tom Cruise like EYES WIDE SHUT and MAGNOLLIA, the one who does a level texture role and not just the hero.  VANILLA SKY also proves that Cameron Crowe doesn't have to do only romantic comedies to show that he's a brilliant filmmaker, he can do thrillers with a stroke of genius.  For those who like film with intelligence and wit, then don't miss VANILLA SKY, one of, if not the best film of the year!  ***** (out of five)",Vanilla Sky

Tom Cruise makes his usual bad choice of projects and flails around the screen like a high school Hamlet on speed.  Cameron Crowe is the perfect director for Cruise - they come from the same Hack school of little-kid acting and sentimental-empty directing.  I can't believe that Cameron Diaz impressed some people with this performance.  She never could act and used to be amusingly cute, but that's over for her.  She'll gladly muck up the screen in big-budget trash like Cruise has, although he was good in Magnolia and Rain Man.Who enjoys this kind of tripe?  No wonder American films are taking another nose-dive like the entire decade of the 80's.  Is there any hope?",Vanilla Sky
127,aramo1,"Beautiful, twisted movie.",8,12 August 2002,"Based on R1 DVD 136 min.I've only watched 'Vanilla Sky' once and; like Memento; it is a movie that demands repeated viewing. For what it's worth I made the mistake of watching this movie without reading any of the better reviewers [e.g. Ebert] so I dismissed several of the early warning cues as directorial slips - my mistake.This movie is visually beautiful, the characters are solid, there is a unquestionable chemistry between Cruise and the leading ladies. Diaz gives a powerful performance as both the playmate and later.Sci-Fi, conspiracy and psychological thriller fans should all find much to like in this movie, the strong cast and sheer beauty will give it a far wider appeal.If you are about to watch 'Vanilla Sky' for the first time here's a tip - listen very carefully to the first few minutes.8/10 minor masterpiece",Vanilla Sky
128,lotus_chief,One..........Big..........MESS!!!!,3,11 December 2003,"I first went to the theater to see this with my girlfriend....needless to say I fell asleep half way through...she somehow stayed awake through the whole thing and we both immediately wrote it off as a horrible film.  It just showed on HBO and I finally decided to sit through it and actually watch it this time, and my opinion hasn't changed.  As another reviewer put it, Vanilla Sky tries TOO HARD to be clever.  I got the gist of the film from the first 20 minutes and the last 15 minutes.  That's all I needed. Everything else in between is useless.  I read all the people talkin about this movie, saying that whoever doesnt like this movie don't like to think and 'don't know anything about movies', and so on and so forth. Okay..... its one thing to try and bring a story with deep meaning and insight into film....but its another thing to cram a bunch of philosophical, sci-fi babble into a film and pass if off as 'clever' and 'imaginative'.  That's exactly what Crowe does with Vanilla Sky.  Amazingly, in trying to do all of that it STILL finds a way to come off as boring.  Now I get the whole thing about getting a second chance at life, and finding happiness and true love and such...but CMON!Experiencing Vanilla Sky is like me asking someone to do a puzzle while I slowly drop its pieces onto the canvas as the person tries putting it together....only to then bring the person the puzzle almost put together with a few pieces still missing.  It's all a big MESS!  I see what they were trying to do with the story, but they couldn't present it better than this???  A bunch of ill conceived, drawn out, disjointed sequences that has no irrelevance, to the point where the story itself is lost??  Vanilla Sky represents a cop out in filmmaking, its that simple.  ""Lets just confuse the HELL out of them for 2 hours and in the last 20 minutes just explain everything that just happened"".  What's the point?  It's all a waste of time.  The only thing that matters by the end of the movie is, as I said, everything up until the car crash and the last 15 minutes on the roof. The story was executed SO POORLY, that anything other than those two parts is just an excuse to drag the story along.  This movie was TERRIBLY executed. It could've been so much better if it was organized and constructed better.*1/2 out of **** stars",Vanilla Sky

Where the original shines with a constant moving back and forth toward an uncertain ending, that leads to several possible final answer (is it a dream? is it virtual reality?

I won't tell anything more than this film truly takes an unexpected direction and becomes something entirely. The first act of the film is your standard rom-com, then the second act takes a very dramatic direction and the final act is something really bizzare.

I don't know what the hell else he could have been trying to do. It sure wasn't to make a believable, or even coherent film. The overly familiar Kurt Russell as an enigmatic psychiatrist?... pffft.

133,llihilloh,This is the second worst film I have ever seen.,1,30 November 2002,"'Vanilla Sky' is awful.  It is the second worst film that I have ever had the misfortune of viewing.  'Mulholland Dr.' is the absolute worst, but I don't know, it comes pretty close.It is so weird how I dislike this film, yet I love Cameron Crowe's previous film, 'Almost Famous' so much.  'Almost Famous' is one of my favorite films of all time.  So, what was Crowe's problem here?  I have no idea, but his direction of this project is so bad that it's a wonder if he finds work after this.  Tom Cruise, what were you thinking?  Oh, I just adore Cruise, but it really hurts that he would go out and pick this dud when he could have had the pick of ANY film in the world.  I think that he is a terrific actor, and his looks don't hurt, of course, but his acting was so....dull in 'Vanilla Sky.' For some unknown reason, he managed to get well over $20 million here, but for what exactly?  Cameron Diaz was just okay.  I don't understand how she got the kind of (rave) reviews she got.  How did she get a Golden Globe nomination?  Everyone acts as if she was the main character in this film, when really she didn't even have that big of a part.  Seriously, her performance was overrated, overrated, overrated!  Penélope Cruz.  What can I say except that she is the worst actress ever.  Well, I suppose if you're out to capture a terrible movie, you better go out and hire the worst actress in the industry.  Not only is she hard to understand her with the darn accent and all, but....she can't act!  It's as plain and simple as that.  She acts as if she's the best thing in the picture.  I hate to use this saying because even I hate it, but she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.  Oh, I like Jason Lee.  It's a shame that he had such a small part.  Kurt Russell must have been in dire need of work when he signed on to do this film.  This cast is one of the most terrible ones that I have ever seen.  Again, why'd you do it Tom!?This plot is so out there.  It is way too out there.  The film was all fine and everything up until the car accident.  After that, it was complete chaos and confusion.  'Vanilla Sky' continued on and it seemed okay, I suppose, but then when the whole thing is explained and 'cleared up', it just gets messed up again (if that makes any sense).  The writing was BORING!  I couldn't even follow half of the script mainly because I didn't want to.  The whole film just seemed so pointless. 
There were two things in this film that I actually did like.  One, Jason Lee manages to show up.  I loved him in 'Almost Famous' and it was a pleasure to see him again, no matter how minor his role was.  Two, I really liked the famous Times Square scene.  It was different and very cool.  Come on, what other film could have pulled that stunt off?There's nothing worse than a movie that ends too quickly, leaving a lot to the imagination.  And that's exactly what 'Vanilla Sky' did.  It ended at the drop of a hat and I was actually left staring at the TV screen wondering if something else would pop back up.  You know, to clarify some things. Yeah, it didn't.So, the script was meant to...well, I don't really know what it was meant to do.  Maybe its goal was to help people get a good night's rest.  I don't know!  Tom Cruise is a good actor but fails to deliver an even half decent performance.  Two other good things slip onto the screen, but Penélope Cruz and that retarded mask that Cruise wears for most of the film, manage to completely ruin the film all together.  'Vanilla Sky' gets a big old '1' out of me.  I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone.",Vanilla Sky
134,saarvardi,"""Tech Supppppoooorrrrttt!""",10,20 January 2007,"Halfway through watching Vanilla Sky, I was willing to let go of the whole damn thing and give up on watching it. The plot jumped from drama to romance to suspense and so on, not giving you too many threads or clues as to what's really going on. Thing is, if you lack the proper patience, you lack the tools to fully realize the masterpiece that director Cameron Crowe has created for us here. Vanilla Sky chronicles the strange events that occur to one David Aames (portrayed accurately by the ever so talented Tom Cruise), a 33 year-old New York playboy, who's lavish lifestyle and reckless behavior is about to take a sudden and extremely violent twist. Aames is the sole inheritor of a publishing company and a real lady's man. After encountering the beautiful Sofia at a party (Penelope Cruz, who also became Cruise's real-life partner for a while at the time this movie hit theaters), David seemingly has a reason to finally settle down and let go of his hectic manners. Unfortunately, that's exactly when reality comes around in the shape of Julie, a hurt and neglected ex-lover who's determined to settle the score with him once and for all  thus denying him the chance of love and happiness he took away from her so abruptly. The jaded lover (Cameron Diaz, in an eccentric and unconventional role) takes David on a highway to hell, driving them both into a tragic car accident. When David wakes up, his face is deformed, his ownership of the company is at risk, and he's haunted by whatever has happened to Julie. Our hero has to grow up and adjust to the harsh reality quickly, or else he'll lose what little he has left. However, adapting to the new status isn't as easy as it may seem. Something has changed in his post-accident life, and he can't quite put his finger on it. Whatever it is, it all comes down to the choices he made after the accident, those turns of fate that now come back to haunt him, thrusting his life into a nightmarish reality  if, indeed, you can call his existence a realityThroughout the film, Tom Cruise plays the tormented David with such accuracy, you really believe he's going through all these highly surreal events. In the end, without spoiling the film entirely, it's all about the way we handle the choices we make in life, and our never ending pursuit after the things we want the most. It's that bittersweet feeling you can always open your eyes and take the other path in life, that also made me return to this film and watch it over and over again throughout the course of the 5.5 years that went by since I first watched it in theaters. In time, I found many comparisons between the film and the general feel of this decade  which Vanilla Sky captures best. When Cruise's David loses his looks and becomes old real fast, it's the filmmaker foreshadowing our need, as a society, to wake up and face our problems instead of running away from them. The mixture of genres also blends well into this theory, as none of us really know how to approach the historical shifts all around us. When David runs through the empty streets and passes the abandoned Times Square, I saw our whole generation seeking for something familiar amidst the cold and aggressive present. Bottom line - after watching hundreds and hundreds of Hollywood products from the 2000's, Vanilla Sky remains one of the most compelling and brilliant films I am yet to have seen this decade. It's an intense and intriguing story from A to Z, which really only makes you understand it completely towards the final quarter of the film, when it shifts into yet another genre - Science Fiction. P.S.: Watch out for one of the most bizarre uses of a Beach Boys song toward the end of the movie, when all things truly go berserk.",Vanilla Sky

137,RIK-22,Weak Twilight Zone episode spread over 2 hours,3,17 September 2002,"I'd heard mainly negative criticism about this film and my expectations were low, so perhaps I could be pleasantly surprised, unfortunately not.First of all, the story is very weak.  I generally like these type of films, `Welcome to Blood City', being a great example.  Question who we are, our place in the universe and our perceptions of the world are all interesting themes.  The problem is the story is quite simplistic and is presented in an annoying disjointed manner.  I know this was done deliberately, but spread over 2 hour +, this can get very annoying.  The filmmakers really needed to make the collapse of the VR much more gradual and subtle leading up to a crescendo, but atlas it was a mixed mess.On story and presentation, maybe the film would have got a 5 or 6/10 from me.  After watching probably one of the worst actors in Hollywood (Mr Cruise, in case I needed to clarify) present one of the most obnoxious uninteresting characters I have ever seen, what's with this stupid boyish grin the whole time.  Add Penelope Cruz, who was almost as bad, then you have no believability and no chemistry whatsoever.  Jason Lee, was also very unconvincing as 'the friend' which Cruise treated like crap.  Actually Jason Lee repeated his performance in `Almost Famous', yet another poor effort from Mr Crowe.Thirdly the length of the film, shorten it for God's sake, a plot this weak, doesn't need 2+ hours to send people to sleep, it could do it in 80 minutes.It's a shame about Mr Crowe, Jerry Maguire was excellent, IMO, but I recently saw Almost Famous and Singles, both were very poor, the only redeeming feature was that Singles had the best band in the world playing on the soundtrack (Pearl Jam, which I'm sure you already knew).3/10.",Vanilla Sky

Well, it happened to be a little bit of both, and it sucked.It started out good.  I love Radiohead.  I wish there was more of that. But by the end we are listening to Good Vibrations by The Beach Boys.  Talk about a wide range of suck between.  They had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a couple others, but why oh why did they have to blare GV during the climax.  It was more annoying than confusing or blatant. Especially when it has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PLOT.  At least put some meaning behind the songs.  Kid A = primary.  Whatever.He also did a bang up job with the club scene.  That was cool.  Otherwise the movie was one big ball of arrogance.  As if audiences would get the movie.  The ones that would get it read subtitles, and the rest won't. Its as simple as that.  The motivations got all screwed up.  I didn't comprehend the Diaz motivations (hadn't they done the Chicken Soup night before?) and some of the others.  And I hate Kurt Russell.  Stay overboard.  Tom Cruise can't act (especially in these types of movie [i.e. Eyes Wide Shut]).  And the elevator.  I get it.

140,zenmateisshite,Can movie critics be anymore pretentious?,5,19 February 2020,"Since both Spanish and English version are almost scene-by-scene copies I will be reviewing them as the same movie.
The movie starts as a drama. Third of the way in you find yourself wondering: is this really deep, or is it really shallow. Moving forward, it turns into a sci-fi, kinda.
Then the story becomes needlessly complicated. Its not easy to follow but its no Memento, nor is it The Fifth Element so you end up watching till the end and after a few twists and turns the story unfolds.My opinion is that the first dramatic half is truly shallow and very meh. The second sci-fi half, well they do not explain it that much, but it is also blah. Is this an original movie? Well, the idea of living in a simulation have been discussed before, if that is what the movie was about. Was it? Or was it about falling in ""love"" with someone you really have no clue about? Or is it telling us that if you're a shallow person your mind will play tricks on you if by chance you happen to become frozen in perpetual dreamland - so you need to improve your personality? Who knows.I personally prefer the Spanish storyline, it makes more sense. The English version has better acting and production values, because it was done later. Both had horrible dialogue, with very awkward Spanish humor translated into English somehow.The biggest problem for me is how critics on rotten tomatoes are scoring the Spanish version at 85% but the English one less than half that at 42%, even though it is virtually the same film. Sure the Spanish one was first but as mentioned, it is not really original by its own right. The difference of the scenes, storyline, acting, and language does not justify this big variance. It just goes to show how these critics are a bunch know-it-all parasites. At least here on IMDB the public scores both versions more closely.",Vanilla Sky
141,adrongardner,Better off getting teeth pulled,1,9 June 2002,"Tom Cruise is at his best here (which sadly means he is horrible) in this painfully watchable film.  Could this be the worst acted movie of the year? Yes.  Could it be Cameron Crowe still doesn't know how to direct a movie? Yes.  Could you find a more silly movie out there this year? No. What we have here is a sorry remake of a better film.  It goes from being The Game, to Phantom of the Opera, to Total Recall and despite that ambitious combination, it can't pull it off.  The structure is quite laughable, the film could have ended any way and there would be nothing to contradict the finale.  Before he jumps at the end, I wondered when the Klingons would begin landing.  Any film that requires fifteen minutes (FIFTEEN!) to explain itself at the end is a waste of my time.  Fight Club did it in a minute, The Others did it in a minute, The Usual Suspects did it in a minute, The Sixth Sense did it in a minute.  Hell in Empire Strikes Back they didn't waste fifteen minutes on why Darth Vader is Luke's pop.  Why then does VANILLA SKY need fifteen minutes to lay out the logic of the story?  Now theres the really mystery.  They would have been better off with an ambiguous ending, explaining the whole thing merely cheapens   most of the film to ""HA!

142,elcopy,Confusing Vanilla Ice,3,17 December 2001,"Abre Los Ojos, the original film this movie is based on, was madea couple of years before The Matrix (yet, premiered in the States in1999 as well), it was a well balanced murder-thriller with a bit ofthe existential matters, and what-is-real questions the Matrixunintentionally address. No wonder it found fans here in the U.S.,like Tom Cruise, but unfortunately, what happens in everyEuropean film that is translated into an American movie (with theexception of The Birdcage, and maybe Scent of a Woman) the U.S.version always falls short. Mainly because they're usuallydumbed-down for American consumption (Point of No Return, TheVanishing to name a couple).But not Vanilla Sky, which is actually done by a good director. Theproblem with Vanilla Sky is that the director makes a mess out ofthe original script, indulging too much on parts of it not meaningfulto the story, a cool soundtrack and maybe assuming people sawthe first so he could play with this one. The result is a confusingfilm that doesn't know where it wants to go.(Spoiler alert) A key element of the plot is the concept of cryogenics, which is notsomething so complicated to explain as seen in Abre Los Ojos,and this year's A.I., Artificial Intelligence. It's not new, and it's evenpracticed in real life. Somehow Vanilla Sky makes a lousy jobexplaining it, calling it ""Life Extension"" and a lot of chit chat about adefrosted dog that has little to do with the idea (storing your body ina freezer for a future when a cure for your disease is found). Irepeat: this is a key element of the plot. You make this confusing;the whole movie gets more difficult to understand. This was notonly the only thing messed up to make the plot more confusing.The original kept the audience on the edge, making it wonder tothe very end if the weird stuff going on is a nightmare, or the maincharacter has really gone wacko. Vanilla Sky goes for the""nightmare"" theory, which leaves some parts unexplained (like whythe main character prefers to be interrogated with his mask on),again, making it confusing.I'm still surprised though the remake didn't work. The casting wasexcellent, New York City as the setting is perfect, the soundtrack,as in any Crowe film, kicks butt, and the story is faithful to theoriginal in many ways.

I liked the way thefilm's trailers made you think the movie was going to work outquite differently than it does. The only problem is that the filmworks out in the most preposterous way imaginable.Tom Cruise is allowed to over-act in scene after scene (or maybeit's just that he's not a very good actor). Penelope Cruz tries to becute, but ends up a disappointment (unless, of course, you have acrush on the actress). However, Cameron Diaz comes up withanother nice performance, and at least you have to give her creditfor booking onto unusual projects. SPOILER ALERT!!!There's no question that director Cameron Crowe worked out hisimagery with great care, and that most of our clues to the mysteryof the ad exec's life hinges on those clues. But the film starts offwith one set of rules (Cruise versus the board of his company) andends up with another which is quite unexpected (Cruise havinglucid dreams during suspended animation). While the twist mighthave worked under different conditions, the audience has no realreason to believe that the medical technology is nothing but a cruelhoax. As a result, the twist ending is almost a deus ex machinafinale. It makes sense in a contrived kind of way, but you feel as ifyou've been cheated. Vanilla Sky is a drama founded on cinematic tricks.

146,K-Slicer,The best film of 2001,10,27 December 2001,"This is a movie that will make you feel brain-fried after one viewing of it. I think this is the best film that Tom Cruise and Cameron Crowe have both made.  The movie contains excellent dialogue, ravishing cinematography, subtle comedy, and a great deal of intellectual ideas on dreams.  ""Vanilla Sky"" reminds a little of the lesser known ""The Thirteenth Floor"" in the idea of distinguishing what is real and was it unreal.  Cameron Crowe took a chance on directing a movie that crosses several different genres and it has paid off.  Tom Cruise is excellent as the facially-deformed David Aames. Kurt Russell did well as Dave's psychoanalyst.  Jason Lee made a surprising performance as Dave's best friend.  The best performance in the entire movie IMHO is Penelope Cruz as Sofia (she did well in certain serious and certain funny moments).  Cameron Diaz was great as the sweet-covered but sour-centered Julie.  Overall, this is one of the best multi-genre movies ever made and one of my all-time favorites.10 out of 10.  This is best film of 2001.",Vanilla Sky
147,kylehodgdon,This Is My Favorite Movie Of All Time,10,18 November 2009,"Everything from the opening scene of a desolate Times Square to the final scene of David falling from the building, everything about ""Vanilla Sky"" is beautiful and mesmerizing. The script could not have been better. With a mix of mystery, thriller, drama, and even a little humor, this film has the perfect balance of all of my favorite movie types all wrapped into one. I recently read online that one ending for this could have been that the entire movie was a dream or that it was all a fictional story written by Brian. I am really glad that they decided to not go that route and instead to have half the movie real and half of it a dream.Every scene in the movie had a purpose and it was all beautifully done. I already mentioned the first and final scenes, but there is also the car ride and crash, the scenes with the doctor where we try to figure out what happened, the party, the time he spent with Sofia, the night at the bar, and many more.I love Tom Cruise and thought that he was perfect for this role. The subtle things like his facial expressions or sarcastic reactions make him one of the best in the world at what he does. The supporting cast is also great in their roles. The music in this film also adds to the beauty and emotion. From David going crazy and singing ""What if God was One of Us"", to ""Can we Still be Friends"" when he is smothering Sofia with the pillow and especially with Sigur Rós playing in the final fall; all of the music that was chosen was right on point. I can't say enough about this film, but it is an absolute masterpiece. I will be surprised if I ever view a movie I enjoy more than ""Vanilla Sky"".",Vanilla Sky
148,howie73,Better than the original,6,10 April 2005,"This faithful adaptation of the overrated Spanish original, Open Your Eyes( 1997)is superior to its predecessor in many ways. Firstly, director Cameron Crowe avoids the original's mistake of making the lead character deeply unlikeable and unsympathetic. Gone is the sullen Cesar from the original! Conversely, Cruise's playboy tycoon David is much more sympathetic character, whose flaws are not grounded solely on a nihilistic desire to end his nightmarish paranoia, but rather to find meaning in the lucid dream he has entered. Crowe presents David as a human figure, holding on to his only chance of first love. The original, in contrast, was lost in its own nihilistic cul de sac. Little was shown of Cesar's inner life. Crowe has a field day examining the nature of memory through media-saturated images that stay in our mind - album covers, songs, film clips. They all make up the texture of the human mind and memory - and it's this aspect (which was missing from the original) that invests Vanilla Sky with a surprising intellectual dimension. Is our memory constructed so much by the media that we cannot differentiate levels of reality? The notion of the lucid dream is represented more vividly in Vanilla Sky than the obscure, quasi-Descartian fluff about artificial perception in the original. Crowe ties lucid dream to corporate re-branding of reality and in this sense is saying much more than the flat rendering of this hyper-reality dreamed up in the cold, austere original.Sometimes remakes are better than the original.",Vanilla Sky
149,lingmeister,Philosophical and thought provoking,8,21 December 2002,"Watching Vanilla Sky made you think it is mostly about nothing until you see the David Aames, played by Tom Cruise, in a mask talking to the prison psychiatrist, played by Kurt Russell.  Then you wonder what has he done that brings him to this situation.  It does lead you through a convoluted story that sometimes didn't make sense, or where character and their relationships did a flip, until it is revealed at the end.  It makes you to think about one's whole existence and the perception of reality, and which state are we in now.Some of the parts were a little forced upon us, mostly the ending, which is like a Scoby-Doo explain it all type of scenario.  The appearance of the tech support for a few scenes and his explanation of David's ability to change his outcome did not make too much sense since he seem to be telling David outright that his is not living in reality.  And I am not sure how in the world he forget such a shocking experience and did not try to apply it to the tragic experience he was encountering?  Others include the beginning scenes where his company is surviving and thriving for any period of time when it is under the control and management of `I don't care about anything beside having fun' David is a little incredible.  Also, the belief that one is reliving an album cover makes no sense unless one sees it from the camera perspective, which I presume, would arouse suspicion.This movie seems to be Tom Cruise's venue to show his acting ability, where he is pretty much driving the whole movie.  Kurt Russell and his interaction was not convincing enough for me to believe that David was looking at the Doctor as a father figure and the Doctor was providing that back.  And forget Penélope Cruz, her acting ability seems to consist of reciting lines.Cameron Crowe seem to not be able to get himself out of the 60/70's time period.  With these old cars, old music, old album cover, etc.  It is great when the plot revolves around it or when it is set in that time period, but when you see everything revolve around it, it kind of detract from the feel of the movie.A interesting film on lucid dreams is Waking Life, where the subject parallels this film, but with a little more of am I asleep or am I awake question.Overall, a good film, with some quirks, but with lots of thoughts to ponder upon.",Vanilla Sky
150,rmarkd,This movie floored me,7,16 December 2001,"We open with an aerial view of NYC with intermittent pauses of darkness and silence. David Aames (Cruise) wakes up and drives off to see a deserted NYC at 9AM. It's eerily quiet. But it's also just a dream and he wakes up again, and this time all is normal. But at that point, I realized that this movie is going to be a mindfu--. Boy, does it deliver.The movie can almost be cut into three pieces: the somewhat hokey beginning, the mindfu--ing middle portion, and the resolution that will make many go back to see it again. The hokey beginning shows Cruise living the life of a rich punk getting everything he wants, including Sofia Serrano (Cruz). They have an incredible non-sexual night together; one of those nights where two people connect. He falls for Serrano, which frustrates Gianni to no end, causing her to drive him off a bridge, disfiguring his face.The second part is filled with disjointed scenes where Cruise is in a jail cell talking with Dr. McCabe (Russell) about a murder while reliving the past. Things become less and less clear and soon the audience is completely confused as to what the hell is going on. But don't worry as when the secret is revealed, it explains much (though perhaps not all), and even does a nice job stringing in past scenes. I don't want to give anything away; you'll know what I mean when you see it.The movie isn't perfect, IMO. I wasn't crazy about Cruz, as some of the lines delivered seemed flat, and one scene where she runs away is almost comedic. Also, Crowe sometimes drowns the movie in music to the point of distraction. The first part does sort of lag, but only because it is supposed to establish the story so I don't fault that.Bottom line, this movie may require some patience in the beginning, but it totally captures you about 1/2-way into the movie and doesn't let you go. When it finally ""opened my eyes"", I was sincerely shocked. I talked about the movie for close to an hour with friends. When a movie makes you think about it after it's over, that's the mark of a good movie. On par with Memento, but still not to the level of Mulholland Drive, Vanilla Sky will probably end up as one of my favorite movies of the year, and one of those movies that come up in conversations of movies that ""you gotta see"". 8/10.-Mark",Vanilla Sky
151,Sinnerman,You are not alone.,10,23 December 2001,"""How strange the human mind is; this center of activity wherein perceptions of reality are formed and stored, and in which one's view of the world hinges on the finely tuned functioning of the brain, this most delicate and intricate processor of all things sensory. And how much do we really know of it's inner-workings, of it's depth or capacity? What is it in the mind that allows us to discern between reality and a dream? Or can we? Perhaps our sense of reality is no more than an impression of what we actually see, like looking at a painting by Monet, in which the vanilla sky of his vision becomes our reality. It's a concept visited by filmmaker Cameron Crowe in his highly imaginative and consciousness-altering film, `Vanilla Sky,' starring Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz."" (Courtesy of ""jhclues"".

Above commentary excerpt were quoted from an IMDB user. As it somehow offered a better description of 'Vanilla Sky' than anything I could capably come up with, I decided to preface it to my very personal thoughts on a movie which has catapulted itself to be my all-time favourite film.I was overwhelmed with an inexplicable epiphany as I followed the journey of David Aames. With each passing scene, it became alarmingly clear to me that someone out there had an uncanny empathy and intuitive understanding of a particular state of mind. A state of mind that might be momentarily experienced by us all at some points of our life. But that it cut right through me. For, with tears and fears, I have been experiencing what David Aames experienced, for the past twelve years.....No. I am not a deranged schizonerd delighting in psycho babble(thank you very much). But I knew there and then that I am not alone in my 'struggles' and I do not need to be afraid anymore. That somehow, in the process of watching this life affirming film, 'David Aames' has reached out to all the 'Davids' of the world(and you will know who you are). Through it, we are offered an alternative. That is, to take comfort in our experiences and to know that we are free to decide ""whether our glass is half empty or half full?"" And with that realisation, I achieved closure. I was vindicated. And I hope you too will find your way.I do not expect most people to understand what I am trying to say so far, as this personal piece is written with an expressed intention not to reveal vital plot revelation within this mind bending yet spiritually relevant film. But for those who have seen 'Vanilla Sky', if you are experiencing(in whatever doses) what David Aames experienced, do not fear this unknown realm of mindscapes for it is an opportunity for you to free your mind. Take control and despair not. For you are not alone. If you are willing, open your eyes.....",Vanilla Sky
152,Sinnerman,Do I need to convince you I loved Vanilla Sky?,10,29 May 2002,"I don't think so.  Because, God bless all its imperfection, Vanilla Sky is a film which profoundly moved me.Like so many comments posted for contentious films (Fight Club, Magnolia or even LOTR), one interesting observation is the wild displays of bruised egos, cursing detractors for not ""getting"" it. Well, this ""bruised"" ego has no hidden agenda. I do not profess to unleash mind domination on those who don't ""get"" it (Hell, I don't ""get"" it either). Just your time to read my simple piece will do. Spoilers Alert.... Picture the scene when David Aames mentioned how dreams can taunt you, imprison your fears and much more cruelly, your sadness. To many, this was a most insignificant moment. But being a lucid dreamer with end-stage neurosis(i.e. yours truly), those simple words bore such piercing truth, I was stunned by its intuition.From the exploration of Metaphysics and Technology, to the finding of ""Truth, Beauty, Freedom and Love""(oops, another movie), much have been said about the themes of Vanilla Sky. But if you ask me(or have read this far, you poor thing...), I would venture to say that a theme which appealed to me is Redemption - ""How every passing minute is a chance to turn it all around"". If a 4X F****** A****** like David Aames gets a second chance at life, so does anybody.The dust has since settled over this ""super-hyped star vehicle""(quote, unquote). Hopefully, people will ""start to read again""! All I ask is for some to attempt discovering the beauty within this mangled mess, cause Vanilla Sky RULES!! Well, now that I have off-loaded my piece of mind unto you unsuspecting folks, I think its time to go to bed. Behold, my closing words: ""Hopefully, you will ""get"" it. But if you don't, you can always pretend you do. Now go forth, my worthy subjects. Spread the word about how good(or bad) this movie truly is. Maybe, just maybe, the world will become a better place(Zzzz%#@**x^!!zzzzz...).",Vanilla Sky
153,SinjinSB,One in a long line of unnecessary hollywood remakes of good foreign films,6,20 November 2002,"This one in a long line of unnecessary hollywood remakes of good foreign films in the last few years...Insomnia, The Ring, The Vanishing to name a few others. The trend disturbs me a little. I don't think there's anything necessarily wrong with remaking movies and there have been some great films that are loose remakes of other films, like A Fistful of Dollars and Scarface. But to me it seems unnecessary to take an already good film and do an almost exact remake of it. For me, the worst one of all time was Gus Van Sant's near exact remake of the masterpiece, Pscyho. I don't see the point, if you're just trying to copy it. I guess the point is to make money, but I'd expect a little more from established movie makers. It's obvious that the director, Cameron Crowe, has originality. He wrote, directed, and even composed original music for his last film, Almost Famous, which happens to be my favorite movie of 2000. Maybe he used up too much on that film, which was semi-autobiographical and needed an easier fix this go round...I'm really not sure. Vanilla Sky itself wasn't awful, but I find it significantly lacking on all levels in comparison to Abre Los Ojos. Vanilla Sky lacks the heart and subtleness of the original. There are a couple things I'd like to mention, but I think it gives too much away. Another downfall is that it's glammed up with big, known faces...Tom Cruise, Kurt Russell, Cameron Diaz. Even Spielberg pops in for a cameo. However, I did find it interesting to see Penélope Cruz play Sofia in both movies, but like everything good thing in Vanilla Sky, it was just ripped off from the original. I think when these lesser known foreign gems are found, they should be brought to the U.S. and given the bigger released they deserve and not just copied. Or at least if you remake a film, do something different with it and not just try and remake the same darn movie. Okay, that's my rant. ** (Out of 4)",Vanilla Sky
154,wuzupn_tb,"See this, Mulholland Drive & Waking Life",8,13 December 2002,"Vanilla Sky was like the Hollywood version of indies that made you think in 2001.  Waking Life was the best of the 3(A+), then Mulholland Drive(A), and then Vanilla Sky (B+).  Tom Cruise shines when his face is smashed.  The movie is definitly well written.  Jason Lee seems out of place...but meh. Cameron Diaz is perfectly obsessive.  I know girls like her.  That character is very realistic.  Penolple Cruz isn't that bad.  This movie is a delight.

155,tomrito,Boy what a ride,9,17 December 2001,"Open your eyes, this was one good movie.  I went to see this film with my wife and we had two completely different takes on it.  I loved it and my wife hated it.  I thought the acting was great, the images were breath taking and the sound track first class.  It was a Indi sci-fi classic, with Tom Cruse in the lead and really good music.  My wife thought it was too long, confusing, and and a waste of time.It must be said that while I love a good Indi film, like say the ""Opposite of Sex"" my wife usually thinks they are too over the top. This film had me going the whole way, first I thought it was a love story, then a murder mystery, then a Psychological thriller, then a sci-fi twister. But the thing I liked most about it was that I could not stop thinking about the film all night.  The images were burnt into my head.  When I first saw the pictures of the girl and her mother and father I wondered why the parents had blond hair. Later in the film when things changed I said OK that explains that.  But then in the end I did not know what was real and what was a dream, even the ending. I asked my wife what she thought and she said ""Who cares"".  I felt like telling her ""Open you eyes"".",Vanilla Sky

I'm not sure even the director knew where he was going with this film either - which works in some cases, but for me this was just one huge trip. I will give kudos to Tom Cruise and his stunning performance - he does passionate scenes of anger, confusion and remorse. Penelope Cruz is wonderful as the shy, coy and mysterious love interest. Throughout the whole movie, you wonder what is reality and what is not. When is David dreaming? When is he awake? Was he ever awake in the first place? If he wasn't awake then what was the point of this all - was this entire movie just a dream? To put it bluntly - I don't know if I see any deep message hidden in the confines of this blur of reality. It's just trippy. One of those movies that I, as an average viewer will never get, just being honest.",Vanilla Sky
158,kyle_c,*** out of ****,7,8 September 2002,"A good effort by Crowe, ""Vanilla Sky"" falls into the trap of trying too hard to be unique.  While there isn't anything that hasn't been done in a psychological thriller before, it is a solid piece of entertainment.  The cast is solid all around, and Cruise delivers an unusually good performance, if maybe a little over the top at times.  It runs on a little too long, at nearly two and a half hours, but manages to remain interesting for most of the time.  Solid effort but one that maybe thinks a little too much of itself.",Vanilla Sky

This failing wrecked the, in any case, poor ""Artificial Intelligence: AI"" and spoils this, otherwise much better, movie. A shame really, because, up to the last half hour, we can enjoy a story that is absorbing and well acted, if rather convoluted. It reaches a point where we could leave the cinema with a pleasurable feeling of mystery. But no, the film goes on to explain every little thing. Not necessary, folks, not necessary.

160,gila_film,Thanks God I watched it closely,8,1 September 2003,"I heard the fuss about `Vanilla Sky' before. Some say well, most say bad. The polemic made me so curious about this movie. So, I decide to give it a chance. Prior the comments that I ever read on IMDB.com make me want to watch closely and I glad I did. Actually, the main idea of `Vanilla Sky' is quite simple, but Cameron Crowe try to reach our attention with a more complicated way, if you know what I mean (see it to your self!).  I understand why many viewers feel deceived by this movie, because their expectation is about to watch an entertaining light movie. Well, they should do the opponent way, just like I did and then they will feel the amusing elements.  I like the way the movie entertains me. Somewhat, similar to what `The Truman Show' did. Watch it with heart and passion and in the end, your expectation is achieved. One thing bother me is the lack of the chemistry between Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. I don't know with Penelope, maybe she should just stand for those Spanish language movies instead.  I worship Cameron Diaz though, because she looks so stunning and got such a fabulous acts. She definitely one of my acting divas. In general, avoid `Vanilla Sky' if you want to watch a light movie (as a regular movie consumer), but a-must-see if you a truly moviegoers.

161,Derache,A ride of all emotions,10,7 August 2019,"This was probably the scariest movie that I have ever watched. There were points when I was shivering. However, this movie wasn't based off one simple emotion or narrative, this was narrative of a whole life. I was nearly crying in some spots, shivering from fear in others, romantically entranced by others. This Movie is one of the best movies that I have personally ever watched and I definitely recommend everyone watches this heavily unrated movie.",Vanilla Sky
162,stevetseitz,"""It's a Wonderful Life"" meets ""Seconds"" meets ""Coma""",9,30 May 2002,"This is painful for me but I'll admit upfront that I haven't seen the original Spanish language film. I'll qualify that by saying I am the type who scoffs at the American re-make of ""The Vanishing"" because it was so inferior to the original.      I have a hunch that this movie stayed pretty close to the INTENTION of the original. Considering the lame American re-makes usually focus on the ""gimick"" of the original rather than give you any kind of true cultural filter on an original story this is a good thing. I know what Cameron Crowe meant when he said the film wouldn't leave his mind. I had a similar experience with the Russian film ""Come and See"" (which I recommend highly). I kept telling people about it until I convinced a friend to watch it with me.     I won't give away to much of the plot, because this film is truly a story. When I say story, I mean more like a novel than a comic book. I will say that Tom Cruise did a great job in this film. I don't think Cruise gets enough respect for his acting because he is good-looking and he's a nice guy. Often people's talents get overwhelmed by popularity. Think of some of the most popular people at your high school. Just BECAUSE they were popular didn't a certain segment of the class despise them? Being popular didn't prevent anyone from being a good person (In fact, maybe being popular just allows you more leeway to show your true character.) The whole cast performs at a high level. Penelope Cruz is enchantingly cute. Cameron Diaz is horrifically attractive and menacingly flirty. Jason Lee is able to emote subtleties that evade many more well known and well regarded actors. Most importantly Crowe has forged a good story with crisp dialogue and a frustrating yet authentic vagueness of real life. It's all shot in a slick way without looking too much like a commercial yet with a definite emphasis on story-telling. I recommend the movie to those who aren't afraid to look a little inward and ask some big questions.",Vanilla Sky
163,MrVibrating,Extraordinary movie,9,11 November 2007,"Vanilla Sky shows that a remake of a European movie doesn't automatically suck. This is largely because Vanilla Sky is pretty much a scene-by-scene copy of the original Spanish Abre los Ojos. The unique thing is, they do a much better job than the Spanish creators. Abre los Ojos get's credit for their cool idea and for a good movie, but Vanilla Sky takes that material and creates more than a brain-twister; it's simply an amazing movie.While the original had good actors, Vanilla Sky has better ones. Maybe it's because it's in English, but I think it's more than that. Tom Cruise plays the role of his lifetime, very believable and also likable as David Aames, the man with everything he could ever wish for. If you think Cruise is just a pretty face, just wait and see and the movie will prove you wrong. Penelop Cruz, returning from Abre los Ojos to repeat her role as Sofia, is cute as a button but in no way superficial. Cameron Diaz is simply scary and shows she handles a dramatic role excellently. The rest of the cast is also very good, down to little details.Direction is nice, with occasional quick cuts but mostly just solid and still interesting. New York always looks good on film and Vanilla Sky is no exception. There is a spectacular scene in the start of the movie that perfectly sets the mood for the movie.The biggest difference between Abre los Ojos and Vanilla Sky is the soundtrack. While Abre los Ojos had an alright soundtrack, Vanilla Sky's one is simply amazing, well worth buying actually. Every scene has a fresh, interesting and suiting choice of music, many songs so out- there for the scene but still very effective. ""Good Vibrations"" is a good example of a song that really shouldn't work, but does.If you're looking for a mystery with some surreal overtones and a very satisfying ending(yes, it all makes sense in the end!), look no further.",Vanilla Sky

This film  is like a cross between Phantom of the Opera, Truman Show, Bergman, Fellini, Play Misty for me, and Falling Down.  It is only worth it if you see a few others that day.  I saw no chemistry either, but there were some twists and turns. It was really grim at times.",Vanilla Sky

Memento did it. The Matrix did it. And now Vanilla Sky has done it.I used to not like Tom Cruise very much. He was always the pretty boy hero type that never interested me. But the last four movies i have seen featuring him have really change my mind, including Collateral (his best work), A Few Good Men (i know it's old but i just saw it recently), The Last Samurai, and Vanilla Sky. He really has become one of the best actors today.As for the movie itself, it is filled with thrills, sex, comedy, twists, and uhh sex. Speaking of sex, it also features two extremely hot women with great supporting roles in Cameron Diaz and Penelople Cruz. The ending really made the whole film click.

Vanilla Sky is one of the hardest pills I've ever had to swallow. For some reason, every movie Tom Cruise is in, it seems every scene of the movie, Cruise is in it! I'm getting way to much of him in this movie and it's irritating, if you like him, then you'll love the cinematic attention he gets. Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz were just boogers in my opinion. I'm not really to hot about promiscuity and multiple girls and all that. In one aspect there is the heavy reality/dream scenario(s) but then there is too much Tom Cruise.

From the opening scene of a deserted Times Square ,right to the twists and turns of the ending. Tom Cruise was perfect in his role of David. He brought an energy and intensity that few actors can transmit through the screen.. The supporting cast was also great..Cameron and Penelope were both beautiful and convincing, but I especially thought Kurt Russell's performance was the best acting he has ever did.., was nice to see him in a non-action film for a change. When you combine the best elements of a Mystery, Drama, Thriller and Sci-Fi in one film, add good Directing and great visuals to go with the excellent acting out of a great story,, well you simply can't go wrong..

168,Manal1987,Wonderful! Just keep Cruise out of the way,8,16 January 2013,"One of the inexplicably underrated movies. Based on the ratings and reviews, I started watching Vanilla Sky reluctantly knowing that I would definitely be disappointed. However, and to my surprise, I was totally awestruck by the smart, dreamy story, the brilliant direction, and the out-of-this-world cinematography.The only letdown though (and the reason behind the two missing stars in the rating) is Tom Cruise's stagy performance. He completely missed out on the soul of the character he is impersonating and turned it into a phony. I understand that David Aames is supposed to be shallow and irresponsible and that the movie is his journey towards self-realization and maturity. The point is that Cruise's overtly theatrical performance and overacting (to stress the character's clumsiness) detached me and kept reminding me that I'm watching a movie.Still I have to watch the allegedly superior Spanish original (Abre Los Ojos) to make a better judgment, but I think Cameron Crowe did a wonderful job adapting this one.",Vanilla Sky
169,emfern13,A Mix of Confusion But Very Entertaining,9,26 May 2002,I just rented Vanilla Sky and it was really well done. Tom Cruise made a good choice by taking this role. This movie was sort of a sleeper but it became a big hit grossing $100 million. Cameron Diaz is a very beautiful actress and displayed some talent in the movie playing a demented girl. Penelope Cruz is a beautiful actress but did not express any talent in this movie. This a really good movie but you need to stick to it and never leave because you will miss something.

170,eamon-hennedy,A rarity. A Hollywood movie with a heart and a brain.,10,23 August 2005,"This is one of those movies for me that gives me a buzz on how perfect cinema can be when it wants to be. Films that have fallen into this philosophy are The Matrix, The Shawshank Redemption, Batman Begins and this film, Vanilla Sky. Clever, intellectual and deeply, deeply moving, this is in my opinion the best film that Cameron Crowe has made and features the finest performance of Tom Cruise's career, more so that Magnolia and Jerry Maguire (even though I love those two films too). It's just that this is a film that you can really bite into, read into, enjoy and interpret in your own way. It's a surprise that this film is like that. It is to all intents and purposes a Hollywood thriller almost, but it transcends that and becomes almost as much of a personal experience for the viewer as it obviously was for Crowe. Crowe directs and writes the movie as the master-crafts man he is, almost in a similar way that Spielberg (who makes a cameo appearance near the start of the movie) and Hitchcock have done with their own films. Everything about this film is right, there is not a single thing wrong with it. From the performances of everyone, from Cruise to Cruz, Jason Lee, Tim Spall and Noah Taylor, to Nancy Wilson's terrific score (the acoustic guitar theme that plays throughout is deeply haunting and moving) and the terrific choices of songs for the soundtrack (one that is right up there with Pulp Fiction and Top Gun), the film is perfect in the extreme, so much so that you simply want to shout from the heavens to everyone that will listen how good it is. The tour de force of the film is the emotions it conveys, because this is quite simply the saddest and poignant film that I have ever seen. I admit, I almost cried my eyes out at the end when David has to chose between going back to his dream world or taking a chance on the real world, one without his beloved Sophia and his vanilla sky. In any other movie this final scene would have been destabilized with lesser hands and possibly have dived into a world of schmaltz and sickening sentimentality, but Crowe keeps it real, as real as a twist taking the movie 150 years into the future can be. That final moment between Cruise and Cruz is the most perfect moment in mainstream cinema.Words cannot describe how much I love this movie. It is perfect, it probes the brains, strains the heart and proves that in Hollywood there will always be room for thought provoking and daring cinema.",Vanilla Sky
171,Pingo-2,Not as actionpacked as Total Recall and not as good as Memento...,7,6 February 2002,"Not as actionpacked as Total Recall and not as good as Memento, but Vanilla Sky do have its own qualities.--- May contain spoilers! ---I haven't seen the film which this one is based upon (Abre los ojos (1997)), so I don't know what is changed and how much. However, Tom Cruise does a good job holding the pieces together, and I actually got surprised at the turning point in the film - something I haven't been by an American movies since... well, I can't remember ANY US-film that actually surprised me and really turned like this one did.Vanilla Sky is much like a non-US-film (foreign film to you Americans!), in the way it tells its story and the pace. It is very non-American in a good way.The story is not original though. The same story is told in Total Recall, and the setting (on Mars) works better there, since its a strange future world anyway. In Vanilla Sky the story (which doesn't unfold completely until about an hour in the movie) feels a bit unreal - actually EVERYTHING feels unreal! Yes, the sky IS Vanilla, and it too is very unreal. Of course everything is made so we shall doubt it, but why make it so obvious doubtable?Not that Vanilla Sky doesn't work - it does. It is in many ways a very fine film. Especially the cast is impressive. Good choices to cast Cameron Diaz and Kurt Russell. They fit perfectly in their roles and make the story something remembarable, but Cruz is a bit, how shall I put it... boring?!Cruise have made some really low and bad films lately. I didn't at all like Eyes Wide Shut, I thought that film was an overlengthed soft-porn. I mean, if you want to show naked people you can at least do it RIGHT. Eyes Wide Shut didn't have a point at all, but Vanilla Sky has! The two films have some similarities when it comes to the first story that we totally belive in the first part of Vanilla Sky. We are told that Cruise's character, David, head of a large corporation has been framed by the evil board of directors; the Seven Dwarfs. This kind of conspiracy is something similar to the conspiracy in Eyes Wide Shut, but here it doesn't get silly and it actually have a very good point to hold the story together.One bad thing about Cruise is that he creates very long movies. Usually I am a big fan of extreme-lengthed films, but only if it is needed to tell the story. THE STAND for instance work as a six hour movie (even though it was made for TV, it works as a movie) but both Vanilla Sky, Eyes Wide Shut and Cruise' Jerry McGuire are too long.Vanilla Sky could have been shortened 15-30 minutes or so, especially in the beginning when it's painfully slow and doesn't really say anything interesting.Vanilla Sky uses some visual tricks to tell its story. It twists and turns the timeline which is very useful to create confusion. This works better in other movies, like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and of course, Memento. In the end, Vanilla Sky uses these tricks just to impress, not to bring the film forward.I was a bit afraid of a silly A.I.-kind of ending, but luckily they skipped it. I hated A.I. since it was awful and boring, and the end-scenes in Vanilla Sky has some similarities, but Vanilla Sky works better and faster and says what it needs to say in the few minutes the end unfolds.If you want to see a fast cool film with brain-experiments and twists and turns, watch Total Recall. Its much better than Vanilla Sky in many ways. However, if you can't stand Arnold or don't want the violence, maybe you should go for Memento. If Memento is too confusing, then sure, Vanilla Sky is totally made for you!I give it a 7 out of 10. Its a good movie, too long, but in the end very interesting.",Vanilla Sky

173,lopcar1993,Amazing film!! One of the bets mind bender's since The Matrix,10,7 October 2009,"This movie was allot of things to me. It was strangely beautiful, oddly touching. Complex, brilliant, stunning , grand, outrageously entertaining; need I go on? Vanilla Sky was a movie at first I didn't think I would like but after awhile I saw that there was more too it than meet's the eye. It was a very touching movie in an odd sense it shows you the trails and tribulations of a man trying to grasp whether or not his world is real or a dream.There are things in life we don't quite understand and there are things we do, this film explores the latter it explores the perception that our world does sometimes seem like a dream and that things we do and things we don't can effect the realm of our imagination and the realm of our life. This movie doves deep into the physic of the human mind and it plucks at every sense and every feeling to provoke the main stimulus of our mind and it does it so well with such style and artistic beauty, It's a quintessential movie that mus be seen with an open mind and heart to fully comprehend the complex nature of it's story and it's deeper underlined meaning that is unearthed as the story moves along. It's astoundingly well made and crafted and is something that is going to become a classic as time goes on.Tom Cruise(who was utterly fantastic here.) delivers one of his most potent and brilliant performances as wealthy playboy David Aames, Jr. an successful publisher who finds his whole life turned upside down. Kurt Russell does as just a good job as Cruise in his forceful performance as the compassionate psychiatrist who becomes a father figure to Cruise and brings Cruise's character out of his dark place. It's a great father son type of relationship to see unfold on screen. Penelope Cruz does amazing here she's so graceful and beautiful and is something amazing to watch on screen, she's fantastic! But the real weak point in this film was Cameron Diaz, her performance was so annoying and bland that when she died you showed no pity what so ever. But besides that the rest of the cast holds up very nicely and does a fantastic job.This movie is a mind bending, melting pot of a film it's meant to bring out the most elated feeling of power and sorrow from the deepest part's of your mind. It's a film you can't miss at all it's amazing, breath taking, dark and so entertaining to watch. Vanilla Sky is a shoot out the lights , blow your hair back, mind blowing experience you have just got to see. All in all Vanilla Sky is a wild trip you'll want to take.",Vanilla Sky
174,paul_supercala,Another great Crowe film definitely worth catching in the theatre...,9,11 December 2001,"Cameron Crowe has delivered us another amazing film. This is very close to being his best one yet. With incredible performances from Tom Cruise and Kurt Russell and solid support from Cameron Diaz and Jason Lee, the casting couldn't have been better. You can also almost see the true-life romance unfold between Cruise and co-star Penelope Cruz. Actually an adaptation of the 1997 Spanish film ""Abre los Ojos"", this ""Americanized"" version is even more interesting in the original. Tom Cruise is surprisingly believable as a disfigured man who has trouble deciphering what is or is not real. The film takes the viewer on a roller coaster ride that never really slows down in its 2 1/2 hour run. It has moments that might be hard for many to follow and also leaves you to draw your own conclusions, which might drive some people crazy. It never really follows the structure of a standard ""multiplex"" film, which is also why it is so enjoyable and refreshing. Crowe has shown us how he can shine commercially with ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Say Anything"", but has really gone out on a limb with this one. Some might compare it to ""Magnolia"", which isn't such a bad thing, but it is a little confusing at times. The ending is also a little strange and will sit well with some and not others. Also worth mentioning is the soundtrack, which works along with the film in a way the only a few others, like Paul Thomas Anderson, have done in the past. Some of the haunting and beautiful images are intensified by the importance of the music in the scene. This one is definitely worth checking out in the theatre if you're going to see it at all. For fans of Cameron Crowe, this will be well worth it for you. For everyone else, it is important to remember to keep an open mind when seeing this. The film is definitely well made; it's just not the typical flashy blockbuster Tom Cruise fans may have come to expect.",Vanilla Sky
175,WCS02,"Bring your imagination, intellect and your sense of wonder to this film, along with a date.",9,14 December 2001,"Bring your imagination, intellect and your sense of wonder to this film, along with a date if someone's handy.  You will need all four  the latter critical to talk through your impressions and the film's possibilities over a nice café mocha after the show.  It's not another date movie of the kind Hollywood routinely churns out. There's a lot to like about this movie.  It demands to be watched ""Closely!"" Open your eyes . . .  (where'd I here that?)   Now there's nothing wrong with shallow fare like say 'Something about Mary' and 'Shallow Hal'.  To all flicks, a purpose.  Those are frolicks.  This one is more akin to philosophical lecture, where the professor insists you learn by immersing yourself in the experience.  Each has entertainment value.  This one simply demands your full attention to Get It.  The only hokey thing about the movie is the Cameron-Cameron / Cruise-Cruz thing.  That aside, it blazes bravely into Kubrickian surrealistic territory, a risky departure from the entertaining, mainstream achievements of Mr. Crowe to date . . . Virtually anything he slaps up on the screen will attract an audience by reputation and prior achievements.  Know that this one is a journey worth taking, if you bring at least 3 of the 4 elements first noted above.  Criticism: It could easily have been clipped 20 minutes and retain every bit of its storyline, character development and film personality.  I suppose with three blockbuster successes decorating his resume, Cameron (Crowe) likely earned his editorial license.  Length mattered.  Why not 120 minutes now; and 150 on the redux 20 years hence, like Coppola did it.  This film will become a classic. Whether 120 or 150, I liked them all.  Check it out.",Vanilla Sky

But when you watch by OPENING YOUR EYES, it will become interesting. Tom Cruise's acting is very good and he has put emotions at right place.Just two cons are there:-1) As I said before, it might seem long and boring in the starting. The makers could have avoided cringe at the beginning.

179,RolloTomasi,A twist without a plot,4,27 December 2001,"""Vanilla Sky"" is not an easy film to like, an art film disguised as an event film. I'd argue that a project like this is the sort of thing that SHOULD be what we consider an 'event,' because it's actually interesting. Whatever your opinion of this film is, it's worth a discussion.
Being a star is about many things--recognizability, mystery, attraction, but probably most of all, trust.  That is, audiences feel 'safe' going to a Tom Cruise film--any Tom Cruise film. When will people ever learn? Consider three of Cruise's last four films, ""Magnolia,"" ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" and now ""Vanilla Sky."" None of the trio are exactly audience pleasers (personally, I hated ""Mission: Impossible 2""). They're odd, intricate pieces featuring odd, intricate characters. Like ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" ""Sky"" comes wrapped in a nice package. The former: Stanley Kubrick's last film and another pairing of wife Nicole Kidman; the latter: Camerons Crowe and Diaz, plus the (arguably) rising Penelope Cruz. With this kind of star power, many filmgoers willingly enter ""Sky"" knowing next to nothing about what they're in for. They're usually the first ones to hurl their super-size buckets of popcorn at the screen in anguish halfway through.No popcorn became airborne at the screening I attended. There was, however, a couple near me who insisted on talking to each other through the entire second half of the movie. Normally this would annoy me a great deal. 'This better start making sense real fast,' the girl would say to her companion. He would try to explain what was going on perhaps not realizing we could hear every word of it. In this particular instance, I can't say I blame this girl, whoever she was. Personally, I've never asked myself 'what the heck is going on?' more in a film than I did during ""Vanilla Sky."" The only incentive to keep watching was Cruise, who gives one of his best performances. As for the story, all is revealed eventually, but it takes a major test of patience to get there. This is the point for me where having seen Alejandro Amenabar's ""Open Your Eyes"" would have been helpful, but I'll do my best. Having seen his really, really great film ""The Others,"" however, will do for now. It provides the example I need to illustrate my point. ""Others"" is recognizable as a ghost story and makes sense, whether you know what's REALLY going on or not. You understand the themes that are being presented. Depending on how observant you are, you may even be able to predict the ending before Amenabar pulls the rug out from under you.  Based on Amanabar's own criteria, ""Vanilla Sky"" stinks. People watch movies to be entertained, to see a story, for two hours give or take. They don't go to have nonsense hurled at them for two hours and then have that nonsense explained to them for the last fifteen minutes in a bunch of exposition by talking heads. There's no rug to pull out because Crowe forgets to even put one under you. The only possibility of enjoying this would be on a second viewing. That should never be the case. Of course, next I'll actually see the film ""Sky"" is based on, which supposedly is all but a carbon copy of it, and I like it. No matter how similar the two films are, they are still two different films, made in different countries by different directors, with different actors (except Cruz). Wanting to make an avant-garde, thinking piece is noble, but Crowe, who had always been reliable, bricks this one.  File ""Vanilla Sky"" under interesting,' fascinating,' ambitious,' but not good.'

I thought Cruise was particularly good, and the best thing about the movie. Diaz is also good. Penelope Cruz, however, hasn't seemed to have found her acting ability quite yet. Either that or she's taking roles she doesn't play well. Anyway I enjoy some movies like this, that confuse you greatly and bring it all together in the end. The problem was  that I really wasn't that satisfied on the big twist that came in the end. It's far from a bad movie, just not on the level for me as say an Eyes Wide Shut.

181,evilmatt-3,Nicely paced thriller; not exactly original,8,24 December 2001,"Overall, I liked this.  It was pretty intelligent most of the time, despite a tendency to talk down to the audience.  Probably the most notable thing about this film is its unyielding romanticism regarding the universe, which is admirable in any film these days.This film owes a LOT, though, to David Lynch.  The plot structure, characters, and thematics felt like they were all ripped from Lynch's films. Crowe not so subtly pulls in elements from Blue Velvet, Lost Highway, and the recent Mulholland Drive to tell his story.  This naturally puts Crowe in a harsh light, since his use of the elements is not nearly so masterful as Lynch's.  Instead of a stream of consciousness film about the human condition, we have one that paints itself into a corner and then struggles fervently to get out- although it should be noted that the film DOES succeed, the ending only passes the credibility test by the skin of its teeth.That said, this is worth seeing.  Certainly one of the better films to come out lately.",Vanilla Sky

In reality it is totally not what I expected it to be.It's a very bizarre movie that starts off quite normally but then turns into a sci-fi flick. It's full of strange twists and turns and flips itself on it's head quite a lot. For me it's too bizarre and confusing for my liking. I never really got a grasp of what what going on and then the ending was pretty disappointing. It felt like a movie that was trying to be too clever for it's own good and in the end it kind of failed. Don't get me wrong I usually love twisty sci-fi movies but this wasn't my cup of tea.Tom Cruise was Tom Cruise. For me he's a good looking guy but I'm not convinced about his acting and so his performance was average. In fact there weren't really any fantastic stand out performances in this one. Penelope Cruz was hot. But Cameron Diaz was probably the pick of the bunch if I had to choose one.Overall a pretty disappointing movie that didn't rock my world.6/10",Vanilla Sky
183,crypticcrytic,Vanillasky?,6,20 December 2001,"Open your eyes. This overly ambitious film (not the sequel to ""Eyes Wide Shut"") gives us so much and asks so little in return. Another Hollywood cruise through dreamland that turns out a nightmare or just another Tom Cruise vehicle? David Aames ((Tom Cruise) wakens to a NYC beyond his wildest fantasy - a city devoid of people making him the one and only. But that's only a dream... or is it? This self-absorbed magazine-magnate demands your attention. This is a narcissistic heir to a successful publishing house doing his least to promote its rags and his best to advance his own interest. You've met his type - a guy born on third base who thought he hit a triple. Tom Cruise, producer, cast himself in this role and are we surprised. A match made in heaven as we watch him descend to hell.Vanilla Sky should be sub-titled and programmed for the intuitively challenged. To follow this film in a linear fashion is a prescription for almost as much pain and suffering as our hero experiences without the rewards of both Julie (Cameron Diaz) and Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz). The hangover without the fun. This film has more beautiful people per frame than any audience deserves. And Mr. Cruise, please stop mugging to the audience.The opening line - ""Open your eyes""  -surprisingly the title of the derivative film by Alejandro Amenabar - is the appropriate wake up call to the audience after two hours of real/dream world transcendence. What was Cameron Crowe thinking when he inserted a 5-minute - or was it 15 - monologue at the end of a 2-hour terror trip? There might be more satisfying ways to clarify the plot but this sure must be the easiest.Unless you are a fan of Cruise or Cruz you may have a hard time sympathizing with their characters. Personally I have Cruise Control and sympathize with supporting characters like Brian Shelby (Jason Lee), David's best friend who (might) get trampled by David's dating games. Or was that David's dream world?  And at that point, who cares?Is there a moral to this tale? I'm having the same trouble ending this review as Crowe had with ending his film.  Vanillasky?

185,Thunderbuck,(much) better than average...,9,24 December 2001,"I'm not seeing this film popping up in many ""10 Best"" lists, or in the Golden Globe nominations, for that matter.  Pity...I saw this film last week, and found it nicely exceeded my admittedly low expectations.  In a year where most of the successful blockbusters seemed to be kiddie-fare (""Shrek"", ""Harry Potter""), it was refreshing to see a good, adult movie that didn't have to hit you over the head with a sledgehammer to underline its various plot-points.I liked the challenging nature of the story, and I found I enjoyed it best when I just let it sort of ""wash over me"", instead of trying to analyze every detail and plot point.  And while I wouldn't go so far as to call it profound, it WAS a nifty piece of story-telling.I do have quibbles; the ""elevator"" scene near the end goes into WAY much detail to explain what has happened, and winds up insulting the thoughtful viewer's intelligence when the movie had done such a wonderful job of depending on it up to that point.Even with this, though, I liked and admired Vanilla Sky.  Its labrynthine narrative is a BIG departure for director Cameron Crowe, even with its artistic ambitions manages to be approachable and entertaining.  When my wife and I left the theatre we talked for a good hour or so just trying to piece together exactly what happened.A last note: I've seen some mention of the presence of the World Trade Center twin towers in the background skyline in the rooftop scene at the end.  While this was very much a background detail with NO relevance to the story whatsoever, and while seeing it was a little distracting, I'm glad it was left in.  I'm sure there was much handwringing at Paramount over whether to digitally alter those frames, and the argument could be made that doing so would have been appropriate, but it stands almost as a small, cinematic memorial.  This may well be the last new film we'll see that uses the image of the twin towers as simple buildings, and not as symbols of tragedy.",Vanilla Sky

187,bedazzle,patronizing,7,11 January 2002,"Spoilers, interpretation:I really liked this movie until the patronizing ending. The audience is treated like morons. The movie ends, and then for some reason the makers feel the need to tack on an extra forty-five minutes to explain the movie. Maybe they thought it'd make more money if it was dumbed down a bit? Possibly, but I think the biggest motivating factor was the need for a more romanticized ending. You can't very well let the audience leave in a gloomy mood because they think David will remain in his nightmare forever, can you?
I can tell you how to fix this movie: just don't add any unnecessary emotionalism. Don't lie to the audience and pretend that this a happy movie. To do this, there is a simple solution: end the movie when David takes his psychologist to L.E. Go all the way through with the little movie presentation, and then have the psychologist ask David once again, ""Did you sign something with these people?"" David looks on with a blank/confused/terrorized face, and the movie ends. This is the ideal ending because at this point, everything in the movie is explained. Instead we get forty-five minutes of re-explanation, patronization.Yet there are two new sub-themes added in the extra time. They are new, unnecessary, and done for the sake of drama, melodrama really. First, David kills himself. There is absolutely no reason for this. He has a malady that cannot be fixed, therefore he could just as easily have himself frozen without the suicide. David's death is contrived pathos. It also works to consummate his relationship with Sofia. Aww, how nice, she still loves him, ""she knew him better than anyone else"" even though she only saw him once - more pathos. Second, there is the ending in which David decides that real life is better than dream, continuing along in that naive Matrixesque vein. Again, this is just pointless melodrama because tragedies don't sell. It's dishonest and denial and patronizing , but ""the answer to 99 of 100 questions is money.""Two flagrant examples of patronization. First, the L.E. lady tells David that he can be forever in a dream and David asks, ""Couldn't it be a nightmare?"" Moments later he reaches an epiphany and shouts ""This is a nightmare!"" Second, standing on the roof, David asks, ""I set up this whole scenario didn't I?"" ""Yes,"" the dream technician replies, ""you had to face your fear of heights."" These are examples of stating the obvious, spelling it out for you, treating you like children, that the ending is wrought with.
Technical problems. In cryonization, the brain is dead. Hence, no dreams are possible. A coma would have been the rational choice. Plus it would have added interest to have the entire movie last one moment (""You can change your life in a moment"") than 150 years; not to mention the fact that it would have made Sofia's ""Hello David"" upon awakening realistic. Also, there is the problem that by definition, a lucid dream is one that the dreamer is aware he is having. The movie makes it seem that the entire dream is lucid, while only the ending, after he returns to L.E. is.During the movie I was planning on giving it a 9, but after that ending I lowered my rating to a 7. The fact that I'm more of an interpreter than a reviewer probably plays a role.",Vanilla Sky
188,Erewhon,"Ponderous, pretentious failure",4,12 December 2001,"Tom Cruise is very good, as are several of the other actors (Russell, Diaz, Cruz), but Cameron Crowe fails to create any sense of excitement.  The pacing is extremely slow, with long pauses between lines of dialog, and slow pacing of movement and action within the scenes.  Also, the story shuttles back and forth between what may be dream and what may be reality so often that after a while, the audience simply ceases to care whether what they're watching is ""real"" or not.     The idea is hardly original.  Yes, this is a remake, but the basic ideas of the story go back to 1940s pulp magazines, where they were usually developed in a more compelling and exciting fashion.     Crowe wanted to call the far superior ""Almost Famous"" ""Vanilla Sky,"" which indicates just how meaningless the title is.",Vanilla Sky

190,Snoopy1,Ugh...,5,31 March 2003,"SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!I didn't particularly like this movie.  The cinematography was great, the acting was great, soundtrack was great...the story was weak.  First off, it was built up like a psychological film, and then suddenly became a fantasy. It took too long to let you know it was a fantasy, and then when you look back on it...it just doesn't seem to fit or flow well.  The whole LE thing seemed STUPID and SILLY...far from thought provoking.  I felt disappointed, gypped, and most of all, unsatisfied.  There was no real conclusion to the film...and oftentimes when a story lacks a conclusion it still leaves you wondering about things.  I didn't wonder anything.  I simply did not care. 
The movie would have been a lot more enjoyable to me had the whole lucid dream BS been in Tom Cruise's mind.  To me, the human mind is far more disturbing and twisted than than the Life Extension thing.Again, I think this is another movie that people tend to enjoy simply because it's artsy.  Artsy, maybe it was...but that was just because of the cinematography.  The plot was not artistic, like I said, it was silly and full of holes.  I'd just as soon watch GROUNDHOG DAY.  That movie actually seemed more properly thought out than this collosal mess!",Vanilla Sky
191,cartesianthought,It's a wide mix of different genres.,9,19 December 2015,"This criminally underrated gem got sour reviews because most viewers were expecting a typical romantic comedy with Tom Cruise and ended up getting something completely different. Instead of a story about a wealthy arrogant man who lost it all and has to learn humility, it shifts in a completely different direction ever so slowly. It's hard to follow and its numerous twists will hit you like a bullet, but the volatility of this movie makes it a complete joy. Vanilla Sky is one of the most ambitious mix of genres you could possibly imagine: romance, drama, thriller, mind-bender, sci-fi and others. It's colorful, beautiful, a little disturbing and above all, it's deeply fascinating.",Vanilla Sky
192,PeteRoy,"Good movie, worth watching",1,14 March 2003,"I liked this movie. And one of the aspects I check when I watch a movie is the time I find myself bored in a movie and I can say that in this movie I wasn't bored for one moment. It is a mystery movie with interesting story and excellent actors playing well.Everyone who loved Matrix, Fight Club and John Malkovich will like this one because I found stuff in it which reminded it all 3 and I rathar not say cause it can spoil the movie.Enjoy.",Vanilla Sky
193,MovieDude1893,Crowe's Stylistic Apex,10,29 November 2008,"It begins with sweeping overhead shots of a New York City slowly succumbing to the chill of late fall. As the camera moves closer, it seems to blink and on the soundtrack we hear the first dialog of the film. ""Open your eyes"" followed by the foreboding tones of Radiohead's Everything in its Right Place.The opening of Vanilla Sky immediately begins to separate itself from every film in Cameron Crowe's cannon. This is a film of delicate construction and careful planning.The setup is simple enough: young playboy David Aames (Tom Cruise) is on top of the world. He has inherited control of all three of his father's magazines, and all the other ""keys to the kingdom"". David can have any woman he wants, including his personal friend with ""benefits"" Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz), however he is caught off guard when he meets Sofia (Penelope Cruz). They spark an immediate bond and spend the night having a deep conversation like only Crowe can write. (Of course this is set to the tune of Solsbury Hill.) This sparks jealousy in Julie, who in a single action sends the film through the looking glass and into a world of murder, dreams and psychedelia.Vanilla Sky was initially released in 2001, a very good year for the certain type of film that requires numerous viewings to unwrap and dissect the riddles they present. In a single year we had Nolan's Memento, Kelly's Donnie Darko and this film. The former two films have gained a substantial cult following (#28 and #124 on IMDb's Top 250 respectively) however, Vanilla Sky remains the best and most undervalued film of that trio.The film is Crowe's first true directorial triumph, not his best film but his most stylistically advanced and intoxicating. In Vanilla Sky Crowe brings a mash of pop culture as signposts within the film. Keep an eye out for tiny details such as programs on T.V. or ringtones of a phone. He designs shots to subconsciously resemble classic images. However, this visual growth doesn't undercut the reliables in Crowe's bag of tricks. Vanilla Sky includes every Crowe staple: dialog that seems to immediately enter the lexicon, carefully drawn characters, subtle character driven humor and of course the achingly perfect soundtrack. Yet, I view as completely reliant on Crowe's previous film, Almost Famous. With that film Crowe sharpened his production values only to unleash them at their apex here. In Famous Crowe mastered the art of clear storytelling, allowing him to play with the structure of the medium with Vanilla Sky.The performances are also of a higher level. Cruise sheds all of his Maguire-tics to create a character that begins with all the answers and by the end has none of them left. Diaz brings a fierce believability to her role. And perhaps most surprisingly, Kurt Russell (as David's shrink) brings his uniquely human charm to a role that will be perceived in new ways by the end credits.Although only seven years old, Vanilla Sky has emerged in my mind as a great film of many layers. I've seen it countless times, yet with each viewing it continues to reveal further depths. I fear it may forever remain a mystery; however I am confident that it will stay an intricate and confounding masterwork.",Vanilla Sky
194,DorianWynHowells,"Great plot, and great cast make this a must see film!",9,1 February 2002,"I always thought that Tom Cruise was a pretty boy. I automatically hated him......then I saw his performance of Jerry Maguire, and he was exceptionally good. I then rented Magnolia, and he was good in that too, so since then I've began taking an interest in his films from MI:2 through to this film - VANILLA SKY.I made sure I went into this film as cold as a turkey - I didn't want to see any trailers for the film, I hadn't read any reviews, so I didn't really hav a clue what to expect, and I'm soooooooo glad, because I think I appreciated the film far more.This film, may I say is very, very good. It has a great script - even though it's a remake, don't hold that against it! The storyline is very cleverly wrapped around one single event in David Aames' life. Cruise shines in his role, giving a performance which ranges from - dashingly smug, depressed, in complete love, confusion, frustration, etc etc. Yep, it's all here (almost!). His character goes through so much that you MUST give him credit for it.Cruz is actually very good in this film - I liked her in 'Blow' with Johnny Depp - she does well here, reprising her role from the original, and giving it a fresh new feel, and to top it all - I can UNDERSTAND what she is saying!!Cameron Diaz is equally as good, if not better as the suicidal, and crazed Julie. Her role was quite a challenge I suspect, as she could have easily gone down the one dimensional 'unhinged stalker' path and given a crap performance, but she doesn't, she keeps it controlled, and unnerving. A career performance from her in which is a vital role to the film as a whole.Kurt Russell? I've always liked Kurt, and he doesn't dissapoint here, he is strong in his role and come the end, I don't even think he knew what was happening, and to show that on screen, is truly something to behold.And finally, Cameron Crowe. He has, with this film, proved himself to be more than a 'feel good' director. He has created a world which will captivate his audience. His opening of a completely deserted Times Square is unforgettable - David Aames is a character that fears being alone, and what sense of loneliness would you feel if everything in Times Square came to a stop? Phew! But, that's just the BEGINNING! When we are drawn in even deeper to Aames' world, we are as disillusioned and as confused as he is! I won't give plot details away here, but just don't try to think too much during this film - it'll all be explained to you come the end, and if you are NOT moved to shed at least one tear, then get yourself checked into the closest asylum!!!****PLOT SPOILER - I THINK**** After Aames' tragic car crash, which some might say had it coming, we witness the 'Golden boy's' transformation, and by God is it very realistic. The make-up is great, and I never once questioned the fact that it WAS make-up. Cruise's performance and the way his 'new face' sits on him is shocking. Of course, the first initial shock of seeing him look the way he does after the accident does wear off eventually, but it does come back to haunt us as it does to David himself. Very clever.So, to conclude - this film succeeds in all levels of genre that it undertakes - romance, thriller, comedy, and even sci-fi to a degree. It has a good, strong plot coupled with strong actors and characters. Mix  all this up with a cracking soundtrack, and a director who knows what he wants and never insults his audience, and you have a film that will make you consider your everyday actions, value other people's feelings, and make one hell of a pub conversation or two.This is the best film I have seen in a long long time!!""Without the sour, the sweet ain't as sweet.""A good line, and one I can fully relate to!9/10Enjoy!",Vanilla Sky
195,superboy478,A Spellbinding Thriller,8,17 April 2002,"This movie is a remake of a spanish film and is also one of the top 5 movies on my list for 2001.David (Tom Cruise) is an author who is shown respect all of the time. He isn't married, but he has a sex partner named Julie (Cameron Diaz) who he doesn't really have feelings for. One night at his birthday party, his best friend (Jason Lee) shows up with a date. Her name is Sophia (Penelope Cruz), she is a beautiful dancer. When David meets her, she invites him back to her apartment which leads to him spending the night. By morning, Julie is in front of Sophia's apartment waiting for David. She offers him a ride which he accepts. During the ride, the jealous Julie drives her car off a bridge which ends up leaving her dead and David is left grusomely disfigured. He trys his best to win Sophia back even with being ugly. She becomes confused on what she should do. Meanwhile, the doctors give David a pure vanilla colored mask to hide his face. As the movie goes by, David becomes more and more desperate and crazy thinking that Julie has come from hell and is out to get him back for what he did. He feels that he needs to turn to God for help. He feels that he needs to travel to heaven and speak with God.Written and directed by the critically acclaimed Cameron Crowe (Jerry Maguire, Almost Famous) and starring Tom Cruise (Minority Report), Cameron Diaz (Shrek 2, Charlies Angels 2), Penelope Cruz (Blow, Woman on Top), Kurt Russel (Captain Ron, Overboard), Jason Lee (Enemy of the State, Dogma).Vanilla Sky is one of the best movies of 2001 and is a must see.",Vanilla Sky

197,Gjay2,more art than film,8,27 March 2003,"Wow, easily one of the best films of 2002. With a high profile director, and a very high profile star, it could've all gone wrong for this film, but it seems to do everything right. The plot takes so many turns it's sometimes hard to keep up, but isn't it better that a movie makes you think rather than not? Cameron Crowe has made his best film here, and it's most likely to be the best film of his career in many years to come. Using colour and some fantastic camera shots, it becomes more of an art piece than just a film. His direction and editing are so tight in some scenes, it's hard not to notice his talent. Check out the scene with tom cruise and noah taylor in the bar. It's perfectly executed. And the finale is positively poetic. Beautiful infact. Everyone here makes an impression. Penelope Cruz i thought did extremely well in a soft role, and tom cruise once again shows us that he can infact act his socks off if he wants to. It's brain numbing, head scratching, wonderfully surreal, disturbing, horrific, romantic, poetic, arty, everything really. Oh and not to forget that is has possibly the best soundtrack ever put on film. Sigur ros, icelands premier band make the ending with it's glorious track 4.",Vanilla Sky
198,ayric,Interesting Copy,7,21 December 2001,"I have no problem with remakes like Ocean's Eleven as they update old ideas. It is a little harder to accept Hollywood remakes of recent, successful foreign movies. The original is Abre los Ojos, which was made in 1997. What Hollywood does in these cases is a common phenomenon, popularly referred to as theft. That aside, let's concentrate on the movie as it turned out.Many confusing films have popped up after The Sixth Sense. This is certainly one of them and I have heard many complaints that people left the theatres puzzled. This should, however, not be necessary as I think the plot is very well explained in the end. I even feel a little too much may have been explained, but it is still of the more intelligent sorts of movies. It is highly entertaining and Crowe is a master of portraying warmth and he shows this particularly well in the ending. The problem with the film is that it is originally a Spanish movie. Latino countries often embrace the incredible and the mystical in their movies, and it somehow works better when they make these movies. Here, it feels sort of weird.Cruise has long ago become a mature and excellent actor. His character in Vanilla Sky is almost as written by Bret Easton Ellis. Pay particular attention to when he is introduced to his new mask by the medical team. The flaw, if I can call it that, with his character is his choice of women. I am skeptical to any person who would choose Penélope Cruz over Cameron Diaz, although that is what Cruise did in real life. Choosing her over Nicole Kidman is not much better though. ;-) Also, Jason Lee and Kurt Russell make good impressions.This is a high adrenaline movie with excellent music, and if you aren't tired of the Sixth Sense effect yet, this is not a bad bet.
PS! The introductory scene with Tom Cruise in a completely empty Times Square is not only impressive, it is also quite real. Rating: 7/10",Vanilla Sky
199,bobbyelliott,A movie with something to say,8,4 February 2002,"This is an unusual and interesting movie - that improves the longer it goes on. I thought that first hour or so was a little slow - but more than made up for by the last 30 minutes. The film is about actions-and-consequences - which makes a change from Hollywood's usual fixation with ""fate"". It has this in common with another Cruise movie - Magnolia - which (among its many themes) was also about choices - and their consequences. This movie is about something important - hang in there and you'll get it. Good acting (even from TC), great music and the two leading women - wow!",Vanilla Sky
200,Clive-Silas,"Worth a look, but fails to go for the jugular.",6,3 January 2004,"A reasonably intelligent psychological examination of the nature of love, lust and life in general. Experienced movie goers get clued in to the kind of film we're watching right from the opening when Cruise cruises around a deserted New York. In some ways this was probably a mistake since, although a lot of what happens seems to make no sequential sense, we already know to distrust what we see. This detracts from the emotional involvement required to get the maximum impact. I personally didn't even believe that Sophia was remotely real and was quite surprised to discover that she did, in fact, exist.Stories of this nature are more satisfyingly terrifying when the ultimate basis of the main character's experience is psychological. Unwilling to go all the way, the makers of this movie draw the tooth of insanity by creating a pseudo-science fiction explanation for all that has gone before. As is frequently the case when people not fully versed in the genre attempt science fiction, this story has a gaping logical hole in it, which need be plugged only with a single line of explanatory dialogue which was not forthcoming. We are all familiar with the concept of cryogenic freezing of a corpse after death, with the idea of being revived in the distant future when the battle against death itself has been won by our descendants. But this film takes the idea one step further - that you can spend your ""death"" living out a fantasy - a ""Lucid Dream"". What they completely fail to explain is how exactly a dead person, a corpse with a dead brain, which is being deep frozen in order to cease all activity and the changes wrought by time to enable revival centuries hence; how such a dead body, then, is supposed to *experience* the said Lucid Dream. Such an ability represents a victory against death even better than physical revival would be. You wouldn't even wait to die in order to experience a perfect life from whatever moment you wish, you'd pay large amounts of money to experience such a thing without dying. So why bother with the antiquated idea of cryogenic freezing of the corpse after death (necessitating Aames to have undertaken a suicide that was impossible to believe in, knowing the character) when he could simply have decided to get frozen and live a better life?Tom Cruise is very good as the man who sees a different kind of life possible through the sight and brief encounter with Sophia, and later excellent as a man dealing with the solitary life of a disfigured man. However, Penélope Cruz is considerably less adept at displaying exactly what it is supposed to be that Cruise is falling in love with, although this is really down to her part being underwritten.To the user whose comment asked for a response to his theory that the whole thing was an examination of David Aames fear and rejection of his own love for Julie (Cameron Diaz's character), I'm afraid that user has been blinded by the fact that the woman is played by Cameron Diaz. There is absolutely nothing in the film or in her performance to suggest that she is anything but the villainess of the piece, the ultimately suicidal, violently obsessive stalker that she is intended to be. Diaz plays the part very well and courageously, and any attempt to see her character as being any better than she is supposed to be is basically a detrimental opinion of her performance.",Vanilla Sky
201,johnklem,Glossy but emotionally subpar remake,6,4 February 2015,"I revisited Vanilla Sky recently. I wondered if my early impressions of the film might be ripe for revision. In one way they were. I came away from my second viewing with a clearer idea of the film's strengths and weaknesses. Vanilla Sky begins with a disadvantage. It's an almost frame by frame remake of the hugely successful and widely admired Spanish film Abre Los Ojos and so actively invites comparison. That's been done and I can't add anything meaningful to the debate. But since Vanilla Sky was made, there has been a rash of similarly themed movies, books and (in Britain at least) radio plays. Judged by these standards, the movie fares quite well. It's beautifully made. Everything and everyone looks wonderful. The girls in particular are perfectly cast and bring serious emotional power to their scenes. If you don't think Cameron Diaz can act, take a look at her scene with Cruise in the car. It'll send shivers up and down your spine. But that emotional punch is ultimately what the film lacks. It's the missing ingredient and the fault lies with Cruise. As the rich and impossibly charming playboy inheritee of his daddy's publishing empire, he's note perfect. Of course. Tom Cruise has made a career out of knowing his strengths and is rightly the most commercially successful actor of the last few decades. There's no denying his commitment to his craft and what serious actor could resist the lure of Charles Laughton's crown as the king of prosthetic pathos but it's the undoing of this film. All the training, all the practice, all the sheer willpower in the world cannot prepare you for a role like this. And that's the point. The role is pivotal and Cruise is not the actor to invest it with a full emotional life. Frankly, it's hard to think who would have been a better choice. Without Cruise, the film might never have been made and anyway, he's not the movie's only problem. Kurt Russel's responsible for some cringeworthy mugging, better suited to a bad daytime soap. Would I rather the film hadn't been made? No, it brought the story to a wider audience and has its own strengths. I doubt that it will be remade any time soon but if it were, I wonder what Tom Hardy would make of that central role.",Vanilla Sky
202,LaurieMann,An Interesting Effort,6,14 December 2001,"This is not a great movie, but it held my attention for the most part.Cameron Crowe is generally very much an actor's director, but he went into the stratosphere with the script and it's hard to tell if he succeeded or not.  I suppose I'd like to see it again to make sure! In light of the views of reality in this movie, I'd be curious to see what he would do with Neil Gaiman's American Gods, should that novel ever be optioned for a film.  And I'd definitely like to rent the Spanish film that served as the film's inspiration and supplied the ever-evocative Penelope Cruz as the female lead, playing the same part she had in the original (is that the first time this has ever happened?).Tom Cruise really did not impress me in this movie, with the exception of one scene very near the end.  I'm not sure what it is about Cruise - he's given some incredible performances in a few movies, notably Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire.  He and Crowe work well together.  He was a convincing narcissist during the first third of the film, but he really had enormous trouble playing a man whose life was ruined.******SPOILERS/SPOILERS/SPOILERS**********The very first voice you hear in the movie is Penelope Cruz saying ""Open Your Eyes.""  But, ""in reality,"" Tom Cruise is having a dream and hasn't met the character of Sofia ""yet.""The next voice you hear is Cameron Diaz saying the same thing, only this time it's ""reality.""That made me think that, perhaps, the whole movie was one long dream.Reality is a little skewed in any case.  In an early scene, Tom Cruise's car has an inspection sticker with a date of ""2/30/01."" Late in the movie, what is ""reality"" and what is ""the dream"" are explained.  Various red herrings are revealed and discarded - or are they? The last thing you hear is yet another female actress saying ""Open your eyes"" at the very end of the movie.  ""In reality,"" the Cruise character has been in cryonic suspension for 150 years...or has he?  Is he just still dreaming lucidly?",Vanilla Sky

205,MissCzarChasm,Best Film of the Year,9,16 December 2001,"After seeing Vanilla Sky on opening night i left the theatre with a feeling in my got that basically was telling i saw a movie that was different, compelling, thought-provoking, and wondefully crafted. I haven't had this feeling since American Beauty. I've seen some good films since then don't get me wrong but I need to tell you that a film strikes a core with you when you know that it's one step closer to taking cinema to the next level. American Beauty did that in my opinion and now Vanilla Sky is setting a new trend in this evolution of film.The plot is too difficult to describe because i'm afraid i may give too many things away. One must go into this film without knowing any of the plot-twist. Just know that i agree with someone else that posted a comment who said the film is broken up into 3 sections: Tom Cruise as the ultimate playboy with everything going for him, His downfall, and finally the reality vs. dreams aspect of the film. All these elements are very important to the film because they shape the picture once it reaches its conclusion. During these sections several different themes are araised. During the first section the concept of What is casual sex? is addressed. Cameron Diaz delivers one of the best lines in the film that sums up this concept: ""When you sleep with someone your body makes a promise even if don't"". During the second section we get the whole vanity issue. After his accident with Diaz he is horribly disfigured. One has determine if he choses not to show his face for awhile because he feels Sofia(Penelope Cruz) won't like him or if he's simply vain. The final section is by far the most interesting and that is what is reality? Is it one big dream? Is it one big nightmare? Questions like these are addressed during the duration of Vanilla Sky and i for one love a film that can make me think about its many themes.Critics who have bashed this film all said it was too confusing. Sorry to say it but they really need to ""Open Their Eyes"" and see the big picture. Maybe some of these critics aren't open-minded enough to reach into their psyche and try focus on the questions that this film is giving them.As a filmmaker i think this is Cameron Crowe's best film because it's his most ambitious. I agree with others that his other films like ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Almost Famous"" are good because there is a piece of himself that is detectable in the film. However with Vanilla Sky he is going beyond his limits as a filmmaker to craft a truly magnificent film and if you think about it all the characters in the film you can kinda identify with so there is most likely a piece of him in all of these characters.Vanilla Sky wouldn't work half as well without the capable actors that are present in this film. Tom Cruise is quite good here because he has to play 3 different ""characters"" throughout the film: the playboy, the recluse when he's disfigured in the accident, and a man struggling with determining what is real and what isn't. This could possibly be one of his best performances and probably his most ambitious work as an actor.Penelope Cruz is actually decent as Sofia(pointing out that i haven't seen the spanish language version of the film which she is also in). I've never really been a fan of hers. Her films don't really leave a lasting impression on me, with the exception of ""Blow"", which i found her to be annoying in actually. However here she's quite adorable with a bitting sense of humor. Her and Tom share an unforced chemistry and it makes it quite clear why they're now a pair in real life.Kurt Russell is good in the film as well. His scenes are all shared with Tom Cruise so it's very important that they share some kind of chemistry to make their scenes work and in the end they do. Jason Lee is quite funny as Tom's best friend in the film and he brings with him a charm that is present in all of his roles.FINALLY!!!!! we have Cameron Diaz who gives her bestformance to date in a small yet pivotal role in the film. She has to convey anger, sympathy, and all around weirdness all at one time during certain scenes and she just carries herself so well. The scene with her and Tom in the car is both intense and bizzare.(*SPOILER*) There is also two key moments where in the second half of the film, she has to mimic penelope cruz and she does an amazing job. I was quite impressed shows that she deserves that $20 million dollar paycheck she's getting for Charlie's Angels 2.I'm going to wrap up my review bt i swear i can't stop talking abut this film. It's just such a beautifully crafted film and i'm so glad that a film like this is out right now. The ads for this film are quite misleading and think people that see it will be pleasantly surprised or quite disappointed because they were expecting something a little more simple. This could be one of those misunderstood films like A.I. However, i sure hope this doesn't get lost in the shuffle.10/10*Note: There is a really interesting scene in the beginning where Tom Cruise is running through Time Square in New York that was quite interesting to watch. What a site to see no one walking through Time Square. Quite eerie.",Vanilla Sky
206,matteveland95,Brilliant acting.,10,18 October 2021,Besides the brilliant story within and the nonlinear layered telling of it- I truly believe this to be one of the finest portrayals of love to be put on screen.

207,claudemercure,interesting failure,6,16 August 2002,"It's nice to see Tom Cruise taking some risks lately, doing arty stuff like this movie and Eyes Wide Shut, and playing a drug addict in Minority Report.But risks don't always pay off.Vanilla Sky is a remake of the Spanish film Open Your Eyes, which I haven't seen. This is one of those movies where you're not sure if what's happening is real. I usually love this kind of movie (Jacob's Ladder is a good example of the genre), but Cameron Crowe messed this one up. It's hard to be affected (shocked, moved) by a movie that never goes beneath the surface of things. The characters aren't fleshed out, the relationships are never made believable, and the surprise ending has no weight - it may indeed be unexpected, but it is also rather uninteresting. The same concept was handled in a much less heavy-handed (and more entertaining and effective) way in Total Recall. I think the key problem is that this is a remake; I think Crowe could have done a great job if he had written his own original script. There are a few nicely surreal moments (such as the much-discussed Times Square sequence), but they are stranded in the middle of a failed experiment.The best thing about this movie is the director's great taste in music - the soundtrack features excellent, well-chosen tracks by Radiohead, R.E.M., Sinead O'Connor, and The Chemical Brothers, among others.",Vanilla Sky
208,TC-Batsy,Tom Cruise the Mysterious One,10,28 March 2005,"Vanilla Sky is a unique and great movie. It makes you think and wonder what has really happened to the protagonist (David Aames), and whether the entire movie is based on his dreams, or not? Tom Cruise was terrific when he portrayed David Aames, a wealthy playboy who doesn't know how to keep his promises, especially when it comes to having sex with Julia whom he doesn't love. During his birthday party, David meets the lovely Sophia who captures his heart despite being his best friend's new girlfriend. He soon finds himself drawn to her and in love at the same time. But everything ends tragically for David when Julie takes him for drive in her car and attempts to kill him as a punishment for his disloyalty towards her. She dies in the accident that leaves him with a disfigured face and in a coma for three weeks. In my humble opinion, I think that David's dilemma, as well as his love affair with Sophia both change him emotionally as he tries to overcome all the errors that he made in his lifetime. Finally, Vanilla Sky is a combination of science-fiction, thriller, mystery and romance for those who like to understand movies from a different point of view.",Vanilla Sky
209,zapdude,Extremely good movie,10,17 December 2001,"I saw the original ""Open Your Eyes"" in summer of 2000 (see my review of that). I remember when I heard that Tom Cruise was going to redo it, I was hoping he'd be able to make it at least as good.This movie exceeded my expectations. Why? Because it was basically a re-shoot in English of an uncommonly good film.The audience in the screening I just watched was unusually silent. Many people may have been wondering what was going on, trying to work through the plot twists. From the opening scene until very near the end, it's not entirely clear why things are happening, but the final scenes DO wrap it up. You get a very satisfying sense of ""I didn't see that coming, but I like it"".There is a percentage of people who will simply never get this movie. They will think it's stupid, pointless, long, and boring. Then there are the people who will recognize it for what it is: a brilliant concept, exceptionally scripted, well shot, and this time there's a soundtrack to enjoy.If you let yourself get immersed in the characters, you may even be surprised at the depth of emotion their fates will evoke.If your IQ is over 100 (the ""average""), then I predict you will enjoy this movie.

Vanilla sky is a mind-bending intellectual trip that leaves youbreathless. Cameron Crowe's take on this story is great- and hisdirection/vision is amazing. The cast is perfect. Cruise-contrary to those who obviously have apredisposed dislike of him- is GREAT in this film. Why don'tpeople like him? What has he done that people hate so much. Doyou dislike him because he's attractive? The boy can act! Get overit. Diaz puts in the best dramatic performance of her career,and Russell is great. (Love the ""I'm REAL"" bit at the end). The sound track is one of the best in years (typical of Crowe). And the plot is...well... right up there with ""Usual Suspects,""""Memento,"" ""The Game,"" ""Jacob's Ladder""... I fully intend to see the Spanish film this was based on, but I won'tdislike this film because the other might be better (or not.) TakeVanilla Sky for what it is and get over it. 8/10 stars.",Vanilla Sky
212,GEM-20,So - so,4,20 January 2002,"Many people seem to be in love with this movie. I am very hard-pressed to know why. I found it to be a confusing, overrated, over-acted mess of a film.When I saw the words, ""Intellectual"" in some ratings, I was prepared to be challenged in an interesting way. Unfortunately, I wasn't. I thought the movie needed some serious editing.Certainly, the opening sequence, in an unpopulated New York Times Square is fascinating to look at, but the movie never lives up to that for the remainder of the running time. (Which was easily 45 minutes too long.)Maybe they thought that things could be wrapped up in a surprise ending. (Don't worry, I won't expose it here.) I love surprise endings. But, once they get to that portion, Tom Cruise, Kurt Russell, and another actor simply sit and talk about it for minutes on end. I kept thinking, ""GET ON WITH IT, ANYWAY!!""I know that a movie is not working when I find myself looking at my watch and estimating how much is left. I should not have the experience of sitting in a theater and thinking, ""Well, let's see. I'll be out of here in an hour!""A superior film, with an unforgettable surprise ending, was ""Angel Heart"" from 1987 and starred Mickey Roarke and Robert DeNiro. Get that one and blow off ""Vanilla Sky"".My personal rating of ""Vanilla Sky"": *.5 out of ****.",Vanilla Sky
213,mgulev,Wow!,9,3 February 2002,"Ging in to the movie-theatre, I thought this would be another guy-sleeps-with-two-women-and-is-punished movie, but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!This movie takes several turns I was unprepared for and thus stunned me. Don´t read too many reviews or the ""surprises"" won´t have the same impact.Apart from this, it was well-acted (even by Cruise) and greatly cut!9/10",Vanilla Sky
214,rokcomx,Why the hostility? It's a good Dream Study ---,8,26 January 2011,"I've never understood the hostility toward this movie. For movies rooted in both lucid and unconscious dream therapy, it's FAR better than What Dreams May Come, the Matrix trilogy, Total Recall, Brainstorm, and the like.I'm particularly fond of how classic record album covers are subtly recreated in various shots throughout the film, some very subtle indeed, like Cruise and Cruz walking arm in arm in a shot straight off a Bob Dylan record.A second viewing is almost demanded, as the final twists continue to provoke thought long after the movie wraps up. In this, it's akin to flicks like Memento, Donnie Darko, Videodrome, and the Sixth Sense --- it gets under your skin and keeps you tossing around bits and pieces of it in your brain, ironically/appropriately just as you're trying to get to sleep that night -----",Vanilla Sky
215,brendonm,unexpected....,9,16 December 2001,"Not having seen the Spanish-language version of this may have helped me enjoy it more -- I've heard people who have seen the original say Crowe's film is a letdown.  But I really loved it:  is this a cautionary tale?  A story about the irony of having it all but not being able to (literally) save face?  A thriller? A revenge tale?  The story encompasses all of these things.  The sci-fi stuff at the end while not that original was nicely brought back in (PAY ATTENTION to Benny the Dog!  What I thought at first was just scene filler or fluff came back into the story in a big way!).  I guess watching this post 9-11-01 had something to do with my reaction to the ending.  How was Cameron Crowe to know what horrible events would happen while he was making this?SPOILERS?I have two small gripes:  Great soundtrack, and I like Peter Gabriel's music, but please, please turn it off so I can concentrate on the dialogue. Also, the expository scene where half the movie explained away is a bit annoying, but maybe Crowe felt it necessary for Ma and Pa Briggs in the Hinterlands so they could understand the movie.  Still, I'm willing to forgive Crowe these mistakes because the sum is so much greater than the individual parts.  One of the most uniquely satisfying films of 2001 along with David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DRIVE and Kubrick/Spielberg's A.I.Go see it.",Vanilla Sky
216,ShinKyo81,"""Vanilla Sky"" or Crowe's ""Abre los ojos"" own interpretation",9,3 October 2002,"First of all, I'd like to point out that ""Vanilla Sky"" should be not considered as a straight remake of ""Abre los ojos"", but a film that teach us how to tell the same story in a different way. The Amenábar version was darker and more creepy than Crowe's one in all elements: the story hadn't the fairytale atmosphere that ""Vanilla Sky"" has got, the characters were darker and more serious, the shots and lightning were more creepy and so on.That's where ""Vanilla Sky"" had the mistake. People were expecting the dark thriller that was ""Abre los ojos"", but instead of that, the audience recieves an ""americanized"" version, more colorful and beautiful indeed, adding to the story the fairy-tale style that Crowe's has given to the film.
Tom Cruise, Penélope Cruz, Jason Lee, Kurt Russel and Cameron Diaz, all of them have incredible performances, better than I expected (I'd probably not say out loud Diaz did a good performance).I only do this comments for that kind of movies that surprise me, or make worth my money spent. So, ""Vanilla Sky"" is worth the money and the surprise :) A must-see 9/10",Vanilla Sky
217,radmanart,Cameron Crowe Please More Like This,10,18 October 2019,"This is Cameron Crowe at his utmost. Why genius like this goes untapped; I will never know. This movie is worth watching just for the incredible filming of it. Not just because of CG. They really shut down time square; for intense. Called ""the million dollar shot."". Cameron Crowe said: ""We had Times Square to ourselves, which was an eerie, inspiring feeling,"" If you have ever lived in a city around or in New York City you know what this means.This has always been one of my favorite movies and still is. My wife wanted to watch it again and I jump at the chance. I wrote this about Vanilla Sky on my Radmanart blog in 2017:I was watching Vanilla Sky the other day and was moved again by this awesome movie. David to me resembles the scars of mistakes we make in life. This part gave me chills (edit): And what is any life; if not the pursuit of a dream The dream of peace the dream of achievement the dream of hearing someone say these words when they really, and truly mean them, I love you, Roam free Most of us live our whole lives without any real adventure; to call our own It's hard to comprehend; they laughed at Jules Verne too.David offended Julianna Gianni selfishly and awfully. Isn't that the true scar's of David? David's life completely changes because of his disfigurement. Is that right? No it is not. One minute popular David the next shunned, even by his, one time, friends. Many uniquely, amazing people in our society are affected in this same way; without any visible scars. One minute a pinnacle of society, the next condemned by our fanatical political and religious beliefs. Very sad.",Vanilla Sky
218,Extraordinary_Machine,"Like Alejandro Amenábar before him, Cameron Crowe can't really balance the romance/drama and mystery/thriller elements too well...",7,8 May 2005,"Vanilla SkyDavid Aames (Tom Cruise) is a young and wealthy womaniser, who has a slightly jealous best friend, Brian (Jason Lee). At David's birthday party, he meets Brian's date, Sofia (Penélope Cruz), and instantly warms to her, and they end up spending the night together, but only enjoying each other's company. When Julie (Cameron Diaz), one of David's latest conquests who has been developing an unhealthy obsession with him, crashes her car with him in the passenger's seat, it leaves David horribly disfigured. Feeling his life is essentially over, David becomes withdrawn and angry, but his relationship with Sofia helps him to see the world in a new light. He cheers up even more when he learns of the possibility that doctors may be able to reconstruct his facial features, but everything changes when a face from the past comes back to haunt him.It's great that Channel Four broadcast the 1997 Spanish original 'Open Your Eyes' the night before this Hollywood remake, 'Vanilla Sky' (which is also good, but suffers from the same problems), was broadcast. Problems, you say? Well, writer/director Cameron Crowe has made a very interesting, involving film, but like Alejandro Amenábar before him, he can't really balance the romance/drama and mystery/thriller elements too well. 'Sky' feels kind of uneven, even though the plot is fresh and surprising. However, the performances are good, and I can see why Cameron Crowe decided to rehire Penélope Cruz for the remake, as she really is a radiant presence. Just a note, though: this film is more of a romance, while 'Open Your Eyes' is more of a thriller, so I guess your preference depends on which genre you like more, I suppose. I don't have a favourite out of the two, so I think they are both good...just not great.~ 7/10 ~",Vanilla Sky
219,rak78,vanilla cake better,1,15 December 2002,"You really have to understand this movie. This way, you can figure out what is the difference between a sci-fi or just a bad screenplay where they just couldn't find a more real story after they probably spent a lot of cash on releasing it. It blows, it has no reason, no action, nothing... another waste of time!",Vanilla Sky
220,db3,My candidate for Worst Film of the Year,1,15 December 2001,"VANILLA SKY   (bomb)   / Drama   / Dir: Cameron Crowe / Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron DiazA business executive is nearly killed when his jilted lover commits suicide by driving off a bridge. High points are the love scenes between Tom Cruise & Penelope Cruz as well as Tom Cruise & Cameron Diaz. Trouble is, for 1/3 of the film Tom Cruise wears a mask, and for another 1/3 his face is horribly disfigured. The directing and acting are quite adequate, but not inspired. While VANILLA SKY is long and plodding, its real problem is not in the execution, but with the script. The premise is so far-fetched it's worthless. VANILLA SKY is made up of flash forwards, flashbacks and dream sequences. It resembles LSD trip films of the '60s. The mix is so confusing it's not possible to tell the real from the dreams. But maybe that's the idea. I had no idea where this film was heading until it arrived. When it did, I found the experience totally unsatisfying.VANILLA SKY easily ranks as the worst film I've seen this year.Dave",Vanilla Sky
221,AlienByChoice,And the Razzie goes to...,1,21 April 2002,"""Vanilla sky""! Ladies and Gentlemen, I am proud to announce that I have finally seen the worst movie of my life. I believe, that no other movie that I have seen or will ever see till the day I die, including the porno flicks from Internet, will be as bad as this one. It gets 1 out of 10 points, earned by Penelope Cruise by her smile. The rest should have been:the script - terrible, but with pretensions to be smart,the acting - not worth mentioning,the camera work - amateur,the dialogs - what dialogs?character development - oh, yes, Tom Cruise's hero evolves into... can't remember what, not much different than what he used to be, though.This movie reminded me of an article the ""Popular Science"" ran last month - it was about anti-matter. One of the ways to use anti-matter, is in comics, when the plot is getting too complicated and there is no way out, you set up an ""ANTI-MATTER EXPLOSION"", killing everyone, or sending everyone back in time. :-) Well, the end of this movie is rather similar to the ""ANTI-MATTER EXPLOSION"". I won't give it away for the sake of those poor souls who decide to rent this picture, but... Imagine, that you are the director. You have a stupid plot with no reasonable solution, bad acting, terrible camera work, etc., and you want to put an end to it all... What do you do? I'll tell you what YOU should do: STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!!!",Vanilla Sky
222,calm,Eyes Wide Shut?,5,14 December 2001,"I felt very much like I was watching ""Eyes Wide Shut"".  A never ending, meaningless and confusing mystery with no moral to the story.  Vanilla Sky showed its best sequence in the trailers, which I enjoyed enough to go see the movie with great expectations.  Some parts were somewhat entertaining but like ""Eyes Wide Shut"", it left you feeling like you should have skipped this one, it really is not worth the $9 bucks or 2+ hours of your time.",Vanilla Sky
223,Khwaj,"Confusing, mindbending did I miss something?",7,17 April 2002,"I no idea what I was leading myself into when I first took a glimpse of Vanilla Sky?I mean sure it was another Tom Cruise flick re-uniting with 'Jerry Maguire' favorite Cameron Crowe and throwing in the likes of Penelope Cruz, Jason Lee, Kurt Russel and the un-avoidable Cameron Diaz but there was something about this film I didn't quite catch.  . . .?To begin with I heard it was a remake of a Spanish film ""Open your Eyes"" and secondly the story was not was it was meant to be then I realized that maybe it wasn't such a good idea?The confusing aspect about the story was Tom Cruise's character' a successful millionaire who's claimed everything only one could ever dream of and then meeting the girl of his dreams (real-life love interest Penelope Cruz).The story then begins to take a somewhat ""abstract"" turning point when past girlfriend Cameron Diaz turns up taking our lead for a ride only to end up committing suicide by driving off a bridge. All in the name of love I might add.What you end up experiencing is a series flashbacks of present day events and wonderful vivid dream like sequences. Which sends a host of ""should I say"" unanswered questions.For me this film reminded more of a Dario Argento formula: Stylish camera work and set design not to mention awkward scenario.Although this is my first time seeing a virtual remake it's not surprising in the least how some of these big time directors dish out bucket loads of cash on sprucing up old cuts with style and vision. The one image that many will reflect upon is the Times Square scenario, in which Tom Crusie gets out his car and begins to run through an isolated environment (note: Cameron Crowe had closed off Times Square for an hour just capture this one beautiful scene).All in all not bad, but when watching this film it began to remind me of other mindbending films that had me on the rebound (Total Recall, Twelve Monkeys and Fight Club).With alot of style but little appreciation towards story, I'd probably have to say that this is a slight let down. The film too began to suffer from an identity crises. Whatever you may think I couldn't but feel robbed as your never left feeling satisfied as to whether he was dreaming or not?Stylish but not impressive. 7/10",Vanilla Sky

One of Crowe's enigmatic characters 'explains' the film near the finale, only Crowe messes it up with yet another curve ball.The taste of vanilla here? No, only raspberry.",Vanilla Sky

227,konover,Definitely worth watching,10,8 January 2002,"The movie is definitely worth watching. I'm not sure why the movie has gotten such a love it/hate it reputation, but I definitely loved it. Tom Cruise is a great actor. I wish he'd do more of these dramatic kind of roles because he can definitely act. Cameron Diaz gives a great performance and steals the show from Penelope Cruz who gives a solid performance, but wasn't as impressive as Diaz. Jason Lee plays Jason Lee, which is always fun, but like Steve Buscemi's trade-mark witticism from the 90s, Lee's schtick is getting just a little tiresome, in my opinion. Kurt Russell, who I'm a big fan of, has a good supporting role in the film.There was a lot of eye candy as far as the visuals. I loved the scene at the club. I think Cruise did some of his best acting in this sequence. Rex Reed said there was some unintentional laughter in the film, but who was to say it's unintentional? I laughed at several points in the film, but that only made me enjoy it more. What he calls unintentional, I call ""dark comedy"". I also enjoyed the diverse soundtrack.I would recommend seeing the film on a big screen, but one thing about the film for those waiting to see it on video or DVD. This is a movie you got to sit down and pay attention to. If you're one of those people that likes to get up and do the dishes or fix the room or talk during the movie, you're NOT going to follow it AND thus you're probably not going to like it.",Vanilla Sky
228,TexMetal4JC,Incredible!,10,3 January 2002,"The trick with movies like this (THIS: Vanilla Sky, Fight Club, The Sixth Sense to a lesser extent) is to watch it twice. After first watching Vanilla Sky, I came away impressed, both with the artistic merits of the film, and with the plot itself. But upon second viewing, knowing the ending ahead of time, I was blown away by all the subtle intricacies that are right under the audience's noses but seemingly unapparent.Enough people have debated it on here already. Suffice it to say that Tom Cruise proves himself yet again as a spectacular actor and Cameron Crowe creates a monumental movie, a masterpiece. This is not only one of the best movies of the year, but one of the best of all time. An intelligent romantic thriller not seen since the days of Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock...10/10",Vanilla Sky

I can see why people like this film however when I watched it, I just wasn't feeling what everyone else was. Maybe I completely missed something in the film...This film felt like a complete waste of time. I was confused the entire way through the film (although it seems this is what was intended) and the ending made sense... But the ending was poor, very very poor.

231,yoyomagoo,Surprisingly good,7,15 March 2003,"After reading some quite negative views for this movie, I was not sure whether I should fork out some money to rent it. However, it was a pleasant surprise. I haven't seen the original movie, but if its better than this, I'd be in heaven.Tom Cruise gives a strong performance as the seemingly unstable David, convincing me that he is more than a smile on legs (for only the third time in his career- the other examples were Magnolia and Born on the Fourth of July). Penelope Cruz is slightly lightweight but fills the demands for her role, as does Diaz. The only disappointment is the slightly bland Kurt Russell. In the movie, however, it is not the acting that really impresses- its the filmmaking.Cameron Crowe excels in the director's role, providing himself with a welcome change of pace from his usual schtick. The increasing insanity of the movie is perfectly executed by Crowe (the brief sequence where Cruise walks through an empty Time Square is incredibly effective). The soundtrack (a distinguishing feature of a Crowe movie) is also sublime.
You will be shocked and challenged as a viewer. The plot does seem a little contrived but the issues explored behind it are endlessly discussable. The movie isn't perfect, but its a welcome change of pace for Cruise and Crowe and for those raised on a diet of Hollywood gloss, should be a revelation.",Vanilla Sky
232,mjensen-3,A cross between A.I and Memento,9,14 December 2001,"A cross between A.I. and Memento. There is one word to say about Vanilla Sky ""SUPERB."" Surprisingly it's  the best role Tom Cruise's has ever done in his career and it's Cameron Crowe at his best. Cameron Crowe gives us a message that will melt your heart in so many ways but I'm not going to spoil it for you because the trailer doesn't tell you anything. The reason that I think it's a cross between A.I. and Memento is because New York seems very futuristic almost like A.I, and it has a very strange twist to it like Memento.Penelope Cruz's role is better than her role in ''Captain Corellis Madolin'' and Kurt Russell is surprisingly good in his role. Cameron Diaz should be known as one of the greatest dramatic actresses in the world. It's a roller coaster all the way and if Russell Crowe gets nominated for an Oscar, I think Tom Cruise will be great competition. Please see it.",Vanilla Sky

234,surfandski,A great cast deliver an excellent story in top form.,8,17 January 2004,"Vanilla Sky is an excellent adaptation of the Spanish film Abre los Ojos (open your eyes, which I have also seen). What Vanilla Sky has over the original is excellent performances from all its cast members. Along with Magnolia, this is probably Tom Cruise best performance, I am not a great fan of his commercial work, but you have to respect the man here. His facial expressions are a joy to watch in every shot, it is a great, underrated performance, like George Clooney's performance in Solaris. Cameron Diaz also shines as the 'villain'. I agree with a reviewer here which says that the music was distracting, even though the soundtrack is excellent, it is not appropriate, it seems as if Crowe is trying to make a video of every sequence. However do not let this minor issue stop you from seeing this movie. One of the great things about Vanilla Sky is that although the movie may seem confusing to some, everything is brought together at the end WITHOUT CHEATING. Many movies nowadays tend to get away from a straight narrative, nothing wrong with that, but with a script so full of holes that you could not put it together even with crazy glue, using the BS excuse that they will 'leave it up to the viewer to figure out what they really mean' or 'if you look carefully, it is all there'. Not here. In short, a great surprise from a movie I was not expecting much. 8/10",Vanilla Sky

See the orignal if you haven't already.",Vanilla Sky
236,Jamie-58,Improves with age,9,1 January 2004,"Many short sighted critics dismissed Vanilla Sky as the ultimate vanity project, a plea for acceptance by a middle aged superstar. That they underrated the film in the process is not necessarily their fault. Vanilla Sky gains immeasurably from repeat viewings, and what at first seems incoherent and muddled emerges as stylish and frequently very moving.In a way its a companion piece to David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, and all that is missing is a director of Lynch's bravado. Cameron Crowe tries hard, but his approach is just a shade too literal for the abstract goings on with this film. Reticence is also on show in the denoument which is too drawn out and overdone - every loose thread has to be sewn up, which is a pity.
But the good vastly outweighs the bad. The performances are outstanding. Cameron Diaz is a creepily effective villain/victim, and Penelope Cruz carries off the idealised and waifish Sofia with a rare skill. (I have read that the role was intended for Nicole Kidman, but she would have lacked the straight forward simplicity of Cruz.)And carrying the whole thing effortlessly as ever is Tom Cruise. What a star he is! He rarely rests on his laurels, and throughout there is a pronounced intellect at work in his performances. People who sneered at the film as a vehicle for Cruise to emote and vent his demons are missing the point. The film indeed has much to tell us, both pro and con, about celebrity and its attendant baggage - and frankly I can think of far worse ways of killing a few hours than watching Mr Cruise work his way through those issues. There are few people as qualified to do so.If its a vanity project, that's not to its detriment. Would that all vanity projects were as good as this one.",Vanilla Sky

I just wonder how long can Tom keep on make money by his face like this.  Though in the rest of the story, he did have his face deteriorated, however, his old looking was resumed.  Maybe the final part, when he commited suicide kinda solved the conflict in his mind. I still think, for Tom Cuise, only ""Born on the 4th of July"" is okay.  All the others, are worthless go-go movies.",Vanilla Sky
238,jimboduck,Glimpse of Insanity -- 8 (Very good),8,18 March 2005,"I was surprised by Last Samurai, hugely disappointed by Collateral, but was still in the video stores looking for more Tom Cruise. What's wrong with me? Have I turned into a fanatical Tom Cruise stalker in the past few months? Well, the last time I checked I have yet to start dotting my I's with hearts, so I should be in the clear. No, rather I think that since the days of Cocktail and Days of Thunder, Tom Cruise has chosen better and better work for himself with each project he commits to. Ever since Magnolia my respect for this internationally renowned mega-star has consistently increased movie by movie, although the overall quality of the movie sans Cruise still remains a crap-shoot. Take, for example, the OPEN YOUR EYES Americanized remake, VANILLA SKY.I started watching VANILLA SKY with my girlfriend, and about thirty minutes into the movie I started looking at my watch wishing it to be over. The Cruise, Cruz, Diaz, Lee love quadrangle starts of ordinary as hell, and I was mumbling to myself, oh great, another plastic family feud flick. Why didn't I just watch Friends instead, saving myself from this boredom.At the thirty minute mark, Cameron Diaz snaps like a flaky twig and drives Cruise and herself off a bridge. In sixty seconds the Friends-fest turns into a psychotic nightmare, and from there on out, VANILLA SKY runs its course as deranged as a Cronenberg film to the end in this grotesquely beautiful film.Anyone who's ever felt confined knows what it's like to hear things that aren't there, to believe in conspiracies, and to have waking life haunted by self-generated fiction. Cruise starts to lose his mind, no longer sure whether Cruz is Diaz or whether Cruise ever knew Cruz to begin with. VANILLA SKY portrays the insanity with simple and editing, paying homage to Bergman's Persona. My girlfriend and I took a cigarette break two-thirds into the movie, and she admitted that she was beginning to feel a little crazy herself. It's okay, don't worry. Sometimes these movies get to you.I've been trying to figure out why it isn't as popular as other Cruise movies, and I'm beginning to think that Cameron Crowe probably intended to fool the movie-going public around the world. Please imagine with me the following scenario. Nothing sexy is playing over the weekend, so you bring your family to VANILLA SKY since it has Cameron Diaz and since it might be like the Mask that your family loved so much. After going through psychotic hell and back, you storm out of the theaters saying, honestly, I don't know what's happening to America these days, but I'm going to write the mayor about this god forsaken vanilla trash. It's those crazy communist bastards in Hollywood destroying this country, you know. Our taxes used to go to decent, American Tom Cruise movies that make you feel good and sure of yourself. Now all you got is What, honey? Crazy? No, I'm not crazy, you're the one with the hippie parents! C'Mon kids, get into the freaking car! I'm cold.I can't comment on OPEN YOUR EYES since I haven't seen it.You know, the next Cruise movie should be a martial arts flick with Keanu Reeves Hong Kong style.

239,Alex-Tsander,Two stories stuck together like the wreckage of crashed cars.,4,23 April 2005,"I've seen both versions and they share the same peculiar flaw. The first two thirds set up a situation in one set of terms. The last third introduces a completely new set of terms as an ""explanation"". It seems in the Spanish version that the director set up a plot that he only belatedly realised the audience would be totally unable to understand. An essentially metaphysical scenario. Then he panicked and added on a completely different entity, essentially science-fiction, as an easy ""explanation"". Then the American version directly copied the entire package, importing the basic flaw.The work contains a great deal of promising material. For example, how Cameron Diaz manages in spite of her gorgeousness to depict a somehow loathsome character, which I at first thought to be only ""me"" before I realised that it was intentional. But the fundamental disjuncture between the two aspects of the film is gigantic, like a broken spine, that it essentially scuppers it. It's like one of those cars made by welding the front of one to the back of another and then re-sprayed as a single item. Under scrutiny, the join becomes obvious.",Vanilla Sky

Tom Cruise can't do it--not that he's incapable (I actually think he's rather underrated), but the character is a loser of a protagonist.  He's too self-satisfied early on and too self-pitying later to be even remotely likable.  I like Jason Lee a lot, so I'm sorry to say that his tacked-on buddy character doesn't cut the mustard either.Then we get to the ladies...OK, deep breath.  I really, truly mean it when I say that Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz are probably the two worst actresses in Hollywood that aren't working for Vivid Video.  On top of this, as luck would have it, they decided to reserve their worst respective performances for ""Vanilla Sky."" Both of them are positively grating.  ""When we come back as cats.""  I hope someone backs over you with their car. 
Crowe deserves as much blame as the cast--he fails to inject any sort of urgency into the film--though probably not through lack of trying.  For example, nice try switching the girls back and forth with alternate shots...too bad Spike Lee made much more compelling use of the same trick a decade earlier in ""Mo' Better Blues.""  This movie didn't need gimmickry and trickery--it needed someone to grab hold of the story and really tell it. Instead, it sort of wanders along, and the big plot twist comes long after all our interest is lost.A real bomb of a movie--avoid at all costs.",Vanilla Sky

It is about a man who is seriously disfigured in an automobile accident. And as his face heals, so does his mind, only not as fast; or maybe not at all. And just about the time you think you've figured it out for the third or fourth time, Director Cameron Crowe throws another log on and everybody is dead. No, they're not. Oh, who knows.

249,buzzerbill,Not quite there........,5,8 October 2008,"I am a big fan of Cameron Crowe. Liked ""Say Anything""; liked ""Jerry Maguire"" a lot; love ""Almost Famous"". I was really prepared to like ""Vanilla Sky"".And what's not too like? Good performances all around, unsurprising from Kurt Russell and Penelope Cruz, but a little surprising from Tom Cruise and amazing from Cameron Diaz. I thought her métier was only comedy. I was wrong.The film looks great.Good special effects and sound.So--what's the problem? Why only a 5? The first problem is that the film feels about 1/3 too long. After all, groping, even with pretty people like Cruise and Cruz and Diaz, is basically tedious. (I wonder when directors will learn that most sex scenes are in fact very boring. We've been (over)doing this since the 60s. Enough.) Nearly all scenes drag on too long. Of course, I believe that this might well be a strategy to give a dreamlike quality to the film. For this reviewer, it didn't work.The second problem is that the dialogue (usually a strength in Crowe's films) sometime just rings false. Take Julie's dialogue just before she rams her car into a bridge to try and kill herself and David. To me, this ranting about ""Your body makes a promise"" and ""You were inside me four times"" (I will not quote the last line, since this is a family site) sounds like a ludicrous cross between Oprah, ""Desperate Housewives"" on a bad day, and a particularly inept porn movie.The third, simply, is the structure of the plot. This is far from the first time we have seen this same plot; for instance, ""Jacob's Ladder"" (in my mind a very bad movie indeed) is nearly identical from a structural point of view. For a plot of this type to succeed, the writer needs to very carefully slip clues along the way so that the audience reaction to the final revelations is a mix of ""Cool!"" and ""Why didn't I see that coming?"" (Best example I know is ""Unbreakable"".) The fourth, I admit, may be idiosyncratic. Crowe's usual technique of weaving pop songs on the soundtrack just does not seem to jell with the material as well as it does in other films.Net this all together and you have a film that feels too long, sometimes sounds silly, have a soundtrack that is not always well matched to the action, and where the structure and resolution of the plot don't work well. Do not get me wrong--I think the final sequence from the elevator to the end is far and away the best thing in the film.A miss, a palpable miss.

There are some things that you don't expect are coming. However, it is the ending which kills this movie.

The original's title means open the eyes, but when you see this clumsy and wretched abomination, you'll want to close them again. Perhaps even gouge them out.The Spanish movie boasted a fine cast, skillful direction, and exquisite cinematography in relating a beautiful, romantic, inspiring, and thought provoking tale that touches both the heart and mind. This rubbish copy fails to do any of this. All you see is Tom Cruise sauntering around with a bizarre blemish on his face, while reciting lines in an uninspired mono tonal manner that fails to convey the rich story. A movie that poses questions about reality and fantasy, among several other topics, requires (and deserves) more convincing acting. Penelope Cruz did a fine job in the original, yet looks like a broken marionette in this version. Cameron Diaz, doing her same old over-aged teen girl bit, is simply annoying.A rare positive note here is Kurt Russell, not only for the one superior performance in this film, but for putting up with all these hacks and not just giving up as most people would be tempted to do. Also, I applaud whoever punched Tom in the face, marking him up like that: well done.

You know sometimes you see a film that is so bad that you become embarrassed to watch, because you know that your smarter, better self is dissapointed in what your doing? This is the kind of film.Tom Cruise, well, after seeing him reinvent himself and go for interesting roles (Eyes Wide Shut, Magnolia), he has now gone back to formula, playing shallow yuppie, spoiled upper class, Hollywood bird magnet brat (himself?) and obviously this is the intention, no fault of the 'Cruiser', its Cameron Crowes' (writer/ director) for having such a bland view on relationships and the even more irritating Penolope Cruz, whom you want to place faeces on her head and smack more than you'd like to make love to.The love affair between the two, the 'chemistry', is like a really, really disturbing horror film, that can take a while for the after effects to heal and natural, healthy sleep to reinhabit itself and overcome the trauma. It is so unremmitingly shallow (like episode of Freinds' without the canned laughter) and makes a shambles of superior (I'm talking 'God Like' proportions) remake Open Your Eyes that approached its themes with more depth and panache (don't they always).For 'cake and wine' fanatics and fans of the 'pyjama with popcorn party' only, and for them they are bound to say, 'wow, wasn't that deep? good but a bit weird at the end, don't you think? but what does it all mean? did he really do this?' e.t.c.

256,sugar_daddyo,Not Heavy Lifting,4,1 May 2007,"Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise have so much in common with David Aames that this movie is a first: a Bi-Biopic. Roger Ebert claimed the film requires heavy lifting from its audience which only confirms that his brain is fried. Faulkner this is not. Pop-friction it is.Only time will tell if any of Crowe's films will become timeless. However, his constant reliance on pop music to deliver the emotional climaxes in key scenes (q.v. the Beach Boys ""Good Vibrations"") firmly roots his movies in the Now. As a result, I am convinced the only timelessness this movie possesses is yet another Baby Boomer's narcissistic exploration of the possibility of immortality.Yet, are we really to believe that Aames, Crowe, or Cruise would actually pull the plug on themselves? According to Crowe, sure, if their lucid dream becomes anything less than a narcissistic fantasy.

A little slow, a little foggy at times, but overall, decent script, some good acting, and some thought provoking material.  I thought Kurt Russell's supporting performance was excellent.  Very different role for him.  He is particularly funny in the rooftop scene.  Tom Cruise plays two different people in this movie. Prior to the accident, he's a less humorous version of Jerry Maguire. After the accident, his character, along with the story, is more complex, darker. The makeup job for the ""scary"" version of him was well done.  Cruise does something in his acting that is hard to describe.  His performances are not great in the sense that you immerse yourself in his character and forget the actor (ala Edward Norton).  But at the same time, some of the nuances in his performance are so good that you still admire the overall performance. He's like a classic stage actor that exagerates a bit too much, but there is something interesting about the way he does it, so you still enjoy the performance.  Cameron Diaz doesn't add much to the film until the car ride, where she gets pretty scary.  Penelope Cruz, well, I'm not crazy about her acting, but she does a passable job.  Jason Lee is good as the best friend.You have to listen to this movie closely.

258,pc_dean,How the Other Half Half-Lives (possible spoilers),6,16 December 2001,"""Vanilla Sky"" is Cameron Crowe's remake of ""Abre los Ojos"", a surrealist Spanish movie, which, like so many surrealist Spanish movies, I didn't see.The remake takes place in New York, and, as required by federal law, opens with a helicopter shot of Manhattan that passes directly over the buildings until midtown resembles a grid of concrete layer cakes.  David Aames (Tom Cruise) is a cocky young magnate who runs a Maxim-oid magazine which he inherited from his father.  Surrounding him are Julie (Cameron Diaz), a singer with whom he engages in (for him) recreational sex; Brian (Jason Lee), his cool-geek novelist sidekick; and Sofia (Penelope Cruz), a mysterious ballerina that his buddy brings to a party.  Sparks fly between Cruz and Cruise, causing jealousy all around, leading to something I guess you would call a romantic parallellogram, ending in a car wreck that disfigures Cruise's face and cripples his cockiness.  He has to rebuild his life, while struggling against ""The Board"", seven sourpuss executives determined to steal his company.This is told in flashback: Cruise is in custody for murder, talking absently with a police psychologist (Kurt Russell), monitored by an ill-tempered guard who is itching for an excuse to throttle Cruise silly (maybe he saw ""Cocktail"").  The story shifts between reality and dreams frequently, which is alarming to Cruise.  He doesn't know when he's dreaming or not, what is real, and what happened or what he only thinks happened.  One minute he's sharing a cozy moment with Cruz, the next he's with Diaz (one wonders how, exactly, that constitutes a problem).  Is he going crazy?  Is he dreaming? After a while of this, I was in agreement with the dyspeptic guard: gimme five minutes in a room with the screenwriter and a rubber hose; I'll get this narrative-structure thing straightened out.We spend too long early on observing Cruise's party lifestyle, watching pretty people flirt blandly with one another.  The scenes are shallow, the dialogue cutesy, until the movie threatens to become yet another dull, talky, New York-set relationship comedy (I kept expecting Edward Burns to wander into a shot).  By the time it takes a serious turn with Cruise's disfigurement, we have little invested in the characters.  Cruise's plight seems less about profound crisis than vanity: his face is messed up, but it's not THAT bad.  He's still Tom Cruise, for Pete's sake.  He no longer has stunning women throwing themselves at him every three frames or so, but then, some of us have to live with that reality every day.The acting is effective and involving, if familiar.  Cruz played this role in the original; she's on friendly territory.  And she's not alone; ""Vanilla Sky"" sometimes feels like a weekend retreat for characters from other movies: Tom Cruise from ""Jerry Maguire"" meets Cameron Diaz from ""A Life Less Ordinary"" meets Jason Lee from ""Mallrats"" meets Kurt Russell from ""Unlawful Entry"".  While Cruise has played parts like this before, there's a reason: he's good at it.  His David, post-wreck, is not always sympathetic or readable (especially while behind a ""Halloween""-style therapeutic mask), but he's never uninteresting.  What credibility David's problems have stems entirely from Cruise's performance, and it's a lot to shoulder.  The characters do develop, it just takes most of them a long time to get around to it.I should come clean, too, that I am an inveterate Cameron Diaz junkie (proof: I made it through ""Keys to Tulsa"" AND ""Very Bad Things"".  My AMPAS Medal of Valor is pending.)  So I'll skip some hagiography and say she's good in a relatively small role.  Her confrontation with Cruise is deranged, disjointed, a little degrading, and heartbreaking.  Julie's nuts, but she's also a girl in love, who has been treated rather callously, and we find ourselves wanting to kick Cruise in the head (at least I did; but I get like that).  Diaz is also the first to invest her character with any kind of inner life, any signs of something under the surface.  Cruise doesn't manage that until the second reel, Cruz even later; Jason Lee never gets far beyond amiable goofiness.The movie is visually powerful, and that goes a long way.  Crowe infuses it with dreamy imagery and well-chosen music that smoothes over some of the clunky, predictable moments in the script.  The ending reveals a nifty premise well brought off (though you'll likely see it coming), and the last scenes have a weird Zen beauty to them, though they list a bit under the weight of some New Age silliness.  Unfortunately, even though we appreciate the well-crafted conclusion, there's still all the UPN-grade dramaturgy we had to slog through first.""Vanilla Sky"" aims for highbrow surrealism, but the movie it most called to mind was ""Total Recall"", which explored many of the same themes (granted, with more stuff blowing up).  However, its attempt with ""The Board"" to inject paranoia into the story doesn't take.  Good paranoia movies work because they weave a just-plausible layer of conspiracy into real life. Because ""Vanilla Sky"" is so unreal already, there's not much to be paranoid about.  How is ""The Board"" supposed to dictate the reality in Cruise's head? How is anybody?I don't exactly counsel against seeing ""Vanilla Sky"".  There is enough talent wrapped up in it to make it slightly more than the sum of its flawed parts.  And, hey, anything for Cameron Diaz.",Vanilla Sky

She had this sweet haunting eloquence that was not present in the latter.

265,karenlynn1,A horrible mess.,1,28 January 2006,"This movie was a mess, from beginning to end. It seemed very ""thrown together"" and almost as if it was entirely ad libbed. Tom Cruise plays David Aames; an egotistical, self-centered, rich pretty boy who thought he could do whatever he wanted and screw the consequences. In other words, he was playing himself. He finds out that treating women like yesterday's trash has consequences, when his ""bed buddy"" Julie(Cameron Diaz) starts to develop feelings for him and notices his attraction to another woman (Penelope Cruz). There is a bad car accident. Julie dies. David gets messed up physically, IE ""pretty boy"" isn't so pretty anymore, and he cannot handle it. THe vain playboy takes a dozen or so pills because he cannot stand his own face. He especially cannot handle that his dream girl (also his best friend's dream girl) wants very little to do with him. He became involved in this ""Lucid dream"" project (unsure whether it was before or after the accident, as the story jumps around so much time wise) and that is where the whole plot gets convoluted and twisted so that neither you nor the main character himself knows what is real and what isn't. In David's dream-life, he's still handsome. And he has a wonderful romance with Sophia...or wait, Julie? Oh wait, nobody. He's dead? he's alive? He's seeing a shrink ( Kurt Russell). His shrink doesn't exist...? It all becomes a blur of scenes of David's fantasies and pseudo-realities, and neither the audience nor David knows what is real and what is just a dream. It's not even *really* explained by the end of the movie. It would have been better if it were all wrapped up neatly in the end with an explanation of what is real and what isn't. But the end still kept us guessing. It also would have been better if Cruise had not been cast in the leading role. His over-acting and yelling every line reaches an all-time high. And his attempts at a drunken stagger were pantomimic and laughable. Penelope Cruz was bland at best. And, in my opinion Cameron Diaz' performance really stands out as the multi-faceted Julie.

The result is a horrific car accident which leaves him badly disfigured and experiencing events which he can't be sure are real or imaginary.  Kurt Russell plays a psychologist who tries to help David figure out whether what he remembers are dreams or reality and it is mainly through David's interviews with his psychologist that the audience is presented with flashbacks of events.Such is Cruise's superstar status that one feels he can take risks by accepting non-mainstream roles such as this -he spends a significant part of the film disfigured or wearing a latex mask.  No doubt, many people who go and see this movie will be disappointed by this fact but nevertheless, you still get to see that winsome trademark grin and Cruise manages to evoke sympathy through his character's confusion and torment.  Penelope Cruz is charming as Cruise's love interest and the chemistry between the two stars is evident on the screen.Events after the car crash are extremely confusing but stick with it and you will be enlightened by an explanation towards the end of the film which has a tinge of science fiction about it.  Although I was utterly confused, I was still intrigued and interested in the characters and what on earth was happening.  'Vanilla Sky' is certainly a thought provoking and memorable film but is also a film which I still can't decide whether I like or not. Thinking about it some more, I'm tending towards liking it.  After all, I am a Tom Cruise fan and he proves once again here, that he's not just a pretty face.",Vanilla Sky

Things you will like: 
Penelope Cruz is, as always, absolutely adorable, and maybe, just maybe, this will finally be that promised film that rockets her to legitimate Hollywood stardom.  But most likely not because the rotten word of mouth from the masses will keep everyone away.Tom Cruise does a fantastic job playing a role that fits him well.Cameron Diaz is funny, desirable, unnerving, and sympathetic all at the same time.The twists and things are well explained by the end, although the one major clue doesn't happen until about two hours in.  Still, the clues along the way should give you some idea of what's going on, maybe.  The final explanation at the end is quite satisfying.Kurt Russell is good, especially at the end.There's a part where you as an audience member are specifically referenced, although it does fall rather flat.It is at times gleefully surreal, switching from dreams to reality with little warning.Things you will not like:It is at times dreadfully surreal, switching from dreams to reality with little warning.Bloated.  It's over two hours long for no good reason, lots of dead time when you're sitting in your seat trying to will the thing to move like it's a drowned kitten.  You know, maybe that's a good analogy for the movie.  It had some real potential to be a kitten everyone would love, but poor little Cameron Crowe gave it a bath for too long trying to get it all pretty and it just kinda drowned and it's a shame, but that's the way it works.Jason Lee is not at the top of his game, although he does seem to have taken efforts to pluck some of the unibrow.No one who sees it with you will get it.It's not nearly as clever as it (and we, really) would like to think it was supposed to be.The complete shift in gears an hour an a half into the movie is so jarring that it feels like you're trying to teach a teenager how to drive a stick -- mental whiplash is not a pretty thing, although they try to explain it away later.It's just not worth more than two hours of your time.  If it had been shaved to an hour and a half, maybe, if it had put more substantive material into its actual length, maybe, but as it stands it is not worth your time or money from the perspective of entertainment or life education.

268,Lepidopterous_,A Drug You'll Take Again and Again,10,19 February 2013,"""Vanilla Sky"" is about a drug. It's a familiar drug that every man tries once in his life, whether consciously or not. In the film, that drug is Sofia (Penelope Cruz). She embodies love—that intoxicating drug that gives David (Tom Cruise) a high that permanently shifts his normal. In other words, his mood will never be the same again without it.David, a guy so perfect that a single gray hair is unacceptable, is seemingly forced towards humility after suffering a disfiguring accident shortly after meeting Sofia. However, it is not humility he achieves, but a curse that transcends any kind of physical deformity. David has to have that drug again, so he desperately seeks out his previous normal state, taking drastic measures to make it a reality.Both Cruise and Cruz play idealized characters. Cruise plays a meticulously perfect big shot, who is only likable because of his abundance of confidence and charm. Meanwhile, Cruz is the natural kind of perfect, and is as desirable as she is pure (she met his friend at a library!). It is no surprise that they were a pair in real life because their puppy love is authentic and palpable (an emotional stage on par with ""A Lot Like Love"" and ""Like Crazy""). I could not help but smile. And Cameron Diaz is utterly frightening as the irrationally clingy stalker—every man's worst nightmare.The film just exudes replay value. It is a cerebral ride along the lines of ""The Butterfly Effect"", ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", ""Source Code"", and ""The Fountain""—all loose-reality based films where a man obsesses over a woman.Vanilla Sky is pure ecstasy and an enthralling cinematic escape. It's a drug I want to take again and again.",Vanilla Sky

It starts out as a superficial movie about trendy, shallow people and segues into a nightmare where reality and fantasy mix with dreams until no one really knows what is happening inside or outside the movie.Completely different, but not unlike Memento. It is really dark and complex. Take Arnold in that science fiction movie with Sharon Stone - the one where he doesn't even know who he is, mix it with Spellbound and the other old Gregory Peck movie where he has amnesia and the General is after him, and you have a taste of Vanilla Sky.

I thought I was watching an intelligent, stylish thriller.  Then in the penultimate reel the film identified itself as science fiction.  Bummer.  I felt cheated, like I was the butt of a joke.  If I had known it was science fiction I would not have bothered with this movie.  I really resent being lured into the theatre with false advertising.  That said, it was, for the most part, well done. What I did NOT like about the movie itself (even accepting that it was the old bait-and-switch ploy) was Penelope Cruz.  Why, when we have so many beautiful and talented actresses in America, do we need to go scrounging around and digging up `actors' who cannot even speak English?  I really cannot stand to listen to her squeezing our language out through her nose. I do no find it in the least bit charming.  Ditch this dame.  Enough.  Marry her off to the Frito bandito where they can jabber to each other all they want and I don't have to listen to it. With that exception, I liked all the performances, even Kurt Russell, who switched on to Robin Williams mode for this movie.  Shame on the producers for advertising this movie falsely.

It's one of the most emotional films of the year, as well as a very romantic one.  It's a strange journey, for sure.  In fact, it never really makes any sense until the last twenty minutes, which is a remarkable treat. The pieces are all there, but you aren't let in until the climax.  Some may hate it... I loved it.  It's like a better version of Mulholland Drive (which decided to explain nothing and thus alienated 90% of the audience).

Though both actors do a superb job of flashing THE charming smile, we can get too much of a slick thing. Added to the mix, they are surrounded by lesser mortals with the same affliction of refined white flour dialogue, and cheesy grinitis.We are also left to wonder what exactly does the music have to do with what(little) is going on, on screen?I can see this guy Cameron Crowe doing smarmy TV in the near future.",Vanilla Sky

Vanilla Sky is a worthy remake, I was suprised at just how good Tom Cruise was in it, his fall from top business man into the depths of despair should surely get another nod from the Academy come Oscar nomination time.I don't think it is quite as good as Abre Los Ojos for two very different reasons.1). Penelope Cruz (or should that be Cruise?) is much more convincing actress when speaking in her native tongue.2) In the original, the Tom Cruise charactor (Noriega) is far more badly disfigured by the accident. I couldn't help thinking ""well come on, it's not that bad is it?""Apart from that well done Cameron Crowe, you didn't screw this classic up too much! Well done.",Vanilla Sky

This scene underlines a prevalenttheme in Golding's novel, namely that we live our lives believing inlies and when someone tries to enlighten us, we destroy themfirst;  worry about them eventually; and revere them finally.	Obviously, like all men I possess a vast compendium ofself-deception. I prefer having my biases reinforced, thank you verymuch, which is exactly what happened on the majority of initialreviews to Vanilla Sky. The majority of critics were underwhelmedand since I was passing through a particularly intense phase ofanti-Tom Cruiseism (based primarily on resentment, jealousy,and siding with Nicole), I was relieved at the lukewarm criticalreception. I dismissed the film. I figured someday I'd catch it onHBO for free. Maybe. 	A friend of mine kept telling me that I should see Vanilla Sky, that Iwould love it. I kept saying `mmmmkay' which means `Look,you're either a Tom Cruise-aholic or a Cameron Crowe freak andsince I'm neither (which means I'm smarter and more sophisticated than you) I'll see it someday but in the meantimeplease shut up and go away'	Finally last week, my friend went out and bought the DVD versionof Sky, came to my office, handed me the disc with a little note`enjoy and return ASAP'.

Not only did I love the moviebut my wife loved the flick as much as I which has happened ononly two other memorable occasions namely Glory and Titanic.	And she has more resentment for Cruise than I do as shedetested not only Eyes Wide Shut but also and both MissionImpossibles whereas I was merely disappointed by them.	Perhaps it's the fact that my wife and I `survived' a near-deathexperience in an automobile accident and to this day we have acertain amount of question as whether or not we are actually alive.Since I am typing this and you are reading it, does that mean weare both alive you and I or.....well, let's not go there.

279,Jisk,Candy coated A.I. wannabe,7,27 December 2001,"What an ugly mug that Tom Cruise sports in close up after close up in this supposedly intelligent ""thriller"". It is all hopeless to describe and pointless to write about. This is because it is about a character who is so despicable, we WANT him to die! You mean he survived again? GGRRRR! There has never been so much TOM CRUISE in one movie and he can not carry this thing because he is not likable- hardly at all in real life, even less so in this film. The ending is the only thing which really makes this film at all worth seeing but it plays like a long, LONG version of an episode of the Twilight Zone. There is also an element of Spielberg's 'A.I' in here as well as Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut'. In 'A.I.', the main character is also named David and it also ends with a gonzo whopper of a sci-fi finale. Unfortunately for this film, 'A.I.' also had two interesting acts previous to the last one, which this film does not have. Not to strain the Spielberg connection too much, but the guy makes a cameo in 'Vanilla Sky'(why?).All of that said, there are some creepy moments but unfortunately they add up to nil. Also, Cameron Crowe's trademark ""alternative"" sounding rock soundtrack finally spoils the party. Finally when things are getting interesting I hear Sinead O' Connor and I think, ""Oh, this is from that album that bombed"". I am taken out of the story just when it is getting good (at two hours +). Watch this one on late night cable when you are alone in your motel room at the ""Red Roof Inn"" and have nothing better to do. Actually, scratch that. At the ""Red Roof Inn"" you can play Nintendo for 8.50 an hour. THAT would be money well spent.",Vanilla Sky

281,forecastmazy,Another AMAZING Cameron Crowe Film,10,11 June 2003,"Cameron Crowe does it again in this amazing film. Vanilla Sky is what made Tom Cruise worthy of my respect. I mean being in a Cameron Crowe film is like being in a piece of rock history. The references of course to Radiohead and other amazing bands and the comparison to citizen Kane in a modern way could only be done in such a fashionable and interesting way by Cameron Crowe. I can't think of anything I would dislike about this movie. It confuses the slowest of people; If you wanted Top Gun you shouldn't see this movie. Tom Cruise is an amazing actor and the days of Top Gun 80s flicks are over. Tom Cruise gains the respect of the art community with this film.
Tom Cruise in this film plays a man who has everything. The man ultimately finds himself in some sort of conspiracy but his world is twisted and twilight zone like. When hes unable to trust even his own memory he questions his own reality...and the story just goes down the rabbit hole. It's hard not to like this movie unless your the type who likes to watch a film once and forget about it. You can't watch this movie and not think about it. The film has an ability to twist you and amaze you.
You could get lost and confused, I know alot of people did, but this movie is one you'll definitely want to own. Unless you like to watch American movies that just pet you on the head and star Martin Lawerence. This isn't an action movie, its a mainstream art movie. Unfortunately when you go to the mainstream with cinema-art you confuse half the dumb-witted who just DONT WANT THEIR LEVEL OF QUESTIONING raised. Jason Lee has an amazing performance in it, every character plays a key role and just leaves themselves in your psyche. Vanilla Sky is not a movie you can explain, you must experience it.

I thought maybe one day Cameron might read this. Or somebody who knew him would. So please, thank him for me, for creating something so pure that you can actually call it real. Thank you Cameron, from the bottom of my heart to the reaches of my soul, thank you. This movie means more to me than words can describe and I think you meant it this way.

Even when he gets the perfect dream life, his fears and guilty subconscious gets to him and disturbs his life. it really is all on his mind.   i love the last scene. it was very powerful. he finally knows what he wants. he know the consequences of his actions and is able to choose wisely. to finally face the unknown where it won't be easy anymore because he's 100 years into the future, but that's reality and finally he can face it again. a second chance to do it right.   this film was very real. the only problem might be that in some scenes it was kind of awkward and boring. but all in all one of the most real and powerful movies.",Vanilla Sky

A freak accident which results in the disfigurement of David's face changes the course of his entire life .

I'm not sure that it wouldn't have been a better film, had it not merely ended in the manner that it began rather than giving such a twisted (and almost hokey) explanation for the events that unfolded. I think the film had some spectacular moments but Crowe could have excised at least 30 minutes from it - it takes far too long to reach its conclusion. At least Cameron Crowe is trying to reach out beyond mere commercial formula, and though he is indeed a talented director had this been directed by Bunuel it would have been a masterpiece. Penelope Cruz is more than adequate as is the remaining cast. In spite of Tom Cruise ( alright - he's good but there are actors far superior to him) being in the film, I give it 8/10.",Vanilla Sky

Reviewers raved about the sterile AI but pretty much ignored this gem, which packs a deep emotional impact, especially to those who lived through the 60's (Crowe has woven in 60's-70's photos and music with the consummate skill of a Madison Ave wizard), but the simple and incredibly potent dilemma is this: If you have the ability to live in a seamless fantasy world of illusion... or the shattered reality of your broken dreams.... which would you choose? It embodies the literate moral quandary that all great sci-fi has, and truth be told- probably won't remain fiction for 70 years. At some point they will develop neural interfaces that allow people to be jacked into computers and experience artificial ""life""- at first it will be sex fantasies, of course. But eventually, simulations will get better and better till people can choose to live their very lives in the Matrix (to, ah, coin a phrase). If drug addiction is bad now, imagine how far people would drop out with such an option.VS is sometimes melodramatic and visually garish, but one must realize- that FITS- it is ALL a creation of Cruise's mind, and he is choosing cloud colors from Monet's paintings and theatrical drama, just as we do in our dreams. What is the reality of this movie? Is it all a coma-induced dream, or is he really living the Lucid Dreams of the cryogenic company he signed up with. Huge themes of immortality, eternal youth, true love, man's penchant for destruction and psychological sabotage jockey around for position- people that panned this movie are soulless nerds with no sense of curiosity about any of this. Life is a mystery and this ventures to ask some Big Questions.Another classic theme is someone who has it all (Cruise inherits an empire), loses it all, them gains it all back- so there's a lot of pathos there, letting Tommy play the gamut from smug radiant winner to broken loser- he can be a great actor when pushed (Born on the 4th of July) and he's far better here than most of his roles.Cameron Diaz is simply terrifying here- frankly her unhinged wild lustiness always gave me the creeps- this is exactly what I imagined her capable of- an obsessed deranged Fatal Atraction ex, and her reappearances are as shocking as the best horror flicks. Penelope Cruz is a little too Betty Boop cute and adorable here, though Tom liked her enough to do a corporate merger (they should have picked a 3rd spelling of their name- Crooz?), while Jason Lee plays the angry aggressive friend a little too broadly.If you've never seen it, DO. It is a preview of our future.",Vanilla Sky
287,Kuntos_the_Destroyer,Shut your eyes,4,1 February 2002,"***Possible spoilersI specifically say POSSIBLE spoilers because, although there are a lot of twists in Vanilla Sky to give away, there are few the movie doesn't give away itself. Particularly the final twist is telegraphed way too early and obviously by showing a completely out-of-place tv-clip about cryogenics (the frequent hinting at David Aames' fear of heights is a pretty good example too). And since so much of the final third of the movie is spent on twisting and turning this is pretty unforgivable. It gets even worse when you have a reasonable ammount of twist movie viewing experiences under your belt. Several twists seem to have been lifted right out of Total Recall, Dark City and/ or The Matrix. Vanilla Sky furthermore shows little understanding of how twists work, throwing in more than a few for their own sake (because we like twists, right??). In Fight Club or The Sixth Sense they add levels of depth, in Lost Highway they mostly seem to support an all-pervading feel of dread and unease, here they are there because we like the aforementioned films. Cameron Crowe is not David Lynch and he should have known it.As matter of fact, the twists began annoying me so much around 90 minutes into the film, they actually became unintendedly hilarious. What made it even funnier, for me, was the pretentiousness with which Cameron Crowe (a usually fine director, plus one of the two directors who got a decent performance out of Tom Cruise - in Jerry Maguire, the other is PT Anderson for Magnolia) presents it all. It has a fractured flashback structure, adds far too much weight to its ludricrous closing scenes (and many other ones, all scenes in which Aames wears his 'prosthetic' for example) and has the need to explicitate its themes from time to time. He also seems to be under the illusion that this is a surreal film. It, however, didn't convince me. The clunky exposition near the ending is too final for me. Crowe doesn't bring any duality into play. Had I walked out of it thinking maybe even the explanation about what happened to Aames was just a figment of his imagination (thus opening the movie to a host of new explanations again), I, being a twist fan too, would have liked it a lot better. Then there's his popculture fetishism, which, after the umpteenth misplaced song, kinda gets on your nerves (I WOULD have enjoyed some references to the movies this is stealing from, though). Also, there's surprisingly little humour (`Cryo-tainment.' is a gloriously bad example).In fact, looking at this 'cover version' of the Spanish film Abre les Oyos you get the impression the entire film is nothing but a miscalculated vanity project for Tom Cruise for, while he may spend half the running time either wearing a mask or scar tissue make-up, this film is all about him and his performance. He does get to show off a little more range than usual, but his character is no distinctly unlikable you never care for him. His David Aames start off as an extremely cocky, spoilt little brat oozing fake charm and, after the accident, turns into an equally detestable self-pitying man, who seems to care more about the fact that he's lost his looks than his life. Cruise can do the cocky, spoilt little brat oozing fake charm part, but falls dramatically short during his later scenes. His disfigured Aames seems to be modelled after Jack Nicholson's brilliant over-acting turn from The Shining and his man-in-the-mask scenes with Kurt Russell are so grotesquely played it's embarrassing.Yes, I know the film is basically a collection of pop-culture elements, but does that justify this film being this simple and empty? Yes, getting Times Square blocked off for shooting is impressive, too bad the scene isn't. So, are there any redeeming features? Well for me there were only a few: Cameron Diaz is very good and both Jason Lee and Russell are fine. And that's about it. Not that it's a technically inept film, but it never rises above the average in those respects. Another (fatal) point: the romance between Cruise and Cruz never generates any chemistry on-screen. Maybe it's the way Aames shamelessly steals Cruz' character from his best friend, or maybe it's because she falls for someone like him, either way there's something unlikable about their relationship. Thus, the movie fails to engage either as a head-scratching or a romantic thriller.The whole idea of interweaving reality and dreams is (still) a very interesting one, but it's been done both before and better. Vanilla Sky is a movie that is pretentious but looks down upon its audience at the same time.Rating: 4/10",Vanilla Sky
288,xawn,Each to his own interpretation,8,31 January 2002,"Its impossible to comment if this is a good movie or not, because it falls under the category of experimentation and phycology.

On the other hand this film is an experiment in interpretation. I must say i enjoyed the experience but not all the other people who saw it with me were impressed.I must however say that, although intelligent, the ending just was not in syncrony with the rest of the film - just like the A.I. ending it might have been omitted or diffused somehow!",Vanilla Sky
289,j_crist,boring,1,31 January 2002,"To begin with, to promote a movie for the fact to have shot a scene in an empty times square to me doesn't sound the only content that a movie should contain. You can do that also with CG or other special effect so that didn't impress me much. The whole movie was a stealing from dozens of films. Things I have seem before. IT could be summarize as a movie of a 30 years old crises as well. or the love-film of cruise-cruz. Sorry, that also doeasn't really attract me much to go to see the movie. I went to see the film because I was tricked: the trailer promised a thriller of some kind. The movie was very slow, incredible slow. It could have as well been an episode of the Twilight Hour or something. The plot was simple and didn't really need so much time to display. 30 minutes would have been enough. Cameron Crowe once again revealed that he is not really a skilled director. He just takes here and there, also the mixed filming technique is pretty annoying - you cannot tell what his style his. Beside the movie is made by cinematographer, director of photography, cameramen, set designer. The director is around to coordinate all this, you don't need much to be a director today. SOme new director know a lot of this stuff but sometime it looks like that director means just a name the production company wants to market as much as they can to sell the next movie and the next and the next and so on. Cruz acting, although she wasn't that bad in this film makes me wonder of how does she get in all these movies. I suppose she has a kickass agent because I don't think she is such a good actress as they portrait her in mags (see Blow with JOhnny Depp for instance). About the story of the movie, I haven't seen the original film (and that's another thing that annoys me, it was a movie made in 1997, is that necessary allready to make a remake? Don't hollywood writers have ideas on their own?), but everything was predictable from one scene to another and even often the dialogues were predictable, and I believe that's a very bad thing for a movie which is considered ""brilliant"", ""imaginative"", and so on... If you read the reviews anyway of the film in a few months, finally you will be able to read the real ones where writers will express their opinion finally because right now they are all just promoting the movies... it's marketing and business and I felt in it. Music. All those songs coming here and there... edited just like a music video... I felt like I was watching a promotional film for a CD Compilation sometime. As much as people would say, the songs are connected to the story... well, that's actually cheap... not a big deal if you ask me. It is easy to solve things that way. But on the other hand we all know how it work in the business. Even a non-sense tune recorded as a joke by a band against everything and most of all against ""business"" like the Radiohead tune in the opening scene can be negotiatable. I think that say it all... I worked for one of their videos once. And they were saying at that time - we are not going to do anymore videos!  Yeah right. At leats a different attitude would be more coherent... but that's another story. To end, ""Vanilla Sky""? What's the big deal with the painting and the story really? There wasn't much there either. My advice is to actually avoid this film. It is about time that some directors and production company get turned down. Don't give them your money! Beside, does someone remember ""Almost Famous""? Well, also there the reviews said ""Great"", ""Fantastic"", ""Amazing"" and if you read reviews now the rating has gone much down. Power of media and marketing I suppose. It's not fair, I still believe movies must have a story to tell. Just a few scenes filmed in a spectacular way should be all a movie contains.",Vanilla Sky
290,iainwatson,'big cinema' at it's best,8,30 January 2002,"I had heard mixed reviews of this film... ""load of rubbish"", ""boring"", ""brilliant"", ""bad ending"", ""really good ending"", etc. So with a bit of coaxing I went along to see it last night.I don't want to give too much away, but if you've seen the trailer, it tells you nothing about the true story behind the film... I expected the worst from this film, and I was pleasantly surprised when it came up trumps by not only being an intelligent and thought-provoking story, but also being extremeley well executed and 'big cinema' at it's best.The story itself can be a little confusing at times with the amount of time jumping being done, and things being changed all the time, and I thought ""oh here we go, it's gonna turn out that he's in a coma and has been dreaming the entire film"", but it turns out nothing along those lines. The main hook which really pulled me in was the idea how taking people in your life for granted and not thinking about the consequences of your actions can totally alter your life... and it's one of those things that stick with you after you see the film and get's you thinking - always a good thing in my book.Cruise was extremely believable as the silver-spoon kid who's life disintegrates round him, Cruz a little less so - a bit wooden I thought, but the winning performance for me was put in by Diaz who proves her acting talents far outshine her modelling prowess with every film (okay, mibbe not Charlie's Angels)... she is actually bloody scary in this film... majorly neurtotic, kinda like in 'Very Bad Things' - nuts.The only bad things I have to say about the film is that it perhaps drags on at certain points and doesn't keep the tension of the movie as tight as it should be, and there's a few really twee scenes that could have been left on the cutting room floor.",Vanilla Sky

The general feeling that the film was attempting to accomplish (becoming enveloped by nightmare or insanity) was presented with elements from such flimsy, shallow movies as Blowup (1966) and The Silence of the Lambs (1991). The director should have taken his cues from such peers as Terry Gilliam, Federico Fellini, and Milos Forman. Even if the odious directing and the wooden acting didn't offend me the dialogue would still be effusive drivel whose only noticeable purpose is to prolong the length of the piece.

292,Aman_Goyal,CAMERON CAMERON! CRUISE CRUZ!,10,24 May 2021,"""A masterpiece of a film, Vanilla Sky , just like it's infinite interpretations, also has infinite ways to be reviewed. People hate it, love it, ignore it, understand it, doesn't understand, enjoy or get frustrated. That's just like Cruise's character David Aames, who has no idea who's after him and with what intentions.""
Moving on from other people, I just loved it and the only thing that wasn't right with it is that it's a remake; and the haters would forever use this fact against it. This film sticks with you. It's far away from being boring. It teaches you so much, but you might not see that through. And that's okay too.Another weird thing is, the best of critics like Ebert and Richard put it in their 'Top 10 Films of 2001' lists; yet, it's critical score is just average. I guess this automatically makes others as worst critics.Structurally, it's not so different from PSYCHO. Girl meets guy. Guy has a haunting relationship with another woman, who creates trouble between them. And in the end, a psychiatrist explaining what was going on. BUT, it has a way too complex character transformation. Dozens of internal conflicts. And internal conflicts are never bad for a screenplay.Music was superb, Cruise's performance was just PERFECT. None could have pulled it off the way he did. Not even the actor in original Spanish version. Time's Square scene should alone make it the cult classic, which it kind of is.Overall, please please watch it. That's one thing you won't ever regret. Everyone needs different perspectives and this film would show you just that.(watched 11/17/2017)",Vanilla Sky
293,bosochima,It Was...OK,5,31 May 2002,"This was not the worst film I have ever seen, although I would not recommend it to just anyone. At first I was distracted by the camera tricks the director used to make Cameron Diaz (who is at least 5'8"" tall) look similar in height to Tom Cruise, but once the story got going it didn't seem so prominent. Overall all of the actors did a good job with their roles. Penelope Cruz was not nearly as distracting as she is in other films I've seen her in. The writing wasn't great, but it wasn't the worst I've ever heard either. The most impressive part of the film was the cinematography - the visuals were colorful and very pretty.As far as the plot, other posters have commented that if you ""get"" the film you will really appreciate it. I ""got"" this film, but I am not satisfied with the story. I feel that the territory this film explores has been covered with greater success by any number of ""Twilight Zone"" episodes. For most of the film I was confused (and not in a good, David Lynch way) but once I understood what was going on the whole thing seemed pretty flat, all of the supposed twists and turns easily explained away. I gave this film 5 out of 10.",Vanilla Sky
294,glocksout,Nerely great,7,14 August 2006,"The first and most obvious thing about this film is how perfectly everyone was cast, their on screen characters reflected the actors' real personalities. Tom Cruise plays an eccentric guy who is so full of himself that even those closest to him don't really matter. He's a very wealthy publisher with everything: youth, looks, cars, women, et al. His best friend is played by Jason Lee, a sarcastic and forgiving guy always ready to party. He also works for Cruise as a writer. Cameron Diaz plays another friend of Cruise who also happens to be his booty call. She's a skanky, obsessive beauty with not much going on in her head except for dreams of being with Tom forever. The story begins with Tom Cruise in a jail talking to a psychologist, portrayed by Kurt Russell, about the murder that took place. Kurt is a warm, but firm man who could care, or could care less (if that makes any sense). Cruise begins his story at his birthday party where Jason brings a random girl he just met, who happens to be played by Penélope Cruz. She is a quiet, cute and exotic woman who captivates the attention of Tom, much to the chagrin of Cameron. Tom ends up spending a sleepless night with Cruz drawing caricatures of each other, and talking about random stuff, and invariably fall in love. When he leaves the next morning, he is in a massive automobile accident that crushes his arm and face. I've left out a little there because I don't want to spoil the plot. Cruise wakes from a coma weeks later with a disfigured face, and the surgeons really can't do much about his looks, and he has terrible headaches. He falls into a depression, and is struck with the feeling that he's unwanted by his friends, his company, and even Penélope. Tom finally learns they can repair his face, and things turn his way again. Cruz is finally his, and they live happily until things start happening that Tom's mind cannot reconcile.The movie is directed by the incredulous Cameron Crowe with the beauty and grace you would expect from him. Vanilla Sky easily slides in and out of beautiful scenes you'd expect from Monet if he did film, and harsh scenes of emotional intensity. The story is well written as well, and very much like Mark Twain's The Mysterious Stranger. There are better movies of this type, but this one does have its own feel to it (thanks to Crowe) that sets it apart as something special. It really is a great film about love, loss, and friendship.",Vanilla Sky
295,slimebitch,As brilliant as I recalled it!,10,12 August 2016,"I think the first time I saw this movie, I didn't totally understand it and as I grew older, I grew wiser :) This is the third or forth time I have seen Vanilla Sky and if you follow the story about David and the small messages you should be able to make a point out of it or at least understand the message it sent me. What is happiness to you? This is different for different people and in the end I think real happiness is to understand that you need to be happy in real life and you can't keep living in a dream world. At least this is happiness to me. Everything in life is a choice and now and then this is what life is all about, making choices that leads to other things, greater things in life, or less happy things in life. All though I'd like to think that the end was happy to David and he got the happiness that he deserved. Is happiness really to be good looking or rich or is there a higher purpose to happiness. I think there is and I think he did realize this eventually :) Vanilla Sky is a great movie and should be watched not only once, but twice or three times or more to be honest.

Its not great but its certainly good. As a Lynch/SF fan I appreciated those elements but its certainly no Mulholland Drive (another reviewer here thinks Vanilla Sky is better which did make me smirk quite a lot!).It gets 7/10 for me because although its very good in places, its rather drawn out in others. The music didn't help either - I pretty much hated or didn't like or the music used in this film. I can honestly say that if this had had a good soundtrack (like Mulholland Drive for instance ;) ) I would have liked it more.To conclude - its a bit long and the soundtrack is pretty horrible (unless you like this kind of bland middle of the road rubbish). BUT if you are a Lynch/SF/mystery fan give it a go. I can see this one appealing to women as much as men but its not a straightforward date film - you will have to think a bit (and it might get you thinking too!)",Vanilla Sky
297,wondernat,It doesn't work,2,19 July 2006,"First of all, watch ""Abre los Ojos."" Then you'll understand why I hate it.Cameron Crowe showed his utmost lack of creativity with this one. Even some SHOTS are exactly alike (i.e., club scene). I was completely upset that Crowe can get a perfectly good Spanish movie, Americanize it, and be treated as a film hero. Crowe has nothing on Amenabar, and shame on Cruise for thinking he could top Noriega's performance by being a schmuck.Also, Cruise's ""schmucky"" performance made the continuity of this film completely bizarre. There were some very strong scenes that called for a very different performance/script. Whether it's the screenwriter's fault for not adjusting the mood of the scene or Tom Cruise for being such a schmuck, it just simply doesn't work.As a standalone movie, I'd give it a 6. However, because I've seen ""Abre los Ojos,"" I'm giving the low marks that I post here. Practice some Spanish and watch ""Abre.""

298,forehead1,Disappointingly disappointing,6,5 February 2002,"When I first heard about this film I couldn't wait to see it.  'Another quirky film with a Fight Club twist' I was told;  'If you liked Twelve Monkeys and Memento [loved 'em] you'll enjoy this.'  Not necessarily true.While watchable, I was left with an empty feeling when exiting the cinema. I was hoping for so much more, but all I got was a below-average movie with a good ending.  An interesting idea, I feel Cruise snapped up the rights to 'Open Your Eyes' without thinking about how the film would come across in the mainstream.  Crowe tried his best, but I don't think enough was added to make the improvements the film needed.  While enjoying the last third (to a point - anyone who states it isn't taking huge liberties regarding Total Recall is kidding themselves) I was only just managing to keep my attention after the fairly drab bulk of the film.  Yes character building was a necessity in this story, but the love story alone was not enough for me to warrant 90 minutes + of my viewing.  A new angle or sub-plot needed to be implemented.Sadly I wasn't even kept thinking throughout.  I knew very little about the film beforehand but I could predict it like a particularly badly written episode of Neighbours from fairly early on in the picture.  Once again: disappointing.  6/10",Vanilla Sky

Truth is Tom Cruise is an amazing actor and Penelope Cruz is an amazing actor as well, but this movie still manages to fall under the radar. With a title like Vanilla Sky, you forget it's actually a love story. More so, it's a movie that is built around decisions and the consequences of good and bad decisions. It's not a movie you watch while multitasking, but more so a movie you give your full attention and figure out as you go along.A great display of love, affection, decision and reality... well kinda reality...",Vanilla Sky

First at 150 odd minutes it wears on the most devoted fans. The ""formula"" films that are the ""rage"" of Hollywood run the usual 95 to 110 minutes and they hit the  demographic marks for all the well known reasons. Vanilla Sky does none of this and I want so much to applaud that notion ""but"" in this case it really confuses at first. If the Cruise and Cruz dynamics is not real I can buy the popcorn next time.  She is beautiful and he is .....well even disfigured he looks like a winner.Perhaps there might have been ways to visit ""Abra Los Ojos"" with less license.  If other folk's work is to be emulated, it seems that a holistic view would have been better instead of stealing the star and copping out the ending. Oh well, if there is to be real change in Hollywood toward works that take chances and ask the viewer to engage their mind as well as their emotions, then efforts like Vanilla Sky need to be supported.  So I say go see it. Don't let anyone ""spoil"" it for you before you do, and just let it flow for awhile and it will sort of grow on you. No awards are in order for cast nor others but it is still a brave effort.",Vanilla Sky
302,M&J,Be Prepared to Think.,8,14 July 2002,"I like this film because it makes you think. It is in no way a standard feel good film or action flick in the traditional sense. The trailers for the film are rather misleading because none of them mention anything besides the fact that Cruz, Cruise, and Diaz are in it.A lot of critics hated this film because of the plot. Perhaps that's why the studios didn't advertise it. However, judging from the reviews of other people on this site, this film has found an appreciative audience.Vanilla Sky challenges the viewer to figure out what is real and what is not. Its plot is a close cousin of films like Jacobs Ladder, The Others, Mullholand Drive, Fight Club, Lost Highway, The Matrix, The Sixth Sense. All of these films play off the concept of alternate realities. If you like films that make you wonder if you're living a dream, then check out this film.My only personal qualm with the film is that, if you take it literally, you have no reason to fear death and therefore can do horrible things to others, and to yourself, and somehow be a better person because of it. That is... IF you have enough money. I don't think this something the director or writer was purposefully trying to portray, but that's what I got out of the film, among other, less selfish things. All this means that the director didn't have a concise vision for the film. Vanilla sky is a spooky, eerie, thought provoking film. But because of a jumbled vision, the film will not be a classic. It COULD have been better but it's not bad at all. I give it 80% out of 100%. Better than average but not A material.",Vanilla Sky

And the truth is, some rewriting - maybe even a lot - or at least a slightly more adventurous adaptation might have served the movie well. True, the whole crippled act by Tom Cruise is quite surprisingly convincing and probably better than in the original, but it doesn't make up for the (unchanged) ridiculous ending - not as convoluted as it's cracked up to be, it just looks like a cheap trick from a scriptwriter who couldn't decide how to tie up the story's loose ends. (By the way, the love story, supposedly central here, is not well served by a total lack of ""onscreen chemistry"" between the Cruizes.) 	So if you want to see a really witty script toss around ""LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriendshipSex"", you're better off with David Fincher's The Game which, when you think about it, has a lot in common with this movie - except that it opposes, to a relatively bland story with a far-fetched, sci-fi-like ending, a mind-blowing story with a remarkably sober ending.

Tom Cruise is drool worthy and his performance is outstanding in this movie. David and Sophia's chemistry definitely manage keep the temperatures soaring.
With its nonlinear narration this movie suddenly changes its genre from romance to a psychological thriller which keeps resonating. It really messes up with your brains and its left open to the audience for interpretations. It is so thought provoking that it kept me obsessed over it for quite a few hours and I looked up for its different interpretations and advice you to do the same after u watch it.

308,unigolyn,Philip K. Dick meets The Game,10,10 January 2002,"First of all, to people who say the original was better, and ask why the movie was made: Excuse me, but it is near impossible to enjoy a movie to its full extent if you are reading subtitles. It distracts and it detracts, both from the narrative and, most of all, the performances. This movie was made because most people in the world who would see such movies speak english (not a native speaker myself, but everyone with half a brain learns english nowadays). Kurosawa's films are great, but every time I watch them I wish I could understand Japanese. Enter the remake. And by god, for once a remake is good (painful memories of that horrible botching of Besson's La Femme Nikita). I haven't seen the original, but suffice it to say that I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. Negative comments about Tom Cruise's acting cannot be anything other than some sort of personal hangup with the actor, who does exemplary work in Vanilla Sky. Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz both shine, especially Cruz, the scene at the wake was pure perfection. Jason Lee fit his character, and his acting was solid (although I think I'm forever cursed to think of him as Brodie, but that's my problem).  The direction was superb, most people would have copied David Fincher here, but Crowe has his own vision, and shows us a movie which keeps lulling into a french romantic drama, then bolting into a sort of David Lynch on speed. Those who claim the ending is not believable... watch documentaries or something. Out of all the wild ideas the film industry, or more precisely, the FICTION industry has produced, this is by far one of the more believable. It had that nice Philip K. Dick sort of feel to it, something which many sci-fi movies aspire to, but few succeed. Perhaps it IS a sort of version of We Can Remember It For You Wholesale, based more firmly in reality, with less shooting than Total Recall. Nonetheless, if you find this movie to be boring, perhaps you should be paying more attention. The Fugitive this is not. But is it good? By god yes.",Vanilla Sky

I was really deeply affected by it, and the rest of my day was totally different from normal. I had seen such a thing about evaluation of life I have never seen before.The story is really quirky, keeps your mind moving from the first minute to the last one. Apparently, it is found by some of the people, who have seen this film, freak as they had been expecting something utterly different. Personally, I got the point and I am really happy with it. There are some quotes I am really keen on, like ""The sweet is never really sweet without a sour."", or ""Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around"". Besides, I love the sound editing which conveyed supremely the melancholic atmosphere and ambivalent ardour of Vanilla Sky.After all, without a fine directing (which is not flawless though!) and a superb acting it all would not have been so fantastic. Tom Cruise proved he is not lost, he did a great job just like in Jerry Maguire which is directed by Cameron Crowe as well as Vanilla Sky. Cameron Diaz has never been a favourite actress of mine, sometimes I find her especially annoying but the role as a stalker fits her very well. Penelope Cruz gave an agreeable performance as well, she developed a great character who I could fall in love with too.Anyway, it is a controversial film from many aspects, you will love it or hate it.My rate is 10 out of 10.",Vanilla Sky

Mid way, after the accident after he emerges, Cruz stays with his friend, he cant get over it, he'd rather die, and he decides to go into cryogenic dream sleep, but the computer system controlling his cryogenic dreams f**ks up, and the second half of the movie is a convoluted nightmare. What the hell is so confusing when you are done seeing the movie?  Who are these people confused? Stoners? Simpletons?  I then listened to the DVD commentary.  Crowe says it plays straight.  the second half was a dream, he wakes up in the end 150 years in the future.  It is another actress's voice that tells him to open his eyes.  Some random nurse awakening him.Yes offense meant.  This is not at all in league of Usual Suspects, or anything. I am not trashing it, but it has no meaning.  Its just a story that doesnt explain itself until the end. It doesn't discuss the merits / drawbacks of lucid dreaming vs living in reality.  That would be a 'deep movie'.  Think Blade Runner - what happens to someone who falls in love with something he is supposed to kill on site, what happens to someone when they realize they are not what they thought they were, etc etc.

It felt like it would leave me with a sense of awe at the solution to the puzzle.  And, BOY, it did not disappoint.  Although for me it tied together well, it is one of those films that allows the viewer the luxury of watching it again and seeing many more layers and possible solutions to the puzzle laid before you.  The acting was great, with the possible exception of Penelope Cruz in a few scenes. (I felt she played a little too much on her foreign intrigue rather than true acting skill in a couple of spots [Just a very few spots]).  One of the players that I feel may have gotten overlooked was Cameron Diaz. She was TOTALLY believable, even when she seemed to flip from playful to deadly serious in the blink of an eye--and she did evil very well.  Tom Cruise is one of the most overlooked actors in Hollywood, in my opinion.  He is always solid and is much more than a pretty face.  Unfortunately, he is usually surrounded by bundles of talent (Jerry Maguire, Rainman) and oftens get overlooked.  This is probably his best delivery in his career as of yet. And Jason Lee holds his own.  He is not over-powered by the ""beautiful"" people he is surrounded by.Cameron Crowe is a masterful storyteller, and I am glad he does not just go for the easy quick Hollywood fix.  Too many movies today are just predictable--entertaining the first time you watch, but nothing to go back for later.  Vanilla Sky definitely makes you want to go back for seconds.",Vanilla Sky

315,Walls Of Jericho,Heavy drugs needed for enjoyment or recovery from this film,3,23 January 2002,"When I go to a party, there are two types of annoying guests. The intellectual eggheads who drone on endlessly, and the babbling motormouth airheads who must keep their lips flapping or they will apparently die of asphyxiation. ""Vanilla Sky"" is like the combination of those two guests. It drones on and on endlessly, and if you actually care to figure out what's going on, it will never let you get a thought in edgewise. Tom Cruise smirks a lot for forty minutes, then gets all confused, just like the audience. Cameron Diaz is hot and she can stalk me any day, but unfortunatly she's gone before we have a chance to know more about her. I don't know what the hell Penolope Cruz was trying to say, but they should have provided subtitles. The movie then turns into a pretentious hodgepodge of philosophy and virtual reality that by this point had me shaking my head. Of course, just like every other ""deep"" movie ever released since ""The Sixth Sense"", it has to have some quirky explanation as to why things were the way they were. Trust me, you'll be so underwhelmed by the secret suprise ending of ""Vanilla Sky"", you won't remember to reveal it anyone.

Consequently, it had plenty at stake and the final third of the film became one of the most frustrating, disappointing and underwhelming finales in memory.  Two glaring complaints:1. The dreamworld/reality plot labyrinth was foolishly summarized like a 3rd-grade book report... twice.2. All that build-up, dreams piled on top of dreams, masquerading as a possible crime story, all the while instructing us not to take everything at face value... and all it amounts to is ____________ ?!!No, I don't want to ruin it for everyone, but its almost as if Cameron Crowe wrote himself into a corner, grabbed the screenwriter's bible on coy-plot-developments-that-can-get-you-out-of-any-jam, and just plugged in the latest in hack sci-fi vision-of-the-future crap.  A note to Crowe:  If your entire film amounts to _________ , make sure you craft it in such a way that we care when we finally do find out.  Or better yet, take advantage of the mesmerizing first 2/3rds by having it all amount to something original and thought provoking.",Vanilla Sky
317,dg-op,Do not open your eyes! Close them and DON'T watch this film!,1,17 January 2010,"It's a fact. The few ones that consider ""Vanilla Sky"" a good movie (or even great ¿?) have not seen the ""real"" movie, Spaniard ""Abre los ojos"" by Alejandro Amenábar.It's common in the American film industry to see remakes of foreign films, due to the fact that usually, the traditional American film consumer will not watch a subtitled film. It happened with Amenábar's firs film ""Thesis"" with a very poor result. It is the same with Vanilla Sky.First, the performers. We have a non convincing Tom Cruise, which has had much better roles in his career (just remember ""Magnolia"" and you'll understand what I'm talking about). Cameron Diaz -considered by many as a not serious actress- plays a whore, not the interesting, bitter character played by Najwa Rimji in ""Abre los ojos"". Penelope Cruz, doing the same role, fails to achieve the complex performance in the original film. Finally, while McCabe (Kurt Russell) is just ridiculous, Jason Lee does a decent job as Brian Shelby.Second, Crowe proves everyone (and perhaps himself) that he's just a mediocre director: the story is too complex for his abilities. His script is just awful: it makes the story just stupid! In his next work, ""Elizabethtown"", he's just a decent director. But the bitter taste of this awful movie is still in me.

Not a chance!I often judge how good a film is based on how much emotion it evokes, and it is no exaggeration in saying that this is a true masterpiece that burrows deep into one's heart and toys with the emotions you thought you never had. Loneliness, regrets, longing, you name it. It's simply inexplicable.I watched this film years ago, but here I am, still getting this tingling sensation while I'm typing this and listening to the soundtrack (Sigur ros - The nothing song).

His life changes drastically when he meets with an accident while being in the car with his resentful ex Julie Gianni(Cameron Diaz), that leaves his face hideously disfigured. What follows is a tale of love, loneliness, longing and all the evil tricks that the mind plays. One of Tom Cruise's finest acting, I believe. I too got pulled along with David Aames's emotional tug-of-war. His portrayal of the character is simply amazing.

Unfortunately, they are using an ultra-talented film maker to display this dreck of a script. Cameron Crowe, if you are reading this, get back to the golden path you jumped off of too quickly. Get back to the characters that were enjoyable to watch, observe and like. Don't get me wrong, the acting was phenominal, but what was lacking was the COMMON SENSE to avoid listening to Tom Cruise's beliefs of Scientology being evoked in the script. It smacked of the John Travolta/Stinker of the Year-Battlefield Earth which tried to do the same and wasted a great cast while doing it.Yes, the main character needed to be ""cleansed"" of all of the nasty money and beautiful women that were ruining his life, and start anew. I felt like the entire movie was a audit of the main characters life. The only thing missing was two cans attached to E-meter for the audience to hold on to.I'm going to go now and plug in Citizen Kane into the DVD. Now that is a movie, and hopefully it will make me forget of the nine hard earned dollars I just wasted.",Vanilla Sky

Vanilla Sky was a great original idea which kept you guessing throughout the whole movie.Tom Cruise (shunned from a Best Actor Nomination) does an excellent job in his role as a confused, depressed man on the verge of insanity.  The direction is amazing with the constant flashes and repeating of lines previously heard throughout the movie.  Halfway through the movie you feel like you haven't even watch anything because you are so confused yourself. In this way you are drawn into Tom Cruise's character.
Seeing it the second time you pick up on everything, which just makes the movie that much better.9/10I also recommend Memento and Fight Club.",Vanilla Sky
323,Jeff-197,"new face to: ""and it was all a dream""",1,15 December 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** When I was in grammar school, my friends and I went through a phase where all of our journal entries, the stories we wrote for class, would end in ""and it was all a dream"", or ""and then I woke up"".  I'm sure you're familiar with this device... make a crazy scenario, make the audience wonder how the hero/heroine will escape, and then ""wake up"". Suppose we had been able to, back then, replace ""and then I woke up"" with ""and then I realized that I was cryogenically frozen and was experiencing a programmed brain-input deally"".  We'd have written Vanilla Sky.Basically, that's your whole movie.  Guy gets into weird situation, you think he's killed someone, you're teased with a mystery (who did he kill, and did he), teased with conspiracy (did they frame him), and then it ALL GETS THROWN OUT THE WINDOW for the same ending my pals and I used in the FOURTH GRADE!!The advertisements for this film tease you into thinking it will be an action-drama with a murder mystery.  Just when the film gets you compelled with this apparent plot development (not an easy task with drawn-out boring scenes, typically crappy Cruise acting, and a lead character that probably 1% of America can identify with)... just as it gets you into that, it says ""gotcha"", and goes into a laughable (people in my theater did groan and laugh) sci-fi bailout.This could have been a good movie.  I was expecting a REAL twist with a plot against David and a switcheroo of sorts with the women in his life.  They could have gone so many interesting places with this situation, and then they throw it out instead of exploring it (and they throw it out fast, before we can even enjoy the suspense) and go into what equates to ""it was all a dream"".And then they even spoon-feed you the details!!  ""When did the Lucid Dream begin?"", David asks... AND THE GUY TELLS YOU!!  ""Well, it was when you woke up in the street"".  Why, oh why, couln't I have been left to at least try to figure that out for myself??  Why did they have to GIVE it to me?And why wasn't the relationship with David and Sophia (which was actually a Lucid Dream) explored more?  There was like 2 scenes, and then we got into the murder crap.  Why was I supposed to feel anything for David and Sophia (and feel his pain) when they barely developed that  relationship?The reason they are saying that reviewers should ""not reveal secrets"" about this movies plot is because (a) if you said one or two sentences, the whole movies would be shot, as it takes only that one lame turn... and (b) if people knew that the ending was this cheezy, they would never come into the theater to see it.",Vanilla Sky

This newer version is actually more enjoyable to watch, the visuals are fantastic and the story is pretty much just as it was in the original, which everyone said was great.

That dumbs it way down because the explanation is funny but not interesting. It also goes all simple-moral at the end (spoiler!) but that doesn't work because Tom Cruise wears a rubber mask for about a fourth of the movie, a rubber disfiguring prosthesis for another fourth and a huge smirk the rest of the time. Lots of energy, but any character development takes place behind the latex where we can't see it. Cameron Diaz does the best work - her huge smirk is quite scary. Penelope Cruz, the Good Woman, is perky rather than manic, sweet but not demanding, and not at all threatening (yawn). The cinematography is flashy and fun.  I haven't see the Spanish original but  the director, Amenabar, has two pictures playing:  The Others and The Devil's Backbone.  They both have what Vanilla Sky lacks: feeling.",Vanilla Sky

I think the bottom line is that for TC to be in a good role, he has to get his face bashed in. Maybe it was Kidman holding him down, but there's an outside chance that TC may actually be able to act. This is an order of magnitude better than any other role that TC has had.There are a few slips with the direction, but to fair, the storyline is just a bit more complex than ""A good looking guy gets a job in a bar and gets laid"" The biggest issue for me was the soundtrack at times was too intrusive into the storyline for me. As for the ending, well, you'd have to make a pretty good case to me in order to dump Penelope Cruz as my girlfriend. Only Tom Cruise could be having sex with PC who then turns into an orgasmic Cameron Diaz and think he's having a nightmare. The only way it could get better would be if she turned into a six-pack of beer and a pizza afterward. Or to have both at the same time, but I digress...",Vanilla Sky

We just wanted to be entertained!Penelope Cruz looked ill, and anaemic, she is not my favorite Actress but she did not shine like the Original, because Tom would be over-shadowed. In the original, Penny was a penniless student (pardon the pun!), but you feel for her, but not as a Dancer in this movie, because Dancers can easily become strippers making a grand a week!-No sympathy vote here. What is worse is that Tom and Penny's love-making scenes are like accidentally walking into you parents- So Cheesy! playing with a mole on her chest???? EVEN THE CAMERA LOOKS AWAY TO THE BED BOARD TO PASS THE TIME! The Movie critics across the Atlantic commented on Tom and Penny's disability to set the scene on fire, like Penny was with the original star, Edwardo Noreiga, as the good-looking playboy - at least they made you feel lonesome.Kurt Russell was a waste of talent.Diaz lacks sympathy as a Psycho b**** from hell, who still confuses herself as a Charlie's angel kicking Tom's butt "" oh!

His character is so fundamentally narcissistic and unsympathetic that I found it impossible to care about him. Cruise spends much of the movie giving his ""Wow, you just blew my mind"" reaction as a way of indelicately telling the audience what a ""heavy"" movie this is.

Something that made sense to the previews. ] In the ads, they make it look like Cameron Diaz is trying to blackmail him into being charged for murder, when that is not how the movie goes at all.

Dreams have had a rebirth in the medium of motion pictures, and why not?  They're fertile ground for material and give the director a much more broad visual landscape.  Remember when studios had animated bugs, haunted houses and comets battling each other at the box office?  And they say the movie industry's gone down the toilet.""Vanilla Sky"" is a remake of the 1997 Spanish film called ""Abre Los Ojos."" That film was directed by Alejandro Amenabar.  While I admire Amenabar's work, (He went on to direct ""The Others."") his source material doesn't hold a candle to the remake by vastly underrated writer-director Cameron Crowe. Crowe has done two personal and character driven masterpieces (""Say Anything..."" and ""Almost Famous."") and I must admit that I had some hesitancy to see the advanced screening that I saw this evening.  Crowe's forte is small, personal films, and the previews would have us believe that this is some super-charged erotic thriller designed purely to earn untold millions.  But in reality, ""Vanilla Sky"" is anything but.  What I love about Crowe's films is that his characters always have the right things to say. Not so much in the dialogue sense, but in the fact that one line an actor can deliver can give a very real sense of a feeling or an emotion.And the cast Crowe has wrangled to deliver these lines is top notch. Penelope Cruz gives off great vulnerability that would not be normally seen when her sex kitten image is taken into account.  Cameron Diaz is very good at using her face to reveal dark undertones through a sunny demeanor.  Jason Lee has a believability that could convince one that he could walk off the screen and talk to you.  But the really impressive performance is by Tom Cruise, who plays a millionaire womanizer who is horribly disfigured after a car accident.  He hits his notes of bitterness very well, considering that he's Tom Cruise and has precious damn little to be bitter about.""Vanilla Sky"" is so full of secrets that I've probably given a few away already with out having meant to.  Sorry about that. But this movie is about the domain of dreams, and the only problem I have with ""Vanilla Sky"" is at the end, everything is explained.  This is not bad in and of itself, but ""Mulholland Drive,"" David Lynch's far superior film, deliberately didn't explain anything.  That left the viewer with an urge to make up an explanation and become an armchair Freud.  This leaves you with nothing to say but ""Wow.  That was a good movie.""***1/2 out of 4",Vanilla Sky
334,Fred-S,Not Nearly As Good As Open Your Eyes,7,7 August 2009,"I saw Vanilla Sky when it was first released in 2001 and then again on DVD about a month ago. In reading reviews on IMDb I discovered that it was a remake of a Spanish movie, Open You Eyes, and so I ordered it from Netflix as well. Penelope Cruz is the only cast member in both versions. She plays the role of Sofia and does a masterful job. The story is almost exactly the same scene by scene and even in dialogue. But, the ALMOST is significant. When I saw Vanilla Sky, I thought it was pretty good. I did think that it left too much unresolved and an extra scene (which I didn't know was extra at the time), further clouded the resolution with no apparent value to the movie. Ambiguity isn't always bad in a story, but I felt that the resolution in Open Your Eyes was exactly what was appropriate for the movie. I also felt that the scenery-chewing that Tom Cruise did in several scenes of the American version actually detracted from the feel of the story line.There is a bar scene that is almost identical, word for word, in the two films. The only difference is the tone and body language of the main character and the bartender, which makes the Vanilla Sky version quite confrontational while in the Spanish version the scene plays as a simple faux pas on the part of the bartender that is quickly resolved. Again, I thought the confrontation was unnecessary and, I would hope, unrealistic.In general, I think the American version suffers from inferior direction and poorer acting. Penelope Cruz is excellent in both. Cruise and Kurt Russell seem to have decided that their roles needed to big bigger and more emotional. They were wrong.If you are really interested in film making, I suggest you watch both and see how seemingly small changes can change the ""feel"" of a movie. Otherwise, I recommend Open Your Eyes.",Vanilla Sky
335,ennyman,"Surreal, Beautiful, Tragic, Wondrous...",10,19 February 2008,"""The little things. There's nothing bigger, is there?"" ~ Tom Cruise, Vanilla Sky In 2001 Cameron Crowe created an incredible film. Now why it is that some movies resonate with us and others fail to connect, I am not sure. In part, the masterpieces simply have no hollow notes. The director somehow brings out stellar performances from his cast and makes no compromises along the way. It helps, of course, to have a magical script, and the film Vanilla Sky explodes with layers of meaning that go deep to make it a very special film.I can think of two reasons this film has been panned by a segment of the public. One is that Tom Cruise is the star, and for this reason alone it might be dismissed by some. This is an incredible performance, however, and can't be so easily dismissed. A second reason is that the film is a remake in English of a Spanish version of the same story, starring the same Penelope Cruz. Who cares? I did not see the Spanish version. I saw this one.The film is complicated, and requires a measure of work on the part of the viewer. If you have to see it twice to see that the continuity is there, maybe that is OK. The film hangs together and is not a manipulation with a twist ending. Yes, the ending twists, but is a logical extension of the story.For me, the scene in the middle where Tom Cruise is dancing with the mask on the back of his head is so fabulously conceived for its symbolic value, for Cruise become Janus, the Roman mythological figure with two faces. Janus was the god of gates or doors, doorways, beginnings and endings. In this film, though we know it no, the scene telegraphs the pivotal transition for David Aames, who has been tragically disfigured as a result of his own choices. Sometimes, you can learn from the past but can't change it.I am not certain what it is that so resonates with me about this film. In part, it may be the philosophical questions it raises about who we are, and the life we would live if we could truly live our dreams. Or maybe, it is simply the identification with the profoundly tragic thing that happened to this man, the pain he inflicted on his friends, the grief he  and they -- must have experienced.It is interesting, too, that the Cruz character is named Sofia, the Greek word for wisdom. The symbols, the erudite references throughout, the layers of complexity may be simply too much for a typical audience given to pop entertainment values. Or maybe I am too sentimental to be properly critical, since at least one poll rated this one of the worst films of all time.The film is atypical in structure, and a bit labyrinthine as one circles through the maze of story lines. But it is not utterly inaccessible. One can ""get it"" because there is something to get. It is not simply a manipulation.Much more could be said than this, but others have said it already, so I simply close with this. For me, the wonder of the film is summed up in three words: Open Your Eyes.",Vanilla Sky
336,mittens-and-matches,Pretty good but fails to live up to the original,4,14 July 2012,"Most people are probably not aware that this is a remake of the movie ""Abre Los Ojos"". Its not inspired by ""Abre Los Ojos"" it literally is a remake following the plot and original scenes nearly exactly. I am lucky to have read several reviews of Vanilla Sky suggesting to watch the original (which is in Spanish) before Vanilla Sky. I can only agree.In Vanilla Sky Tom Cruise delivers a nice performance. In fact, his performance (aside from a couple things he does in here that are just bizarre) along with the script are what carry the film. However, Eduardo Noriega, the original actor, delivers a better performance. Penelope Cruz actually plays the same character in both movies. However, she is better in the original for a few reasons. One, she gives a more nuanced performance and comes across better in her native tongue, two, she has better chemistry on screen with Eduardo, and three, her character makes more sense playing opposite the rival girl in the original than opposite Cameron Diaz who is a little too charismatic and beautiful to be playing the role of second best.The original also never lapses into mediocrity. However, here there are a number of scenes where the acting or some of the secondary characters wanes. The ending in Vanilla Sky also was shot in a way that unfortunately cheapens and takes away some of the impact of the original script (I don't want to say more and spoil it).In short, I found Vanilla Sky to be an interesting watch especially as I was able to compare it to Abre Los Ojos in every scene. It is understandable that producers would want to bring the story and script of Abre Los Ojos to a more mainstream audience, as it is brilliant, and therefore make Vanilla Sky. However, as often happens with remakes this one lacks the power of the original and I can only really recommend to you to see the original first.",Vanilla Sky

Seems to me that at some point the viewer decides if the reward is worth the lifting and personally by the 90 minute mark I had decided that no ""explanation"" in the conclusion was going to balance out the tedium of the action. Did Cruise deserve to be wealthy? Probably no. Was he responsible? Not much. Did he ""use"" Diaz? Yes. Was she using him? Seems like it.  Did his getting into the car with Diaz after his night with Cruz justify the results? By what yardstick? Do we care about Cruise or Diaz as people? Cruz was ""cute"" but Cruise was unconvincing. Weak science fiction at the conclusion.

This is a viable and sound explanation, for there are many people that go crazy and hallucinate. I thought that it was a true portrait of insanity.  I could have lived with that explanation.

339,jasonw-5,Disappointed in Crowe,2,13 December 2001,"1 out of 4Audiences in search of a mind trip filled with mystery and suspense  need to see something else.  Vanilla Sky takes you on a mind trip all right, but its ever-changing narrative and uniquely mysterious characters are only contrived elements in a story that lacks focus.  After two hours of questions, the premise of the entire film is summed up in ten minutes of flashbacks and explanation physically ripping the wind out of any hope you may have had for it.Tom Cruise plays David Ames a millionaire magazine publisher with the world at his feet.  Beautiful women want him and success has never come easier. Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) is one of those women but is unwilling to share him with his new love interest, Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz).  Julie causes an accident that leaves David with a mutilated face and ever-present migraines.  His world is falling apart around him and nobody has the answers.Cameron Crowe is generally a brilliant director.  Say Anything, Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous are great rides into the lives of their lead characters what makes them laugh and what makes them cry.  That sense of direction is evident in Vanilla Sky but too little emphasis is placed on the relationships.  Instead Crowe focuses on a mystery about murder and betrayal reaching outside of his comfort zone and failing.Some of the performances are good but too many are awful.  Cameron Diaz stretches well in a `Fatal Attraction' evil that transcends her `girl next door' persona and Jason Lee shines as David's best friend and confidant with a quick wit and irascible charm.  Cruise gives us nothing new with his rich kid who can't seem to control his life character and the other Cruz is just downright unwatchable as an unintelligent waif riding on the coattails of everyone she meets.If you're dragged kicking and screaming to this film you had better be prepared to sit through hours of strange and unengaging drama only to find that the wait was never worth it.",Vanilla Sky

341,iqjumpuw,Mind Blowing,9,15 December 2001,"First of all...  WOW!  What an experience.David Aames (Tom Cruise) had what other people would call, ""A Perfect Life."" He meets a girl named Sofia (Penélope Cruz) and immediately falls in love with her and weird things start happening.The acting and plot were terrific.  The character development was excellent! Until the very end of this movie, it makes you wonder if this is a good movie or a bad movie.  It puts you in a very weird mood and it's so confusing you don't know what is real.  It's that weird feeling that makes you wonder. Both Penélope Cruz and Cameron Diaz were absolutely gorgeous.  I couldn't think of anyone that could've done a better job.  Penélope Cruz was very sweet as always and Cameron Diaz did an outstanding job being a bad girl in this movie.  Jason Lee and Kurt Russell were wonderful too.Prepare to get blown away and go see it right now.  It was definitely worth my $8.00.  No one should give away the ending of this movie.  It will be hard to explain even if they wanted to.10/10",Vanilla Sky

'Abres Los Ojos' Re-do deserved better treatment",4,17 December 2001,"Stanley Kubrick worked with Tom Cruise for over two years, to produce the highly anticipated, visually stunning failure, 'Eyes Wide Shut'. Cruise should still have stretch marks from that fiasco. Tom Cruise seems to be a very sincere, and extremely hard-working actor, unfortunately, he must have believed Cameron Crowe could actually make a more superior psychological thriller than Kubrick; which seems kind of silly. 'Vanilla Sky' is an glossy, manipulative, and ultimately insulting attempt to convince viewers, they are actually watching a very cerebral psycho-erotic work of art. Tom Cruise is once again, out of his element, especially during the painfully absurd psycho-cinema portions of this film. Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' was a visually stylish and beguiling film, which made the Tom Cruise character seem more out of place. 'Vanilla Sky' is a handsome film; but the director's sloppy and manipulative antics are so ridiculous, that Tom Cruise looks pretty good in comparison. The other performances were competent, and I agree with those who feel Penelope Cruz was better in the original film. Also, a tighter film edit may have helped this film. 4/10, mainly for poor direction, and Tom's poor judgment.",Vanilla Sky

The movie begans to get scary when Cameron Diaz commits suicide by driving her car off a bridge. But, Tom Cruise was also in the car.

344,Moika,"Interesting, but Crowe doesn't live up to his potential.",7,16 December 2001,"I don't want to give anything away, because this film certainly is thought provoking.  There were parts I really enjoyed and parts, I felt, left something to be desired.  Cameron Crowe proved that he was a worthy film maker with ""Jerry Maguire"" and that he was an exceptional film maker with the astonishingly good ""Almost Famous"".  That said, ""Vanilla Sky"" just didn't measure up.  At times I felt the acting was sub-par (with the exception of Cameron Diaz, who is always good), and that the film didn't know what it wanted to be.  Is it a romance, a mystery, or a science fiction film?  I think part of the problem stems from the fact that this was not really Cameron Crowe's movie, unlike ""Say Anything"", ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Almost Famous"".  Instead it was a remake of a 1997 film, which I haven't seen but understand to be quite good (why would a film maker want to remake a film which is only four years old?).  His earlier projects were films about people.  That is what is so wonderful about them.  With the release of ""Almost Famous"" it seemed that no one was better a putting real life on the screen than Cameron Crowe.  ""Vanilla Sky"" however, is not about people, and this is most likely where it falls short.  There was no Cameron Crowe within the film, unlike ""Almost Famous"", which is all Cameron Crowe.  All of the world's best art comes from within the artist, this film came from within the guy who directed ""The Others"".With all of that in mind (and I realize it is a lot), ""Vanilla Sky"" is not a bad movie.  As a Crowe fan, my expectations were naturally quite high, and the film didn't live up to them.  However, I certainly suggest that you go see it, and draw your own conclusions.  I gave it a 7 out of 10.  The film is visually beautiful (not to mention the cast) and it will serve as a good conversational piece, if nothing else.",Vanilla Sky

348,hellraiser40,Open your eyes and you will notice the mistakes,5,28 July 2002,"Abre Los Ojos was a great film, with solid performances, haunting atmospherics and a unexpected, original ending. Vanilla Sky is the remake, a film that tries to copy Abre Los Ojos and fails rather miserably.In fact, you can say it very simple : if you have only watched Vanilla Sky, than you're in for a movie that reaches some nice intellectual heights for an American movie with an original ending. But, if you see this movie and then see the original (or if you had already seen that one), Vanilla Sky suddenly becomes a quite lame movie. Which is a shame actually, because I like Tom Cruise and certainly because he has given the attention to Amenabar he deserves. Cruise has always been to me one of better actors in America. But Cruise should have known that the quality of the original could never have been injected in the remake. There are a lot of things which make the original better, but now I'm going to give the 3 main points why this movie is way underneath the original :1)the performances : how hard Cruise tries, he never puts as much tragedy and quality in his role as Eduardo Noriega. But this goes for every actor here (also Cruz, who had a more sharp, vivid character in the original)2)the approach : the original is more scary, leaves more to the imagination of the audience and has a better ending (yes, vanilla sky manages to remove some of the intensity of the original ending!!)3)the music!!! : although the songs on their own are good (2 songs from my fave band REM), the music is just totally inappropriate and actually ruins some of the scenes. you know what i'm talking about when you can compare the 2 moviestherefore 1 advice : just go see Abre Los Ojos and wait until Vanilla Sky comes on television, late at night. Ironically, that's what the special featurette on the VHS edition suggests!!!",Vanilla Sky

350,Queen_of_Convenience,Strange but completely enjoyable...,10,8 June 2002,"First off, I must say that this film is not for everyone. I feel that it's only for those with an open mind - and that would include myself. I watched in wonder for the whole film, not knowing what was coming next. I even felt 'creeped out' during some parts (if you've seen it, you probably know which parts I'm talking about). I love that feeling of confusion when watching a movie and then the blast of ""...Ohhhhhh!!"" when it's done, like you finally figured it out. That's what happened with me and this movie. Now, I usually have a favorite character or one that I relate with the most in each movie I watch. My favorite was the elusive English man, Edmund Ventura (portrayed by Noah Taylor). He always looked nice in his suit and I love his accent. At first, he kind of gave me chills, but after a while I began to feel comfortable with him. Every once in a while a sly smile would creep across his face and I loved that. All in all, I enjoyed this film a great deal and recommend it to anyone looking for a mind-boggling experience.",Vanilla Sky
351,celticjunkie,Tom Cruise at his best,9,22 August 2009,"OK, so I know I am late to this Vanilla Sky party, but I finally watched this DVD after seeing it sit on my shelf for a couple of years, and I was just blown away. I expected to hate it but I loved it, and my husband and I sat spellbound from start to finish. The film is sometimes a dream, then it is reality, then just a dream, it totally messes with your head. Makes you think. Makes you feel.Definitely, without a doubt, Cruise's best dramatic performance. Fantastic. He starts the film as a playboy, all full of himself, charming. Then he transforms into a bitter, tortured man. Unsettling to see, whether behind the mask or with his disfigurement showing. I felt his anguish.And Penelope Cruz, long before her brazen performance in Vicky Cristina Barcelona, making us fall for her. Beautiful, heartfelt. And Cameron Diaz is convincing as the messed-up stalker girlfriend you don't quite expect to see. ""Earl"" (Jason Lee) is also good as Cruise's only friend. It took me awhile to realize it was ""Earl,"" because he looks so different in this film.And the Manhattan exterior shots, how cool were they? The early scene when Cruise is all alone in Times Square. And the skyline! I did get sad when the Twin Towers appeared in the film, during the rooftop scene at the end, and I remembered that there was some hot discussion about the film when it premiered regarding the shot of the WTC and also Cruise diving from a skyscraper, but it reinforces that the setting was real. (Except...... it would not make sense to show the Towers if the last scene takes place far into the future -- the Towers would be gone, I guess. I don't know. Being from NY I guess I am extra sensitive about films with the Towers in them.) Anyway, this is the 3rd ""mind-bending"" film with Cruise that I have seen (Magnolia and Eyes Wide Shut being the other 2) and this is my favorite by a wide margin.",Vanilla Sky
352,wainot,"I wanted to like this movie, but ...",6,12 July 2004,"I just saw this on dvd. This was a movie that I wanted to embrace, but just could not.  To back up for a moment, I never saw the Spanish language film on which it was based, Abre Los Ojos.  So, whether that film was far superior, about the same, or somehow not as good, is irrelevant - for this purpose.The performances were fair to good - Cruise is a reliably good actor - this represents a solid performance.  Cameron Diaz was pretty good, Jason Lee did fine, but Penelope Cruz's acting (now, at times she looked gorgeous, and watching her dance is a pleasure) left something to be desired.  My guess (judging from this and Captain Correlli's Mandolin)is that she is much better, and much more natural in Spanish language films.  But, even w/ a great performance by her, this film would not be very good.I believe the set-up is ok, and some of the ideas expressed are pretty good, but the story is somehow a little bit self-important or trying too hard to say something or to provide twists.  I don't believe this is Cameron Crowe's best work at all.  I liked Almost Famous a lot, and actually think Jerry Maguire was one of the superb works of the 90's.  Look at Crowe's writing, and the performances from everyone in the JM cast-- almost, a perfect mix of dramatic tension and comedy).  And, I know that this is a different style film, but I felt that the music (he does have good taste in music) was a substitute for memorable dialogue or pacing -- it just felt like a bad montage of music videos.  The movie repeats lines of dialogue as if they are the most clever things ever written, but they're just ok.  And then, the movie has, in my opinion, the nerve to steal a scene and the wonderful score from To Kill A Mockingbird (off a flimsy pretext), when Vanilla Sky couldn't ""carry Mockingbird's jock"", so to speak...Anyway, this film just seemed too self-conscious and too derivative of other films to really go anywhere.  Not a terrible flick, but for me about a 6.5 out of 10.",Vanilla Sky

354,joughin,A painful waste of time.,1,9 May 2007,"There were lots of these movies through the 90s - Groundhog Day, Strange Days, The Truman Show, The Matrix, Pleasantville, Memento and others, using Film as a metaphor for an illusory life. I liked most of them... but found this late arrival relentlessly contrived, pretentious, narcissistic, vacuous, tedious...It would have been better if they'd just played it all out in front of a big mirror as home entertainment, with loads of breaks for self-congratulation. In fact, most of the time, looking at the screen was like staring cringefully at the hammy acting, lousy direction and terrible script through a two-way mirror. Why did all these sad characters have to rope in a cinema audience to convince themselves how hip and clever they were? I thought Tarantino was the ne plus ultra of pretentious narcissism. This runs him pretty close, without the art.I guess you'd call this self-conscious tripe 'postmodern'. It's basically a very old genre - as old as the illusion of moving pictures themselves. There are great German Expressionist examples, like Nosferatu - but my all-time favourite is Jacques Rivette's Céline et Julie vont en Bateau (1974). It is not 10, but a thousand times better than this embarrassing dross, and infinitely more engaging, imaginative and playful. See it instead.

Tom Cruise is nothing short of perfect in his portrayal of pretty boy David Aames. His supporting cast is magnificent also. Pretty soon you won't be able to believe your eyes or your mind. It is tough to review the film without giving away even the smallest things, which is what the movie is ultimately about. The smallest things in life that matter to us. A walk through the snow, a father to son chat, or a freckle...Vanilla Sky is a great, psychological thriller. If you walk out on the movie and say it was stupid because it was too far fetched, you are missing the concept. How many new ideas are out there today in movies.

356,jrm-3,Worst Movie of the Year,1,3 January 2002,"This was the worst movie I saw last year, and I saw some doozies (Corky Romano, Freddy Got Fingered...)  That acting, directing, editing, and soundtrack to this film are all horrible.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.Let's start with the plot.  Normally, I enjoy somewhat confusing movies, whether they explain themselves in the end (Memento) or leave you wondering ""Huh?"" (Mulholland Falls).  But THIS movie just made me angry.First of all, Tom Cruise's character was an arrogant, cocky, rich kid that the audience immediately disliked.  He used women, he never really worked all that hard, and everything in life had come easy for him.  For the first 15 minutes, Tom Cruise simply walks around and flashes his annoying smile.
Then Penelope Cruz comes into the picture, and suddenly we're thrown into a confusing mess of a story.  Is Cameron Diaz really dead?  Is Penelope Cruz actually Cameron Diaz?  Did Tom Cruise kill somebody?  Did the Phantom of the Opera loan his mask to Tom Cruise?  Did Kurt Russell suddenly forget his daughter's names?   (If you think these questions are confusing, they're ACTUAL questions posed by the plotline....so if you think they sound dumb then you must agree to stay away from this film!)  The plot literally folds in on itself numerous times, but when it finally offers an answer to all the confusion, you just want to throw your popcorn at the screen and yell obscenities at the writers.  The ""explanation""--if you can call it that--is completely absurd.Then we have the acting.  I've never been so annoyed with Tom Cruise before in my life.  He needs to stop playing over confident characters who are suddenly challenged a la Jerry McGuire, Maverick, etc....  After the accident that disfigures his face, Tom's acting takes a nosedive into bizarroland.  Wearing a latex mask, he stalks around nightclubs, muttering about regaining his life, blah blah blah....  He must have had his eyes wide shut when he received this script.  Then we have Penelope Cruz.... If she said ""Open your Eyes!"" one more time, I would have left the theatre.  Her character was a cardboard figure that you couldn't possibly understand, and it never seemed clear why Cruise was so madly in love with her character. She seemed strange and stale to me.  And Cameron ""do you believe in God"" Diaz....maybe it was just the writing, but her character was so filled with ""crazy girlfriend"" stereotypes--right down to the stalking scene at the party--that I cringed every time I saw her.I could go on and on about the inappropriate soundtrack--why Radiohead and REM appear in a movie like this is beyond me--and they horrible editing (so quick and incomprehensible...Look!  There's Cameron Diaz's face saying Boo! There's Penelope Cruz in a wedding dress on the bed!  Did you miss that? Oh who cares!!!).  Bottom line--if this review made no sense to you, then you have a small perception of what the film's like.  Stay away from this movie!!!",Vanilla Sky

This is a STAR VEHICLE, get it?)Now:is there anyone who likes Tom Cruise unreservedly? Or is that guy working all the angles behind that golden smile visible to everyone?Until ""Vanilla Sky"" I liked Tom Cruise - but with provisos.  Now I must admit: he CAN act (though his range is small) and (to his credit)he was willing to take a chance of losing his audience by hiding that fabulous Star-Face for so much of this unhappy story.The audience filed out as if unconscious before the credits started to roll, and I admit I suffered the same malaise. It was nothing so clear as ""I don't like it.""The uneasy feeling stayed with me.  In fact, it took me several hours to realize that I simply don't LIKE seeing Tom Cruise as a loser. Life is complicated enough.  I was to see a jaunty happy hero, the place wherein all his attraction lies. (And I'm not a kid; the heroes of my twenties have been dying off for about five years from natural causes.)When I go to see Tom Cruise I want him to be the Tom Cruise climbing the sheer rock face at the beginning of ""Mission Impossible 2"".

Let me just say one thing: Sit back and relax, and don't worry about figuring it out - it will do it for you.  I wasted about an hour trying to figure it out, then let myself go to enjoy it.Tom Cruise was great in this movie.  He played the ""cocky young guy"" that he is so famous for, and turned right around into a complete different character after the accident - and so effectively.This is the first time I saw Penelope Cruz act, and I thought she was a great choice (although she played the same character in Open your Eyes). She reeks sensuality, and makes you wish you knew someone like her.Cameron Diaz, where not the person I would pick for raunchy sex scenes and profanity, was convincing in her portrayal of a ""stalker in love.""One thing I didn't care for was a sex scene towards the end that was a little too long and disturbing for my tastes, it added to the plot, but it wasn't necessary to shoot it like that.One more thing, I don't think you have to be the intellectual that many people are claiming to be that ""got"" the movie, I think that is a snobby thing to say, but you DO have to pay attention.",Vanilla Sky

I highly recommend this movie to everyone over the age of 18.I don't want to give away much of the plot but the camera work is very good throughout.  The story is superb and is explained fully by film's end. Far fetched, sure, but brilliant.  A true work of art.  The only negatives to me were the first 20-25 minutes of the film.  Tom Cruise is awfully cheesy during the first part of the movie.  Smiling all over the place for no particular reason.  But, once he finds a woman with whom he wishes to begin a true relationship, the movie really takes off and only gets better and better.  Good performances all around.Cameron Crowe did a fantastic job with this movie and anyone who wishes to be taken on a brilliantly confusing but fun ride should see it.

365,atomicblue,"Mysterious, fascinating study of identity and its meaning",9,2 June 2003,"It's a shame this movie was released at the time that it was. If it had been at any time other than just on the heels of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's highly public split, there might not have been such a huge holocaust against two of the three main stars of the movie.Essentially, this is a dream-like version of The Matrix. The same themes - that of reality and its fragility, identity and the power of perception - are covered, but they are given far more than the superficial treatment that The Wachowski Brothers gave them in The Matrix.Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a person whose life seems to have spiraled downhill since a car accident involving his lover, Julie (given a bit of an edge by Cameron Diaz). It's difficult to sum up the plot of the movie, and what I've just said sounds overly simplistic, but watching the movie yourself will give you a chance to really follow things.As the movie descends into a more and more dream-like state, it becomes increasingly apparent that David's world - which is actually a sort of induced dream in itself - has been affected by his own perceptions, subconscious fears and feelings.While the plot is occasionally difficult to follow, Cameron Crowe has delivered a highly original movie that stresses the control of our own subconscious over how we take in the world. The dream sequences are particularly interesting to watch, and the movie definitely requires a second viewing to take everything in.Try it. I think you might like it, presuming you don't dislike Tom Cruise.Grade: B+",Vanilla Sky

368,DocFilm,Why bother?,1,15 December 2006,"A remake of Alejandro Amenabar's Abre los Ojos, but this time with a living, breathing mask as a lead. For the dubious advantage of an English sound track, we endure Tom Cruise's soulless performance, as usual, with zero depth. Yes, the character is identified with his persona, but we usually are given some character underneath that to hold our interest. His empty posturing negates any erotic energy that could have been between his character and Cruz or Diaz.There is an acting exercise that involves using masks to free the actor to enrich his presentation of character by verbal and body language means. Cruise's masking only painfully emphasizes his inadequacy as an actor. Do see the 1997 original Amenabar Open Your Eyes!",Vanilla Sky
369,Glida,"Good intentions, noble failure",4,14 December 2001,"I was rooting for this film.  Cameron Crowe has made some of the best American commercial films in the last two decades, an oeuvre that includes: Fast times at Ridgemont High; Say Anything (arguably one of the best teen films ever made); Jerry Maguire; and the celebratory Almost Famous.  As always, Crowe was working with some of the best talents in the industry, including cinematographer John Toll (The Thin Red Line; Almost Famous) and a cast that included Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell (who hardly resembles Elvis here), Timothy Spall, Jason Lee, and a small part by the always remarkable Tilda Swinton.
So, what the hell went wrong?
In the film, Tom Cruise plays a CEO of a large corporation who is involved on a ""friend/lover"" basis with Cameron Diaz.  When he wakes up at the beginning of the movie, he hears Penelope Cruz's character telling him to wake up.  He does, and drives to Manhattan, which is totally devoid of people.  Then, he wakes up again....it was a dream.....only to hear Cameron Diaz's voice waking him.  Later, he meets Penelope Cruz's character at a party, accompanied by Jason Lee's character, who is Cruise's best friend. The chemistry between Cruise and Cruz is immediate.
At this point, VS takes off into a variety of directions involving various time shifts, including a car accident with the now stalking Diaz character which leaves her dead and Cruise horribly facially disfigured.  In an overlapping thread, he is charged with a murder, although the discourse doesn't let on exactly who he was alleged to have killed.  The leit motif of the movie is to ""wake up,"" as Cruise desperately tries to get clear about what is happening to him, what has happened to him, and where the tsunami of circumstances is taking him.  Eventually, he begins to question the very nature of his reality as he experiences his interpersonal, internal, and physical life collapsing at every turn.
Vanilla Sky is the latest addition to the '01 dreamscape genre following the absorbing noir Memento (not a dream, but plays like one), and two brilliant entries:  David Lynch's hypnotic and enigmatic Mulholland Drive; and the compelling Richard Linklater film, Waking Life.   These last three films are some of the finest movies of the year (all on my best 10 list), and a cross comparison with VS reveals a great deal.
Two of these better cinematic entries possess a cohesive center.  Even though Memento is a precise exercise in non-linearity, the film presents a strong central character with a connecting plot thread:  he has lost his short term memory, and is trying to go back in time to solve a murder. Waking Life takes its protagonist on a clear line of interactions with remarkable people.  The film-maker's reality comes to us at the same time as the protagonist's, which gives us the sense that we are journeying together with the dreamer.  Mulholland Drive appears to make no sense and would seem to suffer from the same problems as VS, but Lynch's cinematography is so mesmerizing, the acting so compelling, the writing so damn brilliant, the scenes so unforgettable, and so incomprehensively real and surreal, that it works anyway.....arguably, it might be the best film of the year.
But VS possesses a plot structure that keeps jerking the audience around; the discourse becomes increasingly incomprehensible which leaves the audience with a strained ability to relate to the characters and keep up with the capricious plot changes to the point where the audience becomes exhausted past the point of caring.  And the payoff, when it comes, seems weak and tacked on.  Ultimately, the ending  rearranges the film's tone and meaning which reduces it from an overly confused non-linearity to a trivial mess with a ""feel good"" message that seems even more pretentious and contrived than Spielberg's false endings in ""A.I.""
I'm reminded of a story involving James Stewart when he was originally offered to play Scotty in Hitchcock's Vertigo.  Initially, Stewart turned down the first draft of the script because he felt that the film had nothing to ground it in reality.  But, when Samuel Taylor rewrote the script and included Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes), Stewart was said to exclaim, ""Now we have a picture!"" because he correctly realized that now the film had a center that would give the audience a hook....someone with whom they could relate as the action became increasingly surreal and strange.  That, I believe, is the central problem with VS, which offers the viewer no center, and therefore no hope of maintaining verisimilitude.  Any connection the audience might hope to establish with the movie vanishes long before the film-makers flash the final credits.
**1/2 stars for me (despite the problems) for the good performances, the look of the film, Crowe's good intentions (a noble failure), and the fact that any film is automatically improved that involves Tilda Swinton.",Vanilla Sky

As much as I tried to figure out what was happening it was just not happening for me. Now, don't get me wrong there may be people out there who will say `this guys probably just too stupid to figure deep plot analysis' Doesn't he know that the face represented his sole and that he was screaming out because of his edopis complex or whatever. Or some such dribble. The movie is interesting in that I thought the acting was there. I thought Penelope Cruz was excellent and so was everyone else. The picture was pretty all around. The sets were interesting too. Times Square and all. It's just that I didn't get it. I just didn't get it. A few changes and this could have been a very good movie in my opinion.

The plot is well thought and goes beyond the typical thriller story. This movie is for people wanting more than just violence and guns. Be prepared for a bit of thinking and don't expect a ""vegetables watch"" type of movie.The US poster doesn't give justice to the movie and tries to promote Tom Cruise.

I wish I could see it ""for the first time"" again because Abre los Ojos was a masterpiece to me. Maybe I was SO deathly bored because I already knew what was going to happen? Also, please Mr Crowe, we know you love rock music but it's not a SUBSTITUTE for emotion. Please turn it dow, the old Monkees and Beach Boys makes this seem like a weak acid flick like Jack Nicholson's ""Psyche Out"".
	Penelope Cruz seemed like a much better actress with subtitles, the reading is so monotone. The Cameron Diaz character was better in the first film because there was less of a ""relationship"" between her and David and she was less attractive. This makes her more dangerous, the more casual realtionship makes David more of a heel. Crowe, of course, would hesitate to make any main character less than likable, especially Tom Cruise, a fine actor who is miscast as he brings too much audience presupposition to this. The dialoge is TOO MUCH, as Crowe seems to want to add more meaning, more statements to a fine film that simply weigh it down. Unlike most foreign films, you cannot find Abre los Ojos boring or pretentious even if you hated it. Sadly, we can't say that this time around.** 1/2 as my expectations may be too high compared to the first film, but the soundtrack and banter are too much.",Vanilla Sky

The writing, screenplay, dialogue and the beautiful cinematography where outstanding, but what really dazzled me was the extreme acting skill that was sieved out by the always excellent Cameron Crowe. I am not going to give away major spoilers, because i think this movie needs to be watched, as it is the only way to understand what was going on. I will give you a premise and a little to how each character contributes to the story.Tom Cruise plays a rich kid playboy who is living the dream. He has sex with Cameron Diaz whenever he wants to but has no intention of having relationship with her. Jason Lee plays his BF and employee. In walks Penelope Cruz who quickly absorbs Cruz with those puppy dog eyes that she does so well. After spending one night together, they part with the intention of nourishes their flourishing friendship. As he leaves her apartment that is when the story unfolds. And that is all I'm saying.Cruise brings his character to life, where you understand exactly what type of personality he is. A sincere man with money as a distraction. Although rich kids who have inherited fortunes as opposed to achieving it, already loses the character some points with the viewership but he played the role so well that he doesn't even drift to the side of irritation. As the events transpire we are swept away on a journey through David Aimes mind. The dream state and reality sweep so comfortably in and out of each other that at one point you don't know what or who to believe, which means we are now experiencing the exact emotions of the main character. A dream in a dream in a dream. You start wondering, ""ok, maybe now we're fine, we're back to earth and then you realize we are deeper now than ever before. The plot is tight and the ending delivers answers to all questions asked in the 2hrs preceding. Penelope Cruz was so ""the girl next door"", the one you'd take home to mum. We feel her love for him, or rather what he wished her love to be, I'm still debating that one with myself.You walk away from this glad yet sad, with a sense of victory but failure as well.

I remembered several endings as the movie unfolded; all of which were true and none of which were the conclusive one. It takes many twists and turns, all enthralling and ends with the worst twist in movies, ""It was all a dream.!"" but that's not the end of it either.

I liked Abre Los Ojos a lot, and therefore I also like this movie. Had I watched this one before the original I might have rated it higher, and I know it's not quite fair to this one to rate it based on another movie, but as it is such a close copy, that is were I stand now. Vanilla Sky does win points for better describing the main characters company problems, but loses points over all for not feeling quite as emotional as the original. I wouldn't advise against seeing Vanilla Sky, but I'd first direct you towards the original.

The story involves elements of romance, morality, murder-mystery, suspense and sci-fi and is generally an entertaining trip.I should add that the photography is also uniformly excellent and the insertion of various visual metaphors is beautiful once you realize what's going on.If you enjoy well-acted movies with twists and suspense, and are prepared to accept a slightly fantastic Philip K Dick style resolution, then this is a must-see. 9/10",Vanilla Sky
383,Jaimzay,A brave and noble failure,5,13 December 2002,"Here we have a mismatch of director and genre.  Cameron Crowe's warm, offbeat, and well-observed comedies put some pretty interesting characters onscreen who ring true in all sorts of little ways that make us love them or at least sympathize with them (if they are supposed to be badguys, but no one is truly bad in a Cameron Crowe movie).  He has a gift for capturing the innocence of awkwardness and a keen ear for dialogue.  He uses music to rhapsodize his scenes in memorable ways (e.g., ""In Your Eyes"" from ""Say Anything"", ""Tiny Dancer"" from ""Almost Famous"", that lovely Bruce Springsteen song in ""Jerry Maguire"", and the entire ""Singles"" soundtrack).All that said, watching ""Vanilla Sky"" is an uncomfortable experience, and in all the wrong ways.  Crowe proves clumsy when trying to weave an engaging mystery while doing the things he has always done to make a good movie. It's hard to have the warm fuzzies about characters when they're trapped in a trippy world that's hard to understand.  Crowe never seems to get the tone right, although Tom Cruise does all he can to do that tightrope walk between agony and ecstasy and cockiness and vulnerability that he has practically copyrighted.  Jason Lee only adds to the movie's awkwardness by stretching far beyond his range (he really needs to stick to comedy--as a dramatic actor he has two modes:  wise-cracking acerbic smart ass and yelling acerbic smart ass).  Penelope Cruz is just kinda there as the woman Cruise loves, but Cameron Diaz does some fine work in a thankless role of the jilted lover who bobs back and forth between flirtation, sadness, loneliness, desperation, jealousy, and finally rage.""Vanilla Sky"" is the kind of movie that you want to like because of how well it might have worked in different hands (and conversely, for the hands that dared to take it on in a bold step in a new direction career-wise).

Have not seen the Spanish film ""Open Your Eyes"" of which this is a remake, but this one was good enough for me to want to see it as well. Is it a love story? Not really, a sci-fi? Not really, a drama? kinda sorta, but really it's all of the above and shouldn't be categorized.The story although seemingly convoluted at first, stretches your mind and starts to make more sense as you realize Cruises' affliction is causing him some heavy head trips. Cruise holds his own as the central character carrying quite an acting burden as a self centered but likable rich boy, a total victim of circumstance, and a love smitten puppy to the amazingly attractive Penelope Cruz.Cameron Diaz has always been a favorite of mine: expressive and playful with an edge, and here she excels in the role. Penelope Cruz actually is her perfect antithesis: secure, natural, grounded, and utterly irresistible, which gives her enough power to convince us that even studly Tom Cruise had met his match.Enough said, can't say too much, but the story concept is very interesting and although at first I probably wouldn't have rented this film even upon recommendation, I am glad that I experienced it.

386,Milo_Milosovic,Disappointing,7,23 March 2014,"Every now and again I stumble across a film on TV and think, ""I'll give it a go."" Such was the case with Vanilla Sky, Cameron Crowe's 2001 remake of ""Abre Los Ojos."" Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a money-bags son of a publishing magnet who seems to have inherited it all: Cash, Cameron Diaz as a f**k-buddy, board-room power, a vintage Ferrari, Pete Townsend's smashed guitar in his living room. you know the usual stuff.So far – so good – so what? If you hadn't worked it out already David iswell bit of a c**k - especially when it comes to the ladies. However, exotic Latino dancer Penelope Cruz hoves into view David goes all gooey, puts his c**k away for a minute and feels a ""connection."" After a night of romantic chat and sofa spooning David skips off into the dawn with a song in his heart and a spring in his step. Cue bad stuff! Extremely bad stuff! David is suddenly accused of a murder, disfigured in a car-accident and plagued by memory-loss, vivid nightmares and an encroaching sense of paranoia. All of this he unloads on the manly shoulders of friendly neighbourhood police psychologist Kurt Russell.All well and good but we have a problem. I don't care about David. At. All. Tom cruise gives good slime-ball (see Magnolia previously) but in this case it felt like the film's undoing. Are we supposed to have some kind of empathy with this arrogant, breaded, misogynistic t**t? Nope, sorry. Don't care. Emotional investment down the pan. This isn't Cruise's fault, his character is so thinly drawn that the only engagement with him is disengagement. I just didn't care/ To be honest, I just wanted to be rid of his nightmares, flashbacks, murder-charge and incessant whining so I can spend time with supporting cast who seemed a damn sight more interesting.Ultimately, there's some interesting ideas trying to get out. Is real love transient? The consequence of actions? The power of memory within dreams? But, it all gets lost under a wave of indifference summed up by my mighty, ""Meh"" at the big reveal. You could say it's a precursor to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or Inception in scope but that would be bum-bitingly generous. It has neither the ambition, wit or creativity of either.

There is something about real life, the sourness with the sweetness, that is irreplaceable.Abre Los Ojos made me really appreciate the plot and the concept that the world can be dream-like where you choose everything that is happening.But Vanilla Sky made me appreciate more the need for authenticity of real life. Somehow a magical life where you are the star of the show and have everything seems to lack meaning.This film is so superb that words fail me.

The quality I appreciate the most in these films is that they require you to think for yourself to work out a valid interpretation of the film (or at the very least piece everything together in the right order). The biggest flaw in ""VS"" is therefore the last half hour, where everything is laid out for you in excruciating detail.As I said, I don't know if this is just a carbon copy of the original Spanish ending but either way I see it as an insult to the viewer. It's basically the director saying ""I'm sorry for having let you watch 2 hours of something that might seem confusing. Here - let me spell it out for you since you obviously didn't come to see a movie expecting to have to use your brain"".""Vanilla Sky"" is not art but entertainment, and half-decent entertainment at that. And while entertainment has its uses, I certainly wouldn't recommend the film to anyone.",Vanilla Sky
393,joelbklyn,Doesn't Quite Hit the Mark,4,2 June 2006,"VANILLA SKY (136 minutes in length) was far too long...far too tedious...far too often exasperatingly confusing for the ""message"" it had to deliver. The concept, however, was actually quite (sci-fi-ishly) captivating, despite the fact it had already been presented before via ""The Outer Limits"" and ""Amazing Stories"" (i.e., cryogenic freezing in conjunction with lucid dreaming). If you haven't seen VANILLA SKY already, well...if you're a rabid Tom Cruise fan, you just might be able to raise your tolerance level high enough, so that (unlike this writer) you won't have to sit through the film nervously fidgeting and fast-forwarding -- and wishing, at the end, it had managed to live up to its full potential.Joel Kovacik",Vanilla Sky
394,francoatgrex,Open your eyes,9,23 March 2002,"I personally liked this movie because that's my genre. However I know if you like plain movies and if u're not into alternative twists and psychology/parasychology then you wouldn't really appreciate Vanilla Sky. Anyway I read some reviews here and Jesus! Some guys not only write spoilers (which is bad enough), but they write wrong spoilers to mislead and confuse the reader (one I read said how he liked Cameron Diaz emptying Times Square! What the heck is that? This isn't the plot!) Anyway I advise you to go watch it, you won't regret it. I just have one criticism though: sometimes in the movie they mention some psychological/psychoanalytical technical terms but in a wrong setting, that irked me a bit in the beginning but then I realised that it's just a movie and they can modify stuff like they want, it doesn't have to be what it really is.",Vanilla Sky
395,garethwatkin,A List of Over-Rated Opinions Elaborately Explained.,5,27 February 2009,"I had high hopes for this film. Prior to watching, I had heard good things about it, and had also been informed, that there was a particularly clever and well-thought out twist awaiting the eager viewer at the end of the film. Sadly, for me, this was not so. Getting the criticism out of the way first, which'll provide me the opportunity to leave this review on a high note... Firstly, starting from the very beginning. I was quite disappointed with the opening. I watched this on Channel4, and stupidly, listening to the pre-film clip featuring a bunch of taxis in New York, I heard the presenter explain that next film is Vanilla Sky, which has one of the best opening sequences in any film. This got me on the edge of my seat, and why not? Television cannot be wrong right? (Apologies for the over-using the sarcasm) The opening sequence was good in what it was meant to be. But i was disappointed in it's choice of song. I'm an avid fan of Radiohead, and Everything In Its Right Place is one of my favourite songs, but for me, the song was unable to compliment the sequence, and the two juxtaposed each other. (However, in a sense, this can be viewed less as a criticism, and more as a praise, as the song itself is about juxtaposition.) Moving swiftly on, and away from the film's opening and going right into the deep end. (Metaphorically speaking, though it's not a particularly good one) The ending featured a twist (Which i shall not give away) which for one, appalled me. It went against everything i was ever taught in primary school. In basic learning! There are many other ways you could have ended the film, whilst retaining it's prominent themes. But this, did not, and i was appallingly disappointed. Now for the bit people love, as lovers of film hate reading criticism of films they like (Hell, do people ever give proper deserved ratings out of 10 any more?) There were positive parts to the film. For one, (Although i wasn't impressed with the choice in the opening scene) The soundtrack for this film is brilliant. Every song chosen (apart from the first one) are brilliant in complimenting the film, and matching to the vivid imagery displayed. I may not be tempted to buy the film, but i am very tempted to buy the soundtrack Another strong praise is actually Tom Cruise, who i take my hat off to, if i wore a hat, which i do, if you count a woolly winter hat as one, but i'm not wearing it now, so i shall only metaphorically take it off. Cruise, who is an actor i have little respect for, shines through in brilliant form in this film. He is supported by a very strong supporting cast of Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz, who provide mystery within Cruise's character's life, which for me was poorly summed up. For the people who say Cruise cannot act, this is a prime example of how he 'can' act. Another thing i liked within this film, was a small subtle thing. The references to French New Wave. By law, i'm supposed to hate French New Wave, having been forced to study it in my Film Studies classes, but oddly, i like the films, and it was amusing to spot posters of famous films like Breathless within this film. Last point i shall make, as no doubt, anyone who has had the capacity to read this far is probably bored out of their skull, and is wishing they had strayed over to the message boards to find posts 'not-by-me' (Which sadly, won't work either, as i've been vividly expressing the parts i dislike about this film) The other thing i loved was Mis-En-Scene, which ties in with my last praise for the film. There were some beautiful shots within this film, and although i may not have liked the concept of the ending sequence, i certainly loved the look of it. The beautiful sky, with it's rich colours. It was simply just beautiful to look at.Too sum up my elaborately labelled points which hold absolutely no relevance to anything whatsoever. This film for me, despite having it's good points, is simply average. Yes, i may have loved some parts, but there are a thousand other films which i like for the same reasons, and more! For me, this film just could not live up to it's terrible conclusion, and what might be unfair to describe as, but i'll say it anyway, over-rated beginning. Certainly watch this film, I'm never one to say what you should watch and what you shouldn't. But it's not a film i'll be re-watching in a hurry.",Vanilla Sky

397,gunnarvl,Maybe Tom Cruise's Best Performance,7,28 December 2004,"Vanilla Sky is a very strange, difficult, somewhat confusing, and different type of movie. I applaud Tom Cruise for taking the role, and he comes up aces. Many will not like the film and apparently most did not. Anyone interested in the science/theory of Cryogenics will find this film fascinating. Throughout the film I kept asking myself is this real or just imagined? I was not sure if I was witnessing dream sequences, or if what I was watching was supposed to be what really occurred. For me it all became clear in the end, which I loved. If you want to see Tom Cruise in a role where he is not playing Tom Cruise like he is in all of his other films, give this one a try, but go into it with an open mind.",Vanilla Sky
398,Spellvexit,A not-so-subtle Abre Los Ojos,7,1 April 2002,"Because the plot of Abre Los Ojos was so strong, it's difficult to give this movie a terrible rating.  I still enjoyed it and appreciated the romance and found it to be strangely magical in an urban kind of way.  However, Vanilla Sky takes too many cues from Hollywood -- most prominently the utter lack of subtlety by which Abre Los Ojos was crafted.  (slight spoiler)  The cryogenics theme is introduced too blatantly, and it's spelled out in mindnumbing detail later in the movie.  Tom Cruise's character is immediately stereotyped, whereas the protagonist in Abre Los Ojos had a playboy role that was more difficult to grapple with.  Just like the color of Vanilla Sky versus Abre Los Ojos, everything is sharper, less ambiguous, and... louder!  The music for the ""derangement"" scenes were all-out annoying and inappropriate, and seemed to last far too long.I'm glad this movie was released, if only to prompt its viewers to watch the clearly superior original.  At its heart, it's still a good tale that should at the very least get a strong reaction out of the audience. 7/10.",Vanilla Sky
399,Si_m007,"A great film, greatly misunderstood.",8,17 November 2008,"It is a good film, with many people being negative, and many more guessing wildly at its meaning. I think the film is complex, but less so than many people are suggesting.When DA signs up for the Lucid Dream, he chooses the point at which he begins the dream, and this occurs outside the nightclub. Before that part, there is no dream-sequence apart from a couple of short bits at the beginning.As for being cryogenically frozen - well, DA is frozen once he commits suicide. He does not go into the dream state when he is frozen. He has to wait until the technology is developed (this is stated in the film). Once the technology is developed to bring humans back from a frozen/dead state (re. the small dog on the TV) - DA can be brought back to life - but, crucially - he can either be brought to life and woken up, or he can go into a Lucid Dream of his choice (which he signed up for before committing suicide), which is what DA chooses to do - the start point of his dream being the scene outside of the nightclub.The problem is that there is a nightmare element to his dream, as he committed suicide and is convinced that he 'killed someone' - (himself) - but gets confused as he tries to figure out who he killed.The scenes with Kurt Russel where DA is wearing the mask is certainly part of his dream - he is self-analysing to try and find out what happened (which is haunting him).He makes the decision to wake up to the real world (which is 200 years since he was frozen - stated in the film by the Tech Guy), and jumps off the building in order to wake himself up from the Lucid Dream, which is the way he wanted to be woken up, and the way he chose to wake up when he signed up for the Lucid Dream (also stated in the film).This is a great film, and worth watching more than once (if not just to understand it) but is visually rich, and yes, Tom Cruise (of whom I am not a great fan) does act well - he is, as yet, no great master of the art, but executes a compelling performance. And yes, the music is spot on.",Vanilla Sky

402,Andy-Denotti,Vanilla sky or Abre los ojos : great Science Fiction Psychological Thriller,8,4 August 2006,"VANILLA SKYWhichever you chose to watch, the original ""Abre los ojos"" or the Hollywood remake ""Vanilla Sky"", this is a great Science Fiction Psychological Thriller and if you like this genre, the first time you watch it you'll often be on the edge of your seat with your eyes glued to the screen waiting for something unexpected to happen: and it will. Vanilla sky (2001) and Abre los ojos (1997).While most people rate the original ""Abre los Ojos"" as a being a better film than the American remake ""Vanilla Sky"", both movies have their pros and cons in spite of being nearly identical in the plot. Abre Los Ojos feels more natural, more realistic, and has that plain, gritty feel of many European movies. The characters feel more real, but the cinematography is also less spectacular than in Vanilla sky. Vanilla sky while containing plenty of drama and thriller elements, has also more space for humor and playful synergy between the characters. The overall feeling is that you are in a Hollywood fantasy. This lends a lightness to the movie that Abres los Ojos doesn't have. This is also a reason why people might like it less than the original: Abres Los Ojos sticks to the drama, to the story, and the interaction between actors is nearly always serious: the filmmaker wants you to believe this is actually all happening and it's no joke. The acting is in any case good in both movies. Whichever movie you chose to watch first is going to diminish the experience of watching the other version.

Tom Cruise en Penelope Cruz just aren't convincing in this movie.

Cameron Crowe's screenplay, direction and co-production (with Tom Cruise) brings a vision to the screen (and an aural arousal to the ears) not commonly found in today's filmscape...While based on a Spanish film `Abre Los Ojos', this work provides an enigmatic and interesting look at what we call life.  When one adds the possibility of ""life enhanced lucid dreams"" (I don't want to say any more...), albeit for a price, the openness of modern relation/friendships, and the premise of one's choice future (future choice?), this is a film to be watched more than twice.Complimented with great performances by actors well versed in the craft, Analog and digital selections of visual excellence, and a soundtrack that the ghost of Napster would love.

414,kari-lh,This movie makes no sense!,1,31 March 2012,At the end of this movie you just stand up from the couch really confused. It's not because you didn't get the plot it's just that it looks like the plot was written by a crazy man who didn't know the difference between reality and dreams.This movie starts out OK but gets more and more twisted the longer you watch it. This constant changing between reality and dream doesn't function very well when you never know which is what and it constantly changes so the reality isn't so real anymore. The whole concept of this plot is so far fetched that an ordinary mind can never buy it. Instead it makes you feel a little crazy when figuring out what it's about.It's not just the plot thats wrong but it's incredibly boring too. I fell asleep twice before I could finish it. It is 136 minuets but should be around 90 minuets since there's nothing important happening except a few things. I'm not saying I can't handle long movies because most of my favorites are 2-3 hours.The acting in this movie is not bad. Tom Cruise acts very well specially in the motional scenes. But it needs a bit more than a good acting to make this movie worth watching.Overall this is the worst movie I've ever seen. A lot of people I know fully agree with that statement. I find it strange to see that this movie is not on the bottom 250. Maybe it's just that the people around me have different opinions than most other people.

All I can say is if you've only seen it once you've missed a lot. Some have said that the film reveals something different every time they watch it. Is the ENTIRE FILM a dream or not?

I gave it a 7, which for me is already a good mark as I need a lot to be impressed by a movie.  Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise, both girls are quite good and so is Jason Lee.  It's not the type of movie you'll fall asleep in front of.  You have to like plots in which you get lost, confused - OK not as ""mental"" as Lynch would do but during the entire time you will be wondering : is he dreaming now or not ?  It also shows how weak guys can be, the main character just met what could be the love of his life and he's ready to (and in the end does) jeopardize everything for a last ""time"" with his ""sleeping buddy"".  Rather typical, maybe that's the morale of the story...  Also I'm not an expert in plastic surgery but you would think that - especially if money is no option - nowadays surgeons can do a pretty good job fixing people's face after an accident, no ?  The film also shows how in fact you can loose your mind taking painkillers and other medications, what is reality and what's not ?  And what's that snobbery about having only poster of French movies on the wall ?  And whatabout the ""empty Time Square"" scene ?  Isn't that just a gimmick used to make the media talk about the film during it's making - great publicity stunt isn't it ?!  But does it really bring something to the movie, or is it just another dream scene to make sure you're lost from the word go ? Another question this movie is asking is : in this superficial world we live in, could one still be in love with another after this person gets disfigured, could you still kiss that person ?  Is it ""ok"" to steal you best friend's new girlfriend ?

I haven't read that story so I can't verify this.As I reflect on Vanilla Sky, I realize that I should have been profoundly moved by this movie.  My thoughts could definitely be described as wistful. The problem however is that I did not feel that way while watching the movie.  I think the ending and explanations were so ""far out"" that it distracted me from the film's moral statement:  live a good life, savor every moment.  Life is beautiful and worth living in its own right.  Living is its own reward.The distraction caused by the ""gee whiz"" sci-fi ending nearly ruins the strongest moment of emotional poignancy.  This is Vanilla Sky's only flaw. For that reason I give it an 8 out of 10.  By the way, I'm an enormous fan of science fiction.

So, I just had to go see it the day it came out which was today! This movie is totally awesome and it really had me thinking and thinking and thinking.  So please allow me to go on a rant about the characters... David Aames or the nickname of the century Citizen Dildo... Tom Cruise... David is a very deep and interesting character, and is the main focus in the movie.  Cruise does a great job playing David.  **Somewhat Spoiler But nothing you probably havent all ready heard**  I thought after David got in the car accident with Julie and I saw how badly he was disfigured I thought I was gonna die!  The make up was awesome and Cruise really did do a awesome job as David. Sophia Serrano... Penelope Cruz...  Sopfia has a great attitude and is very willing to succeed.  She is very supportive of David when his face is disfigured.  A good person, in my opinion.  And, Tom and Penelope really do have a great on screen relationship, you can really tell they're in love.Julie Gianni... Cameron Diaz...  Wow, she's a real bad girl in this movie! What a b*tch and man do I mean it!!!!  Now, in my opinion I think that its great that David went for Sophia and not Julie because she is just too damn controlling over him!   Everyone will agree with me about it.  But, she does have some good songs on the sound track. McCabe...  Kurt Russel...  If you will he is a father figure for David a lot of the time, and Russel's performance at the end it very good and is totally awesome. Now for the story itself...  Well, if you like this I totally recommend Memento.  The story is complex and very deep.  And, truely had me thinking throughout the whole movie.  And, this is great this is what makes me love this movie...  They actually explain everything!!!!  Yes, at the end they explain everything and don't leave you hanging!!!!!   That's why its so great!!!! The set up is great, story complex, and strong.Now the sound track, is also very good and Paul McCartney's 'Vanilla Sky,' best song on the whole soundtrack.  Must buy! The thing that is very cool in VS is that the mood is very good, and actually Cameron Crowe {director} played music on the set to set the mood. It really showed. Now, this is the one thing that I thought was totally cool...  Was the theme of dreams...  This was really cool.  Because I have bad dreams a lot and I totally felt connected with David throughout the movie.  Okay I have been dubbed weird now.  But, they're are many themes in this wonderful movie.Okay now heres what I give the movie 10/10.  Once again Crowe and Cruise deliver a wonderful movie.

I then watched the ending again to maybe see if I missed something but, I didnt.  This film really made a mark on me that i don't know the signifigance of it.  The whole feeling of the film is still in me and I feel somehow, inspired.  Inspired in the sense that I felt refreshed and the need to go out and do something with my life.  There is is something much larger then all of us out there and a reason for us to live our lives voluntarily. I heard some people just cast down the film as confusing and they didnt understand it but, the fact is this movie isn't for everyone.  I feel you really have to appreciate the art of film making and stick with it until the end.  Although i did see some flaws with the movie overall, I was pleased with the outcome.",Vanilla Sky
424,hartmutw,"Wannabe clone of ""Eyes wide shut"" or ""Memento""",3,2 November 2004,"It became quite fashionable in recent years to make confusing movies, with many of them changing perspectives or moving back and forth in the story. That goes very well and adds to tension and atmosphere in well thought-through plots like Eyes wide shut or Memento.It goes terribly wrong though if director and producer basically do not know what they want to tell us and what the true message of a movie should be. All of this is the case in Vanilla Sky, which makes this movie a complete vase of time unless you enjoy the beautiful looks of Cruz / Diaz or Cruise.It could have been either a nice yet conventional or a true sci-fi movie but it wanted to be a little bit of everything. While you are struggling for more than 2 hours to keep up with all the changes in perspectives and perception, there is nothing you get in return. Quite a let down.",Vanilla Sky

And also he was the top of his career in those days......Also Brilliant soundtrack makes you go deeper in story... You just keep telling yourself what will it be the end of it? good,bad maybe evil... but in the end i found more of it.Year is near 2012 but believe me fantastically and literally there are a few movies can come closer to this. i love Kim Ki-Duk movies they are Korean you know ,,,with Vanilla Sky i felt the same WTF! effect...Enjoy...",Vanilla Sky

From the traditional hero gets bad guy to the psycho killer melodrama genre, i've probably seen it all.  After watching vanilla sky I would have to say it was one of the most original story lines i've ever seen.  Without giving anything away, i would have to say this was one of Tom C's best and most compelling performances.  For the first time he delves into a more versitile role than the american pop culture icon type roles he is widely known for.  in fact i would say that each cast member holds their own in tying the story together.  despite all these good characteristics i would also like to say that the movie does tend to eek along rather slowly into its climax.  But as a wiser man than myself once said, ""anything thats good is worth waiting for""  and this movie is no exception.  I would strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys ensightful movies with good plots.  All in all a complete winner.  8 out of 10",Vanilla Sky

429,burney-imdb,Not as good as the original,5,31 March 2007,"Vanilla Sky is a 2001 remake of the 1997 movie called Abre Los Ojos. I think that I didn't like this film as much as I could have because I had seen the original. This version had several main problems for me. To begin, this film added a lot of back story about the main character which just needlessly complicated the story. The original was very sharp in that respect. Additionally, this film didn't leave very much to the imagination, going into long expository at times that broke the fast-paced flow of the original. Finally, the music used in this film seemed to take center stage and some of it seemed very inappropriate for the tension of film. This isn't a bad film, but if you've seen the original before seeing this one, you may find it has many shortcomings.",Vanilla Sky

The setting was pretty promising: Rich womanizer with low-moral changing girls as often he changes his socks. SPOiLERS AHEAD Do not read any furtherif you haven't seen the film!! When Tom starts to have these problems the movie gets even more interesting. The movie gets weirder and weirder and you have to think to manage through it. I like movies where I have to think with my own brain and that the answers aren't offered to me on a silverplatter. It was rewarding to see that I was the only one in our group of five to understand the film as it moved forward. It was rewarding until that fatal moment where hollywood got in the picture. Until then 1hr.30min that is you had to think the story and the plot by yourself but after that they began to explain the movie to those who didn't understand. I mean, i like movies where there's room for my own thoughts and they aren't chewed ready for me. The rest 40minutes of the movie consisted nothing but dull detective work when the ""tech suppport"" explained things to tom. We understood it already and we should think these things with our friends nopt with the actors. What I mean is that it would have been much more better if we were allowed to our own explanations and translations. The movie should have ended when the red-haired woman bent over the desk. Now it's nothing more than 2hrs10mnts of readily chewed answers. My rate 4/10",Vanilla Sky

The story line, the performance, the soundtrack. everything inside is great, sweet and sour, never get out of my mind, and it's just so deep in me, I 've been watching this film at least 5 times. every time I watch this, the tastes never change, it's just so classic for me.

433,MovieMn1982,"A cinematic gem, and one of the best films of 2001!",10,11 May 2009,"This film is a thought provoking, intelligent, and all around amazing experience. It amazes me that this was given a mainstream release by Paramount, and I only wish that they would continue to take more risks like this once in a while, because here, the payoff is beautiful. Tom Cruise delivers one of his best performances to date as David Aames, an egotistical playboy who inherited a fortune from his father, and takes everything in his life for granted, until his life suddenly takes a turn for the bizarre. This film is about one man's journey to redemption through a series of dreams, scientific miracles, and the power of love.I personally believe that this is Cameron Crowe's best, after ALMOST FAMOUS. Why this film did not connect with audiences and critics is the most baffling thing for me to grasp. Cruise totally dives into this role (he also produced the film, which is based on a foreign film, ABRE LOS OJOS), and the rest of the supporting cast is perfect as well. Penelope Cruz will take your breath away with her fully realized performance as Sofia, Jason Lee is amazing as a heartbroken novelist, and Cameron Diaz gives what may be her best performance of all time as lonely, psychotic Juliana. The soundtrack is to die for, and perfectly compliments the mood of the film.This is a beautiful film. It is a celebration of life, and how ""every passing minute is a chance to turn it all around"". I watched this film in theatres years ago, and it made a huge impression on me. I've watched it twice since yesterday.For those of you who may be skeptical, ignore the negative reviews and watch the film for yourself. Let it wash over you. You won't regret it.",Vanilla Sky

Over the years I kept on coming back to this IMDb page to read people's reviews on this movie, the score started as low as 4.9 and came all the way up 6.8, i think once the blu ray comes out, in a few years it will go up some more. I have seen the original movie, and i have to say the low budget intrigue & minimalistic approach makes it a better film. Cameron Crowe put a killer mix tape over this and added some production value and it went from a sci fi indie to a melodrama. people savor it because they can relate to it, the bits and pieces of music and short quotes, like ""consequences"", ""every passing minute"", ""when we are both cats"", it's an effective movie because like Eternal Sunshine, this movie teases your emotions. so 6.8 really tells me a lot of more people are still out there with pain buried in their hearts, and that they have to live their lives with regret, and when they see this movie, their minds wonder about what could have happened.",Vanilla Sky

The big questions it asks about life, love, and consequences... the moment in the apartment when Cruise and Cruz fall for each other. Kurt Russell as the father-figure/psychiatrist... and the music. The music supervisor on this is a genius. Radiohead, Todd Rundgren... perfect choices. The sheer lunacy of the ""tech support!"" scene. I love movies that ask big questions, and this one might ask the biggest of all.

But this is a movie that needs to be seen more than once. With a repeat viewing when you are not caught up in the feeling of ""what is happening"" you can see the powerful message the movie is putting across. After watching 'Vanilla Sky' I rented the original Spanish version and I think it is unfair to compare the two because they are very different movies aiming for different end results. Cameron Crowe has taken the story of the original and made his own movie, and in my mind it works far better than any other attempts at crossing Sci-fi with a love story that I have seen (for example: 'Solaris' and 'The Butterfly effect'). It is definitely a movie that brings out strong reactions, you will love or hate it - and isn't that the best kind of movie?",Vanilla Sky

Everything in the movie, the storyline, the drama, acting, music makes every second absolutely enjoyable and wholesome.

I generally sit up and take notice!Unfortunately somewhere a little bit down the track it goes a bit astray - can't really pinpoint one exact scene or moment when it happens, but for some reason I started caring less and less what was going to happen.A big part of it is the heavy-handedness - it's over-long and certain scenes are dragged out to painful lengths. The music is pretty good (Radiohead's 'Everything In Its Right Place' is perfect for the opening scene) but overused - it seems that every minute there's another song playing. I know Crowe likes music but try to keep it subtle.The cast does a good enough job, but I think Cruise has it tough - he's just not convincing enough, he's kind of playing himself half the time, then hamming it up the rest of the time. Diaz, Cruz and Russell are OK, I like Lee but the part's not right for him. And Noah Taylor is almost the downfall of the entire film for me. He was just so stilted, but his character was so important to the last twenty minutes or so, he made me want to switch it off. Then again I was losing interest by then.Basically, there's more twists here than I can readily recall in any film - enough to keep you vaguely entertained for 136 minutes. But at the end I wondered whether it was really all worth it. I haven't seen the original but I imagine it's better, well at least more succinct at about 20 minutes shorter.It's certainly interesting, but ultimately long-winded and clunky...",Vanilla Sky

The movie was billed as a kind of stalker movie... but first of all, they never really created a stalker scenario with Cameron Diaz. The first thing you know, she's driving her car off a bridge into a wall. Throughout the movie, you can never tell what is reality or what is a dream... completely confusing. And I usually like movies that make you think (like Memento, a much better 2001 movie) Then, two thirds of the way through the movie it suddenly becomes this bizarre sci-fi non-thriller. I had no idea going into this movie that it was going to be that kind of film. And what a cop-out... it's like they didn't know how to tie it up, so EVERYTHING IS A DREAM.

I was almost forced to watch this and by the end i felt let down. the first 45 minutes or so were quite entertaining. i was actually watching what i felt was an above average film. i have no idea what happened after that. did mr Crowe get some geeky 15 year old to finish of the remainder of the film. it was just too outrageous to really get into what was happening and it has all been done before.the thousand or so twists were pure tripe, especially the last one. the scene in the elevator has to go down as one of the worst scenes in movie history. A credible director, a credible (arguably so) superstar, and a great Aussie talent in Noah Taylor managed to give us the biggest let down of an ending in movie history.after leaving the cinema i asked my friend how even the most feeble minded movie goer could enjoy a film like this. unfortunately he dropped afew names much to my dismay. did i miss something. if this movie isnt about a successful high flier who gets disfigured in a car crash and goes through all these stupid dreams only to find his mind has been programmed all along and discovers it 150 years later. please, spare me.im a big jason lee fan but how bad was his acting when he met mr cruise outside prison near the end of the film.this movie should be renamed ""OH NO MY BEAUTIFUL FACE!""PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Vanilla Sky

There is no flow, and the wierdness just piles up without any resonance or ""holy shit""-can't believe I saw that! quality----it's amazing how boring most of the movie is.  So basically, we have an overlong movie about a man (Cruise's worst performance to date) whose reality becomes more warped and his life unravels only to have it all explained with the GOOFIEST damn ending anyone has ever seen.

You can completely skip this movie and watch the original spanish version (Abre los ojos). I am not one of those people who always say that original version is better because sometimes I like remakes too but not in this case. If I had not seen the original version, i would have given 7 stars. For original version i would give 10 stars. Reasons: (1) Acting/cast fits perfect in spanish version. (2) 90% of dialogues have been adapted without modifying a bit - just sounds a little weird as they might fit in Spain but they should have americanized those while making remake. (3) Some parts have been modified/removed specially in the end which gives substance and thrill to the movie. (4) One crucial part of this movie to show the actor ugly (and even a little scary) - the spanish version gets 10/10 in that but the makeup team couldn't make Tom Cruise that ugly (unless he can't be made ugly). (5) Some funky and happy music have been incorporated in the movie (during serious scenes, why?) which is not the case in spanish version. Even with English subtitles, i would rate spanish version 10 and Vanilla sky 6. Don't waste time on American version if you like to enjoy a good thriller suspense sci-fi movie",Vanilla Sky

It had seemed like a whole lot more. I have to hand it to the movie, though, cause it does try to be all cryptic and philosophical like other ""artsy"" movies, but it is poorly executed. The whole thing comes off as some disastrous emotional roller-coaster, with the light, clear parts being slashed through suddenly and unexpectedly with the darker ""mystery"" parts. It's as if the movie is trying to play itself out with a normal linear plotline and only occasionaly decides to remind us that nope, it's actually an ""artsy"" movie and here, we'll prove that by being all depressing for a little bit...  I would literally have walked out if not for the fact that my ride was actually, for some reason, *enjoying* the movie. The last half hour almost, MAYBE redeemed it in my eyes, but it seems too added-on.  If the entire movie had been done with that lightly sci-fi flavor, then perhaps it would have worked.

The protagonist is rich, he is adored by many, confident about his looks. He goes through a very bad event in his life. For which he is partially responsible for. He then thinks that it was his mistake and how could have he avoided it ... But just big accident. Tom plays the character very nicely in two different phases of his life.

Since I missed the last 30 minutes of it (I fell asleep.), I ended up disliking it because it confused me.  Then I saw it a year later in its entirety by finally seeing the ending and realizing how everything ties up...I was fascinated.If I used one word to name the theme of this movie, I would use the word: CHOICES.  David makes choices in this movie that alter it from beginning to end within his real life and his lucid dreams.  In applying to my life, I would learn that we should always (that means AT EVERY MOMENT) make choices that help others, that do not smack of any self-service/self-ambition, and that benefit the good of others.

Diaz is excellently despicable, while Russell puts on a remarkably composed and competent performance for him.Great direction, cinematography and location work (an autumn NY looks just great) add a further dimension to a film that could already stand up on plot alone.I can see why this film created a divergence in opinion.

Who knows in the 21st century itself the lucid dream could become a reality for citizens of Earth. The movie is all about love, the hunger for power and how most people are living in a virtual reality. Very few know the difference between the real world and the illusion that exists.The movie can be described as an arty but if you don't subscribe to usual Hollywood clichés, then this one would stretch your imagination.I especially like the part of car crash, I thought the actors did a really good role because there was not much substance in it, she did not win any awards for it though.

Vanilla Sky is a mind-bending excursion across genres - a warped fairy tale that dabbles in romance, mythology, horror, mystery, and science fiction. There are plenty of philosophical musings on the difference between dreams and reality, and numerous occasions in which the film dares us to tell them apart.

Ok, Beaches had me almost there, but I honestly don't let films manipulate me into crying.This movie disturbed me.

It's nice to come to IMDB and read the other comments. It helps me come to terms with my feelings!And yes, I feel like I need to ""come to terms"" with them.
One comment said the dialogue was horrible. Hmm...recently I have criticized other films of the same thing. In this case, I didn't notice the dialogue as bad. Ok, I think back to Kurt Russell's role, and some of his lines weren't stallar. But, I wonder if the character was one-dimensional on purpose? Hmmmm.Another comment on this board said Mulholland Drive was better. Sorry, I didn't like Mulholland Drive. I thought it was a perverted, overly long ""Twilight Zone."" Ok, I ""got"" that movie, but still didn't like it. I ""get"" this one too, um, I think ;) After I saw Mulholland Drive, I wanted those 2 hours of my life back!!! I don't have the same feeling after watching Vanilla Sky.I definitely want to see the original (Spanish) version of this movie.",Vanilla Sky
457,Ed-217,A Great Movie Experience,9,27 December 2001,"Hey, I go to movies to be entertained.  For new experiences.  To temporarily escape from my current realty.  To stir up my emotions.  To be surprised. To be amazed.  To be challenged.BINGO!  This movie did it all.See it, you will like it.What a great cast of actors!  Great performances by all. Academy Award material in all categories...",Vanilla Sky
458,kbumbulis,Save it for rental,7,19 December 2001,"This is one of those movies that I wanted to like it more then I did.  Yet, I can't help but be disappointed.Let me start by saying that I don't understand anyone who praises Tom Cruise's performance.  Though there have been instances where Tom Cruise has occasional done well in a film, for the most part, he is an inconsistant actor who comes up short more often then not.  If he was considered so cute by the ladies in his youth, he would never be making movies today. Throughout this film, I laughed at the choices he made as an actor.  His character has this unconvincing, self-deprecating laugh that annoyed me because it sounded so contrived.  And when in doubt as to how to act in a scene, he seemed to default to this unconvincing smile.  Furthermore, I can't buy into the entire relationship between he and Penelope Cruz because it stretches credibility that she saw any charm in him.  (between all of the other fantastic things that happen which I CAN accept, that women were supposed to be seduced by him, is too far too stretch.  And I understand that he was supposed to be a rich, self-obsessed womanizer - but most womanizer's have a charming side that seduces their 'victims.'  I think the only reason we're supposed to believe that he was a womanizer is because they (1) its Tom Cruise and (2) the script says so.)  I saw the movie with a number of other people and not one person commented positively on his performance.The saving grace of the film is the idea of the movie.  (Which I won't go into detail and spoil it)  A friend of mine who saw it thought the movie was 'the biggest piece of trash put out this year' until the ending.  He thought it saved the movie.  But, any movie that bores and annoys an audience until the finale, isn't put together properly.  I think the movie would have been better served if more clues had been given to the audience for them to mull over until the ending.  (Though its possible on a second viewing, there may be more clues there, I can't imagine having the patience to sit through it again.)**Possible Spoiler Clue**  And though we both enjoyed the idea of the film, it was far from original having been done in other movies, most obviously, Total Recall.My biggest regret is not seeing the original, ""Abre Los Ojos"" first.  I'm not sure now whether to see it.I can see where the movie has potential for disagreement.  I only recommend that anyone who wants to see the film, save your $9 and rent it on video with a bunch of friends.",Vanilla Sky
459,gwbno1,"Liked the broad strokes, but thumbs down overall",4,25 December 2001,"Another ripoff of Sixth Sense, which was really a Jacobs Ladder ripoff. Trick ending.I am a really big Cameron Crowe fan, so I was really looking forward to this movie. He usually can get the most out of his actors. Even Tom Cruise was good in Jerry Maguire. And that's no easy feat!! But the dialogue in this movie really killed it for me. Cruise and Cruz never have a real conversation till the movie is nearing the end. Most of it is empty, vapid blather. ""I am an arms dealer"" ""Oh really"" or ""I would love to be this mole on your chest"" Just empty and vapid.Lots of Tom Cruise's teeth though. The usual smile.I understand the need for the mask, but it got really annoying after awhile. Some will say I'm an idiot for this one, but this probably could have been done without his disfigurement. I can hear all of your comments as fans of this movie will strongly disagree. But thats the way I feel.I just hope that Cameron Crowe will go back to his usual style of film making. Almost Famous gets better every time I see it. Singles and Say Anything are classics. To Cameron Crowe I say ""Go Back""",Vanilla Sky
460,psykomnky,Complete disappointment...,1,15 December 2001,"POSSIBLE SPOILER...Maybe my comment is a little unfair being that ""Abre los Ojos"" is one of my favorite films, but here it is.  I never knew how annoying Tom Cruise could be until I watched Vanilla Sky.  The title was completely ridiculous. They spent too much time on things that were not important to the story, especially in the beginning. It seemed as though it was redone for a stupid audience that wouldn't be able to figure out what was going on at the end unless there was huge clues throughout the film. The love story was overdone.  Cameron Diaz as Sophia was not done the way it was intended but I think it was a problem in direction not acting.  I really love Abre los Ojos and this movie was so long, boring and annoying (especially the soundtrack and Tom Cruise).   It should have ended 30 min before it actually did.

462,cpelle,Open Your Eyes,10,22 July 2003,"Director Cameron Crowe reunites with mega-star Tom Cruise from their 1996 collaboration of the romantic-comedy ""Jerry Maguire"" to give you 2001's most erotic, complex, and thrilling film that is surely one of the best films of the year.  This film is titled ""Vanilla Sky.""  Though difficult it is to know everything about the movie, it runs in the line of ""Memento"" and ""Mulholland Drive,"" the main questions it poses are these: How do we distinquish the difference between reality and dreams, what happens when they start colliding, do we hit the Vanilla Sky or go falling flat to the ground? The answers are harder to find than it might seem.  I have watched this film many times, and for starters, what you might want to do is run a list of every scene and then but a check if it is real of an x if it is a dream. But first let me back and inform those about the plot. David Amies (Mr. Cruise) is a wealthy tycoon living the American Dream he inherited from his father and having the perfect f*ck buddy in Julie Gianni, played by a ravishing Cameron Diaz in too-few of scenes.  At his thirty-third birthday party he falls in love, for what might be the first time, with Sophia, played by real-life sweetheart Penelope Cruz, who also turns in a sterling performance but was overrated by the critics, which gave less attention to the better of the two actresses. ""The saddest person to ever hold a martini,"" is how Sophia beautifully describes Julie.  David seems to agree when Sophia makes this comment, though you can see he is taken back.  It is not until the next day that he fully knows just how sad his f*ck buddy is, and obsessed too.  Julie stalkes David at the party, and apparently that night which he spends at Sophia's, because the next morning she pulls up in her teary blue-eyed car and takes him for a ride in which she confesses her true emotions for David, how she does not like to be known as his f*ck buddy, and then drives over a bridge, which apparently kills her and disfigures him.  Here the questions start beginning.  Was the car ride just a dream?  Is the beautiful, saint-like Sophia just a figment of David's imagination?  Though I did say earlier that Ms. Diaz was in too-few of scenes, Miss Giani does pop up again, in the most expected time and place, when David is either alone in his bed or sleeping with Sophia.  So are Sophia and Julie the same person, a symbol of David's misuse of women and his rambuscious tendancies? The questions I have just mentioned and a thousand more will pop up in your mind when watching this fascinating movie.  I could not take my eyes off it. I didn't close them once.

467,GuitarGod75,Brilliant and Beautiful,10,13 October 2002,"I'm not sure why it took me so long to get around to seeing this film, because I did enjoy Cameron Crowe's previous films, especially Almost Famous, a film that was created back to back with this one.
I expected that this would be a great film, because Cameron has a great sense of beauty in his portrayal of human emotions, but i had no idea of the depth of his ideals of love, emotion, consiquence, etc.This film works on so many levels.  It is a psychological thriller, science fiction, drama, etc.  Every moment you think you have figured it out, it's compleatly different than what you expected.  Plus, this is another film where cameron's uncanny ability to convey an emotion shines through, with the help of some great acting.Beyond its content depth, it has spectacular visuals.  The whole film has a David Lynch-like dream quality to it.  His immense love of music also shows.  His blending of Nancy Wilson's (his wife/ ex heart guitarist) compositions and the intense visuals flow together beautifully.For me, the best thing about the movie is how it draws you in.  You compleatly forget about your own life because you are so overwhelmed with his.  When it ended, i was amazed at the fact that i was still sitting in my apartment.  Anyway.....wether or not you agree with Cameron's views on life, love, etc is beside the point.  I think it is a man trying to share his views and ideals, and leave them for you to think about, he's not trying to push anything on you, and i think the film is worth seeing for all these reasons.",Vanilla Sky

The acting was great, the soundtrack acceptable, and the editing and camera angles were used magnificently. The only parts I didn't like was when David Aames was talking with McKay.I liked the ending. The effects were good. Some people are complaining about the ending, saying ""It explains nothing!"" or, ""Oh, is Sofia really Julie?"". It's ALL explained in the elevator scene, where they ride up to David's true moment of choice.The soundtrack was decent. I liked the songs by Sigur Ros on there. They fit the movie well... but some of the songs on their were eccentric and weird. The music in the end scene fit perfectly as David has his final conversation with Sofia before taking a literal leap of faith.Penelope Cruz, Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz (along with many other cast members) did a fantastic job in this film. Tom portrayed a character who was afraid of heights well, he portrayed a drunk man well... and so on. Overall, I think Vanilla Sky is a pretty decent movie. Good enough to put under a Christmas tree.

It an amazingly interesting movie for the time it was released and may have been the first to inspire todays cross genre/time travel type movies that are a staple in every movie today. I remember watching this in the movie theater and was blown away. And had the DVD being blown away every time.Tom Cruise gives a great performance, Penélope Cruz was at her best in this, Cameron Diaz almost shatters her career as becoming the ultimate scorned woman.

470,jimmylace-62819,Vanilla Sky explained,10,31 July 2020,"A perfect romance descends into a mind-bending, Lynchian nightmare. A tragic, yet touching sci-fi romance about a man who must overcome his deep-rooted fears of intimacy.The plot is a fantasy within a fantasy; a love story as dreamt by a fearful-avoidant. An emotionally-detached man who is figuratively, and quite literally, frozen.As such, the love story that unfolds is blurred between reality, and the subconscious embellishments of the hero; their desires/fears and distancing strategies.The hero David, suffered from profound esteem issues thanks to an emotionally-unavailable, overbearing father. His worst fear was to be rejected for who he truly was, and so he spent his time hiding behind a mask of apparent high self-esteem. A charming, wealthy, good-looking man with everything...aside from that which matters most.Julia, a jealous, ex- lover forcibly removed David's protections by driving them both off a bridge, killing herself, and leaving him badly disfigured in the process.Following the accident, Sofia abandons David for his best friend. His traumatised psyche and disfigurement is too much for her to deal with. Sofia is a mere mortal.The most tragic note of the story comes as David gives up all hope at this point, and chooses to be cryogenically frozen.Avoidants have many distancing strategies; particularly unrealistic expectations of others. It's no surprise David chooses to dream of an endless, honeymoon-phase romance with Sofia. No conflicts. Just good times with a perfect woman.His subconscious ultimately rebels, and his desire to wake up to the reality of true love soon grows. And of course, that requires a leap of faith.""The sweet ain't as sweet without the sour.Vanilla Sky underappreciated. It's truly rich in its construction and symbolism. For example, it's no accident that David is fascinated by Benny The Re-animated Dog. Afterall, that's a promise of loyal companionship forever.Avoidants spend much of their time in isolation, retreating into fantasy in order to generate emotional self-reliance.",Vanilla Sky
471,delo,Impressionist Filmmaking--Nicely Done!,10,21 January 2002,"It does seem like this film is polarizing us.  You either love it or hate it.  I loved it.I agree with the comment(s) that said, you just gotta ""feel"" this one.
Also, early in the film, Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend a painting done by Monet--an impressionist painter.  Monet's style is to paint in little dabs so up close the painting looks like a mess, but from a distance, you can tell what the subject is.  Cruise mentions that the painting has a ""vanilla sky"".  I believe this is a hint to the moviegoer.  This movie is like that impressionist painting.  It's impressionist filmmaking!  And it's no coincidence that the title of the movie refers to that painting.This is not your typical linear plot.  It requires more thought.  There is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and no, you're not always going to be sure what's going on. But at the end, all is explained.
You will need to concentrate on this movie but I think people are making the mistake of concentrating way too hard on it.  After it ends is when you should think about it.  If you try to figure it out as it's unfolding, you will overwhelm yourself.  Just let it happen...""go"" with it...keep an open mind.  Remember what you see and save the analysis for later.I found all the performances top notch and thought it to be tremendously unique, wildly creative, and spellbinding.But I will not critize the intelligence of those of you who didn't enjoy it. It appeals to a certain taste.  If you like existential, psychedelic, philosophical, thought-provoking, challenging, spiritual movies, then see it.  If you prefer something a little lighter, then skip it.

472,torrboy,Fairly good film that is let down by the last half hour.,7,19 December 2001,"""Vanilla Sky"" could have been a great film, but the unnecessary and overly long ending softens the impact and leaves one feeling somewhat disappointed. The first two thirds of the film are very well done, with some excellent shots (eg, the deserted New York city streets), and the viewer is left guessing at every turn: is this a dream, or is this reality? Is this the past, the present, or the future? Was it a setup, or did he really do it? The movie is enthralling and there are many details to keep the viewer's mind focused on the unraveling story, although by the end of the film you realise none of them really mattered.At the ""end"" of the film, all the pieces fall into place as the main character (and hopefully the audience) realises what's been going on, and had the film ended at this point, it would have been one of those chilling endings like ""The Sixth Sense."" The viewer has enough information to make sense of the film, but nothing is really explained in detail; viewers could have a wonderful time exploring the many possible explanations of the film. (For those who have seen the film, this is the scene where Tom spots the television commercial and starts banging on the glass in the cell).Unfortunately, once Tom has figured it all out, the audience is subjected to a long, drawn-out explanation of what has happened (just in case they hadn't figured it out yet), and the film explains everything in agonising detail, which destroys all the fun! No longer can you ponder whether such-and-such a scene was real or a dream, because it's all laid out in black and white. Ending the movie on an optimistic note also seemed against the grain of the film; it's been dark all the way through, so why change directions now?Others have compared this movie to Mulholland Drive, which I feel is a much better movie, despite (and because of) the fact that it is totally incomprehensible to me. It seems like ""Vanilla Sky"" is trying hard to be an artsy, intellectual movie, yet at the same time it tries to cater to the ""big dumb action movie"" crowds. This backfires as the ""artsy"" crowd will feel patronised whilst the ""popcorn movie"" fans won't be seeing this film anyway.All in all, an interesting film that is worth seeing for the first two thirds, but you can definitely wait for the video / DVD release.",Vanilla Sky

I feel that this was the biggest disappointment for the film. I thought it was going to have some great meaning to it, but instead I was let down by ""Hey, let's just make him frozen and in a lucid dream."" I would NOT RECOMMEND seeing this movie.

The entire, endless last forty minutes is spent explaining the rest of it, but in a way that's neither interesting nor satisfying.

477,j1977,An awful remake of an awful movie. Cameron Crowe should be ashamed of himself.,2,28 December 2001,"Well, where do I start? Okay, for starters, how about that the original film ""Open Your Eyes"" by Alejandro Amenabar was an extremely pretentious, poorly shot, and deliberately confusing (even to the director himself) art film.  Now, I have nothing against art films, if there made with style and that style is backed up with substance.  But ""Open Your Eyes""  tries to be all of that, and fails by trying to be clever.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Penelope Cruz is in both films. But this review is not about ""Open Your Eyes."" Cameron Crowe had just won on oscar for what I felt was the best film of 2000, ""Almost Famous.""  His other films, ""Say Anything"" ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (which he scripted, but didn't direct), ""Jerry Maguire"", and ""Singles""  are all very intelligent, witty films about dating and growing up.  So, now Crowe decides to move out of the genre which he knows so well and make an art film.  Fine, Paul Thomas Anderson did it with ""Magnolia"" and did a bang up job.  So with that, I'll tell you that I was looking forward immensely to Vanilla Sky (I watched ""Open Your Eyes"" after ""Vanilla Sky"").My high expectations were dashed to pieces with this incomprehensible plot and blatant symbolism which doesn't really make sense.The story (if you can call it that) involves Tom Cruise as a vain daddy's boy, whose parents die, he inherents their thriving company and he basically makes a living making an ass out of himself.  He's sleeping with Cameron Diaz, ditches her for Penelope Cruz (who after this and Captain Corelli's Mandolin, should be deported), and then wonders why Diaz drives them both off the road in a spectacularly silly slow-motion car wreck.  The rest of the film has Cruise (now disfigured) trying to win back Cruz ... Then everything is summed up nicely at the end in an elaborate denouement which Crowe (or Amenabar) pulls out of his ass.I'm not really sure who's to blame for this crap, Crowe, Amenabar, or Cruise for convincing Crowe to remake the film.It's themes could have made a good movie.  It has shades of better films (""Waking Life"", ""Dark City"", Cruise's own ""Eyes Wide Shut"") but instead it takes all of its ideas and intentions and makes... no sense at all.Cameron Crowe, please make another coming of age movie!

479,bradshaw-pm,A happily confusing lark,7,5 July 2006,"Vanilla Sky is either a disappointment when viewed against Indie Film standards, or a happily confusing lark when compared to the unending deluge of big budget / low-minded Hollywood that's released weekly.On the plus side, we find a movie that engages the viewer and the mind. A movie that is certainly confusing at first sitting, it is that rare commodity: the movie we like to talk about later. Like Memento or Barton Fink, people will find themselves dissecting the minutiae of the film after it's over.Also impressive is the fact that Tom Cruise, one of Hollywood's famed pretty boys, spends at least two-thirds of the film either hidden under a mask, or horribly disfigured. Not a role many other actors would jump to take.On the down side, Vanilla Sky, (a re-make ?) is basically an Art House or Indie film starring a big Hollywood actor. What could have been an interesting view on the hidden nature of man, or alternate/multiple realities, or even a study on the nature of reality itself, instead ends up like an art house rip-off of Total Recall.Rating: B- / C+FYI: 1) When did the universe change so much that ""Banky"" from Chasing Amy could get a lead role playing opposite Tom Cruise? 2) When did Penelope Cruz get the role of Indecipherable Speaker, ala Brad Pitt in Snatch or Fenster in The Usual Suspects? 3) When did Paul McCartney last have a decent single?

American Psycho(especially in the book) was able to achieve this as well. FightClub had one failing: every aspect about this warped reality twistwas revealed and in so doing the audience was treated like achild. Vanilla Sky, like Fight Club, destroys a reasonably goodconcept film by demystifying the story. The first words in the dialogue  Open Your Eyes' spoken bySophia (Penelope Cruz) in the first instance are a link to theoriginal movie and, in the second instance a clue to unravellingthe twist. With these soft words we are awoken to the extravagances of David Aames' life. Aames (Tom Cruise) is filthyrich, handsome and charming; his life seems like a dream to therest of us proletariat. Aames is having what he believes is acasual affair with Julie (Cameron Diaz) but he falls, immediately,in love with Sophia at his own party. Heart broken and desperateJulie commits suicide by driving her car over a bridge with Aamesinside of it. Consequently, Aames is disfigured and almost losesthe three things that made his life a dream: his good looks, thecompany left to him by his father and the woman he loves.
Miraculously, his dream life returns: his face is reconstructed; heretains ownership of his company and; Sophia loves him not forhis looks but for who he really is. However, his life once againbecomes a surreal nightmare when the dead Julie seems to bealive and acting as Sophia  did that sentence make sense?   
This story is told from the point of view of Aames in a prison cellwho is accused of murder. To prepare a defence he tells his storyto a psychiatrist who finally forces Aames to remember theincident where he murders Sophia when he thought she wasJulie. Is that the end? Of course its not. Aames also remembers afreaky incident in a bar where a dorky guy in a suit convinces himthat he is some sort of God. No no he is not a God but only in adream induced by cryogenics. That's right, he killed himself afterwas disfigured and began a dream while cryogenically frozen.Yawn. (I just reread what I just wrote and it sounds really silly. Waita minute maybe it's not my writing but the movie itself.)Okay, so the plot is disappointing. However Cameron Crowe isundoubtedly a talented director who proved his worth with hisprevious film Almost Famous. One scene in Vanilla Sky demonstrates his talent. The nightclub scene showed his talentwith lighting and camera work. It also showed his talent withactors which is poignantly demonstrated by the extremelyawkward moment where a drunk Aames, in a desperate move torenew their relationship, forces Sophia to reminisce their firstflirtatious encounter. Lastly, and most importantly, this scenedemonstrates his knowledge and awareness of music as anecessary tool to convey the emotions of the characters to theaudience. There are few directors who use music as effectively asCrowe. Throughout this movie he uses the music to not onlyconvey the emotions but also to mock them, which is reminiscentof the great Kubrick.In the end this is a hard move to judge because you have atalented director and a mildly interesting story but ruined by a poorending. 6/10  6 for Crowe's performance.",Vanilla Sky

Having left the theatre three times during the movie because it was just /that/ bad (and only having come back because I couldn't drive away), I readily agree.Its very hard to comment on this movie, simply because it was so insane. Now, granted, ""insane"" is not something I automatically dismiss, (usually because what others cannot perceive often makes sense to me) but this was just... dumb. Disjointed, the feel of the movie isn't consistent. Yeah, maybe that is good in some cases, but not in this one.Disturbing parts of the movie are treated with sickening lights of humor. Parts of it feel like horror before being twisted to a Disney feel, which is just... yuck.This movie is about as 'intellectual' as modern art. Avoid.",Vanilla Sky

Only Eurotrash who sit in Grenich village drinking thier cafe lattes and smoking will appreciate this piece of garbage.I must admit the trailor was great. It made me go see the movie. I was sucker punched.  How bad is the movie if the only Golden globe nomination went to Cameron Diaz who is in the movie for like 10 minutes.Jason Lee should stick with Kevin Smith movies. This movie wasn't half as entertaning as Jay and Silent Bob.Vanila Sky, the Majestic, Ali, all have Oscar Buzz and all stunk.  Oscar lost all of its credability after rewarding Chariots of Fire with Best picture and giving Ghandi best costume design, they wore sheets.

Tom Cruise is SO GOOD in each of the essentially three different roles he plays in this movie.  He is so charismatic and believable that everyone else is truly relegated to co-starring roles.  The movie has the same type of surreal quality as a David Lynch film, but happily, Cameron Crowe doesn't leave you pondering what the heck is going on by the time the film ends. Never would have thought I would have said it, but this is a MUST see, Cruise is terrific!  Colorful, imaginative, interesting, confusing, and all nicely wrapped up at the end.  Absolutely loved it.",Vanilla Sky
488,TotenRot,A sixth emotion: Boredom,3,20 December 2004,"At one point in this film the main character is told that there are five basic emotions: guilt, hate, shame, revenge and love. My immediate response was, what about anger and fear? I think this serves as a good illustration of this movie as a whole. It tries to appear intelligent, but it just isn't.This movie asks some basic existential questions. For that purpose it tells a confusing story where the main character is led to question reality, his sanity, what's important in his life, friendship, love and all the usual clichés. And the answers are mostly the usual dogmas we all know by heart; Friendship and love is more important than money and good looks. D'oh!This lightweight philosophical theme is set against a confusing story that doesn't have any real progress or goal. We just get to watch the main character get more and more confused, and his reality is failing more and more. Until the end, when we get the conclusion in a way that's just as imaginative as explaining all the unanswered questions of reality with something supernatural, such as God.I suspect this movie will cater very well to intellectuals who love to analyze movies. There are plenty of metaphors here to dig into. The problem, however, is that they are not really interesting since the questions asked are, as stated earlier, mostly the usual clichés, and the answers are the usual dogmas. In my opinion this leaves no real reason to try to analyze this story, except for the mental exercise of analyzing and satisfying ones own intellectual ego through the process. That can of course be fruitful and interesting in itself. But it doesn't make an exciting movie.To sum up, the problem with this movie is that the story is uninteresting and boring, and with an unimaginative conclusion. The questions raised are clichés, and the answers are dogmas. Good for those who like to analyze movies, boring for the rest of us. I give this film 3/10.",Vanilla Sky
489,ytseprog,one of my favorite movies of recent times...(longish),10,22 August 2002,"I went to see this movie in the theaters expecting a watered down version of Abre los Ojos, little did I know that Cameron Crowe was going to take his version, and inject so much life and humanity into it! To say I was pleasantly surprised is the understatement of the year! I plainly fell in LOVE with this movie, even more when it was finally released on DVD, and I got to see Crowe's commentary and just hear him express all the things unsaid in the actual feature.I am a big fan of audio commentaries, specially by directors who LOVE their craft. Cameron Crowe is one of those directors. The audio commentaries for Almost Famous and Vanilla Sky are amongst the best ive ever had the pleasure of listening in to.Cameron Crowe has said in interviews that Alejandro's take on both movies was this :  He thought the movie was like two brothers: one that was into opera and one that was into rock n roll. That was my dream that you could watch both movies and see some similarities and see that we took some different paths too.People tend to get mad because the movie gives away the whole plot device in the end, but those who do, arent really ""getting"" what the movie is *really* about. The Sci-fi plot devices in the movie are really just a means to an end, the *real* meat and potatos of the movie's message is within the relationship of David and Sofia, and in my opinion, this was much better developed (as were most of the characters) in Vanilla Sky than in Abre..., where the characters felt a bit one dimensioned, at least compared to their counterparts in Vanilla Sky. (specially the best friend character, which Jason Lee played to perfection, that character was pretty much one dimensional in Abre...)
To put a wrap to it: If you saw this movie and hated it, see it again, try with an open mind. If you enjoyed it, see it again with the Director's comentary on, its WELL worth it!",Vanilla Sky

I've read a few of the other comments, and although I pity those who did not understand it, I do agree with some of the criticisms. Which, in a strange way, makes me like this movie all the more. I accept that they have got a pretty cast to remake an intelligent movie for the general public, yet it has so many levels and is still great to watch. I also love the movies, such as this one, which provoke so many debates, theories, possible endings and hidden subtext. Congratulations Mr.Crowe, definitely in my Top Ten.P.S.

Is this also the Mustang he drove in Steven Spielberg's ""War of the World""? Wow! What a coincidence. Kurt Russell's role could have gone to Nick Nolte or Kris Kristofferson. By the way - was that Steven Spielberg who hugged Cruise and called him a SOB during the party scene?? I was lulled to sleep during some sequences in the movie as the plot became abruptly disconnected and the characters seemed lost or preoccupied with some irrelevant chatter. Penelope Cruz seemed like a distraction for the Cruise character. I could understand how he fell in love with her during the shoot.",Vanilla Sky
492,benjamin-reed-326-811483,Strange but brilliant film,9,28 March 2012,"This is one of the greatest movies of all time. But what do you expect when you team up the greatest actor (Tom Cruise) of his generation with one of the greatest storyteller of the last 10 years (Cameron Crowe)? Furthermore, every actor in this film brings their A-game. Aside from the top shelf story, it's the actors that enable this film to stand apart from the rest of 2001-2. Cameron Diaz practically re-invents the desperate woman persona and Penelope Cruz shines as love at its most innocent. Kurt Russell once again gives such a splendid performance that you forget ""Tango and Cash,"" ""Soldier,"" and ""Overboard."" He is sensitive yet demanding all at once. And towards the end of the film, he nails what should have been an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor (or at least a Golden Globe) when he switches roles with Cruise. Once confident in himself, his life, and his profession, he becomes vulnerable, scared, and angry at what his life might actually be. Jason Lee stars in perhaps the weakest of roles, however, he gives it his all. Given some of the movie's cornier lines, he delivers them as if it's Shakespeare In the Park. He is truly an actor's actor. And Cruise? He's brilliant as usual.******* POSSIBLE SPOILER********** His performance reminds me of something Roger Ebert said about the film ""Birdy,"" starring Matthew Modine and Nicholas Cage. He admired the skill of both actors because they had to give up what were then their most important assets as actors: Modine his personality and Cage his... I can't tell you the latter or I'd give away the movie. However, if you are familiar with Roger Ebert or ""Birdy"" you may have guessed it. But the point is, Cruise must give up both of the assets to express the confusion and anger of David Aames. This film is a treat, and anyone who watches it will surely want to see it 20 more times.",Vanilla Sky
493,imapoa,Surrealistic mental exercise--not for the casual viewer,8,13 December 2004,"David Aames (Tom Cruise) is a wealthy publisher who suddenly has the props kicked out...of a world he thrived in. Eventually all seems well again, until a nightmare worse than before takes over.Cruise and company are at work in a complicated, time-shifting, special effects, symbolic filmmaker's world. This movie probably won't work as a late show feature just before dozing off. It has to be watched attentively, and more than once. It contains clues about Aames and his situation but can be viewed without looking for those--the viewer has to pay attention nonetheless! I quickly developed an affinity for Vanilla Sky which was in production during my surgeries for a congenital brain aneurysm. Aames is acrophobic and scarred, although much more severely than me. In his Lucid Dream, he interacts with a girl he barely knew in real life. His is named Sophia, mine is Janet. He is unknowingly in a dream state for 150 years, for me it was only a couple of weeks.

When it came out, the previews were less than inspiring, so I avoided it - I didn't want to see CC blow it. Later a friend with Good Taste told me it was pretty good, but I just forgot about it.I'd like to compare it to another movie I've seen recently to point out some of the things that VS does right where this other, allegedly classic film completely floundered, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone. I will say that while Tom Cat Cruise wasn't his usual flamboyant self in this one, I like him as an actor - even if he is an ass in life. I'll also say that the film is intriguing at the beginning and lulls toward what seems to be the conclusion. Then, just as I began to give up on it, the movie found its feet for a interesting twist in the final minutes.There's a line very near the ending in which Cruise's character is told that he was careless with someone and it resonates - that's exactly the linchpin of the entire movie, distilled into a single sentence.As in movies, so it is in life, sometimes. A moment's carelessness can destroy one's entire life, yet it's impossible to be perfect, isn't it?",Vanilla Sky
495,indianmansteamer,Tom Cruise _IS_ the Amercan Alain Delon,4,8 June 2005,"An interesting film that portrays the struggles of the idealistic young Mr. Cruise, who is challenged to employ his idealism in the service of the Japanese war effort in WW II. A key aspect of this struggle is the protagonist's struggle within himself. Tom Cruise, the young man, seeks to humanize the brutal conditions at a mining operation in Manchester. Further complicating matters is the profound sense of national prejudice that shapes the relationships between the various characters. To the workers & Welsh prisoners, regardless of his professed ideals, Cruise is America and therefore an oppressor. Although Cruise tries to win their trust, his own frustration enables him to strike a young Welsh helper, reinforcing the image of the brutal America. This weakness is a key underlying theme. Even late in the film, when he takes a very brave stand against some executions, his effort is a bit late and his stand is successful only when the Welsh prisoners take up the protest. He struggles because her fears he cannot live up to the ideals he expresses.Cruise is also confronted with the another irony. Although he opposes the war, he has chosen a route of avoidance rather than resistance. This is emphasized early in the film during an evening with a friend (Penelopy Cruise) who is about to be inducted. She comments that, although they opposed the war, neither of them was brave enough to face the penalty for resistance of life imprisonment. Shortly thereafter, he takes the mine job to get a military exemption. Yet, if he is successful, the production improvements in the mine only fuel the American War Machine.A valuable film because it explores areas of the Penelope's bodice(Although smaller in size than, say, Christina Applegate's twin patronizers). Also an interesting observation in the danger of half-measures when taking a moral stance. Cruise is ultimately confronted with the fact that you cannot avoid the war, only oppose it or aid it. I look forward to viewing the next film.",Vanilla Sky

Cameroon Crowe always stimulates your imagination and gets you feeling warm and fuzzy inside.  That doesn't change here.  Infact this is his most mature film yet.

498,Miz Muzik,Open Your Wallet,3,16 December 2001,"I can't help but feel bothered by the fact that I spent 9 dollars watching Tom Cruise run around Times Square trying to look confused. VANILLA SKY starts off as a real nail biter, that is until Tom Cruise stops acting like Tom Cruise and becomes Paranoid-Tom-Crazy-Cruise. No matter how hard he tries, Cruise just isn't taken seriously outside of a witty romance. And once again, will someone please drag Penelope Cruz into the street and riddle her with bullets? Yes, she has a pretty smile and I'm sure Tom and she make a snazzy couple, but the poor girl can't act. However, Jason Lee does it again, delivering a great supporting role without so much as breaking a sweat. Cameron Diaz is deliciously evil, though her part grows old toward the end of the film. VANILLA SKY desperately needed another hour on the cutting board, deleting some of the nonsense that just adds to the complete confusion of the audience. Now, I'm not saying I don't like confusion. I loved FIGHT CLUB, THE SIXTH SENSE, THE MATRIX, and any other movie that might be labeled as a psychological thriller. But Cameron Crowe's cast seems lost in the film, not sure if this is a surreal romance or a sci-fi horror flick or what. Without ruining the ridiculous ""plot twist"" (an embarrassing deus ex machina), it is difficult to elaborate on the shamefully low point of VANILLA SKY.

The only scene that made me smile was after Tom leaves Penelope's apartment and she pounds her fist on her couch and shakes her head; you could feel her excitement.  Every other moment was a miscalculation.  The dialogue was too cute, the scene in the underground club was pointless, plot twists are never fully explained by the fifteen minute coda (who, exactly, did Tom kill, and how does his subconscious play into it?) Crowe tries to attach a message to this movie -- that Tom's character takes his models for human interactions from pop culture.  This message is too crudely put.I was barely into the movie when Tilda Swinton showed up and then it totally derailed for me.  Really, cryogenics?!?!?!Crowe should have just made a straight romance which explores the various themes of vanity, love, obsession, and disappointment that this rubic's cube of a plot failed to properly convey.",Vanilla Sky

This movie creates a futuristic ideal for the non-believer: you will not surely die. That was the exact lie Satan told Adam and Eve in the garden and people still believe this in the 21st century. This movie underrates our precious lives on earth. The story telling is persuasive but don't let it get to you.

The writing could have been a little better in some places. Some parts were a little boring. And I think the idea/twist could have been communicated/set up a little better, given the potential of the idea/twist.If you like sci-fi, thrillers, tom, alternative styles, new ideas... then this movie is worth your watching. But be warned, some people I know found it too confusing. You know those people.Good stuff. 8 out of 10",Vanilla Sky
516,bsl41,Brilliant Philosophical Film,10,6 June 2002,Though completely different from other Cameron Crowe movies Vanilla Sky is not only an emotional high but a brilliant philosophical movie which intelligently uses clues to reveal its messages.

517,guitarjoa,"An underestimated, fantastic, intelligent movie!",8,4 August 2002,"I'm sorry if my english fails sometimes, I'm dutch so forgive me.... Why do I find this movie at the romantic comedy's in my local video shop? Is it because of its cover that looks so 'romantic'? Well, don't let the cover fool you. This movie is really one to watch, especially when you are into movies with a sort of mystery in it. And the plot stays hidden very well, during the movie. Its a surprise! Don't get frustrated by all the strange things that happen on the screen of your telly, in the end they explain it all. I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, actually I don't rate him very high for his acting skills. But in this movie, well, guy, this is good. He is fully believable in this role! You really did a great job, Tom! Lets not forget about Cameron Diaz and the lovely Penelope Cruz for their part in this movie, they make it all much more than just another romantic movie.Well everybody, as you can see I recommend this movie very highly, and I think you do as well. Go get it!",Vanilla Sky
518,guitarjoa,This is the trip,8,28 August 2003,"Vanilla Sky really blew my head off when I first saw it. If you've seen the cover/poster you'll know what I mean when I tell you I started looking with the idea this was a sort of romantic comedy or something. In the beginning, this seems to be pretty accurate: romantic, oh yeah! You can feel the tension between the Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz... great. The viewer is expected to fall in love with her, and you really do (If I was a woman I'd fancy Tom, I guess)...well, something like that, you know. What happens after the carcrash, when David Aames life takes a turn he looses control over, is unbelievable after the quite romantic start! But its definately GREAT! This way you can really feel the characters... its not just some folks in a strange situation, they come alive...more. Great acting, great story, great REMAKE! It's a remake of 'Abre Les Ojos' ('open your eyes', you'll get along this phrase quite a lot of times watching the movie, so be prepared, for what that might mean...I don't know). Abre Los Ojos, I really want to see it, but they don't have 'm in my local video-rent-thing (I don't know how ya english speeking people call it, pretty clear i think), so too bad, can't compare stuff. But this was awesome, second time watching was even better; you know the deal but it's still an intriguing story. So go see it and if you've seen it: see it again. 9/10",Vanilla Sky

I am happy I did. Maybe it is because I never saw Abre Los Ojos, but I thought this version was great. And I am not even a fan of Tom Cruise. I was confused to the end (and perhaps even after) but hey that was half the fun. A vast improvement over the usual fare where you can predict what is going to happen 20 minutes into the plot.",Vanilla Sky

521,rezaul_nsu,"The ending, that is bitterly unpredictable, could be better!",7,8 March 2010,"Just 15 minutes ago, I watched this movie. Before finishing it, I was totally submersed under dreams and puzzles. It was creating puzzles one after another.Indeed, the movie is very emotional and romantic. It has a very good story that has been presented beautifully. During the last half an hour of this film, it seemed to me that nothing can be better than this; while I was expecting a consistently good ending. But, the finishing could not satisfy me, as I desired more-actually, this film was creating desire. But, some people might like the ending too! I personally, do not like to see science-fiction to solve a puzzle because the movie was emotionally romantic, and bringing science-fiction(that seems to me against emotion) into it destroys the flow.Except the ending, I love every thing of this movie. I recommend everyone to watch it. If I am asked what the most influential genre of this movie, I will tell 'romantic'. So, if you want to fell romantic emotion, don't miss it.",Vanilla Sky
522,vegansXe,"OK, I get it.",2,2 July 2006,"It's as though the screenwriter found the term Deus Ex Machina in a film-making for dummies book and decided that 2 hours and 20 minutes of ""Oh, it was a dream"" scenes was a good idea. I seem to be one of only a few people who found the ending predictable, trite, and most of all, irritatingly unresolved. Forgive me if I want something that does more than negate the last two hours of the film, or at least something more than just another waking up from a dream to get out of the fact that everything happening in the movie is ridiculous. Why this movie is bad:1) 80% of it, we find out in a predictable ending, is a dream.2) I hate David Lynch, that's not really related, but in all fairness, if he had directed the movie, I would have just avoided it, and been better off.3) The acting ranges from bad (Cruz, Diaz, and largely Cruise), to mediocre. I like Jason Lee, but there's no way he could salvage this.4) The incredibly boring stretches between anything happening. It's like a Steven King novel in it's lack of events at times.5) The ending (as previously mentioned) negates the majority of the movie, is a cop out, and is just plain stupid. A good twist can be fantastic, a bad one, as is the case, can make me actually write a review out of pure spite.In summation, don't watch it, or if you already have, tell other's not to.",Vanilla Sky
523,monk_venkman,Open Your Eyes,9,24 March 2004,"Vanilla Sky is a 2001 remake of the great 1997 movie, Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). And in my opinion, a much more human and emotional version. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a selfish egomaniac who takes other people's emotions for granted, and thinks only of himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, David's best, and in many ways, only friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend whom accompanies him to David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, David's occasional bed buddy. Kurt Russell plays Dr. Curtis McCabe, a psychologist interviewing David. All of their interactions, and the consequences of them, make Vanilla Sky one of the most emotional, and complex thrillers ever made. I won't explain anymore of the plot, because it's far more compelling, the less you know. Ignore all people that call this film too confusing to follow. If you pay attention, you won't be confused. The film is very complex, but not confusing. And in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made.",Vanilla Sky

He believes it is because of his face.The movie actually takes a turn as a brain teaser,post accident, not explaining things very clearly just like a weird dream. The ending could have been much better as it gives only a glimpse of what actually happened.It took the movie to where it started leaving many questions unanswered.Anyway it is worth a watch....",Vanilla Sky
525,belowzero8,Sweet and Sour,9,7 December 2007,"""The sweet is never as sweet without the sour."" This quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a young man who was handed everything in his life. He takes things for granted and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist. This film will keep you engaged in the plot and unable to pause it to take a bathroom break.Its a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it. You cannot really appreciate the better things in life (the sweet), like love, until you have experienced the bad (the sour). The theme will really get you to ""open your eyes"".Only complaint is that the movie gets very twisted at points and is hard to really understand. I think the end is perfect though. I recommend you watch it and see for yourself.",Vanilla Sky

I feared at one point that it was going to be one of those films with an unclear ending, or where you are left to make your own mind up about what happens next. Thankfully it wasn't.

A film can easily be confusing without being intellectual, and Vanilla Sky is a case in point. Yes, I did find it difficult to understand and frustrating, but not because it was clever.The underlying story has been done so many times that the ending was no surprise, it was just disappointing and slightly ridiculous - almost a cross between The Matrix and Soylent Green. The path to the conclusion was tortuous in the extreme, with a touch of unintended comedy - if Cameron Diaz had turned into Penelope Cruz one more time, I'm sure I would have laughed out loud.Overall, very disappointing after the hype.",Vanilla Sky

530,kevdor,Don't bother...,1,5 November 2006,"I just don't know where to begin, but I'm still trying to understand what people can find in this mediocre movie to give it an average of 6.8/10... Seriously the movie is sad from beginning to end, it just does'nt leave a good general feeling, so unless you just feel like hanging yourself don't even bother renting it. Not that I'm only sold to typical happy endings, but in my opinion a movie needs to have a little twist or leave you with a little something to think about, this one just makes you feel depressed, and that's it. Why would I want to rent a movie that makes me feel that way? I was also very disappointed by Tom Cruise on this one for two reasons: -First, for being a big Tom Cruise fan, I found that he just doesn't seem to fit at all for this role, it's not like any other movie he's made. He's a good dramatic actor, but something just didn't feel right with this character.-Secondly, his performance is very average, I didn't find him as convincing as he could have been, but then again with such a boring and depressing plot line, what could you expect.Bottom line, don't even bother unless it's on TV and there's absolutely nothing else on..",Vanilla Sky

It's just exactly the same as the stunning and brilliant original, Abre los Ojos, so in fact it's nothing more than an ordinary rip-off.

534,gregherk,"Confusing, not weird",10,17 January 2002,"I think a lot of people just wrote this off as another one of Tom Cruise's weird movies (Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut) but Vanilla Sky is definitely its own movie. Many people said it was weird; it wasn't. It was different and confusing but not weird. Weird is Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore. Different is The Truman Show. Confusing is The Matrix or The Game. And unlike Kubrick, this movie has a conclusion. Everything makes sense -- maybe not immediately, maybe not even today, but it will make sense. Vanilla Sky is confusing because David Aames (Tom Cruise) is confused. THAT'S the point. That's where the so-called ""weirdness"" that turned critics away came in. If they had bothered to ""open [their] eyes"" as the original 1997 Spanish movie, they would have seen that. And if that's not enough reason to see it, go see it for the music. Cameron Crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack; he uses it to set the ""feel"" -- that notorious element that many movies lack. With songs like The Beach Boys' ""Good Vibrations"" playing at the dramatic and emotional climax of the movie, he creates an offbeat, yet astoundingly ""right"" feel. A wonderful film, in its script, music, acting, and images, Vanilla Sky is sadly, a superficial bandwagon movie that critics chide in order to appear intelligent. Excellent: A+",Vanilla Sky
535,geoff-81,"An essentially good, albeit flawed, movie.",7,28 January 2002,"Vanilla Sky had the potential to be a modern classic, but is let down by mediocre performances by its leading stars, Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. Tom Cruise is not bad in this film, but never engrosses himself in his role to the level of Eyes Wide Shut and Magnolia, where he captured a previously unimpressed sector of ""serious"" film fans. He's gone back to the bright, white-toothed Jerry Maguire mode, a more universally appealing, but shallower, character. However, the Achilles Heel of Vanilla Sky is the totally inept performance of Penelope Cruz. To be fair, this is the result of a hopeless miscast, as Cruz's acting limitations are only part of the problem. In the movie the director, Cameron Crowe, expects us to believe that the shallow, hedonistic David Aames (Cruise) would drop the salacious Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) like a ton of bricks for the Spanish cutsie, Sofia (Cruz).",Vanilla Sky
536,Jonny Nashville,Utter disappointment,4,12 December 2001,"I managed to catch a sneak preview of this film at my university and have to say I was thoroughly unimpressed. Cameron Crowe crafts an enthralling and disturbing first two acts, only to ruin his work with a pathetic cop-out ending. I'm not sure how much Crowe's plot deviates from the foreign language original, but this is a truly disappointing effort from one of the industry's better writer/directors. The film is rendered all the more disappointing when you realize that some truly great dialogue (especially from Jason Lee and Penelope Cruz' characters) was squandered on an utterly forgettable movie.",Vanilla Sky

538,kubrick09mp,Another success for Crowe,8,10 January 2002,"Crowe's follow up to Almost Famous is more ambitious, which probably explains why it is not as tightly woven.  The existential plot, however, provides the viewer with much to think about.  There is so much to ponder in this film, I suggest seeing it a second time. Crowe is a master at screen romance, and it definitely shows in the palpable chemistry between Cruise and Cruz (Crowe said he was delighted that he caught these two falling in love on screen).  The brilliance of the romance leads the plot turn (not to be spoiled by this reviewer) to have an even greater resonance.  A fantastic film.",Vanilla Sky
539,BusterB,Interesting premise... weak execution,5,14 January 2002,"This film is at its heart a thriller. The question that nags at you from halfway through the movie is, ""What the heck is going on here?"" No, I didn't see the ending coming, so on that level it worked for me as a puzzlebox of a movie.Nonetheless, in my books a thriller has to have four things going for it before it rates:1. You can't see what's coming from a mile away. In this sense, Vanilla Sky was fine. I see that one or two people here had the ending pegged, but I sure didn't.2. Once you know how things end up, you should be kicking yourself because you ""should have figured it out."" Again, Vanilla Sky delivers: there are enough clues throughout the film (over and over and over) that I should have clued in. However, the clues seem unconnected to the story, so I took the bait didn't make the connection. Two good marks for Vanilla Sky.3. There should be a credible, interesting alternative explanation. Here I found the film a letdown. What's the alternative explanation? That he's going crackers? This didn't hold my interest long. As such, I found the film turned into a long series of weird events that I couldn't make sense of... until the end. Fun thrillers are fun when you think you have it figured out except for one or two nagging inconsistencies... and then you find out you've been led down the garden path. I spent a third of Vanilla Sky either not knowing what was going on or not caring, until I finally found out in the last ten minutes. Not very satisfying.4. You have to care about what happens to the characters. I think that this is Vanilla Sky's biggest failing. I must say up front that I've never seen a Tom Cruise movie before. I know: hard to believe; where have I been? Regardless, I found it hard to get interested in his character, because I couldn't figure out what he was feeling throughout the beginning of the film. I took away the impression that he has only five facial expressions: toothy smile, pouty look, angry frown (pouty look without lip extended), ""that look"" he gives the women that makes them swoon, and quizzical frown. This last one appears much of the time throughout Vanilla Sky, and it simply wasn't enough for me to connect to the character. As such, I had trouble caring about what was happening to him near the end. Tom Cruise spends part of this movie wearing a mask, and oddly enough I found him a better actor with it on: he displays more emotion with his voice and his body movements than with his face.Overall rating: Rent this one. There is nothing in it that requires the big screen and it isn't worth the big ticket entry price, unless you love Tom Cruise or, like my wife, you have vertigo and want to sit in the front row and have your stomach do flips during the New York flyover scenes.",Vanilla Sky
540,The Mad Reviewer,Cameron Crowe's tantalizing film sticks with you.,9,17 January 2002,"VANILLA SKY (2001) Rating: 9/10Before seeing this movie you need to bring your imagination, intellect and your sense of wonder to this film, along with a friend if someone's handy. You will need all four - the latter is critical to talk through your impressions and the film's possibilities over a nice cafe mocha after the show.It's not another date movie of the kind Hollywood routinely churns out. There's a lot to like about this movie. It demands to be watched ""Closely!"" Open your eyes... (where'd I here that?) Now there's nothing wrong with fun fare of, say Charlie's Angels and Shrek. To all flicks, a purpose. Those are frolicks. This one is more comparable to a philosophical lecture, where the professor insists you learn by immersing yourself in the experience. Each has entertainment value. This one simply demands your full attention to ""get it"".The movie is very different from what the commercials make it out to be. It turns out to be more of a fantasy film actually. And it is a ""thinking"" film that made me want to talk about afterwards, which is always cool with me. There are also lots of humor and witty dialogue throughout the movie, much more than you would expect from seeing the trailers. Jason Lee seemed to get the bulk of the funny bits (as always), but Tom Cruise gets in his share of memorable zingers, too.Having said that, I think a lot of what makes this a success in my book are the five great performances by the leads. Tom Cruise is at his charismatic best, and Penelope Cruz is more lovable than in any other movie I've seen her in. The two of them have palpable chemistry, I have no trouble believing that the sparks continued long after Cameron Crowe yelled ""Cut!"" Jason Lee is, not surprisingly, perfectly cast, having mastered the art of playing the smart-ass best friend in Kevin Smith's flicks. The real surprise is Cameron Diaz. I've adored her ever since she first entered that bank in 1994s The Mask. She then proved surprisingly game in There's Something About Mary, and she revealed an edgier side of her acting in Being John Malkovich, but this (for lack of a better term) psycho bitch turn is still quite shocking! I'll never see her as a harmless blonde sweetie ever again! Cruise also does some of his most interesting acting when events spin out of control, showing a much darker side of himself. As in Eyes Wide Shut and Magnolia, I think the fact that we're used to seeing him as such a successful stud makes his breakdown even more affecting.Behind the camera, Cameron Crowe is as ""on"" as he's never been. With the help of cinematographer John Toll and his wife Nancy Wilson doing the score, he crafts a constantly stimulating succession of sounds and visuals, sometimes to rivetingly surreal effect. Plenty of scenes are still haunting me, from the Times Square opening to the breathtaking finale, through countless other great moments. And what about the soundtrack! A former Rolling Stone writer, Crowe always puts together bitching soundtracks for his movies. Think of the use of ""In Your Eyes"" in Say Anything, of ""Free falling"" in Jerry Maguire, the Seattle grunge in Singles, or the Led Zeppelin tunes in Almost Famous. Now in Vanilla Sky, we can hear such great artists as Radiohead, REM, the Beach Boys, Bob Dylan and Peter Gabriel, all used to near perfection. I mean, some will disagree, but I found the ""Good Vibrations"" music cue just priceless, I had ""Solsbury Hill"" caught in my head for the whole day and even Joan Osborne's ""One of us"" took on creepy undertones!Vanilla Sky explores some very intriguing territory, which will confuse the hell out of a lot of people, but give it time, there is a point and some sense to make off it all in the end. Some might argue that it's better to leave things unexplained than to tie everything up, but in this particular case, I thought the exposition served its purpose, and as delivered by Noah Taylor (""Tech support!"") and Tilda Swinton, it doesn't feel tedious. And then, the movie reaches a payoff. To reverse one of the film's leitmotiv, since you got more into the sweet early scenes, the sour elements hit even harder, and when you don't expect it no more, ""sweetness follows"" and you leave the theater still on a high, wondering what it is that would make you most happy.",Vanilla Sky
541,stigwiksnes,Wow,9,8 May 2003,"When I decided to see this movie, I didn't know what to make of it as I had no expectations at all. I have not seen the original ""Open Your Eyes"", so fans of that particular flick, please excuse my ignorance.The whole movie starts out interesting enough but then it gets a little bit slow for a while. Things start to get really interesting when Tom Cruise is involved in the car accident caused by Cameron Diaz. From there on, the movie plays like an imotional rollecoaster and gets more intresting all the time. What I really liked was that I, as a viewer, always thought I had it figured out but in the very next second I was proved wrong. The way the movie ends was a surprise to me, yet believable. I loved it.The directing of the movie is excellent, there are lots of memorable scenes in the movie, my favorite three must bee; 1: The Times Square Scene  2: The Car Crash Scene  3: The Rooftop Scene. The opening scene is also very good, backed up by very suiting BGM; ""Everything In it's Right Place"" by Radiohead...perfect. Radiohead may also be heard in the background in the restaurant scene, the also very suiting ""I Might Be Wrong"". The rooftop scene is themed with Sigur Ros's excellent Njosnavelin, also known as the Nothing Song. The performance of Tom Cruise really impressed me in this movie, I really think it is his best performance right after the performance in Magnolia.

I know there will be many who disagree with my views on this movie, but there are also many who will agree.Vanilla Sky is just fantastic.  It has a quite original twist than most movies around.  Because of this twist, it is one of those great movies such as 'the Sixth Sense' and 'Arlington Road' which after watching it, you feel as though you HAVE to see it again, now that you know what is really happening throughout the film.  Without spoiling it too much for others who haven't seen it, there is a certain feature in the plot which is shown throughout many times and you don't realise just how important it is until the end.  Vanilla Sky is also the only film which i have seen twice at the cinema.On another note, i have never thought too highly of Tom Cruise before, and never considered him a good actor.  His performance in his role in this movie, changed my opinion.  i have never seen him act like this before and it all added to the greatness of this movie.",Vanilla Sky
544,crmang,One of the finest movies ever made that few know about,10,3 June 2008,"If you are disenchanted with the movie industry these days for the lack of quality, you are not alone. If you want to see a relatively new movie that delivers on many levels, Vanilla Sky is a leading candidate. I will spare the details of the plot, but will give you a primer on how to appreciate this fine work of art to enhance your movie-watching experience. To begin, the allusion to impressionistic art is not a coincidence. The art of impressionism embodies a whole set of socio-historical ideas that add depth to the movie. The beautiful ""Monet-like"" skies represents a disillusion with realism and an erasure of memory, evident in the visual display of distortion and haziness in many impressionist paintings. The scene in which these impressionistic skies appear reveal the emotional torment of the past as well as the desire to distort or rewrite it. This makes the main character's initial starting point as a wealthy playboy instead of a pauper essential in framing the movie's plot twist. In addition to its crafty and artistic themes, the movie has a strong soundtrack that is both enjoyable and fun, but very appropriate for the scenes. Despite the lack of dynamic characters in this movie, with the main character being the only one although he too is rather static, the movie delivers a revelation that can only be appreciated with more than one viewing. It is through this second or third viewing that you pinpoint the scenes in which the main character has revelations about the nature of his reality and realizes whether or not he is dreaming. Through these scenes do you see his transformation. Simultaneously, through these scenes do you as the audience vicariously experience this change. This movie is not about character development, it is about audience awareness of reality and fantasy. Will you be able to tell if a painting is impressionistic or a realistic landscape painting from afar? Probably not. Will you be able to discern a real scene from a dream in this movie without well-marked cues? It's unlikely. It is through careful analysis will one be able to determine the true nature of the scene, real or fantasy, and the depth of the audience's understanding alone will add depth (and appreciation) to this masterpiece. These visual cues will be revealed within the movie, but you will realize that your ability to distinguish between what's real and what's not is the driving force of the movie apart from the beautiful imagery and iconography. The Great Gatsby was not considered to be a ""Great American Novel"" immediately after its release. It took a decade for the novel to be rediscovered and then catapulted into its deserving place today as an icon of American literature. I make no qualms about my desire to have this movie also be catapulted into its place among the greatest movies of all time as well. In the midst of the terribly banal climate of movies today, I hope my post will motivate some more attention for this great movie.",Vanilla Sky
545,sharin728,I really didn't care for this movie!,5,1 September 2002,"This movie was really very hard for me to follow. I didn't know what was real and what wasn't but I guess maybe that was the idea. Tom Cruise was excellent as he usually is, but this movie was a bit too surreal for my taste. Disappointing!",Vanilla Sky
546,jasonford1987,My personal favorite movie!,10,13 May 2009,"Above all else in a film, I look for emotional connectivity, and substance. There needs to be depth there. Vanilla Sky delivers like no other movie I've seen yet. It may not seem so for the first view of the film. I admit it is somewhat of a tangled bit of processes, if you will. However, it's also one of those movies - and really more than any other movie I know of - that you can watch again and again and only enjoy it more each time.I still am uncertain about the true nature the film's story, though, even after watching it many times. Personally I view this as a good thing. I have little doubt that it was made so that this was the case. Is the whole film a dream that David is having during a coma? Or only the portion between the car wreck and the final image of the opened eye? Is it exactly what the film says it is? The viewer is in as much confusion as to the difference between dreams and reality as David is. The scene directly after the crash, amongst the trees is superb. The emotional twinge when David realizes it's a dream can be felt by anyone, since we all know what it's like to dream such a pleasant dream but to awaken to less.The culminating elevator and roof top sequence wraps everything up wonderfully. A lot of people may be disappointed that the mysteries of the film are somewhat revealed here, but I think it is very well done in that it doesn't reveal too much, certainly not the details; instead, it reveals the core ratios that have played into the whole. Then it all concludes in that beautiful line: ""I want to live a real life. I don't want to dream any longer."" I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but I definitely consider this his best work. His usual overbearing idioms are offset by the horrible disfigurement he bears through half the movie, to add even more dimension to a great performance. Kurt Russel is also superb as Dr. McCabe. I would love to see him in another like role. Finally, the soundtrack is without a doubt the best from any movie. If anything Vanilla Sky is worth watching only to feel the way the music saturates the emotional landscape.In conclusion, if you're willing to be confused, willing to accept unanswered questions, and enjoy an emotionally vivid film, Vanilla Sky is a delight. It's not a lighthearted view, you must be thoughtful and ready to let the movie take you where it will. Like any good art, it's a different experience for each different viewer.",Vanilla Sky
547,IronMonkey22,Great,10,2 December 2002,"This is such a great movie. It's the kind of film that some people hate and others love. Kinda like MOHULLOUND DR., FIGHT CLUB, and the recent SOLARIS.

548,FScottFitzhemingway,Underrated - gets better with time,8,18 August 2012,"Personally a favorite of mine. The casting of Tom Cruise is spot on; The supporting cast is wonderful. Cameron Crowe took a big risk making this film; A science fiction thriller that you do not realize it is. Looks more like a Tom Cruise vanity film on the surface. based on the 1997 Spanish movie (Open Your Eyes) Crowe has made a masterpiece; Unfortunately with the short attention span of the movie-goer, they did not ""get it"" nor wish to understand it, nor care a rich guy came back from the dead. Much deeper then that. See it again, or see it for the 1st time. soundtrack is like all Crowe movies 1st rate and heartfelt. Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky is a scrupulously moral picture. Roger Ebert's said It tells the story of a man who has just about everything, thinks he can have it all, is given a means to have whatever he wants, and loses it because — well, maybe because he has a conscience. Or maybe not. Maybe just because life sucks. Or maybe he only thinks it does. This is the kind of movie you don't want to analyze until you've seen it two times.",Vanilla Sky

550,s-fuge,A succinct appraisal,9,1 May 2003,"A beautifully crafted film which may leave some with a feeling of unresolve. This is due to the nature of the main character's experiences.  Flitting from supposedly real events to the surreal it truly is a Lucid experience. The plot is hard to unravel at first but later starts to become apparent with a truly superb finale.  Set in New York about a man who has everything, the looks, the wealth, the lifestyle...but is it all as it really appears? Watch and you can decide.A great sound track to add to the impact of the whole experience opening with radioheads superb ""Everything In Its Right Place"" from Kid A, amongst many other gems.Watch out for the opening scene which was actually shot in Time Square, no CGI here!Definetly recommended but not for those who need the plot to be spelled out.

This movie, is older and seems to be a Love/Hate type and I hope that people who check here get a chance to read this because I think it's worth watching solely because if it connects to you, it will probably instantly become one of your top ten fav's. It's definitely ""out there"", no question, but Cruise, Diaz, Jason Lee and Penelope Cruz, (maybe Kurt Russell too) do incredible jobs and make the relationships very believeable (for instance the scene where cruise picks lee up in his car and they make small talk) if you can track my rating it's obvious that I am a little biased in my review, but I'm pretty sure that it's not unfounded and this movie has a lot of both entertainment and redeeming value if a little suspension of disbelief is your forte.",Vanilla Sky
553,rosenfield10-1,A thoughtfully moving story originally told.,10,16 September 2004,"I wish other film fans would feel what I feel when I watch ""Vanilla Sky"". It would be regarded as a classic, and referred to often as a cinematic achievement. I feel this is Cameron Crowe's greatest film, and Tom Cruise's finest performance. ""Vanilla Sky"" has deep and meaningful messages which stay in the soul long after the movie is over. The soundtrack is Crowe's finest to date. Crowe's direction, his screenplay, Cruise's lead acting, Cameron Diaz's supporting performance, and the photography all deserved Academy Award recognition. The fact that some viewers had trouble following the story leads me to conclude that this type of film is not to the greater public's liking. Nobody wants to concentrate on the details of every movie instead of enjoying the movie as a whole; however, I found the direction and storytelling in ""Vanilla Sky"" just as hypnotic and beautiful as Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" and David Lynch's ""Wild at Heart"". It's not hard to follow at all, if you feel your way through it. Viewing the film, I noticed the vanilla sky instantly (along with the sudden change in Sophia's attitude), and I realized there was something hidden...a mystery. I feel it is superior storytelling and direction. The chaotic episodes that occupy the film are David's perceptions of a world he cannot control. He loses his dignity by denying Julianna's feelings, and then he pays for it (with his good looks) when she drives him off a bridge. He suffers in pain, just like the pain he has caused. Later, when he tries to enjoy a second chance with Sophia through a lucid dream, his badly soiled conscience causes a malfunction. The movie ends with David getting a real second chance at life, a chance to take what he has learned from his mistakes, and apply it in a world, without Sophia, where he is constantly reminded that ""the sweet is just not as sweet without the sour"".",Vanilla Sky
554,sgolz,Most underrated movie of all time??,10,30 July 2009,"Is this perhaps one of the most underrated movies of all time? It seems most people just hated this movie. The simple explanation for this is that the nature of the movie is very dark and Director Crowe does a wonderful job of presenting an intellectual psychological masterpiece that just seems on first viewing to loose the average viewer.Watch this movie a second time, sometimes even a third time and you will pick up on all those hidden little details, those delightfully subtle clues and even some of the not so subtle clues to understand what is happening.On the second view you learn to appreciate the story of this movie which is a journey through the materialistic, egocentric condition that has been so linked to the American dream. On this journey first you see the superficial, the basic lusts and desires. Watch again you can see the deeper philosophical undertones (429 pop references, references to art, literature, classic cinema and music) that as the movie develops gain power to the point of literally destroying the superficial first perspective.This movie plays with perceptions and layers, blends dreams and reality to such a point that we reach a critical point of confusion. Then as all good stories should; brings sense out of the chaos.If you watched it once and hated it - but are a fan of psychological and philosophical works such as 'one flew over the cuckoos nest' 'Jean e jim' then give this a second chance. The second view is so much more rewarding!",Vanilla Sky
555,Mark_Beronte,A Masterpiece! Far superior to the Original,10,18 August 2014,"There seem to be two main criticisms of this film. Either it is confusing and hard to follow, or it is a poor remake of the original. I found both of these claims to be nonsense, but at least I can understand the first. The key to our understanding does not show up until the very end, but given this key, the movie is perfectly consistent, and you may not notice the greatness of the film without a second or a third viewing.As to the second claim, this film is superior to the original in every way I would care to compare them, and I can only chock up the opposite opinion to a common, and mostly justified, bias against any Hollywood film, especially one starring Tom Cruise. To this mindset, the film is doomed from the start, regardless of it's actual merits. I would normally share such opinions, but this film is something special. Tom Cruise is perfect in his role and as much as you might hate him personally as so many seem to do, he is very good, as is Penelope Cruz.Just some advice to new viewers, have patience and trust that in the end all will be explained. The first 40 minutes can turn a lot of people off, but just wait. and for those who have watched the movie only once and found it wanting, try watching it again. You may be surprised. After my first viewing I thought it was just OK, but after several it has become one of my top 10 favorite films of all time. You might want to give it another chance as well.",Vanilla Sky

Basically the movie is about Tom Cruise's character who spends his time grieving and moaning about his scarred face, then suddenly wakes up and he's okay. He hooks up with Penelope Cruz. Honestly, the plot was way too boring to follow. The highlight of the movie was seeing Penelope Cruz's boobs for 5 minutes, which wasn't even all that exciting. I honestly don't know why I sat through this garbage. ""This movie is supposed to make you think."" Yeah, it made me think that Hollywood has become a cesspool of bad story lines and overpaid celebrities. Definitely not worth your time. If you want a good drama movie, go see L.A.

The visuals are exemplary, the story is taut and keeps you involved.  But I don't know as if I'd recommend it to a friend:  It's not the typical crowd-pleasing movie.Tom Cruise plays...well...the stereotypical Cruise-ian disaffected man of privilege...no casting coup there.  He's good, but his character illicits little sympathy, which is crucial for this movie to work.Penelope Cruz is eye candy;  someday, maybe she'll master the English language and convince us how well she can act:  She's not ""there"" yet.Cameron Diaz gives an almost-Oscar-worthy performance...clearly the best of the bunch, totally convincing as a obsessive boink-on-the-side.Jason Lee gives his best performance thus far...which isn't saying all that much...keep trying, Jason!It sounds like I didn't like this thing, but I actually found it a compelling view...though to be quite honest, much of the plot points were way too similar to ""Mulholland Drive"";  Vanilla Sky seemed to throw in a male protagonist, a slightly-more-coherent storyline, and beautiful visuals to make it a tad different than Lynch's tale.Check it out...you might like it.

So I was expecting some kind of thriller/romance type movie. I was so delighted to be wrong. This was a truly compelling movie. Visually stunning, it still managed to grip both based on plot and character. Replete with plot turns and unexpected developments, there was no way to know what to expect. Cruise, Russell, Diaz and Cruz were all believable in tough situations, and compelling. Crowe combined the best that modern special effects have to offer with some great basic cinematography and direction, including an awe-inspiring beginning in Time Square.

559,kadrock4,no words describe,10,15 December 2001,"but I will try...It's hard to discuss this film without giving anything away, so first I will present the basic ambiance, but after that my comments will in some shape or form resemble spoilers.I ask all film lovers to appreciate Vanilla Sky for its beauty.  Visually, the film is a masterpiece.  Sometimes as an audience, we focus too much attention on the plot and ""whether or not it will deliver,"" and we forget to relax and allow the imagery to dazzle us.  Additionally, I would like to stress the same about the film's music.  Crowe, like PT Anderson, is renowned for his film's soundtracks.  Plot is so much more than a script and a cast...if a director so chooses, s/he is able to literally use music/lyrics as a tool to enrich the audience's cinematic experience (think Magnolia).  [(*SPOILER!) A perfect example within the film  is the climactic moment when Cruise's character David is running through the halls of the ""Life Extension"" building to the tune of the Beach Boys ""Good Vibrations""...for some reason, it fits and the scene becomes that much more powerful. (*END SPOILER)] Crowe's talent for such techniques is not just prevalent in the film, but one of his best executions thus far.  To experience Vanilla Sky simply at this level was well worth the money.To take things way beyond perhaps where anyone needs to take them, the one to two hour (or more!) period after viewing is an experience in itself. First, the attempt to figure everything out (think Memento) is always fun if you aren't the type of person who simply becomes frustrated and angry. Second, the attempt to relate the film to society and the like can be a treat if you are so inclined.  [(***SPOILER!) For example, the concept of David's vanity--did he really choose to end his ""real"" life because he was afraid Sophia would never love him as a disfigured man?  Or was love completely absent from the situation; was it all just about vanity--Sophia never truly existed and David was simply devastated that his looks were gone?  How about the concept of American/Western technology?  David wanted to live the perfect life and attempted to fix his situation by turning to this new technology only to find that even *it* has its glitches. America/Western civilization is renowned for its high tech gadgets and inventions...only to attempt to cover up our 'disfigurements' of poverty, crime, drug problem, etc.(*END SPOILER)] It's an age-old tale, and perhaps these are realms most movie-goers could care less about exploring, but when a film encourages its audience to think outside the box...tell me what is so ""disappointing"" about that?10/10 for the visual and auditory experience 10/10 for stimulating that stuff up there we call 'the mind'And please, PLEASE do not sit in the theatre waiting for the film to deliver.

""Open Your Eyes"" (Abre Los Ojos) is a far superior picture mainly because of the differences in focus.  In ""Vanilla Sky,"" scenes were drawn out way too much, and important scenes lost their impact to the hip music and style that populated the remake.  The original is an odd, creepy film that never loses focus and keeps you thinking for days. However, ""Vanilla Sky"" tried to explain too much, tried to add emphasis on too much, and ultimately failed.I love Cameron Crowe: Almost Famous, Jerry Maguire, and Say Anything (in order from best to worst) are all terrific.  Thus, I can only imagine that he made this film not in order to make a good movie but in order to get an audience for the far superior original (he's succeeding).  I will say that overall I enjoyed ""Vanilla Sky,"" but since I had seen ""Abre Los Ojos"" before, I was disappointed by the fact that it could have been better. (SPOILER?)

Not because of how bad it is (bad movies are made all the time) but of how bizzare it is. I watched this film expecting a clever, suspenseful thriller. Was I ever wrong, Vanilla Sky is the bastard offspring of Sci-Fi, Romance, Drama and Arthouse, and instead of revealing bit by bit of the plot, leaving you on the edge of your chair in suspense until the end of the film, it is contrived and ridiculous.

567,JRosstaman27,The best movie I've seen this winter so far..,10,17 December 2001,"Vanilla Sky has been the best movie I've seen this winter so far.  It was totally not what I expected, which made the movie a whole lot better for me. I only seen one preview and of course didn't pay any attention to the critics (which would be someone's first mistake).  It was a movie to be seen with an open mind.  I know it takes some twists and turns which for a moment may seem confusing and pointless.  Like most movies that do this, Vanilla Sky also offers explanation.  So while watching the movie, don't worry about figuring it out, it'll get explained.Vanilla Sky is a great love story and about the little things we take for granted in life.  It's a very inspirational movie about what true love might really be and the moments that happen that shape our lives.  This movie touches on many emotions, much like the emotions that I felt while watching The Sixth Sense.   I thought the writing was spectacular.  The use of line repetition throughout the movie was fantastic.  It kept making me think about the movie as a whole, the way movies should be thought of.If there's one movie to see this winter, it's Vanilla Sky.  It'll take you on a wild roller coaster ride that's worth the wait.",Vanilla Sky
568,dimfeld,Good until the very end,7,2 August 2002,"Most of Vanilla Sky was done well.  The characters are interesting.  The plot leaves the viewer guessing until the last five minutes or so, when the movie ends in an unfortunate manner.  Basically, one of the characters just tells David (Tom Cruise) what was actually going on throughout the movie. Rather than letting him and the audience discover it for themselves, the movie simply tells you in a conversation.  I found this quite disappointing. Now, I didn't have a problem with what the ending was.  It actually fit quite well.  I simply wish it was presented in a different fashion.The only other flaw in this movie was the music.  Cameron Crowe has a bad habit of using classic rock in his movies in rather inappropriate places. Most of the time it fits well, but there were a few scenes in which the music didn't fit the action at all.  Classic rock is fine and appropriate for a movie like Almost Famous, which is about the music world, but for other movies, such as this and Jerry Maguire, sometimes a good instrumental is all you need.  The music problem, however, was but a minor annoyance that only manifested in one or two scenes.Despite the expository ending, I do recommend this movie.  Better yet, see Abre Los Ojos.",Vanilla Sky
569,capitol_bryan,Cameron Crowe blows my mind again,10,17 December 2001,"after Kevin Smith, Cameron Crowe is probably a toss-up for my next favorite filmmaker with Edward Burns.  Almost Famous is my favorite movie of all time....and I didnt think anything could pass Mallrats for that title. This film, is of course, a remake of the 1997 spanish flick ""Obres Los Ojos"" (open your eyes).  Having not seen the original...I'm afraid to see it now because I dont think anything could be better than a cameron crowe film. This movie, unfortuanatly, will be hated by so many.  This is unfortunate because it is a beautiful and original piece of art.  It's just people today arent into the 2:30 movies of dialogue and story plot anymore....they were suckered into crap flicks like She's All That, The Mummy Returns, Harry Potter, and Summer Catch crap where Freddie Prince Jr. will always get the girl in the most simplest of tales.....its 1:30 of filth and bim boom your out of there.  Well Vanilla Sky is a well made movie....that is like nothing like you will ever see.  The only draw-back is Penelope Cruz (aka Salma Hayek2)  when she gets an english accent and learns to speak better she can come back to the country.  Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are good but the movie is best when Jason Lee is on camera.  This man is brillant.  Lee is such a great actor....the best there is...ill pay money to see him everytime, even if it is more Hollywood predictable stuff like Heartbreakers, or his soon to come ""A Guy Thing"" which im sure will be too....but still, that man can single handedly carry a movie.  Vanilla Sky is a dark tale of a nightmared proned Tom Cruise.....who falls for Jason Lee's Penelope Cruz, but still cant resist that Cameron Diaz beauty...and takes a bad choice car ride with her....this will change his life forever...throw in Kurt Russel, Jason Galeki, Black Angus Steak House, Conan O'Brien, and Benny the Dog....and you have the masterpiece known as....Vanilla Skyso do urself a favor...if ur one of good taste...and open your eyes (ahahaha get it?) and see this movie....2 thumbs up from ebert and roeper...and by me....booya",Vanilla Sky

The first 1/2 hour progressed like any other movie, with the general presentation of the characters. But after this, the movie just started spinning around ( no other way of describing it ) and everything just became.... wierd! I even considered turning it of, and only watched it out of curiosity, 'cause I couldn't see a way for the producers to get out of the mess they had created with all the different lines and ""backsteps"" that twined through the storyline. And then it really began to twist.I will not give away anything about what happens here, but I was left dumbfolded, with tears in my eyes, and a sensation of sorrow and joy at the same time. Only one movie that I can recollect right now have given me the same ""eruption"" of emotions, and that was another brilliant movie that Tom Cruise starred in; Magnolia.

If you are not too bright, this movie will leave you confused.  If you think that a movie should spoon feed the surprises and show it's colors with big broad strokes (maybe a huge arrow saying, ""Here's the point!"") then this movie may frustrate you.Vanilla Sky requires that you be willing to make a leap of faith - that you simply receive the story in expectation of a resolution.  If you can do this, this film will reward your patience as very few films have.  This is not ""cinema."" It is a mystery.  If the critics feel it doesn't live up to it's Spanish-language predecessor, Boo Hoo Hoo.I'm recommending this movie.  Don't read the reviews. Don't let anyone give anything away to ""help you understand what's going on.""  Simply buy your ticket, sit down, and watch the movie as would a child.  Take it in without agonizing over details and cinematography and the surreal (sometimes annoying) direction.  Trust me, it will all make sense at the end.You'll notice I've not talked about the acting.  It's very good.  I finally ""get"" what some people see in Penelope Cruz.

Is he smiling because he just scammed the 25 people who showed up out of $8.25 a person?  I was happy when he was deformed so I didn't have to look at that annoying smile.

578,StanGellner,Excellent mind-bender,8,7 January 2002,"As a fan of ""The Game"" I was happy to find another movie that put me in a similar frame of mind and mood. ""Vanilla Sky"" is certainly messing with your mind, and seems to enjoy doing so. After many confusing twists and turns you think you know it all by the end, but then you start thinking about it, and the more you think about it the more you question what you think you know... I realize this will not be a lot of people's cup of tea (as we can tell from the comments made by professional critics) but for me it was just what the doctor ordered.Highly recommended. 9/10",Vanilla Sky

This move stank.  Stank, it is probably still stinking somewhere right now.  Nothing personal against Tom Cruise and Camron Crowe, Jerry Maguire makes my all time top 10 list at number 10, but what the *^!@ was that.  And I dont want to here how I didnt ""get it""  or wasnt ""smart enough"" that movie was garbage.  Im all in favor of a movie that all comes together in the end and leaves you thinking as you drive home, The Sixth Sense and Fight Club, for example, but I strait up wanted my money back.  Erotic thriller?  Whats erotic about Crowes recent habit of cast tiny chested women in topless roles, Cruz and Hudson.  This movies ending made about as much sense as the monkeys from Planet of the Apes flying in on helicopters to save the day in Black Hawk Down.  Erotic thriller, when?  Why, Why Why.  And I am expecially sorry about Camron Diaz being nominated for a Golden Globe.  She was in the movie for 9 minutes giving an unchallenged Lifetime Original Movie like performance, and hmmmm she swallowed what!  Jason Lee, run back to Kevin Smith and campout.  I am not alone.",Vanilla Sky
580,sellyoursuitandtie,"Astounding soundtrack, and not a bad film either (minor spoilers)",6,11 January 2003,"While ultimately Vanilla Sky is not as good as Abre Los Ojos (the Spanish film on which it was based) it is still a very entertaining and though provoking film.  Tom Cruise continues to surprise with his choice of roles, and he turns in another excellent performance as David Aames.  Penelope Cruz and Jason Lee do not disappoint either as David's love interest and best friend respectively.The film does manage to top the original in some areas too, particularly the now famous dream sequence in a deserted Times Square, which is far more effective than a similar scene in Abre Los Ojos.  The way in which Crowe builds on the 'dream-world' concept by using pop culture references (a Bob Dylan album cover, characters from To Kill A Mockingbird) when creating David's fictional world is also fantastic.However, despite all this, Vanilla Sky does have some annoying flaws. Julie Gianni, the character played by Cameron Diaz, does not actually appear all that insane or overbearing, making it difficult for the viewer to understand why Cruise rejects her in the first place, nevermind that this rejection would make Julie crazy enough to try and kill herself.Also, the ending of Vanilla Sky (unlike that of Abre Los Ojos) does feel a little spoon-fed, as if Crowe (a very mainstream director) believes that the audience should not be left to figure out anything for themselves.  This is a disappointing conclusion to what is otherwise a very thought provoking film.Where this film's greatest triumph lies however is in the soundtrack, which is quite simply astounding.  Much is made of Cameron Crowe's ability to pick out exactly the right song for the moment, and rightly so on this evidence. REM, Sigur Ros, Peter Gabriel, Radiohead, Jeff Buckley, Leftfield and Bob Dylan all appear and the selection, along with their positioning in the film, is absolutely flawless.So, 10/10 for the soundtrack but only 7/10 for the film, which is unfortunately just not as good as Abre Los Ojos.  Do try and see both films though, it'll be well worth your while.",Vanilla Sky
581,vanillafan,"A beautiful, soulful, thoughtful labour of love from Crowe and Cruise",10,29 July 2002,"I decided to review this movie here on IMDB only after having read tons of other user comments, which are notoriously split (just like the ""official"" critics' are) on a fifty-fifty ratio: ""This movie is awesome!!"" ... ""No, this movie is awful!!"", and so on.It surely is a love-it-or-hate-it picture, and the film-makers, best buddies Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise, have obviously always been fully aware of that.I consider myself very much among those who love it.I'm Italian, so I saw Abre Los Ojos (which was co-produced with Italian mini-major Lucky Red) long before I saw Vanilla Sky. I love Abre Los Ojos as well, but I enjoyed Vanilla Sky - lack of plot originality aside, natch - much more.Vanilla Sky, being a Cameron Crowe movie, has all the deeply felt research of the lead character's soul that Abre Los Ojos - which is gripping and genial but rather cold - doesn't have.I ached all the time for David (he's kind of a spoiled jerk, sure, but in his soul and mind are stirring, even before the accident, a thousand diverse feelings, and a refreshing confusion takes hold of him when he's in Sofia's apartment on that first - and last, actually - night they spent together).On the contrary, I can't say I felt the same pain for César, who is an arrogant brat before, during and after the accident (perhaps it has to do with the fact that the Spanish lead character César is a 25-year-old, as was star Eduardo Noriega at the time, and therefore is much younger than 33-year-old David Aames, and even more so than star Tom Cruise, who was a 38-year-old when he shot Vanilla Sky).That said, I saw Vanilla Sky more than once in the theater (bringing with me, each time, some very carefully selected, open-minded friend: they all loved it). Now I have seen it again on DVD.Well, each and every time I found myself glued to my seat, even though I knew the story from the very beginning. I was simply mesmerized: this movie is so dense and thoughtful; I will never grew tired of it!The credit here goes, in my opinion, mainly to the Herculean efforts of Tom Cruise, who has been my favorite actor since his wonderful turn in Born On The Fourth Of July, and as a matter of fact I think that David Aames shares more than a bit of rage, pain, desperation and bewilderment with Cruise's memorable Ron Kovic character, and even with his equally memorable Frank T.J. Mackey character from Magnolia.Those, for me, are the ideal roles where Cruise can totally express his dashing persona and his powerful on-screen generosity (so I'm patiently waiting for September 27, when Minority Report and his John Anderton will finally grace the Italian theaters), far better than playing the sleepwalking, muzzled Bill Harford he had to play (forcing himself, in his own words) while enduring the slow agony of Eyes Wide Shut.
I can't help to admire how much he's grown (as an extremely accomplished, skilled and soulful thespian) since his beefcake teenage idol days.
I surely disagree with those who say he's overacted and/or has merely played himself here, cockiness and mugging included. Are you kidding? The first third of the movie HAD to show the very shallowness of David Aames: the cockiness and the mugging  were vital for the entire following story development!As for the ""Tom Cruise merely plays himself"" issue, I'd like to end this review with a quote from the great, late director Billy Wilder (it's taken from ""Conversations with Wilder"", the acclaimed 2000 book by Cameron Crowe): ""He [Tom Cruise] is a thinking actor. He makes it look effortless. For example, Rain Man. It took several years for everyone to realize that the roles coul have been switched. That is a movie I would have liked to have seen - the crazy guy is the good-looking one. The ease in which he handles the hardest roles ... Tom Cruise, he's like Cary Grant. He makes the hard things look simple. On film, Cary Grant could walk into the room and say ""Tennis anyone?"" like no one else. You don't value the skill until you see a less skilled actor try the same thing. It's pure gold"".What can I add? It says everything. Those audiences who disliked Vanilla Sky might try again: it'll probably surprise them. It doesn't end to surprise me, either.",Vanilla Sky

The relationship between them is not credible anyway, it's not in the movie as it's not in real life. Cruise gives his character homosexual qualities, and that's not right.

587,stryders,"Imagination, Rapture and the Waking Dream",8,27 November 2011,"One seemingly petty, little, foolish choice is all it takes for an ideal life to turn into a nightmare. This seems to be the message as we watch publishing magnate David Aames, played by Tom Cruise, loose his million dollar good looks in a shocking car crash staged by his kamikaze lover.. This act one turning point In Cameron Crowe's 1997 ""Vanilla Sky"" is especially resonant to the culture that the character David Aames was created to comment on. He's a billionaire playboy; handsome, smart, riding high in corporate splendor, and full of himself. Just prior to the crash, Aames falls head over heels with, and blatantly steals his best friend's girl, the enchanting Sophia played by Penelope Cruz. Next morning he is confronted outside Sophia's apartment by the psychotic former girlfriend Julie, played by Cameron Diaz. He submits to a joy ride with her that ensnares him in a suicide pact. As his new fate would have it, Julie dies, David does not. He survives, but his face is destroyed. It becomes a scary cross to bear. We watch in dismay as the charismatic wunderkind reverts to awkward, juvenile social traits he once outgrew The masterful make-up of Aames post-crash face makes Cruise look alternately tragic, comic, frightful and pathetic, but all in sympathetic measure. Unable to abide this, Aames adopts a facial prosthetic that makes him look embarrassed, guilty, resentful and maudlin. Its haunted, plastic pout seems to plead, ""how could this be happening to me?"" Good friends try to help Aames with his pride as he slides into identity crisis. An effortlessly hip self-image was Aames' brand. The winning smile was his logo. Where did it all suddenly go? He's supposed to be the ace of a magazine empire, where cheated images pervade the pages. How very, very thin are a few layers of skin. To solve the dilemma of living life with either a deformed or a synthetic face, David Ames has his brain wired to some kind of pre-programmed dream that plays in his head while his body sleeps in cryogenic peace, presumably waiting for a technological breakthrough in reconstructive surgery. To ensure his dream on ice is nice and hot, Aames contracts with a shady tech company for a digital lover. It is, of course, Sophia, the wise, whimsical dancer he fell in love with before the accident. If the first crucial turning point was when Aames got in Julie's car, the next one is his choice to go to sleep and dream of love with Sophia rather than face the problem that stopped him in his tracks. What is the metaphor in that deep freeze we never get a look at in the center of this movie? How often lately have we seen our real life corporate and government leaders behave like leading men; on-screen pushing some fantasy romance with the voter/consumer, off-screen betting secret dreams and science will make-up their bets. This expertly tailored film scenario proceeds with Aames attaining what he never could in real life, true love. Achieving increasingly lucid states, he tries to take over the fantasy and make it real. It only brings more pain as Aames mistakes Sophia for Julie and his embrace tightens like a chain around her in bed, not loving but smothering her to death instead. It's a dreadful scene to watch and lands the masked Aames into a shadowy prison cell where he pleads his case to a corduroy shrink with perfect pitch played by Kurt Russell. This dose of therapy enables Aames to open a connection with the corporation that provides his dreams and confirm that the memory of Sophia's murder is complete artifice. It's just a technical glitch in the program caused by Aames efforts to gain control of the illusion. The mask eventually becomes a burden greater than the flaw he is trying to conceal, and it does come off eventually, but not without a piece of his hide. The mask has no power of it's own. It is a simple law of nature that any hiding place becomes a prison, the consequences of putting off an appointment with destiny. To attempt to live above, or be immune to, or cheat one's way through always ends up working against you. With the assistance of a tech support angel our hero eventually thaws out 130 years later. He can feel the weight of his real problems again and the consequences of going to sleep. Forsaking his privileged mindset he's grateful to leave the fantasy behind for ""real life."" Why did I like this story? Most of us are just as prone to this same character defect. I learned a lot from watching an ego, a mask and a shattered face all try to occupy the same space. In what ways am I sleepwalking in some illusion? We all seem to have to learn the same lesson about this. What else could explain how unbalanced our world feels? And how long will business and government leaders play make-believe with the future? Eventually they have to come out from behind their masks of company and committee and face the consequences too. Because, as this film makes so abundantly clear, we're all just putting off the inevitable.",Vanilla Sky
588,macknife-2,Vanilla Smug ...or....Cocktail Meets Donnie Darko,4,21 May 2006,"..sorry..just can't get past Tom Cruise..it's hard not to bail out of this one during the first hour or so, when every line of dialog is smug, contrived, and designed solely to prop up Cruises character as God's gift to women...oh hell..to ALL of us mere mortals..he's SO good looking..SO clever..SO smart..SO Tom Cruise.The movie DOES get more interesting in an other-worldly/ Donnie Darko kinda way, except then you have to deal with Cruise chewing up the scenery in an over-acting tour de force.See where I'm going here?? This would have been a better movie without Tom Cruise...in my humble opinion, ""understating"" always beats ""overacting"", something beyond Cruises comprehension, based on his body of work. Tom Cruise is a generally lousy actor who is ALWAYS playing ""Tom Cruise"" on and off the camera, and to give him his props, he is a very successful ""personality"" (but so too is Paris Hilton...). ....gotta go..renting COCKTAIL again tonite..kinda like a bad car crash, you just can't look away...poor Tom Cruise-as-COCKTAIL bartender, he just CAN'T even wander into a 7-11 without every member of the female gender-clerks, shoppers, vendors, nuns, whatever... shimmying out of their panty hose!!!

589,Nachtportier,Mr. Cruise meets Spirituality,1,26 December 2005,"The only two things I have heard about this movie in advance is that features lucid dreaming and that it's a remake from an European original. I haven't seen the original Spanish version yet, so I cannot compare these.Beginning of the movie is very promising, since it opens with an stunning wake-dream sequence (Tom Cruise driving & running on completely empty Times Square!). The big problem dealing dreaming in the story is that the main character's dreams aren't conscious  he actually has a big problem with his dreaming and real life  he cannot separate the two. He doesn't know if he's dreaming  when he's dreaming  thus ignoring the basic premise of lucid dreaming  which actually means: being aware of yourself being in dreaming. So much for the lucid dreaming part  this one has to be dismissed  somebody didn't do the proper homework on that.Second problem of the movie is the main character embodied in Mr. Cruise (who also co-produced the movie). His acting has never been more superficial, it gets painfully funny when he displays himself as rich, self-confident, prolific and sexual superhero without - even a slightest amount of irony. He plays this part so serious & intense that it gets absurd already at the very beginnings. Unintentional the viewer starts to ask himself: is this Mr. Cruise only playing himself  an superstar and fanatic Scientologist? Mr. Cruise is hanging so stiff on his performance and sticks unbelievably hard & intense on convincing the viewers of his superpowers that on the end very strong doubts come up: could be he's impotent in reality? Could be the rumors about his homosexuality are true? If you can deal with the above facts go for the plot. The story reveals itself in multiple layers. There is an indefinably amount of parallel time sequences. The audience actually never knows what is real or what is just been a dream  since our hero cannot distinguish his dreaming from real life (I hope this point is not 100% autobiographical, but who knows). The story somehow promises to reveal itself in the far future, but it just gets stacked over and over with new layers of questions and doubts. Usually there would be some suspense created upon this permanent pending state, yet Vanilla Sky just gets boring over time and manages to make you angry.The largest psychological flaw is: our hero goes through some significant personal dramas (car accident, loss of a friend, loss of physical beauty, loss of personal integrity...etc.) yet Mr. Cruise' performance doesn't significantly change during that. There is no personal disintegration to feel  only to see. Actually the acting flaws terribly during the mask scenes (he wears a mask that covers his face) and especially during the disfigured face scenes (really heavy makeup), because Mr. Cruise acts angry and loud, just like he always does, when he's fit. A person going through all that drama would significantly change in their body language, but Mr. Cruise obviously cannot leave his body acting (habits).There are two breaks in the rhythm which somehow dissolve the dense layers of reality/fiction/dreaming, these breaks annihilate the tension and kill the film. The first break are the shrink sequences (played by Mr. Kurt Russel, who looks completely out of place here), these scenes are ruined by Mr. Cruise' dull display of self-pity and heavily exaggerated body talk. Also Mr. Russel works mechanic, the only thing missing is seeing him peeking on his wrist watch and saying  okay, I'm finally done, now give me the check. The second much more significant break is both visual and conceptual  when the whole movie turns into something what looks like some sci-fi allegory  yet again it isn't allegoric, because it tries to explain the whole thing (the last 20 minutes). The movie is by far to long (140 min).It's not a cheap movie. The soundtrack alone must have cost a fortune (Paul McCartney composed a theme). Speaking about music  the songs are good, but the way they are used are trying to cache either weak acting (P. Cruz) or bold performance (Mr. Cruise). It gets very schmaltzy & kitschy when those unequal two appear together in a love scene, even the best songs look cheap then, like mixed by an amateur filmmaker. There are some interesting special effects, but the best things are real (Times Square scene). The best performance in the long list of stars is surprisingly done by Cameron Diaz. At the beginning she acts shallow and arrogant  just like a mirror of Mr. Cruise, but later on she grows (over the level of this movie) and delivers remarkably stunning performance (the car scene).If you take this movie serious you will probably be strongly disappointed, there are simply too many flaws. If you look at it as light entertainment, you will be frustrated even more  with only one exception: if you like open end movies that drive nowhere. Vanilly Sky won't dazzle your mind, it will only stress your patience & intelligence.",Vanilla Sky

That was a time when I didn't understand the Grammer of cinema that well. It still remains as one of my top favorites, however, I do understand why it has failed to impress the critics. The biggest problem I see is the need for exposition. This movie takes a very intelligent plot and ruins it by putting some extreme exposition in the end.

592,allisonsinclair1976,A great psychological movie.,9,12 November 2012,"This was a thoroughly enjoying movie. I can understand how some people did not like this movie, probably the actors or that it is a real thinking movie with some twists that you have to pay attention to. This movie is a mix between a mystery, adventure and a romantic comedy and just a good all around story. The Tom Cruise character is a man that have everything anyone could ever want and more, he ends up loosing it and then gets a second chance with a catch. In the end facing all his demons and the full scope of all that is happening around him forces him to choose simplicity and reality. So that finally he can find the one thing he could never really get and thats happiness. As far as story lines go Tom basically inherits his dads company and has a 51% stake in the company. Since the board does not think he deserves the company he is constantly ad odds with them and himself living a meaningless life with a shallow Cameron Diaz. At his birthday party he meets Penelope Cruz who he instantly falls for. The morning after the part he ends up making a decision that will change his life forever and he soon finds out there is no going back. Tom Cruise does a fabulous job in this movie showing that he does have some range and seems that he has possibly been type-casted and should be given a more variety of roles after this. Penelope Cruz does a outstanding job playing the object of Toms affection. She brings a alluring innocence to the role that complements her character and makes her forthcoming and accessible, yet lacking any sense of mystery. Cameron Crowe knows how to get the best out of his actors and does a great job with Cruz. Cameron Diaz looks better then ever sizzles on screen. Make no mistake she delivers a complete package performance with her character. Her performance can be measured by having just a limited time on screen still leaves unforgettable performance. Half way through the movie really starts to question your sense of existence, but by the end all will be revealed. It is definitely wild, reality bending entertaining experience.

The gist here is that our hero, the rich and successful David Aames, is struggling to come to grips with a disfigurement caused in a terrible car accident by his stalking friend. We then are teased into wondering how much of David's reality is, well real, leading to a moment of realisation to the tune of said 'Good Vibrations'. Well, like I said, my first review, I can only go up from here but watching this film is like dawn on a calm summers day, freshness in the air and the sunrise on your face leaving you feeling inspired and glad to be alive. The cinematography is just stunning and the views of New York (including the famous empty Times Square shot) express the city like never before. Like him or Loath him, Cruise is great at conveying the feeling of confusion, that he is trapped in a surreal world that doesn't quite make sense. There's not much that could make this movie better for me, watch it and make your own mind up. Just make sure you watch it !",Vanilla Sky

Even Cameron Diaz and Jason Lee's performances were....well, silly.Admittedly, the story paralleled the original.

In fact, you'll be blown away by it.But if you cannot move past that or do not like movies that really make you think, then maybe you should go rent something like ""Fantastic Four"" instead. . . .",Vanilla Sky
597,amanmishra868,A must watch Psychological thriller,8,26 January 2018,"Vanilla Sky is an American Psychological thriller movie released back in 2001. The story of the movie revolves around and is focused on the life of David Ames played by Tom Cruise who is inherits his father's wealth. One day at his party he is introduced by his friend to Sofia Serrano with whom David falls in love with at first sight but at the same time he is avoiding Julie Gianni who supposedly has a thing for david because of their shared past together. Following some incidents the next day, David and Julie together meet an car accident which mutilates his face and after waking up up from comma he discovers that Julie died in that car accident. All of this is story told by David to his Psychologist in Jail where he is convicted for Julie's death. David has trouble remembering the incidents of the past and various incidents from different time period and with him we are set on a quest on finding out the reason why Julie died.Vanilla sky was an absolute treat an individual who enjoys cinema and whose favourite genre is psychological thriller. However movie does lack in a little visual department as movie could have been a little bit more dramatic with darker tone as everything just appears so normal that the viewer might forget he actually is watching a movie. As story progresses a lot of twists happen which can throw audience wondering and shocked. Unlike many other psychological thriller there is always one maniac with their own ideology and thoughts but David as a protagonist discovers his own different identity due to memory loss. Many memories of david are changed or replaced by himself for which movie hints multiple times at human's subconscious and how dangerous it is.
Acting in the movie is something that has to mention as Tom Cruise totally nails it as an guy with disfigured face.For some reason the first part of the movie is great but later for which david is having remembering issue is addressed very poorly as movie completely changes its tone from Mystery psychological thriller to this Science fiction setting and such transition will obviously not be appreciated by most of the audience however i liked it but people won't because it was not executed properly and most of the time went in establishing character of david in 1st half of the movie itself.
Vanilla sky in the end becomes one of those movies which had great and unique concept for which it is expressed very nicely but later half brings it down and for that reason the next time someone asks me to suggest them an psychological thriller movie, I won't definitely suggest them Vanilla Sky and the reason is that because I love this movie for what it is no matter how much I criticize it and if someone else complains about it, I won't be able to take that. The ending is of movie is totally like many great films where you are given answers and are left to wonder and imagine story according to yourself. And yes I do recommend it.",Vanilla Sky
598,lennon_reincarnated,A beautiful film,10,30 July 2005,"This is a movie I saw a long time ago, and recently visited after forgetting basically everything about it. And I guess my maturation since I originally saw it really did wonders, because this movie gripped me like few others do. I'd say it's probably my second favorite movie of all time, right behind Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind. The casting is perfect, and the characters are very interesting and believable as human beings. The music is what really grips me. Every song fits perfectly with the scene (except the REM song at the beginning when Cruise and Lee are in the car). The pacing is brilliant, never revealing too much too soon and never having a dull moment either. I have a hard time watching this movie without crying because it just teaches the viewer (assuming they are mature enough to get what this movie is really about) so much about life, how short it is, and how everything in life is sweeter if you've had the hard things to through.",Vanilla Sky
599,colm_tumelty,one of my favourite movies ever,9,7 October 2005,"i first heard of this movie as it played as a trailer in the cinema, immediately i was interested mainly because of the music which played throughout the trailer. it wasn't long before i went and seen the movie when it was released in the cinemas. i have never seen the original but i cant see how it could be better than this. the story if a little confusing at times is great, the actors play their parts brilliantly and once again the soundtrack is one of the best i have ever heard. i felt there were plenty of twists, one moment the movie would be happy, then it would turn sad, it had everything. i thought the ending in particular was brilliant, how David had to choose to be with the woman of his dreams or not and especially with the great music in the background. have watched this film about 4/5 times and it still feels great. i would certainly recommend this movie to anyone, some might not enjoy it but i think it should be given a chance.",Vanilla Sky

And dreams aren't to be controlled. The movie keeps you on the edge (not fast paced though). More of a Mulholland drive kind of. Sometimes you dont have to interpret the meaning of everything.

I have never been a big Tom Cruise fan but I want to give the guy the benefit of the doubt - he's a committed actor and he has played some good roles, despite being Hollywood's most annoying person. But Vanilla Sky? This movie is so full of crap, it actually makes me angry just thinking about it. Who knows what the hell it's meant to be about? Seems to me it was all about Tom Cruise wanting to star in a supposedly deep, quirky movie. But it's rubbish. And, quite annoyingly, everyone mumbles all the way through it. What a nightmare.",Vanilla Sky
602,DanielAlandoGarcia,"Based on the Spanish movie ""Abre Los Ojos""",10,13 April 2006,"David is a symbol of the trendy, superficial meaningless life that wealthy American society tends to produce. David has a nice car, fantastic condo, nice clothes, a pretty girl that he sleeps with whenever he wants (Juliana), no attachments, owns a successful magazine publishing company that he inherited from his father (so he even had no part in building it), and shows up to work basically when he feels like it. The Board of Directors and others run the company, David just reaps all the benefits! The only ""check"" in David's life is the Board of Director's (the ""Seven Dwarfs"") and he resents them for this!Karma - it is Karma that deals David a blow, by disfiguring him in the car crash. Disfigured, David can no longer rely on his good looks to cruise through life. Karma not only punishes David in this manner, but also gets even with David for treating Juliana in the manner that he did; and shows David how cruel superficiality can be when Sofia shows no interest in David after his face is disfigured. But even after David's accident, he can not see that his behavior had consequences. And it is his behavior that led him into the predicament that he finds himself in. He blames all of it on what he believes to be a conspiracy by the Seven Dwarfs to take control of his company. Ironically, the only real good thing we see David do before his accident, is to save the job of his family attorney (Tom), by keeping him on staff, giving him a 50% raise and ""the corner office."" This good deed is later repaid, because it is Tom who later in the story keeps the company in David's control, wresting it away from the Board of Directors. Sofia is shown to be as superficial as David is. Sofia is no longer attracted to David after his accident. Though she apparently saw the opportunity for love to bloom after the initial meeting that nite of the party, since his face is disfigured, she never sees David again after leaving him at the nightclub. She does attend the 3-day ""celebration of his life"" thrown by his friend, Brian, but one would believe that this was not so much to grieve the loss of David as it was to grieve the loss of the love that could have bloomed had he not became disfigured in the accident. This type of superficiality is a concurrent theme throughout the movie, and in each instance, this superficiality ends up punishing the individual that acts in this manner. Though the movie focuses mostly on David's superficiality and the consequences of his behavior, we do see Sofia being punished as well. She rejects David after the accident because he is no longer aesthetically pleasing to the eye, yet we see that she never gets over loosing him. Because Sofia can not see David beyond the pretty face that she was attracted to, she is punished with grief and never sees David again after the nite at the nightclub. When she attends David's wake at his apartment, thrown by his friend, we see a sad and despondent Sofia.If you would like to read more of my review - please visit my blog at http://danielalandogarcia.blogspot.com/ OR view my web site at www.danielalandogarcia.com",Vanilla Sky

604,stranger-3,"so much promise, unfulfilled...",6,12 December 2001,"This could have been a great movie, or at least a very good movie. Instead it ends up being merely an interesting so-so flick. Basic plot - David Aames (Tom Cruise) is a playboy millionaire living the good life, sleeping with his friend Julianna (Cameron Diaz) and playing tennis with his buddy Brian (Jason Lee). At a party he snubs Julianna and falls in love with Sofia (Penelope Cruz). Julianna exacts revenge by running her car off a bridge with herself and David inside, killing herself and disfiguring David. Weirdness ensues.The movie tries to be a psychological thriller/drama, but moves way to slow. It loses its way distracted by scenes that don't advance the mystery, tension or plot. At around 150 minutes, the movie runs close to 30 minutes too long. Tightening up the movie would have done wonders for it, really.The second major problem is the music - I've no idea what Crowe was thinking here. The music at parts is too loud and actually distracts from some of the more pivotal scenes in the movie.The ending of the movie also left me feeling rather cheated. With a mystery like Mulholland Drive all the pieces start to come together and you see it all fall into place. Vanilla Sky is reduced to having one of the characters go into a ten minute speech explaining the entire 140 minutes that came before. Ugh.In closing - a simple re-editing could improve the quality of the movie by a lot, removing the annoying soundtrack during certain scenes would help a little. Maybe we can hope for a new cut of the film when it hits DVD.",Vanilla Sky

Same story, same characters, and in the role of Sofia, same actress -- Penelope Cruz.Try to watch them both and see the effect of ""Americanizing"" a movie. This is an American reproduction of a Spanish original. The reproduction has everything American -- Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, even a ""newly discovered"" Penelope Cruz -- in place of the Spanish originals.The original was cast with actors, the copy was cast with stars.",Vanilla Sky

The movie tried to present itself as a surreal, magical view on...whatever, but goes on too long to be fun when its mysteries are revealed.  By the time the story starts explaining itself, the viewer has already imagined many more interesting finales, thus neutering the wonder.Leave it to my fellow New Yorkers' extensive groaning on the way out of the theater to fund the above research.  But back to the positive stuff- good acting, great characters, neat concept; and as an added bonus, bless the editors for not tastelessly tearing out images of the World Trade Towers like every other movie.Now, if only I got to write the last 40 minutes, it would have been perfect!",Vanilla Sky

Well, Cameron Crowe is two for two. He has successfully created my favorite film of 2001. This movie just clicks... I can't really explain it. On a technical level, it was fantastic. The production design, Camera direction, music, acting... it was all superb. Tom Cruise is AMAZING as David Aames, a devil-may-care heir to a publishing empire living in the pseudo-shadow of his father. Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, and my fave Jason Lee all pull fantastic performences out of the air. I can't even really put how I feel about this movie into words. Just go see it.

In this version:  protagonist endures a life-changing event and then the traditional rules of cinema no longer apply.So what is this film?  Is it an artist's rendition of an impossibly handsome and rich protagonist (Cruise) who dances through life with impossibly beautiful and charming girlfriends (Cruz and Diaz) beneath a vanilla sky? Is it a mosaic of idealized 20th-century Americana coupled with an eerily-effective musical score?  Is it perhaps a morality lesson, reminding us that beauty is only skin-deep and that indeed in a charmed life, one might not recognize true happiness?It's all of these and more.  Cameron Crowe shows that there's a lot more one can do with a perpetually-smirking Tom Cruise than ""Jerry Maguire"" and Phil Dick must be smiling from the grave (or the cryo tank).  What's not to love?",Vanilla Sky
612,aangen,Cameron Crowe So owns me,10,6 June 2002,"I really liked ""Almost Famous"" the first few times I saw it. Really nice piece. The music was a big part of it, being someone who was awake in the 60's and 70's. The characters and the story really hit a nice note with me. Easily one of my all-time favorite films. The ""Untitled"" version was better still.But ""Vanilla Sky"", oh baby this one goes deeper.There are segments where I think it may be too sappy. Then I remember that I love sappy sometimes. I was worried about Tom, but he was just fine. Better even.A few weeks ago I saw ""Mulholland Drive"". I loved it for what it was the first time through. I ""got"" more of it the second time through and I think I may have enjoyed it less. Last night, with zero clue as to anything about the film I watched ""The Mothman Prophecies"". I think it's in the same vein as Mulholland Drive and Vanilla Sky.Tonight, Vanilla Sky proved to me that Cameron Crowe can entertain me better than most, possibly the best. The story, the endless excellent scenes, the characters, the performances,the music, my my my. I really enjoyed those other two films, but this one....Sold.I think it will stand up too. Can't wait to watch it again. They are making better movies these days, at least from my point of view. But then, I liked ""The Mexican"" too so what do I know?",Vanilla Sky

It totally lacks all the mystic of ""Open your eyes"" and dont come close to the genuine ambience of the original film.

I am afraid it left me unmoved, though I was taken with the beauty of the sky in certain scenes. But in the end I think the story trips over its own cleverness and renders itself pointless. It feels as if they were trying for a ""Sixth Sense"" style surprise ending but they have become pretty much standard these days so unless its especially well executed it doesn't really surprise. Still, it could have been worse - it could have gone for the other trend and been 3 hours long.",Vanilla Sky
616,kfd,A very dull movie...,3,25 January 2002,"I thought this was a terrible movie. Clunky script, actors bouncing performances off of each other, sloooow pacing and the obligatory `twist' at the end (for those that last that long). By the time the `explanation' came around I'd long since given up caring about ANY of the characters and whether they were real, unreal, alive, dead, dreaming, conscious or unconscious.Crowe's too workmanlike a director to be able to invest the movie with any sense of the strange or the surreal. The characters exist in separate vacuums, talking TO each other but failing to connect. Penelope Cruz's performance is a big disappointment. In exactly the same way that Renee Zellweger's `cute' mannerisms eventually grate in `Jerry Maguire', so too do Cruz's `winsome' tics grate here.Crowe also indulges himself again regarding pop songs on the soundtrack. He's starting to use them to do the work that the script, camera and actors should. The scene with ""Good Vibrations"" is a case in point, the song completely undercuts what is happening up there on the screen.
If you looking for a movie that REALLY provokes, that truly deals with the nature of whether what you're seeing is real or not, then go see ""Memento"" and/or ""Mulholland Drive"".",Vanilla Sky

SPOILER.......... I work in HMV I served a customer the soundtrack asking her about the film was it good I thought see ruined it for me, but in the film I was so captivated that I forgot was she said until I worked it out for myself and cool it did remind me of Total Recall at the end, but better than that over the top film. Not everyones idea of a good film but personally I thought wicked, cool imagination. Its true think about it things in this, the decisions you make do change your life for better or for worse. I think this movies deserves a wonderful 4 out of 5. From the Lord of the Rings onwards so far there are good movies around.

Indeed, I had seen the original Spanish version on IFC, and was literally forced to watch the whole thing to the end to find out what really becomes of the main character.To say I was rather p***ed someone tried to remake that movie was an understatement.  But I came expecting nothing - though I hoped this might be just as good, if not better.Unfortunately, like most other 90-00s hollywood remakes, this film was rather hollow.  Sure, Cameron Crowe followed the original Abre Los Ojos exactly (rip-off might be more appropriate) - like the gutter shot, the nightclub, the post-birthday party experience (including the drawing and photos), the post-accident ""dream"" - but he added way to much meaning to the whole story.  Abre Los Ojos was just a psychological thriller, Vanilla Sky wants you to believe it will change you...My suggestion?  Find Abre Los Ojos and watch that...preferably before you see Vanilla Sky - the plot will be more entertaining.  Besides, Tom Cruise isn't as much of a 'looker' as Eduardo Noriega.",Vanilla Sky

622,jascry,Abomination,1,1 January 2003,"I've seen, and love, the original film Abre los Ojos by Alejandro Amenabar. Having seen it several times, and as an actor, I can comment on how well constructed every moment of the film is.  The story is constructed to keep you constantly wondering what exactly is going on from beginning to end and the acting is so perfect that the performances mimic real life. Unfortunately Vanilla Sky is but a pale reflection of the film it so shamelessly attempts to copy.By taking what is meant to be a convoluted story and overexplaining it, Cameron Crowe dulls the impact significantly and turns it into an almost unintentional comedy.  The concept is far fetched and Amenabar was well aware of that when he wrote Abre los Ojos.  Apparently Crowe felt that the only way to keep an audience interested is by attempting to tie up every loose end to the point where it becomes redundant and completely uninteresting.  We understand what is happening almost an hour before it ends so why must it be consistenly drilled home?Unfortunately the real disappointment is in the performances.  Tom Cruise is no better than a dime store version of the original's Eduardo Noriega and Penelope Cruz lacks any of the charisma she had in the original.  Also, the intentions of all of the actors are so far from how the story is designed that it ruins any impact the film could have had.  The usually excellent Jason Lee was obviously given no direction and flounders aimlessly in his character.  Cameron Diaz is so abominable that she can't, even for a moment, convince me that she is even attempting to stay in character.  Of course the fact that Crowe wrote the characters so lifelessly that they would not have been convincing regardless of who the actors were.In the end I'd highly recommend staying as far from this abomination as possible and watching the far superior Abre los Ojos.  I know this is 2 hours of my life I'll never get back so hopefully you won't have to suffer the same fate.",Vanilla Sky

It's nice to see people get up and leave the theater because they were expecting something simple and ordinary. Yeah, go see Deuce Bigalow or whatever. Leave the good movies to us. So anyway, this ranks up there with David Lynch's Mullholland Drive, and is (hopefully) indicative of where the film industry is going. I like films that bring up philosophical questions, show various interpretations of identity and delve into that ambiguous postmodern paradigm.

Mondo '77, can't stop playing it, sweet.How it's played: Cruise and Cruz, excellent. Diaz, won me over as Mary. Jason, you are not a sidekick, nor did you act like one, good job. Goofy guy with a name I don't remember, but are essential to the story, well played as the weird guy who's important in the end. Finally, Kurt Russel, just watched StarGate again, DO MORE DRAMA, surprisingly you can pull it off, excelent work all of you.Overall: An original remake? Confused? Why not? With all the stuff happening nowadays, a little escape to the cinema to see some more escapage (new word, use it), go for it. You will not be dissapointed.

Cameron Diaz is tremendous in the film, a vast upgrade on Nuria of ""Abre"".  I was amazed that Crowe was able to set such a different tone with ""Vanilla Sky"".

639,thindi,Definitely disturbing and bizarre but good aspects,5,29 December 2001,"It took me a while to understand why those who viewed it before me said Vanilla Sky was bizarre but by the end I totally agreed.   The fact that Tom Cruise's character is such an unlikeable guy is a testament to his acting.  His portrayal of a wounded, tormented man was very good.  Cameron Diaz and Jason Lee were also very good.  I loved Kurt Russell as the shrink and found myself rooting for him to make a difference in the film.  Penelope Cruz has some good moments but her speech patterns detract from her lines.  It is not the accent, for I find accents appealing.  She could use a speech therapist to help her change her speech errors! It is not an erotic thriller as it is advertised but rather a very dark, bizarre, somewhat despairing film with some great performances.  I do not enjoy foul language or scenes that cause viewers to become voyeurs.   Although the sex scenes are important to the plot they were overdone. I feel conflicted by the  bizarre plot twists and darkness of this film in terms of recommending it to others.  I definitely do not recommend it to anyone under 20.  I do feel some of the performances were worth watching.  Perhaps my conflicts could be soothed if I recommend seeing it only for matinee prices!",Vanilla Sky

A thoroughly enjoyable experience, with challenges of conventional thinking worthy of a philosophy class. But, if one comes to see Vanilla Sky hoping for another stereotypical flick with Tom Cruise, of which to imitate and use for reassurance of self-esteem, you will surely be disappointed.

There are great scenes in the movie, it's a superb story (my compliments to the writer), Tom Cruise was surprisingly good and the actresses were not only beautiful but they were also acting great. Too bad that's not what I will remember a year from now. The one thing I will remember from this movie will be that it's another answer to the question of who we are and what's going on around us. It's an answer I would love and hate. The only reason Vanilla Sky isn't going to get a 10 out of 10 is because of the end. Not because of the questions it leaves but the dialogue between David Aames and the psychiatrist McCabe. That's a I want to say about the scene because else I would expose to much of the end.

I bought some cheap chicken breasts to eat while watching the movie, and it failed to improve the experience as a whole. Self-centered Tom Cruise plays himself in this film; a spoilt cocky daddy's boy who pauses in front of the camera with his fake smile. The film fails in any attempt to improve what was already a weak ending in the original,and with this in mind why bother remaking the film at all???

I remember at the time sitting through 4/5ths of the movie dumbfounded at how absolutely brilliant it was. In fact, I hadn't watched it since and forgot how absolutely perfect everything seemed to be. The dialogue, the cinematography, the casting.Of course, in the theatre, after being absolutely blown away for 4/5ths of the film (which had reached a fever pitch with the smothering of the truelovestalker) I found the ending was a real let down. It appeared to come out of nowhere and serve no other purposed other than to throw the first 4/5ths of the film back in your face. The old ploy: ""Oh. It was all a dream"". Whatever.Well, I watched it again last night, for the first time. Yeah. The ending ties up all the loose ends. Accurately, correctly, and properly. I missed it the first time because I was too busy being dumbfounded at the relationships and the dialogue to realize that things weren't quite normal in David's world. When things started unraveling in the second act, I thought he was a psychological mess. Then I saw all the clues re: LE, etc. But I still didn't appreciate that seemingly anti-climactic ending.Well, first impressions aren't always right. The ending wasn't anti-climactic. It was more unexpected. And, because of that, difficult to absorb on that first viewing. Anyway, if you've only seen it once, and weren't quite sure what to think, watch it again.

I normally don't like Hollywood remakes, nor am I a big fan of Tom Cruise, but I have to say, I really liked this movie. It is haunting and beautiful, and after seeing the original ABRE LOS OJOS, it is clear to me that Crowe did a great job. The original is far less efficient than the remake, and believe it or not, I found VANILLA SKY to be less melodramatic. Also, Penélope Cruz's character is more present and complex in VANILLA SKY. The photography is breathtaking and I loved the music (although it does seem as if Cameron Crowe just threw in all his favorite songs on a CD and pressed 'shuffle'... it's more of a playlist than a real score).This said, VANILLA SKY is not to be missed. You can question the relevance of making the same movie twice (it's almost a shot by shot copy of the original, and many lines are the same), but to me VANILLA SKY is a great improvement over ABRE LOS OJOS. The only element that remains as flawed as in the original, is the vacuous and insignificant character of the best friend (Jason Lee/Fele Martínez).I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",Vanilla Sky

The other main actors, including Cruz and Diaz were well done, but not good enough to keep Cruise's performance from sinking the ship.The ending of this movie is left *way* too wide open, and I hated this.

658,costia_ullens,"""Abre los ojos"" for dummies.",2,15 April 2011,"Though Vanilla Sky is not a bad movie per se, it is on the other hand a terrible remake of a great movie. We can see how Crowe tried to stick to Amenábar's screenplay scene by scene, how he tried to make an identical movie but shot in the U.S. with Hollywood stars. A pointless idea to start with, but never mind. We also can see how Crowe got lost pretty soon.The characters lost their depth and complexity. They all come out with one trait only. Crowe succeeded in making the originally charming and fascinating girls look like teenage cheerleaders. Don't even get me started on the male characters. The dialogues lost their sharpness and delicacy ; the original meaningful calm scenes and silences were replaced by hysterical shouting, maybe to make it easier to the public to understand when someone is not happy. The relationship between the characters has also been damaged. This comes first as a result of the simplified-minded characters, but also as facts : for example, Crowe unbalances the forces between the two main male characters who were originally childhood friends by making one the employee of the other.But, well, the original genius plot stays, and I can see why so many people loved that film. Nevertheless I think many of those people would change their mind if they watched the original ""Abre los ojos"" masterpiece. Remaking a film is worthy if it aims to adapt a basic plot to a whole other context, in order to give it a new standpoint, new insights. This is not the case. I felt I was watching ""Abre los ojos"" for dummies.",Vanilla Sky
659,udkyle,Why people dislike this movie...,8,4 December 2003,"I for one really like this movie for some reasons I'll go into late but I want to touch on why I think people don't like it. First off, there are people out there who just like to hate Tom Cruise. I don't understand it really. Second, Cameron Crowe I think successfully p***es off two groups of movie-goers with this film. The casual, relaxed, ""not looking to think too hard"" group of movie-goers are left confused when the plot takes a complete 180 at the end of the movie. And the deep, philosophical, mystery-fans are devastated when Crowe has one of his characters completely explain the mystery.This is a good movie. And Tom Cruise does a very good job in it. I think it's probably his best performance from what I've seen all though I haven't seen all of his movies, or even a majority of them probably. The supporting cast is good as well. Penelope Cruz gives a solid performance and Jason Lee was enjoyable.I like the story, and I think that's what Vanilla Sky is more than anything. It's a mystery, an adventure, and a romantic comedy, but it's mostly just a good story. And it has a lot of philosophical undertones to it, and many similar ideas and stories like this occur in historical philosophy. David Aames (Cruise) is the man that had everything he wanted, more or less lost it, was given a second chance with a catch to regain it all back, and in the end facing his demons and the full scope of what is happening, chooses reality, simplicity, and normality to see if he can finally find the one thing he could never get a grip on: happiness.Many people were disappointed that Crowe laid out the complete mystery at the end. I think it's necessary. The audience then knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that David is aware of his circumstances and it makes the choice at the end all the more powerful.And the music in the movie is great. It's probably what makes the movie as enjoyable as it is. Particularly, ""Njosnavelin"" by Sigur Ros, which is an amazing song.All in all, I'd give it 3 out 4 stars. It's a movie with some substance for those who like to think things through, and a great story for those looking to relax. That ""moderate"" approach is probably why people dislike it so much because it isn't a full blown mystery, or a full blown love story. It mixes and matches different elements and genres.",Vanilla Sky
660,udkyle,Having re-watched it last night...,8,13 June 2004,"Vanilla Sky still is one of the better movies I've seen in recent years. I will note for the record that I have not seen ""Abre Los Ojos,"" but I think I'm going to check it out after thisThere are several reasons I enjoy this movie. One, the acting. Yes, the acting. I'm sorry, but Tom Cruise actually does a very good job in this movie. Cruise is not a great actor in general, but he's seems perfectly suited for the David Aames role (draw whatever conclusions you want about Tom from that.) and does a very good job in what is by far his best performance to date. Penelope Cruz is very charming as Sofia Serrano because she's basically the antithesis of David Aames, but plays it in a very warm and cute way. Kurt Russell, Cameron Diaz, Jason Lee, Timothy Spall, and Noah Taylor are all worth mentioning. It is an outstanding supporting cast.The greatest asset of the movie is the music. From Nancy Wilson's score to the songs chosen, it is flawless. Cameron Crowe uses the music of this film not just to set mood, but as a story telling device which works very well.This is definitely a movie that needs to be watched twice. Once to learn the story, and once (or more times if you like it) to pick up on the detail. Some feel that Cameron babies the audience being to obvious with he clues in this mystery, but I think the fact that there are four legitimate interpretations (according to Cameron on the DVD commentary) means that the audience is given a chance to fill in blanks with their imagination.There is a pocket of negative reaction that swirls around this film and I want to address that. First, much of it comes from people who saw and loved Abre Los Ojos. This is expected. If you've seen Abre Los Ojos before Vanilla Sky, I don't fault you for not liking Vanilla Sky. 99% of remakes never live up to the original in the viewer's mind. I myself have not seem ALO. Second, there is a certain number of people who just dislike Tom Cruise. Understandable to an extent, but try to go into a movie with an open mind. Third, I think some people went into this thinking, ""Feel-good, romantic comedy with some action spliced in"" and came out completely surprised by what this movie really jumped in to. This is the fault of Crowe and the marketing. Unless you saw ALO and knew this was a remake, it's understandable how some people were disappointed. Fourth, it's a movie that takes some time. Not everyone wants that. Many want instant gratification.All told, I like this movie very much. The music's incredible, the acting is very good. 9 out of 10 is my rating. Both those who like Vanilla Sky and those who were disappointed with the fact that Cameron has his Edmund Ventura character explain much of the plot at the end would do well in checking out Donnie Darko, a somewhat similar movie in genre with much more subtlety. Still, Vanilla Sky deserves it's due as a good movie.",Vanilla Sky

The first time I saw this film I watched it from mid-point and got drawn in. If a film can do this then you know it's a keeper.Not being a Tom cruise fan myself automatically makes me sceptical about films with him starring; however this film suits his acting style perfectly. In other words you love to hate him. The plot is clever and well thought out. You do have to pay attention through the film to make sure you stay on track. The love story is good and not over the top, and you feel real emotion throughout the film. Cameron Diaz also fits her character well and it's nice to see her play a straight role rather than a comedy. There are some high powered emotional scenes with language that will shock you but also draw you in.One of the reasons I love this film is the soundtrack. The music in any film can literally make or break it for me. This film has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. The music fills you with emotion and I found myself buying many of the tracks from the film after I watched it.The ending really shows how clever it is, leaving you with a satisfied warm feeling inside.

I saw this before the original movie and after i saw ""open your eyes"" i liked vanilla sky even more the reason is that for vanilla sky they took the good idea and made it better, to my mind perfect. ""open your eyes"" seemed incomplete to me, in ""vanilla sky"" the story is because of everything being good more touching, more intensive. first the acting is much better. OK, penelope was in ""open your eyes"", too, but i think of tom cruise, cameron diaz and especially Jason lee and kurt russel. in addition to the acting the whole scenery is appreciable: the opening scene or the poster of the vanilla-colored sky... you can feel that this movie got a bigger budget. at least the soundtrack is beautiful, one of the best in my opinion. ""vanilla sky"" owes ""open your eyes"" many parts of a good story: the rising action to the climax changes the movie from a love story to an exciting thriller, which ending touches every time, especially because of the fantastic music of sigur ros and the beautiful vanilla sky, which is to my mind well chosen. the painting by monet is my favourite after first seeing the movie.

668,OutThere129,A symbolic movie that makes the viewer think,10,2 May 2005,"When I saw this movie for the first time there was only one thing I could say after watching this film: Wow! There are two types of movies out there, 1.) a movie that you watch just to be entertained. If this is the type of movie you are looking for, then don't watch this movie, because while the story is easy to follow and it is highly entertaining, you will be challenged to think after viewing.2.) a movie that challenges the viewer to think on an intellectual level. This is a more rare type of movie, and my personal favorite. As you have probably noticed, these movies get terrible reviews and are soon forgotten. This group includes ""Instinct"" and ""Sphere"" While Tom Cruise goes through the whole recalling past thing and thinking that his face is disfigured the movie portrays how we recall the occasional bad thing from life and manifest it upon ourselves to be a ""dominating"" part or our lives. In the end we discover that this horrible mutation we have brought ourselves to believe is us simply is a dream. The leap from the building symbolizes the awakening from our manifestation and progress into a later part of our life. On a simpler level, viewers are proposed with the idea that life as we know it is a dream and that perhaps this interaction with others is a construct developed by our own comatose state in order to keep us rational.The thing that makes this movie different from others in its group is while ""Instinct"" challenges the idea of reform in our ways of life, and ""Sphere"" challenges the idea of manifested self-destruction, ""Vanilla Sky"" challenges the idea of our outlook on life and how we manifest our past traumas onto ourselves to destroy ourselves.",Vanilla Sky
669,blackmajor,A cover to cover Fear!,6,22 November 2005,"After Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous and Jerry Maguire, guess he had only Tom on his mind, who plays David Aames, as a spoilt Rich brat who inherits New York's Super seller Magazine named ""Rise"" The Movie begins in the streets with his Black Ferrari, where he sees the entire Times Square Empty!!! The best part I always wanted to hear the Directors commentary, when I got my own DVD, I heard it, right from the Producer that how it took them to Block the Entire Times Square - with the Mayor's permission all the shops and offices to be open but no living beings on site, it was physically made and no Digital mix or any graphics was used!! Really unbelievable shot!!! I heard they closed the shot in 3.5 hrs. Drawing the attention towards the accident that changed the life of this rich brat which made him feel incompetent in his life. His charms, smile and happiness were stolen by that single accident for which he gave himself. Another point to note  The sticker on David's car reads 2/30/01, a fictional date. On the commentary, Cameron Crowe says that it was an accident, it did make sense..the make up was sketched perfectly that how one could not face even his best friend and was wearing a mask for a party, even one would feel that in-composite. Also his love Sofia (Penelope Cruz) whom he visualizes as Julie (Cameroon Diaz) when he is in the ecstasy of making love with his girlfriend Sofia, who then turns in to Julie due to the strong subconscious mind taken over - is perfectly depicted by nice camera work! Although a lone character which brings his father's senses to him through Dr.Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell) who wants to reveal him to the world what he went through, but Kurt Russell rides to the conclusion that he was not under any pressure but with science and its re-engineering or moreover a treatment, from Life Time a sci-balance program which makes him feel young even after 150 yrs as such  this is where the Director had to maintain his story but then takes as a tour and summarizes the climax on top of a building with a get together to prove that he has to come over his greatest fear ""Height"" and jumps! Well this is something, which the Dir could have emitted  I would rate this movie 6 out of 10 also a must see for Tom's performance.",Vanilla Sky
670,jcwolvie2001,Casting comments,9,9 August 2005,"To anyone who says that Cruise was miscast in this role, I strongly disagree. It was his stereotypical and flashy good looks that made this role so right for him. It strengthens the story of a man who has a perfect life taken away from him. To see Cruise vulnerable and broken was refreshing, and i believe he portrayed this character very well....But to offer a different role that was miscast, Sophia. I don't see much beauty and attraction in Penelope Cruz, and at the risk of sounding shallow, if you are going to make a story about a man who is driven by infatuation of a women to , ultimately, his death..make the chick hot...some may disagree with that but that's how i saw it.",Vanilla Sky
671,aaron111,It's not all explained,9,7 June 2008,"Many will criticize this film for being too bizarre, too pretentious, too confusing. On the other end of the spectrum there will be those that will criticize it for showing us it's hand far too clearly and tying things up too neatly and conveniently. I just want to chime in and respond to all those who are disappointed by the ending - believing it's a let down because it apparently holds your hand through a complete explanation of what preceded and dispels all the intrigue and enigma that has been building. If you watch the film again more carefully - with extra attention to the first scene and the first lines of dialog we hear, you're perspective will probably change. Sprinkled throughout are subtle clues that the ending is not necessarily telling us the truth.I think Cameron Crowe has done something quite clever with Vanilla Sky - he has given us a enigmatic dreamscape of a film capped by what is apparently an easy and direct explanation. This will (in theory) quiet at least some of the dissatisfaction of a mainstream audience desiring closure and answers and a ""happy ending"" or sorts. But if you look deeper you will find that the ending, rather than being an explanation, only complicates the mystery.I must admit I avoided seeing this movie for years simply out of dislike for Tom Cruise - I shouldn't have. He perfectly embodies the essence of this character. Cameron Diaz, and especially Penelope Cruz are also perfect in their roles. Penelope Cruz also stared in the original Spanish version of this film - Abre los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). I recommend watching the original if you like Vanilla Sky - it is definitely a strong film in it's own right - but I can honestly say I much prefer Cameron Crowe's version. As critic Richard Roeper put it: if Abre los Ojos is the acoustic version, Vanilla Sky is the symphony. Every scene seems to be packed with more detail and multiple layers of meaning, and the characters are painted with so much more shading and nuance. This was one story that benefited from the Hollywood treatment - the cinematography is fittingly sweeping and epic and the soundtrack is characteristically Cameron Crowe - that is to say perfect - right down to the opening scenes backed by Radiohead's ""Everything in It's Right Place"", which sets the tone perfectly. That ambiguity and interpretability I described is barley present in Abre los Ojos, if at all. In the end I don't really find myself left questioning if everything is as it appears to be. Vanilla Sky is a movie that has grown on me over time and with repeated viewings, but even after the first time I saw it I immediately had that dizzying feeling of mixed emotions, and a palpable inability to get it out of my head that only happens when you've just witnessed something approaching a masterpiece.",Vanilla Sky

Ever since I saw this movie in previews i always thought it looked interesting, and sure enough it was. Amazing directing and acting, a little bit too long i must say, they could have cut down the script by about a half hour(it seemed a little bit delayed in certain scenes in terms of action), but amazing script. Truly laden with Jungian imagery such as the lucid dreaming, and the masks representing the lack of identity. Movies like this are why i watch them in the first place. I'll count this one in the annals of such greats as mulholland dr. or lost highway, or donnie darko(different yet still the same in terms of depth). The ending, even though it was a little bit transparent, and the writing tending to reveal the plot, still didn't faze me. Some movies are just great like that.",Vanilla Sky

Spoiler alert!!! read only if you have seen or don't plan to watchI like the fact that as a viewer it challenges you to not judge David by his new disfigured face, why yesterday he was so charming and attractive the lines he said where so witty and now he seems so pathetic trying to impress Sofia with the same lines and you see Sofia feeling sorry for him and disgusted by his disfigurement and as a viewer you really hate yourself for feeling the same...so dose Sofia. now that is real strong stuff when we are given a mirror to how shallow we really are...how we judge looks...made me quite upset about myself. The movie is about the mind trying to make it alright again. To fix the shatrerd realty like in dreams..its gets out of control...poor David his character is so tragic i cried so much for him at the end...such a sad tragic masterpiece. I did see the original Spanish film its was not as philosophical as vanila sky and tom cruse really can act and has a tender soul. It comes through.

Crowe fan - but he needs to stick to originals. I saw Abre Los Ojos first, though it's been almost a year since I saw it. I'd been avoiding Vanilla Sky because I'd heard awful things about it. I just caught it on cable.Overall, not *that* bad. I thought Jason Lee was great, Cameron Diaz once again plays the psycho well (Very Bad Things was a very bad movie, ha ha, but she shone in it as a psycho as well.) Tom Cruise was Tom Cruise (eh), and Penelope Cruz is so much better in Spanish films, but I could deal with her here much better than in Blow. I still like the story - if you have a problem with suspension of disbelief, avoid this as well as the original. It was true to the original at least in that much.The bad parts: A little too long, a little slow, and some rather bad choices in musical moments. (I like most of the music chosen, but they didn't always fit well into the scenes. It was almost as if someone was just trying to point out how much they knew about music...) The biggest problem I have with it though is only in comparison to the original. Crowe over-explains the whole thing. I don't remember there being that long of an ending in the original - there was explanation, but it didn't take as long to explain somehow... I think it was dumbed down a bit, maybe as a reaction to what the American audiences tend to want. It was almost insulting - you could figure out what the next sentence was going to be, what the explanation for each element was (trying really hard to avoid spoilers here) before they actually got to it. After they explain the splice - there's really not much more that you have to have spelled out. Though maybe with having seen the original, that's just how it feels...Anyway - 6 out of 10. Not great, but not awful either. Better watched on a lazy Sunday evening on cable than having paid for any of it... :)",Vanilla Sky

I figured they would explain it all at the end...nope.  I mean, come on, if you had a chance to ""splice"" into your life to change how things went, would you choose the life that happened after the horribly disfiguring accident, or would you have been smart and ""spliced"" into just before you get into the car with the psycho who will disfigure you?  No idea of what is a dream and what is real, and then there are dreams within the dream...?

To me everything was completely resolved (some reviewers felt it was OVER-EXPLAINED, but I didn't mind it because it certainly helped ME understand it).The thing is, the Life Extension and Lucid Dreams mumbo jumbo were simply vehicles for the writer to express his central ideas.  That of Consequence. That the ""little things are the big things.""  The tiniest decision we make (getting in the car) can have a profound impact on our future.  That may sound bleak, but at the same time it is enveloped by the other, this one positive, idea that ""every minute of your life is a chance to turn things around.""  The film was able to show these ideas very powerfully, to great effect.When, at the end of the film, it mentioned ""that one night when true love was a possibility"" and then showed David (Cruise) hesitate and eventually get into Julie's (Diaz) car...it was extremely sad.Another idea repeated in the film was the question ""what is happiness to you?""  Simple question, but extremely difficult to answer.  And if one can't answer it, how can he be happy?It seems like many recent films have been questioning our concept of reality - Being John Malkovich, Fight Club, The Matrix, Vanilla Sky, Memento (tangentially).Vanilla Sky is a thought provoking, discussion initiating film, with a powerful message.

Lots of good stuff old and new.  Many striking scenes to go with the music.  Peter Gabriel's ""Solsbury Hill"" is one of my favorites.  Unfortunately the dialogue obscured most of the lyrics (granted, they didn't have much to do with the plot, but as a fan I wanted to hear the song).This may be a SPOILER but the film reminded me of ""Total Recall"" and ""Dark City""--the sci fi elements were perhaps a little unwelcome.

Looking for SOMETHING a group of six friends could go to this weekend in San Diego, I nixed our seeing Sidewalks of New York as I'd heard it was endlessly talkative, and foolishly suggested we try Vanilla Sky instead. Well, some of our group thought this movie the worst in years. More boring than House of Mirth, more absurd than Eyes Wide Shut, more obscure than Memento and more embarrassing than Quills, we suffered to the end. When I couldn't take it, I looked at the floor or audience. Cruise's toothy smile is bad enough but his distorted car crash mask is harder to take. Penelope Cruz seemed vacuous--supposedly better in the Abre Los Ojos original, which I've not seen. Kurt Russell as a shrink is a joke, and only Cameron Diaz seemed adequately cast, though she's not on camera long enough. (For charisma, she easily trumps Penelope Cruz.) Plot motivation is thin, the music's an arbitrary rock hodgepodge, editing is MTV-style, and the film's muddled concept perhaps appealed to Cruise due to his belief in Scientology. 1 out of 10.",Vanilla Sky

694,veovisjohn,A Complete Butchery of Abre Los Ojos,1,27 January 2002,"The absolute most annoying thing about this film is that some people think it is so `original.'  The entire film is a re-make of a highly superior film from Spain called Abre Los Ojos.  As a matter of fact, re-make is too nice a word.  I would say it is a shameless destruction of another person's ideas. This person is Alejandro Amenábar, the Spanish director who recently made The Others.  The film Abre Los Ojos was made only a few years ago, hardly warranting a re-make.  Abre Los Ojos is original, entertaining and well made, with far less of a budget than Vanilla Sky.Now Cameron Crowe has taken this excellent film and literally destroyed everything great about.  The plot is needlessly lengthened to the point of absurdity.  Tom Cruse shows off his usual inability to deliver any sort of quality whatsoever (the only time I've ever seen him do anything worth watching was in Magnolia).  The ending is given a ridiculous happy spin and is dragged out.  The only person remotely worth watching in this film is Jason Lee, who actually does his part justice beyond the actor in the original.In the past, when Cameron Crowe has worked with material of his own, the results have not been too bad.  However, as Crowe attempts to show, or should I say steal another persons story, he fails miserably.  The film is injected with pop songs and references.  Okay I get it Crowe.  So, if you put a bunch of songs that people like, you think some of that quality will rub off onto your film?  Keep dreaming.  The songs are placed horribly and have almost nothing to do with what occurs.  It is not like in Rushmore, where the songs seem to match the mood of the scene.  In Vanilla Sky, the Beach Boy's `Good Vibrations' blasts through the speakers while Tom Cruse runs around all confused.  Oh yeah, Beach Boys.  That's exactly what I think of when I'm having a nervous breakdown.Trying to re-create Abre Los Ojos the way Cameron Crowe does is like attempting to draw a beautiful work of art with an Etch-A-Sketch.  It looks terrible and probably should not be attempted in the first place.  The penalty for stealing in some countries is to have your hands cut off.  If this sentence were carried out with Cameron Crowe, he would be getting off lightly.",Vanilla Sky

I just saw this film yesterday, and I am still effected by its twists and turns.  Crowe's direction constantly kept my attention and always had me guessing about what was going to happen next. My only complaint about the film is the ending, which dragged about 20 minutes too long and basically walked the viewer through the previous two hours of the film.  Too much was explained and that took away from the surprise ending.Tom Cruise was also exceptional in the film.  He takes the hopelessness he had as a Vietnam vet in ""Born on the Fourth of July"", combines it with his paranoid character in ""The Firm"", and the smoothness of Maverick in ""Top Gun"", and creates an awesome dynamic character.

Think about it: the voice saying Open Your Eyes at the end; didn't it sound an awful lot like Penelope Cruz's voice? Is it possible that after he passed out on the pavement, the movie from there on in was a dream not from LE, but from being drunk and passed out on the pavement? Or maybe, they sent him back into the dream without his consent. Or, maybe it was just what it seemed: it was an LE employee's voice and not Penelope Cruz's. or--just possibly--The entire movie was a dream and he'd never even met Penelope Cruz's character, but was still with Cameron Diaz (sorry I can't use the characters name's, but I can't remember them right now and I don't feel like going back to get them.) DO NOT take anything at face value; also, was it just me, or was the color green a theme? they crashed through a green railing, there was green in practically every shot of the opening dream, the lasers at the night club were green and blue, and I got too involved in the story to notice other appearances, but I'm pretty sure they were there.END OF SPOILERSI think I'm probably going to have to see this movie about 15 more times to get all the themes and meanings in this movie.

Trust me; you'll be glad you did.",4,7 November 2004,"This film had such potential, but it failed in the end because it gave the viewers far too little credit. This should have been an existential, philosophical, psychological thriller, and up until about the last ten minutes, it was. But rather than let the viewer try to figure out what's going on, rather than force the viewer to open his mind to the possibilities of multiple realities and to answer the questions of identity and sanity and reality raised in the first two hours of the film, it succinctly and in unremarkable language explains what was going on the whole time. This kind of convenient resolution is all too common in ""suspense"" movies (see also, Training Day(2001); Arlington Road (1999)) and is dissatisfying to people who actually want to interpret the film. It is typical of filmmakers who are unwilling to take a chance, namely that their film will be misunderstood. Of course when suspense is well done (see, Memento(2000); Usual Suspects, The(1995); Birth(2004)), the filmmaker need not worry whether his intentions were communicated. The end of Vanilla Sky, and thus the film as a whole, is a symptom of the trend among timid screenwriters to rely on a dubious plot device to make sense of an otherwise weak script. The real tragedy in this case is that the film would likely have been much stronger without this device.",Vanilla Sky
703,dhw377-1,Superb Movie,10,9 August 2002,"A highly enjoyable ""drama"" that really is something else in disguise. It has an absolutely fascinating story that, for once in a long time, left me wondering what was going to happen next. I never knew what was happening, or what was going to occur next. It's a mysterious, fun, surreal, mystifying, and highly enjoyable movie. It's definitely not an action movie. Highly celebral. I most recommend it with a 10 rating! Fantastic acting and directing. Cameron Crowe made the movie light and comical, and then he would twist it around and make it dark and surreal. Go see it now! :)",Vanilla Sky
704,annenk38,A horrible remake,3,29 December 2001,"Several cultural nuances damage this americanized version of Abre Los Ochos beyond all hope.  First, the cast chosen is roughly 10 years too old for their roles.  In the original film, all characters were of the college age. Evidently, preserving this element would have introduced its own problems and cultural nuances.  Younger actors would have had to act a bit more maturely than would be appropriate for their age.  Therefore the directors have resorted to this trick of selecting older actors, which have resulted in an unfaithful, inauthentic adaptation.  And it is reflected in the quality of the acting and in the awkwardness of the dialogue.",Vanilla Sky

Dear me, there must be an awful lot of spiderman, tranformers loving mindless idiots who 'just don't get it'. Jesus, grow a brain.Like many of the people I can see have rated this movie, I agree, it touched me deeply on a personal level, like no other, perhaps with the exception of Shawshank. The scene between Cruise and Cruz where they draw each other to Peter Gabriel's 'solisbury hill' is beautiful.There is too much to say about the genius of this film.

708,joelknight,wonderful multilayered existential morality play,10,16 December 2001,"GO SEE THIS MOVIE.  Cameron Crowe has done it again.No spoilers, but Crowe does a fantastic job of weaving a multilayered existential morality play onto the screen.  The visual design of the movie is breathtaking, and Tom Cruise really excels under Crowe's direction. Cameron Diaz turns in a powerhouse supporting performance, proving yet again how underrated she is as an actor.The best thing I can say about this film is that it will probably haunt me for months and months to come.  Some critic's have been knocking Crowe's use of music in the film, saying it distracts or disrupts the narrative flow. These people are what I like to call ""wrong.""  Crowe has infused warmth and heart into this story, and the music is part of the compass the film gives you.  You feel for these characters so much.  It is genuinely chilling, thrilling and heart-rending throughout the story's unfolding.",Vanilla Sky
709,beegee3079,If one more user implies that I just 'don't get' this movie...,1,14 January 2002,"Let's get one thing straight here; this film was made for Tom Cruise's ego. They spent a lot of money on it, pulled in an acclaimed director, and even photocopied an English translation of a previously acclaimed film's script. It couldn't fail could it?Well it did.  There are NO brilliant social observations in this movie, the whole life extension thing was NOT a vehicle for the people behind this film to display some sort of deeper meaning or commentary about society (it was just a failed plot device), and all it managed to do was lower Cruise and Crowe's standing in the eyes of many critics, both professional and amateur, all over the world.Cruise has shown many times that he can act, for examples just see 'Born on the Fourth of July' or 'Magnolia' and Crowe can most certainly piece together a worthwhile film, i.e. 'Almost Famous,' but both should walk off with their tails between their legs after this one.The 'suprise' ending, which some have even compared to the one in 'the Sixth Sense,' is just a ridiculous.  The ending in M. Night Shyamalan's film was signposted throughout the film and relied on clever camera work, scripting, and editing to hide the secret.  It was done in a clever fashion and all fitted in quite neatly. THIS film just added a completely contrived and stupid ending without giving any sort of hint as to what might happen earlier (unless you count the constant references to that snap frozen dog). You could put the exact same ending on a film about the life of Martin Luther King and it would fit just as well as it does in this one.Now you may have noticed that it's the ending that I am complaining about in particular. In all honesty, the first hour or so of the film is an effective scene setter.  Yes, Cruise only shows one emotion before the accident and another vaguely modified one afterwards, but Cameron Diaz and Kurt Russell offer impressive performances and it often feels as though Vanilla Sky is just on the verge of blowing your mind and becoming film of the year. Then comes the ending.Yes, a few good performances and a good first hour might seem to be justification for giving the film some credit (at least more than I'm about to give it) but that only adds insult to injury when the aforementioned STUPID second half kicks in.  Don't worry if you didn't like this film while others you know loved it and claim that any smart person would like it; you are right.  They have just been caught up in the pretentiousness that this film carries with it from start to finish. The fact the IMDB users have given this drivel such a high score just proves the phrase 'there's no accounting for taste.'3/10 Tops.  Maybe less, but Diaz and Russell and the impressive start give it SOME credence.",Vanilla Sky
710,diegoval,Not bad remake,8,7 February 2002,"I think this is a good remake from the original ""Open your eyes"",but I can't understand why Cameron Crowe has photocopied most of the scenes...What a little imagination¡¡¡Apart from that, the best of the movie are the great acting, everybody is better than in the original(except Tom Cruise,Eduardo Noriega was much better in the Spanish version)and for the American audience and critics who talk about the bad performances of Penelope Cruz, I recommend them all the Spanish filmography of this excellent actress...she's superb¡¡¡¡¡",Vanilla Sky

This film works in many ways, but more shocking than anything is the way it works in a way where films of its type have attempted in the past, but nothing as surreal but decipherable as Crowe's enterpettion. There are some extremely emotionally unsettling moments in this film, I actually found myself looking away because of how effective its platform and performances were. You need to see this movie.

It is unfortunate Amercia's #1 box office draw and acclaimed director Cameron Crowe couldn't put together a better film. I can't help but remember the last time Tom Cruise fell in a love with a co star, a bad film was the end result. Nicole Kidman was the actress and Far and Away was the very forgetteable film. Almost ten years later a new love blossoms and a bad film is the end result.This film is has very confusing themes, Fatal Attraction meets Memento meets Jacob's Ladder. Director Crowe attempts at the very last minute to bring everything together, but ion the meantime leaves the viewer bewildered and lost. All of the actors turn in good performances, but the writing and direction fall way short. The film never hits it's stride and seems clumsy from the start. The soundtrack is one of the promising elements of this film.",Vanilla Sky

I wish I had stayed in bed now.Not that this starts off as a bad film.  In fact it is rather good.  That is why the ending, which irked me at first, has played on my mind and grown into a disappointment of ""Godzilla"" proportions.  Ok, it's not THAT bad but I still feel like I should be compensated for sitting all the way through this soul-less exercise in vanity.Yes, the opening dream sequence is very good and eerie.  Yes Cameron Diaz is excellent as the bitter and consequently twisted Julie, even Penelope Cruz does the cute little girlie act rather well.  Tom Cruise does Tom Cruise and Jason Lee does his patented 'token best friend' gig.  But, silly me thought there might be a point to the film.  Maybe a comment on the futility of a playboy lifestyle, a reflection on the consequences of badly treating another person for your own selfish whims.  I thought the sheer eighties shallow Yuppiness of Tom Cruise's character would have some reason.  But no, it's all a cinematic set up -true, you couldn't see it coming and when it hits you in the face the first thing to pop into your head is ""ohhhhhhhh I get it.....but...so what?"".I just hated the last half hour of this film so much.  Unlike Fight Club, it completely negates what you have seen before thus giving me the impression that it has wasted some of my life.  I don't take kindly to this sort of time-stealing hence the low, low mark I gave it, which was 2, one mark for Diaz, the other...actually I should have just given it one!",Vanilla Sky

If you are looking for a 'mind bending' film that knows what it is doing, rent something like ""BRAZIL.""  Vanilla Sky is a travesty in the worst of all senses.  It is a pseudo art film, so disjointed, it is barely coherent. As for the idea of the film...interesting to a point-but remember that is only an idea.  An idea should not carry an entire film-thus I can spew out words such as: gimmicky and pretentious. As for the pop culture references, does the word subtly mean anything? What was the point Cameron Crowe was trying to make?  That we live in a world over run by products, or products over rule us or products over rule our main character.  That nonsense was completely extraneous to the barely visible story. As for the ending...OH MY GOD!!!  Here's an idea: lets make a film that is incomprehensible and pass it off as a thinking film.  Nothing in this film has to though about-it doesn't cohere to anything.  The ending sums up the entire barrage of sequences that make up 3/4 of the film.  So what is there to think about?  It is right there.  This is just another way to treat idiotic audience members.  Of course I have no problem with people liking even the most awful of movies, but when people can't decipher what is a masterpiece from just another movie, that is a problem.

The movie kept me very interested, with each scene I was trying to paste the movie together, and with each scene it seemed I came to a diffrent conclusion as to what was really happening.  The ending explained a lot of what I already had figured out byt hat point so it made the ending feel a bit too long.  I think the film would have been better without the ""walkthrough of the plot"" ending.  Those that needed it to understand the plot probably were those that left the theatre early or those that looked confused throughout, but those are the people that had already made up their minds that the movie was horrible.

The movie: Big noisy, gaudy box. Empty inside. Hey, that's like the vain playboy/peacock David Aames. Mimics many other recent movies, but is as superficial as its protagonist. It's an uninteresting and dishonest puzzle that says nothing new. Style over substance.The philosophy: ""The sweet isn't as sweet without the sour."" 4th grade Mediocrates.It's only that David never experiences the sour except in a dream. The real sourness of life drove him to suicide. (At least one scenario within this movie mess.) The movie's whole love affair was in his dream/imagination. That aint love, unless you accept the dreams of a self-centered narcissist as real love. I know there's a big draw in the idea of a perfect romantic fantasy, but Sofia wasn't even a real person, but a creation of David's imagination: a nearly blank slate and puppet of his will, since it was all his dream. Sounds perfectly sweet to me. Where do I sign?He's offered his face back and another chance in the distant future. Might not seem so fair to someone who hasn't had the bucks or technology to cure some handicap or disease. He sidesteps the hassle of having to form a persona that's not driven by a handsome face that opens doors and kills the ladies. Sounds really sweet to me. ""Look ma, no consequences!"" ""Money conquers all!""""Happiness is found in the small things in life."" Erma Bombeck? Peking Express?The only small things in this movie were the minds who conceived and executed their very small ambitions.""Open your eyes."" anonymousHe never does in this movie. David needed a spiritual awakening but got an explanatory lecture. Glenda the Good Witch of Tech Support, with all that justifying on the rooftop, was a totally unconvincing proof of David's change. A soothing lecture is a lot cheaper to pull off than portraying real character development, isn't it? Having something preached at you is no substitute for learning, accepting and owning the Truth. Seems as though he was ready to take a leap and repeat it all again. Maybe he should have been asked to open his ears to hear that ""still small voice"" instead. But with Glenda droning and the soundtrack blaring I doubt he'd have heard that either.""Maybe in another life, when we're cats."" That about says it all.",Vanilla Sky
720,rickmiller88,Best damn movie...ever!,10,8 January 2002,"This movie rocked my world!I thought Almost Famous was going to be Cameron Crowe's pinnacle. Vanilla Sky exceeded it and then some.Kevin Smith said he liked it but felt it was just an ""artsy"" Total Recall. Even Mr. Smith missed the point of this movie. This movie is all feel folks.
Cameron Crowe is the only director that can instill a feeling into a movie that stays with you. To transcend feeling as an analogy on how life should feel. He is simply amazing.Some opinionist on here say this is nothing more than a sixth sense rip-off much like Kevin Smith stated. While The Sixth Sense had its one twist, I was not compelled to watch it over and over. The Sixth Senses' wad was shot the first time around and now the film has fallen into oblivion.
Vanilla Sky with its feel will leave you wanting to see it again and again so you can feel the budding love at first sight between Cruise and Cruz. The tragedy of Cruise afterwards and the music that Mr. Crowe has chosen to drive all of it into you.This movie is not as difficult to follow as some would let on. They simply do not get anything beyond Independence Day, Rambo or American Pie. The first part is real and the second is a dream that goes wrong. I will not give up much more than that. Once you understand the movie then see it again and marvel at the brilliance that is Cameron Crowe. There is so much I caught the second time around and I imagine I will the third and ...

David Aames whole world turns around after meeting Sofia. Yes, love at first sight. He is mesmerized. That is all he is left with when he dies. All he has is the mystique of Sofia and that one night. You know, when you have that date that just goes wonderfully  and the whole sky opens up and you are on top of the world. That feeling you had. Maybe you are married now to that person. That first time feeling is gone because the mystery is gone. Well all David Aames had was the feeling and hope of that one encounter. The rest is his Lucid Dream with her..and something goes terribly wrong..in his Lucid Dream.Some of the reviews scoff at the Lucid Dream/Cryogenics theory. First, it's a movie. Tell me The Sixth Sense and Total Recall aren't a bit of a stretch. But best explained by a line from the movie itself..""they laughed at Jules Verne too""Cameron Crowe is the master at creating feeling. That good feeling of mystique.

It explains itself, and while I don't want to offer any spoilers, I didn't find the movie confusing at all.  It handled the complex plot (which turns out to be very simple) in a mysterious and very original way.After some of the horrible, terrible, monstrously awful Tom Cruise has been in recently (Mission Impossible 2), Cruise did a great job in Vanilla Sky.

Not because of his accident but for the fact that even though he has everything the one thing he lacks is true love. Penelope Cruz is beautiful and charming, she breathes life into the film with her wit and smile.  I also want to give kudos to Crowe for bringing Jason Lee back, I can never get enough of his brilliant performances.

People like to dream or even just imagine their perfect life. It is such an intense moment when that happens, that the person can't even realize whether he is dreaming or not. The new Cameron Crowe movie Vanilla Sky shows this fact in a more complicated, but sophisticated way. This movie is a remake of the Spanish movie Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes) directed by Alejandro Amenabar. It is innovative and existential; it is hard to understand, and that is what intimidated the critics who brought it down.Tom Cruise stars as rich and successful David Aames who unexpectedly finds his true love with a very pleasant Spanish lady. What becomes his problem is the fact that he loves being liked; that is what makes him enter the car of friendly-but-barmy Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) who has more than a crush on him. It is just this little mistake that ruins all of David's life. When he realizes that his life completely crumbled, all he wants is to find out one way to fix it all up. The protagonist then has to make it through a series of odd situations, some of which turn out to be just dreams. David's life is now separated into dream and reality, and when those two will end up joining in a `pause mode,' things will become clear to him.Tom Cruise produced this New York-based movie with associate Paula Wagner and writer/director Cameron Crowe (whom he has worked with in Jerry Maguire). Crowe (Jerry Maguire, Almost Famous) changes his style by giving the movie lots of more energy compared to his old works. In the middle of all this desperation, he gives it a little sarcasm making it more controversial. Penelope Cruz plays the girl of David's dreams; she gives a normal performance, nothing special. Instead, with her right energetic performance, Cameron Diaz got nominated for a Golden Globe, but didn't win it. After all the foolish comedies she has done, finally she was chosen to play a more complicated character that reflected all of her talent. Kurt Russell completed a great performance playing David Aames' psychiatrist. He might even get nominated for some award, but his part doesn't give him enough possibilities to react and give more vitality. Tom Cruise didn't do a bad job; he did too many of his ironical laughs while shaking his head. Making himself  `look bad' in this movie, might create an admiring reaction in some people.Vanilla Sky is a pretty disturbing movie while watching it, but not anymore when it has ended. It has been constructed in a way to confuse the spectator; the effect of that, is that once you have understood the whole story, you feel extremely satisfied. That is what the director wanted to accomplish; and he did.Rating: ****",Vanilla Sky

I believe many of those people who have given this movie a poor grade just don't have patience for a movie that requires a little grey matter. Misleading previews are probably to blame for disappointing a lot of people. 'Vanilla Sky' is definately in my to 50 movies(If not 30...).

To say that you need an open mind to understand this film would be an understatement, however I found the storyline refreshing as it always kept you guessing as to what may be real and what was just in the mind. Tom Cruise plays an excellent role as the play boy gone wrong! He pays for the errors of his ways but inside there is the romantic, needy man which keeps him going. Cameron Diaz shines in her psychotic role and Penelope Cruz, taking to one side her 'annoying' accent, makes the film captivating as the 'one'.

736,krnxsowhatx,Finally a different movie,8,2 December 2007,"I wanted to watch a movie that was very deep, abstract, existential, and philosophical but I couldn't find any other movies that fits into my category other than Fight Club. But when I heard that Vanilla Sky has a lot of philosophical themes I was curious enough to watch it. I burrowed this movie from block buster and saw it and I have to say that I really liked the movie. I didn't exactly understand why there were a lot of negative reviews because I thought vanilla sky was 10 times better than any average Hollywood movies. However I understand that people are not very favorable of movies without a solid conclusion, but in favor of the movie I argue that most movies these days have solid conclusions and majority of those conclusions are very unoriginal, corny, and extremely ... ""Hollywood"". Vanilla Sky ends in a way that makes the audience guess or think what the main character chose: A real life or a life of dreams. Most movie-watchers have the tendency to watch movies that requires no philosophical inquiry and would rather watch movies that are usually simple and predictable. What I'm exactly arguing for is that Vanilla Sky is one of those few movies that are actually different in a positive sense. If one simply looks at the plot of Vanilla Sky then you can't exactly appreciate it because you're excluding the idea or the theme. The theme is hard to describe because unlike most movies it's not very tangible; It's hard to grasp it all at once, you actually have to see the movie to understand what I mean. Well I explained why I found the movie significant to me, but I'll also explain why I didn't give a perfect rating. For me personally the twist in the movie didn't seem entirely realistic, it was rather some-what out of place. However the twist was necessary to convey the theme but such ""necessary evil"" has partially ruined the movie. This is probably why most reviewers disliked it, which I could understand, but as I said before the twist seemed necessary to convey the theme. A similar movie called Forgotten was even worse, the way the twist worked made it worse than the plot-twist in vanilla sky. In Vanilla sky they had a plot-twist that seemed more possible, in Forgotten the twist is a mixture of possibility and impossibility. The twist was more like one of those UFO conspiracy theories you hear now and then, which I found to be very corny. So basically yes you'll find a ridiculous plot twist in Vanilla Sky but it isn't as bad as the plot twist in other movies, Vanilla Sky uses a plot twist that is necessary to convey it's theme and I don't know any other better ways to convey the theme. It's not the best way, I admit, but what counts is that it works. Well In conclusion I have to say that I enjoyed Vanilla Sky and I enjoyed the humor and romance.",Vanilla Sky
737,Markconx,Vanilla Sky - Totally underrated. It is awesome! Well very good at least.,10,14 February 2012,"I ask the critics who rubbish this movie 'Vanilla Sky', ""Did you really watch it with open eyes?"" It's a genuine masterpiece for its plot, acting, cinematography, direction and use of music. I've watched both movies; the original ""Abre Los Ojos"" was very good, but it has an entirely different feel and isn't as dynamic as Cameron Crowe's remake which makes better use of soundtrack. The concept for me back in 2001 was innovative and still now I find the film entertaining. Everyone is welcome to their opinions but please let's have some honesty. I think the film has suffered because of prejudices towards Mr. Cruise. My favourite actress Cameron Diaz was very convincing and sexy :-) The rest of the cast also made for a good show. Bravo!",Vanilla Sky
738,Anubious,It will get you thinking on choices you make in life...,10,2 June 2002,I can't say much cause the less you know about this movie the better it actually is. The only thing I can say though is It will get you thinking on choices you make in life. This is a definite movie that will get you thinking and that is also heart warming at times. You got to pay attention to the movie very closely cause almost every word counts it just makes the movie even better. See it twice for even better enjoyment.,Vanilla Sky
739,schmuck21,What makes this movie so special. . .,10,27 May 2002,"Before one watches this movie, he or she must be aware that it can be viewed on two levels.  The first is the sci-fi aspect: special effects, visually stimulating scenes, thought-provoking plots, & technological possibilities. I feel that most people will watch this movie, and will do so only being aware of this first level, and this by no means is something negative - indeed Vanilla Sky provides interesting ideas in regards to what the future would be and could be like - however lofty and idealistic these possibilities may be.The second aspect that I feel Vanilla Sky contains, is what makes this movie so unique for me: the possibility of finding the one true love in the world. As any plot summary can describe, Vanilla Sky is about the protagonist David Aames (Tom Cruise), a man worth millions, a man who owns the largest publishing company in New York, a man who women like the beautiful Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) seemingly incessantly lust after.  Although he essentially seems to have it all, there is definitely something valuable missing - the one true love in his life.  This void is filled once he meets the kind, witty latin brunette, Sofia (Penelope Cruz).  With Sofia, David has found the one thing he has never had before - the perfect companion. Their time spent together is portrayed like a fairly-tale, and it is done so well, that the viewer can feel the perfection and the burning feelings generated by the love between them.  Fate and bad decisions hugely alter their relationship, but although things get quite crazy as Vanilla Sky progresses, the viewer (I did) may become swarmed with emotion at what really could have been for David and Sofia - the endless possibilites.All that matters regardless of the plot outcome, is that David is one of the few lucky people in this world who finds his match, and that notion in itself is something intense.  Vanilla Sky has made me hope that I will do the same at some point in my life and that I hopefully have not passed up any prior opportunities.  ""Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around."" - Carpe Diem. . . Vanilla Sky teaches that you have to live it up while you can - and if there is something you really want - go after it, because if you don't, you could miss out on something so great - like the one true love.I'm sure many of you will think that my critique is too idealistic, but this is what I feel every time I watch Vanilla Sky.  It is more than an erotic, sci-fi thriller - it is something much deeper and larger.  It shows that while money can get you far in life, true love is something hard to find - and if you do find it - you are the luckiest person in the world.",Vanilla Sky
740,jonie v,pseudo existentialism deja vu,1,7 July 2003,"just like spielberg's AI, Vanilla Sky takes up the BIG QUESTIONS of life by using futuristic tricks as a prop. this is a difficult genre to handle and the cameron crowe/tom cruise duo failed in their effort because they fell in love with themselves (just like spielberg). directing/producing/acting teams are dangerous, especially when they involve big stars who think they can get away with anything. tom cruise is a great actor, but he needs a director who reminds him that he's supposed to ACT, not simply crank up his patented charm and light up the screen. editing room, please. also, it's hard to take philosophizing about the BIG QUESTIONS seriously when tom, penelope, and cameron keep romping about.i found this film boring, pretentious, and silly.",Vanilla Sky

If the scenes that didn't happen felt a little more surreal, I may have bought the plot, but they didn't.Basically, I'm trying to make excuses for a bad, bad movie. Don't waste your time.

742,Hollis P Wood,a tad different than the original,7,9 June 2002,"After seeing both (this and the original, Open Your Eyes) in a short period of time, I can't determine which I like better....they both have their aspects primarily in the develpoment of certain lines of action.  It seems that Crowe was a lot more interested in the romantic line of action between and also Cruise's profession came into play a lot more in Crowe's adaptation.  More time was devoted to the love that was developing between Cruise and Cruz (weird) before his accident, which was good.  The story involving his job was a little cheese, but whatever.  It also lacked the same psychological element as the original...but Crowe was obviously more interested in Cruise's romantic dreams, which helped because otherwise (my ultimate point), it's the same movie.  Still good though and worth it if you like to be confused until the end.And scared, you will be Luke.7.5/10 for the nice little love story, but for lacking the psychological overtones that drove the story in the original.",Vanilla Sky

745,tobers19,Another Hollywood rip off of a genuine masterpiece,1,1 February 2008,"Those folks praising Vanilla Sky for its genius are the same folks who praise Gus van Sant for his genius film, Psycho and the same folks who think Walt Disney wrote the original stories for Pinocchio, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. Come on, folks, let's give credit where credit is due. The only fascinating elements to Vanilla Sky are those taken from the original, Abre los Ojos. Abre los Ojos is such a fine and engaging film that I thought it would be impossible to make a horrible re-make of it. Even if Cameron Crowe re-shot this movie frame by frame, he would have an excellent film on his hands. But even he managed to muck it up. Cameron Crowe is one of the most overrated 'talents' in Hollywood. An average writer and director at best, he can only warrant praise when he's riding on the coattails of a true artist like Amenabar. Don't even bother with this schlock. Watch the original. Why Hollywood has to appropriate source material like this with impunity, I will never understand. Hollywood has done this with numerous Kurosawa films, i.e. The Magnificent Seven, The Outrage and even A Fistful of Dollars, though Leone eventually earned his place as a true master. And just about every American horror movie of the last decade has been outsourced from Japan. But for hacks like Crowe who insist on casting madmen like Cruise, the making of true art seems like a futile endeavor. Who cares about the self-congratulatory cultural references throughout the film? Most of them are from Cameron's own life...referencing his wife, his wife's work and several of his own films. Fifty years from now, all these references will be lost on a generation of viewers who could either care less or are oblivious to such allusions. It's because of lackluster filmmakers like Crowe that true art seemingly will never thrive in cinema. Just because he can recognize a good film like Jules et Jim and include some obscure reference to it in his own films doesn't mean he's in the same league as Truffaut. It enrages me that Vanilla Sky even gets a single kudo. Again, why don't we just re-make the original Star Wars and call it art? Oh yeah, Lucas already did that with Episodes 1-3. Anyways, how Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise got to be so popular and bankable, I will never know. Why these two balloon-heads are generating mediocre film after mediocre film is almost as much a mystery as why people even watch them. Just look at Almost Famous. Cameron Crowe is rubbing it in your face that he's a wunderkind...a fifteen year old who hobnobs with rock stars and lost his virginity to a throng of insatiably hot groupies all the while trying to forge a cover story for Rolling Stone magazine. Let's try for once to reign cinema out of the hands of the aggressively mediocre and into the hands of daring artists. Until then, we'll just have to deal with unwatchable re-makes of true masterpieces and watch films that were created by accountants, lawyers and the hackneyed filmmakers they keep on the payroll.",Vanilla Sky
746,jonnyblairuk,A not very clever 'clever film',5,19 December 2002,"I can sum this movie up in five words; Whats all the fuss about? I sat down with real excitement to watch this but after two hours of irrelevant twists and an unshocking ending I was left feeling rather dissapointed. I think my major issue with this movie is that its just not the film it would like to think it is. Lets start with the general plot- ok, quite interesting within itself, but the ending is just so unecessary! It could have quite easily stood alone as a movie without the ending which has a feeling of being 'tagged on' just to make the film more interesting. If the notion itself was an original one I might be lenient on it but hasnt this sort of thing been done before in such supposed 'lesser' films like 'Total Recall'?. The film to me, just appears to be being clever for being clevers sake. It didn't need to be what it likes to think it is. If you haven't seen this movie, then my advice is if you are really looking for an intelligent, clever, original ending, look elswhere. Vanilla sky is alright, but it may leave you with a feeling of deja-vu or even being cheated out of a film you are lead to believe is cleverer than it really is.",Vanilla Sky

Some poeple just assume because they're was a twist ending, then it was an intellectual movie.  The movie fails if you're not at least given subtle hints to the motivation of the characters.

That was so amazing and it kept me thinking of every past scenes and I connected everything and it was really a masterpiece movie.But this one was awful lot confusing for me and I couldn't distinguish between which is dream and which is reality. At the end, one of the character, reveals the whole mystery which is not expected in such kind of movies. Still it left me with lot of gaps and I couldn't really digest it. And the climax, I didn't feel it was so dramatic and unexpected (unlike Fight Club). And I still don't understand why Tom Cruise has to fall from the skyscraper in order to get back to his real life.If you are a person who doesn't use much brains to watch a movie, then this is not recommended.

I like psychological twists and turns as well as anyone, (A Beautiful Mind was terrific), and sci-fi as well (The Matrix), but this was just annoying. I never got to a point where I cared about any of the characters: Cruise was shallow, vain and selfish in both personnas; and the two women who revolved around him were completely uninteresting and predictable.

750,lockersgant,A cinematic master piece both thought provoking and innovative.,10,23 September 2003,"This movie is simply 'great' and shows Tom Cruise to be a much more credible actor than hes given credit for. In addition Cruz and Russell give great performances. The movie itself gives an immaculate look at modern day society and its obsessions, greed and vanity. Moreover Vanilla Sky is captivating and intriguing and will therefore have you and you're friends discussing the film long after the closing credits. The film is a 'must-see' and consequently i am bewildered by the negative press the film has obtained, most notoriously here in the UK. The movie's admittedly a lot darker and complex than your usual Tom Cruise blockbuster, but surely we should applaud this? Having read some of the comments about this film, it only increases my negative stereotype of the general public. God forbid an actor such as Tom Cruise should try something different in his career. Thus my only conclusion is, by putting Cruise on the poster (attracting teenage girls) the film's attracted a certain kind of audience, one with the lack of intelligence to enjoy a clever remarkable film for its own merits.",Vanilla Sky

Cruz is ok, i would like to see her in the original movie so i could compare, and Diaz (with a smaller part) plays the sexy, secretly in love/half-mad friend very well. I liked the ""father-figure"" Russel too. Although at times you can seem lost in the plot, at the end your questions are answered (or maybe not...) and everything makes sense.

It's a MASTERPIECE of a movie. I don't understand the criticism associated with it. It's a rare achievement and has qualities which very few movies possess. It lingers on in your mind even after very long. One year on, and it still stays with me. Though broadly classified as a 'Science Fiction' movie, it has elements of romance and suspense in it. Don't know about the others but I found it a little creepy at times. Especially the 'Power upheaval' part and when Tom Cruise's character performs strange histrionics and hand movements with the psychiatrist. Opening Radiohead's Soundtrack 'Everything in its right place' builds the intrigue right from the onset and REM's 'Sweetness follows' aptly complements the situation when David is forsaken and betrayed by his friends. After all suspense building, the climax doesn't disappoint either. An amazing climax with all the other ingredients, makes 'Vanilla Sky' a treat with great repeat value.",Vanilla Sky

It compelled me to do some googling about it and I'm quite surprised by the mixed reviews it's received by critics and the IMDb community. I don't know how anyone could not love this film. I think the bad reviews must come from those that don't understand the movie (and yes, the plot does get a bit confusing). I won't spoil the story for anyone who hasn't seen it, because it really is that good and has one hell of a twist.This really is an underrated cinematic gem. It's a great psychological thriller with a dash of science fiction, but at its heart it's a touching love story. Whenever I watch this film it churns up so many emotions in me.

I clearly see three different parts of the movie which are in one time interconnected and disconnected. One is happy and carefree life of young, beautiful and successful, other one is nightmare of nightmares, which in comparison with first one becomes even more tough. The third one, the ending - is nothing to be expected and it leaves the viewer in total harmony, while the movie itself is quite disturbing. Acting is brilliant, you can clearly see emotions and live through them through out the movie. The last but not least is that words and phrases in the movie, especially in the ending are so finely sharped that you can use them to live a life worth living.High recommendation, probably for watching alone or in a small quiet company.",Vanilla Sky
761,Lounge_Act,"Confusing, thought-provoking, strangely moving.",10,4 June 2004,"Spoilers within.There's a lot of talk about how Vanilla Sky is inferior when compared to the movie it is based on, called ""Abre Los Ojos."" But I've never seen the original film, so I can objectively say that I enjoyed Vanilla Sky very much, without worrying about how it compares with the original. The first time I watched it, I was thoroughly confused. It was thought-provoking, yes, but a lot of things didn't make sense. Only in subsequent viewings did I really tie everything together and get the most out of what is really an excellent movie.The basic premise of the movie is that the exorbitantly wealthy David Aames (Cruise) is running a company he inherited from his father. He lives his life without thinking of the consequences of his actions: he treats his 'friend' Julie (Diaz) carelessly, and when she finds out that he has really fallen in love with another woman, Sofia (Cruz), things take a grim turn for the worst. At this point, David's life seems to take on many dream-like qualities, and it's difficult for him to decide what is real and what isn't, and who his friends really are.There are a lot of twists and turns in the movie, and in many cases when you think there's a resolution, things just take on another turn. Even if you didn't like the movie, there's no question that after seeing it, you will be thinking about it and speculating for a long time after its over. And in my opinion, that's one of the best things you can say about a movie.What I also liked about the movie was the music that went along with it. There's a lot of good songs that in my opinion, go perfectly with the scenes, and they make for some truly moving moments (the '3-day Memorial' scene still gives me the chills). This is a good time to mention that Jason Lee's performance was just uncanny. I haven't seen him in many serious roles, but he just did a great job. I never thought that a movie like this would be as moving to me as this was, and I still have not seen a lot of movies that were able to evoke the kind of emotions that Vanilla Sky did.Certainly, a lot of people may feel like this was just a big marathon run only to wind up right where you started. But even so, I recommend this movie to anyone, especially someone who enjoys a so called Thinking Man's movie.8.5/10",Vanilla Sky

An intimate affair with his female friend Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) proves to be ultimately his undoing and lead to a turn of surreal, confusing events.He meets the beautiful yet naive Sofia (Penelope Cruz) whom he instantly falls in love with, however Julia becomes jealous of their closeness and seeks revenge against the man she loves, driving her car off a bridge with David and herself in the car, killing her and leaving David severely disfigured.After the crash David becomes a shadow of his former self, becoming paranoid about his appearance, having the most disturbing dreams and falling to understand why he sees the dead Julia everywhere he goes.David eventually succumbs to his paranoia and delusions, ending up in custody charged with a murder he believes he didn't commit, along the way we meet psychologist Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russel) and David's lifelong friend Brian Shelby (Jason Lee), all the while believing that Julia has somehow framed him for her ""murder"" with the help of his enemies.The film ends with onr of the most powerful and compelling scenes I have ever witnessed, David's delusions are explained with a twist to end all other film twists, however David's journey is far from over, he must now make another choice, his true moment of choice.A truly excellent film. 8/10.",Vanilla Sky

I must be honest, I'd seen trailers and thought it looked great but I never would have guessed what the film had in store for me. Like the first flash forward to Tom Cruise in a cell talking about a murder he had supposedly commited, just completely rattled and excited me. Upon watching this film time and time (and time) again on DVD I still believe it to be the best example of how a film should be made. How Cameron Crowe weaved this story from scene to scene, from dream to nightmare to reality is truly remarkable. Tom Cruise at his very best (even though he has been at his best in several other films ie. Magnolia, Jerry Maguire), more so than usual, so open and completely stripped of ego, his performance as David Aames is just magnetic and astonishing to watch. Support (although they all hold the pieces together so perfectly) from Kurt Russell, Jason Lee, Cameron Diaz, Penelope Cruz and Timothy Spall (all already proven to be great actors) just shine. So convincing, so cleverly woven, so intricate i honestly cant say enough, the cast support in this movie warrants recognition, absolutely perfect.

As usual the Hollywood remake has simplified the plot, drained away the cinemotographic beauty and replaced them with shallow overdramatisizations, an oversimplified boringly predictable lineariarized plot and to paraphrase the American director in Jean-Luc Godar's evermemerable ""Pierrot le fou"": «Sex, Violence and Strong emotions». The point is this: watch the original it is a very good movie, keeps you guessing (if you don't know the ending), has good acting and has a nice meaning that is (at leas I think it to be): ""life is more than about the shallow transient things but about who we choose to be"". But if you enjoy the usual Hollywood mixture, then by all means drink the coolaid again.",Vanilla Sky
766,bullardjosh,Superb,10,11 May 2004,"This is perhaps one of the most underrated films of recent years. Open your eyes (the original) has the reputation for being superior in every way. However i do not think this is justified at all, in fact my opinion is the exact opposite. When i saw Vanilla Sky for the first time, i was completely unaware of the story, and the ending left me feeling inspired. However after recently seeing Open Your Eyes, i found that too much of the ending was given away towards the beginning. Even Tom Cruise is excellent in this film. The ending reaches such an amazing epiphany that the film is one of the most emotionally devastating that i have ever seen. i would highly recommend this film to anyone, the beginning may go on a bit but stick with it and you won't be disappointed.(Also worth seeing to see Jason Lee)",Vanilla Sky
767,ryanconi,"great ""thinking"" movie",10,11 May 2004,"The first time that I saw Vanilla Sky I was dragged by my girlfriend and thought it would be a sappy love flick.  To my surprise, this was not true at all. Vanilla Sky is by far my favorite movie of all time and I have seen a very large amount of movies that one might consider great. Vanilla Sky takes the cake in my list. As I read other people's comments I couldn't help but think that maybe people dislike it because they don't understand it. People today want everything hand fed to them in a movie with a big explosion at the end or the bad guy being caught. This is not the movie for that type of movie lover. This is a great movie if you love to think long after the film is over. Only after you have seen it and understand it can you truly enjoy it. If you have never seen it, or if you didn't quite understand it then you should go see it again.",Vanilla Sky

You can either accept the ending or you can't. The movie really makes you think and wonder, ""what's going on?"" You are not always supposed to know what is going on. A lot of people do not want to have to think too much lol. Great movie, good soundtrack. I love rarely when movies change the way you listen to a song. Good Vibrations by the Beach Boys came across in the moment as so eerie, I still think of that now when i hear it. It is a movie that is definitely worth watching.",Vanilla Sky

I've read comments like it was ""long"" and ""boring"". Yes it was long. So? And if you mean it is boring as in there are no guns going off, then yes it would be considered that.

773,macha-3,Spiritual Evolution? Maybe,8,18 April 2005,"There is a very interesting aspect to the movie that may have been left unnoticed which refers to the fact that Tom Cruise's character may actually have died as a result from suicide, and that all the rest of the story refers to him getting adapted to his condition as a spirit, by trying to get the treatment he would be entitled to in the other dimension or parallel universe if you will. In my very particular way of seeing things, I am led to believing that whatever it was that happened to him was the result of the conditions in which he disembodied. By being deformed he may not have accepted death itself, and in this sense, was around, or even better, just wandering around the world of the living for ages until he was informed he was able to climb up to another level of threshold he was sent to, this being understood as the Suicidal Valley. It might as well be understood that his jump was the moment of evolution of his spirit, despite the fact that he may have been evolved to another level even in the body of a cat, where the whole procedure of spiritual evolution would definitely get its start. OPEN YOUR EYES could be understood as ""Ok! One Hundred and Fifty Years have gone by and you have finally learned its time to move on and reincarnate as cat! Chances are you do thing in a better way this time""",Vanilla Sky

Tom Cruise plays a cocky 30 something year old who falls for Penelope Cruise (no relation to Tom......yet). However, at one point Tom Cruise is in a horrible accident and must learn to live with his face all scarred up and disfigured. The twists turn like crazy after this. Jason Lee from DOGMA is superb as Tom's carefree friend. The acting is great, the music is wonderful and the photography is unbelievable. The end was criticized by many but I actually liked it. Yes, this movie does deliver the goods. 7 thumbs up!",Vanilla Sky

I refused to watch any ads, spoilers, previews of it, so I didn't know what to expect. It is the sort of film that has many layers, all working and intertwining with each other. Is it sci-fi? Is it a 'reality' film? Who really knows. It will have to be watched more than once because you have to get past Tom. Tom is Tom in so many of his films, that it can be difficult to get into his character. So, the first viewing will take in just so much, and will definitely provoke questions in your mind. Your curiosity aroused, you will have to watch it again, and perhaps again to begin to answer these questions. you may never get to the bottom of the film, but this is why the film is so satisfying - because it never really satisfies. It is an ingenious film that will keep you wondering for a long time to come.",Vanilla Sky
776,Kate-me,Wonderful,10,9 November 2005,This is so sad and so hard to watch. It shows us what a HUGE role vanity plays in our life. God some of the scenes are so hard to watch. They feel so real. You can Feel David's pain. Its perfect. I think the scenes when he is alone in his apartment are the best. You can just see the paon and humility and Rejection he feels. He cant even function in society. The people are just SO rude to him because of his looks? Its pathetic how much weight we put on the way someone looks. It leaves me always feeling as if I've just had a catharsis. Life is so fragile and short and it just makes you question what really matters. I think the imagery Crowe uses is amazing. The scenes in the park at fall? The music fits every scene perfectly. Just a great film with such natural acting. It flows well and it will make you think.,Vanilla Sky

I especially like after the third time I watched it since I understood it completely. When you understand all the events in this movie you maybe have a chance of liking it more. The music was great in fact I bought the soundtrack it's really good. The actors are also good in the movie but the thing that impressed me the most has to be the images and the visual aspect.

This is the kind of movie that people either tend to love or hate. The difference lies in how much you paid attention during the film. If you're prone to miss details when they're presented in a movie, then yeah, I can see why Vanilla Sky would throw you. However, in my view, all of the confusing details are wrapped up quite nicely so that the few questions one might have are answered very well.

Romance, lust, horror, tragedy, comedy. It's all there and realised superbly.The acting is excellent, the story is intelligent and the direction is tight, but for me the high point was the perfect selection of music for each scene (maybe just because I like Radiohead and REM) which pushes home the true emotion and beauty (sometimes tragic) in this grossly underrated masterpiece.If you haven't seen it do.

You cannot tell what is real from what is not. It skips back and fourth through time. Good thing that this film isn't well known because if it was the suicide rate on earth would rise by 30%. I wish that I had never bought it, they wouldn't give me my money back so I ran it over with my car multiple times. The only thing that kept my through it was penelope cruz (and she isn't even that good looking). I am glad that tom cruise' face gets mangled because he deserves it for making such a bad film. At one point I considered throwing it away but I think that my bin is too good for that. I also considered giving it away but I didn't want other people too feel the pain I suffer every single day after watching It. So my only choice was to destroy it so that no one could pick it up by accident again. I think that on the ring they shouldn't have used that freaky film, they should have used this one.

786,uus-1,Vanilla Sky,10,23 February 2006,"Vanilla Sky is the most interesting movie I have ever watched. The movie is an amazing look at the human condition and how maybe our priorities should be straightened out. It is also much a more emotional and spiritual than the its predecessor Abre Los Ojos(1997). It seems that the things that we dream may be the things that come true. ""Follow your dreams"", ""Set Goals"" as the oldies say. It is amazing as it has so many layered meanings. It is well done in the minor details and did not give away much as to his death and what he actually was. The street scene where he runs down it with it empty is absolutely amazing and breathtaking cinema. The opening scene is also amazing as of the soundtrack.The soundtrack including Radiohead's ""Everything Is In It's Right Place"", Jeff Buckley's ""Last Goodbye"" and ""Vanilla Sky"" by Paul McCartney. The soundtrack adds to the themes of the movie and also to the atmosphere.Cameron Crowe also though it did not fool me was a great twist as it took me a whole year of constant explanation to my uncle.Whereas I got what was going on about 45-60 minutes in.Tom Cruise does the most breathtaking performance of his career as David Aames. The sexy scenes are amazing as we get to see the delectable female form of Penelope Cruz, those who saw Head In The Clouds may want to reference back to this film if they have a fancy for the Cruzer.The most amazing reference in the film is to Citzen Kane which really works in this movie and ""Citzen Dildo"" is also brought in to this to highlight it to people who may not know Citzen Kane. This was extremely funny, and Penelope's line ""You are not sleeping over"" is an absolute hoot.To watch Vanilla Sky I recommend viewing Abre Los Ojos (1997)(The film Vanilla Sky is based on) and Citzen Kane (1941)(References are made in the film to his movie and education from this will be useful to understand these references.)",Vanilla Sky

The differences between ""Vanilla sky"" and ""abre los ojos"" are pure cosmetic: the underlying story is exactly the same. And the atmospheric soundtrack of the original film is infinitely better than the impersonal list of pop hits that can be heard in the Crowe's film.This film is a waste of resources. A movie can be based on another one, as long as introduces new elements that expands the previous film. This is not the case. This version follows the original in each sequence. The producer should invest time in new ideas, and not steal european films to remake them.",Vanilla Sky
788,Tony-75,"Complexity, brilliance, and the confusing 'splice'.",10,18 January 2002,"Note: These comments are for people who have seen the movie.Vanilla Sky is a brilliant, complex, and thrilling movie that existentially explores exactly what the tag-line says: LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends. Maybe the movie plot can come into focus for confused movie-goers if one looks at it from a different angle.Considering the following:Now, I have not painstakingly gone through the film scene by scene, so I will have to further examine my assertions, (and I welcome your thoughts) but give this a try and see if the movie doesn't fall into place: Where exactly does the debatable 'splice' occur?Now, I'm not talking about the splice as it is explained by the L.E. 'technician', since that sequence itself could be actually interpreted as a rationalization inside of David Aames's mind/dream/coma state, but the true splice between reality and dream.It seems to me that the reality of the car crash, the way that it is filmed (no explosion, for example) is a likely 'splice' point, and that any particular sequence containing an existential/dream/coma/non-reality feel to it -- whether it's shown onscreen before or after the crash -- is actually a part of Aames' personal journey toward self-realization inside of his own mind.In that respect, then, we are left with two questions at the very end(if you know of more, let me know): is Aames actually disfigured, and where does he wake up?If you don't get entirely wrapped up in the exact sequence of details in the plot, or at what particular point his dreams are scattered throughout, this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a human on a journey to find himself and what that means in today's pop-culture society.",Vanilla Sky
789,tonypro,Definitely a different movie.....,8,17 December 2001,"I really could not wait to see this film. Tom is always great, (sans Eyes Wide Open), the rest of the cast is great also. I loved the movie Jerry M. (Plain and simply I love movies.) Vanilla Sky has no comparison to plain vanilla anything. It was exhausting both emotionally and mentally. I feel it has entertainment substance, but not at the same level as a typical Hollywood cookie cutter movie. After the movie was over I must admit I was disappointed and speechless. In fact I spoke nothing to my wife until we were out of the theater, and then my first words were `people who take acid should not make movies' , `there should be a law against it somewhere!'. Does anyone remember Funny Farm with Chevy Chase and Madolyn Smith-Osborne? In the movie she reviews his horrible script. She said she couldn't keep up with what was going on because of too many flashbacks, several flash forwards and even a couple of flash sideways. Well she could have easily been reviewing this movie!! However, for the past 3 days I have mulled the story over and over in my head many times, and believe it or not I feel compelled to recommend this movie. The premise/plot of the movie is awesome. I just wish it would have been done a little different to afford the viewer a clearer understanding. If you go be prepared, and you may enjoy it if not wait a few days you still might.",Vanilla Sky
790,tromeo,"Great humor, excellent cast... and more than a bit disturbing.",9,12 December 2001,"This is a very trippy movie, and the less you know about the plot going into the theater, the stronger it's effect will be.  It's one of those Sixth Sense/ Usual Suspects/ Devil's Advocate ""what-the-heck-is-going-on"" types. The difference is, Vanilla Sky doesn't just throw out clues as to what's going on... it throws out red herrings, too.  And then --just to keep you questioning what you see even more-- tells the majority of the story in flashbacks & dream sequences.Don't be surprised if Cameron Diaz ends up getting an Oscar nomination for her role as ""the saddest girl ever to hold a martini.""  Aside from Being John Malkovich, this is her best role yet.Tom Cruise's performance reminded me strongly of his role in Jerry Maguire (another Cameron Crowe movie).  His character is not used to caring for anyone but himself, and once again his self-centered lifestyle ends up inflicting serious emotional damage to those who love him.  Instead of yelling ""show me the money"", this time he's yelling something else... but telling what it is would ruin the surprise. ;0)Lots of comedy and witty dialogue throughout the movie, much more than you would expect from seeing the trailers.  Jason Lee seemed to get the bulk of the funny bits, but Cruise gets in his share of memorable zingers, too.I gave it a 9, because I haven't seen a movie this good for several months, but it wasn't quite perfect.  The plot seemed to drag on unnecessarily just a little near the end (teasing the audience before the conclusion, perhaps?), and that kept me from gracing it with a 10.",Vanilla Sky

792,MsTralwind,Crowe takes us on an awesome and chilling ride,10,16 December 2001,"I loved Vanilla Sky. I loved the idea of Vanilla Sky. But it's a hard movie to sit through.Cameron throws you right into the film...with no warning that it's even the film that's about to start. (See the film and you will know exactly what I mean.)The intention of this movie was to mess with your mind...I just know it.VS ain't for everyone. It's something along the lines of ""Sixth Sense"". There are clues as to what's real and what's not, and unfortunately Cameron doesn't pull it off as well as M. Night did in ""Sixth Sense. For me though it worked well enough.For anyone who has ever wished they could live someone elses life, this movie is for you. It's subtle in it's message but the movie addresses that very thing. How would you change your life...rewrite your life...if you could.The music was awesome. And the Times Square scene everyone's been talking about... I found it quite chilling and disturbing. Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances ever.There is good chemistry between Tom and Penelope. I adored her in this movie. She's funny and charming and counter's the flaws we see in David instantly.The acting was great...the cast was well chosen for this movie...but like any Cameron Crowe movie, the main reason I went to see this film was because it is a Cameron Crowe film. I worried that it might not have turned out like a Cameron Crowe film because it was based on someone else's movie. But this movie has all the required elements of a good Crowe flick. It's got humor and the love story is sweet and the idea that it's the little things...the in-between-times that people cherish...plays well in this movie. It ultimately comes off as if Cameron dreamed up this whole ride all by himself.The only thing NON-Cameron about the movie was it's dark feel. But isn't that kind of like the whole sweet and sour thing. How can you ever really appreciate the light if you don't experience a little darkness?See this movie twice before judging it. Some movies were not meant to be seen in one sitting and digested quickly. This one leaves you thinking (about the consequences of the choices we make in life and love and is casual sex really casual...and how pop culture really does affect our day to day lives) and it leaves you guessing.Again, this movie isn't for everyone. You have to be willing to get on the ride to enjoy the ride. And to enjoy the ride, you have to like that kind of ride. It's kind of like getting on the roller coaster when you are really more of a tilt-o-whirl kind of person. If you don't like this kind of ride, the ride might just make you puke...so to speak.",Vanilla Sky
793,gknell,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it: See the original, skip this",1,24 March 2002,"Vanilla Sky was a huge disappointment.  Based upon the Spanish film, Open Your Eyes (which was brilliant), Cameron Crowe ruins the movie with hard-pounding music, over-simplification of the plot by taking out any semblance of nuance or thinking on the part of the audience, and idiotic re-writes.  I thought Vanilla Sky was panned because the audiences didn't understand its premise.  Hardly.  Crowe leaves nothing open to interpretation; rather, he spells everything out in black and white and Hollywoodizes the ending.  Everything I loved about Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes), Crowe ruined.  I believed nothing.  Tom Cruise gives one of the worst performances in a decade.  Like Cruise's lack of chemistry with Rene Zellwinger in Jerry Maguire, Cruise has no chemistry with Penelope Cruz, who reprises her role from the Spanish original, in expanded and unnecessary fashion.  Vanilla Sky is a waste of time and money.  I found nothing redeeming about it, other than when it finally ended and the pain of such a bad experience was over.",Vanilla Sky
794,justingodley,Crowe's Pop World,10,16 December 2001,"Cameron Crowe has proven himself once again in Vanilla Sky, his follow-up to last year's Almost Famous.  With wonderful pop culture references, pop music, and not to mention Mr. Tom Cruise, Crowe has left us with a very original take on the original film, Abre los Ojos.  Radiohead, Jeff Buckley, Bob Dylan, and the Beach Boys are just some of the tunes that fill Vanilla's sky.  There is one scene that relly left an impression on me that uses the Beach Boy's song, Good Vibrations.  I don't want to give anything away, but I will say that the contrast it had with the scene had me giddy.  This film got me excited about film again, and reminded me that there are real directors left in the world.  You can tell Crowe is doing what he loves, and that he is a fan of movies as well.  I remember reading a story about when he and Cruise were going over to Billy Wilder's home, trying to convince him to do a cameo in Jerry Maguire.  Wilder was Crowe's mentor, and in Cameron's hand as he walked into Wilder's hous, was an original poster from Wilder's film, The Apartment, Crowe's favorite film.

800,dormlights,An incredible film wide open for criticism.,10,15 December 2001,"All right, I'll get this right out of the way.  I'm a Cameron Crowe fan, and consider myself lucky to claim as such.  Also, I have never seen Abre Los Ojos.  Those who feel this negates my right to defend this film need not read further.  All I can tell those of you who may have seen this once and thought it was too out there is to give it another chance to prove itself. Trust me, my loyalty to Crowe aside, I was worried when I walked in to see this one.  It was a total departure for the guy who made Say Anything..., Singles, Jerry Maguire, and Almost Famous (Untitled).  Also, it was the first time he'd ever directed anything that wasn't wholly original.  I was skeptical that so many critics could be wrong about this film, but the more I watched and got absorbed in the story, the more it worked.  I gave this movie three stars out of four upon leaving the first time.  After seeing it again for the second time tonight, I leave it at a solid three and a half. And the only reason I don't give it four is because it is not an original idea.  Aside from that, it's a four star film.  But here's the reason I'm writing.  I didn't love this movie for the twist (and enough with saying HOW MANY twists there are because there's only really one if you're paying any kind of attention).  The twists like this have been done before in different ways in The Matrix and Total Recall (to say nothing of its predecessor. So, in my opinion, to call this a brilliant film based on its narrative alone would at best be doing a disservice to its inspiration and at worst be an uninformed statement of someone fresh from seeing a new and interesting film.  What I really loved about this movie was how true love was captured. And not, as Cruise AND Cruz have maintained, in the love scenes but in those little moments of perfection that Crowe delivers in spades.  This is why I have loved Crowe since his first film and have stuck with him all of these years.  Who could have possibly torn apart the world and stopped Lloyd from playing In Your Eyes in Say Anything?  Or broken that perfect silence after Cliff says ""bless you"" at the end of Singles?  Or prevented that tear from forming (even if it didn't drop) when Jerry Maguire says ""you complete me"" and you realize he's carried it with him all that time?  Or not feel a shudder run through them when Penny is sitting in the plane at the end of Almost Famous and has that look of realization?  Or taken their eyes off of David's face when he looked back at Sofia that one last time in Vanilla Sky? This is why I love this movie.  Crowe has put enough love at the core of this movie to make my soul ache from it.  And those who will put away their checklists of what makes a good movie good (a very subjective idea, I might add) and take this film in as the fluidity of feeling that I personally believe it was committed to the screen in the first place to convey will find something that transcends the confines of celluloid.",Vanilla Sky

802,thaggas12,Getting one up on the critics,10,2 January 2002,"Well, judging by the opinions of the voters, it seems a lot of IMDb users liked the movie. So that leaves the question, where did the critics get off giving the film D's and F's?After a year of Freddy getting Fingered, and Pearl Harbor getting blown up in majestic CGI reality, Cameron Crowe offers us a serious intellectual film. But it appears that all of those dopey, crappy movies have destroyed the brain cells of almost every critic. They called the film ""self-indulgent."" Well, if Vanilla Sky is self-indulgent and ""Pearl Harbor"" isn't, then we need a new dictionary. They called it ""confusing."" Just because a film causes you think for about ten minutes after seeing it, it's confusing?The film is generating discussion and that's what it's supposed to do. In this post-Survivor world, we need some serious antidote to get that quasi-reality our of our systems. What's big deal if it involves delving into David Aames sub-conscious? This is the most realistic film of the year, and also the most fantastical.

803,nbawriter1,Am I dreaming?,9,20 December 2001,"This film left me amazed. I really don't want to give an ounce of the movie away because the less you know going in the more you'll get from it. The performances were strong and Cameron Crowe pulled the strings wonderfully. There were times this movie was a still as a Minnesota lake and others when it was as rough as the Hawaiian surf, and the directing was seamless.I have to say I am shocked that so many IMDb uses are complaining about ""Vanilla Sky"" being frustrating and overly complicated and leaving audiences unfulfilled. While ""Vanilla Sky"" is certainly full of twists and turns and makes you think a great deal, it's about 100 times less taxing than ""Memento,"" which I consider one of the best movies of the last 10 years.I have yet to see original, foreign version of this movie, but I certainly look forward to doing so. Again, there are those who are bitching and moaning about this version paling in comparison to the original. It seems to me that the screenplay is strong enough that both versions can have their own merits.I gave it 9 out of 10 ... a borderline Oscar nomination. Wouldn't be surprised to see it get one, wouldn't be shocked if it didn't. But if you like movies that stick in your head beyond the time you're in the theater (unlike Ocean's 11, which was enjoyable, but out of the mind by the time I turned the ignition going home) you'll get your money's worth. Trust me.",Vanilla Sky
804,Codeybear911,One of my Favorite Movies and Soundtracks!,9,19 April 2006,"This movie consists of such great emotion especially with its outstanding soundtrack that coincides with the film. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm to make films and to entertain. This movie was not the best the first time I watched it, but after about 3 more times I decided that this is one of the best films that I have ever seen. It takes place in New York, and progresses on through his lifestyle. He discovers a delimma in his life with his girlfriend (Diaz). He goes through a state of depression and then an outgoing blend of imagination. This film was beyond my expectations, and is one of Cruise's best films ever!",Vanilla Sky

Vanilla Sky is an intensely stimulating film, however, it almost got too much for me half way through. But with a little perseverance and patience, even if you do feel overwhelmed and slightly lost, the rewards are well worth the work. The films great cast and script make it well worth watching and in my opinion this is probably Tom Cruise's best performance to date.

The best friend, the father figure, the seven dwarfs and LE all make me watch in awe. I have never been able to watch the final scene on the rooftop without shedding a little tear and I'm a fully grown emotionally in control type of guy.

807,j-lyus,The Worst Film ever made,1,31 May 2006,"This has got to be one of the worst films ever made. The story line is so bad that I know children that could have done better. The story line appeared to lack any direction or content. The star character is unbelievable and throughout the film I was amazed by the things occurring. After I finished watching this film my first thought was that there is 2 hours of my life I will never get back.The cinematography and make-up were very good, though, and about the only positive in an otherwise pointless film.I have my reservations as Tom Cruise as an actor. Whilst Tom has been in some very good films I feel that the films would have been a lot better if someone else was starring. Tom has got to be one of the luckiest actors around because some of the parts he has been given could fool anybody into believing he could actual act. You can always measure an actors ability in a film when the are co-staring with undoubtedly good actors. For example 'Interview with a vampire' showed me that whilst Brad Pitt could act Tom Cruise couldn't. This film would have been better if they had employed a better actor which could have raised the standard of the film, but the story still would have been terrible and unbelievable.My suggestion is get another film.",Vanilla Sky

811,Paul Brennan,an excellent film,10,11 January 2003,"After reading multiple comments about how rotten Vanilla Sky was, I felt like I had to offer an alternative opinion to the list. I couldn't help but enjoy this film for its visual style as well as its abnormal storyline taken from ""Open Your Eyes."" I agree with many that Cameron Diaz gave a fantastic performance.. and I have yet to see Jason Lee in a role that he did not steal the show with, however, I have to go out on a limb and say that Tom Cruise, also, excelled in Vanilla Sky. In fact, I find that Tom Cruise generally give good performances, but his ""pretty boy"" image makes certain that he is never taken seriously. I'm not saying he is any Brando or Oliver, but I think that his talents would be taken more seriously if he was of average or less average looks. What I love most about Vanilla Sky is that I can watch it time and time again, and catch a new element of the story every time. If you haven't seen it, try it.

Cameron Crowe writes the story for you and Tom Cruise is only there to make you wish you looked like him when you're going through what he's going through.

I went to see Vanilla Sky having been told that it was a very weird movie and that I probably wouldn't like it if I was expecting anything similar to Crowe's other films.  Well, having just seen it, let me say that the former was correct, and the latter couldn't have been more wrong.  It is a very weird movie, and nothing really comes together until the end.  Anyone who tells you that they saw it coming halfway into the movie is either lying to you or is unable to detach their hindsight from their memory.  Anyway, the movie was stellar, and I look forward to owning it as soon as the DVD is released.  I was moved by the film, and felt emotionally spent by the end.  This is an experience that will draw from the viewer the entire spectrum of human emotion, if the viewer allows him/herself into the plot.  In the theatre in which I saw the movie, there were more than a few people who clearly lost track of the movie and were bored by it when they found that they were unable to get back into the plot.  I'm sure others just lack the ability to properly follow any movie like this.  I don't mean that to sound pompous, but some people are more cut out for the Seagal, Chan, Van Damme genre of movies, and these are the types that probably would not enjoy this movie.  It is very cerebral, so make sure you are prepared for a two hour mental bender, as well as much thought afterwards.As far as comparing this film to other Crowe movies, it is very similar in at least one regard, in all Crowe movies, the soundtrack is a character unto itself.  This is almost definitely due to Crowe's longstanding ties to music, as anyone who has seen Almost Famous knows, and to his marriage to Heart star Nancy Wilson.  It was also worthy to note that there was a definite chemistry between Tom Cruise's acting and Crowe's directing that made the movie seem familiar to anyone who has seen Jerry Maguire.  In my mind, that is not a bad thing.Anyway, if I had to compare this movie to any one other film, I would say this:  if you enjoyed David Fincher's The Game, you will almost certainly be a fan of Vanilla Sky.",Vanilla Sky

It's kind of  boring in a few stretches, and I couldn't help checking my watch several times or getting a little antsy at points.  I don't think the film's message is as great and mindblowing as others perceive it to be (in fact I was really disappointed with the ""quick wrap-up"" at the end and found it sort of lame) and I don't think it could ever compare with Memento or whatever awesome films some other viewers have likened it to.And yes, it has a great soundtrack, but it's too loud and awkwardly interjected into the movie...",Vanilla Sky

Unfortunately, in the city I live in, there isn't much of a chance for exposure to art of that nature. So, if I want to see art like that in the theater, I have to settle for Vanilla Sky. Any film that includes the lines ""This is a revolution of the mind"" and ""Oh I'm sorry, I'm blowing your mind"" isn't really doing anything to your mind.It's easy to throw out the ideas that are thrown in this movie if you pad them with 15 minutes of explanation and ""lubby-dubby"" dialogue.I have a hard time understanding how anyone could not understand this movie seeing that they spend forever explaining the concept that wasn't that incomprehensible in the first place.On Jay Leno, Cameron Crowe said that this is a ""love story"" and that is what is wrong with this movie. In someone else's hands, this film could have been great, but it also could have been much worse. Cameron should stick to movies like ""jerry maguire"" and ""almost famous"" and ""say anything"" he is good at those.If you mixed up the most outrageous art house film you ever sawand the sappiest, stupidest love story you ever saw, you would get Vanilla Sky. We only need so many lines that ""sum up the human condition in one phrase"" before they sound tired.
I definitely liked this movie enough to recommend it, though.         It proposes ideas and questions that wouldn't be proposed to the general audience if it didn't have so many stars in it. and the final minute is well done for impact. generally every song fit (except for ""good vibrations"")There were a few really good scenes now that I think of it.But, of course, how could you pass up any movie that includes the funniest thing you can ever include in a movie ...........................................................

820,mindcraft-1,Vanilla Sky is dream come true.,10,19 August 2006,"I could not agree more with the quote ""this is one of the best films ever made."" If you think Vanilla Sky is simply a ""re-make,"" you could not be more wrong. There is tremendous depth in this film: visually, musically, and emotionally.Visually, because the film is soft and delicate at times (early scenes with Sofia) and at other times powerful and intense (Times Square, post-climactic scenes).The music and sounds tie into this movie so perfectly. Without the music, the story is only half told. Nancy Wilson created an emotional, yet eclectic, score for the film which could not be more suitable for such a dream-like theme (although never released, I was able to get my hands on the original score for about $60. If you look hard, you may be able to find a copy yourself). Crowe's other musical selections, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, the Monkees, etcetera etcetera, are also perfect fits for the film (Crowe has an ear for great music).More importantly, the emotional themes in this film (i.e. love, sadness, regret) are very powerful, and are amplified tenfold by the visual and musical experience, as well as the ingenious dialogue; I admit, the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes time and time again.The best part of this film however (as if it could get any better) is that it is so intelligently crafted such that each time you see the film, you will catch something new--so watch closely, and be prepared to think! Sure, a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch, but there is always more to the story than you think.This is easily Cameron Crowe's best work, and altogether a work of brilliance. Much of my film-making and musical inspiration comes from this work alone. It has honestly touched my life, as true art has a tendency of doing. It continually surprises me that there are many people that cannot appreciate this film for what it is (I guess to understand true art is an art itself).Bottom line: Vanilla Sky is in a league of its own.",Vanilla Sky

831,rankinrip,Cruise fumbles the lead...,6,14 February 2002,"Cameron Crowe is a great director and as always he managed to maximize the sensory experience through visuals and an amazing soundtrack.  But writer/director Alejandro Amenábar (""The Others"") is no slouch himself and Crowe demonstrates his respect by taking the original script almost for gospel and by using many of the same shots such as the ones in the disco club and on top of the roof in the finale.  In my opinion, the remake falls substantially short of the original, because of the limited development of the central character.  The original was played by a very talented Spanish actor, Eduardo Noriega (""The Devil's Backbone""), who did a great job paralleling his internal change with the external one.  The key underpinning of the entire movie is that the audiece believe that this rich, cocky womanizer falls fast and hard for Cruz and realizes in one night that he will never be the same.  But just as quickly everything is taken from him in a cruel twist of fate and when he finally appears to have regained his lost love, the audience's heart is ripped right out of their chests when they realize that all is an illusion.  But Cruise just forced it so damn badly that you never believed he really fell for this girl that night.  He flashes her a smile, so he's in love?  He flashed the same damn smile at Diaz though.  So why does he love Cruz over Diaz?  Diaz is just as attractive and she speaks English a hell of a lot better.  There was no transition or juxtaposition that made the audience think ""Wow, this little Spanish girl really knocked his socks off.""  As a result, he makes Penelope Cruz look like a poser.  Not her fault at all though.  Similarly, Jason Lee was supposed to be his weaker, ordinary looking, little brother buddy, but Cruise comes across as weaker of the two friends in their scenes together. Noriega just made much better choices.  From the opening scene, he makes it clear that he generally disdains women.  They are a trophy, similar to his money and his cars.  Cruise just plays the opening scene with the same ""$hit-eating grin"" waving to every secretary in the office as he wanders the halls of the company that he owns like a drunken party boy and a moron. He plays his character like Adam Sandler played ""Billy Madison"".  Despite being the lead of the movie, he seems to take no control over his conflicts.",Vanilla Sky

It touches you at a very deep level if you let it. The movie can be interpreted in a lot of ways but however you look at it, there are many parables that can be drawn. The movie is about consequences, free-will, the ephemeral nature of true love and the problem with wanting too much of a good thing, a dream-like world if you will. When we only dream and not live in the real world which is filled with both pleasure and pain, our make-belief world eventually rears its ugly head and gives us a reality check, which is exactly what David goes through in his warped lucid dream.Every action, however small, has consequences - if we take a step back and review our own life's timeline, we will probably realize that all the significant events started from something very little (""The Little Things. There Is Nothing Bigger, Isn't It?""). My favorite quote from the movie is ""The Sweet Is Never As Sweet Without The Sour"". I interpret this to mean that we can only have a true sense of life if there are ups and downs. We only learn to do better after making mistakes and experiencing some pain. The last lesson I got from the movie is that perfection does not exist and is a seductive illusory entity that sucks us in and depresses us. We should learn to unveil the masks we hide behind everyday and accept ourselves and our reality for there is beauty and hope even in our so-called ugly, problem laden lives.A must-watch!",Vanilla Sky
835,jctbm,falls short of original,6,4 January 2007,"I'm going to put my feelings about the actors and actresses past aside. I am going to only critique them for this movie. For anyone who hasn't seen Abre Los Ojos (the original version) in its original language cannot understand how much this movie is lacking. Tom Cruise (whom is generally a pretty d*mn good actor) does a horrible job in this one. However, i think the only way to really see how bad he does is by comparing him to the actor from Abre Los Ojos. He had a much more realistic feel. I also like the setting form abre los ojos. The fact that penelope cruz was a mine in the other one instead of a dancer also helps a lot. It just makes more sense for a younger character to play this role. Tom Cruise was wayyy too old for this role and it really shows on the big screen. Besides the OKAY acting (bad acting by the best friend), the old actors, the setting, and the crappy remake. The worst part of the movie has to be how the Simpsons and conan obrien are present in the movie. It really takes away from the beauty of a movie. This is one of the biggest reason people tend to like foreign and indie films. It's a chance to get away from that crap that many cannot escape from their normal lives.",Vanilla Sky

839,beulahtengo,I didn't *completely* hate it.,3,19 December 2001,"First of all let me say I'm a huge fan of Cameron Crowe (the film's screenwriter/director).  I loved Say Anything, Singles, Almost Famous, and even Jerry Maguire and Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  However, Vanilla Sky is so completely different from all of Crowe''s other movies that by the end it was just plain vanilla. My main complaints?  1) the script.  Bad dialogue, for one.  The script although not particularly stellar in the first half of the movie, waxed cheesy, sci-fi, and flat l towards the end, and elements of ""A.I."" and ""Memento"" (the latter of which I loved) took over in what many people, including me, were anticipating to be a much more traditional love story.  2) NO character development.  I particularly don't like new characters being introduced near the film's end, especially ones who offer a weak explanation of the movie's deep, profound, spiritual meaning.  Blech.  3) Length.  I frequently find exceptions to my personal rule that if a movie takes more than 2 hours to tell its story then it's way too long, but I was ready for this to be over about an hour before it ended. I did love certain scenes, including the beginning and ending sequences, the soundtrack was incredible, and certain shots make me want to go back and more closely examine the film.  for some movies, I would do this.  But I don't care about the characters at all, and found the movie to be grasping at straws seeking profundity, so at this point i don't care to waste my time and money again.",Vanilla Sky
840,shanionelligano,THIS IS A GREAT FILM PEOPLE - WE'RE ALL THE PROOF!,9,31 January 2002,"Ok people I've read many of the theories proposed about this film on the message board. I've seen people heralding the genius of this film and I've seen people professing the pretension of this film.People are unhappy with it, for conflicting reasons. Some people have said that the entire film is too complicated and vague, while others have said that the ending is a sell-out, put on a plate for the viewer and thus compromising its artistic integrity.I would certainly disagree with the latter opinion. I think that the end of the film is unpredictable, original, and damn entertaining. It sheds light on ALL the seemingly inexplicable inconsistancies, which really boil down to the continuous alteration of the reality Dave perceives. It gives the entire course of events a surreal plausibility(if that makes any sense!).
And yet, it leaves an element of mystery. The 'open your eyes' line at the end opens up an entirely new can of worms. The 'is he just after opening his eyes to a new dream?' question is provoked. And that is I believe an invitation for the viewer to examine what exactly is so damn irrefutably real about OUR own reality? The cryogenics 'lucid dream' explanation when it comes provides a much more satisfying twist than simply explaining Dave's delusions with psychosis.It is a little far-fetched perhaps, the idea that this type of technology would be accessible, but a little application of imagination and it shouldn't bother even the most ardent of cynics. They are the very people complaining that the viewer is spoonfed by the final ten minutes synopsis of what occured. So can't they use that brain of theirs they so love to use and decide for themselves how this could have been possible?I had heard absolutely no feedback or read any reviews before I went to see this film, and as such, didn't expect much based on the current standard of American movies. It blew me away. The best film I've seen in ages. I've also gathered that by the sheer volume of comments on this message board it provoked a lot of thought in others, displayed either willingly or in the mask of cynicism which (along with attempting to assert yourself to others and compensate for your deficits in other areas) was an indication of the thought-provoking majesty of this great film.",Vanilla Sky
841,BubbleChog,This film truly annoyed me!,3,9 June 2002,I was lucky enough to see Abre los Ojos. Which in every way is superior to this version of the story. That film felt like a discovery.

842,premiere-1,Watch Abre Los Ojos instead!!!,2,28 January 2002,"I can find no justification for this remake other than as a trade off for Amenavar to get Cruise to produce The Others. And the story for the Others and Amenavar's track record is so good that I'm sure this wasn't necessary for his jump to ""studio"" flicks. Abre Los Ojos is not some old black and white movie or low production value gerrilla film which could really be rediscovered by the gloss ""contemporary"" hollywood treatment. Abre Los Ojos is fine as it is, more elegant, shocking, and intensely directed than Vanilla Sky and it's not even 5 years old. Come on. I'm sure Crowe might've enjoyed the break from both writing and directing, but his upbeat talents, gracefully evident in  Almost Famous are totally out of place in this work-for-hire remake of what is a dark, current, exhilarating film: Abre los ojos.",Vanilla Sky
843,nirit,Amenábar shouldn`t have sold his idea,7,28 January 2002,"Frankly speaking, I went to see this movie only for the reason I was curious about what Tom Cruise had made from this fantastic, terrific Spanish movie, but I was really disappointed. The only positive thing what I can say about the remake is that an empty Times Square at 9 o`clock in the morning is for sure far more impressive than Paseo de la Castellana in Madrid, and I liked the opening scene of Manhattan`s view from above. The rest is just a weak attempt to settle the story in the American reality. All the characters are much better in the original film, including Penélope Cruz: even if she has a lovely Spanish accent in English, the fact is in Amenábar`s movie she acted better. I also heard from people that hadn`t had the chance to see ""Open your eyes"" that it was very difficult for them to understand the plot. And finally, although Cruise spent, as I believe, bigger bucks on his film than Amenábar, adding all kinds of special effects, money is not everything: it`s talent what really matters.",Vanilla Sky
844,fellowship_11,Moral interrogation on a disk.,10,3 August 2007,"I got my copy of vanilla sky in China were it was sold for a rather pricey 40 English pence. Not sure of the quality of either the physical product or the movie I did not set myself up in the usual relaxed and open fashion to take on the film. Open your eyes, the film Vanilla Sky was based of can compare with VS as a more reserved and classical type of a film with some grandeur thrown in to arouse the senses. But I don't want to compare as to what is better for doing that would immediately take the films out of context, especially when I think VS deserves undivided attention and several playthroughs. Now I'll tell you why.VS starts by taking on a more structured and visceral tone. Sound acting and the elevated emotions within characters go far to tell the story effectively. The use of NY City displayed in a modern showcase I think gives the watcher a better understanding of what is going in and the approaches used. I don't want to spoil much but I will just a little. A good looking wealthy man (Cruise) who lives a young and somewhat careless life is someone's car when they decide to drive of a bridge and kill themselves in the process. Cruise survives but his face ends up scarred and disfigured.The story is of how his life is changed is what VS is about, or is it how change was halted? That's one question to ask as you play through. With the crash he looses things that he had taken for granted before and we are asked the question of what substance fills the emotions of life and the connection between them. ""You have to have some sour to appreciate the sweet"". Lines like this describe the honeycombed life that he led and how his social aspirations were what he lived off, something he can now not achieve like he used to.There are more things to consider too. One is realisation not just of your own emotions, but those of others. The difference between reality and lucidity. The creations within our own mind. Some may watch the film and think some of the characters are shallow and formulaic, but in these cases that is precisely what they are meant to be.In terms of emotion VS strikes many cords. There is an odd psychedelic tone mixed with Romance, discovery and wondering and sometimes shock, horror. There are shots in the film that make your heart take a leap and it takes you off your guard enough so that if you study your emotions afterwards you will see what you would be like in Cruise's place.Technically speaking, the direction is sound and the music gives an artistic quality mixed with new tones that represent the science fiction based twist the movie possesses. Some shots are the most profound you will see in many films to come. VS is a film that is impossible to categorize and has a story that could lead several ways depending on your perception and choice to accept facts against fiction. There is a huge amount to look out for in the details that help discover the story more effectively or push the possibility towards you that the entire film is softly leading you astray. It's hard to know for sure. So watch it a few times, and each time you do, choose a different path, and different side, and see what new things you find.",Vanilla Sky

""She looks like a moth""???  ""Holy God""???

If I didn't know that they were a couple then I would have figured it out in that scene.  A movie like this really makes you think about your life, I haven't seen a lot of movies that can do that.

It seemed as though it would be a real thriller.  My feeling is that ""they don't make movies like they used to"".  For example, my idea of a great thriller is ""What Lies Beneath"".We both felt that Vanilla Sky was not at all a thriller, as it had been promoted to be.  By watching the promos, we had assumed that it would be something along the lines of ""Diaz fakes her death and 'messes; with Cruise's mind 'from the supposed grave .  Possibly he would be sought after for her murder and he would all the while try to prove to everyone that she was not dead but had actually faked her death to get revenge.""Never has a trailer/promo misrepresented a movie so poorly!!!  While driving home from the theater discussing how terrible this movie was, these are some of the words we used; ""freaky"", ""dark"", ""slow"", ""boring"", and ""so confusing to follow that it was not at all entertaining"".We are sending an e-mail to our friends in hopes that they will not waste their hard earned dollars on this movie.Often, one might judge their desire to see a movie by the actors/actresses who play the leading roles.  That was certainly not true here.  Diaz and Kurt Russell have been very entertaining in many films. Although I have never been a huge fan of Tom Cruise, I have thoroughly enjoyed many films in which he played.

852,flagger14,Vanilla lifted to cinematic Godliness is still Vanilla,5,18 December 2001,"Contains Spoilers David Aames (Tom Cruise) is a Casanova-about-town: a young, rich, handsome, and fashionable New Yorker who inherits the lucrative family business at a tender age--although his wealth could be snatched from him if he loses his ability to function rationally. Few boundaries seem to limit his lust for life, wine, women, and song (especially women). David's future seems etched in purest gold, just as his heart and sentiments appear to be fabricated of the cheapest plastic.Everything goes wrong when Julie (Cameron Diaz), AKA his ""love-making buddy"" (er, that's an elegant facsimile of the cruder term used in the script) decides to take exception to his recently-acquired affection for Sofia (Penélope Cruz).  In particular, Julie feels compelled to drive like a maniac, eventually smashing her car into a stone wall.  Unfortunately our hero David's in the passenger's seat.  Result: she's dead, and he has to bear dreadfully disfiguring physical and emotional scars for the rest of his life.When David first meets Sophia, this appears as if it might turn into an odd version of a ""10"" knockoff (with Cruz as Bo Derek). After the car accident, we have the sense that David will somehow transform himself, now that he's not so stunningly handsome anymore: as if Dorian Gray could somehow experience an afterlife as Mother Teresa.But Dorian Gray was genuinely evil: David's just a spoiled rich playboy-cad. Nevertheless, the script tantalizingly teases our hopes that perhaps this is a story about true love and redemption. But things soon go from bad to worse, as we realize that much of the movie is told from in retrospective from his view--while incarcerated for murder (the supposed victim turns out to be Cruz, not Diaz).After that, things begin to go haywire to an even greater extent. Tom Cruise's character goes to a restaurant and _wills_ the patrons to stop talking.  He makes love to Cruz and sees Diaz after he climaxes.  Other events occur that make the viewer feel utterly bereft of the capability to discriminate between reality and imagination.  By this time (about halfway through the 2-1/2 hour film), we've long since noticed that protagonist himself has lost that ability.  But, why?  Is his apparent madness the result of a plot to disinherit him?Unfortunately, the subject of ""Vanilla Sky"" isn't crime or intrigue.  Nor is it an uplifting story about true love, loss and redemption, and/or self-discovery.  For one thing. at most Cruz (Sophia) and possibly David's superfluous side-kick (Brian, played flawlessly by Jason Lee) appear to either possess--or acquire--even the tiniest hint of genuinely interesting character development.And whatever ""arty"" feel that Cameron Crowe (director and script writer) may have desired turns out to be utterly dispelled by a disappointingly thin and uninteresting plot.  The only thing that holds your attention is the question of how the provided clues could actually produce a plausible result (actually the depicted events are barely believable to all but the hardest-core sci-fi fans).When the ending is revealed, you walk away disappointed--as if you'd gone to a fancy restaurant boasting elegant decor, servers with French accents, and no prices on the menu ... only to find a high-end version of a Big Mac shamelessly dripping grease all over the edge of your Bone China plate, onto the fancy linen tablecloth below.Yes, the acting is excellent.  The music is compelling. The cinematography is wonderful.  Even the script has more than its share of witty moments. (Although this reviewer believes that Cruise should've been yelling ""Get me rewrite!"" instead of ""Tech support!"" at one key moment towards the film's end.)This film may be worth seeing if you like the actors, and you don't allow yourself to be taken in by the expectations that it raises and mercilessly dashes.  Vanilla dreams--even when lifted heavenward--are doomed to be first-class bores.  And if there was ever a guilded dandelion, this flick is it.",Vanilla Sky

This gimmick doesn't work.I had read that the movie had all sorts of twists and turns, so I was prepared to pay attention and really think about what was going on during the course of the 2+ hour film.  After what seemed like forever, I looked my watch and noticed time tick, tick, ticking away while few answers had been given for the nonsense being played out on the screen.  I keep thinking that the movie wasn't going to be long enough to clean up the mess and finally give the audience the final pieces of the puzzle.  It turns out the film didn't need to be any longer, it just needed to be over with because it wasn't going anywhere.Even a highbrow movie needs to make sense when it's all said and done.

With the exception of the saccharine charm of the ever-so-coy Ms. Cruz, cast and script are immensely appealing. Although film is abstract in the very ways that the Monet David shows to Sophia is not, it's an interesting puzzle of a film, leaving you with more questions than answers, touching on a multitude of themes including: What is love? How important is external beauty to achieving love?

This film was an interesting move for Cruise and Crowe, especially Crowe whose films include Almost Famous and Jerry Maguire. For a movie called Vanilla Sky (which describes how Monet painted his skies) I was expecting a more surreal experience. The dream sequences didn't blend well and can leave the audience scratching their heads. With its large budget they could have taken more use of computer effects to give a truly dreamlike feel. Instead it can feel more like just another murder mystery then the intended journey of the mind. The ending, one of the most hyped parts of the film isn't a new concept and has been used in multiple earlier movies. This doesn't mean I disliked the ending, quite the contrary; it fit the film well and added a whole new dimension to the film. Crowe's look at how pop culture affects our lives and the way it affects our personal views of happiness was masterfully done, especially in the intro of Tom Cruise running through a deserted Time Square. It is impossible to review Vanilla Sky without mentioning the amazing assortment of music laced throughout the film. Each song fits perfectly with each scene whether its Radiohead's Everything in its Right Place or Peter Gabriel's Salisbury Hill. Crowe did an excellent job of choosing a collage of different music, which sets the changing moods of each scene. Was this film as mind blowing as the advertisements say it will be? Not quite. It is hard to advertise this type of film properly. The commercials gave away key parts of the film, which were less effective after seeing them on television a dozen times. Plus the viewer may just ignore the film altogether and not enjoy the ride just waiting for the ending. It is hard for a movie to live up to the hype of (what I believe) is the best movie trailer ever. Not every scene was effective, but Vanilla Sky's concept and attempts to take you somewhere new make it a personal classic. Grade: A-",Vanilla Sky

It takes on elements of romance, character study, dream voyage, and sci-fi. Perhaps a heady mix some would rather not do with. But I loved it. It's a strong, risky performance by Cruise who takes us on a journey through one man's mind and soul as he tries to figure out who he is amidst all the loneliness and confusion. He's a man engulfed in wealth and power who ends up stripped of everything and awash in dream and pop culture. It reminded me of the movie THE GAME by way of WAKING LIFE.

The good ones are either written in a way that you are more emotionally involved with the characters and plots. Like in Memento, you could actually feel what Guy Pierce's character was going through with his ""condition"". In Vanilla... and Eternal..., you could actually see their pain and the lengths they were going through to try to be with their lovers! Bottom line, Vanilla Sky is not your typical love story or 'chic flick' and if you have no imagination or aren't a hopeless romantic, then do not bother watching it. If you do and you are, you should fall in love with the characters and the story itself. You'll probably end up buying the DVD as well.",Vanilla Sky

As the film progresses it becomes more and more interesting, probing further into the mind of the lead, and increasingly disorientating viewer.However, it conveniently wraps up everything into a neat little package unlikely to offend or affect anyone. A terrible terrible terrible finale.During the first and second acts, the film poses questions about vanity, sanity, morality and reality, and answers them with the modern equivalent of the oldest cliche ending in the book - ""it was all a dream"" for the 21st century. The dream is replaced with a ridiculous science fiction get-out which has no relevance to the preceding film. And the resulting subject matter of virtual reality and cryogenics has been done better, with more point, more depth and more humour on TV drama and sit-coms for the last 15 years. Quite what this 2001 movie thought it could bring to the subject I fail to see. Some creative person behind this movie spent a long time writing themselves into a labyrinth of a story, and as deadline day loomed clearly saw they had no way of getting out.",Vanilla Sky
866,nativelablnde,"Keep the money, give me back my time.",1,3 January 2002,"I found the film a disappointment.  Slow moving. Crowe leads the viewer to believe the film is a psychological thriller and takes the audience through a maze of tiring love scenes accompanied by one hit wonder songs.  The big payoff at the end is that IT IS a science fiction film...a ""lucid dream"". ""Total Recall"" instantly comes to mind as Russell and Cruise enter a company called ""Life Extension"".  Cameron Diaz's smile however is worth the price of any ticket...too bad her role had to be that of a nut.",Vanilla Sky

868,Windowlicker2000,One of the worst remakes ever,1,26 August 2002,"Okay, my expectations were not very high for this movie, as the original ""Abre Los Ojos/Open Your Eyes"" was one of my favourite movies ever. But if (at all) there was a point in copying a great European movie with Hollywood-actors, one could have done a lot better than that.Disturbing and violent scenes are shortened and moderated, the free space is used for more typical Hollywood-style high-polished pictures and Cruise-smiling (who seems to be no different from any other character from his movies). Even Penelope Cruz (who plays the same woman as in the original) appears pale and lifeless in comparison to her great performance in ""Abre Los Ojos"".I can only highly recommend the 1997 original version, which was a great cinematic experience, but in ""Vanilla Sky"", what's left is a soulless print from a Hollywood-copy-shop.",Vanilla Sky
869,ckmwa,Excellent Film,10,5 January 2002,"I just saw Vanilla Sky and have read many of the reviews on this board. Basically they fall into two categories. You will either love it or hate it. I loved it. If you like movies that make you think and keep you guessing as to what really happened then you will like this movie. If you need things clearly laid out and crystal clear you probably won't like this one.Days after having seen this movie I am still thinking about it. I can't wait for it to come out in DVD so I can see it again and normally I don't like seeing a movie twice. I would rate this as probably one of the best two or three movies of the year.SPOILERIt basically come down to was it a dream, or was it real.

I could have guessed that Tom Cruise had a hand in directing the film, as I have come to shy away from movies where the actors have anything to do with the writing or production of the film.  Tom Cruise should stick to ""Pretty Boy"" roles and leave the arty roles to someone with real acting ability.  The best part of this movie was when it was over.",Vanilla Sky

The one was ""Stir of Echoes"" with Kevin Bacon, and the second was ""Vanilla Sky"".Its one of those movies that you sit deep in the theater seat and stop thinking about anyone around you, stop wondering what the end of the movie will be and just leave the movie swift you where it wants... Walking out of the cinema was a bit weird, like that feeling you get when you are sick and cant think of anything. One of those movies that you become one with the guy, and feel that nothing else moves around you than the things in the movie.One thing is certain.

the spanish film, abre los ojos, of which vanilla sky is a remake, is the opposite however.  i was completely wrapped up in cesar's (david in vanilla sky)pain and frustration.  eduardo noriega did a much better job of playing the handsome, rich, playboy cum psychiatric patient with little/fuzzy memory, than tom cruise did.  at the end of abre los ojos, i completely bought every plot twist and turn. . .as for vanilla sky, i just couldn't bring myself to care.",Vanilla Sky
878,andyireland,The Anti-Shrek of our times,1,28 January 2002,"Despite protestations mid way through the film the big message that you take home with your popcorn box is that beautiful = good, ugly = sad and mad!! A message that narcisistic egomaniacs obsessed with the mirror have some sort of right to longevity. I wriggled first with discomfort over the nasty taste this was giving me and rising to a full blown mouth of bile over the ""twist"".The clunking metaphors were almost to much to bear (mask on back of head etc) and a very detailed explanation of David's true life was something out of a VERY bad SciFi short. And as for the disfigurements of Cruise (""amazing"" prostehetics) which were to haunt David through his life and dreams - I think I've had worst shaving cuts!The leads were perfunctory in there acting. Diaz looked better in Shrek, Cruise gunning for ""can't act but sure can grin"" stardom and Cruz, though undoubtably stunning, twitched her way through her lines with the manner of a lost tourist in Times square struggling to understand a word of a new and lucrative language.I really wish they would have turned into ogres and got down with rest of us uglies.",Vanilla Sky
879,sixtyseven,Close Your Eyes,8,26 January 2002,"There's not a lot to say about this film. Really, there isn't. If you don't really understand it, you may call it ""ingeniously provocative"" or ""appealingly philosophical"" or any other term that will make you look intelligent. People look for an explanation and come up with plots so complex that it makes the whole thing look silly. Really silly. The actual clue here, is that there is none.This is art, ladies and gentlemen. Art in disguise, in the world of massive consumption media. It's a composition of ideas interweaving and merging into each other. Just like Monet's painting shown in the picture, featuring the 'vanilla sky', it is an impression of reality. You have to look at it the way you look back at a dream you've just woken up from. Some parts are still clear in your memory, while others have already begun to fade out of your mind. And the whole - well - makes no real sense at all. Or if you believe that dreams have a meaning, it can make any sense you would want it to have.
Vanilla Sky is like one of Monet's paintings. When you examine his works at close range, they will look like assemblies of random brush strokes; as if the artist wanted to paint a surreal landscape. However, if you take a few steps back (or like in my case: simply take off your glasses), you will see the colours flow into each other and something will start to take shape inside your own imagination. Something really familiar. Monet wants to depict landscapes; he describes them with colour, so that we can make up their form ourselves.Hold on to that thought, and use it to look at Vanilla Sky. Everything in it has a purpose and yet, nothing has a meaning on its own. See it as a whole, but don't be disappointed if it would turn out that the whole makes no sense to you either. What Vanilla Sky wants to depict is life; it describes it with images, so that we can reflect them on our own lives.
It's all about impression.To conclude this review, I'd like to make one last remark. You can't really rate this film. You can't say that it's good, because it is NOT good. And you can't say it's bad either, because in a way, that's what it tries to be. Sweet and sour. What you can do, is decide whether you like it, or not. And to be honest with you, I didn't like it. It did bore me at times and I really don't like to be bored inside a movie theater (especially not when the movie has already started). On the other hand, I don't regret seeing it. Now that the movie is over, I'm starting to appreciate it. It's an attempt of using Hollywood to bring art to the masses, without Hollywood being fully aware of it.Open Your Eyes",Vanilla Sky

A photo gallery, and trailers. Interesting.I have gone back and read some reviews on the film, with a reoccuring theme that audiences left wanting answers.  I do not proclaim now, or in the past, to be a ""film"" expert.  But I ""got"" the film.  Of course background filler would always be interesting, but I was very satisfied with my viewing experience.Is the film to long that viewers actually do not have the attention span to follow it through?

I was totally blown away by   the  movie and especially TC's performance, I thought it was a very moving film and it was not at all what I was expecting.I had read the reviews and had decided not to go and see it, I am so pleased that I  was 'coerced 'into seeing it. The strange thing is I cannot say why, all I can say is that I found it totally involving and could not stop thinking about it the next day. As to what I felt about the film, all I can say about is, ITS NOT THE STORYLINE (fantasy, psychodrama, whatever) its about the people and the events that shape their life and how small events, like getting into a car can change everything......As to what the critics wrote, yes maybe the original was a stunning 2nd film for Alejandro Amenábar , but this was a totally different interpretation of the subject, and by no means a narcissistic remake for the benefit of Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz.I cannot even consider writing a couple of trite, glib sentences  to describe the film just go and see it!!!!Yes I know this isn't a balanced thoughtful review but so what .It's not that kind of film.",Vanilla Sky

However, I left the cinema completely in awe of how good Vanilla Sky is.There was no bad acting at all in the whole film, every single character is believable.  The romantic moments between Cruise's character, David Aames and Cruz's character, Sophia are tear-jerkingly realistic and intimate (probably due to the fact that they were a soon-to-be real-life couple).The plot of Vanilla Sky will confuse you in the last third of the film and there's very little chance of you guessing the ending.  However, ends are tied up towards the end, leaving you with a strange mixture of feelings consisting of sadness, shock and empathy for David Aames.The film is intellectual and you have to pay attention throughout.  This isn't that hard because chances are that you'll be completely drawn in to the film and won't take your eyes off the screen for one second.I usually leave cinemas forgetting all about the film I just watch.

The soundtrack to this movie is also excellent, as is the acting. There are very little flaws to this movie - it easily deserves to be on the top 250, especially when something like Grindhouse manages to be voted in the top 100 films of all time...what a terrible shame. Vanilla sky is very clever, it is NOT too absurd; it completely makes sense once you understand it. The only reasons people may hate this film is because 1) They don't understand the plot. 2) They just don't like Tom Cruise (or his character) 3) They are an ignoramus.

889,jfontainhas,Pathetic,2,4 February 2002,"This is a pathetic movie, for two reasons:a) having seen Amenabar's original ""Abre Los Ojos"" before ""Vanilla Sky"", one can see, after just a few minutes, that the american version just isn't going to reach the depth, simplicity and elegance of the original. This movie falls prey to the temptation of big-star movies where everybody's handsome and apparently dressed by Vogue's fashion coordinators. The story, of course, suffers. It's a pity that 90% of movie-goers will get to know this story as told by Crowe and not by Amenabar.b) Penelope Cruz just isn't a good actress. It's amazing that she'd agree to play the exact same part in the remake. Did she count on nobody knowing Amenaber's version? (Curiously i have to admit that Tom Cruise plays the part with the delicacy and intensity it deserves, and I don't even like him...). It seems as if Crowe bowed before the Cruz-Cruise soap opera and let her do whatever she wanted. Contrast with her part in Almodovar's ""Todo sobre mi madre"", and you'll get a glimpse of what a good director can do even with mediocre actress material.Was this a trade-off between Cruise amd Amenabar?

Mine: the original movie is better. Why? The story is more exciting and with more suspense (yes, even with the same script!), the end is less obvious and more surprising, and the music fits better every image. Actors: better too. No doubt with Penelope Cruz. Amenabar filmed his script and the result is incredible. Crowe have just put additional special effects and more music (which doesn't fit at all).Case b). Go and see Abre los ojos. It's worth it!! You will discover how the story was told by the writer.Case c). You can save your money. You won't find anything better in this new release. It is exactly the same, but without the personal touch of Amenabar.Case d). No doubt. First of all, Abre los ojos, one of the most intelligent films I have ever seen.

893,jonpenfold,one watcher's perspective...,10,11 February 2002,"... it was with a sense of anticipation that i settled in to my seat to see Vanilla Sky. whilst appreciating Cameron Crowe's earlier films for the watchable enterprises that they have been, i had never found myself as being particularly emotionally drawn to them; previous dialogue had a tendency for mawkish sentimentality (almost famous), and occasional over repetition ( jerry macguire). also, in many of his films, the director has a tendency to become bogged down in the semi-autobiographical nature of his works - note the fawning self-appreciation of his younger self in almost famous, or the ridiculous amount of time that kate hudson spends enigmatically staring into the camera!!it was with a pleasant sense of surprise then, that i found vanilla sky to be one of the most emotionally affecting films that i have seen for a long time. the director manages to accurately convey on screen a real sense of tom cruise and penelope cruz actually falling in love. this is not done with undue sentimentalisation, but through heavy focus on music and its nostalgic qualities, as well as standing back from the viewer, rather than ramming sentiment down their throat. performances are excellent throughout, even from cruise, who manages to downplay his role effectively for the most part. diaz, on the other hand, looks as good as ever on screen (i.e. unbelievably beautiful!!), and puts in a good performance to boot. cruz is warmer and more beguiling than i had anticipated, and as mentioned, her and cruise fall in love extremely convincingly (and we all know why that is)!!the soundtrack is another absolute highlight of the film and conveys its emotional highs and lows brilliantly. icelandic band sigur ros are the undisputed highlights, and if their song at the films denoument doesn't fill your eyes with tears, then you really need a new record collection.

I'm surprised that it isn't in at least top 250 and that also the overall rating is low. The film is great because of more than just one thing, many factors add in to it like the music some of the scenery and just the overall look of the film.

Ames (Tom Cruise) has no morality or integrity, and is surrounded by other characters (Cameron Diaz) of similar bent. At times, such movies can still hold my interest if the plot creates issues of some importance. Unfortunately, the movie fails to deliver here as well since director Cameron Crowe has created a Lynch-like glob of glue that only held my interest briefly. The movie's only saving grace is the cinematography, especially, an erie morning drive to Times Square and the opening scenes of New York City from the air. Otherwise... forgetaboutit.",Vanilla Sky
896,VirginiaBeld,Sweet and Sour Cinema: Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky,8,16 July 2007,"The film Vanilla Sky was adapted for American audiences from a Spanish foreign film called Abre Los Ojos meaning open your eyes. Cameron Crowe writes the screenplay and directs this americanized version. Vanilla Sky provides an A-list cast including Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz,Cameron Diaz, Jason Lee, and Kurt Russell. The movie details a series of very strange events in the life of thirty-something, spoiled publishing tycoon David Aames, played by Tom Cruise. Brian Shelby,played by actor Jason Lee, is his best friend and a source of reason and wisdom for David. Juliana Gianni, played by Cameron Diaz, becomes very jealous and possessive of David after he blows off their casual sexual relationship to pursue the romantic affections of Sophia Serrano, played by actress Penelope Cruz. Through these events David Aames begins to realize that something is wrong with the world and finds out he is only too right but in a way so strange and surprising that it challenges the imagination. Cameron Crowe makes excellent use of dialog, symbolism, and structure to support the film's key concepts and themes. He also makes use of them by hiding clues to the overall mystery throughout the film in the dialog and in visual symbolism. Crowe presents many valid points through the themes and concepts concerning the importance of dreams, desires, and the human mind.The use of dialog and symbolism to reveal subtle clues to the viewer can be found throughout Vanilla Sky. Throughout the entire film people keep telling David to wake up or open his eyes, inferring the he is sleeping or not really awake. Aames refers to his company's board members as the seven dwarfs which would make him Snow White who fell into a deep sleep after eating a poison apple in the children's story Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. This becomes more relevant later when it is revealed that David overdoses on his medications in order to end his real life so that he may begin his lucid dream in cryo-stasis. In one scene Sophia asks David if this is all a dream and he replies absolutely though they mean in reference to the state of post-relations bliss they are both enjoying at the time. The psychologist character, played by Kurt Russell, asks David during his interview if he knows the difference between dreams and reality. Several clues lie hidden within the visuals of the film and are symbols of their hidden meanings. The Monet painting in Aames' apartment is called Vanilla Sky, and after the night David passes out in the street the real sky itself becomes like that of the painting signifying where the lucid dream begins. Many times in the film Life Exstension, cryogenics, and a thawed out dog named Benny are either discussed directly by the characters or by others on televisions being watched by the characters, this is David's sub-conscious piecing together memories supposedly erased by the Life Exstension process. In this way Crowe shows how David's memories of his former real life begin to bleed through becoming mixed with those created solely within the lucid dream. Crowe uses these devices to give the viewer subliminal glimpses of the true nature of the plot.There are many themes and key concepts in regard to life, dreams, and the human mind in this film. Two of the more prominent re-occurring lines in Vanilla Sky are ""the sweet is never as sweet without the sour"" and ""every minute that passes is a chance to turn it all around"". The first phrase is a piece of sage advice given to David by his friend Brian on several different occasions. The writer may be making an assertion to life in general, but also regarding the relationship between the waking world and that of dreams. Perhaps Crowe wishes to express that dreams are a form of escapism for us from the harsh real world. The second phrase is repeated throughout the film to David by several people. It can also be seen as a generic statement about life and taking advantage of second chances, but more specifically it is advice given to David when he begins to despair or become afraid of the chaos, confusion, and insanity he is experiencing. This is meant as a trigger to remind his sub-conscious that he can call for help from tech support at any moment. The phrase in the dialog, ""the sub-conscious is a powerful thing"", can be considered the central concept for the film as a whole. Within the film it answers the how question of what is really happening to David Aames. Externally the film uses similar techniques, playing on the sub-conscious of the viewer by subtly manipulating the style and structure in coherence with the themes of the story.Cameron Crowe takes advantage of his role as the director and screenplay adapter by incorporating into the film's style and structure key elements to the conceptual nature of the film itself. The film's style was somewhat surreal with the colors being more vibrant after the lucid dream splice had taken place. The structure and flow of the film is helpful in projecting the feeling of dreams. Much like a lot of real dreams the story jumps around within the plot's time line but keeps an overall forward motion. Also, like in dreams, there are instances of lines that do not fit or make sense in the context that they are spoken. Many of these random lines are meant to be clues, such as ""this is a revolution of the mind"", spoken randomly to David by a man he passes by in the hall of the police station. This is reminiscent of how dialog in dreams doesn't always make sense in the context of the dreams themselves. Crowe uses these types of techniques to make the movie experience that much more psychologically interactive for the viewer; to truly transport them into the world of Vanilla Sky, a world of dreams.",Vanilla Sky

There are plenty of soundtracks out there but vanilla sky offers a really good and quality tracklist, perfectly shaped into the movie if you know what i mean... The movie itself is really good. At first, when i saw it in the movie theatre i didn't really like it because something wasn't clear to me - as a matter of fact is a quite strange movie - the second time i saw it well i enjoyed it! That's all folks,See ya",Vanilla Sky
900,tbssurf,"Excellent film, except...",7,2 November 2007,"I have but one quarrel with this film, the make-up of Cruise after the accident. The story, the acting, the twists, the beginning, the end... All fantastic. However, when cruise is at the bar and says to the tender,""Say it to my face bitch."" That just seemed kind of... stupid. That and his goofy dancing that causes him to look mentally handicapped as well. I do understand it's purpose, he has become a helpless shut-in, but it just seems to be trying to hard right there.That is my only dislike of this entire film. It is an extremely moving piece with many strong points. I plan to buy it soon.",Vanilla Sky
901,cybernet,An Interpretation of the Film's Ideas and Feelings,10,14 May 2002,"The film captured me in ways I had not thought possible.  The nightmare of Vanilla Sky caused me to reflect on myself and see the glory of each moment passing in my own life.Vanilla Sky takes surprising twists and turns throughout the film, effectively, but intentionally, confusing the audience.  The film requires those who watch it to reinterpret everything they have just seen.  The effective use of flashbacks and flashforwards blur the film in its parts, but allow intensify the film in its whole.I found the sound elements a plus in this film.  The use of artists such as Bob Dylan gave me a feeling of wonder and amazement.  Peter Gabriel's Solsbury Hill was repeated in the film, causing me to sense a connection between the two scenes it could be heard.  The most intense parts of the film included a montage of images and sound, mixing various songs from the film, lines the characters said, as well as noises I have been unable to identify.  This type of segment most striking to me was one that included the Solsbury Hill song.All in all, Vanilla Sky is a 10 on my list.  The film invoked much feeling inside of me, and the story was convincing to me, although I know a small group of people will actually be convinced of the film's plot.  I am one who finds ideas and meanings in films more important than the entertainment it brings, so my opinion is quite biased in that respect.",Vanilla Sky
902,iggs,Had to say something after so long,9,3 July 2015,"I came to Vanilla Sky from the original Abre los Ojos that I chanced across late one night on UK TV. Since then I've never watched the original again (not for any reason other than I've just not got round to it) but have seen Vanilla Sky many times. It really is a bittersweet film evoking a range of emotions and leaves me full of both joy and sadness in equal measures at its end. It really is a film that rewards re-watching to see the many layers and to help understand why there are so many 'theories' about what's going on other than what you see on the screen before you. I've never understood the hate this film gets, other than it's a 'Tom Cruise' film and the negativity that seems to engender. and I've recommended it many times to friends. As I write this I realise that I've never watched it with anyone, if you've seen it I hope you'll understand that I probably, unlike many films I rave about, never will.",Vanilla Sky

After seeing it we went and bought it, and we also bought the original Abre Los Ojos. (Open Your Eyes)The original is great as well, but we both like Vanilla Sky better. (and my wife is from Spain!)Cameron Diaz was much more believable, and Cruse and Cruz were also more believable as a couple.This is not a movie for the lazy or boring. Pay attention and you will love it. Those who don't get it, probably don't get a lot of things.",Vanilla Sky
904,pistonsrip,Simply amazing,9,25 May 2008,"I went into the movie expecting a drama/romance. Instead I got an incredibly deep psychological thriller/drama with one of the coolest twists and the best ending ever. Well, maybe not the best, but it was REALLY good. The acting is great, on everyone's part. Cruise is great, Diaz is good in her little part, and Cruz does a great job or portraying a ""true lover"". I'm still in awe of the quality of the movie. It will make you feel happy and then sad, jump for joy or just cry tears of happiness. Be warned, the movie is not for children. Lots of language and a pretty intense and disturbing scene near the end. But still, go watch it now.",Vanilla Sky

Now since I live and breathe movies, I should have given it a fair shot myself. But I didn't. I waited until it came out at my local Blockbuster and then I settled down with my two friends.As the movie unfolded, I found that I could not tear my eyes away from the screen. I felt as if I wasn't sitting in my apartment, but in a dark corner of main character David Aames' mind. After it was over, I thought, ""What the hell was my roommate thinking? That was amazing!"" I was just about to vocalize this when my friend to the left said, ""I didn't like it. It was confusing."" I couldn't believe my ears! Hadn't they just watched the same movie I had? Impossible, otherwise they'd be raving about Crowe's brilliance. Well, I say this movie is simply mind blowing. From the moment it begins you're drawn into this other world, where the line between dreams and reality is blurred. Not everyone will like it. I called my parents: ""We just watched it. I liked it, your mother said it was the stupidest sh*t I've made her watch."" So there you have it. It all depends on the individual. I stayed up nights reading the script and thinking about it. The next day I watched it again-three times. I hope the same for you. In any case, just watch it",Vanilla Sky

Possibly the best film of 2001, surreal dramas don't get much better than this. I would urge anyone with an arty appreciation of film to watch this.Be warned mainstream viewers who just want to sit back and relax with their popcorn will not enjoy this film as it is profoundly complex in terms of narratve. Once you've seen it once you will instantly want to see it again just to make sure you understood it, much like 'Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind'.

So I watched it again and started to see the richness of the subtle details.  Now I'm a believer.  I love this film. I love everything about it. I like the way it looks.  I like the way it sounds.  I even like the way it's packaged, so sue me. But most of all I like its simple little message: open your eyes.  One part love story, two parts mysterty and two parts mind candy.

The Movie itself is very intriguing with all its psychological overtones and a good project for Crowe to stretch his directing abilities but what this movie really shows is that there really is Acting ability in Tom Cruise (Something he attempted to do in ""Eyes Wide Shut""). There is also another very Good performance in this movie by psychologist Kurt Russell who is a very under rated actor.",Vanilla Sky
909,joe_muller,Relatively Pointless Remake,4,2 August 2008,"First of all, I have to say that this is actually not a bad movie. I even have to admit, that I found it quite amazing, after I watched it for the first time, and later for three or four other times. I also heard about the fact, that this is a remake of a Spanish movie, ""Abre los Ojos"", which has been made only four years before. But because ""Abre los Ojos"" is probably in most countries less famous than the high budget Hollywood remake, it took some time, since I saw the original movie for the first time.After I did, I realized, that ""Vanilla Sky"" obviously includes some of the strong ideas of ""Abre los Ojos"" and converted them somehow nice. It actually follows the dramaturgy of ""Abre los Ojos"" almost(!!) 1:1, camera work and light is technically very good as most high budget blockbuster movies are......and at least Paul McCartney wrote and performed a quite nice song for the credits, which is worth listening at......but in my opinion, ""Vanilly Sky"" goes over the top in most stylistic subjects (e.g. music also), maybe just to challenge the original movie anyhow or - I don't know. I can not see any reason why they decided to bring in these pointless music montages and the long dialog explanation and, as I think, one-dimensional interpretation of the events for the spectator at the end by this strange character ""Ed Ventura"" (played by Noah Taylor).My main point is, that ""Vanilla Sky"" missed the chance to come to any relevant or interesting conclusions about the social important subjects of media or psychology, which were part of the heart of the original script. Instead of this, director Cameron Crowe and leading role actor and co-producer Tom Cruise were looking for more metaphysical and religious aspects and changed the ending of the original movie ideologically, which is, in my opinion, much less interesting than in ""Abre los Ojos"".I don't say, that a remake has to be automatically worse than the original, but it should bring in any relevant or innovative aspects, which ""Vanilly Sky"" hardly does.Altogether on one hand an interesting movie, which on the other hand is not really worth to watch, if you already know the original. ""Vanilla Sky's"" strongest contents already existed in ""Abre los Ojos"".""Abre los Ojos"" - 8/10 ""Vanilla Sky"" - 4/10",Vanilla Sky
910,gruntree,Great Tom,8,1 March 2008,"Mejor a la original. Better than original Spanish. I feel good when look at the movie again, and again. The movie, it follows his protagonist, but Tom Cruise, does that the movie is in almost his totality, great personification, impresses the image in which it discovers that it is cheated by his friend. His adjustment of script, it is very good, this air of Spanish cheap art of the original movie, does not convince me, you prop the voice and the Spanish accent (of Spain) is disagreeable. I share that the director Alejandro Amenabar was nice, but Cameron Crowe, not for nothing win the Oscar the previous year, permission inspired by hi victory. Really Tom did an effort in the adjustment and I manage fully, the awaited result, though it is not a fabulous movie as for script, it(he,she) does not stop impressing a couple of scenes when I see her, excellent",Vanilla Sky

It shows us how we can manipulate our surroundings and the way we view life using our memories. We can either create a wonderland or a nightmare. But the movie explains that neither of these lead to true fulfillment because we are only truly happy when we risk it all and really EXPERIENCE life. When we all want to live a real life all we need to do is stop thinking, open our eyes and LIVE.

913,rrmacrr,Challenging but intriguing,8,16 August 2002,"I found this movie to be in turn challenging, frustrating and intriguing. I did feel manipulated by the director, Cameron Crowe, but that is his job. Tom Cruise did a solid job as David Aames, not quite as good as in Minority Report.  Penelope Cruz showed limited range, but did have good chemistry with Tom (which later continued offscreen.)  Jason Lee was excellent as David's best friend, as was Cameron Diaz as his sometime lover Julie. Kurt Russell was fair as David's psychiatrist. I found the ending a little too tidy.  Maybe I should see it again to truly judge it.  I would have rather have solved the mystery through the story. The use of music was effective for the most part. The eclectic soundtrack mirrored Cruise's confusion. I was disturbed by the characters' lack of spiritual awareness.  There was no questioning of God by David at any time during his ordeal. That just accentuated his superficiality.  Sophia, meaning ""divine wisdom"" was supposed to fill that void in his life.  That could have been better developed.  The movie could have been edited better, especially in the first half.  I'd say it is most similar to the Matrix and the Sixth Sense, which deal with similar themes of ontology.",Vanilla Sky

915,purdurabo,the unhappy consumer,1,17 August 2002,"I'm having difficulty deciding whether to beat my head against the wall or bother to criticize yet another piece of soulless Hollywood entertainment/distraction.  As more of the world sinks into poverty, starvation and despair, and this country rapidly transforms itself into a hyper militarized Rome, what more could we expect from that great engine of propaganda (that Hollywood unwittingly is) than one more slick lifestyles of the rich and famous in search of relief from the tedium of the idle rich.Oh but the world needs entertainment, or is it that the world needs distraction from the evil sheet that's going down.  Bread and circuses didn't hold a candle to video.Oh well on a more specific note this was a mediocrely crafted  psychedelic version of The Game (another waste of time) with a sort of Crowlian twist, and you either see what a sad soulless mess Crowley was or you idolize him as he idolized himself .  Crowley, like Freud, in attempting to kill the mean-spirited Judeo-Christian God only wound up letting his own angry unexamined little psyche take his/her place. Ah but I diverge from the divergence that my subject of deriding this movie, or was it `civilization' is; well, either way they both suffer from the same preoccupation with uber wealth, high-tech toys and the fantasy that science will save us from our own mortality and/or our or society's unethical choices.So, `Turning and turning in the widening gyre....'  Its not the sheep that deserve condemnation, for they are for the most part only sheep/victims.

The music plays well with the film and it all creates a very scary/beautiful movie.Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise. Can he play any other character. I have yet to see it.Cameron Diaz is a bit unsettling in this movie. She plays great. Scary character.Penélope Cruz is wonderful.

No matter how confusing you may find the plot, just go with the flow, safe in the knowledge that ALL will be revealed.Vanilla Sky is a complete visual and audio experience.  Memorable dialogue and music.  After watching the film, I felt like running out to buy the soundtrack!  Peter Gabriel's Solsbury Hill never sounded so good and even The Beach Boys Good Vibrations took on a new lease of life.
All the leads are excellent, but Tom Cruise gives a tour de force performance. I became completely caught up in his anguish and confusion.Watch out for the Times Square sequence at the beginning of the film.  It was an unnerving experience for both Tom Cruise and myself and gave a good foretaste of the suspense and mystery to follow.I have watched the film three times so far, and am still finding new things in it.  Vanilla Sky has generated much debate in my household  regarding the messages the film is giving out.I concur with a newspaper film reviewer who said: If you see one film this year, make it Vanilla Sky.",Vanilla Sky

Fleshing out some characters and backstory.Cameron Diaz plays her part very well as a stalker. Penelope Cruz the link between both films walks through her role with ease. Although im not a big Tom Cruise fan, this film alone opened up a new door of respect to his acting talents and proving he is just not a smile upon the camera. If you have ever been in love with a person that somehow vanished from your life this film will be a real treat for you.So open your eyes and watch this movie. You will not regret it.",Vanilla Sky
920,drgraffin,"One of my favorite, if not favorite movie of all time.",10,24 December 2008,"Amongst all of the other comments, I'm sure mine will get lost, but this movie is so great on so many levels, I felt I needed to underline/restate some important ideas regarding this film.First, being why it wasn't widely accepted as a truly remarkable film. I think this is for a few reasons which would be: it's a remake of a Spanish film, it has Tom Cruise as the star, and the entire plot is based around sci-fi fantasy. These points are all ridiculous reasons to ignore the greatness of this film. Number one, show me a film that doesn't have some relation to some other film or book created before it. Number two, while Cruise is a weirdo, that doesn't mean he can't make good films and this is probably his best. And three, sci-fi plays with your imagination. Some people I guess like their movies all based in today's reality, which is sad. BAsically, some people don't like to think about what-ifs, only the what is. So with these notions out of the way, why is the movie so wonderful, and honestly a classic film?I can't say it better than everyone else has already said it, but I'll try. The philosophical ideas brought up throughout the film, the unique plot twists and turns, and climactic ending which only ties all the loose ends together as the film ends wastes no time throughout the movie; it is only after the entire story is told, the movie ends. Now that's drama. That's story telling. With careful listening and observation, you can you detect hints throughout the movie. The whole story unfolds before your eyes as a viewer, though it's up to you how you interpret what's going on, based on what you know and don't know. This is the whole idea the movie is built around (We create our own realities), and it is played out in how the movie is filmed,directed, and told. The cinematography, the soundtrack, the acting, the plot, everything comes together to create one hell of an engrossing ride.In closing, if you leave after a first viewing not understanding what happened or things didn't quite make sense, please do yourself the favor of seeing it again. If a person can't appreciate this movie, I honestly don't know what else you could be looking for in a film.P.S. Some other poster said if you love Vanilla Sky, you'll probably love Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. How right he is!!!

He writes, compose music (rememeber The Others) and do a hard working in every movie he makes so I think the merit of this great plot is for Amenabar.

It is incredible in every way; from the actors, to the music, to the cinematography. Some people seem to hate this movie very much, and the reason for this is because they completely missed out on the message and the plot. I will admit that the first time I watched the movie; I was lost and got frustrated for not understanding. But that's what Crowe wanted, and when the movie ended, i was very satisfied with the movie.I then watched the movie a 2nd time, and the movie had truly become my favourite movie of all time (and still is). The last scene encompasses so many deep emotions and is simply a work of art. This scene makes the movie simply beautiful and perfect. If you've seen the movie once, you must watch it again to truly appreciate it.The music chosen in this movie was also great. The soundtrack is a must-get. Unfortunately, the song Njosnavelin (Nothing Song) by Sigur Ros was never release (which is a shame because I love it). The music really set the mood and completed every scene.As for the Cast & crew, AMAZING! Tom Cruise was definitely the BEST actor for this part. David Aames (Cruise's character) was an extremely well defined character; I truly felt like I knew and understood him. Congrats Tom! Penelope Cruz also had a great performance. Jason Lee was remarkable as a supporting actor. Cameron Diaz really did a great job for her character Julie Gianni. Cameron Crowe... well, he is simply one of the best and he really does prove it with this movie.I could go on and on explaining how this movie is a great picture, but you must really see it for yourself to understand what I mean.

I admit it may be sometimes hard to follow. But nevertheless, I never felt I couldn't catch up with the story or even lost motivation to watch it to the end.

But what do you expect when you team up the greatest actor (Tom Cruise) of his generation with one of the greatest storyteller of the last 10 years (Cameron Crowe)?  Furthermore, every actor in this film brings their A-game.  Aside from the top shelf story, it's the actors that enable this film to stand apart from the rest of 2001-2.  Cameron Diaz practically re-invents the desperate woman persona and Penelope Cruz shines as love at its most innocent.  Kurt Russell once again gives such a splendid performance that you forget ""Tango and Cash,"" ""Soldier,"" and ""Overboard.""  He is sensitive yet demanding all at once.  And towards the end of the film, he nails what should have been an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor (or at least a Golden Globe) when he switches roles with Cruise.  Once confident in himself, his life, and his profession, he becomes vulnerable, scared, and angry at what his life might actually be.  Jason Lee stars in perhaps the weakest of roles, however, he gives it his all.  Given some of the movie's cornier lines, he delivers them as if it's Shakespeare In the Park.  He is truly an actor's actor.  And Cruise?  He's brilliant as usual.******* POSSIBLE SPOILER********** His performance reminds me of something Roger Ebert said about the film ""Birdy,"" starring Matthew Modine and Nicholas Cage.  He admired the skill of both actors because they had to give up what were then their most important assets as actors: Modine his personality and Cage his...  I can't tell you the latter or I'd give away the movie.  However, if you are familiar with Roger Ebert or ""Birdy"" you may have guessed it.  But the point is, Cruise must give up both of the assets to express the confusion and anger of David Aames.

Watching this movie in that frame of mind will over complicate it and thus you will not enjoy it at all. Watching the movie for what it is simply a Sci-fi film will make you appreciate and understand it.

Excellently directed, haunting imagery- an abandoned New York being particularly haunting- and an absolute fantastic soundtrack. In fact the soundtrack is easily the best thing about this film. It is almost entirely pitch perfect with excellent artists such as Radiohead, REM, Jeff Buckley and Paul McCartney all seamlessly working into the film.Now the drawbacks. The acting in this film is not exactly great. Cameron Diaz tries her hardest but her character is very little for a character to do and she just ends up a serious of clichés. Penelope Cruz's character can't seem to match up to her one in the original and just leaves the viewer baffled as to what all the fuss is about. Worst of all however is Tom Cruise himself. I'm not sure if this is just a personal problem I have with Cruise or not. I enjoyed him in Magnolia but everything else he's been in has just annoyed me. He's excellent at playing the cocky spoilt rich kid role that he's been perfecting all his career but when his character takes a dark turn Cruise just doesn't have the chops to pull it off. His brooding in the interrogation scenes is almost unwatchable.Worst of all, however, is the dialogue. It is clunky and is almost embarrassing when it's being spoken. See for example the attempts to explain the film at the end. It is one of the most boring ways possible to finish a film just by having a character you have barely met lifelessly explain it all. Line after line of it is spewed out by the actors but it never really seems to be going anyone.This is a great concept for a film and was done exquisitely well .... in the original. For anyone interested in the film I'd recommend the original by far.",Vanilla Sky
931,wicherk,"Well, sigh.",3,2 November 2006,"What can I possibly say that hasn't been already said in the 114 pages before me? How about this: It has been 5 years now. Can we at least admit that the film's popularity has not withstood the test of time? The novelty of a plot twist and beautiful people may win you some ecstatic early reviews, but the arguments that it begins do not have the depth to become the kind of things you will want to share with your children twenty years from now.Or how about this: I wish I understood Mr. Crowe's motivation in making this film. It lacked the innocent exuberance of Almost Famous, a place where great music made the story better. Here, pretty effects and some good music may create some individually beautiful scenes but they only serve to distract from the tension of the underlying story. Which, in order to be compelling needed all of the tension it could get.Which reminds me, I would be really excited to see what a minimalist version of Mr. Crowe's work would look like. If he learns (or relearns?) the discipline to cut scenes that, while beautiful in themselves, only distract from the underlying story, will make better movies. It worked for Almost Famous, it was lacking in Elizabethtown. (Just throw them on the DVD as extras. They won't be lost.)Sad conclusion: It was just an uninteresting film with some good music. It could have been good if the story had not been lost to the eye/mind candy. I have lost respect for his other work because of this one.I think I'll go back and finish the Decalogue now; you kids have fun out there. (I managed to review the film without talking about Tom, that is worth something right?)",Vanilla Sky
932,jelnoh,"An interesting film filled with plot twists, worth watching twice...",7,1 May 2011,"Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky tells the story of David Aames played by Tom Cruise and his relationship with two women Sofia Serrano played by Penelope Cruz and Julie Gianni played by Cameron Diaz. David is a man who basically has it all, rich, good looking and fortunate. He has everything or believes he can have it. The film itself can be confusing as the plot unfolds in a backward manner that makes it hard to grasp exactly what is going on. Often you might find yourself thinking did you see that right or thinking something as a fact when it was not what it seemed.The theme of the film Vanilla Sky is dreams and the minds interpretation of reality. David has trouble distinguishing between the two states. His dreams seem real to him, an example is when he is driving through New York and he is the only person around. There is no other cars on the road, no people walking he is alone. This is also a symbolic reference to his life and how he feels like he is alone. The film scene transitions also make you feel like a dream. The scenes cut to black then to another entirely different time or place.David is a rich guy who inherited the family business after his parents were killed in a car crash. He is carrying on a relationship with Julie however this is more of a one sided relationship, she cares for David but is only a sex partner to him. A short time later David meets Sofia at a party. Sofia is at the party as the date of one of David's friends Brian played by Jason Lee but ends up spending more time with David than Brian. David then takes Sofia home and they seem to have a good time and like each other but do not sleep together. Upon leaving Sofia's home David is somehow confronted by Julie who is upset but talks David into going for a drive in her car.From here the movie takes a turn in some surprise directions and becomes harder to follow. Julie and David argue about their relationship, eventually Julie drives her car off a bridge killing herself and results in plastic surgery for David on his face and arm. The accident leaves David disfigured or wearing a facial prosthetic for much of the remaining movie.From this point in the movie the surprises and twists happen a mile a minute. David is accused of murder and spends a great deal of time talking to a psychiatrist played by Kurt Russell. As the plot winds backwards much the same way the film Memento does you can tell something is not as it seems David sees many times a dog which was frozen and brought back to life. This leads to the discovery that he did the same thing. David had visited a corporation that uses computers and a deep freeze technique to give people dreams and prolong their lives indefinitely. During much of the movie David is actually having a nightmare. The twist and realization at the end of the movie give reason to watch the film again as you should now have a different prospective to view the movie.The theme of dreams being difficult to differentiate from reality is emphasized the closer you get to the end of the film. We cannot really control our dreams and while we are having them we are at their mercy. Much like David is, he lives out much of the film in a dream he has no control over until the very end. This is when he really realizes it is a dream and chooses to live a real life.",Vanilla Sky

937,sesrin66,It was better than what I expected,7,5 September 2012,"*SPOILERS BE CAREFUL*This is my first review so bare with me, please. So I watched Vanilla Sky yesterday, and I didn't want to write a review until I completely took a while to think this movie over. I was honestly, a little afraid to watch some terrible, yet hilarious film, just because of what I had heard about it. I mean it's 2012 right now, so naturally we have already had this movie out for a good bit, and I know it's a remake and everything. But I didn't completely hate it. The whole cast was kind of iffy for me. I enjoyed Tom Cruise, I suppose. It wasn't a bad role for him, but of course we have seen better. I'm not a Cameron Diaz fan, but I think she played crazy chick pretty well, I guess other people would disagree, but hey. And of course Penelope, who already had a little work in the other film if I'm not mistaken. She did a wonderful job, and I was happy when I saw her each time. I guess mostly by the end of it I expected a huge ass twist, and it didn't really happen, it was just a minor one. I guess comparing it to like Sixth Sense, I was just like, ""Yeah...sure..."" You know, but compared to like Sixth Sense where you're more feeling, ""HOLY CRAP, but what about...and...if..."" If you get what I'm saying. I wasn't thrilled by the end of it, but I understood it, and I took it for what it was. I'm not going to say I was bored or not entertained by this film. But it's not one of those I would watch again.Also before I end this whole review did anyone else feel weird about the whole Jason Lee and Tom Cruise characters being friends? I don't know, I was a little out of place with that, I wanted it to be someone else. I just couldn't picture it at all, even though they really tried. I love Jason Lee, but I just couldn't feel it. Maybe it was just me...Acting-wise I would give it a 6/10 (alot to do with the fact that I couldn't hear Tom Cruise at points, and Cameron Diaz just didn't cut it for me) Visually-8/10 Movie-7/10",Vanilla Sky
938,imdb-x-e_mail,One of my favorites: The Third Time Was A Charm,10,2 April 2004,"I watch hundreds of movies every year.  Even though I saw Vanilla Sky in 2001 after the initial release, Vanilla Sky has only recently become one of my favorites of all time!  I have never before cried with tears rolling down my face in my decades of movie going - I have had my eyes water, but have never been moved to the point of actually crying out loud with tears until I saw this movie for the third time.  I am retired from the U.S. Marine Corps, so I was embarrassed as hell, trying to hide my tears from my wife.The first time I saw Vanilla Sky in the theater, I was not significantly impressed, I enjoyed the movie and I felt that I understood the story, but there was no real impact upon me when compared with other films I have watched.  At the time I would not have even considered the film among my favorites. The first time you watch this movie, you may even be a little confused or disappointed.  The first time is not a loss though as the actors are beautiful in all aspects.  If you have not seen Vanilla Sky, during your first viewing keep in mind that the movie is far deeper than what you may understand or grasp in that first viewing alone.  Just enjoy watching the film; do not try to figure anything out.  I really think of the first viewing of this movie as more of an introduction - don't try to judge the film upon this first view; just watch.  Maybe this is why Vanilla Sky did not receive the best of reviews.  How many times does a movie reviewer watch a film before writing, once or twice at the most?Vanilla Sky is like work of art, upon first glance you may find the film distasteful, but with further study you begin to see the magnificence of the work and are moved.  The more you watch, the more you may appreciate and cherish.  The film has a depth and longevity that a typical blockbuster-type movie does not.  This appreciation of the movie has to be developed over several viewings; this quality likely came at a severe sacrifice to box office sales and initial reviews.  I am sure that most of the success of this movie at the box office was carried upon the shoulders of the famous actors and director involved.  But, this is a perfect movie to own on DVD because you will enjoy watching the film again and again and with each viewing you may discover something new.  After watching Vanilla Sky several times, you begin to notice the intricate details woven within the story. There are many powerful themes to be discovered in Vanilla Sky.  The most appreciated things in life do not come to us easily, don't watch this movie just once, you will never appreciate the greatness of the film.",Vanilla Sky

940,Tom-J,second chances,10,7 August 2004,"do not read on if you have not seen the movie. it gives away too much.i really enjoyed the film. i first saw it over two years ago and it remained somewhere at the back of my mind, tugging at me. i recently decided to buy the DVD and have since watched it several times - occasionally with stop frame or close caption for assistance. my appreciation for the film has grown during the recent period of viewing / study. it's a love story that transcends dimension. ""i'll find you again"" the dream version of sofia says to David. here is the notion that love might transcend the limits /confines of one's own mind and actually form a connection between lovers. this is essentially David talking to himself, his internalized sofia also tells him that ""it's a problem"" because she really is not there (she's dead and he's frozen, dreaming all of this). yet the yearning to make such a connection across impossible ontological boundaries is what our fantasies of true love always tell us. (in a Jungian sense, this is possible, we are all connected through the fabric of the collective mind [by the way, the book sitting on the table when mccabe is talking to David is ""memories, dreams, reflections"", Carl Jung's autobiography!]) (I also think that the recent movie, ""eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"" plays with this theme as well). love must try to find a way through the impossible labyrinth of mind and the reality it presumes to know. along with this, one's very own identity / existence is called into question and the adventure of finding love becomes tantamount to finding oneself.mccabe gently scolds David for being ""careless"" with julianna. indeed, it is David's guilt which is the ""glitch"" or bug in the system. it is what derails what should have been paradise, it's the evil seed, the apple. the ""sweet and sour"" speech is replayed throughout the dream as a leitmotif with a simple lesson to be memorized and not forgotten; an opportunity to not make the same mistakes over again. yes. the little things can embody the meaning of the whole if one has the faith, the determination and the heart to keep up with the ""search"" - even when it is not exactly clear what it is that is missing. i also want to mention that the musical tracks which support and interweave this movie are wonderful. the sigur ros track ""njosnavelin"" is haunting, sad and ethereal. and i never imagined the beach boys ""good vibrations"" in quite such a context before. i think the choices for the soundtrack were really artful and inspired.",Vanilla Sky
941,dan-rox,Very fun ride!!!,8,5 March 2005,"After watching ""Vanilla Sky"" then watching the original ""Abre Los Ojos"" or ""Open Your Eyes"", I must say I enjoyed Vanilla Sky the most. Oh, its true that it is almost frame for frame the same as the original, made in 1997, and it is also true that they even seem to have found actors that look very similar to the original cast. In fact, one is the exact same actor - Penelope Cruz. However, it does not, in my mind, take away from the fact that ""Vanilla Sky"" was very well made and i thoroughly enjoyed the trip.Now, when comparing the two films I can absolutely agree that ""Vanilla Sky"" is nothing more than a photocopy - its obvious! Or is it? You see, I feel this movie IS a copy of the original in structure but certainly not form. One can shoot the same object in a different way and thereby impose a different vision to the objective viewer. That is certainly the case here.I feel that though these two movies are identical, ""Vanilla Sky"" stands out in style and presentation. This always helps to immerse the viewer, if only for around 120 minutes, into the world presented on screen. However, I did very much enjoy ""Abre Los Ojos"" and I would highly recommend it to anyone. It certainly does have its own merits. Oh, but be prepared for subtitles, which I'll admit, takes me out of the moment.Thanks for indulging me.",Vanilla Sky
942,rayd-4,good ending bad movie !Spoilers!,5,6 September 2004,"This was a decent movie ruined by a terrible soundtrack. The story takes forever to get going, and when it does things gets very confusing until the end. There are some good twists in the story, but the atmosphere is ruined by bad choices in music. For example, the scene where he finds out he's dead and frozen is accompanied by ""good vibrations"" by the beach boys; and the scene where he kills his girlfriend uses ""what if god was one of us"". What is that? Moments like these are numerous and completely ruin the impact that those scenes could have had. However, the ending of this movie was very good. I enjoyed the last 15 minutes because everything finally made sense. It was a relief to see a movie that explains itself after a confusing story; unlike some other movies I could mention(The matrix: revolutions) Overall I'd recommend waiting for this one on television .",Vanilla Sky

As with music and other art forms, people are rarely intelligent enough to appreciate something the first time around that they are exposed to it, it is after the same idea has been recycled a few times that people can finally respond to it, which is quite boring.Vanilla Sky again I think has gotten some inspiration from Abre los ojos which is featuring the same actress Penelope Cruz, but I don't think this is as much plagiarism as Inception is a plagiarism of Vanilla Sky.",Vanilla Sky

May bring back some nostalgia but in reality it does make one think of the relationships people make and their choices with those relationships. The characters seem real and lively.

949,robecs1,The chef prepares a special menu,8,8 July 2006,"This has to be one of the hardest reviews to write. A bit of a strange idea to have it as the first review I ever put on the site but here goes.Vanilla sky has been labelled many things. Hogwash, BS, a carbon copy of Amenabar's original, Crowes Magnum Opus. Many viewers found that the ending was somewhat juvenile insomuch as the first rule of creative writing being ""don't' end the story with it was all a dream"". Still, I freaking' love this film! Not because of the ending, In fact I find the ending a little annoying to be perfectly honest. As Chuck Klosterman wrote in Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs the choice made by Cruise/Ames at the end of the film merely shows a desire for 'integrity' as opposed to happiness per se.What truly dragged me into the film was the way the emotions were expressed by the characters. the use of dialogue in this film is phenomenal and is by far Crusie's best execution of dialogue. (How the man can say 'Like shards of metal slicing my every thought' in reference to a series of headaches whilst maintaining NO sense of irony is bordering on the astonishing. Also Diaz's use of the word C** is incredibly jarring and helps to almost shake the viewer into realising either the depth of her feeling for Ames or the level of her mental instability.Anyways, not so much of a review as brief comment. please don't be too harsh.

950,telmah77,Abre Los Ojos is better,4,4 February 2005,"Vanilla Sky is the Hollywoodized, dumbed down version of Abre los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). And a lot louder. It's not bad for being a Hollywood movie, but its merits come from what it mercilessly rips off from the original. It even copies shots, editing, and formats (even a flash-black in grainy black and white!). And Penélope Cruz plays the same role in both.I consider myself intelligent enough to figure out the plot without being hit in the head with it, so I prefer the more obscure, ambiguous original. It's also a lot more suggestive, rather than the expensive, explicit Vanilla Sky. There is no ILM in Spain, so they make up for the lack of special effects with interesting gaps and well constructed suspense.Overall, I believe this is a meddling remake, which does not really add much interesting material to the original (nor get rid of its flaws). It's on the line of the Psycho remake, and we know how that turned out.Yet I am Spanish, so there's also a bit of a bias here. Only a bit, though.",Vanilla Sky

However, as these are my favorite movies of all time I can see the difference between them and would like to attempt to explain this.Open your eyes: An extremely ""real"" feel and vibe that only truly distorts at the end but still keeps it's ""real"" feeling throughout. For me it gave off a sad and very real/plausible story. I found relating and understanding this version to be easier than that of vanilla sky (which I will continue to explain).Vanilla Sky: This was more an epic tale of a love story gone wrong and constant confusion portrayed throughout the film. This version feels a lot less ""real"" and actually tries to make scenes euphoric (like when the operation starts and the soundtrack ""what if god was one of us"" plays). This version is more for the person who wants to ""feel more"" as realism escapes this version and the sad themes are embraced instead of making the audience feel at a loss (for lack of a better description.) Conclusion: Open your eyes and vanilla sky are equally great. However, if you prefer a better understanding and raw emotion than open your eyes is for you. If on the other-hand you prefer (like myself) euphoric emotion and confusing themes throughout than vanilla sky is for you.",Vanilla Sky

It's such a multi-layered story that none of the people I know who have seen it can agree on what it's central message is - or whether Tom Cruise's character is experiencing a dream within a dream. This is backed up by the other reviews I've read none of which seems to be reviewing the Vanilla Sky I went to see. In my opinion, it's a life lesson about the fact that unless you've had it sour in your life, you'll never be able to appreciate the sweet.

Movie also takes place in New York, what is totally irrelevant to the plot or to the message of the film.It is obvious that this movie was built only in purpose of money making, because there are no new scenes or anything that is different to the original picture. This movie is only a little bit shorter and the ending is more naive than it should be.My opinion is that this movie should not have ever seen the daylight and I wish people would watch the original instead of this one!",Vanilla Sky

Bitter sweet , beautifully filmed , full of melancholyThe best thing about this film is the soundtrack , I got it when it came out because it has a new version of R.E.M's 'All the right friends' and I love that they use 'Sweetness Follows' . It just seems that films around this period really used songs well , similar to 'Cruel Intentions' in this respectIt's much maligned for some reason , but it's a visual feast and full of emotion with fantastic performances, especially from the female leads , Diaz and Cruz",Vanilla Sky
961,spamofilo,Unnecessary remake,1,23 September 2015,"This movie is an unnecessary remake of ""Abre los Ojos (1997)"" from Alejandro Amenábar.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125659/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 Watch the original instead.P.S.: IMDb requires me to write at least 10 lines. I have already said what I wanted to say, but to meet the requirements I will write the lines. I think a movie is a work of collective art, and thus a remake is a mere fake. This movie is therefore a faked ""Abre los Ojos"". You can watch it and you will enjoy it. But there is something false and wrong in it. I think that the U.S. film industry is so rich that it can afford to remake a whole film just to avoid dubbing the original or to spare the viewer the ordeal of reading subtitles. Maybe they just do it to make a profit out of it, without supplying the ideas, the creative part of art, i.e. by cheating. This is nevertheless, in my eyes, something quite monstrous. Therefore I give Vanilla Sky the lowest mark, 1 star.Thanks for reading!",Vanilla Sky

963,ian-ward3,Yet another pointless remake.,6,11 April 2005,"If English speaking cinema-goers could learn how to read subtitles, we would be spared having to watch remakes of films that were made perfectly well in the first place. There is nothing particularly wrong with Crowe's version, and if it had been an original piece of work I would be hailing it as a challenging, left-field, atypical Hollywood product. However, comparison has to made with Amenabar's film, which in my opinion is superior in almost all aspects. The main protagonist of ""abre los ojos"", Cesar, is an unlikable character, whom it is difficult to warm to. Contrast this with Cruise's David, all of whose actions have some reason other than his being a spoilt playboy. Crowe, who is a filmmaker I admire, has lost all the ambiguity, and a good deal of the mystery, of the Spanish original. He spells out everything,as if a multiplex crowd could not be expected to draw its own conclusions, or even leave the theatre without any conclusion. I would compare this to ""Donnie Darko"", where the movie seemed so much better before everything was clarified on the DVD release. So my wish for Hollywood is to stop plundering other nations' film archives, and for English speakers to overcome their prejudices against movies in other languages.",Vanilla Sky

Very few movies have this effect, and it is almost as if you are in a dream while watching it. I guess the words that I would use to describe this movie are ""hautingly beautiful"" When the movie is over, you are left with an indescribable feeling (well I am anyway). I also think that this movie has the BEST soundtrack of any movie. I think the music definitely contributes to the surreal feeling of this movie. However, (this part will hopefully make it to the big movie execs) I was completely disappointed that my favorite songs from the film were not included on the soundtrack (Ladies and Gentlemen we are floating in space by Spiritualized, which plays as Sophie is walking in to David's Memorial; and Njosnavelin by Sigur Ros which plays as David jumps).

965,iaeolan,This is a revolution of the mind...,10,6 July 2006,"I saw ""Vanilla Sky"" in theaters in 2001, and at the time pegged it as an ordinary film which was equally interesting as it was perplexing to follow. I purchased the DVD and watched it a few more times, to which it then became my favorite film.Characters were played superbly, notably Brian Shelby (Jason Lee) and Thomas Tipp (Timothy Spall), who put foreword such a feeling of friendship towards a man with seemingly no friends. Cameron Diaz acts and amazing role as Julie Gianni, inciting one to almost despise Cameron for her less than noble actions as Julie. Only the part of Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell) made me feel as if it were lacking due to forced development and seeming one-dimensionality (Although it could be attributed to his main character flaw revealed at the end).Despite many other reviews, I found the soundtrack not at all obtrusive or overdone as some may claim, but quite essential to the emotional flow of ""Vanilla Sky"". Every musical tone perfectly fitting the scene, even though it may seem absurd to use at face value. Perfect example being ""Good Vibrations"" by the Beach Boys when it is used, ordinarily an upbeat party tune, now portraying panic and revelation.Central to the movie is the questioning of what really matters in life. What is happiness? David's struggle is truly an emotional experience once everything is displayed to the audience.If you are someone who does not like to think deeply about a movie, get lost very easily in a story or have attention deficit, please stay away from ""Vanilla Sky"". Otherwise, watch ""Vanilla Sky"" with an open mind and be ready to take it's windy road to a satisfying conclusion to which you can pick up new things every viewing.",Vanilla Sky

Lets look at Davids character a man who has it all but in the end loses everything. This happens to people every day maybe not on the same scale but it happens never doubt that. I found Vannila sky fascinating as hard as this is to believe considering how far fetched the story is, i could actually relate to some of the things that happened. It really did blow me away!

Not only am i surprised by how well acted it was by Cruise and Cruz, but also by the fact that this movie really isn't SOOO bizarre and incomprehensible as i have heard. It spends about 20 minutes after the film is basically already over to explain everything in perfect detail, and still friends of mine say they don't get it.

I don't like Tom Cruise but when he does a good film (The Last samurai, Minority Report) I give him credit. But this movie was horrid. They want people to love it because it made us think, well the entire time I was thinking when will this movie end. As far as acting, the cast was fine, but to me the plot was not there. There was no character development. We see the main character go through some hard times but he never changes. I am a huge Kurt Russell fan and in this movie, again like all the other actors he did a good job but, the fact that he signed on to do this movie makes me want to vomit. So if all you want to see is good acting fine, go ahead and watch this movie. But, if you want to see a plot or some character development you will not get it in this film.",Vanilla Sky
969,lucmanneville,Very disappointing,3,6 November 2015,"I was not quite sure what to expect with this film, Vanilla Sky (2001) is a remake of Abre los ojos (1997) probably one of Alejandro Amenábar's best films in my opinion.I've seen a few movies by Cameron Crowe and enjoyed most of them but this is by far his worst film not only does he follow the plot of the original movie but it's simply a carbon copy (even the female lead is the same !) but adapted to the American public, the film is set in New York (instead of Madrid) and the Spanish/Mexican actors are replaced with your usual Hollywood actors.As for the acting Cruise is very disappointing as he fails to click with his part from the beginning and throughout the movie, Penélope Cruz is simply flat and the sublime Cameron Diaz plays her role as a stalker very well but sadly hardly gets any picture time.But the worst part of this movie is that the spectator doesn't even get the satisfaction of understanding the story of David Aames as all is explained at the end.As if he was to stupid to put the pieces together and figure it out for himself or at least what he want's to believe.Nevertheless there is one good thing in this movie and that is it's soundtrack (Jeff Buckley, Bob Dylan, R.E.M, Peter Gabriel...)Bottom line: watch the original movie and forget about this remake, who is not worth 2 hours of your precious time.",Vanilla Sky

It's sort of peacefully depressing in a happy way. (?figure that out?) I've seen it three times and i'll still probably watch it again.

My opinion of Tom Cruise was greatly improved after this movie, due to it being his first performance where he couldn't hide behind his waxwork perfect good looks and blinding toothy smile, and thought he handled the bored playboy character with surprising ease. The movie on its own was typical Cameron Crowe, discovering hidden parts of the movie every time you watch it and great use of music on the score. I did however think that the big reason for this movie hitting a chord with me was the 'missed opportunity at love' storyline. It hits the right note with anyone who's been in a similar situation and would not be advisable to watch after a messy break-up. However one final reason to watch should be the supporting cast, Jason Lee (as always) being outstanding as the easy going best mate, Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz as eye candy for the boys and Messers Cruise and Lee for the ladies; need I say more ?!?!?!",Vanilla Sky

The people at LE surly have not followed Sophia around to see where she ends up so they wouldn't know as i suspect that over x amount of years, rival companies to LE would have people in Cryo-state. I cant believe David didn't even ask that question before deciding to ""jump"".

Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and as I had nothing better to do... and as it turned out, I would have had a hard time finding anything better to do. Vanilla Sky is a frightening, sad and touching movie, actually one of the best I've seen in a while. I was surprised by how I was affected watching it.

People tend not to like this movie so much as I do, I can see, maybe it's a little bit crazy to the casual viewer but too much casual to the hardcore movie person, the director shouldn't have delivered the plot so chewed up, he should have got a little Mulholland Dr. in the third act I guess.",Vanilla Sky

Best movie I've seen in a long time..,10,4 October 2016,"First off I just want to stress to people who are planning to see this movie,that I didn't know much about the film before i watched it, other than it was a drama/romance and it happened to be directed by Cameron crowe. After seeing Jerry Maguire i decided i had to give this a shot. I was so glad i saw this before i saw the original movie it was based on, which was a Spanish movie named 'open your eyes'Now i know that most of the scenes/story is a lot alike the original but by far this is one of the best remakes i have seen in a while. The entire cast is a joy to watch. Not to mention Vanilla Sky has a killer soundtrack which goes amazingly well with the tone of the movie A very strong and convincing performance by Tom Cruise kept me gripped at all times in the movie. Crowe manages to keep me on the edge of my seat, scene after scene waiting to know what will happen next. Vanilla Sky has all the elements of what it takes to create a magical movie with its delightful chemistry shown between Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz, and to the breathtaking visuals we see. Penelope is very believable in her role and you can't imagine anyone better as the sweet Sophia. Unexpectedly Cameron Diaz is charismatic and oozing charm even as a supportive character role. I can guarantee that Vanilla Sky will open your mind and explore every emotion you have attached to you. The story is cleverly portrayed and will not disappoint! I also want to add that watching it twice made me appreciate it even more. There isn't cinema quite like this anymore! I was disappointed to see that it didn't receive all positive reviews at first, although I think in time it will get the appreciation it so rightfully deserves!Verdict: Give it a chance.Chances like this don't come very often..!",Vanilla Sky

Anyway, I'm not here to discuss that.. but rather the club scene... David is drunk (needed to get to get up the courage to ask).. approaches Sophia with .. well demands definition from her. He fell in love with her at first sight, but now he questions (and rightfully so) if Sophia will/could/does love him in his present state (disfigured). And what if his money had gone away too? Did she just ""love"" him for his stature? Did she even know him? And who said it was love anyway? It was just a feeling, no one actually said it. Was Sophia just not allowing true love to be desecrated by David's drunkeness? Forget if it was all a dream or not, are these not the questions presented in this scene? I ask this because I lost her the same way. Something I'll never know (?) for sure. Can a man ever be visibly needy and still be loved? ""I love you"" ""said"" she, but did she actually ""mean"" it? Harder for a man with means to grapple with? Or harder for a man lacking a nice jaw? What if lacking both? Then what's left?

I'm sure most people can relate to having everything going for them one day and then it all crashes around them the next. Most people can probably also relate to wanting to run away from their problems with the help of something like a ""Lucid Dream"" to quote from the film.It also raises the issue about how powerful the sub-conscious really is. Temporary derangement from trauma (like in the movie) or Stockholme Syndrome is a very dangerous thing.Possibly the most important thing mentioned in the film is how huge the consequences of a single action can be. Just one miss-judged choice can lead to certain disaster.So to all those who have seen this movie and didn't like it, see it again and bear the above comments in mind.

The characters of this film are so beautifully played that I feel I do the actors and actresses an injustice by using the expression ""played"". This narcissistic a**hole (Cruise's character) is given a gift that few in human history have had or will ever discover, and rightly so he loses it altogether. That alone would make a riveting and poignant story, but this story has a remarkable and intellectual twist that has been hard-pressed into your face throughout the entire film. This film makes you laugh when it wants you to laugh and it makes you sad the moment you feel content. This film makes you want to feel cheerless and for that you are grateful. To have a few moments to maybe feel closer to a character or feel that you would have done it different, maybe better, maybe said ""no"" to Julia, maybe won Sophia after the accident. You might feel that you would never have been in the awkward situation of having an invidious lover that knows you have fallen for another. Just the fact that you suffer these emotions shows how affecting and powerful this film is. I, for one, feel that this film is more touching than the creators or actors can take acknowledgment for unaided. This film delivers you each human emotion in a measure that perhaps some cannot accept. From the undeniable love of a character to the discomfiture and trepidation of that same character only moments later. It spins you and tricks you and leads you on in a way that you cannot trust it, but this film can be trusted to explain everything if only you are capable of understanding. Not capable in an intellectual sense, but capable in an emotional sense. This film has an underlying sensation about it, something that you desire but at the same time something that you have told yourself to avoid all your years, like falling in love. I would give anything to have what Cruise's character had. The most powerful part of this film, for me, was in the elevator when 'Tech support' told Cruise's character about his own memorial when Sophia arrived crying. "".You were missed David..it was Sophia who never fully recovered; it was she who somehow knew you best, and like you she never forgot that one night when true love seemed possible.....consequences David..it's the little things."" ""The little things, there's nothing bigger is there?""Shakespeare's 'Sweet sorrow' would never scratch the surface of the parting of David and Sophia on that rooftop. Pain, a vacuum of pain and emptiness on a level few can comprehend is more closely in sight of that moment. Knowing full well the real Sophia has been dead for over a century does not help our poor, transformed David. How can we as humans speak of powerful emotion without speaking of true love? What emotion is more powerful? What else is there, really?",Vanilla Sky
986,gmwm,Watch Abre Los Ojos instead,8,28 November 2005,"Warning: may contain spoilers.""Vanilla Sky is a tough film to rate. Too interesting to be called bad, too pretentious to be called good,"" says Gary Paton from the online Movie Gazette in his review. Certainly, it was a stunning movie-at least with the first viewing. Viewers are dazzled and confused with special effects, sketchy dialogue, and a summary that fell far short of the demands of the story. Vanilla Sky was meant to function as a work of art, questioning the boundaries of dreams and reality, the wants and desires of our subconscious; but seemed to come second to its Hollywood duty: sensationalize.David Aames, played by Tom Cruise, begins as a narcissistic playboy and suddenly his life is scattered in the matter of a few hours. He meets Sofia Serrano, realizes there is more to love than one-night stands, and nearly killed when his jealous friend, Julie, drives off a bridge. The story begs to follow the path of redemption of David, but suddenly careens into a science fiction thriller. The viewer is not given the chance nor time to understand the course of events: the sudden appearance (and re-disappearance) of dead Julie, the reversion to his disfigured face, and many other apparently inexplicable, incongruent events. The conclusion was lofty and dramatic, simply resolving David's character and leaving several gaping plot holes open for the viewer to fall into.Although Abre Los Ojos, the original Spanish film, had less character development it felt more natural and more meaningful than Vanilla Sky. It is a film to enjoy only when one has plenty of time to absorb the deeper meanings beyond the time spent watching the film itself.",Vanilla Sky

Abre los ojos was very dark and edgy, while vanilla sky leaves a more bland taste in the mouth of the viewer. The acting is superb in Abre los ojos with Eduardo Noriega in the lead and Penelope Cruz as Sofia. Tom cruise can't handle the material like Noriega and Cruz's second time through as Sofia lacks the mysteriousness that she had in the Abre los ojos. Cruise almost comes off as a good guy in vanilla sky, where noriega was better at appearing like a spoiled jerk whom the audience didn't really like. It worked better for the story that way. Jason Lee seems oddly out of place as Cruise's best friend here and it is a hitch in the execution of the film.

Shows a whole lot of twisted love things and questions about love and reality , and the true things that matter for different people. It so happens that for me this matters the most , the love , the soul of a man , he's inner being, and this i see in this movie. Perhaps for me it's much more than a motion picture , it's a proof in my mind that it could really exist and that you most make the best out of every moment you live with your soul mate. It's a long way from reality to sci-fi , but .. what if. What if all the capitalism disappeared and economy would go down , would fall? We would all be concerned about other issues and my thought is that , on your death bed , the bigger thing you remember , is not the wealth , not the adventure , not the countries you visited and the people that remember you.

I had to watch Vanilla Sky about three times before I got every little bit of the film and this is why the film excels. Other performances by Timothy Spall and Kurt Russell back up the film splendidly and it annoys me when people say 'Abre los ojos' is much better, it's like when Nirvana 'fans' say ""Bleach is better than Nevermind"" just to seem like more of a hardcore fan.

And the funny thing, its starting actress is Penelope Cruz as Sofia :-)You guys need to check it out. I liked that one better.Basically, it starts as someone rich who have fun a lot and who keeps having nightmares. One of the girls he slept with liked him a lot and was jelous. So when she tried making him see her again and he refused, she tricked him into her car and she drove fast and crashed the car. He woke up weeks later with a disfigured face and startes seeing things that sometimes looked real, but sometimes he thinks he's dreaming. Which one is it? You need tosee the movie :-)",Vanilla Sky
992,barshas-83396,Really really underrated movie,9,3 April 2019,"I think lpAlthough i have watched this film once, quite recently, i am awestruck by the great acting and great direction. I think one need to see this at least twice to capture the full scenario of the movie. One the admirable things artistically showcased by Crowe is the significant effect of even a small decision, good or bad.",Vanilla Sky
993,cyphere,It is amazing what passes for entertainment these days.,2,15 January 2006,"Someone should have figured out that a few plot twists and a few good one liners don't make a good movie. There are details that don't make a bit of sense, and the claims used in the ending don't excuse that and the attempts at foreshadowing only manage to make the viewer groan as they become known as such. Cruise uses the actions of the star of The Elephant Man a bit too blatantly, the medical explanations don't make a lick of sense, and even where the supposed change takes place and why doesn't make sense. The story has a decent amount of potential, but the acting, characterizations, and gigantic plot holes don't quite allow this to be called anything but wretched. Catch it on TV if you're curious, you'll hate having wasted money on it.",Vanilla Sky
994,yellonet,"Frightening, sad, touching and so underrated",8,15 January 2006,"I had heard some not too good things about this movie and had probably seen the low score here at IMDb and that's why I had avoided it. Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and as I had nothing better to do... and as it turned out, I would have had a hard time finding anything better to do. Vanilla Sky is a frightening, sad and touching movie, actually one of the best I've seen in a while. I was surprised by how I was affected watching it. It's hard to explain, but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and it's quite an emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie, or any media for that matter.I really recommend everyone to watch this movie. Regardless of what you have heard about it.",Vanilla Sky
995,InOne22,This is an ace film,10,9 February 2006,"This film is one of Tom Cruise's finest films. He captures the audiences imaginations with his role of David Aames. His character can relate to us all in some way.The story line is very clever and keeps the audience on edge throughout the whole film. I never really watched Cruise movies that much before but after seeing this it shows me his true talent. My favourite part in the movie is the end where it all comes to a big conclusion and he find out the truth. If you have not seen this yet you definitely should give it a try. It's one of those films that once you've started watching it you just got to see it until the end or it will keep you thinking and you will regret it. My opinion is you should just go buy it and take a risk thats what I did and it became one of my favourite films of all time. It's A* 10/10 I promise once you watch it, it will stick with you and you will like it forever.",Vanilla Sky
996,Mcgorry6,Amazing..if you can handle it,10,23 May 2006,"Vanilla Sky, the remake of Spainish film 'Open you eyes', has received some of the most varied reviews of any film I have ever seen. For me, this is a film that requires the audience to actually engage with what is happening on the screen. As with most things in life, if its not understood, it wont be enjoyed, and unfortunately the more negative reviews of this picture appear to come from those who simply didn't understand the film. This is not straight forward, you wont understand it first time around, if you want to be spoon fed then this is not the film for you. But once you begin to gain an understanding of what actually happens you begin to understand the symbolism that it is attempting to convey. Youth, love, hate, work all of the things that effect all of us. Its a story of dreams and how we strive for the perfect world, but reality often doesn't live up to our expectations. And yet it portrays a beautiful vision of youth culture and the ways in which we search for love. Please watch this film, watch it twice watch it a thousand times because each time you do, u understand just a little more and you love it a bit more. Cruise is amazing, I would say one of his best performances alongside Collateral. just watch it.",Vanilla Sky
997,MrOrange214,Something to make you think,10,13 August 2006,"This is probably one of the most underrated films I've ever come across and I never know why.It's without doubt one of the best performances tom cruise has ever done in a film, and the supporting cast (Cameron Diaz, Jason Lee etc) only add to the emotional impact of this film.The first time I saw it was on TV, and at first, I wasn't that impressed. But then, I took the time to watch it and found myself absorbed in a brilliant story that you cared about in so many ways. When a film feels as personal as this, when you feel like it belongs to because of how you see it, thats when you get great movies.And that's what vanilla sky does, it leaves an impression that doesn't go away. And that's why I like it.",Vanilla Sky
998,Screenthrough,Awesome piece of work!,10,3 January 2019,"Vanilla Sky was on my list from a long time. So much of mixed reviews and feedback for this movie, intrigued and hieghtened my curiosity to watch it. Eventually took time out for it, and certainly glad about it.Having watched Tom Cruise's quite a few movies, I felt this to be one of his best. Expressions and body language delivered more emotions than the dialogues. This is also true for other characters in the movie. Surely it comes out from an exceptional direction by Cameron Crowe.The story line and pace is gluesome. Keeps you there in every scene, as it unfolds. The chemistry of the characters, evelotion of David till the last scene and great acting delivery by most, sums it up as a great watch.To conclude, the movie doesn't get over in 136 minutes, but stays with you much beyond.",Vanilla Sky
