0,SnoopyStyle,more stalking than romantic,5,14 March 2020,"Theodore Finch (Justice Smith) is on his run when he spots Violet Markey (Elle Fanning) seemingly on the verge of jumping off a bridge. He climbs on the edge and talks her down. Back at their school, the two teens run in different crowds. Violet is haunted by her sister's death while he has issues of his own.It is often a thin line between stalking and romance. It would help a lot if his motivation is more the savior knight and less the thirsty hookup. It would help if he's following her around and finds her ready to jump off the bridge a second time. Then it would not be so stalkery and his mission would gain much more urgency. The romance can always develop later on. I'm also uncertain about the ending. I really don't like it. In the end, I love the two leads. I wish I love this movie.",All the Bright Places
1,kosmasp,Make your place bright,8,26 August 2020,"Brining awareness to psychological problems, issues and pressure (also from society), while making an at least somewhat interesting if not entirely entertaining movie, is quite a hard task. And I'll admit my inner cynic had some hills to climb, some flaws to swallow, to see and not be on the pessimistic, critic side of this movie.Having said all that and while it felt that Mr Pikachu (he's done other movies since and before that, but bare with me or endulge my joke at least) felt like most comfortable when he was the happy go lucky guy. Not the serious brooding, thoughtful, too much in his own head Dude. Or ""freak"" as some call him. I think that quite a lot of people will be able to relate to him. Not just since the Pandemic, but generally speaking. Elle Fanning might also be best, when she can show her joyful side, but she can be sad and introvert too.This really is a warning, a social message packed into a movie. Do not take anyone for granted. Talk to each other, enjoy life if you can. Try to stay positive, but even more importantly spread that message and even if you can't tell by looking at a person who's close to you, tell them what they mean to you. Try to make the world a brighter place, so all the bright places would add up to a great/high number",All the Bright Places
2,cruise01,Emotional and better than I expected.,7,4 March 2020,"All the Bright Places (3.5 out of 5 stars).All the Bright Places is a pretty fair romantic drama film that focuses on a story and idea of mental health and depression. Which is an idea that we do not know what really is going on with a person while they are being normal. But they may be struggling mentally.The plot was okay. Violet (Elle Fanning) has been struggling with depression after loss within the family. She has shut every one out in school and her parents. When she meets Finch (Justice Smith) who was jogging on the bridge and ran into her. When she was standing on the ledge. Finch tries to get her to hang out with him. Be partners in classes. While falling for each other, Violet slowly starts living again.I love the characterization. Finch is a good young adult but also struggling with his past. He has to see a counselor regularly cause of his behaviors in class. When Violet is falling in love with him. She notices he completely shuts down and disappears. No word or text from him. Until he shows up again.Elle Fanning and Justice Smith did a great job with their characters. The soundtrack and score were good. The script was a little cheesy with dialogue.Overall, All the Bright Places is a pretty okay film. Focuses on real world mental health problems and depression which we need to keep aware of.",All the Bright Places
3,marmar-69780,all the bright places,6,29 February 2020,"All the bright places is a film that has two very good performances that carried the film in a ways that story coudnt,our leads had nice chemistry between them and they worked with each other rather well,but when we talk about overall story i must say that it could be a lot better then it actually was,it was nice to see how mental issuses can easily effect people and how hard is for them to live with it,and also how it effects their familys and friends,but in same time these problems felt a little rushed and i wish that they spend more time on them and not on side characters and their staff that felt like it doesnt belong in this film,overall this movie is a good watch that many people will enjoy it",All the Bright Places

5,jadavix,A small classic among teen love stories,8,15 September 2021,"Well, here's a surprise. I knew nothing about ""All the Bright Places"" and watched it on a whim. It's actually pretty fantastic. It's an unusually sombre, reflective film about a boy who talks a girl out of ending her own life. Their relationship blossoms - slowly - and the girl realises that she is not the only one in the relationship with problems.""All the Bright Places"" is involving pretty much every step of the way. Elle Fanning is a true star; I could almost watch her in anything, and I don't feel that way about almost any actor. They took a chance on Justice Smith and this pays off as the fact that the actors don't immediately strike you as a pair only makes the story more impactful.If you are looking for a love story, especially one with more realism and pathos, then you have found it.",All the Bright Places

Just skip it!",1,22 May 2020,"This film start with a young man ""Finch"" jogging, and he stop a girl ""Violet"" to jump from the bridge scene! As turnout, this film is about Violet and Finch fall in love with each other, after Finch take Violet to the so called ""Bright Places"" to wonder her! And Finch eventually kill himself, because he thought he is a freak, and don't deserve to be with Violet! Entire film full of boring conversation, and overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the jogging scene, overuse of the violin playing at the background scene, and overuse of the song singing at the background scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely laughable scene is, Finch and Violet playing at the self-made roller coaster park! Barely intense scene is, Finch beating Roamer at the school, when Roamer mocking he is a freak! At the end, Finch kill himself by jump into the lake! Violet quoting Finch's word at the school presentation! That's it! Another disappointed film!",All the Bright Places
8,masonfisk,PURE PERFECTION...!,10,7 March 2021,"A Netflix film based on a popular YA novel starring Elle Fanning & Justice Smith. In a reverse of what most romantic films like to dub as the 'meet cute', we find Smith meeting Fanning as she stands on a bridge ready to dive her last dive. After convincing her that there's more in life to live for, he finds himself starting to fall in love w/her as he weans her from her shell of solitude (a class assignment has them visiting places in their state & writing about them). What follows is the attempted mutual healing of both individuals as they learn to overcome their past traumas (Fanning's sister passed away in a car accident while Smith appears to be bi-polar so when his lows come he usually disappears) while signposts signal that whatever fate they'll share may not be easily realized. Wonderful from start to finish (having not read the novel), this is a story that makes the viewer work for every emotion & I believe that's a good thing here since other films of its ilk (The Fault in Our Stars comes to mind) sometimes come close to achieving their ends but get lost along the way but here there isn't a false note uttered & even at film's end, the closure was a satisfying one. Also starring Luke Wilson as Fanning's dad, Alexandra Shipp as Smith's sis & unrecognizable (at least to me) Virginia Gardner as a friend of the lovelorn couple (she was one of the Runaways from the recently cancelled Hulu series).",All the Bright Places
9,questl-18592,All the Same Places,4,19 March 2020,"This was flat out obnoxious to me. Not really because of anything it's doing on its own, but because it just feels so derivative of so many other things out there right now. A couple of kids with romantic tendencies and strong underlying notes of depression and suicide.On one hand, it feels like it's doing something a little different. On the other, it doesn't have the fortitude to go all the way with it. Nothing is inherently awful here, I've just seen it all before and recently so while I'm watching this I'm just bored and annoyed that I have to sit through this dark, bleak tripe again.I don't mean to be overly flippant about this, of this somehow helps someone deal with and get through some dark time, great. Seriously, whatever helps. But for me, I can't possibly recommend this to anyone, not after already having gone through it several times before.",All the Bright Places
10,MR_Heraclius,A spectacular movie,9,16 March 2020,"The first act felt annoyingly pretentious, however as the story unfolds and you begin to see the story from these two young up-and-coming protagonists sobering points of view about the struggles with suicide, depression and trials of ostracism. You understand and feel for them equally. By the end, the film delivers a powerful message about pushing on forward, of persevering through the lesson which isn't necessarily about death and loss, but about living ones life and finding those most precious and fleeting moments in life and appreciating them and never forgetting about them.",All the Bright Places

12,0w0,The 5th 'meh' drama directed by Brett Haley,5,29 February 2020,"Plot: A popular girl, depressed after the death of her sister, befriends a troubled bipolar boy.My biggest issue with this movie (apart from it being just another average drama by Brett Haley which I guess you could describe as a 'feel good movie', although all his movies make me feel is 'sleepy'), is that one of the main characters, Theodore Finch, isn't even CLOSE to what the character is described as in the book that this movie is based on... In the book, 'All the Bright Places' by Jennifer Niven, Theodore Finch is described as ""having bright blue eyes and extremely pale skin. He is very tall (193cm), and his feet are size thirteen"". Now I'm sorry but, does that sound like Justice Smith to you? NOPE! Justice Smith is just 178cm, which is 15cm too short AND he has brown eyes, not blue. And 'extremely pale skin' obviously implies that he is 'the pale white kid from school who looks like a ghost', which does fit Justice Smith's description either... so I'm sorry but did the director or casting director EVEN READ the book? Because you got 50% of the main character's descriptions wrong! That's like doing a remake of Star Wars, except instead of Luke Skywalker being a young white guy, he's a 75year old black guy... and instead of Jabba the Hutt being a fat slug, he's a 13year old asian kid... I mean COME ON! You can't change the descriptions of characters 'just because it suits you'... and especially not if your movie is supposedly based on a book. But I'm not even deducting points from my review for that huge mistake, because if I did, then this movie would get 3/10.",All the Bright Places
13,Azanspy,A beautiful movie.,6,21 March 2020,"I watched the movie this morning and I put a review with a mixed response. Later, I realised that there are so many beautiful moments in this movie which I just can't forget and I realised that it's a pretty good movie than what I wrote in the first review. So I deleted it and I'm writing again. ATBP is far from perfect but the makers made sure that it's a pretty good YA romance. The performances are top notch and I'm a Elle Fanning fan way before. She gave a powerful and very good portrayal of Violet. Justice Smith also did a good job and he's good in emotional characters. Other than Elle Fanning, the best thing I liked in this movie is the music. The music is so sweet and mind blowing and will be in your mind for a long time and it's an integral part of the moving of the movie. The cinematography is also good and they have captured the places they go well beautifully. The movie starts so well and I liked the first half much better than the second. The setting up was so good upto their first kiss and after that the movie slows a bit. Overall, ATBP is a good, watchable movie. Some people may find it boring because it's slow in some parts but looking back at the final product, I'm more than satisfied.",All the Bright Places
14,natcalgary,I enjoyed this more than the book,7,30 March 2020,"Don't get me wrong. the book was good. This just added more visual and emotion in my opinion as they were all well casted with actors that made the emotions come to life.To those who believe that in the movie we didn't find out about Fitch's mental instability until late, you clearly were not watching the signs right form the begining.7.3",All the Bright Places
15,jimmycoffin-751-212853,Misleading fiction.,1,13 March 2020,"A bad movie that misguides people about mental illness and and the real life world of ptsd and depression. Just sad teens in general.
For example I'm soon 40 and I never got help with my adhd. There was no help in my town to be found. Doctors hand out medication and you are on your own. There's no real life AA sit in a circle meetings for teens with troubles. It just simply does not exist. Schools doesn't have teachers that is informed or have a wider understanding of personallity disorders. Its terrible but its the truth. Maybe there is somewhere else. But i never seen it or heard of It. I tried for years and years find adult help that could eventually teach me something. Have someone that listened to no prevail. My other main problem with this modern day take on this subject Is that these fashion model girls presented here would in real life NEVER talk or look at you. They just don't possess that level of humanity. Not even those who Think of themselves as outcasts, rebels, goths or just avant garde. (Like myself.) No theyre even worse because they have this massive brick wall infront of them. Everytime I told about my problems for a pretty girl that was the last time i ever saw her. Girls in this age shun away faster then a blink of an eye if a mental handicap is even mentioned. Sadly It just a lack of understanding and bad parenting. But its still very much lacking today. It's like a very tattoeed guy always gonna be a troublemaker in 80% of the cases.
These understanding intellect projected by the fantastic actress Elle Is just make Believe.
And ohboy did I wish this gentle, kind hearted person did exist in my life. But It just doesnt happen in real life. I'm a very good looking and very nice guy that still managed to cope with my problems like million of others. But I had to teach myself and to cope with my own demons. But I never ever had a girl comforting me or telling me uplifting things in that age If they knew about my social handicap. My best service to all of you out there, wanting love and wants a soulmate. Never tell about your issues til that person has such a affection for you, You know that It won't matter. Oh I remember oh so well the hell that was school.
When I finally pretended I had No adhd and put up a happy fake smile, love came quickly. Thats the reality. And I think that would make a better more interesting and truthful movie.
My other main issue Is with this movie Is obvious things like we seen this all too many times before. Two misfit teens fall inlove. But here It's just boring sappy and badly written. And a very outdrawn and bad portrait. The fault in our stars is just so much better.",All the Bright Places
16,mister_bateman,Off-putting,2,29 February 2020,"It seems impossible for US-based film makers to just produce a wholesome romance movie for people to enjoy, without pushing an agenda onto the audience, for the most part against their will. If an alien came to earth and watched a few contemporary ""western"" films, tv-shows or advertisements, it would get the impression that every white woman on this planet prefers dating someone of a different origin. This is just not realistic and deprives a movie of all its authenticity.

and I think it's an average movie, it would be great if it could go without boring as it started.It was a very emotional and slow movie, already made for suicidal or suicidal people and a beautiful movie in thought can be boring sometimes just because it is a bit heavy. It would have been better if it was a fluent movie, but it was unnecessary in some of the darker dioles.I liked the cast and gave me the feeling of suicidal youth. It was a movie that met my expectation.",All the Bright Places
18,spasek,Pain Is Inevitable...Suffering Is Optional,7,17 August 2021,"Not everyone is privy to someone else's pain. Sometimes, people lack the perception. Sometimes, people don't want to see it. And sometimes, people are too caught up in their own pain to see it in anyone else.There isn't a person who goes through life without experiencing pain. Pain is inevitable and unavoidable. Too often, we laugh and mock those who are in pain, as depicted in this film, especially kids and teenagers. Finch is considered a ""freak"" and a trouble-maker who should be avoided at all costs. It's difficult to dislike or even hate someone when you truly get to know them.Finch sees himself as a victim; a person who's always on the outside looking in; and a person who is essentially unlovable. His own father nearly killed him in an abusive rage. And yet, Finch's failure in life was his inability to recognize his own gifts. Everyone has gifts. Everyone. And Finch's gift was bringing healing to Violet when she was nearly at the end of her own rope. The irony is that Finch is able to help Violet but unable to help himself. He's able to see the tremendous worth in Violet but unable to see that same worth in himself. And that is where the tragedy lies.The film is told well about two characters who feel broken by events of the past. It's easy to shutdown when we feel overwhelmed. And that is what Violet does, to the point of not allowing anyone in. Finch puts on a brave face; an act which he uses to help pull Violet back from the brink. In short, he becomes her life-line. Elle Fanning and Justice Smith turn in tremendous performances.Never underestimate the power of a single act and how that can affect a person. The smallest act of kindness or healing is like dropping a pebble and seeing the ripples go all the way across the lake.Ultimately, as with all people, one can only bury one's feelings for so long. Eventually, all repressed emotions and feelings will surface. Finch reaches that point where it all catches up with him as he realizes that nobody else can ""fix"" you. Nobody else can give you enough love and happiness to fix your situation. That can only come from yourself. While others can be great catalysts, the only true source of healing comes from within.Everyone should take a harder look around them to see who might need some help. Schools are in dire need of teaching students how to be sensitive to others and their feelings, for we have no idea the pain that someone might be in. Take the opportunity to be a life-line for someone through kind words or a kind act. Ultimately, that is what this story is about. Nobody is alone. Be sure to remind your loved ones of this truth!",All the Bright Places
19,Boristhemoggy,Enlightening,7,5 March 2020,"I went into this film like 99% of the films I watch, without knowing a thing about it. I was very pleasantly surprised to see Elle Fanning starring as she has not made a bad film and I love seeing her act.
I wasn't disappointed at all!
It's basically a love story, but also one about acceptance, redemption, denial and escape. It's a very complicated story and you need to think about it after you've watched it, then watch it again to find some of the nuances.
Thankfully it does bear watching a second time easily because the story is great, the soundtrack is near perfect and the acting is sublime. I think Justice Smith and Luke Wilson were badly cast in their roles but thankfully they did not spoil the film and turned in decent performances. Their wasn't really a bad performance from anyone.
Elle Fanning throws herself headfirst and eyes wide open into every role she takes on. She sings, dances, acts, crys and laughs with utter abandon. She almost becomes the person she is playing and so the role has breath and depth and reality thrown into it and the story is not just a story it's an experience.
A fabulous film to watch and Elle Fanning reigns supreme in my opinion.",All the Bright Places

21,paul_3-960-896774,Deeper than what you'd expect,8,25 March 2020,"@garcwrites :All the Bright Places is not a book I read or that was on my radar. I actually don't remember how the movie came to my attention but I'm glad it did.The story is sweet and sour, it reflects the ups and downs of life in a sneakily dark romantic way. The score is perfectly calibrated for the movie, it pluses it, enhances the experience. It goes alongside with the quotes, which may seem like throw away lines but they are poignant and make sense in the overall story.The two leads are well cast, Justice Smith is the best, casting him as the lead in a romantic movie was genius. Finch he so adorable, direct and real, with a touch of darkness that looms even in the bright places and Justice plays that so well. He makes Finch very likable in moments another actor might seem creepy, angsty and weird. He makes you feel for the character in his ups and downs.Elle Fanning is a quiet force in this movie, her emotions are palpable in her looks alone. She makes a really good pair with Justice Smith, they have great chemistry and make a good looking couple.This movie could be summed up: ""Two people falling in love with famous quotes thrown in."" Or ""a girl falling in love with her ""therapist."""" but it's much deeper than that. It's more a movie about mental health than a straight up romantic movie. It's a bit dark, messy but also has levity. It's a pretty nice depiction of people living with mental health problems.What's your take on this movie?",All the Bright Places
22,iamkeysersoze-13228,It's flawed but it's pretty heartfelt,7,28 February 2020,"All the Bright Places is a beautiful film which I I didn't expect to like as much as I did. It's really great film which is really enjoyable yet really sad by the endElle Fanning is really wonderful here. She really gives arguably her best performance here Her chemistry is terrific with Justice Smith. Both work both together and make both film both watching.Now I am by no means a smart guy, but the reputation of these kind of films always indicate that one of the two leads will die and I was right. However it is sad and well done which is saying a lot since we have things like TFOTS which wasn't sad at allAs far as flaws go, it is somewhat rather generic and cliche, if you strip it down to it's core. But it works better than a lot in it's genre cause it has heart and it is sad. That's thanks to the writing and performances from everyone involved
I think it's a teen film which actually executes it's subject matter rather well. The first half is a lot stronger than the second half but it never dips down in quality drastically.
Overall it's seriously worth watching and gives me hope in a dead genre. Hopefully we get more like this",All the Bright Places

Elle Fanning and Justice Smith are very good but still the movie never really touched greatness.There is that feeling when a movie starts and you like the setting, the music, the actors and you immediately feel that movie and want it to be good. There are some amazing scenes here but some scenes unfortunately feel to forced to unnatural. I love Elle Fanning but there a some scenes where it feels like you can see in here eyes that now she will give a performance. She is still good but it is like a theme in this movie that things are good but a little to forced or not thought out completely. There is a certain chemistry with Fanning and Justice Smith but it is never as real and intense as it should be. There is no passion, no desire.
I love that the movie is not afraid to touch on dark topics like depression and bulimia but it doesn't really get into any of it. You see people suffering from it but it is never really dealing with it or goes really into the topics.

Its not only addresses mental health, depression, trauma it is also a coming of age story.Right from the start you can see this is not an ordinary cliche teen romance. The depth of characters shine through from the opening scene. Elle Fanning does an amazing job of displaying someone who is coming to terms with trauma and how it can affect your mental health. And I think we could all use a Theodore (Smith) in our lives sometimes.The writers really understood teen issues and it is very realistically portrayed, the characters truly representing members of our society. There are people who don't care about the established norm, but are highly intelligent and do care about people. These people are often seen as outcasts, but their authenticity can move mountains.I really don't understand the low rating. Its not face paced, its not hilariously funny but does have its moments. Its a slow, deep, insightful rumble through the lives of two complex characters. For its genre its a well told story. Teen shows tend to be reviewed harshly on IMDB, even if they are pretty good.General Disclaimer:

However something was lost in translation here . I think for youth it has potential to portray the complexity of mental illness in a way that will help them to think and ask questions .There was not nearly enough plot or character development . You left feeling cheated by his choice and not because suicide is a true tragedy and you felt for him ... more because it really didn't make any sense at all . It was unclear the point the movie was trying to make . I needed more from the female lead .. how did her life actually change from this and what did she learn ? Entertaining ? Yes . Would recommend?

There are two options: first a boy and a girl from different worlds who are very unlikely to be together get together than something happens and they split up and at the ending they get together again and live happily forever, the second option and the one that this movie fits in is about a boy or girl who have a disease or had a traumatic or tragic experience in their life, meets the other who helps them get through that and be happy again and at the and someone dies. And all the teenage movies follow one of these two premises and I'm annoyed because every time I try to watch one of this movies it feels like the others that I've seen because it's always the same old crap.Despite all of that the movie is kinda entertaining and will do it if you need something to spend time, but won't do it if you need a real good movie.",All the Bright Places
37,thomasmitilis1995,JUST YOUR AVERAGE TEENAGE MELODRAMA...,4,25 April 2020,"PROS: The film is another coming of age story that deals with depression, suicidal thoughts and grief. It's about two damaged youths who come closer because of their tragedies and try to help each other. Elle Fanning is convincing as always and her chemistry with Justice Smith feels natural. The cinematography is beautiful and the music score is mesmerising.CONS:The script is problematic when it focuses on Finch. Despite the charming interaction with Violet, some things he did in order to draw her attention are kind of extreme. For example he forced her to get into his car despite his knowledge of her fears and generally made some selfish desicions that didn't help anyone. But the biggest problem is the depiction of his mental illness. The movie never delves deeply into the exploration of his trauma but instead creates a mystery in the first act of what he is dealing with. As a result, the ending feels forced and manipulative and Finch isn't eventually a likeable character. Smith's acting and the cheesy dialogue don't help as well (what is the point of the costant Virginia Wolf references?). Moreover, the places that the characters visit for their adventures could be used not only for romatic purposes but as a solution to the puzzle that they should solve in order to find hapiness again in their life.",All the Bright Places
38,mitch-bulfin,ALL THE BRIGHT PLACES (2020) - 28/03/2020,3,30 March 2020,"2020 is not treating me well.
Omg I hate the poster, even I could've done better than the graphic designer they hired. Such a bland retelling of an award-winning novel. The movie skimmed over the deeper themes of the book making the characters seem entirely self absorbed and unnecessarily miserable. It's impossible to like the characters or feel emotionally connected to the film. This film felt rushed, confused and undeveloped. I've heard great things about the book but honestly, the film felt jarring (in a bad way) and hollow. Overall it seems like a missed opportunity. I will have forgotten the tale by the end of the week.Mitchell Bulfin",All the Bright Places
39,Tron79,"Three Stars for Elle, but another depressing teen drama",3,1 March 2020,"This is my third teen drama in a row I've reviewed. In my review of ""I'm not OK with this"" I said I needed to watch an adult drama for my next one, but somehow I got sucked into Elle Fanning's film ""All the Bright Places"". Elle Fanning was mesmerizing and had an excellent performance. The movie deserves a few stars just for her performance. It looks like she was also heavily involved in the production of the film from reading the credits. But everyone at her high school wanted to kill themselves. Elle's character starts off the movie just about jumping off a ledge. She is battling the grief of losing her sister in a car accident. Then we see that one of Elle's girlfriends also has been thinking of killing herself. And then, the boy that comes to Elle's rescue does in fact kill himself. This was just too depressing to watch. Even if teen suicide is this prevalent, this movie does nothing to help the situation. It makes me recall ""13 reasons why"". I guess if we want to put a focus on teen suicide, give us some hope and a suggestion on what to do. Elle's character is left with a second devastating loss when her boy friend commits suicide. Somehow it looks like she will be OK. The group therapy session that Finch attended looked like a good positive start, but I got mixed messages. If anything it just showed that others from the high school were also considering suicide and the group may have actually made things worse for Finch. Give us something to hope for please. Give us a way out that will help these teens not feel so alone and helpless. I I was left just feeling totally helpless and devastated by the end of the movie. Elle's character's final speech that she read from her travel diary missed the mark for me. It was overly sentimental and lost some of the realism of the moments they experienced. I would have liked less poetry and more actual experiences and some suggestion of where we go from here in our schools.",All the Bright Places
40,believeinflight,Cinematography might be the best of any movie,8,24 September 2020,Seriously good movie. Worth a watch. Definitely missing some details that would have been definitely worth mentioning because 100 % just thought she needed to where glasses but actually they are her sisters. That would have been nice to know. And some other stuff that is just missing. But overall good movie and the cinematography is breathtaking. One of the most beautiful movies and absolutely moving score.,All the Bright Places
41,Begovil,DIVINE,9,16 May 2020,"What I love most about this film is not just AMAZING Finch who represents that group of angels that we lose because they're alone in the darkness of their traumas but also that Violet is brave enough to be herself instead of pretending she's all cool just for the sake of fitting in. Because if she wasn't then she'd have to face her ghosts and demons all alone back at home, and that's not cool. In connection with that I also like the fact that the people around her don't just turn into dicks to make jokes about her taking advantage of her vulnerable status, as we are used to see in most American films... And that is refreshing. Times are changing, and they're changing for the best as we are becoming way more considerate, less rude and less stupid for the sake of being ""tough"" ever since we decided to leave behind all that end of the XXth century crap. We are becoming better people and I see that almost every time I get out of my head to have a look around. And I think that this film is modern enough to reflect that new freedom where we get to be whoever we want to be without caring about what we're gonna get in return. And if you think about it, that's the only way.
But this film is all about Finch. I got him. I feel the same way as he does. Always have, but I am a woman. We woman get more support when we are alone as it's easier to see our frailty. Please be generous. Don't be so suspicious so that you can see that there are more angels than creeps out there. There are way too many people who are just alone when it's too soon in life. Please be kind.
Thank you director and crew for making a film like this.",All the Bright Places

All the Bright Places, is an emotional tale that taught us about mental illness and a lot about how to move on in our lives, It's the kind of film that gets on your nerves with every element in it, be it the music, cinematography, acting, dialogues, it's a brilliant film. I liked the way Brett Healy build a connection with the places and characters, It's pure human emotions. Like Finch, I also want to run away, it's dismay that I don't have a car, nor I don't know anything about driving but yes, I can run away all night around the block.In this Lockdown, All the Bright Places is a perfect watch for you to retune your life, forget about the future and live in moments, embrace your life and learn to move on, learn to forgive yourself, and learn to share your feelings or what's going on in your mind. Try to study the people around you and try to help them get over.

The film's beginning is as interesting as its ending. Since the movie is pretty much indicative of the need to heal following a bad incident, there is a lot of positive space in the screen including lovely shots of a cold-water river (which plays a significant part in the story) and long meadows parallel to long and quiet roads. The silence can be almost felt. Both the lead characters (Violet and Finch) bring out a genuine praise-worthy performance. Elle Fanning (Violet) and Justice Smith (Finch) portray characters that are not very easy to be portrayed owing to the behavioural complexity and uneasiness acquired by people who suffer mental agony. Even other non-significant characters have been given a lot of attention in terms of their role in the overall plot.The movie has been based on a book by the same name authored by Jennifer Niven and certain details were not taken by the makers of the film which might have improved the storyline.

The only reason I gave 8 stars is because I think they could have done a bit better at really portraying Finch's mental health than they did. To me, it kind of felt squished in at the end, making his suicide not make as much sense to someone that hasn't read the book, I think. He struggled with a lot in the books, he thought about suicide... but then again, we had the ability to be inside his head in the book. So, I do wish that they were better able to show that somehow.

84,BerkayKuscu,"Not Good, Not Bad",5,25 March 2020,"In my opinion, two things need to be cleared from the beginning;
1- Some people have an extra sympathy for the movie just because of the book. Although I didn't read myself, I heard that the book is really great. However, it does not mean that its movie adaptation will also be of the same quality.
2 - The movie is mainly concerned of the theme of depression, to which many people can relate easily. Since people can relate to the movie easily for the sake of its theme, this connection boosts people's opinions on this movie.These set aside, the movie is a classical teen drama with decent symbolism, supported by good acting of Elle Fanning. If you want to watch a soft drama, this one is an option, but do not expect a masterpiece.

92,ava_ever,It's great...but don't try to overanalyze it.,5,28 April 2020,"All The Bright Places comes off as another basic coming of age, teen flick.Is it?
Yes.
Does it have a deeper artistic meaning also though? Also Yes!I was happily surprised at the depth of the overall content in regards to mental health and grief and how none of it really makes sense when you're feeling it. That's just it. The story is a bit unequal but I think that's fitting because well, Violet and Finch are CONFUSED and HURTING. Of course that plot should be messy and confusing to some degree. However, there were one too many gaps for me and too many other stereotypical-awkward-teen-film moments that took away from that ""artistic"" perspective I was trying so hard to see.Basically Finch is confused and never gets the help he needed or wanted. He gave up on a lot of people (including himself) and that's that. It's something people who know mental illness are all too familiar with....It's heartbreaking, unfair, and relatable BUT this movie really made him seem more of a straight up uncaring human than a ""hero"" (or whatever) who ""saved"" Violet.
The cockiness from his character and the fact that he only ever wanted Violent was when she didn't want him was really frustrating to me. The second she needs him, he's gone or being verbally aggressive / emotionally distant. Bottom line is, his character came across as rather manipulative which made it hard to follow his emotions and where the plot was going or what he was TRULY feeling.But ALL of that crap is just the trauma, right?Well... I don't know. You could break this film apart in ten thousand different ways and make it awful or amazing. It has some beautiful eye opening qualities as well as some rather empty and almost offensive qualities.You be the judge. Would I recommend watching it? Absolutely. Elle and Justice are fantastic actors here.",All the Bright Places

finch didnt have to die for the story to be meaningful , he didnt have to die to prove any point , he couldve moved away , hollywood's obsession with death towards the end of the movies is NOT good. Maybe ending the movie without telling us wether he died or not , wouldve been this great movie into a fantastic one.",All the Bright Places
94,ilvlftuup,"Great Subject Matter, Cliche Execution",6,15 May 2021,"I wanted to love this movie. I'm a fan of Elle Fanning, She's an amazing actor and always elevates whatever she's working on. I'm also an advocate for people struggling with mental health issues, and I feel like an opportunity to address them in a film about people with mental health issues was lost.The lead roles were wrongly cast in this film. When two people are going to interact with such intense subject matter, there needs to be two actors that have chemistry, and I felt a lot of manufactured chemistry here - which is something that is uncomfortable and distracting.Elle Fanning definitely showed up for this role - she represented depression and grief accurately and believably. Justice Smith comes across as sort of this bright & shiny teen dramedy actor embarking on their first indie film role, and represents his character's struggle in a sanitized way compared to Fanning.What I was hoping for was something that distanced itself more from the look and feel of a current teenage drama series. I wanted to be drawn in, I wanted to find inspiration - and instead I found myself trapped in cringeworthy moment after cringeworthy moment.Also glaringly noticeable - Luke Wilson's minuscule role. He's another amazing actor who is underutilized, and has a talent for rescuing films from mediocrity. He generally plays the same guy in most of his films and series, but what he brings something memorable. Unfortunately, he was buried in this film.Dear All the Bright Things, I hope someday someone will reboot you, and make you the film you were meant to be.",All the Bright Places

They missed some vital points that build the characters into people you can relate to. This film was bland and I felt like half of it was missing. They could have included so much more detail and made this into something special - completely disappointed.

98,damlacivici,Boring!!,3,15 March 2021,We started watching the movie as 3 people and i was the only one watching it begore even halfway through the movie. I pushed myself soooo hard and believed that it will get somewhere. I was so bored but still kept on waiting that some excitement or something will happen and make it worth my time. Nothing happened.

101,amandawillett0,Almost full brightness of a film,10,1 March 2020,"I really wanted to give this film a 10 but I will say this film did mess up a tad in some areas (that is if one has read the book).I truly loved this story as a book, it's so raw and intense with emotion that truly gets you soaked up into all the events and characters. I read this book within a day and cried my eyes out. When I heard about the film I was both excited and both anxious. Just cause knowing I wanted it to be true to the book, but like in all films they do end up changing things which kinda bothers me. So I had to see this as a own adaption and it's own partake for this film (especially since Jennifer Niven the author of the book did help with the film). Only to see quite a few scenes were mixed up like the tree scene, the character of Roamer and how he was kind of combined with Ryan Cross and the whole interaction thing with Violet getting to know him through Instagram instead of Facebook to name a few flaws.
BUT I want to say also that Elle Fanning really shined through this film as Violet and pretty much stole the film. Her acting range truly shined, she can make you feel in the moment and feel that sense of anger, sadness, joy and fear when she expresses it. I truly felt Violet through her the whole film and I couldn't say anything negative about her.
For Finch I will admit his character was truly twisted in a sort. Only because he was described very differently from the book to film. Justice Smith still did a great job and I'm sure a lot of book fans are disappointed in what Finch came to look like on screen. HOWEVER...Justice still did a great job in what his character was all about. I believe it's important to give actors a chance even though they are described so differently. A big flaw to some people but I will not be the one to judge on that.
As far as chemistry goes for the two main leads...I surely saw that between Elle and Justice's characters. They complimented each other on so many scenes and you could feel the love they had for each other when those passionate moments came. Which makes it harder to watch in the end when Finch strays away.Overall this film seen separate from the book was really well done if you don't compare it to the book. Yes I honestly wish once again there were things that the book had that the book didn't. But we can't always have exactly what we want, it still showed the grief, struggles passion and vital quotes that needed to be said. Along with well done performance from Elle Fanning who truly is coming through her acting ability (and singing which she has done in the past) and beyond. That this film was a treasure to watch in it's own way. ""Ultra-Violet and Freak Finch"" still managed to hold that brightness in this film even in the dark moments and differences based off a book adaption.",All the Bright Places

To kill themselves if they suffer from anxiety or other worse mental things? If your father beat you as a child, what can you learn from this movie? Is death the way to wake up?

The point of the book disappeared. They skipped so many important parts. I just don't understand - you have two INCREDIBLE actors and amazing story and you make some mediocre teenage drama. This book is so much more than this, and movie is so foggy. They just had to make Finch and Violet have inner monologues to explain their emotions and actions. And the end? It's so confusing and kinda stupid if you think about it and you haven't red the book, because it's so sudden.

In the movie, Violet played by Elle Fanning, appeared angry, harsh, and downright dislikable. Don't even get me started on the actor who played Finch.... I love Theodore Finch, and this movie ruined my mental image of Finch. I'm genuinely sad because I love this book and I was eagerly waiting to watch the movie, but now I wish hadn't. The movie was boring, pretentious, missed out so crucial parts from the book and altered too many unnecessary things.Netflix ruins everything.

Finch is actually quiet selfish- he comes across as an unlikable character unlike the previous charm. Violet is whiny and less is made of her fear of cars and how Finch changes that. The book itself has heart and could even be funny, whereas the movie lacks any charm and makes the characters 2D and hollow.",All the Bright Places

Bell tower, are you there??)I don't always feel like movies make a good adaptation from books. The director tried his best to portray the book in minimal time by highlighting key points. But the small moments he missed over here and there adds worth to the story.The director failed to show the pain of Finch and his worries that led him to ""Darkness of Blue hole"" The toxic relationship with his father, the bookstore flip flaps, Finch's closet with stars and many more... I don't know why director is reluctant to add some duration by adding these small clips. We can watch Finch and Violet all day long......This movie feels like ""HOLLOW"" just the way Finch felt in the book (thing director failed to show).

108,heyyyoliver,"wasn't expecting much, yet utterly disappointed",2,10 December 2020,"I get it. it's a story about mental health. i suffer from some of what's been talked about and i see people saying a lot of it was realistic and it's simply not resonating with me. yes, we all experience our mental illnesses differently, but i had no idea what he was suffering from or even IF he was suffering, until he went to the support group. let alone that he would perhaps commit suicide, which yeah, i guess it's the point that we never know if it's gonna happen, but in this case it just didn't work like that for me.
the entire story is all over the place, the characters lack so much depth and i don't seem to understand what the point of this movie is. honestly, what is it? i suppose maybe I'M not supposed to get it, but if you're making a movie, it means you're telling a story. and if i don't understand the story or empathize when i'm supposed to (regardless if i suffer from what he's suffering from) it means you didn't do a good job telling it.
i didn't feel anything i was supposed to feel and the whole ""knight in shining aromour"" thing in was very annoying.
i am in no way bashing the movie, but i am extremely disappointed at incorrect, unresearched and overall bad stories about mental health in films like this. i think it's very important that we as a society listen to and watch works of art that talk about mental illness and even suicide in this case, but in a story like this (which i thought was gonna be about Violet's mental health and it ended up literally not having anything to do with her) it did not add up and it was so confusing that it actually made me kind of mad that we're still talking about suicide in such a bad way, almost romanticizing it, instead of telling a beautiful story that actually might help someone.
so, yeah. i don't usually review movies, but i just needed to speak my mind on this one, cuz i was in shock by the end.",All the Bright Places

Maybe it was script's inconsistency. I must say that in comparison to other adolescent - school movies of this era is much better and has a more mature realistic point of view.

You see doubts and moments of nothingness. You see coping meganisms and failures. And it's beautifully set up. It is slow, they give you time to take it all in, like the characters are doing.

When I heard it was going to be a Netflix film I found myself slightly disappointed. Netflix has a reputation for making shows stereotypical, and for romanticizing a lot of things. But yet I loved the book, so I wanted to give it a shot. And I really *really* tried to like this movie. At the beginning I was disappointed that they had a changed things from the book that I really liked, but I looked past that and tried to enjoy the movie.

Elle Fanning is literally the perfect Violet and she encapsulates the character beautifully and was the fan favorite for casting. Justice Smith gets to the heart of who Theodore Finch really is. I know a lot of people were upset because he doesn't aesthetically fulfill the description from the book, but as a character in this movie, he really nails why we love this person so much.One of the things that I thought was beautiful, if not a little on the nose, was the fact that we get a very dour and gray filming up until Violet and Finch come together. Then the sun comes out and both of them have genuine smiles and laughter that really warms this film. Unfortunately, there is an overwhelming sense of doom and darkness and this is a very difficult film to watch at times.I have to say we are missing a little bit of the levity that would elevate the movie, so it's not so harsh, but I don't need pandering to be palatable. This movie really digs into some very difficult topics and is not shy, which I must respect and this film can be very triggering, but necessary nonetheless.

The movie misses some parts I would have included. Such as in the end the long period Violet was waiting and received only small cryptic signs of life from Finch. And only the last of the five wanderings has been transferred into the movie, missing the other ones in which all the cryptic messages are understood and reveal the hidden sides of Finch's love for Violet. Some details have not been explained, for example the glasses Violet is wearing sometimes, that are her sister's.
But apart from that it is a movie you enjoy watching, it evokes strong emotions. You feel love for Finch and Violet, you feel compassion and affection, and it makes you cry in the end. It absolutely has succeeded in portraying the exact emotions as meant by the writers. The scenery and the music is beautiful and the acting is captivating. It is a movie that will stay on your mind for quite some time after watching and to me that is a sign of a successful movie. It really goes to your heart.

The characters seem a bit shallow although they have traumas and they shouldn't seem shallow. The whole story between them is abrupt and a bit shallow too. There was no escalation to the events and had you not read the book you would have been shocked to find out Finch's death. Usually in a movie you get to know a bit people's personalities but in this movie everything appeared and disappeared suddenly without an escalation or anything.

In life you will certainly meet someone who will help you rediscover yourself, heal you and save you in ways you though you could never be saved. Life is not easy ,its messy and you will need someone to hold onto you and someone who doesnt give up on you so if you find that someone dont let go,hold on to that person and you never know the other person might need more help you think you know.",All the Bright Places
140,bladedk-17904,Actually good,8,2 March 2020,"It seems like fans of the book are disappointed with the movie.. i did not know about the book or the movie before watching it, so i went in with zero expectations.Because of this i can say i was pleasantly surprised with how good it actually was. It might not be true to the book or as good as the book, but if you do not compare the two, you'll see that the movie is not bad in any way.Great actors, great performances, compelling story and the music following the events throughout the movie was fantastic. It will make you laugh, smile and cry. It makes you feel, and is that not what a movie should do?I know it is hard to watch a movie based on a book with no expectations and without comparing the two.

Why does he have a beard or extensive facial hair? He didn't have any facial hair that I could remember in the movie?.....For the most part I enjoyed this movie. Definitely sad at the end and honestly I was not expecting that. By that, if you've seen the movie or read the book you probably know what I am talking about. I thought the plot was very basic, and had the typical teen love story drama thing that's been going around in recent movies. That same type of feel. However I thought this movie executed some very real topics that needs to be talked about currently especially in the teen community. It showed two teens going through some real stuff. I thought the acting for the most part was done really well. It's not one of my favorites but it's a movie I would recommend. I actually think it moved pretty swiftly too. Some of these type of movies can be kind of laggy but this wasn't too bad. I liked alot of the camera angles used as well.So overall, not bad.",All the Bright Places

143,mariiroma,"Predictable, boring, shallow (visually beautiful)",2,11 March 2020,"In about 20 minutes I could already tell what the story was kinda The Fault in Our Starts but with mental health, and I actually thought it would be a better story but boy I was wrong. The beggining in interesing, I wanted to know why Violet was on that bridge, I wanted to know Finch's damage and how they would help each other. The problem is that I only got one of those things. The development of the story was terrible, everything happened way too fast with little to no explanation and then it ended, but still it seems like it lasted five hours. Violet lost her sister and best friend on a car accident, she was sad and traumatized. Finch was a mystery at first and made me want to learn more about him, but I ended up with nothing. It seems like there is a back story there, but the movie just didn't show it,. there were all this elements being throwing around and nothing really made sense or put together. I went from wanting to know more about him to actively not liking him. All the post-its on his bedroom remembered me of Every Brilliant Thing but in a problematic way, meaning: it seems that it was copied (*explanation in the end). The Bright Places project seems like a deviation from this concept and a excuse for Finch to force himself on Violet's life, but it wasn't charming or cute, it was wierd and stalking. He sleep on her front yard! He seemed to exist purely to ""fix"" Violet, a true Manie Pixie Dream Boy. It all fell flat, there was no emotion, no connection.
On the plus side I have to say that both Elle Fanning and Justice Smith did a really good job with such poor material and the movie was visually very beautiful.
On the really bad side: mental health is really important and this movie was a TERRIBLE representation. As a person who struggles with bipolar disorder and anxiety, it was a real disservice and one of the reason why I really didn't like the movie.*Every Brilliant Thing is a play (?) with a guy telling his real life story, he started as boy writing notes with brillant things to help his depressed mother, and then continued to do it for himself. So Finch's room and the Bright Places project were a little too similar. Watch Every Brilliant Thing!! Is incredible!!!",All the Bright Places

It is like the film didn't lead me at all to that very end in a way that would touch me, affect me or make me cry. It is like the movie ends and I have no feelings and I am pissed off about that. I literally couldnt believe the end. Its not something that happens to me quite often when I watch a film, that's why I was a bit shocked. Because normally if I don't like a movie I stop watching it and I don't wait to see the end to say how bad it was. But here it was different. It's not that I was amazed from the beginning but as I was about to get persuaded that it is not a bad film and started enjoying the story the end scene came and I got totally lost and disconnected.

147,livaemilija,All the bright places,8,26 December 2020,"I have to say. I am writing this without very big memories about the book, that could be the reason why the mark is higher.
I knew I were about to cry, because I remember younger me just sobbing after ending this book. And I had no wishes to put myself through that again. But then I thought. You are gonna watch it one day after all just put yourself out of this misery today and then I clicked and went on with my evening. And almost year later I did it. Finally saw it.
I have to start with the music. It was so amazing and blended in so smoothly. There where a lot of very amazing cinematographic scenes. But something was missing, all the places wasn't listed and Theo's life was a very small part of this film, even if in the book it had a lot bigger role. Quotes were changed too and the way how everything happened was kind of different from the novel. But if you haven't read it, the movie could make you bawl your eyes out anyways. Story is shortened and it is made easier to reach bigger audition and also people who haven't read the book. It gets to the main idea much faster and without details. Acting was pretty good. But the resemblance wasn't there for some. Not like I have any objections, just stating a thing. The poster could be a much better and there could have been a use of the bird and flower more thorought the film. I think in the story it was pretty important..
Overall I recommend the movie, but I more recommend to read book, but you have to be ready to cry because you are living alongside the characters and they journey so much you just want the best for them even if it that isn't what the character wants or ends up getting.",All the Bright Places

suicide is the worst, most stupid thing in the world, and we must fight it and always highlight in the movies that anyone committing a suicide if he/she waited for some time they will discover that there is no reason in the world deserve to do this ugly thing to ourselves and lose our chance to enjoy life and enjoy living beside people who loves us.

I loved how this movie caught on about mental health and the way it can control people. As much as this was a romantic/drama movie it was also very informative. It showed how significant different negative experiences in someone's life can be, and different ways people deal with things such as anxiety, ptsd, depression etc. I think this movie was written very well, and the storyline was well thought out.

I think they missed some powerful details and scenes/interactions from the book. 2 hours and maybe 2+ would have been more appropriate.The second thing, which was also a bit contingent on its duration was that we didn't really get to see their relationship except from one single montage. After that it started going downhill which was a little too soon, in my opinion. I just felt like, by the end, Violet had lost a really good friend and not a lovestruck partner.Nevertheless it was a really good movie with an exceptional, impactful and emotional soundtrack.

First of all the chemistry between the two main actors was astonishing, Elle is a favorite of mine but the actor who played Finch did a fantastic job too.
I haven't heard of the story before the movie and was so surprised of how things turned out and had a long cry in the last minutes of the movie and after it. Finch came into Violet's life and changed her forever for the better but while he was there for her (even when he seemingly wasn't as he often ""disappeared"" but he always came back) he was struggling with his own inner wars; she lost him and he died while still being in a dark place in his life. They experienced many great moments together that both Violet and the viewers will remember for a long time. This is a truly touching film full of deep moments of great happiness but also great sadness and the very important message about the potential we have to grow, learn, become our own definition of good, right and beautiful and get to know sides of this life we never knew existed. Well done to Netflix and everyone involved for another movie full of beauty and magic!Bonus points: 1. Elle also produced this 2.

171,psgomez,Very incomplete and confusing (explanation for people who didnt read the book),3,29 June 2021,"I could barely get through with this movie and i could imagine alot of people who didnt read the book would be soo confused at the end. I know that a movie can never get all the details written in its book and in the end there will be some parts missing. But in this case, it wasnt just about details. They missed all the major parts and aspects of this film. Starting from the first scence i knew i would be dissapointed instantly. The screenplay never mentioned flinch's suicidal thoughts. The fact that he was on the edge with violet cause he also wanted to jump . Not because he accidentally ran into violet in one of his late night runs!!The first half of this movie was all about violet and what she was going through and that part was such a repeated concept through alot of films and didnt represent anything new to you.The worst thing is character development. Flinch is repeatedly called the ""freak"" of the school but based on what you see you might ask yourself why? He seems pretty normal(the way he talks,dresses,his relationship with friends) who sometimes gets in a fight with one of his classmates. Thats it? Thats why they call him a freak?The finch from the book would change his style time to time and would wear clothes that were weird and different. He talked in different accents and would get in multiple characters.he wasnt part of any social media but joined facebook cause of violet and she was her only follower .He was not close with none of his family members and was pointed out multiple times during the story that no one would ever come to his room to check on him and nobody cared. His whole family and friends was in denial about his condition and they said ok thats just the way he is. He mentioned that he never had a best friend And he was dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts all through the book . The movie never bothered to mention anything about his character.All we see is a normal teenage boy with anger issue who says i get a ""dark"" mood sometimes and at the end we suddenly jump to him killing himself in the blue lake. Whithout leaving his friends and family all those notes which were such an important part of the story.How did violet find out about were flich was? In the film he never mentioned the value of the lake and had lefted her with no clues about where he is or what he was about to do.I think i could write forever about the things that went wrong in this movie.I suggest people to just read the book and not ruin it for themselves with watching this.",All the Bright Places

180,simonecprice,Heavy Drama Minimal Depth like a Virgin Cocktail,3,4 March 2020,"The beautiful lead performances (especially that of Elle Fanning) are strong, sincere and almost redemptive. It always pains me to see a film with such dark subject matter shy away from the depths of that darkness.The overall feel of the film is analogically portrayed in a scene in which Finch and Violet go swimming in a lake go ""see how deep it goes"" - they initiate the task: but never go there.Maybe it was an attempt to please the masses, or ""keep it light"" and reach less-involved viewers...the motive isn't clear.... I can only surmise (given other reviews) that it is not a result of an effort to stay true to the source material.The romance between the characters is seemingly endless and predictable, from ""meet cute"" to their first intimate moment. Though we learn all about the characters' trauma, we never have a chance to appreciate who Violet or Finch would have been otherwise, as Violet is only months removed from her sisters untimely death it's hard to but in that she's somehow grieves too long, or needs rescuing. Similarly, Finch's sole outburst hardly paints a clear picture of psychological duress, his reaction was almost normal ""protective boyfriend"" code of honor....?All in all the film hits on important themes yet fail to bring the true nitty, gritty.

182,viktoriabr-21711,People who call him selfish have never experienced deep depression and trauma,10,4 March 2020,"I saw some negative reviews not getting the logic of him comitting suicide at the end as if he did it on purpose to hurt Violet and the others. But those people must have never experienced depression because there is no logic in depression. Your mind fights against you and becomes your worst enemy. You don't think clearly or ""logically"" when you're depressed.
This is a beautiful and incredibly sad movie that shows mental health problems in a very realistic way. The point is that sometimes you can't help someone because they're too far gone. Their issues goes very deep and he had been through a really horrible trauma as a child. It is a harsh and sad reality abd some people here don't wan't to accept that, doesn't make it any less true. Real life is not a Disney movie, everyone don't get a happy ending and some people don't recover from their traumas. I think that this is a very important movie that highlighted that and it was still a beautiful journey and ending because he saved Violet, his life wasn't for nothing he saved her and that matters. This movie also showed how we never know what somebody might be going through at home as Violet's friend turned out to have Bulimia and had a history of suicide attempts.
This movie gets a 10/10 from me for discussing mental health problems in a very mature way, with incredible acting, gorgerously shot and solid screenplay. As someone who's gone through depression and physical abuse l really connected to these characters and felt their pain.",All the Bright Places

190,sofirodella,It could've been much better,4,1 March 2020,"The two main characters meet in a tremendous fast way, considering how shy and reserved Violet was. Then the story goes on with many, a lot to count, silent spots, where Violet just stays silent doing and saying nothing. I thought they were actually going to talk about mental health issues, considering Finch had some, but surprisingly they did not. I'm not going to say they completely ignored that, but they somehow did. In conclusion, it's not terrible, but it is not good either.",All the Bright Places
191,oliverlover-64552,"Good book, bad movie",2,2 March 2020,"All the Bright Places is my all time favorite book. There were so many important details that were left out of the film and it seriously really irritated me. There wasn't enough character development like there was in the book and It focused WAY too much on Violets character and left the audience with basically NO CLUE what was going on this Finch's life. Zero.
Lets talk about Finch. He has Manic Depression and an abusive dad (who was not included in the movie, may I add). He is constantly trying to find himself, changing his style and personality throughout the book and none of this was even referenced throughout the movie. Instead of a boy with major mental health issues he just came off as an angsty teen.
Okay, let's talk about Violet. Violet in the movie was way too harsh. Never in the book did I get this impression from her but for some reason they changed her completely to the point where she is honestly really annoying. In the movie she was seen wearing her sister's glasses but they did not even once mention this important detail.
Overall, the movie was a steaming pile of garbage of which changed WAY too much for it to be even remotely as heartfelt as the book. The plot and relationships moved extremely fast to the point it almost seemed rushed. Therefore, go read the book while I try to remove this horrible excuse of a film from my memory.
Hold on, one more thing. I do believe this could have been much better if it was made into a series other than a movie. That is all.",All the Bright Places

In the one hour and fourty-five minutes of absolute torture this movie was, they royally mess up the story line. They leave out the part of the book that names the actual title of the book.

Usually books that we love have a special place and we have to compare them to the movie. But I haven't read the book. As someone heading into the film writing industry I can say without hesitation that this movie is truly one of a kind. A lot of people are saying that Theodore, one of the main characters, is selfish and that he is trying to make the other main character's, Violet, life better but only makes it worse. The whole point is that he does want to make it better but because of what he tells himself he thinks that as soon as he messed up the first time it's over and he pushes everyone away so that he doesn't hurt them. He is trying to save them and himself. He kills himself not trying to hurt them but to make it so he can't. If you try to argue otherwise it's a simplistic view on the situation and you clearly have never been in that kind of space before. It's a magnificently constricted film from the writing to directing and finally acting. It addresses a problem people have that nothing I have every seen has addressed. Has a real ""Good Will Hunting"" vibe to it but with a vastly different ending.",All the Bright Places

Theodore Finch was played tremendously well! People who can only see his character as this melodramatic and misunderstood have clearly never seen someone go through depression.. Depression is a HEAVY subject and there will never be a correct answer as to why people choose to end their time on this earth but this plot shows that there CAN be bright places if you so choose to keep searching for them.

This movie is absolutely terrible. The book was so amazing and both characters were so detailed and developed and you could watch them grow and fall in love with each other. You followed violet heal but saw Theo decline. The book showed how people at school treated him as the Freak, the bullying, the abuse from his dad. NONE of this is in the movie, and I absolutely hate it. The first half of the movie is like near the end of the book. There's no character development in this movie like in the book, no backstories. It just jumps straight to it. They leave out so much in this movie. Theo is supposed to have a little sister, she's not in the movie. His mom isn't even the movie, his dad isn't. It's just so bad.

I watched it the first time right after it came out and absolutely hated the movie. I thought maybe my expectations had been too high so I just recently attempted to watch the movie again. They left out so much of Finch's story that it just makes him sound quirky and not deeply troubled and struggling. They focused quite a lot on Violet which is fine but somehow they managed to strip a lot of her character growth that makes her so relate-able.As for the story itself it misses all of the aspects that are so important to the message the book was meant to convey. I have borderline personality disorder and I have struggled with my mental health for most of my life. I have similar trauma to Finch which allowed me to bond deeply with him while reading the book and finding out they left most of his story altogether in the movie was honestly heart breaking.My husband who has never read the book watched the movie with me as well. He had to ask me to clarify the ending because he didn't understand what had happened.

However this just leads to the many issues I have with this film. The portrayal of the mental health issues in movie are not bad however I feel that the story deserved more of an Indie feel and less of a mainstream Hollywood glow. This movie fails to set itself apart from other Netflix originals, whereas the book was 1 in a million. Finch's family is not supposed to be well off at all, however their house shows different. Typical of Netflix. He also, at least for me was not what i pictured. He has the same charm and looks wise he fits but the overall feel is a bit off in my opinion. Many of the details that made this book so amazing were cut out and left behind which is one of the reasons it becomes almost cheesy. I wish this movie had gone through a bit more screening and thought because the book deserved to make a beautiful picture. It's always hard to be satisfied when a book you love becomes a movie, and although this movie is not terrible by any means and still holds some of the things All Of the Bright Places readers love it sadly fell short.",All the Bright Places

252,amberdonjacour,Wonderful movie,8,4 March 2020,"Wonderful movie. I was very charmed by the main characters. They played very well and were not superficial. At the beginning of the film I realized that Flinch had problems with suicide. That started when he stood on the bridge with Violet. So it didn't come out of nowhere for me when the moment was there. Good but quick ending, I will definitely read the book as many people recommend here.",All the Bright Places
253,miawoodland,Please read the book,5,18 April 2020,As someone who read and fell in love with this beautiful and well written book. A book that helped me realize parts of myself that needed fixing and my own mental illness. I almost turned the movie off right I'm the first scene in the movie. I completely understand that the movie can not be exactly like the book but some very key parts that were just completely missed or changed. Where's Della? Where were was finches father? The man that caused so much pain in the boys life? We only heard part of it but never got to see it. Where were the messages finch sent everyone to say goodbye? We never got to see Violet ignore Finch at first and then find him. I'm the movie it was as if she felt bad the whole timed and was reaching out to him from the beginning. Don't get me wrong they had some good moment but for the most part it was a terrible representation of the book.,All the Bright Places
254,andreeaprecup-23924,Can someone be more selfish?,6,29 February 2020,"Before destroying someone's life even more, better to stay out of it from the beginning. Like if she wasn't completely heartbroken already, he makes her fall in love with him so he can go and kill himself? Whats the logic? If you want to help someone, do it! But don't make it even worse. It's a good movie, but don't expect to feel good afterwards.",All the Bright Places
255,shannessehi,non book biased opinion,5,6 March 2020,"I did not know there was a book prior to watching this movie so I had nothing to compare it to. However, even without knowing this I felt as though something was missing from the story. It felt rushed and not having gone into detail enough. I think that the concept for the storyline was good but not executed well. I couldn't help but think Violet had more healing to do and Fitch did not have enough justification to his death.",All the Bright Places
256,rwilson-56640,Heart breaking,6,17 May 2021,"I went into this movie knowing nothing about it. It was a sweet, moving movie. But at the end it left me absolutely heart broken and I cried for a good while. Kinda wish I didn't watch it.",All the Bright Places
257,beckyryan-27835,Feels as if half the movie is missing .,4,28 February 2020,"From the start of the movie it feels as if we are missing half the information. If feels as if you are watching the movie 3/4 of the way through. The movie seems to not fill in half the story, making the viewer guess what it happened or having the make very vague assumptions. It seems to value artistic still shoots and the same sad yet optimistic soundtrack , which seems louder than audio on a lot of occasions.Not even sure the casting was a good choice , by choosing Elle fanning I suppose it will bring in an audience of people. Not worth the watch to be honest",All the Bright Places
258,yara_hsm,the book is better,6,28 February 2020,"Good movie, but as a person who actually read the book I feel like there is a lot missing that I waiting to see in the movie.
I didn't like the ending of the movie though I love the ending of the book. I just think they should have stuck with exact same ending as the book.
I also thought that the wonderings would be longer in the movie ,but they were just there for a few moments.
I see if people would like to turn a book into a movie they should just stick with book because the book fans would like to see what the expect to see as it is without changing anything.",All the Bright Places
259,Tor1lynn,I love.... I hate....,9,1 March 2020,"I loved this story. I loved how the story was told. I love that she learned from him. I love that they dreamed and experienced. I hate that he had to die for his story to be heard. I hate that everyone thought he was a ""freak"". I hate that he only remember the sorrow. I hate that he left. But it all created a beautiful story that should be told.",All the Bright Places
260,caturrina,I never verbalize my reviews but this frustrated me.,3,21 August 2020,"Usually I always like to read the book first and then watch the movie, and even though I know the books are always better, I like to give it a try.
This one was disappointed me. I got cried a lot with the book and I could feel Finch's pain but the movie did nothing.First of all the characters: Finch has blue eyes. They could at least put on blue contact lenses if they wanted Justice to do this character. Also, the book is about mental health so Finch talks more about, because he's the one with bipolar disorder, even though Violet has hers parts too. In the movie Violet has more screen time and even with that screen time, they don't talk about her background. The movie doesn't explored both Finch and V history.They don't explain fully how Violet sister's died and they just assume that Finch is depressed. They don't show the part where his counselor told him he is bipolar and that's what lead him to go to the meetings, disappear and kill himself at the end.Second, of course we can never make a 1:30/2 hour movie out of a book of over 600 pages, but you can at least add the important part of the story. The beginning starts with them on a bridge and they were actually at the top of the school tower where everybody could see them but I thought, okay, it could just be a detail...From the moment that in the movie Finch identifies Violet in Instagram instead of Facebook, everything starts gets wrong. Like the meeting, Finch never told his real name and Amanda said her name was Rachel and she was there because her mother force her. After the meeting Finch and Amanda only talked about not telling anyone about what just happened and not about him hitting someone like they show it in the movie, because that wasn't the reason why he went there. Or the fact that in the movie he only painted blue one part of the wall when in the book it was all the halls and the furniture was changed. Or the fact that Finch didn't told his real name to Violet's parents the first time he meet them either.I'm sure there were people who liked the movie and felt a lot of emotions and all that, but I think they should have kept the highlights of the book so that people could understand why all this was happening. And the fact that the film is missing more than 10 important moments of the book is what pisses me off.",All the Bright Places
261,mtparsons,Disappointed,2,29 February 2020,I read the book and had very high expectations i guess for the movie. This was a huge let down i feel there was a lot missing and the movie was all over the place. The book was the best I've ever read and the movie really let me down. I feel key parts were missing. Some was changed and stuff was left out to make the whole movie.,All the Bright Places
262,almalindbladh,Damn Netflix really did us like that,2,1 March 2020,"I read the book several years ago and it still is, to this day, my absolute favorite book. When I heard that they were making a movie out of it I got really excited. Now that I've watched it I-
It sucks.
They're totally missing all the details that made the book so great, and the acting is way off. I personally think that finch's actor doesn't match the character at all and he delivers his lines flat. He does not look like anything I pictured him to look like in the book which leads me back to missing on the details of the book. They did really destroy a beautiful story.",All the Bright Places

265,erinmaidensfx,Not good.,3,17 December 2020,"I don't think anyone who hasn't read the book would be able to follow the story very well. They left so many vital details out. I didn't even particularly like the book.The movie lacks any of the substance the book held. We're given the what but not the how or why. The characters were so poorly developed in the movie that the impact of the story failed. It seems like the movie was made purely an attempt at the writers vision of Moody teen aesthetics.The story, or lack thereof, aside, the acting was awful, the aesthetic it was going for missed the mark and it just was simply just boring and dull.",All the Bright Places
266,JenniferCobb,"Tear Jerking, Emotional, and Realistic",10,22 March 2020,"No other movie has made me cry as hard and as long as this one. It was beautifully crafted, and flawlessly executed. Without spoiling anything, I've been in the main characters' shoes and could feel every ounce of their emotions. It is so spot on, so realistic, and such a tremendous story. You have to give this one a watch. Grab tissues. And one last thing...check up on people. Listen to the lessons this movie will teach you. Most importantly, end the stigma.",All the Bright Places
267,celesdavar,Full of heart and beautifully done,9,8 March 2020,"This film kept me engaged with its music, its two characters and their conversations. It wandered, they wandered, and it was good. Very well acted, full of feeling. This was real - full of compassion, love and loss. And well done. I would watch it again for its beauty, music and love. I am glad that movies like this are made.",All the Bright Places

269,suenagindoli,Not what i expected,1,17 March 2020,"Let's start by saying that everyone was talkimg about it, so i thought it was going to be pretty good but it turned out very boring and cheesy.
The end was completely incoherent and actually predictable. And to make matters worse the acting was pretty bad too.
I'll finish by saying it was definetely a waste of time, i saw so much better.
By the way it's just my opinion so you can whatch it if you'd like to.",All the Bright Places
